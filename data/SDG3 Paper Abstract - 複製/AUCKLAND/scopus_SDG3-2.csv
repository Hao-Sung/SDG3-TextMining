Purpose: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is associated with increased stroke risk, but which risk factors specifically impact CR is unknown. Study Type: Prospective longitudinal. Subjects: Fifty-three subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy or stenting. Field Strength/Sequence: 3T, 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) ASL, and T1 3D fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR). Assessment: We evaluated group differences in CBF changes for multiple cardiovascular risk factors in patients undergoing carotid revascularization surgery. Statistical Tests: PRE (baseline), POST (48-hour postop), and 6MO (6 months postop) whole-brain CBF measurements, as 129 CBF maps from 53 subjects were modeled as within-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA). To identify CV risk factors associated with CBF change, the CBF change from PRE to POST, POST to 6MO, and PRE to 6MO were modeled as multiple linear regression with each CV risk factor as an independent variable. Statistical models were performed controlling for age on a voxel-by-voxel basis using SPM8. Significant clusters were reported if familywise error (FWE)-corrected cluster-level was P &lt; 0.05, while the voxel-level significance threshold was set for P &lt; 0.001. Results: The entire group showed significant (cluster-level P &lt; 0.001) CBF increase from PRE to POST, decrease from POST to 6MO, and no significant difference (all voxels with P &gt; 0.001) from PRE to 6MO. Of multiple CV risk factors evaluated, only elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP, P = 0.001), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI, P = 0.026), and history of prior stroke (CVA, P &lt; 0.001) predicted lower increases in CBF PRE to POST. Over POST to 6MO, obesity predicted lower (P &gt; 0.001) and cholesterol greater CBF decrease (P &gt; 0.001). Data Conclusion: The CV risk factors of higher SBP, CRI, CVA, BMI, and cholesterol may indicate altered CR, and may warrant different stroke risk mitigation and special consideration for CBF change evaluation.

The late-1980s saw the formation of the New Zealand Prostitutes’ Collective, a sex worker led organisation that contracted with the government to provide a community-based national response to HIV and AIDS. The article explores the challenges sex workers faced to sustain and implement the use of condoms in their daily professional and personal lives. These included pressure from clients to forego the use of condoms, the risk of carrying condoms amidst the threat of arrest, and the struggle to manage the use of condoms in their personal sex lives. The paper traces both the widespread support for safe sex and the fractures and tensions that emerged as many sex workers mobilised to establish a community-based response to one of the most devastating health crises of the late-twentieth century. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",HIV and AIDS; New Zealand; Sex work; women,,2-s2.0-85071936016

Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, all patients receiving attempted orotracheal intubation in Auckland City Hospital ED 1 year prior to and 1 year after the introduction of C-MAC videolaryngoscopy were compared. The primary outcome was first-pass intubation success rates by EM registrars. Secondary outcomes were first-pass success rates by all intubators, and incidence of any complication of intubation. Results: There were 163 intubations by EM registrars from June 2015 to August 2017. There was a clinically important and statistically significant improvement in first-pass success from 59.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44.1–68.8%) to 85.1% (95% CI 76.0–91.2%, P < 0.001) after the introduction of C-MAC. In multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of success were: Airway Not Predicted Difficult, odds ratio (OR) 2.49 (95% CI 1.06–5.85, P = 0.037); and use of videolaryngoscope, OR 4.49 (95% CI 1.85–10.91, P = 0.001). Overall, complications of intubation improved significantly after introduction of C-MAC (28.9%, 95% CI 19.9–40.0% prior to C-MAC introduction; 16.1%, 95% CI 9.7–25.3% after; P = 0.048). Conclusion: This is the first published study specifically addressing EM registrar intubation success rates in New Zealand, adding to the existing body of data suggesting that videolaryngoscopy may improve success rates for novice intubators. ? 2019 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine",emergency medicine; human; intratracheal; intubation; laryngoscope; patient safety,adult; Article; bradycardia; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; controlled study; emergency medicine; endotracheal intubation; female; first pass intubation success rate; glottis; heart arrest; human; hypotension; laryngoscopy; larynx spasm; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; outcome assessment; oxygen desaturation; patient safety; priority journal; rescue personnel; respiratory tract injury; retrospective study; standardization; tertiary care center; tooth injury; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85068234872

This New Zealand-based research explored young people's use of social media to give and receive support in informal, peer networks. Data was collected through digital instant messaging interviews with 21 young people aged 16–21 years. A thematic analysis identified a range of priorities participants had for engaging in support online. These included the importance of establishing emotional safety; picking up subtle cues for distress; allowing the open expression of emotion; showing care; being tactful and sensitive to needs of others and developing on-going relationships. Those designing online interventions for youth in distress can learn from the way that young people already give and receive support online. Recognising the importance that young people give to trusting relationships as a prerequisite for engagement with online support has important implications for the development of interventions which can connect with young people. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",E-intervention; Help-seeking; Mental health; Psychological support; Social media; Youth,Behavioral research; Human computer interaction; Help seeking; Instant messaging; Mental health; Online support; Social media; Thematic analysis; Young peoples; Youth; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-85071837997

Methods: We conducted retrospective audits of adherence to the neonatal hypoglycaemia guideline in a tertiary maternity hospital in Auckland, New Zealand in a randomly selected cohort of newborn infants at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia before (2011) and after (2015) the introduction of routine use of calculated birthweight centiles for all infants. The primary outcome was adherence to the guideline, defined as (i) blood glucose concentration screening in the first 48 h after birth; (ii) the initial measurement taken 1–2 h after birth; and (iii) at least three consecutive blood glucose concentrations ?2.6 mmol/L, over 12 h, prior to cessation of screening. Results: The audits examined the records of 400 infants (200 each in 2011 and 2015) to determine guideline adherence. Adherence improved from 2011 to 2015 (59/200 (30%) vs. 95/200 (48%), P < 0.001), with the largest improvement in large-for-gestational age infants (7/50 (14%) vs. 25/50 (50%), P = <0.001). Screened infants whose care was adherent to the guideline had a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia detection (adherent, 64/154 (42%) vs. non-adherent, 34/246 (14%), P < 0.001). Conclusions: The routine use of calculated birthweight centiles was associated with improved adherence to the neonatal hypoglycaemia guideline and increased detection of neonatal hypoglycaemia in at-risk infants. Thus, identifying practices that improve guideline adherence may improve the detection of hypoglycaemia in asymptomatic at-risk infants. ? 2019 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",infant of a diabetic; preterm; small for gestational age,glucose; adult; Article; automation; birth weight; blood glucose monitoring; clinical audit; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; glucose blood level; hospital discharge; human; hypoglycemia; incidence; large for gestational age; major clinical study; male; medical record; New Zealand; newborn; newborn screening; observational study; obstetric delivery; patient compliance; practice guideline; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; tertiary care center; treatment refusal,2-s2.0-85067841432

Methods: YouthCHAT was administered to a group of 30 young people aged 13–17 years with different long-term physical conditions attending outpatient clinics between September and December 2017. Outcome measures were: (i) acceptability and feasibility of YouthCHAT as assessed via feedback from young people and clinicians and the time taken to complete YouthCHAT screening; and (ii) detection rates for each domain of YouthCHAT measured by mental health or life-style issues ‘present’ or ‘absent’, and where relevant, validated symptom scores. Results: YouthCHAT was quick to administer and positively received by both young people and clinicians. Rates of anxiety (37%) and depression (13%) detected using YouthCHAT were similar to those in previous studies of young people with long-term physical conditions. Rates of other problems were similar to a previously screened high school sample. Conclusions: YouthCHAT is a viable and acceptable psychosocial screener with the potential to improve the holistic care of young people with long-term physical conditions attending outpatient clinics.

These findings have provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify individuals in the population at high risk for disease who carry causal genetic mutations and hold great promise for early intervention and individualized medicine. While interest is high in building risk prediction models based on recent genetic findings, it is crucial to have appropriate statistical measurements to assess the performance of a genetic risk prediction model. Predictiveness curves were recently proposed as a graphic tool for evaluating a risk prediction model on the basis of a single continuous biomarker. The curve evaluates a risk prediction model for classification performance as well as its usefulness when applied to a population. In this article, we extend the predictiveness curve to measure the collective contribution of multiple genetic variants. We further propose a nonparametric, U-statistics-based measurement, referred to as the U-Index, to quantify the performance of a multi-locus predictiveness curve. In particular, a global U-Index and a partial U-Index can be used in the general population and a subpopulation of particular clinical interest, respectively. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed U-Index has advantages over several existing summary statistics under various disease models. We also show that the partial U-Index can have its own uniqueness when rare variants have a substantial contribution to disease risk. Finally, we use the proposed predictiveness curve and its corresponding U-Index to evaluate the performance of a genetic risk prediction model for nicotine dependence. ?

The Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes cohort study examined associations between SSB intake at 18 months and 5 years of age, with adiposity measures at 6 years of age. We studied Singaporean infants/children with SSB intake assessed by FFQ at 18 months of age (n 555) and 5 years of age (n 767). The median for SSB intakes is 28 (interquartile range 5·5-98) ml at 18 months of age and 111 (interquartile range 57-198) ml at 5 years of age. Association between SSB intake (100 ml/d increments and tertile categories) and adiposity measures (BMI standard deviation scores (sd units), sum of skinfolds (SSF)) and overweight/obesity status were examined using multivariable linear and Poisson regression models, respectively. After adjusting for confounders and additionally for energy intake, SSB intake at age 18 months were not significantly associated with later adiposity measures and overweight/obesity outcomes. In contrast, at age 5 years, SSB intake when modelled as 100 ml/d increments were associated with higher BMI by 0·09 (95 % CI 0·02, 0·16) sd units, higher SSF thickness by 0·68 (95 % CI 0·06, 1·44) mm and increased risk of overweight/obesity by 1·2 (95 % CI 1·07, 1·23) times at age 6 years. Trends were consistent with SSB intake modelled as categorical tertiles. In summary, SSB intake in young childhood is associated with higher risks of adiposity and overweight/obesity. Public health policies working to reduce SSB consumption need to focus on prevention programmes targeted at young children. ?

This study aims to investigate neuropathology and AD-related molecular changes within the neocerebellum using post-mortem human brain tissue microarrays (TMAs). Immunohistochemistry was conducted on neocerebellar paraffin-embedded TMAs from 24 AD and 24 matched control cases, and free-floating neocerebellar sections from 6 AD and 6 controls. Immunoreactivity was compared between control and AD groups for neuropathological hallmarks (amyloid-β, tau, ubiquitin), Purkinje cells (calbindin), microglia (IBA1, HLA-DR), astrocytes (GFAP) basement-membrane associated molecules (fibronectin, collagen IV), endothelial cells (CD31/PECAM-1) and mural cells (PDGFRβ, αSMA). Amyloid-β expression (total immunolabel intensity) and load (area of immunolabel) was increased by >4-fold within the AD cerebellum. Purkinje cell counts, ubiquitin and tau immunoreactivity were unchanged in AD. IBA1 expression and load was increased by 91% and 69%, respectively, in AD, with no change in IBA1-positive cell number. IBA1-positive cell process length and branching was reduced by 22% and 41%, respectively, in AD. HLA-DR and GFAP immunoreactivity was unchanged in AD. HLA-DR-positive cell process length and branching was reduced by 33% and 49%, respectively, in AD. Fibronectin expression was increased by 27% in AD. Collagen IV, PDGFRβ and αSMA immunoreactivity was unchanged in AD. The number of CD31-positive vessels was increased by 98% in AD, suggesting the increase in CD31 expression and load in AD is due to greater vessel number. The PDGFRβ/CD31 load ratio was reduced by 59% in AD. These findings provide evidence of molecular changes affecting microglia and the neurovasculature within the AD neocerebellum. These changes, occurring without overt neuropathology, support the hypothesis of microglial and neurovascular dysfunction as drivers of AD, which has implications on the neocerebellar contribution to AD symptomatology and pathophysiology. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Alzheimer's disease; Cerebellum; Human brain; Neocerebellum; Tissue microarrays,alpha smooth muscle actin; amyloid beta protein; calbindin; collagen type 4; fibronectin; glial fibrillary acidic protein; HLA DR antigen; IBA1 protein; platelet derived growth factor beta receptor; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; tau protein; ubiquitin; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; astrocyte; autopsy; basement membrane; brain blood vessel; cell count; cerebellum; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; female; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; male; microglia; middle aged; neocerebellum; neuropathology; neurovasculature; pathophysiology; pericyte; priority journal; protein expression; Purkinje cell; symptomatology; tissue microarray; very elderly,2-s2.0-85071851806

This study uses a simple custom-built spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) system to conduct RI measurements of multicellular spheroids, three-dimensional?(3D) in-vitro culture systems, of the cell line HCT116. The spheroid RIs are compared to study the effect of growth over time. To improve confocal microscopy imaging protocols, two immersion media (glycerol and ScaleView-A2) matching the spheroid RIs were trialled, with the aim to reduce the RI mismatch between the spheroid and the immersion medium and thus improve imaging depth with confocal microscopy. ScaleView-A2 (n = 1.380) aided in achieving greater depths of imaging of the multicellular spheroids under confocal microscopy.

Telomere length was longer in females compared to males (coefficient of 0.042, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.024–0.060). European children had shorter telomere than both the indigenous M?ori (coefficient of 0.03, CI 0.007–0.055) and Pacific children (coefficient of 0.15, CI 0.12–0.18). The data suggest that telomere lengths are highly variable and variability between individuals arise from early age, influenced partly by sex and ethnicity. Longer telomeres in indigenous M?ori and Pacific children may reflect the heritability of telomere length in genetically less complex populations. This study increases our understanding of telomere dynamics in young children since the majority of telomere studies are conducted in adults. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,adult; article; child; childhood; cohort analysis; controlled study; ethnicity; European; female; gender; heritability; human; infant; linear regression analysis; male; New Zealand; paternal age; telomere length,2-s2.0-85069534841

Mothers perceived healthy preschooler sleep as supporting children’s mental and physical health, parents’ sleep/wake functioning, family social cohesion and emotional connectedness, and poor preschooler sleep as negatively influencing child, maternal and family well-being. Although many experiences were shared, some perceptions of sleep and sleep practices differed between mothers. Influences included health paradigms, socioeconomic circumstances, maternal autonomy, employment, parenting approaches, and societal expectations. Healthy preschooler sleep is valued by mothers and may play a protective role in family health and resilience. Preschooler sleep initiatives need to be responsive to maternal perspectives and address societal drivers of sleep experiences. ?

Method: The AUDIT-C and the CARET were administered to 3,673 adults aged 55 to 89 years. Classification agreement between the screens was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa. Hazardous drinking groups were compared using logistic regression. Results: Analysis indicated moderate agreement between the screens. Drinkers classified as “hazardous on the CARET only” consumed less alcohol, but were more likely to drink-drive. Introducing a drink-driving criterion into the calculation of hazardousness on the AUDIT-C substantially decreased the classification discrepancy between the measures. Discussion: Standard screening can be improved by investigating comorbidities, medication use, and alcohol-related risk behaviors in those initially identified as nonhazardous drinkers. ?

We assessed the implementation of national food environment policies and food industry commitments to improve population nutrition and the strength and comprehensiveness of public sector settings' nutrition policies. The healthiness of the packaged food supply, including health-related labelling, was evaluated. Food environments were measured in 833 schools, 204 supermarkets, 1500 takeaway outlets, 28 hospitals, 70 sport centres, and around all NZ schools. Food swamps, defined as areas with high relative density of unhealthy food outlets, were identified, and food marketing to children on television, websites, social media and packages, in magazines, and in and around schools was measured. The cost differential between healthy and current household diets was calculated for different population groups. NZ's food environment profile is largely unhealthy, and there are inequalities in access to healthy food environments. It is anticipated that the proposed country profile can help other countries tackle unhealthy food environments through increasing accountability of governments and the industry. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation",accountability; benchmarking; food environments; food supply; monitoring; nutrition policies,Article; catering service; environmental factor; food industry; food packaging; government; health care access; health care cost; health care disparity; healthy diet; household; human; marketing; New Zealand; nutrition policy; obesity; public health; public sector; relative density; social media,2-s2.0-85071751310

Our study assessed the relationship between the natural environments of residential neighbourhoods and the emotional health of adolescents living in urban New Zealand. Data from 4575 adolescents were drawn from the 2012 wave of the Youth2000 survey series. Emotional health was assessed using the World Health Organization-5 Well-being Index and depressive symptoms were measured using the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale-short form. Measures of greenness, vegetation diversity, blue spaces, and a composite available nature index were calculated for participant residential neighbourhoods (within 400 m, 800 m, and 1600 m of the residential address). Cross-classified multilevel linear models were used to assess relationships between each natural environment exposure and each emotional health outcome, and adjusted for sex, age, ethnicity, household deprivation, and neighbourhood deprivation. Results showed significant relationships between reduced depressive symptoms and increased mean greenness, presence of native vegetation, and having a higher nature availability index. Unexpectedly, greater variability in greenness was associated with reduced wellbeing. Our study provides novel evidence of the importance of natural environments for the emotional health of adolescents, adding to mounting evidence that it is important to protect, rehabilitate and plan for natural spaces in urban areas. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Adolescence; Biodiversity; Blue space; Greenness; Mental health; Wellbeing,Biodiversity; Housing; Vegetation; Adolescence; Blue space; Greenness; Mental health; Wellbeing; Health; adolescence; biodiversity; greenspace; health survey; knowledge; mental health; neighborhood; symptom; urban area; World Health Organization; New Zealand,2-s2.0-85071003228

Despite an abundance of research documenting the problem, it is unclear what the most effective policy changes or interventions are, and how policy changes might unfold over time within complex systems. Methods: We use estimates derived from meta-analyses to create a dynamic microsimulation model of child overweight (including obesity). Using census records we created a synthetic birth cohort of 10,000 children. Information on parental education, ethnicity and father’s socio-economic position at birth were taken from census records. We used the New Zealand Health Survey to estimate population base rates for the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Information on other modifiers (such as maternal smoking, breastfeeding, preterm birth, regular breakfast consumption and so forth) were taken from three birth cohorts: Christchurch Health and Development Study, The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study and the Pacific Islands Families Study. Published intervention studies were used to derive plausible estimates for changes to modifiers. Results: Reducing the proportion of mothers classified as overweight and obesity (?3.31(95% CI ?3.55; ?3.07) percentage points), reducing the proportion of children watching two or more hours of TV (?3.78(95% CI ?4.01; ?3.54)), increasing the proportion of children eating breakfast regularly (?1.71(95% CI ?1.96; ?1.46)), and reducing the proportion of children born with high birth weights (?1.36(95% CI ?1.61; ?1.11)), lead to sizable decreases in the estimated prevalence of child overweight (including obesity). Reducing the proportion of mothers giving birth by caesarean (?0.23(95% CI ?0.49; ?0.23)) and increasing parental education (?0.07(95% CI ?0.31; 0.18)) did not impact upon child overweight rates. Conclusions: We created a working simulation model of New Zealand children that can be accessed by policy makers and researchers to determine known relationships between predictors and child overweight, as well as potential gains from targeting specific pathways. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,adolescent; adolescent obesity; adult; Article; Asian; breast feeding; cesarean section; child; childhood obesity; cohort analysis; ethnicity; father; female; food intake; high birth weight; human; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); maternal smoking; meal; New Zealand; observational study; Pacific Islander; parenting education; premature labor; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; socioeconomics,2-s2.0-85070289533

In vitro studies have shown that bisphosphonates act directly on tumour cells, inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. In most such studies, drugs were added to culture media exposing cells to high bisphosphonate concentrations in solution. However, since bisphosphonates bind to bone hydroxyapatite with high affinity and remain bound for very long periods of time, these experimental systems are not an optimal model for the action of the drugs in vivo. The aim of this study was to determine whether bone-bound zoledronate has direct effects on adjacent breast cancer cells. Bone slices were pre-incubated with bisphosphonate solutions, washed, and seeded with cells of the breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 or MDA-MB-231. Proliferation was assessed by cell counts and thymidine incorporation for up to 72?h. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway was tested by measuring the levels of unprenylated Rap1A, and apoptosis was examined by the presence of cleaved caspase-8 on western blots. The proliferation rate of breast cancer cells on zoledronate-treated bone was significantly lower compared to cells on control bone. Other bisphosphonates showed a similar inhibitory effect, with an order of potency similar to their clinical potencies. Unprenylated Rap1A accumulated in MCF7 cells on zoledronate-treated bone, suggesting zoledronate acted through the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. Accumulation of cleaved caspase-8 in MDA-MB-231 cells on bisphosphonate-treated bone indicated increased apoptosis in the cells. In conclusion, bone-bound zoledronate inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation, an activity that may contribute to its clinical anti-tumour effects. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bisphosphonates; Bone-bound zoledronate; Breast cancer cells; MCF7; MDA-MB-231; Zoledronates,caspase 8; mevalonic acid; zoledronic acid; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; bone slice; bovine; breast cancer; cell count; cell proliferation; controlled study; DNA synthesis; human; human cell; human cell culture; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; nonhuman; priority journal; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85069465855

Methods: Six hundred fourteen of 678 children (aged <15 years) with new-onset T1D (2000-2013) from a regional pediatric diabetes service (Auckland, New Zealand). Results: Overall rate of PREM at 3 months was 42.4%, and lower in M?ori/Pacific children (28.6%; P =.006) and those of other ethnicities (28.8%; P =.030) compared with New Zealand Europeans (50.4%).

Objectives were to examine the relationship between plasma folate (PF) and reported FA supplement use at 15 weeks' gestation and to explore socio-demographic and lifestyle factors associated with PF. We used data and blood samples from NZ participants of the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints cohort study. Healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancy (n 1921) were interviewed and blood samples collected. PF was analysed via microbiological assay. Of the participants, 73 % reported taking an FA supplement at 15 weeks' gestation - of these, 79 % were taking FA as part of/alongside a multivitamin supplement. Of FA supplement users, 56 % reported consuming a daily dose of ?800 μg; 39 % reported taking less than 400 g/d. Mean PF was significantly higher in women reporting FA supplementation (54·6 (se 1·5) nmol/l) v. no FA supplementation (35·1 (se 1·6) nmol/l) (P<0·0001). Reported daily FA supplement dose and PF were significantly positively correlated (r 0·41; P<0·05). Younger maternal age, Pacific and Maori ethnicity and obesity were negatively associated with PF levels; vegetarianism was positively associated with PF. Reported FA supplement dose was significantly associated with PF after adjustment for socio-demographic, lifestyle confounders and multivitamin intake. The relationship observed between FA supplementation and PF demonstrates that self-reported intake is a reliable proxy for FA supplement use in this study population. ? 2019 The Authors.",Biomarkers; Folate; Folic acid; Plasma folate; Pregnancy; Supplementation,folic acid; adult; Article; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; female; first trimester pregnancy; folic acid blood level; gestational age; human; lifestyle modification; Maori (people); maternal age; maternal obesity; nullipara; Pacific Islander; population research; pregnancy; pregnant woman; reliability; retrospective study; vegetarian diet; vitamin supplementation,2-s2.0-85069901005

One cost-efficient way forward, especially in resource-limited settings, is to conduct a two-phase study in which the population is initially stratified, at phase I, by the outcome and/or some categorical risk factor(s). At phase II detailed covariate data is ascertained on a subsample within each phase I strata. While analysis methods for two-phase designs are well established, they have focused exclusively on settings in which participants are assumed to be independent. As such, when participants are naturally clustered (eg, patients within clinics) these methods may yield invalid inference. To address this, we develop a novel analysis approach based on inverse-probability weighting that permits researchers to specify some working covariance structure and appropriately accounts for the sampling design and ensures valid inference via a robust sandwich estimator for which a closed-form expression is provided. To enhance statistical efficiency, we propose a calibrated inverse-probability weighting estimator that makes use of information available at phase I but not used in the design. In addition to describing the technique, practical guidance is provided for the cluster-correlated data settings that we consider. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate small-sample operating characteristics, including the impact of using na?ve methods that ignore correlation due to clustering, as well as to investigate design considerations. Finally, the methods are illustrated using data from a one-time survey of the national antiretroviral treatment program in Malawi. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",calibration; generalized estimating equations; inverse-probability weighting; two-phase study,adult; article; calibration; controlled study; covariance; human; intermethod comparison; Malawi; phase 1 clinical trial; probability; risk factor; sampling; scientist; simulation,2-s2.0-85071998973

We investigated this hypothesis in a large, adult population-based study (ViDA trial [Vitamin D Assessment] trial). To interpret the clusters and evaluate their usefulness, we examined their predictors and associations with cardiovascular events. In 4253 adults (mean age 65 years; 55% male) without a prior cardiovascular event, suprasystolic oscillometry was performed, yielding aortic pressure waveforms and several hemodynamic parameters. Participants were followed up for 4.6 years (median), accruing 300 cardiovascular events. Principal component analysis reduced 14 arterial waveform parameters to 3 uncorrelated factors that together explained 90% of the variability of the original data. Factors 1, 2, and 3 appeared to represent BP pulsatility, mean BP, and wave reflection, respectively. Across 6 antihypertensive drug classes, there were no differences in brachial systolic (P=0.23) and diastolic (P=0.13) BP; but there were significant variations in factor 3 (P<0.0001), especially for β-blocker use. The first and third factors were positively associated with cardiovascular events (multivariable-adjusted standardized hazard ratio [95% CI]=1.33 [1.18-1.50] and 1.15 [1.02-1.30], respectively), whereas the second factor had a J-shaped relationship, with a nadir corresponding to a brachial diastolic BP of ?75 mm Hg. In conclusion, BP pulsatility, mean BP, and wave reflection are prognostically meaningful, distinct aspects of arterial function that can be used to summarize physiological variations in multiple arterial waveform parameters and identify truly cumulative associations when used as cardiovascular risk outcomes. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.",blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; hypertension; principal component analysis; risk,"antihypertensive agent; aged; arterial pressure; brachial artery; controlled study; drug effect; female; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; pulse wave; randomized controlled trial; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antihypertensive Agents; Arterial Pressure; Brachial Artery; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pulse Wave Analysis",2-s2.0-85072133193

We aimed to determine the proportion of older patients planned to receive or attending PDSC after acute hospitalization and the association with undesirable outcomes. Methods: A retrospective observational study was carried out using an electronic health record system in two hospitals in New Zealand. Patients were aged ?75 years, initially presented at an emergency department (ED) and were discharged from medical, surgical, geriatrics or orthopedics wards in three 2-week periods. Planned PDSC at discharge, attended PDSC, ED presentation, long-term care (LTC) admission and death in 90 days after discharge were obtained through the health record system. Proportional hazards regression assessed the associations of planned or attended PDSC with undesirable outcomes (ED presentation, LTC admission and death) within 90 days of discharge. Results: Clinical records for 1085 patients were extracted, 963 were eligible. Of these, 413 (42.9%) had planned PDSC in discharge summaries, and 573 (59.5%) actually attended in 90 days. Patients planned for PDSC had a similarly adjusted hazard of ED presentation (HR 0.99, P = 0.92), LTC admission (HR 0.73, P = 0.25) and death (HR 0.80, P = 0.34) within 90 days of discharge, compared with those not planned. Similar non-significant associations were observed between attended PDSC and undesirable outcomes. Conclusions: In patients aged ?75 years in New Zealand, we did not find “planned PDSC” at discharge or “attended PDSC” after an acute hospitalization to be associated with ED presentation, LTC admission and death within 90 days after discharge. Other potential benefits of planned or attended PDSC require further investigation.

This effect has been associated with the degradation products of glucosinolates—thioglycosides that accumulate within crucifers. The possible role of S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide, a metabolite that also accumulates in cruciferous vegetables, and its derivatives, in cancer prevention is relatively unexplored compared to glucosinolate derivatives. The hypothesis that consuming a broccoli soup results in the accumulation of sulfate (a SMCSO derivative) and other broccoli-derived metabolites in prostate tissue is tested. Methods and results: Eighteen men scheduled for transperineal prostate biopsy were recruited into a 4-week parallel single blinded diet supplementation study (NCT02821728). Nine men supplemented their diet with three 300 mL portions of a broccoli soup each week for four weeks prior to surgery. Analyses of prostate biopsy tissues reveal no detectable levels of glucosinolates and derivatives. In contrast, SMCSO is detected in prostate tissues of the participants, with significantly higher levels in tissue of men in the supplementation arm. SMCSO was also found in blood and urine samples from a previous intervention study with the identical broccoli soup. Conclusion: The consequences of SMCSO accumulation in prostate tissues and its potential role in prevention of prostate cancer remains to be investigated. ? 2019 The Authors.

Accurate and rapid detection of infected animals is of critical importance for preventing the spread of disease. Current detection of brucellosis is based on whole-cell antigens and investigating serum antibodies against Brucella lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The critical disadvantage is misdiagnosis of vaccinated animals as infected ones and also cross-reactions with other Gram-negative bacteria. Recombinant outer membrane protein 2b (Omp2b) of Brucella abortus was evaluated as a novel serodiagnostic target in comparison to conventional tests which are based on LPS. Recombinant Omp2b (rOmp2b) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by Ni2+-based chromatography. rOmp2b was evaluated in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for diagnosis of brucellosis, with sera from Brucella-infected mice along with negative sera and sera from mice which were inoculated with other Gram-negative species for assurance of specificity. Thereafter, cattle sera collected from different regions were assessed along with known negative and known positive serum samples. We found that Omp2b can discriminate between Brucella-infected animals and non-infected ones. Results for assessment of two hundred and fifty cattle sera by Omp2b-based indirect ELISA which were compared to Rose Bengal plate agglutination test (RBPT) and serum tube agglutination test (SAT) showed that our proposed procedure has the sensitivity of 88.5%, specificity of 100%, and accuracy of 90.8%. We suggest that recombinant Omp2b could be used as a protein antigen for diagnosis of brucellosis in domestic animals and can be evaluated for detection of human brucellosis. ? 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.",Brucella; diagnosis; ELISA; Omp2b; Recombinant protein,"bacterial antigen; bacterial protein; Omp2b protein, Brucella; porin; animal; Bagg albino mouse; bovine; Brucella abortus; brucellosis; cattle disease; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; genetics; human; immunology; isolation and purification; microbiology; mouse; procedures; serology; veterinary medicine; Animals; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Brucella abortus; Brucellosis; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Porins; Serologic Tests",2-s2.0-85069841652

Previous studies in this area are limited by self-reported data and small samples. In a large population-based cohort of parent–child dyads, we investigated how modification of pre-packaged snack food, i.e. (a) item quantity and variety, and (b) dishware (boxed container) size affected intake. Methods: Design: Randomized trial nested within the cross-sectional Child Health CheckPoint of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, clustered by day of visit. Sample: 1299 11–12 year olds, 1274 parents. Exposure: 2 × 2 manipulation of snack box container size and item quantity/variety: (1) small box, few items, (2) large box, few items, (3) small box, more items, (4) large box, more items. Procedure: Participants received a snack box during a 15 min break within their 3.5 h visit; any snacks remaining were weighed. Outcomes: Consumed quantity (grams) and energy intake (kilojoules). Analyses: Unadjusted linear regression. Results: Children who were offered a greater quantity and variety of snack items consumed considerably more energy and a slightly higher food mass (main effect for energy intake: 349 kJ, 95% CI 282–416, standardized mean difference (effect size) 0.66; main effect for mass: 10 g, 95% CI 3–17, effect size 0.17). In contrast, manipulating box size had little effect on child consumption, and neither box size nor quantity/variety of items consistently affected adults’ consumption. Conclusion: In children, reducing the number and variety of snack food items available may be a more fruitful intervention than focusing on container or dishware size. Effects observed among adults were small, although we could not exclude social desirability bias in adults aware of observation. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,adult; Article; Australian; caloric intake; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; fast food; female; food intake; food quantity; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; obesity; priority journal; school child,2-s2.0-85069533425

This study seeks to examine whether women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at increased risk of developing NAFLD compared to women without GDM. Methods: We conducted a population-based retrospective matched-controlled cohort study utilising The Health Improvement Network (THIN), a large primary care database representative of the United Kingdom population, between 01/01/1990 to 31/05/2016 followed by systematic review of available literature. The study population included 9640 women with GDM and 31,296 controls without GDM, matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and time of pregnancy. All study participants were free from NAFLD diagnosis at study entry. Patients with GDM and patients developing NAFLD were identified by clinical codes. Results: The median (range) follow-up duration was similar in women with and without GDM (2.95 (1.21–6.01) vs 2.85 (1.14–5.75) years respectively). Unadjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) for NAFLD development in women with vs without GDM was 3.28 (95% CI 2.14–5.02), which remained significant after adjustment for wide range of potential confounders (IRR 2.70; 95% CI 1.744–4.19). The risk of NAFLD in GDM remained high (IRR 2.46: 95% CI 1.51–4.00) despite women being censored after they developed type 2 diabetes. The meta-analysis of 3 studies (including the current study) showed increased NAFLD risk in women with vs without GDM (OR 2.60; 95% CI 1.90–3.57, I2 = 0%). As our study is based on routine clinical diagnosis of NAFLD, this study could potentially have underestimated the risk of NAFLD development. Conclusions: Women with GDM are at increased risk of developing NAFLD in their later life compared to women without GDM regardless of the development of type 2 diabetes. Clinicians should have a low threshold to investigate women with history of GDM for the presence of NAFLD. Further studies to identify screening strategies are needed. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",GDM; Meta-analysis; NAFLD; Population-based; THIN,antilipemic agent; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Article; body mass; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; follow up; human; hypothyroidism; incidence; intra-abdominal fat; liver transplantation; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; maternal obesity; medical history; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; ovary polycystic disease; population research; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; primary medical care; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; systematic review,2-s2.0-85069047254

While appropriate financial support can reduce the burden for family caregivers, little is known about the range and adequacy of financial support, welfare and benefits for family caregivers across countries with similarly developed health care systems. Aim: The aim is o identify and compare sources of financial support for family caregivers of people approaching the end of life, across six countries with similarly performing health care systems (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States). Design: A survey of financial support, welfare and benefits for end of life family caregivers was completed by 99 palliative care experts from the six countries. Grey literature searches and academic database searches were also conducted. Comparative analyses of all data sources documented financial support within and between each country. Results: Some form of financial support for family caregivers is available in all six countries; however the type, extent and reach of support vary. Financial support is administered by multiple agencies, eligibility criteria for receiving support are numerous and complex, and there is considerable inequity in the provision of support. Conclusion: Numerous barriers exist to the receipt of financial support, welfare and benefits. We identified several areas of concern, including a lack of clarity around eligibility, inconsistent implementation, complexity in process and limited support for working carers. Nonetheless, there is significant potential for policymakers to learn from other countries’ experiences, particularly with regard to the scope and operationalisation of financial support. ?

Methods: Disability among 2,850 injured participants, including 677 migrants to New Zealand, was measured prospectively using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Results: Migrants experienced higher risk of disability than non-migrants at three months post-injury (aRR=1.14, 95%CI 1.03–1.26). Both groups had similar disability prevalence, but higher than pre-injury, at 24 months. For migrants, strong predictors of disability at three months post-injury were: higher injury severity, pre-injury obesity, and perceiving the injury as a threat of disability. Having multiple chronic conditions was a predictor of disability at both time points. Conclusions: Disability was persistent for migrants and non-migrants to 24 months post-injury. The disability risk at three months was higher for migrants. Certain predictors associated with disability were identified. Implications for public health: Despite having accessed healthcare services for their injury, migrants (compared with non-migrants) had higher risks of disability at least in the first three months post-injury. Interventions should be focused during this critical period on identified key predictors to promote faster recovery and reduce disability. ? 2019 The Authors",disability; injury; migrants; outcomes,adult; disability; disabled person; ethnology; female; hospitalization; human; injury; injury scale; male; middle aged; migration; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; outcome assessment; prevalence; prospective study; psychology; quality of life; time factor; Adult; Disability Evaluation; Disabled Persons; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Time Factors; Transients and Migrants; Wounds and Injuries,2-s2.0-85068672272

Such studies have reported short-term stable or increasing BMD. We assessed whether this BMD stability persists for > 10?years in middle-aged and older men established on ART. Methods: A 12-year, prospective, longitudinal study in 44 HIV-infected men treated with ART who had measurements of BMD at the lumbar spine, proximal femur and total body at baseline, 2, 6 and 12?years. Results: At baseline, the mean age of participants was 49?years, the mean duration of HIV infection was 8?years, and the mean duration of ART was 50?months. After 12?years, BMD increased by 6.9% (95% CI 3.4 to 10.3) at the lumbar spine, and remained stable (range of BMD change: ? 0.6% to 0.0%) at the total hip, femoral neck and total body. Only two individuals had a decrease of > 10% in BMD at any site during follow-up and both decreases in BMD were explained by co-morbid illnesses. Conclusions: BMD remained stable over 12?years in middle-aged and older HIV-infected men treated with ART. Monitoring BMD in men established on ART who do not have risk factors for BMD loss is not necessary. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Body weight; Bone density; HIV; Osteopenia; Osteoporosis,antiretrovirus agent; bisphosphonic acid derivative; calcium; colecalciferol; efavirenz plus emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil; glucocorticoid; prednisone; tenofovir disoproxil; vitamin D; zoledronic acid; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; body weight; bone density; chronic obstructive lung disease; cigarette smoking; comorbidity; controlled study; disease course; drug megadose; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; femoral neck; follow up; fracture; fracture risk assessment; hip; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; longitudinal study; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; measurement; middle aged; osteomalacia; osteoporosis; patient monitoring; priority journal; prospective study; proximal femur; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; vitamin D deficiency,2-s2.0-85068175118

Results: We found dedicated memory clinics in the seven DHBs that have the largest older persons populations in New Zealand. Those DHBs that had discontinued their memory clinics did so because they opted for a more integrated approach using their primary care based dementia care pathway. Increased waiting times, low staffing ratios, variance in cognitive screening tests and patient demographics were reported.

Methods: This was a multicenter randomized crossover trial conducted in the Netherlands Cancer Institute, Erasmus Medical Center, and Maastricht University Medical Center in The Netherlands. The study included 46 laryngectomized subjects with prior heat and moisture exchanger (HME) and adhesive experience. Results: A significant improvement in the number of compliant individuals was found: Luna: n = 43 of 45 (96%); usual care: n = 35 of 46 (76%), P = 0.02. The Luna period was associated with longer intervals of daily HME use (Luna 23.2 hours [range: 15.6–24.0 hours], usual care [UC]: 21.5 hours [range: 6.0–24.0 hours], P = 0.003) and an increased frequency of skin improvement overnight (Luna 3.9 days [standard deviation (SD)]: 7.0 days), Usual Care: 8.1 days ([SD: 10.8 days], P = 0.008). Fifty-six percent (n = 26) of participants wanted to continue using the Provox Luna system at the conclusion of the study. Conclusion: An improvement in compliance and skin recovery overnight was observed when the Provox Luna was added to the usual adhesive and HME use. Therefore, there is utility in supplementing the usual post-total laryngectomy care with the Provox Luna system at night, particularly in the setting of compliance concerns and in subjects who desire dermatological relief overnight.

Aim: To evaluate decision support within a ‘real-world' shared decision-making model. Methods: A pragmatic comparative effectiveness randomised trial in the Positive Birth After Caesarean Clinic. Women with one previous caesarean and singleton pregnancy <25?weeks were randomly allocated to standard Positive Birth After Caesarean care, or standard Positive Birth After Caesarean care plus a decision aid booklet. Main outcome measure was mode of birth, with secondary measures of knowledge, decisional conflict, birth choice, adherence to birth choice, perception of decision support, and satisfaction. Results: Of 297 participants, rate of attempted vaginal birth after caesarean increased and was similar for both groups (61% vs 57%, P?=?0.5). Knowledge scores increased more for women in the additional decision aid group (2.0 vs 1.6 points, P?=?0.2). Decisional conflict score reduction was similar between groups (P?=?0.5). Women initially unsure of their birth preference who received the additional decision aid had greater reduction in decisional conflict score (P?=?0.04) and were more likely to plan vaginal birth after caesarean (49% vs 33%, P?=?0.2). Adherence to birth choice and birth satisfaction was similar between groups. Women in the additional decision aid group rated their decision support tool higher (P?<?0.01). Conclusions: In a ‘real world' shared decision-making model, an additional decision aid conferred some benefits in factors associated with preparation for shared decision-making.

Our results showed that an affiliation with Islam was associated with reduced risk for suicide ideation, however affiliating with Orthodox Christianity and no religion was related to increased risk for suicide ideation. While affiliating with Buddhism, Catholic religion and no religion was associated with lowered risk for attempting suicide, affiliation with Islam was related to heightened risk for attempting suicide. Affiliation with Hinduism, Orthodox Christianity, Catholicism, other religions and with no religion was associated with decreased risk for psychological distress but those reported affiliating with Islam evinced greater risk for psychological distress. The associations of the strength of religious belief to suicidal ideation and attempts were in the expected direction for most but had a positive relation in respondents affiliating with Catholicism and other religions. Students reporting affiliation with Islam, the Christian Orthodox religion and Buddhism were the least accepting of suicide but they displayed a more confronting interpersonal style to an imagined peer with a suicidal decision. It was concluded that the protective function of religion in educated segments of populations (university students) and in university students residing in Muslim countries where freedom from religion is restricted or religion is normative and/or compulsory is likely to be limited. Our findings suggest that public policies supporting religious freedom may augment the protective function of religion against suicide and psychological distress. ?

This study aims to investigate the effects of DM on CRT response and cardiovascular outcomes in Asian HF patients. Consecutive Asian HF patients receiving CRT were enrolled in the Prospective Evaluation of Asian with CRT for Heart Failure (PEACH) study from 2011 to 2017. CRT response and super-response were defined as decrease in end-systolic volume index ?15% and ?30%, respectively. Primary endpoint was time to composite of HF-hospitalization and all-cause mortality. Among 161 patients followed for 3.3 ± 1.5 years (age 66.7 ± 11.2 years, 22% females, mean QRS duration 154.3 ± 22.4 ms, 83% left bundle branch block), 84 (52%) were CRT responders and 57 (35%) were super-responders. Of 82 (51%) patients with DM (100% type 2, mean HbA1c 7.3 ± 1.9%), 35 (43%) were responders. DM attenuated reverse remodeling (CRT response: AOR 0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20 to 0.98, p < 0.05; super-response: AOR 0.42, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.97, p <0.05), and DM increased HF-hospitalization and all-cause mortality (AHR 1.68, 95% CI 1.00 to 2.82, p = 0.05). The extent of CRT-response correlates with higher event-free survival (CRT response: AHR 0.5, 95% CI 0.30 to 0.81, p = 0.005; super-response: AHR 0.27, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.52, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the extent of reverse remodeling post-CRT is the strongest predictor of event free survival. However, DM is detrimental to the CRT recipient by attenuating reverse remodeling, inducing end organ dysfunction and is independently associated with worsened clinical outcomes among Asian HF patients. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; enkephalinase inhibitor; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; spironolactone; sulfonylurea; adverse outcome; aged; all cause mortality; Article; Asian; cardiac resynchronization therapy; cardiovascular parameters; clinical outcome; clinical trial; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; end systolic volume index; event free survival; female; heart failure; heart left bundle branch block; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; QRS interval; reference value; sensitivity and specificity; treatment response,2-s2.0-85068930941

Whether maternal and neonatal outcomes differ between patients who concurrently presented with preeclampsia and those who did not, have not been fully investigated. Methods: A total number of 158 patients with placental abruption were included. Of them, 66 concurrently had preeclampsia. Maternal and neonatal characteristics including delivery weeks, time of onset and birthweight as well as the grade of placental abruption were collected and analysed. Results: The time at diagnosis of placental abruption in patients who concurrently presented preeclampsia was significantly earlier than that in patients who did not. The number of patients with grade III placental abruption was significantly higher in patients who concurrently presented with preeclampsia, compared to patients who did not. The odds ratio of an increase in grade III placental abruption in patients who concurrently presented preeclampsia was 5.27 (95%CL: 2.346, 12.41), compared to patients who did not. The numbers of infants who were born pre-term and the numbers of stillbirth/neonatal deaths as well as the number of fetal distress were significantly higher in patients who concurrently presented with preeclampsia, compared to patients who did not. The fetal birthweight was significantly lower in patients who concurrently presented with preeclampsia compared to patients who did not.

Methods: The studied population included European women and Asian women diagnosed with stage I–III breast cancer between June 2000 and May 2013 identified from the combined Waikato and Auckland Breast Cancer Registers. Characteristics and treatment were compared between Asian and European women. Kaplan–Meier method was used to examine the survival difference. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality. Results: The studied cohort included 8608 European and 949 Asian women. Asian women were younger, had less comorbidities and were less likely to be obese than European women. Asian women were more likely to have grade 3, larger and HER2+ breast cancers. Asian women were more likely to receive mastectomy, less likely to have reconstruction after mastectomy, less likely to have chemotherapy, less likely to be treated with trastuzumab if HER2+, and had better adherence to endocrine therapy (adjusted odds ratio: 1.54; 95% CI 1.22–1.93). Asian women had better cancer-specific survival and all-cause survival than European women. The adjusted HR of cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality were 0.64 (95% CI 0.49–0.82) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.55–0.84), respectively. Conclusions: Asian women are more likely to have high grade, larger and HER2+ breast cancers than European women. In spite of this, they had better breast cancer outcomes. Possible explanations include the differences in adherence to endocrine therapy, age, BMI and comorbidities. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Adherence to endocrine therapy; Asian women; Breast cancer; Ethnic disparity; Survival,trastuzumab; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; Asian; body mass; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cancer survival; comorbidity; European; female; hazard ratio; human; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; mastectomy; New Zealand; partial mastectomy; priority journal; proportional hazards model; very elderly; breast tumor; disease management; ethnology; follow up; health care survey; mortality; prognosis; register; treatment outcome; Breast Neoplasms; Disease Management; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Neoplasm Staging; New Zealand; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85067254108

As a pilot it offered opportunities to test interventions for reducing ethnic inequities in colorectal cancer screening prior to nationwide programme introduction. Small media interventions (e.g. educational material and DVDs) have been used at both community and participant level to improve uptake. We tested whether a DVD originally produced to raise community awareness among the M?ori population would have a positive impact on participation and reduce the proportion of incorrectly performed tests (spoiled kits) if mailed out with the usual reminder letter. Methods: The study was a parallel groups pseudo-randomised controlled trial. Over 12 months, all M?ori and Pacific ethnicity non-responders four weeks after being mailed the test kit were allocated on alternate weeks to be sent, or not, the DVD intervention with the usual reminder letter. The objective was to determine changes in participation and spoiled kit rates in each ethnic group, determined three months from the date the reminder letter was sent. Participants and those recording the outcomes (receipt of a spoiled or non-spoiled test kit) were blinded to group assignment. Results: 2333 M?ori and 2938 Pacific people participated (11 withdrew). Those who were sent the DVD (1029 M?ori and 1359 Pacific) were less likely to participate in screening than those who were not (1304 M?ori and 1579 Pacific). Screening participation was reduced by 12.3% (95% CI 9.1-15.5%) in M?ori (13.6% versus 25.9%) and 8.3% (95% CI 5.8-10.8%) in Pacific (10.1% versus 18.4%). However, spoiled kit rates (first return) were significantly higher among those not sent the DVD (33.1% versus 12.4% in M?ori and 42.1% versus 21.9% in Pacific). Conclusion: The DVD sent with the reminder letter to BSP non-responders reduced screening participation to an extent that more than offset the lower rate of spoiled kits.

The National Mental Health Commission has made a call for investment in mobile health services directed at prevention and early intervention to relieve the demand on targeted mental health services that are costly to provide. Parents and primary caregivers play a significant role in the lives of adolescents and are important targets for such efforts. Currently, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of programs delivered solely via text message for parents of adolescents. Objective: To evaluate the effects of a text-messaging program (MyTeen) on promoting parental competence and mental health literacy for parents of adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: A parallel 2-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in New Zealand. A total of 221 parents and primary caregivers of adolescents aged 10 to 15 years were recruited from March 19 to August 17, 2018, via community outreach and social media and were randomly allocated 1:1 into the control or the intervention group. Statistical analysis was performed on the principle of intention to treat with adjustment for baseline factors and ethnicity. Intervention: A text-messaging program for parents of adolescents (age 10-15 years) to promote parental competence and mental health literacy. Participants received 1 daily text message over 4 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Parental competence, assessed at 1 month after randomization by the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale. Results: In total, 221 participants (214 [96.8%] female) were randomized, 109 to the intervention group and 112 to the control group; 201 participants (91%) completed the trial at 3 months. Significant group difference was observed on the primary outcome at the end of 1 month of intervention, with participants reporting a higher level of parental competence than those in the control group (estimated mean difference, 3.33 points; 95% CI, 1.37-5.29 points; P?=?.002). Except for knowledge about mental health, all secondary outcomes were significant, including continued improvement in parental competence at 3 months (estimated mean difference, 4.08 points; 95% CI, 1.96-6.20 points; P?<?.001), knowledge of help seeking (estimated mean difference, 0.99 points; 95% CI, 0.49-1.50 points; P?<?.001), parental distress (estimated mean difference, -2.39 points; 95% CI, -4.37 to -0.40 points; P?=?.02), and parent-adolescent communication (estimated mean difference, 2.21 points; 95% CI, 0.48-3.95 points; P?=?.01), with participants in the intervention group reporting better parenting-related outcomes than the control group at 1 and 3 months after the intervention. Conclusions and Relevance: This text-messaging program for parents of adolescents appears to be an effective and feasible way to facilitate the implementation and delivery of evidence-based information to populations that are not easily reached with other intervention modalities. The program can be easily scaled up for delivery as an early preventive intervention and may represent a less expensive option for service delivery.

Aim: To compare the rates of later schizophrenia between age-matched mental health service users with initial diagnoses as alcohol abusers or illicit drug users. Method: From the PRIMHD comprehensive national database, all users of the mental health services over a 5-year period who received an ICD-10 presenting diagnosis of alcohol or substance use/abuse were identified. For each person identified, the database was examined for the following 3 years to determine the numbers later diagnosed with schizophrenia. Results: For the initial alcohol problem people in their twenties, 1.7% were diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia in the subsequent 3 years. For the initial drug problem people, the rate was 10.9%. Within that drug-using population, the indigenous Maori developed schizophrenia at a higher rate than did the remainder of the population.

Nineteen focus groups were conducted to explore the relative influence of factors contributing to body weight in children. Predetermined and participant-suggested factors were ranked. Discussion data were inductively analysed. The cost of healthy foods was the highest ranked factor across all groups. Ranked similarly were ease of access to takeaways and lack of time for food preparation. Cultural factors followed by screen time induced sedentariness in children and lack of time to ensure children exercised was next. Participant-raised factors included lack of familial, social, and health promotion support, and others’ behaviour and attitudes negatively impacting what children ate. All groups rejected stereotyping that blamed culture for higher obesity rates. Compared to the M?ori and NZ European groups, the Pacific Island and Indian participants spoke of losing culture, missing extended family support, and not having access to culturally appropriate nutrition education or social support and services.

Decreased cardiac function can reduce intestinal perfusion, resulting in morphological alterations, which may contribute to changes in the gut microbiota composition in patients with heart failure (HF). In this regard, a germane question is whether changes in gut microbiota composition are a cause or consequence of the cardiovascular disturbance. We tested the hypothesis that the development of HF, after myocardial infarction, would cause gut dysbiosis. Fecal samples were collected before and 6 wk after myocardial infarction or sham surgery. Gut microbiota were characterized by sequencing the bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA. The composition of bacterial communities in the fecal samples was evaluated by calculating three major ecological parameters: 1) the Chao 1 richness, 2) the Pielou evenness, and 3) the Shannon index. None of these indices was changed in either sham or HF rats. The Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio was not altered in HF rats. The number of species in each phylum was also not different between sham and HF rats. β-Diversity analysis showed that the composition of gut microbiota was not changed with the development of HF. Bacterial genera were grouped according to their major metabolic end-products (acetate, butyrate, and lactate), but no differences were observed in HF rats. Therefore, we conclude that HF induced by myocardial infarction does not affect gut microbiota composition, at least in rats, indicating that the dysbiosis observed in patients with HF may precede cardiovascular disturbance.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our study demonstrated that, following myocardial infarction in rats, heart failure (HF) development did not affect the intestinal microbiota despite distinct differences reported in the gut microbiota of humans with HF. Our finding is consistent with the notion that dysbiosis observed in patients with HF may precede cardiovascular dysfunction and therefore offers potential for early diagnosis and treatment.",cardiovascular diseases; gut dysbiosis; gut microbiome; gut-heart interactions; heart dysfunction,,2-s2.0-85071710484

However, they have a complex array of limitations, particularly associated with the duration of protection against clinical disease and imperfect immunity (carriage and transmission). Little is known about risk factors for pertussis vaccination failure. Understanding pertussis vaccination failure risk is most important in the paediatric population. This study aims to investigate risk factors for pertussis vaccination failure in (1) infants between birth and six weeks of age born to mothers who received pertussis booster vaccinations during pregnancy and (2) infants after the completion of the primary series (approximately five months old) to four years old. This will be achieved in a two-step process for each study group. Pertussis vaccination failure cases will first be described using a case series study design, relevant case characteristics will be sourced from six national administrative datasets. The case series study results will help select candidate risk factors (hypothesis generating step) to be tested in the retrospective cohort study (hypothesis testing step. Pattern analysis will be used to investigate risk factor patterns in the cohort study. The identification of higher risk groups enables targeting strategies, such as additional doses, to better prevent pertussis disease. ? 2019 by the authors.

A significant limitation of vitreous humor is the potential effect of prolonged immersion. A recent animal study and case report suggested that cerebrospinal fluid biochemistry may be an alternative to vitreous because it is more resistant to the effects of immersion, given its protected anatomical location. This study compared postmortem cerebrospinal fluid sodium and chloride (PMCSC) levels collected via ventricular aspiration (PMCSC_V) and via lumbar puncture (PMCSC_L) in 13 SWD and 31 nonimmersion deaths. It showed a significant elevation in PMCSC levels in SWD deaths for both PMCSC_V and PMCSC_L (P < 0.05). The areas under the curve on the receiver operating characteristic curves for PMCSC_V and PMCSC_L were 0.73 and 0.83, respectively. The optimal cutoff for PMCSC_V was 216 mmol/L (sensitivity, 0.60; specificity, 0.72; likelihood ratio, 1.80; positive predictive value, 0.45) and for PMCSC_L was 241 mmol/L (sensitivity, 0.78; specificity, 0.73; likelihood ratio, 2.89; positive predictive value, 0.46). This study supports PMCSC levels as another biochemical test that can potentially aid in the diagnosis of SWD, particularly in cases where vitreous humor samples are unavailable or uninterpretable. ?

These cancers are associated with shorter progression-free survival, Gleason scores ? 7, and an immunosuppressive environment defined by a higher proportion of PD-1, PD-L1 and colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) positive cells. Consistent with this, RNA-seq of tumours showed enrichment for pathways associated with immune signalling and cell migration. We further show a role for hypoxia and wild-type p53 in upregulating Δ133TP53 levels. Finally, AUC analysis showed that Δ133TP53β expression level alone predicted aggressive disease with 88% accuracy.

However, whether infant sleep duration affects body composition trajectories and cardiovascular health through to mid-adolescence remains unknown. Methods: Participants were 336 adolescents from a community-based prospective birth cohort in Melbourne, Australia. Mothers completed 24-hour time diaries, including infant sleep in 5-minute intervals at ages 2, 4, and 12 months. BMI and body composition outcomes were measured 6-monthly between 4 and 6.5 years and at 10 and 14 years. Cardiovascular outcomes at 14 years comprised blood pressure, pulse wave velocity, retinal arteriole-to-venule ratio, and carotid intima-media thickness. We used multivariable linear regression and multinomial logistic regression analyses adjusted for sex, age, BMI at birth, gestational age, ethnicity, maternal education, maternal BMI, and neighborhood socioeconomic position. Results: At 2 months, infants slept on average 14.1 hours [standard deviation (SD) 1.9], decreasing to 13.4 hours (SD 2.0) by 12 months. We observed no associations between the different sleep duration time points in infancy and later BMI or body composition. Moreover, a shorter sleep duration did not increase the odds of being on a high body composition trajectory compared with longer sleep (e.g., odds ratio per hour of sleep at 4 months is 0.85, 95% confidence interval 0.65-1.11). Infant sleep duration was also not associated with cardiovascular function or large or small artery structure at 14 years of age. Conclusions: We found no evidence that sleep duration very early in life affects adolescent body composition or cardiovascular health. ?

While there is growing optimism for better outcomes with screening using annual computed tomography, the impact of co-existing airflow limitation on survival remains unknown. To compare survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing surgery stratified according to the presence or absence of pre-surgery airflow limitation. Materials and Methods: We undertook a systematic literature search of non-screen lung cancer that encompassed studies reported between January 1946 and January 2017. Full-text articles were identified following eligibility scoring, with data extracted and analysed using a standardised analytical method (PRISMA). The results of this systematic review in non-screen lung cancers were compared to real-world results from a lung cancer screening cohort (N = 10,054), where outcomes following surgery could be compared after stratification according to pre-surgery airflow limitation. Results: In the systematic review, 6899 subjects were included from 10 studies; 7 were retrospective, 3 were prospective. Overall survival was 950 (44%) in 2144 people with COPD and 2597 (55%) from 4755 controls (unadjusted P value &lt;0.001). However, the overall meta-analysed random effects odds ratio for overall survival (N = 10) and 5-year survival (N = 4) comparing those with and without COPD was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.84–1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI = 0.79–1.24) respectively. There were no signs of significant heterogeneity (I2 = 19.1%, P = 0.27) nor publication bias as assessed by funnel plot and Egger's test (P = 0.19). In the lung cancer screening sub-study of 10,054 screening participants we found no difference in 5-year survival in those with and without airflow limitation (84% and 81% respectively, P = 0.64). Conclusion: Survival after surgery for non-small cell lung cancer is comparable between those with and without spirometry evidence of airflow limitation. This finding was replicated in lung cancer diagnosed during screening. ? 2019",COPD; Lung cancer; Surgery; Survival,airflow; Article; cancer mortality; cancer screening; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chronic obstructive lung disease; disease severity; early cancer; human; lung function; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; prevalence; priority journal; spirometry; survival rate; systematic review,2-s2.0-85069712422

They undergo extensive metabolism and their phenolic acid metabolites are likely to be the mediators of bioactivity. The effect of blueberry-derived phenolic acids on one aspect of inflammation, monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, is investigated. Methods and results: The major blueberry-derived phenolic acids in human plasma are identified and quantified. Three test mixtures representing compounds present at 0–4 h (Early), 4–24 h (Late), or 0–24 h (Whole) are used to investigate the effect on adhesion of monocytes to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)–activated endothelial cells. The Late mixture reduces monocyte adhesion, but there is no effect of the Early or Whole mixtures. Exclusion of syringic acid from each mixture results in inhibition of monocyte adhesion. Exposure to the phenolic acid mixtures has no effect on the endothelial surface expression of adhesion molecules intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), or E-selectin, suggesting that other molecular mechanisms are responsible for the observed effect. Conclusion: This study shows that physiological concentrations of blueberry polyphenol metabolites can help maintain cardiovascular health by regulating monocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The purpose of this exercise is for visitors to observe and review a host’s practice in a non-punitive manner and provide them with constructive feedback as required; ultimately to improve practice quality and patient care. Methods: A rapid review of three biomedical databases was conducted to identify relevant literature published up until 9 April 2018. There were no limits placed on publication date or publication type. Two authors were responsible for study selection and data extraction using a priori inclusion criteria and extraction templates. Study details and key findings were reported narratively and in tables. Results: A total of nine publications, reporting outcomes for eight study groups, were identified as eligible for inclusion in this rapid review. Of these eight, six were observational studies, one was a longitudinal study and one was a randomized controlled trial. Practice visits were considered useful in identifying areas of improvement in professional practice; however, the rate at which these improvements were elicited varied greatly between the included studies. Overall, both hosts and visitors gained insight from the practice visit process and in general their experiences were positive.

The 3-dimensional protein structure of YB-1 has yet to be determined and its role in transcriptional regulation remains elusive. Drug targeting of transcription factors is often thought to be difficult and there are very few published high-throughput screening approaches. YB-1 predominantly binds to single-stranded nucleic acids, adding further difficulty to drug discovery. Therefore, we have developed two novel screening assays to detect compounds that interfere with the transcriptional activation properties of YB-1, both of which may be generalizable to screen for inhibitors of other nucleic acid binding molecules. The first approach is a cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay that measures the level of activation of a fragment of the E2F1 promoter by YB-1. The second approach is a novel application of the AlphaScreen system, to detect interference of YB-1 interaction with a single-stranded DNA binding site. These complementary assays examine YB-1 binding to two discrete nucleic acid sequences using two different luminescent signal outputs and were employed sequentially to screen 7360 small molecule compounds leading to the identification of three putative YB-1 inhibitors. ? 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences",AlphaScreen; Cancer; Luciferase; Single-stranded DNA; Transcription factor; YB-1,jk 0395b 007; protein inhibitor; rus 0016b 003; rus 0020d 011; rus 0028g 002; rus 0116g 009; rus 0116h 006; rus 0202g 005; rus 0207a 006; rus0rus 0202g 005; transcription factor E2F1; unclassified drug; Y box binding protein 1; A-375 cell line; Article; cell adhesion; cell counting; competitive inhibition; controlled study; DNA content; electrophilicity; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; luciferase assay; luminescence; MDA-MB-231 cell line; nucleotide sequence; orthogonal assay; pH; promoter region; protein determination; protein DNA interaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reporter gene; transcription initiation,2-s2.0-85060333448

Here we summarise a recent literature review that was conducted to identify and examine key factors that influence immunisation coverage, timeliness of vaccinations and the core drivers that affect vaccine uptake. We conclude that well designed systems, taking a holistic approach with multiple components, gain broader community acceptance and trust; early and continual engagement with well-informed healthcare professionals builds trust and improves uptake; the family's experience during vaccination events is important; community-led vaccine advocacy is required to target specific populations to help to promote and improve access to immunisation.

Since 2012 the New Zealand public health sector has achieved 90% CVD risk assessment (CVDRA) for each eligible person across New Zealand using a modified version of an overseas risk equation, through incentivising Primary Health Organisation (PHO) performance. In 2018 the New Zealand Ministry of Health endorsed the use of a suite of four new CVDRA equations which were developed using the large NZ Predict cohort (500,000 people). These equations more accurately reflect an individual's CVD risk and incorporate both traditional CVD risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes, but also sociodemographic factors including ethnicity and a deprivation score. The new CVDRA equations are an important tool to address the major inequities in CVD incidence, prevalence and mortality in Aotearoa-New Zealand. However, while the new equations provide more accurate assessment of risk, they are more complicated and therefore more prone to error if not properly validated and systematically implemented. To take advantage of this important opportunity to address equity in heart health we need strategic vision and national leadership. In this paper we make the case that to most safely and cost effectively implement the new equations, the Ministry of Health (MOH) should support a unified national CVD risk generator. A single, electronic, national CVD risk generator would: a) ensure national consistency and quality control-a single set of validated and current equations would be available to both clinicians and patients; b) avoid substantial replication of effort and cost in both developing and validating multiple calculators; c) enable central collection of the encrypted dataset required to develop more accurate risk assessment equations in population subgroups, both now and in the future, as CVD risk evolves; d) provide a platform to facilitate systematic and consistent national CVD risk communication and management; and e) facilitate ease of updating the tool and practice in the future as changes to the algorithm are agreed.",,"adult; aged; cardiovascular disease; clinical decision support system; health equity; human; middle aged; New Zealand; primary health care; procedures; risk assessment; socioeconomics; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Health Equity; Humans; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Primary Health Care; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors",2-s2.0-85071559406

We aimed to investigate accelerometer-assessed physical activity and sedentary time in cancer survivors, and describe activity profiles. Additionally, we identify demographic and clinical correlates of physical activity, sedentary time and activity profiles. Methods: Accelerometer, questionnaire and clinical data from eight studies conducted in four countries (n = 1447) were pooled. We calculated sedentary time and time spent in physical activity at various intensities using Freedson cut-points. We used latent profile analysis to identify activity profiles, and multilevel linear regression analyses to identify demographic and clinical variables associated with accelerometer-assessed moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA), sedentary time, the highly active and highly sedentary profile, adjusting for confounders identified using a directed acyclic graph. Results: Participants spent on average 26 min (3%) in MVPA and 568 min (66%) sedentary per day. We identified six activity profiles. Older participants, smokers and participants with obesity had significantly lower MVPA and higher sedentary time. Furthermore, men had significantly higher MVPA and sedentary time than women and participants who reported less fatigue had higher MVPA time. The highly active profile included survivors with high education level and normal body mass index. Haematological cancer survivors were less likely to have a highly active profile compared to breast cancer survivors. The highly sedentary profile included older participants, males, participants who were not married, obese, smokers, and those < 12 months after diagnosis. Conclusions: Cancer survivors engage in few minutes of MVPA and spend a large proportion of their day sedentary. Correlates of MVPA, sedentary time and activity profiles can be used to identify cancer survivors at risk for a sedentary and inactive lifestyle. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Activity profiles; Cancer survivors; Physical activity; Profile analysis; Sedentary time,academic achievement; adult; aged; Article; body mass; breast cancer; cancer survivor; clinical study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; fatigue; female; hematologic malignancy; human; major clinical study; male; married person; obesity; physical activity; physical inactivity; questionnaire; risk assessment; sedentary lifestyle; sedentary time; sex difference; smoking; accelerometry; activity tracker; cancer survivor; cohort analysis; exercise; Accelerometry; Cancer Survivors; Cohort Studies; Exercise; Female; Fitness Trackers; Humans; Male; Sedentary Behavior,2-s2.0-85070905441

In 6156 diverse children in the Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal study, the presence of 12 risk factors, spanning maternal health, social status, and home and neighborhood environment, defined CR and were assessed at last trimester and 9?months and 2?years of age.

Previous research has reported reduced hippocampal volume and decreased fractional anisotropy in carriers of the Met allele across a range of white matter tracts, including those networks that may support recognition memory. Here, in a sample of 61 healthy young adults, we used a source memory task to measure accuracy on each recognition subprocess, in order to determine whether the Val66Met SNP (rs6265) influences these equally. Additionally, we compared grey matter volume between these groups for structures that underpin familiarity and recollection separately. Finally, we used probabilistic tractography to reconstruct tracts that subserve each of these two recognition systems. Behaviourally, we found group differences on the familiarity measure, but not on recollection. However, we did not find any group difference on grey- or white-matter structures. Together, these results suggest a functional influence of the Val66Met SNP that is independent of coarse structural changes, and nuance previous research highlighting the relationship between BDNF, brain structure, and behaviour. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Diffusion tensor imaging; Dual-process; Neurotrophic factor; rs6265; Source memory; Structural magnetic resonance imaging,"brain derived growth factor; BDNF protein, human; brain derived neurotrophic factor; adult; Article; behavior assessment; brain function; diffusion weighted imaging; echo planar imaging; female; gene amplification; gene frequency; genotype; gray matter; human; human experiment; image analysis; image processing; male; memory assessment; normal human; priority journal; recognition; single nucleotide polymorphism; task performance; tissue structure; tractography; visual stimulation; voxel based morphometry; white matter; young adult; adolescent; anatomy and histology; brain; diffusion tensor imaging; genetics; genotype; gray matter; physiology; white matter; Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Genotype; Gray Matter; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Recognition, Psychology; White Matter; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85064587499

There remains significant diversity on approaches to cultural competency training and assessment. Little evidence exists about whether existing cultural competency training leads to improved patient health outcomes and reductions in health disparity. Discussion: In this paper I frame cultural competency as analogous to the ocean and consisting of three zones: surface competency zone, bias twilight zone, and the confronting midnight zone. The surface competency zone focuses on deployment of culturally-specific knowledge: what people see, say, and do. The bias twilight zone is where people engage in critical reflection on their inherent/unconscious biases, and how such biases inform their thoughts and practices. The confronting midnight zone is where people engage in critical consciousness and self-awareness. Here they look beyond their biases to interrogate their power and positionality in society (their own privileges and centralisation). This attention is coupled with a commitment to social justice and to working within their means to reduce health disparities. Conclusions: I suggest surface cultural competency is somewhat easier to see, teach and reach than the bias twilight or confronting midnight zones. But it is these deeper zones that cultural competency training needs to attend to if we are to see systemic cultural changes in healthcare provision. Research assessing the extent by which cultural competency training within each zone informs improved patient outcomes and reductions in health disparity is called for. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Assessment; Cultural competence; Cultural safety; Culture; Education; Teaching,"awareness; centralization; consciousness; cultural competence; cultural safety; ego development; health disparity; human; human experiment; review; sea; social justice; teaching; cultural competence; education; health care disparity; health care personnel; health care quality; health personnel attitude; medical education; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cultural Competency; Education, Medical, Continuing; Health Personnel; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Quality of Health Care",2-s2.0-85070780689

Despite this, it does not receive the same attention as other chronic pulmonary conditions in children such as cystic fibrosis. We measured health resource use and health-related quality of life over a 12-month period in children with bronchiectasis. Methods: We undertook a prospective cohort study of 85 children aged < 18-years with high-resolution chest computed-tomography confirmed bronchiectasis undergoing management in three pediatric respiratory medical clinics in Darwin and Brisbane, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. Children with cystic fibrosis or receiving cancer treatment were excluded. Data collected included the frequency of healthcare attendances (general practice, specialists, hospital and/or emergency departments, and other), medication use, work and school/childcare absences for parents/carers and children respectively, and both parent/carer and child reported quality of life and cough severity. Results: Overall, 951 child-months of observation were completed for 85 children (median age 8.7-years, interquartile range 5.4-11.3). The mean (standard deviation) number of exacerbations was 3.3 (2.2) per child-year. Thirty of 264 (11.4%) exacerbation episodes required hospitalization. Healthcare attendance and antibiotic use rates were high (30 and 50 per 100 child-months of observation respectively). A carer took leave from work for 53/236 (22.5%) routine clinic visits. Absences from school/childcare due to bronchiectasis were 24.9 children per 100 child-months. Quality of life scores for both the parent/carer and child were highly-correlated with one another, remained stable over time and were negatively associated with cough severity. Conclusions: Health resource use in this cohort of children is high, reflecting their severe disease burden.

Results: Promoter hypermethylation and gene body hypomethylation of EBF3 were observed in a number of metastatic tumour types, when compared to normal or primary tumour tissues, as well as in tumour vs normal tissues and in a colorectal primary/metastasis pair, although not all tumour samples or primary/metastasis cancer pairs exhibited altered patterns of EBF3 methylation. In addition, hypomethylation of TBC1D16 was observed in multiple tumours, including a breast cancer primary/metastasis pair, and to a lesser degree in melanoma, although again not all tumours or cancer primary/metastasis pairs exhibited altered patterns of methylation. Conclusions: These findings suggest characteristic DNA methylation changes in EBF3 and TBC1D16 are relatively common tumour-associated epigenetic events in multiple tumour types, which is consistent with a potential role as more general drivers of tumour progression. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cancer; DNA methylation; Gene body; Metastasis; Promoter,Article; breast cancer; clinical feature; colorectal cancer; CpG island; DNA methylation; EBF3 gene; endometrium cancer; epigenetics; gene; gene sequence; genetic association; genome; human; melanoma; metastasis; multiple cancer; primary tumor; priority journal; promoter region; prostate cancer; risk factor; TBC1D16 gene; tumor growth,2-s2.0-85070374707

Areas covered: In this review, we outline how outcomes in lung cancer screening are significantly affected by the presence of airflow limitation, as caused by COPD, and how this might impact the assessment of eligible smokers in a lung cancer screening clinic. Expert opinion: There is growing evidence showing that CT-based screening for lung cancer reduces lung cancer mortality. The benefits of screening exceed those seen in the NLST when screening is carried out in lower risk populations, for a longer duration, and when outcomes are compared with usual care control cohorts. In this article, we review data from a post-hoc analysis of the NLST. We suggest that whilst worsened airflow limitation is associated with greater lung cancer risk, there is also more aggressive lung cancer, reduced lung cancer operability, and for advanced COPD, reduced benefits from screening. We advocate an ’outcomes-based’ approach to screening over a ‘risk-based’ approach. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; comorbidity; competing risk; computed tomography; Lung cancer; operability; screening; shared-decision making,biological marker; airflow; cancer risk; cancer screening; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; human; lung cancer; Review; shared decision making; smoking; x-ray computed tomography,2-s2.0-85070454205

The so-called universal orientation of the health system, along with a strong commitment to social service provision, have contributed to New Zealand's favourable health statistics. However, despite a long-standing commitment to reducing health inequities, problems with access to care persist and the system is not delivering the promise of equitable health outcomes for all population groups. Primary health services and hospital-based services have developed largely independently, and major restructuring during the 1990s did not produce the expected efficiency gains. A focus on individual-level secondary services and performance targets has been prioritised over tackling issues such as suicide, obesity, and poverty-related diseases through community-based health promotion, preventive activities, and primary care. Future changes need to focus on strengthening the culture and capacity of the system to improve equity of outcomes, including expanding M?ori health service provision, integrating existing services and structures with new ones, aligning resources with need to achieve pro-equity outcomes, and strengthening population-based approaches to tackling contemporary drivers of health status. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"accident; child care; funding; health care; health care disparity; health insurance; health personnel attitude; human; New Zealand; non profit organization; pharmaceutical care; primary health care; priority journal; Review; secondary health care; economics; financial management; government; health care delivery; New Zealand; organization and management; public health; statistics and numerical data; Financing, Government; Government Programs; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; National Health Programs; New Zealand; Universal Health Insurance",2-s2.0-85069900696

A zebrafish xenograft is created by implanting mammalian tumor cells into the perivitelline space of two days-post-fertilization zebrafish embryos, followed by measuring the extent of the angiogenic response observed at an experimental endpoint up to two days post-implantation. The key advantage to this method is the ability to accurately quantitate the zebrafish host angiogenic response to the graft. This enables detailed examination of the molecular mechanisms as well as the host vs tumor contribution to the angiogenic response. The xenografted embryos can be subjected to a variety of treatments, such as incubation with potential anti-angiogenesis drugs, in order to investigate strategies to inhibit tumor angiogenesis. The angiogenic response can also be live-imaged in order to examine more dynamic cellular processes. The relatively undemanding experimental technique, cheap maintenance costs of zebrafish and short experimental timeline make this model especially useful for the development of strategies to manipulate tumor angiogenesis. ? 2019 Journal of Visualized Experiments.",Angiogenesis; Cancer; Cancer Research; Issue 150; Tumor; Vascular; Xenograft; Zebrafish,,2-s2.0-85071758383

Design Meta-analysis of randomised trials using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and RevMan software version 5·2 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen). Data sources MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Google and Science Direct databases alongside reference lists of appropriate articles and meta-analyses. Eligibility criteria Randomised studies published in English-language journals from 1980 to June 2018 that assessed lifestyle compared with control interventions on weight loss and that included ?100 subjects and reported weight change and mortality for ?1 year. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled using the generic inverse-variance method and expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CI and OR with 95% CI as appropriate. Heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I 2 statistic). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation score was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Results 31 randomised trials with a total of 20 816 overweight or obese participants were included. 70% of participants had cardiometabolic risk factors. Body weight was lower for lifestyle intervention compared with the control at 1 year (3.63 kg, 95% CI 2.58 to 4.67) and at 3 years (2.45 kg, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.73).

In all studies, there were 593 deaths (?0.3%/year). The ORs for mortality for weight loss interventions compared with the controls was 0.86 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.02), p=0.09. Conclusion In predominantly healthy populations with risk factors, there is a dose response with number of lifestyle interventions and weight loss. Frequent and sustained interventions are needed to achieve a clinically significant 5% weight loss. There was insufficient evidence to reliably evaluate the benefits in persons with known cardiovascular disease or cancer. ? 2019 Author(s).",lifestyle interventions; nutrition & dietetics; weight loss,all cause mortality; Article; body weight; body weight loss; cardiometabolic risk; human; lifestyle; meta analysis; obese patient; obesity; randomized controlled trial (topic),2-s2.0-85071120034

There remains an ongoing debate about the safety, benefits, and appropriate clinical scenarios for which each technique is employed. The aim of this study was to provide a panel of expert opinion on the role of each surgical technique currently available in the management of rectal cancer using a modified Delphi method. Methods: Surveys were designed to explore the key patient- and tumor-related factors including clinical scenarios for determining a surgeon’s choice of surgical technique. Results: Open surgery was favoured in obese patients with an extra-peritoneal tumor and a positive circumferential resection margin (CRM) or T4 tumor when a restorative resection was planned. Laparoscopy was favoured in non-obese males and females, in both intra- and extra-peritoneal tumors with a clear CRM. Robotic surgery was most commonly offered to obese patients when the CRM was clear and if an abdominoperineal resection was planned. Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) was preferred in male patients with a mid or low rectal cancer, particularly when obese. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery/transanal minimally invasive surgery local excision was only offered to frail patients with small, early stage tumors. Conclusions: All surgical techniques for rectal cancer dissection have a role and may be considered appropriate. Some techniques have advantages over others in certain clinical situations, and the best outcomes may be achieved by considering all options before applying an individualised approach to each clinical situation. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Clinical decision-making; Delphi technique; Procedures and techniques’ utilization; Rectal neoplasms,,2-s2.0-85070975753

Work in animal models has shown that maternal undernutrition (UN) during pregnancy leads to hypertension in adult offspring, with effects thought to be mediated in part via altered renal function. We have previously shown that growth hormone (GH) treatment of UN offspring during the pre-weaning period can prevent the later development of cardiometabolic disorders. However, the mechanistic basis for these observations is not well defined. The present study examined the impact of GH treatment on renal inflammatory markers in adult male offspring as a potential mediator of these reversal effects. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a chow diet fed ad libitum (CON) or at 50% of CON intake (UN) during pregnancy. All dams were fed the chow diet ad libitum during lactation. CON and UN pups received saline (CON-S/UN-S) or GH (2.5 μg/g/day; CON-GH/UN-GH) from postnatal day 3 until weaning (p21). Post-weaning males were fed a standard chow diet for the remainder of the study (150 days). Histological analysis was performed to examine renal morphological characteristics, and gene expression of inflammatory and vascular markers were assessed. There was evidence of renal hypotrophy and reduced nephron number in the UN-S group. Tumour necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecular-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 gene expression was increased in UN-S offspring and normalized in the UN-GH group. These findings indicate that pre-weaning GH treatment has the potential to normalize some of the adverse renal and cardiovascular sequelae that arise as a consequence of poor maternal nutrition. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.",cardiovascular disease; developmental programming; hypertension; maternal undernutrition; renal inflammation,,2-s2.0-85069868040

Automatic detection of everyday stress is a challenging problem, however, as both stress perception and stress manifestation notably vary between individuals. Therefore stress detectors, trained on data of each person separately, usually achieve notably higher accuracies than non-personalised ones. Unfortunately, this accuracy gain requires collecting too large sets of labelled training data to realistically obtain from end users. In addition, the majority of current stress detectors exploit physiological or mobile phone data: the latter approach increases battery consumption compare with normal phone use, and the former requires to wear additional devices and to charge their batteries. Unlike previous work, this work proposes genuinely unobtrusive personalised stress detection system, based on use of environmental sensors and unsupervised training of hidden Markov models (HMM) classifier and hence requiring neither sensor maintenance nor data labelling efforts from end users. In the experiments with real life behavioural data of office workers, collected during 10 months, the proposed system achieved 67% accuracy of classifying each day as stressful vs. normal and 95% accuracy in classifying months, thanks to discovery of novel characteristics of motion trajectories, indicative of stress. ? 2019",,Electric batteries; Health risks; Hidden Markov models; Motion analysis; Office buildings; Risk assessment; Telephone sets; Automatic Detection; Battery consumption; Environmental sensor; Mobile phone datum; Motion trajectories; Stress detection; Stress perception; Unsupervised training; Occupational risks,2-s2.0-85068204359

Following on from these observations, we hypothesized the existence of a common risk basis between LAM and breast cancer, and suggested increased risk of breast cancer among LAM patients. Here, by studying two additional LAM cohorts with more detailed epidemiological, life-style, and disease-related data, we show consistent results; a potential excess of estrogen-receptor-positive young breast cancer cases in LAM.

This study aimed to develop an optimised protocol for breath collection in sheep and compare 13C-methionine and methyl-13C-methionine as substrates for future breath test applications in ruminants. Two doses (1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg) of 13C-methionine or methyl-13C-methionine in saline were administered via intravenous injection to four South Australian Merino ewes aged three years with an average body weight of 65 kg. Exhaled breath samples were collected at baseline and every 10 min for 180 min after administration of the 13C-labelled substrate, and analysed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Dose recovery of 13CO2 derived from 13C-methionine was higher at each time-point compared to that derived from methyl-13C-methionine, at both concentrations. 13C-methionine dose evaluation indicated that intra-individual and inter-individual variability of percentage dose recovery was lower in animals dosed with 2 mg/kg 13C-methionine compared to 1 mg/kg 13C-methionine. Mean cumulative percentage dose recovery of animals administered 1 mg/kg and 2 mg/kg 13C-methionine at 60 min, 120 min and 180 min was 5.34 ± 0.87%, 11.52 ± 1.29% and 16.30 ± 1.45%, and 12.30 ± 0.34%, 25.12 ± 0.59% and 34.45 ± 0.57%, respectively. We conclude that the 13C-labelled methionine breath test can be reliably performed in sheep through intravenous administration of 2 mg/kg 13C-methionine. This study also demonstrated the utility and advantage of 13C-methionine compared to methyl-13C-methionine as substrates for future breath testing applications to evaluate hepatic mitochondrial function in sheep and other ruminants. Further development of the test could be employed to evaluate disease progression and efficacy of applied therapeutics in sheep models of human diseases characterised by hepatic dysfunction. In addition, the 13C-methionine breath test could be utilised in animal production to assess hepatic metabolic function and the potential impact of nutritional mismanagement. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",13C-methionine; Breath test; Isotope-ratio mass spectrometry; Liver; Metabolism; Sheep,,2-s2.0-85066135784

The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration committee rejected reclassifying a range of oral contraceptive pills (OCPs) from prescription to pharmacist-only medicines in 2015, mainly based on safety concerns. Improving access to OCPs may encourage some women to use contraceptives or switch from other contraceptive methods. However, some adverse events may increase and some women may stop using condoms, increasing their risk of sexually transmitted infections. This study aimed to estimate the cost effectiveness of reclassifying OCPs from prescription to pharmacist-only. Perspective: Healthcare system. Setting: Australian primary care. Methods: A Markov model was used to synthesise data from a variety of sources. The model included all Australian women aged 15–49?years (N = 5,644,701). The time horizon was 35?years. Contraceptive use before reclassification was estimated using data from the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, while survey data informed use after reclassification. Health outcomes included pregnancies, pregnancy outcomes (live birth, miscarriage, stillbirth, ectopic pregnancy and abortion), sexually transmitted infections, adverse events (venous thromboembolism, depression, myocardial infarction and stroke), ovarian cancer cases and quality-adjusted life-years. Costs included those related to general practitioner and specialist consultations, contraceptives and other medicines, pharmacist time, hospitalisations and adverse events. All costs were reported in 2016 Australian Dollars. A 5% discount rate was applied to health outcomes and costs. Results: Reclassifying OCPs resulted in 85.70?million quality-adjusted life-years experienced and costs of $46,910.14?million over 35?years, vs. 85.68?million quality-adjusted life-years experienced and costs of $50,274.95?million with OCPs remaining prescription-only. Thus, reclassifying OCPs was more effective and cost saving. However, a sensitivity analysis found that more research on the probability of pregnancy in women not using contraception and not trying to conceive is needed. Conclusion: Reclassifying OCPs is likely to be considered cost effective by Australian decision makers. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,non prescription drug; oral contraceptive agent; abortion; adolescent; adult; Article; Australia; Australian; breast tenderness; comparative effectiveness; condom use; contraceptive behavior; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; deep vein thrombosis; drug classification; drug cost; economic evaluation; ectopic pregnancy; emergency contraception; female; headache; health care utilization; heart infarction; household income; human; libido disorder; live birth; lung embolism; major clinical study; menstrual irregularity; nausea; ovary cancer; pharmacist; pharmacist attitude; pregnancy outcome; pregnancy rate; prescription; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; sexual behavior; sexually transmitted disease; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; unplanned pregnancy,2-s2.0-85065661250

Overall, personal burnout was 42.1% (n = 77), work-related burnout was 35% (n = 64) and client-related burnout was 27.9% (n = 51). Females were significantly (<0.05) more likely to have burnout in some or all domains. Four key themes were identified: supportive teamwork and relationships; providing high quality patient care; resourcing; and workload issues. Conclusions: Baseline indices of wellbeing of the frontline staff in a central city ED have been documented. These have informed wellbeing interventions. Future measures can be compared against these data. ? 2019 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine",burnout; emergency service; hospital; quality; wellbeing,adult; article; burnout; controlled study; emergency health service; emergency ward; female; human; major clinical study; New Zealand; patient care; quantitative analysis; staff; teamwork; wellbeing; workload; workplace,2-s2.0-85062330608

Therefore, we set out to describe epidemiology, demographics and severity of intentional HIs in childhood. Methods: A planned secondary analysis of a prospective multicentre cohort study was conducted in 10 EDs in Australia and New Zealand, including children aged <18 years with HIs. Epidemiology codes were used to prospectively code the injuries. Demographic and clinical information including the rate of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI: HI leading to death, neurosurgery, intubation >1 day or admission ?2 days with abnormal computed tomography [CT]) was descriptively analysed. Results: Intentional injuries were identified in 372 of 20 137 (1.8%) head-injured children. Injuries were caused by caregivers (103, 27.7%), by peers (97, 26.1%), by siblings (47, 12.6%), by strangers (35, 9.4%), by persons with unknown relation to the patient (21, 5.6%), other intentional injuries (8, 2.2%) or undetermined intent (61, 16.4%). About 75.7% of victims of assault by caregivers were <2 years, whereas in other categories, only 4.9% were <2 years. Overall, 66.9% of victims were male. Rates of CT performance and abnormal CT varied: assault by caregivers 68.9%/47.6%, by peers 18.6%/27.8%, by strangers 37.1%/5.7%. ciTBI rate was 22.3% in assault by caregivers, 3.1% when caused by peers and 0.0% with other perpetrators. Conclusions: Intentional HI is infrequent in children. The most frequently identified perpetrators are caregivers and peers.

The emphasis on control for diabetes self-management can lead to feelings of self-blame and failure when targets are not reached. Self-compassion may offer an alternative way of relating to the self when such feelings arise, and in turn, positively influence diabetes health outcomes. However, little is known about how self-compassion relates to behavioural, clinical and emotional outcomes in adults with diabetes. The aim of the current study was therefore to determine the associations between self-compassion and diabetes-related health behaviours and clinical outcomes, and emotional health outcomes. Cross-sectional data from adults (N = 1907) aged 18–75?years with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, who participated in the second Diabetes MILES—Australia (MILES-2) study, were analysed. Behavioural outcomes were healthy eating and physical activity (SDSCA subscales); clinical outcome was self-reported haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c; an important measure of average blood glucose in diabetes management); emotional outcomes were depressive symptoms (PHQ-8), anxiety symptoms (GAD-7) and diabetes distress (PAID). Self-compassion was measured using the Self-Compassion Scale Short-Form (SCS-SF). Self-compassion was significantly lower among those with severe diabetes distress or moderate-to-severe symptoms of depression and anxiety, as compared to those with no/mild symptoms. Further, hierarchical linear regression analyses, split by diabetes type, revealed that self-compassion was significantly associated with all specified outcomes, with the strongest associations observed among the emotional outcomes (β range, ? 0.47 to ? 0.55; all p &lt; 0.01). The findings indicate self-compassion is meaningfully associated with more optimal behavioural, clinical and, especially, emotional outcomes in adults with diabetes. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Anxiety; Depression; Diabetes; Diabetes distress; Self-care; Self-compassion,,2-s2.0-85066992324

Indigenous people experience worse health compared with non-Indigenous people, including higher rates of avoidable visual impairment. Countries such as Australia and Canada have service delivery models aimed at improving access to eye care for Indigenous people. We will conduct a scoping review to identify and summarise these service delivery models to improve access to eye care for Indigenous people in high-income countries. Methods and analysis: An information specialist will conduct searches on MEDLINE, Embase and Global Health. All databases will be searched from their inception date with no language limits used. We will search the grey literature via websites of relevant government and service provider agencies. Field experts will be contacted to identify additional articles, and reference lists of relevant articles will be searched. All quantitative and qualitative study designs will be eligible if they describe a model of eye care service delivery aimed at Indigenous populations. Two reviewers will independently screen titles, abstracts and full-text articles; and complete data extraction. For each service delivery model, we will extract data on the context, inputs, outputs, Indigenous engagement and enabling health system functions. Where models were evaluated, we will extract details. We will summarise findings using descriptive statistics and thematic analysis. Ethics and dissemination: Ethical approval is not required, as our review will include published and publicly accessible data. This review is part of a project to improve access to eye care services for M?ori in Aotearoa New Zealand. The findings will be useful to policymakers, health service managers and clinicians responsible for eye care services in New Zealand, and other high-income countries with Indigenous populations. We will publish our findings in a peer-reviewed journal and develop an accessible summary of results for website posting and stakeholder meetings. ? 2019 Author(s).",eye care; healthcare access; indigenous peoples; ophthalmology; optometry; service delivery,clinical protocol; Embase; eye care; global health; health care access; health care delivery; high income country; human; indigenous people; informatician; Medline; meta analysis; qualitative research; Review; systematic review,2-s2.0-85070802439

This study aimed to explore patient factors that impact access to cancer trials in New Zealand. METHODS: A questionnaire that included demographics and factors that might impact trial participation was circulated via nine district health boards (DHBs) and four cancer foundations to patients with a cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Between July 2016 and August 2017, 691 patients responded, 62% female and 77% aged >50 years. Most patients (86%) would consider trial participation, which differed by income (p=0.0001) but not by age, tumour type or gender. Patients would consider attending another hospital (44%) or relocating (11%); 10% considered trials a last resort. Advantageous factors to participation included: benefiting others (92%), better treatment (82%), more scans and longer follow-up (47% and 51%). Disincentives included fear of randomisation (78%), treatment toxicities (71%), time and cost of more visits (40%) and unspecified future research (32%). CONCLUSION: Identified barriers to trial participation were similar in New Zealand to other developed countries. In this motivated cohort, patients are very interested in trial participation at any stage of their treatment and did not mind extra travel or tests. ?

Methods: Twenty-three eyes of 23 participants were compared between Zywave, OPD-Scan III, and iDesign aberrometers, for total ocular aberrations. Participants were between 19 and 69 years of age, and exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgery or trauma, contact lens wear within the preceding 2 weeks, and ocular or systemic disease. Corneal aberrations were compared between the OPD-Scan III and GALILEI? G2 aberrometers. Zernike coefficients of vertical and oblique trefoil, vertical and horizontal coma, and spherical aberration were analyzed in R software. Results: In all, 276 scans were captured in total, with a male-to-female ratio of 11:12. Total ocular vertical coma [mean difference (MD) = 0.026 μm, P &lt; 0.005], vertical trefoil (MD = 0.033 μm, P &lt; 0.05), and spherical aberration (MD = 0.022 μm, P &lt; 0.05) differed significantly between the iDesign and OPD-Scan III. Differences in total vertical (MD = 0.072 μm, P &lt; 0.05) and oblique trefoil (MD = 0.058 μm, P &lt; 0.05) were demonstrated between the Zywave and OPD-Scan III, and spherical aberration (MD = 0.030 μm, P &lt; 0.005) between iDesign and Zywave. iDesign corneal horizontal coma (MD = 0.025 μm, P &lt; 0.05) and spherical aberration (MD = 0.043 μm, P &lt; 0.005) measurements were significantly different between the GALILEI?

This study sought to describe the musculature of the human PBJ by generating a three-dimensional reconstruction of histologic sections. A single pancreaticoduodenal specimen was removed en bloc from an embalmed cadaver with no pancreaticoduodenal disease. Sections were stained with Masson's trichrome and the staining pattern of muscle fibers was used to generate information regarding their location and orientation. The outline of groups of muscle fibers taken from photomicrographs of alternate thin serial sections were highlighted based upon their orientation (circular or longitudinal) and location (duodenal or papillary). Data point co-ordinates were used to create a 3-D image reconstruction. A total of 91 composite serial cross-sections were reconstructed. Circular and longitudinal muscle fibers formed a completely investing muscle layer around both the bile and pancreatic ducts, and there was a clear distinction between the intrinsic muscles of the PBJ and those of the duodenal wall. Circular fibers were particularly dense distal to the confluence of the ducts. Longitudinal fibers were incompletely distributed around the pancreaticobiliary sphincter and did not extend to the tip of the major duodenal papilla. This model supports the well-established concept of an intrinsic pancreaticobiliary sphincter composed of circular and longitudinal muscle fibers, distinct from the surrounding duodenal muscle. Targeting the distal end of the PBJ during ERCP would only partially disrupt this muscular sphincter mechanism. ? 2019 Sociedad Anatomica Espanola.

We set out to determine whether the effects on BMD and bone turnover persist beyond 10 years. We invited all participants in the original trial known to be alive and living in New Zealand to attend an additional visit approximately 12 years after trial entry and 11 years after their second dose of study medication. The outcome measures were BMD at the lumbar spine, proximal femur, and total body, and markers of bone turnover. Twenty-five of the 43 men originally enrolled in the trial attended the final visit, representing 25 of 31 (81%) participants alive and residing in New Zealand at the time. The average duration of follow-up was 12.4 years. At the final visit, BMD remained higher in the zoledronate group than the placebo group (lumbar spine 3.7%, 95% CI, 0.1 to 7.3; total hip 3.7%, 95% CI, 1.2 to 6.2; femoral neck 5.0%, 95% CI, 2.1 to 7.9; total body 2.4%, 95% CI, 0.7 to 4.0), and the between-group differences in BMD remained stable between 6 and 12 years. Serum CTx remained lower in the zoledronate group than the placebo group between 6 and 12 years and, at the final visit, was 45% lower (95% CI, 25 to 64) than the placebo group. P1NP was 26% (95% CI, 4 to 48) lower in the zoledronate group than the placebo group at the final visit.

Individuals with hyperuricaemia might develop gout — a painful inflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in articular structures. Hyperuricaemia is also associated with common chronic diseases, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Many mouse models have been developed to investigate the causal mechanisms for hyperuricaemia. These models are highly diverse and can be divided into two broad categories: mice with genetic modifications (genetically induced models) and mice exposed to certain environmental factors (environmentally induced models; for example, pharmaceutical or dietary induction). This Review provides an overview of the mouse models of hyperuricaemia and the relevance of these models to human hyperuricaemia, with an emphasis on those models generated through genetic modifications. The challenges in developing and comparing mouse models of hyperuricaemia and future research directions are also outlined. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",,breast cancer resistance protein; glucose transporter; SLC2A9 protein; unclassified drug; urate; urate oxidase; disease model; environmental factor; enzyme inhibition; experimental animal; gene expression; gene knockout; gene mutation; genetic background; genetically engineered mouse strain; gout; human; hyperuricemia; mortality; mouse model; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; survival; uric acid blood level,2-s2.0-85066261011

In addition, narratives of Indigenous health are often still shaped by colonial logics, with Indigenous data rights, priorities and governance overlooked or ignored. Researchers need to critique the use of ‘race’/ethnicity concepts and data in Indigenous health research. This requires an explicit shift away from describing ‘race’/ethnicity as ‘risk factors’ to examining processes by which ‘race’/ethnicity become meaningful in relation to health outcomes for Indigenous communities.

Methods: The study used data from the Growing Up in New Zealand birth cohort. Maternal-rated behavioural difficulties were assessed when children were aged 2 and 4.5 years (N = 5885). The ninetieth percentile of the Strengths and Difficulties total difficulties score was used to identify children who showed serious behavioural difficulties at each time point, with children then categorised as showing no difficulties, improved behaviour, later difficulties, and persistent difficulties. Predictors of interest related to maternal-reported mental health and parenting behaviour, family social support and exposure to physical and verbal inter-parental conflict. Results: Poor maternal mental health at multiple time points and authoritarian and physical punishment parenting styles were associated with an increased likelihood of developing behavioural difficulties at 4.5 years and showing persistent difficulties from 2 to 4.5 years. Physical punishment and authoritarian parenting styles also mediated the association between a history of verbal inter-parental conflict and both developing later difficulties and persistent difficulties, whereas only physical punishment parenting style mediated this association for a history of physical inter-parental conflict. The only factor that distinguished children who improved from children who persisted was maternal parenting self-evaluation at 9 months; mothers who had a better self-evaluation were more likely to have children who persisted than improved. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the importance of addressing mothers’ self-reported management of their children’s behavioural difficulties, inter-parental conflict and maternal emotional wellbeing. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Behaviour; Cohort; Inter-parental conflict; Longitudinal; Maternal mental health,,2-s2.0-85064675637

It is unclear whether the relationship of FGF23 with cardiovascular disease and mortality is confounded by obesity. We aimed to determine whether FGF23 concentrations decline following a reduction in adiposity after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Design: The effect of SG on FGF23 was evaluated in 22 obese adults (59% male) with type 2 diabetes. Fat mass, weight, BMI, plasma intact FGF23, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and leptin were determined at baseline and at 12?months following SG. Results: At baseline, median (IQR) age was 51 (43-54) years, fat mass 47.8 (41.0-59.4)?kg, BMI 40.9 (36.9-46.9)?kg/m2 and FGF23 66.2 (55.3-82.9)?pg/mL.

Change in FGF23 was not significantly associated with change in measures of adiposity, PTH or leptin. Conclusions: FGF23 concentrations decline in the setting of significant weight loss following SG, implying that increased FGF23 concentrations are a downstream consequence of obesity, which may confound its association with cardiometabolic dysfunction.

For example, weak electrical stimulation applied to the hand by wearing a “mesh glove” (MGS) can transiently increase primary motor cortex (M1) excitability. Conversely, transcranial direct current stimulation with the cathode over M1 (c-tDCS) can decrease corticomotor excitability. Objective/Hypothesis: We applied M1 c-tDCS as a priming adjuvant to MGS and hypothesised metaplastic effects would be apparent in improved motor performance and modulation of M1 inhibitory and facilitatory circuits. Methods: Sixteen right-handed neurologically healthy individuals participated in a repeated measures cross-over study; nine minutes of sham- or c-tDCS followed by 30 min of suprasensory threshold MGS. Dexterity of the non-dominant (left) hand was assessed using the grooved pegboard task, and measures of corticomotor excitability, intracortical facilitation, short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and SAI in the presence of SICI (SAIxSICI), were obtained at baseline, post-tDCS, and 0, 30 and 60 min post-MGS. Results: There was a greater improvement in grooved pegboard completion times with c-tDCS primed MGS than sham + MGS. There was also more pronounced disinhibition of SAI. However, disinhibition of SAI in the presence of SICI was less and rest motor threshold higher compared to sham + MGS. Conclusions: The results indicate a metaplastic modulation of corticomotor excitability with c-tDCS primed MGS. Further studies are warranted to determine how various stimulation approaches can induce metaplastic effects on M1 neuronal circuits to boost functional gains obtained with motor practice. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Metaplasticity; Primary motor cortex; Somatosensory stimulation; Transcranial direct current stimulation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,"adult; Article; controlled study; electromyography; facilitation; female; grooved pegboard test; human; human experiment; latent period; male; motor performance; nerve cell excitability; neurophysiology; normal human; primary motor cortex; priority journal; Purdue pegboard test; right handedness; somatosensory stimulation; transcranial direct current stimulation; crossover procedure; hand; motor activity; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; movement (physiology); nerve cell inhibition; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; randomization; transcranial direct current stimulation; young adult; Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Hand; Humans; Male; Motor Activity; Motor Cortex; Movement; Neural Inhibition; Neuronal Plasticity; Psychomotor Performance; Random Allocation; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85062365218

We compared childhood vaccination coverage rates between New York State (NYS) and New Zealand (NZ) as the vaccination strategies are different. Methods: We used vaccination records from the NYS Immunisation Information System and the National Immunisation Register of NZ to measure (i) vaccination coverage by school entry and by age six; (ii) coverage of different socio-demographic groups; and (iii) trend in vaccination coverage between 2011 and 2015. Results: We analysed the records of 583 767 NYS children and 269 800 NZ children 7 years of age. NZ children were 3.3–21.5% more likely than NYS children to receive each of the vaccines. Compared to NYS, NZ children were 39.6% more likely to be up-to-date by the start of school and 28.1% more likely to be up-to-date by age 6 years. Both NYS and NZ had statistically significant increases in the proportion of children who were up to date on each vaccine and all vaccines by the start of school and by 6 years of age (P < 0.001). Conclusions: We identified under-vaccinated groups and examined the point in the vaccine series where children were most vulnerable to being under-vaccinated. This information is useful in targeting future investigations and interventions aimed at mitigating disparities in vaccine coverage. This comparison of regions with different vaccination programmes and policies is important when considering whether the particular vaccination coverage strategies of one region could be adapted and applied for the benefit of another. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",,diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; hepatitis B vaccine; measles mumps rubella vaccine; poliomyelitis vaccine; Article; child; controlled study; demography; diphtheria; female; health care disparity; health program; hepatitis B; human; male; measles; measles vaccination; medical record review; mumps; New York; New Zealand; pertussis; poliomyelitis; preschool child; priority journal; rubella; tetanus; vaccination coverage; vulnerable population,2-s2.0-85056448087

The following electronic databases were searched to October 2018: CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, NEDLINE and PsycINFO. Study eligibility and methodological quality were assessed independently by two review authors. Data from qualitative studies were synthesised using thematic analysis. For quantitative studies, odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each intervention. Where appropriate, qualitative and quantitative data were integrated into a single synthesis using Bayesian methods. Findings: In total, 19 studies were identified for inclusion in the review.

METHOD: Women with singleton pregnancy and weight recorded at ?20 weeks and again in the third trimester comprised the study population. GWG categories (weight gain per week) were defined as low, normal or high. Maternal characteristics and pregnancy outcomes were compared between GWG categories. RESULTS: Study population comprised 604 women: 39.7% Pacific, 19.9% M?ori, 21.5% European. 70.5% were overweight or obese, and 65.1% lived in the highest deprivation decile areas. 70.7% had high, 16.1% had normal and 13.2% had low GWG.

This study aimed to examine the barriers and enablers to reclassification of medicines in Germany and provide recommendations for change. Methods: Face-to-face conversational interviews with purposively selected key informants in Germany were conducted in 2017 by a researcher informed in the area. Interviews were transcribed, coded in NVIVO and systematically analysed using a framework approach. Results: Twenty-four interviews were conducted with 32 participants including members of the committee considering reclassifications, and representatives from government, industry, health insurance, academia, and pharmacy, medical, and patients' organisations. A range of enablers and barriers emerged that influence reclassification including effects on the committee and process, or the desire of pharmaceutical companies to pursue reclassifications. Enabling market factors included the large population and a culture of self-medication. Enabling health system factors include the pharmacy-only category. Some pharmacy factors appeared enabling (e.g. a positive experience after reclassifying emergency contraception) while others appeared to hinder reclassification (e.g. insufficient pharmacy practice research). Some medical factors were enabling (e.g. reported waiting times) and others limited reclassification (e.g. opposition to some reclassifications). Some committee and government openness to reclassification and self-medication reportedly enabled reclassification, while conservatism was considered a barrier, particularly for classifications with special conditions for supply such as initial doctor diagnosis or other complexities. Some improvements to the committee constitution and considerations were recommended. Some participants found the reclassification process after the committee recommendation opaque, with opportunity for delays and political interference. Industry factors included both enablers such as capability in reclassification, and barriers, such as a perceived low market potential of some reclassifications, and doubt that some candidates would be approved. A need for more data emerged strongly, both pre-reclassification in applications, and post-reclassification. Many participants saw merit with reclassification in non-traditional areas such as hypertension, diabetes and oral contraception. Conclusions: Many factors influence reclassification in Germany.

Also, in New Zealand, certain factors that contribute to postoperative infection are more common in Maori and Pacific populations. To date, most efforts to reduce postoperative infection have focussed on surgical aspects of care and on antibiotic prophylaxis, but recent research shows that anaesthesia providers may also have an impact on infection transmission. These providers sometimes exhibit imperfect hand hygiene and frequently transfer the blood or saliva of their patients to their work environment. In addition, intravenous medications may become contaminated whilst being drawn up and administered to patients. Working with relevant practitioners and other experts, we have developed an evidence-informed bundle to improve key aseptic practices by anaesthetists with the aim of reducing postoperative infection. The key elements of the bundle are the filtering of compatible drugs, context-relevant hand hygiene practices and enhanced maintenance of clean work surfaces. Methods: We will seek support for implementation of the bundle from senior anaesthesia and hospital leadership and departmental ""champions"". Anaesthetic teams and recovery room staff will be educated about the bundle and its potential benefits through presentations, written material and illustrative videos. We will implement the bundle in operating rooms where hip or knee arthroplasty or cardiac surgery procedures are undertaken in a five-site, stepped wedge, cluster randomised, quality improvement design. We will compare outcomes between approximately 5000 cases before and 5000 cases after implementation of our bundle. Outcome data will be collected from existing national and hospital databases. Our primary outcome will be days alive and out of hospital to 90 days, which is expected to reflect all serious postoperative infections. Our secondary outcome will be the rate of surgical site infection. Aseptic practice will be observed in sampled cases in each cluster before and after implementation of the bundle. Discussion: If effective, our bundle may offer a practical clinical intervention to reduce postoperative infection and its associated substantial human and financial costs.

This article reviews three different types of possible regulation of DTCA: government regulation, industry self-regulation and a mixture of the two. Recent studies demonstrate that DTC ads in the US continue to be misleading and contain minimal if any educational value, despite governmental regulatory efforts by the Food and Drug Administration. Other regulatory models are equally unsuccessful at controlling DTCA. Available evidence suggests that DTC ads are commonly misinterpreted as trusted public health messages and are more likely to affect vulnerable subgroups of New Zealanders. Taken together with the international evidence that regulation has consistently failed to prevent the inappropriate promotion of prescription medicines, these findings suggest that DTCA is more likely to cause harm than benefit and should be banned. ?

Objectives: To determine children’s longer-term (4 years) patterns and predictors of recovery. Methods: Parents of 196 children (aged 1–15 years) completed the Behaviour Assessment System for Children and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory at baseline, 1, 6, 12, and 48 months post-injury. Children aged ?8 years at each assessment completed a computerized neurocognitive testing battery. At 1 month, parents completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multilevel modeling accounted for repeated measures. Results: Children had significantly fewer child behavior problems, better adaptability, and improved quality of life after 12 months. Concurrent improvements in overall neurocognitive function were no longer significant once adjusted for age, gender, and socio-economic status. From 12 to 48 months, quality of life reduced significantly while child behavior and neurocognition plateaued. Child behavior problems and worse quality of life were associated with parental anxiety and lower socio-economic status. Conclusions: Children’s recovery in the year following mTBI appears to plateau from 12 to 48 months, with a concomitant reduction in quality of life.

We investigated associations of telomere length with vascular structure and function in children and midlife adults. Methods and Results: Population-based cross-sectional CheckPoint (Child Health CheckPoint) study of 11- to 12-year-old children and their parents, nested within the LSAC (Longitudinal Study of Australian Children). Telomere length (telomeric genomic DNA [T]/β-globin single-copy gene [S] [T/S ratio]) was measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction from blood-derived genomic DNA. Vascular structure was assessed by carotid intima-media thickness, and vascular function was assessed by carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity and carotid elasticity. Mean (SD) T/S ratio was 1.09 (0.55) in children (n=1206; 51% girls) and 0.81 (0.38) in adults (n=1343; 87% women). Linear regression models, adjusted for potential confounders, revealed no evidence of an association between T/S ratio and carotid intima-media thickness, carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity, or carotid elasticity in children. In adults, longer telomeres were associated with greater carotid elasticity (0.14% per 10–mm?Hg higher per unit of T/S ratio; 95% CI, 0.04%–0.2%; P=0.007), but not carotid intima-media thickness (?0.9?μm; 95% CI, ?14 to 13 μm; P=0.9) or carotid-femoral pulse-wave velocity (?0.10?m/s; 95% CI, ?0.3 to 0.07 m/s; P=0.2). In logistic regression analysis, telomere length did not predict poorer vascular measures at either age. Conclusions: In midlife adults, but not children, there was some evidence that telomere length was associated with vascular elasticity but not thickness.

Information provided to pregnant women about fetal movements is inconsistent perhaps due to limited knowledge about normal fetal movement patterns in healthy pregnancies. We aimed to describe maternally perceived fetal movement strength, frequency, and pattern in late pregnancy in women with subsequent normal outcomes. Methods Participants were 28 weeks’ gestation, with a non-anomalous, singleton pregnancy who had been randomly selected from hospital booking lists and had consented to participate. Fetal movement data was gathered during pregnancy via a questionnaire administered face-to-face by research midwives. Participants remained eligible for the study if they subsequently gave birth to a live, appropriate-for-gestational-age baby at 37 weeks. Results Participants were 274 women, with normal pregnancy outcomes. The majority (59.3%, n = 162) of women reported during antenatal interview that the strength of fetal movements had increased in the preceding two weeks. Strong fetal movements were felt by most women in the evening (72.8%, n = 195) and at night-time including bedtime (74.5%, n = 199). The perception of fetal hiccups was also reported by most women (78.8%). Women were more likely to perceive moderate or strong fetal movements when sitting quietly compared with other activities such as having a cold drink or eating. Conclusions Our data support informing women in the third trimester that as pregnancy advances it is normal to perceive increasingly strong movement, episodes of movements that are more vigorous than usual, fetal hiccups, and a diurnal pattern involving strong fetal movement in the evening. This information may help pregnant women to better characterise normal fetal movement and appropriately seek review when concerned about fetal movements. Care providers should be responsive to concerns about decreased fetal movements in the evening, as this is unusual. ? 2019 Bradford et al.

Aim: To investigate associations between electrocardiogram (ECG) and chest radiograph abnormalities and biochemical evidence of cardiac dysfunction (N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide and troponin T) in patients hospitalised with exacerbations of COPD at Waikato Hospital. Methods: Independent examiners, blinded to NT-proBNP and troponin T levels, assessed ECG for tachycardia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular hypertrophy and ischaemic changes in 389 patients and chest radiographs for signs of heart failure in 350 patients. Associations between electrocardiographic and radiographic abnormalities with at least moderate interrater agreement and cardiac biomarkers were analysed. Results: High NT-proBNP values (>220 pmol/L) were associated with atrial fibrillation (22 vs 6%), right ventricular hypertrophy (24 vs 15%), left ventricular hypertrophy (15 vs 4%), ischaemia (59 vs 33%) and cardiomegaly (42 vs 20%). High troponin T values (>0.03ug/L or high-sensitivity >50 ng/L) were associated with tachycardia (65 vs 41%), right ventricular hypertrophy (26 vs 15%) and ischaemia (60 vs 36%). None of the electrocardiographic or radiographic abnormalities was sensitive or specific for cardiac biomarker abnormalities. Ischaemia on ECG was the best indicator for raised NT-proBNP (sensitivity 59%, specificity 67%). Tachycardia and ischaemia were the best indicators of raised troponin T (sensitivity 65 and 60%, specificity 59 and 64% respectively). Conclusions: ECG and chest radiograph abnormalities have poor sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing acute cardiac dysfunction in exacerbations of COPD.

Data Sources: Data are from a nationally representative health and well-being survey of 8500 New Zealand high school students from 91 high schools. Study Design: Student data were linked to the level of SBHS available to them: no SBHS, regular clinics from visiting health professionals, a health professional onsite, or a health team onsite. Data Collection/Extraction Methods: Causal analyses are used to compare utilization of SBHS and their association with student-reported health outcomes, including foregone health care, depressive symptoms, emotional and behavioral difficulties, suicide risk, substance use, and unsafe sexual behaviors. Principal Findings: Results from the multinomial propensity score–weighted regressions show that the use of SBHS was associated with poorer health outcomes, suggesting that selection bias was present due to unmeasured confounders. Instrumental variable analyses found that that students using team-based SBHS had a 4.7 percent (95% CI 0.5-8.9) probability of high levels of depressive symptoms compared to 14.2 percent (95% CI 11.5-16.8) among students not using team SBHS. For suicide attempt, students using team-based SBHS had a 2.0 percent (95% CI ?0.3-4.2) probability of a suicide attempt in the previous 12?months compared to 5.6 percent (95% CI 2.6-8.5) among students not using team SBHS. Conclusions: These analyses suggest that team-based SBHS are associated with better mental health among students who attend them. ?

Peptides have also been used as lead compounds for therapeutics targeting metabolic disease. It is therefore important to understand the activity and function of islet hormones in both their target tissues and the whole organism. Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)is an insulin homolog secreted by the islet β-cells. Vesiculin is a newly discovered peptide hormone, processed from IGF-II and secreted from islet β-cells in response to glucose. We postulated that vesiculin might act to regulate systemic glucose metabolism. Here we report our original investigations of vesiculin's activity in relation to glucoregulation. Vesiculin and IGF-II displayed similar dose-response relationships for lowering blood glucose in insulin-responsive FVB/n mice. By contrast, the ability of IGF-II to lower blood glucose was blunted in insulin-resistant triprolyl human-amylin transgenic mice, whereas vesiculin's ability to lower blood glucose remained unaffected. We also confirmed the ability of vesiculin to bypass insulin resistance in a second mouse model. In vitro analysis of signalling by vesiculin and IGF-II indicates that, like IGF-II, vesiculin signals through the IR/ IGF1R. Overall, we show that removal of only four amino acids from IGF-II has generated a peptide hormone with different bioactivity relevant to blood-glucose regulation. Investigating the differences among vesiculin, IGF-II and insulin signalling and activity may provide new insights into insulin resistance and potentially inform the design of novel therapeutics ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Diabetes; IGF-II; Insulin resistance; Vesiculin,glucose; insulin derivative; peptide hormone; somatomedin B; somatomedin C receptor; unclassified drug; vesiculin; animal experiment; Article; biological activity; controlled study; dose response; drug potency; FVB/N mouse; glucose blood level; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin signaling; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; transgenic mouse,2-s2.0-85064743726

Methods: A total of 155 patients were treated in a prospective, single-arm study at 17 centers in the United States, Europe, and New Zealand. The primary endpoint was a composite of device- or procedure-related death or myocardial infarction (MI)over the course of 30 days, or target lesion revascularization (TLR), major amputation of the target limb, or re-stenosis through 9-months. Secondary endpoints included primary patency, TLR, sustained clinical success, quality of life, and major adverse events (MAE). Results: At 9 months, the primary composite endpoint rate was 16.2% (93.5% confidence interval [CI]: 10.6%–23.2%), primary patency was 89.1% (95% CI: 82.6%–93.7%), and freedom from TLR was 96%. There was a cumulative clinical improvement of at least one Rutherford category from baseline to 9 months of 90.5% (95% CI: 84.3%–94.9%). Quality of life, assessed by using the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), demonstrated a mean change in total score from baseline through 9 months of 32.1 ± 26.84; overall, improvements were noted from baseline in each WIQ category. Seven of one-hundred fifty patients (4.7%; 95% CI: 1.9%–9.4%)experienced MAEs, but none were determined to be related to device or procedure. Conclusions: The LIFESTREAM balloon-expandable covered stent provided satisfactory 9-month clinical outcomes including a low rate of target lesion revascularization for the treatment of stenotic and occlusive lesions of the iliac arteries. ? 2019 SIR",,"politef; adult; adverse event; Article; clinical outcome; Europe; female; follow up; functional assessment; heart infarction; human; iliac artery obstruction; limb amputation; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; New Zealand; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; restenosis; sample size; target lesion revascularization; United States; vascular access; aged; clinical trial; devices; diagnostic imaging; iliac artery; middle aged; pathophysiology; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; peripheral occlusive artery disease; prosthesis design; stent; time factor; treatment outcome; vascular patency; Aged; Angioplasty, Balloon; Europe; Female; Humans; Iliac Artery; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Prospective Studies; Prosthesis Design; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States; Vascular Patency",2-s2.0-85063887183

However, recurrences of rheumatic fever (RRF) persist disproportionately affecting M?ori and Pacific youth. Reasons for recurrence rates are not well understood and commonly attributed to patient non-adherence. This research explored M?ori and Pacific family experiences of RRF to better understand barriers to accessing secondary prophylaxis to inform health service improvements. Methods: Participants were M?ori and Pacific patients who had RRF or unexpected rheumatic heart disease and their family; and health professionals working in RF contexts. Kaupapa M?ori, Talanga and Kakala Pacific qualitative methodologies were employed. Data were thematically analysed using a general inductive approach. Results: Data collection included 38 interviews with patients and families (n=80), six focus group interviews and nine interviews with health providers (n=33) from seven geographic regions. Three key themes were identified where mismatches occurred between services and community needs: 1. Model of delivery; 2. Interpersonal approaches to care; and 3. Adolescent care. Conclusions and Public health implications: Successful RRF prevention requires interventions to address structural causes of inequity, appropriate clinical guidelines and quality health services. Service-delivery models should provide regular prophylaxis in an accessible manner through culturally-safe, community-based, age-appropriate care. ? 2019 The Authors",health service delivery; M?ori health; Pacific health; rheumatic fever recurrence; rheumatic heart disease,"adolescent; attitude to health; epidemiology; ethnology; female; health care delivery; human; indigenous health care; information processing; interview; male; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; organization and management; procedures; psychology; qualitative research; rheumatic fever; rheumatic heart disease; secondary prevention; statistics and numerical data; Adolescent; Attitude to Health; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Qualitative Research; Rheumatic Fever; Rheumatic Heart Disease; Secondary Prevention",2-s2.0-85063403791

A Healthy Lifestyle Index (HLI) was developed to examine the combined effect of modifiable lifestyle factors on asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema using data from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) phase III. Methods Information on symptoms of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis, eczema and several lifestyle factors was obtained from children aged 6-7 years through written questionnaires. The HLI combined five lifestyle factors: no parental smoking, child's adherence to Mediterranean diet, child's healthy body mass index, high physical activity and non-sedentary behaviour. The association between the HLI and risk of asthma, rhinoconjunctivitis and eczema was evaluated using multilevel mixed-effects logistic regression models. Findings Data of 70 795 children from 37 centres in 19 countries were analysed. Each additional healthy lifestyle factor was associated with a reduced risk of current wheeze (OR 0.87, 95% CI 0.84 to 0.89), asthma ever (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.87 to 0.92), current symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.97) and current symptoms of eczema (OR 0.92, 95% CI 0.92 to 0.98). Theoretically, if associations were causal, a combination of four or five healthy lifestyle factors would result into a reduction up to 16% of asthma cases (ranging from 2.7% to 26.3 % according to region of the world). Conclusions These findings should be interpreted with caution given the limitations to infer causality from cross-sectional observational data. Efficacy of interventions to improve multiple modifiable lifestyle factors to reduce the burden asthma and allergy in childhood should be assessed. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Methods: Primary healthcare nurses in the Auckland region were surveyed in 2006–2008 and 2016, with about one-third of practice, home care and specialist nurses randomly selected to participate. Nurses completed a self-administered questionnaire about demographic and workplace details, and a telephone interview about clinical care provided for people with diabetes during nursing consultations. Information was collected on a representative sample of people with diabetes consulted on one randomly selected work-day in the previous week. Results: Of all people with diabetes consulted by nurses, practice nurses consulted significantly more in 2016 (83%) compared with 60% in 2006–2008, whereas specialist nurse consultations decreased from 23% to 8% (P?=?0.01). In 2016, in people with diabetes, BMI was higher, and total cholesterol lower, yet the proportions of those receiving lifestyle advice (dietary and activity) remained unchanged from 2006–2008 levels. Smoking prevalence in people with diabetes was unchanged between the two surveys, although more people were asked if they wished to stop in 2016 compared with 2006–2008 (98% vs. 73%). In 2016, hours of nurses’ diabetes education were associated with increased routine assessments of risk factors in people with diabetes and checking laboratory results. Conclusions: Practice nurses are undertaking an increasing proportion of diabetes consultations. Although BMI in people with diabetes is increasing, the proportion of nurses offering lifestyle advice remains unchanged. Increasing diabetes education could strengthen the management of people with diabetes by community nurses. ? 2019 Diabetes UK",,article; body mass; case report; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; clinical assessment; consultation; diabetes education; diabetic patient; diet; home care; human; lifestyle; New Zealand; nurse; prevalence; primary health care; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; smoking; telephone interview; workplace,2-s2.0-85063072929

However, to date no studies have explored the impact of student nurse's cultural heritage on their beliefs and understanding of dementia. Objectives: To explore the cultural beliefs of dementia of student nurses studying in England, Slovenia, Philippines and New Zealand. Design: An explorative hermeneutic phenomenology design. Settings: Higher Education Institutes delivering undergraduate nursing education in England (University of Greenwich and University of Essex), Slovenia (Angela Bo?kin Faculty of Health Care), New Zealand (University of Auckland), and the Philippines (University of Silliman). Participants: Student nurses studying nursing in England (n = 81), Slovenia (n = 41), Philippines (n = 53) and New Zealand (n = 6). Participants from England and New Zealand were from diverse cultural backgrounds. Student nurses at the beginning of their studies (n = 100) and towards the end of their studies (n = 81) participated. Methods: Completion of focus groups (n = 23), in England (n = 10), Slovenia (n = 6), Philippines (n = 6), and New Zealand (n = 1). All focus groups were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data was analysed by applying an inductive theoretical approach of the Framework Method, which supports the generation of themes through open unhindered coding, pinpointing, examining, and recording patterns within the data. Results: Two major themes were identified in the data: familial piety and dementia discourse. Familial piety emerged from the importance of family and caring for family members with dementia, subthemes included: ‘my granddad’: familial experience, and ‘better to be with her’: familial home. Dementia discourse emerged from the terminology student nurses applied, such as: ‘preconceptions and misconceptions’ of aggression, and ‘considered crazy’ stigma of dementia due to a lack of awareness. Conclusions: The cultural heritage of student nurses impacted on their beliefs of dementia; however their understanding of the needs, care and support of a person with dementia changed and developed through clinical experience and education. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Culture; dementia; focus groups; nurse education; qualitative,"complication; dementia; England; health personnel attitude; hermeneutics; human; information processing; New Zealand; nursing education; nursing student; Philippines; procedures; psychology; qualitative research; Slovenia; Attitude of Health Personnel; Dementia; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; England; Focus Groups; Hermeneutics; Humans; New Zealand; Philippines; Qualitative Research; Slovenia; Students, Nursing",2-s2.0-85062887724

To investigate the implications of patient-specific factors on postoperative morbidities and hospital stay length, including the role of BMI and AH as predictors for airway complications following surgery. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients presenting at The Children's Hospital at Westmead for routine tonsillectomy between July 2010 and July 2014. Results: Of 500 charts, 420 patients met inclusion criteria. 155 (37%) patients had a pre-existing comorbidity. Polysomnogram (PSG) was conducted prior to surgery (n = 129). BMI results showed a mean BMI of 20.0, n = 25 were overweight, n = 70 were obese and n = 11 underweight. 84 patients (20%) experienced a postoperative complication/unexpected morbidity. There were no returns to theatre and no mortality. 24 patients had more than one complication. Complication rate was highest in the patients <2 years of age.

It aimed to explore facilitators and barriers to 4-year-old children sleeping well, as experienced by M?ori and non-M?ori mothers, with low and high socioeconomic position (SEP), in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Design: Experiential qualitative research involving face-to-face, semistructured individual interviews. Participants: Fifteen M?ori (low SEP = 7; high SEP = 8) and 16 non-M?ori (low SEP = 7; high SEP = 9) mothers of preschoolers. Measurements: Interviews were guided by questions about how preschoolers slept and what mothers thought made a difference to their child's sleep. Data were analyzed inductively using thematic analysis. Results: Four themes were identified: “health, activity, and diet”; “sleep-promoting physical environments”; “consistency”; and “doing it our way.” Children being healthy and active, sleep-conducive bedroom spaces, consistent routines, and supportive social environments assisted preschoolers to sleep well. However, broader contextual factors beyond mothers' control influenced the degree of autonomy they had over implementing sleep-supporting strategies that worked for their families. External influences included access to financial resources; parental work patterns; early childhood education service practices; access to quality housing; and affordable, culturally responsive, and respectful professional sleep advice. Conclusion: Efforts aimed at facilitating healthy sleep among preschoolers and effective preschooler sleep interventions must go beyond simply recommending individual-focused sleep-promoting tips to include actions on the social determinants of sleep and the sociopolitical drivers that influence these. ? 2019 National Sleep Foundation.",Autonomy; M?ori; Preschooler sleep; Qualitative; Social determinants; Socioeconomic position,"article; child; childhood; clinical article; diet; driver; education; female; housing; human; human experiment; infant; interview; mother; New Zealand; nonREM sleep; qualitative research; respect; social determinants of health; social environment; thematic analysis; adult; male; middle aged; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; preschool child; psychology; sleep; socioeconomics; young adult; Adult; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mothers; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Qualitative Research; Sleep; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85061318242

This study objective was to evaluate outcomes for patients with stage 3 PDAC with potentially reconstructable arterial involvement, considered for neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and pancreatic resection, and to compare outcomes following arterial (AR) and non-arterial resection (NAR). Methods: This study included patients from 2009 to 2016 with biopsy-proven stage 3 PDAC who were offered NAT before surgical exploration. AR was performed if required to achieve R0 resection. Time to event outcomes were analysed from diagnosis date. Results: 87/89 patients (97.8%) received NAT (chemotherapy 41.6%, chemotherapy/radiotherapy 56.2%). 46/89 (51.7%) underwent exploration; 31 underwent resection (AR n = 20, NAR n = 11). AR patients had longer operative time (681 vs. 563 min, p = 0.006) and more blood loss (1600 vs. 575 mL, p = 0.0004), with no difference for blood transfusion, pancreatic fistula, length of stay, reoperation, or mortality. R0 rate was 30/31. Post-resection 90-day mortality was 3.2%. Median overall survival was statistically comparable between the AR and NAR groups (19.7 vs. 28.4 months, p = 0.41). Conclusions: AR had comparable clinical and oncologic outcomes to NAR. Following careful selection and non-progression after NAT, major AR may cautiously be considered if required to obtain a negative resection margin. ? 2018",,capecitabine; cisplatin; fluorouracil; gemcitabine; irinotecan; oxaliplatin; paclitaxel; adult; aged; artery surgery; Article; blood transfusion; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer staging; chemoradiotherapy; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; operation duration; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreas fistula; reoperation; retrospective study,2-s2.0-85056808101

Also, an oxygen radical absorbance capacity method was carried out to evaluate the plasma samples antioxidant capacity changes. Subjects showed increase in plasma antioxidant capacity after juice intake (p-values < .05). A total of 114 metabolites were assessed in urine (1–2 h and 2–4 h), including 17 amino acids, 47 organic acids and several other metabolites. Among the 114 metabolites, 25 were significantly changed during the first 4 h following juice intake, as shown by the Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (0.5 > p(corr) > 0.3) and univariate analysis (p-values < .05). Some metabolites were related to mitochondrial metabolism, such as glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid. Metabolites related to amino acid metabolism were also changed, such as beta-alanine, L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. In conclusion, results suggest that acute intake of grumixama juice could affect amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial metabolism, but the related health implications should be explored in further studies using additional approaches. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Anthocyanins; Ellagitannins; Metabolomic approach; Mitochondrial metabolism,Amino acids; Anthocyanins; Antioxidants; Biomolecules; Body fluids; Discriminant analysis; Essential oils; Gas chromatography; Least squares approximations; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Metabolites; Physiology; Amino acid metabolism; Ellagitannins; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Methyl chloroformate; Mitochondrial metabolism; Oxygen radical absorbance capacities; Partial least squares - discriminant analysis; Oxalic acid,2-s2.0-85056420155

The Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy was used to assess the presence of behaviour change strategies, while the Mobile App Rating Scale was used to assess overall app quality. Raters found, on average, 7.13 behaviour change techniques out of a possible 93, indicating few behaviour change techniques in apps for the self-management of Type 2 diabetes. Analysis indicated that apps of a higher overall quality tended to incorporate more behaviour change strategies. It was concluded that mental-health professionals are advantaged if they are able to assess and refine selection tools for matching apps with the needs of students with diabetes. ?

Evidence for preoperative prediction of POPF based on cross-sectional imaging has not been systemically reviewed. This review aimed to determine whether preoperative imaging modalities can accurately predict the development of POPF. Methods: A systematic review of major reference databases was undertaken, according to PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, up to May 2018. Results: There were 18 studies (2150 patients), seven used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), five used computed tomography (CT) scans, four used transabdominal ultrasonography and one study each used MRI and CT and endoscopic ultrasonography elastography. All were retrospective, single-centre studies. Intensity of the pancreas signal relative to the spleen, liver or muscle was commonly used. Other studies compared signal intensity between unenhanced and post-contrast-enhanced pancreas, apparent diffusion coefficient values comparing normal parenchyma to fibrosis, perfusion fraction (f) of intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted imaging, or utilized a muscle-normalized signal intensity curve with signal intensity ratio or directly assessed pancreatic volume and duct width. Shear wave velocity measurement on transabdominal ultrasonography may reflect pancreas tissue fibrosis or stiffness and predict POPF. Most parameters used to predict the development of POPF were based on identifying imaging features of a fatty or fibrotic pancreas and main pancreatic duct diameter. Conclusion: A number of different and highly promising parameters have been used for preoperative prediction of POPF using ultrasound, MRI, CT or both. Large multicentre prospective studies are needed to determine which parameters most accurately predict POPF, using standardized definitions and methodology. ? 2018 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons",cancer; pancreas; radiology; surgery,,2-s2.0-85054642294

Methods: A 16-question survey was sent to clinical directors of all Level 3 units in Australia and New Zealand via the network. Reminder emails were sent, as required, to prompt a satisfactory response rate. Results: Survey responses were received from 26 of the 29 (90%) ANZNN Level 3 units. At 37 weeks' corrected gestation, over 90% of the units provide ongoing respiratory support in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, by 50 weeks, ongoing care is provided in several settings, including NICU, high dependency unit (HDU)/paediatric intensive care unit or respiratory wards. The majority (76%) of units arrange transfer on an ad hoc basis, but six units (24%) have set criteria for transfer based on gestation, workload and respiratory requirement. Three units declared a maximum age in NICU (44, 46 or 48 weeks). A variety of approaches were used to identify infants who were likely to require transfer, and 78% of units had a staff member assigned to assist transition. Three units stated that they had a home ventilation programme suitable for these infants. No unit supplied a guideline on tracheostomy or specific respiratory management post-term. Conclusion: Despite a significant number of babies requiring ongoing support for severe CLD, the location of the service appears very variable, and there is a lack of specific written guidelines. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",bronchopulmonary dysplasia; network; practice survey; severe chronic lung disease,Article; assisted ventilation; Australia; chronic lung disease; controlled study; disease severity; health service; health survey; human; infant; neonatal intensive care unit; New Zealand; practice guideline; pregnancy; prematurity; priority journal; tracheostomy,2-s2.0-85054579718

In rhinosinusitis patients, endoscopic sinus surgery aims to alleviate obstruction and re-establish mucociliary clearance. Surgery alters the structure-function relationship within the nasal passage, which is difficult to assess clinically. Computational modelling has been used to investigate this relationship by simulating air flow and environmental variables inside realistic three-dimensional models of the human nasal airway but many questions remain unanswered and need further investigation. The application of computational models to improve pre-surgical planning and post-surgical treatment may not be currently possible due to the absence of knowledge correlating the model-predicted parameters to physiological variables. Links between these parameters to patient outcomes are yet to be established.

Compared to the general population of childbearing women, M?ori and Pasifika women are more likely to experience gestational diabetes mellitus and obesity, are less likely to attend recommended antenatal visits and present for initial antenatal visits at later gestations. Aim: To describe women's awareness of maternity service options, explore the barriers to participating in pregnancy care and identify possible enablers to improved uptake of services. Method: Qualitative descriptive. Thirty-three women attended one of six culturally specific focus groups. Latent content analysis was used to analyse the data set. Findings: The key source of information for childbearing women was their families. Poor communication, lack of cultural safety and financial constraints were the major barriers to accessing services. Conversely, enablers were perceived to be continuity of midwifery care that was delivered in the community and was culturally safe. Discussion: Strategies to increase uptake of maternity services and optimise services to better meet the needs of women from M?ori and Pasifika backgrounds are needed. These should be partnership-based, engage women and families, incorporate cultural needs and preferences and provide services at accessible community locations. Conclusion: These findings may be relevant to other groups of women, such as women from culturally diverse backgrounds and from communities experiencing poorer health outcomes. ? 2018 Australian College of Midwives",Access; Migrant health; M?ori women; Pacific women; Pregnancy,adult; article; Australia; awareness; clinical article; content analysis; controlled study; cultural safety; female; human; human experiment; maternal care; midwife; migrant; perception; pregnancy; ethnic group; health care delivery; information processing; maternal health service; patient attitude; perception; pregnancy; prenatal care; psychology; Queensland; Adult; Ethnic Groups; Female; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Maternal Health Services; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Perception; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Queensland,2-s2.0-85052797849

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of self-reported gout and gout flares, the use of urate-lowering therapy (ULT), and the association of gout flares with health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in a large community sample. Covariate associations with flare frequency and allopurinol use were also examined. Methods: The South Australian Health Omnibus Survey is an annual, face-to-face population-based survey. Data collected in the 2017 survey included self-reported medically diagnosed gout, allopurinol use (first-line ULT in Australia), and gout attacks (flares) in the last 12 months, in addition to sociodemographic variables and health-related quality of life (HRQoL, SF-12). Data were weighted to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2016 census data to reflect the South Australian population. Participants 25 years and over (n = 2778) were included in the analysis. Results: The prevalence of gout was 6.5% (95%CI 5.5, 7.5). Amongst participants with gout, 37.1% (95%CI 29.6, 45.3) reported currently using allopurinol, while 23.2% (95%CI 16.9, 21.0) reported prior use (38% discontinuation rate). Frequent flares (? 2 in the last year) were reported by 25% of participants with gout and were more likely with younger age, higher body mass index, and current allopurinol use (p < 0.05). The frequency of gout flares was associated with a lower physical HRQoL (p = 0.012). Current allopurinol use was reported by 51% of participants with frequent gout flares. Conclusion: Flares were frequently reported by people with gout in the community. Gout flares were associated with reduced physical HRQoL. Almost one half of people with frequent gout flares were not receiving allopurinol, and current allopurinol use was associated with frequent gout flares, suggesting undertreated disease and suboptimal use of ULT. Determining covariate associations with flares and ineffective allopurinol use may identify means of improving treatment and reducing flares. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Allopurinol; Gout; Gout flares; Population study; Prevalence; Self-reported,allopurinol; adult; age; aged; Article; body mass; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; demography; disease association; disease duration; disease exacerbation; drug use; female; gout; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; population research; prevalence; quality of life; self report,2-s2.0-85066459706

This study aimed to describe the current practices for performing lower limb vascular assessments by podiatrists in the UK, and, to investigate the effect of practitioner characteristics, including education level and practice setting, on the choice of tests used for these assessments. Methods: A cross-sectional observational online survey of registered podiatrists in the UK was conducted using SurveyMonkey? between 1st of July and 5th of October 2018. Item content related to: practitioner characteristics, vascular testing methods, barriers to completing vascular assessment, interpretation of vascular assessment techniques, education provision and ongoing management and referral pathways. Descriptive statistics were performed, and multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to determine whether practitioner characteristics could predict the choice of vascular tests used. Results: Five hundred and eighty five participants accessed the online survey. After drop-outs and exclusions, 307 participants were included in the analyses. Comprehensive vascular assessments had most commonly been performed once (15.8%) or twice (10.4%) in the past week. The most common indicators for performing vascular assessment were symptoms of suspected claudication (89.3%), suspected rest pain (86.0%) and history of diabetes (85.3%). The most common barrier to performing vascular assessment was time constraints (52.4%). Doppler examination (72.3%) was the most frequently reported assessment type, with ankle-brachial index (31.9%) and toe brachial index (5.9%) less frequently performed. There were variable interpretations of vascular test results. The most common topic for education was smoking cessation (69.5%). Most participants (72.2%) were confident in determining ongoing management, with the majority referring to the patient's general practitioner (67.6%). Practitioner characteristics did not predict the types of vascular tests performed. Conclusion: The majority of vascular assessments currently performed by podiatrists in the UK are inconsistent with UK or international vascular guidelines and recommendations. Despite this, most podiatrists felt confident in diagnosing, referring and managing patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD), however many felt they needed more education to feel confident to assist patients with PAD to manage their cardiovascular risk factors. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Ankle-brachial index; Doppler; Non-invasive vascular assessment; Podiatrist; Survey; Toe systolic pressure; Toe-brachial index,"ankle brachial index; cross-sectional study; diabetic angiopathy; Doppler ultrasonography; education; educational status; health care survey; human; lower limb; patient education; peripheral occlusive artery disease; podiatry; procedures; professional practice; professional standard; United Kingdom; vascularization; Ankle Brachial Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetic Angiopathies; Educational Status; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Lower Extremity; Patient Education as Topic; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Podiatry; Professional Practice; Professional Role; Ultrasonography, Doppler; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85067127504

The present study was aimed to get an insight of viewpoints of all members involved in progression of events from prescription to drug purchase, i.e., physician, patient and medical-store personals regarding the prescription pattern in Pakistan. Methods: Therefore, a cross-sectional study was conducted in four provinces and capital territory (Islamabad) of Pakistan to evaluate the perception of physicians, patients and medical stores/pharmacy personnel of the prescribing trends in Pakistan. Results: Response rate was higher from Punjab and lower in Sindh. Responses of 981 walk-in patients with 393 physicians and 618 medical stores/pharmacies were received and statistically evaluated. The majority of physicians, patients and pharmacists/medical store personnel considered the medicines of multinational manufacturers as more effective. Physicians considered their prescribing cost-effective. However, majority of patients as well as pharmacists/medical store personnel strongly disagreed or disagreed with this notion that physicians prescribe cheap medicines. Furthermore, physicians and patients reported that medicines of local companies were not as effective as the medicines of multinational manufacturers, which were contrary to what pharmacists thought. Majority of physicians disagreed that their prescribing was under the influence of medical stores in their vicinity. The response of most of the patients (40.5%) was in line with that of physicians whereas 32% pharmacist/medical store personnel agreed. Nearly half of the physicians strongly agreed or agreed that patients demand medicines of multinational companies. Contrarily, a majority of patients and medical store personnel denied that patients demand for the medicines of multinational manufacturers.

Objectives: To compare socioeconomic inequalities in problematic adolescent substance use (regular smoking, heavy episodic drinking, and cannabis use) across 24 European countries at two time points. Methods: We use the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs (ESPAD) to examine socioeconomic inequalities in problematic adolescent substance use across 24 European countries in 2007 (n = 73,877) and 2011 (n = 71,060) using within country logistic regressions. Socioeconomic inequalities are measured using a relative index of inequality based on highest level of parental education relative to country of residence within survey year. Countries are ranked according to socioeconomic differentials. Results: In 2007, lower socioeconomic status (SES) adolescents had significantly higher odds of heavy episodic drinking in 10 countries, regular smoking in 12 countries, and recent cannabis use in 1 country. In 2011, the number of countries were 11, 15, and 0, respectively. In 2007, lower SES adolescents had a significantly lower odds of heavy episodic drinking in one country, regular smoking in one country, and cannabis use in four countries. In 2011, the number of countries were two, one, and six, respectively. There was little evidence for changes in socioeconomic inequalities over time.

Young adults (n = 270, 21 ± 1 years, 53.3% female) were assessed for MetSyn and self-reported parent’s CRF, body mass status, and disease status. MetSyn was present in 11.9% of participants, 27.4% had one or two components, and 58.5% had no components. A significantly higher percentage (93.9%) of young adults with MetSyn identified at least one parent as being overweight or obese, 84.8% reported low parental CRF and 87.9% reported a parent with disease (all p < 0.017). MetSyn in offspring is more likely when parents are perceived to have low CRF, increased body mass, and a diagnosis of disease. Evaluating the offspring of people with low CRF, elevated body mass, or who have a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes should be considered to promote early identification and treatment of young adults to reduce future premature CVD in these at-risk individuals. ? 2019 by the authors.

Their capacity to consume or transform contaminants leads to contrasting outcomes, such as the dissipation of nutrient pollution via denitrification, the breakdown of spilled oil, or eutrophication via primary producer overgrowth. Recovering the genomes of organisms directly from the environment is useful to gain insights into resource usage, in-terspecies collaborations (producers and consumers), and trait acquisition. Microbial data can also be considered alongside the broader biological character of an environment through the co-recovery of eukaryotic DNA. The contributions of individual microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, and protists) to snapshots of ecosystem processes can be determined by integrating genomics with functional methods. This combined approach enables a detailed understanding of how microbial communities drive biogeochemical cycles, and although currently limited by scale, key attributes can be effectively extrapolated with lower-resolution methods to determine wider ecological relevance.

We evaluated the overall impact of CRT on recurrent hospitalisations and survival in real-world patients with HF. Design Retrospective observational study. Setting Northern region of New Zealand. Participants Patients with HF who underwent CRT device implantation in between 2008 and 2014 were followed up for 1 year. Interventions CRT. Primary and secondary outcomes measured Survival, all-cause hospitalisations, length of stay, from which days alive and out of hospital (DAOH) were calculated. Results 177patients were included, of whom eight died (4.5%) within 1 year of follow-up. Pre-CRT implantation, 83% of all patients had been hospitalised for a total 248 hospitalisation events. Following CRT, 47 patients (27%) were readmitted to hospital within 1 year (total of 98 admissions; p<0.01 compared with pre-device implant). Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter than in the year prior to CRT implantation at a median of 4 (IQR 2-6) vs 7 (IQR 3.5-10.5) days (p=0.03). An increase in the median number of DAOH was observed from 362 (IQR 355-364) to 365 (IQR 364-365) (p<0.01) after CRT implant. The improvement in DAOH was seen regardless of gender and type of CRT devices. Greater DAOH was also seen in those with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and Caucasians. Conclusion After CRT implant, patients with HF have greater DAOH with reduction of total hospitalisation and fewer hospital days. These results support CRT devices use as a treatment option for appropriate HF patients. DAOH represents an easily measured, patient-centred endpoint that may reflect effectiveness of interventions in future CRT studies. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Method: Data were extracted for 121 adults who experienced a mTBI and completed the Emotion Evaluation and Social Inference Enriched tests of The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT) 4 years postinjury. To identify early indicators of outcome, responses to the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire, and CNS Vital Signs neurocognitive assessment conducted 1 month postinjury were also extracted. Social cognition scores were compared to age-matched TASIT norms (N-121). Results: The mTBI group was significantly less able to interpret what people say and intend than norms, although the effect sizes were small (d = 0.43). There were 24.8% of people 4 years postmTBI and 9.9% of norms who experienced at least mild impairment in social inference. There were no significant differences between the mTBI group and norms for emotion evaluation. Poorer social inference 4 years after mTBI was significantly associated with lower cognitive flexibility and executive function (F = 2.57, df = 13,26, p = .02). Group differences remained after controlling for cognitive functioning (F = 104.59, df = 1,58, p = .001. Conclusions: These novel results suggest that adults postmTBI may experience social inference difficulties 4 years post-TBI that are not completely explained by cognitive difficulties.

Methods: Participants with RA were recruited from rheumatology clinics in NZ and invited to receive and reply to surveys administered via the Patient Opinion Real-Time Anonymous Liaison (PORTAL) system. An enrolment survey recorded demographics, disease duration and treatment and then RA T2T surveys were administered weekly. A Likert scale 1-5 measured agreement with the principles and recommendations and further surveys explored responses of interest identified by investigators from each prior survey. Results: One hundred and ninety patients consented to participate in PORTAL and 132 in the RA T2T surveys. Level of agreement with RA T2T principles was: 93.3% to 99.3% and to the recommendations: 77.3%-100%. The lowest level of agreement 77.3% was with recommendation 8, 3 monthly treatment adjustment, and the highest was 100% agreement with recommendation 10, shared decision-making. Patients agreed less with low disease activity as the target compared with remission (91.4% and 98%). Despite high-level agreement for the use of a disease activity score (95.7%), 23% did not feel the individual components reflected their disease control. Patients rated difficulty coping, erosions on imaging, health-related quality of life and pain all significantly higher than C-reactive protein as indicators of worsening arthritis. Conclusions: Despite a high level of patient agreement with RA T2T this study highlights the importance of patient engagement in the RA T2T process to individualize therapy adjustments, make shared decisions and decide on targets that accurately reflect disease control according to patients. ? 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",rheumatoid arthritis; shared decision making; treat-to-target,"C reactive protein; antirheumatic agent; adult; Article; cohort analysis; coping behavior; demography; disease activity score; disease control; disease duration; disease severity; female; health survey; human; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; middle aged; New Zealand; online system; patient attitude; patient compliance; pilot study; priority journal; quality of life; remission; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatology; shared decision making; treatment duration; aged; cost of illness; disease exacerbation; health care survey; nociception; patient participation; patient satisfaction; patient-reported outcome; practice guideline; psychology; rheumatoid arthritis; time factor; treatment outcome; Adaptation, Psychological; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cost of Illness; Disease Progression; Female; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; Pain Perception; Patient Participation; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient Satisfaction; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality of Life; Remission Induction; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85061969029

A wide variation in phenotype has been recognized, even within families carrying the same mutation. In addition, aspects of the natural history of the disorder, in particular whether it is always progressive or can remit spontaneously, remain uncertain. In a large kindred carrying a TGFB1 gene mutation (c.653G > A; p.R218H) we have attempted to clarify the extent of phenotypic variability and the natural history of the disease through detailed individual histories of symptoms, and skeletal imaging by both radiography and scintigraphy. Only one subject had the classical childhood onset with bone pain in the legs and gait disturbance. Eight subjects reported the onset of leg pain in their teenage years that, by their early 20s, had either resolved or persisted at a low level. Two of these eight later developed cranial nerve palsies. There was a wide variation in the radiographic appearance in adults, but disease extent and activity in long bones, as assessed by scintigraphy, was inversely correlated with age (p < 0.025). In younger subjects the radiographic and scintigraphic appearances were concordant, but in older subjects the scintigram could be quiescent despite florid radiographic changes. Sequential scintigrams in two subjects showed reduced activity in the later scan. One subject had suffered meningoencephalitis in early childhood that resulted in paresis of one arm. The affected arm showed markedly less disease involvement, implicating mechanical or growth factors in its etiology. Our data suggest that the natural history of Camurati-Engelmann disease can be benign, and that disease activity commonly attenuates in adulthood. Severe cases of childhood onset and/or with cranial nerve involvement, may occur only in a minority of mutation carriers. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research",BMPS/TGF-BETA; CELL/TISSUE SIGNALING; DISEASES AND DISORDERS OF/RELATED TO BONE; GENETIC RESEARCH; HUMAN ASSOCIATION STUDIES; OTHER; PARACRINE PATHWAYS,losartan; prednisone; adolescent; adult; adulthood; age; Article; bone scintiscanning; Camurati Engelmann disease; child; clinical article; cranial nerve paralysis; decompression surgery; disease activity; female; headache; hearing impairment; human; leg pain; long bone; male; meningoencephalitis; middle aged; muscle twitch; muscle weakness; osteoarthritis; paresthesia; pedigree analysis; preschool child; vestibulocochlear nerve; visual impairment; young adult,2-s2.0-85061922066

The addition of polysialic acid (PSA), a post-translational modification (PTM) almost exclusively carried by NCAM, alters NCAM properties and functions and is therefore tightly regulated. Changes in NCAM and PSA-NCAM take place during development and ageing and occur in various diseases. The presence of PTMs can reduce the accessibility of antibodies to their epitopes and lead to false negative results. Thus, it is vital to identify antibodies that can specifically detect their target regardless of the presence of PTMs. In the present study, four commercially available NCAM antibodies were characterized by western blot and immunocytochemistry. Antibody specificity was determined by decreasing NCAM expression with small interfering RNA and subsequently determining whether the antibodies still produced a signal. In addition, PSA was digested with endoneuraminidase N to assess whether removing PSA improves NCAM detection with these antibodies. Our study revealed that the presence of PSA on NCAM reduced antibody accessibility to the epitope and consequently masked NCAM antigenicity for both techniques investigated. Moreover, three of the four antibodies tested were specific for the detection of NCAM by western blot and by immunocytochemistry. Altogether, this study demonstrates the importance of choosing the correct antibody to study NCAM depending on the technique of interest and underlines the importance of taking PTMs into account when using antibody-based techniques for the study of NCAM. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Antibodies; endoN; Endoneuraminidase; Immunocytochemistry; PSA-NCAM; Western blot,nerve cell adhesion molecule; polysialic acid; small interfering RNA; antibody specificity; antigenicity; Article; cell count; cell lysate; cell surface; controlled study; gene expression; human; human cell; immunocytochemistry; molecular weight; priority journal; protein processing; TE 671 cell line; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85059514040

Shorter telomere length has in turn been linked with accelerated ageing and with age-related diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association between pregnancy and birth factors and relative telomere length in offspring at 11 years of age. Methods: Participants were aged 11 years enrolled in the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study at birth (n = 380). Half of the children were born small for gestational age (SGA = birthweight ? 10th percentile) and half were appropriate for gestational age (AGA = birthweight > 10th percentile). Maternal stress during pregnancy was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. Relative leukocyte telomere length (RTL) in leukocytes was measured at 11 years of age using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: RTL was normally distributed (mean = 3.78, SD = 1.05). There were no significant associations between RTL at age 11 years and birthweight, sex, maternal smoking, maternal stress during pregnancy or maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index.

Metformin has proven benefits in the general population and might be advantageous in the prevention and management of PTDM. Methods: Transplantation and Diabetes (Transdiab) is a single-centre, unblinded, pilot randomised controlled trial assessing the feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of metformin after renal transplantation in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Participants had an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the 4-12 weeks post-transplantation; those with IGT were randomised to standard care or standard care and metformin 500 mg twice daily and followed up for 12 months. Results: Seventy eight patients had an OGTT over 24 months, 25 of them had IGT, of those, 19 patients were randomised, giving a feasibility of recruitment of 24.4%. Ten patients were randomised to metformin and 9 patients to standard care. Tolerability and efficacy was similar between the 2 groups with no serious adverse events. There was no difference in secondary outcomes relating to the metabolic profile. Conclusions: The use of metformin post renal transplantation appeared feasible and safe. Larger randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are needed to establish and confirm the efficacy and safety of metformin post renal transplantation.

Almost all consultants report generally positive attitudes towards mental health problems. However, we identified several obstacles towards management. First, there was a discrepancy between positive attitude and the willingness to take on management responsibility. Reported reasons for this discrepancy were time constraints and lack of skills. We also found that consultants feel little responsibility for the management of depression and chronic drinking. Physicians have generally more positive attitudes than surgeons. Finally, all consultants are less likely to refer patients with dementia and treatment non-compliance to psychiatry, for reasons of perceived ineffectiveness and fear of stigmatizing patients. We conclude targeted education on the management of these problems for hospital consultants is still warranted. ? 2018, ? 2018 The Author(s).

Post-concussive symptoms may persist, and are common in the general population, so determining if the factor structure in mild-TBI and controls differ is important. This study examined factor structure of the RPQ in adults 4 years post-mild-TBI and in age-/gender-matched controls. Method: A total of?232 adults 4 years post-mild-TBI and 232 age-/gender-matched controls completed the RPQ. Results: Both samples produced a three-factor solution (57.98% and 56.44% of variance in the RPQ). Factor 1 for both samples included all RPQ items and accounted for the majority of variance explained (42.6% and 40.7%). After mild-TBI factor 2 included dizziness, vomiting/nausea, irritability, and double vision; whilst in controls it involved headache, dizziness, vomiting/nausea, and slowed thinking. Factor 3 for mild-TBI included vomiting/nausea, blurred vision, slowed thinking, and poor memory; while for controls it was restricted to visual symptoms (blurred vision, light sensitivity, double vision). Conclusion: The RPQ factor structure was similar for both groups, although differences were identified in lesser factors. This suggests those with mild-TBI differ minimally from matched controls in the very long term after injury. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Factor structure; Post concussion; Rivermead Post Concussion Symptom questionnaire,adult; age; Article; controlled study; diplopia; disease duration; dizziness; female; gender; headache; human; irritability; major clinical study; male; memory disorder; nausea and vomiting; postconcussion syndrome; questionnaire; rivermead post concussion symptom questionnaire; traumatic brain injury,2-s2.0-85060791727

Due to known discordance with patient reports, proxies are often not recommended in clinical trials; however, proxies may be needed in certain research contexts. We aimed to identify and describe trials registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) with proxy-reported endpoints. Methods: ANZCTR was systematically searched from inception (2005) to 31 March 2017 for trials with proxy-reported endpoints. Primary and secondary endpoints for each trial retrieved by the search were individually coded (proxy-reported: yes/no), and trials with confirmed proxy-reported endpoints were included in the analysis. Results: Of 13,666 registered trials, 469 (3.4%) included a proxy-reported endpoint (867 individual proxy-reported endpoints in total: 62% family member proxy, 22% health professional). Proxy endpoint inclusion did not significantly increase over time (r = 0.18, p = 0.59). Mental health (11.5%), stroke (10.3%) and neurological (8.3%) trials had the highest proportion of trials using proxies. Of the 469 trials, 123 (26.2%) studies involved paediatric patients.

In this article, we develop a spatial point process approach to describe patterns in cell distribution within tissue samples taken from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. In particular, our approach is centered on the Palm intensity function. This leads to taking an approximate-likelihood technique in fitting point processes models. We consider two Neyman-Scott point processes and a void process, fitting these point process models to the CRC patient data. We find that the parameter estimates of these models may be used to quantify the spatial arrangement of cells. Importantly, we observe characteristic differences in the spatial arrangement of cells between patients who died from CRC and those alive at follow up. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",colorectal cancer; Palm intensity function; spatial point patterns,Article; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; colon cancer; controlled study; human; mathematical computing; mathematical model; point pattern analysis; spatial analysis; statistical analysis; statistical model; survival analysis,2-s2.0-85057547234

Results: Drawing from 12 systematic reviews, supplemented by additional studies identified by experts and colleagues, we identified a test set of 11 studies that met our eligibility criteria. We assigned five studies to a development set, which we used to develop and refine our search strategy. We assigned the remaining six studies to a validation set, against which we tested our final search strategy. The final search strategy identified all studies in both validation and development sets.

Herein we determined if SHON expression detected by specific monoclonal antibodies could provide a more accurate prediction and serve as a biomarker for anthracycline-based combination chemotherapy (ACT). Methods: SHON expression was determined by immunohistochemistry in the Nottingham early-stage-BC cohort (n = 1,650) who, if eligible, received adjuvant tamoxifen; the Nottingham ERα ? early-stage-BC (n?=?697) patients who received adjuvant ACT; and the Nottingham locally advanced-BC cohort who received pre-operative ACT with/without taxanes (Neo-ACT, n?=?120) and if eligible, 5-year adjuvant tamoxifen treatment. Prognostic significance of SHON and its relationship with the clinical outcome of treatments were analysed. Results: As previously reported, SHON-Nuc + in high risk/ERα + patients was significantly associated with a 48% death risk reduction after exclusive adjuvant tamoxifen treatment compared with SHON-Nuc ? [HR (95%?CI) = 0.52 (0.34–0.78), p?=?0.002]. Meanwhile, in ERα ? patients treated with adjuvant ACT, SHON cytoplasmic expression (SHON-Cyto + ) was significantly associated with a 50% death risk reduction compared with SHON-Cyto ? [HR (95%?CI) = 0.50 (0.34–0.73), p = 0.0003]. Moreover, in patients received Neo-ACT, SHON-Nuc ? or SHON-Cyto + was associated with an increased pathological complete response (pCR) compared with SHON-Nuc + [21 vs 4%; OR (95%?CI) = 5.88 (1.28–27.03), p = 0.012], or SHON-Cyto ? [20.5 vs. 4.5%; OR (95%?CI) = 5.43 (1.18–25.03), p = 0.017], respectively. After receiving Neo-ACT, patients with SHON-Nuc + had a significantly lower distant relapse risk compared to those with SHON-Nuc ? [HR (95%?CI) = 0.41 (0.19–0.87), p = 0.038], whereas SHON-Cyto + patients had a significantly higher distant relapse risk compared to SHON-Cyto ? patients [HR (95%?CI) = 4.63 (1.05–20.39), p?=?0.043]. Furthermore, multivariate Cox regression analyses revealed that SHON-Cyto + was independently associated with a higher risk of distant relapse after Neo-ACT and 5-year tamoxifen treatment [HR (95%?CI) = 5.08 (1.13–44.52), p = 0.037]. The interaction term between ERα status and SHON-Nuc + (p?=?0.005), and between SHON-Nuc + and tamoxifen therapy (p = 0.007), were both statistically significant.

This is concerning, given that up to 90% of obese 3-year-old children are overweight or obese by the time they reach adolescence. Interventions that target this age range often fail to demonstrate long-term effectiveness and primarily focus on traditional weight-related behaviors, including diet and physical activity. However, research suggests that targeting nontraditional weight-related behaviors, such as sleep, screen time, and family meals, may be a more effective approach in this age group, given the immense challenges in changing traditional weight-related behaviors in the long term. Objective: The aim of the proposed study was to develop and pilot the 3 Pillars Study (3PS), a 6-week program for parents of New Zealand toddlers and preschoolers aged 2 to 4 years to promote positive parent-child interactions during 3 family routines, specifically adequate sleep, regular family meals, and restricted screen time. Methods: Screen time at the end of the 6-week program is the primary endpoint. The effects of the program on screen time, frequency of family meals, parent feeding practices, diet quality, and sleep duration will be piloted using a randomized controlled trial, with outcomes compared between the active intervention group and a wait-list control group at 6 weeks (at the end of the program) and 12 weeks (at final follow-up). We aim to recruit 50 participants (25 per arm). Eligibility criteria include parents of children aged 2 to 4 years who are currently exceeding screen use recommendations (ie, greater than 1 hour of screen time per day). The 3PS program involves a half-day workshop, run by a community worker trained to deliver the program content, and 6-week access to a study website that contains in-depth information about the program. All participants will also receive a study pack, which includes resources to encourage engagement in the 3 family routines promoted by the program. Study data will be collected in REDCap. All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 and have been specified a priori in a statistical analysis plan prepared by the study statistician. Results: Trial recruitment opened in July 2018. Final follow-up was completed in December 2018, with trial findings expected to be available in early 2019. Conclusions: Findings from this pilot study will provide relevant data to inform the design of a larger effectiveness study of the 3PS program. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

This paper provides an example of how an evaluation evolved alongside such an initiative designed to better integrate care across primary, community and hospital services in South Auckland, New Zealand. Theory and methods: Using the explanatory power of a realist evaluative approach, theories of new ways of working that might be prompted by the initiative were explored in: (i) interviews with stakeholders in 2012 and 2015, (ii) online surveys of general practices and local care organisations, and (iii) a purposive sample of ten general practices. Results: The results highlighted the institutional contexts that led to difficulties in implementing population health initiatives. They also revealed that changes in work practices focussed mostly on activities that improved the coordination of care for individuals at risk of hospital admissions. Discussion: Multi-component complex interventions can vary in their delivery and be vulnerable to one or more components not being implemented as originally intended. In the case of this intervention, the move towards strengthening local relationships arose when contractual arrangements stalled. Realist evaluative approaches offer a logic that helps unpick the complexity of the relationships and politics in play, and uncover the assumptions made by those developing, implementing and assessing health service changes. Conclusion: Given the multi-component and evolving nature of initiatives seeking to better integrate care, the realist evaluative emphasis on surfacing early the theories to explain how change is expected to occur helps overcome the challenge of evaluating “a moving targetA.. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Integrated care; Local networks; New zealand; Realist evaluation,adult; article; coordination; general practice; hospital admission; hospital service; human; interview; logic; New Zealand; organization; population health; purposive sample; theoretical study,2-s2.0-85065976200

In humans, an association has been found between obesity and gut microbiome dysbiosis. However, gut microbiome transfer has not been evaluated for the treatment of human obesity. We will examine the effectiveness of gut microbiome transfer using encapsulated material for the treatment of obesity in adolescents. Methods and analysis A two-arm, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised clinical trial of a single course of gut microbiome transfer will be conducted in 80 obese [body mass index (BMI) ?30 kg/m 2 ] adolescents (males and females, aged 14-18 years) in Auckland, New Zealand. Healthy lean donors (males and females, aged 18-28 years) will provide fresh stool samples from which bacteria will be isolated and double encapsulated. Participants (recipients) will be randomised at 1:1 to control (placebo) or treatment (gut microbiome transfer), stratified by sex. Recipients will receive 28 capsules over two consecutive mornings (?14 mL of frozen microbial suspension or saline). Clinical assessments will be performed at baseline, 6, 12 and 26 weeks, and will include: anthropometry, blood pressure, fasting metabolic markers, dietary intake, physical activity levels and health-related quality of life. Insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), gut microbiota population structure characterised by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing and body composition (using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12 and 26 weeks. 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring will be performed at baseline and at 6 weeks. The primary outcome is BMI SD scores (SDS) at 6 weeks, with BMI SDS at 12 and 26 weeks as secondary outcomes. Other secondary outcomes include insulin sensitivity, adiposity (total body fat percentage) and gut microbial composition at 6, 12 and 26 weeks. Statistical analysis will be performed on the principle of intention to treat. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval was provided by the Northern A Health and Disability Ethics Committee (Ministry of Health, New Zealand; 16/NTA/172).

Studies using IVCM have provided insight into the effects of contact lens wear on corneal Langerhans cell density and morphology, and the effects of eye drops on conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue. IVCM has also been shown to be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in distinguishing infective and non-infective uveitis and in diagnosing atypical infective keratitis. In the research setting, this technology has enhanced our understanding of the role of inflammatory cells in corneal neuropathy and angiogenesis. In vivo-ex vivo correlation using animal models has helped overcome some of the difficulties in identifying cell type on IVCM images.

A gait analysis was conducted on ten children with CP, on two occasions. Lower limb joint kinematics computed from the Kinect and a traditional marker-based Motion Analysis system were investigated by calculating the root mean square errors (RMSE), the coefficients of multiple correlation (CMC), and the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC2,k). Results showed that the Kinect-based kinematics had an overall modest to poor correlation (CMC—less than 0.001 to 0.70) and an angle pattern similarity with Motion Analysis. After the calibration, RMSE on every degree of freedom decreased. The two calibration methods indicated similar levels of improvement in hip sagittal (CMC—0.81 ± 0.10 vs. 0.75 ± 0.22)/frontal (CMC—0.41 ± 0.35 vs. 0.42 ± 0.37) and knee sagittal kinematics (CMC—0.85±0.07 vs. 0.87 ± 0.12). The hip sagittal (CMC—0.97±0.05) and knee sagittal (CMC—0.88 ± 0.12) angle patterns showed a very good agreement over two days. Modest to excellent reliability (ICC2,k—0.45 to 0.93) for most parameters renders it feasible for observing ongoing changes in gait kinematics. ? 2019 by the authors.

In this study, we evaluated the effects of GSK3-β inhibition on lung lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro. Pharmacological inhibition and silencing of GSK3-β resulted in increased lymphangiogenesis of lung lymphatic endothelial cells. To investigate mechanisms of GSK3-β-mediated lymphangiogenesis, we interrogated the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway and found that inhibition of GSK3-β resulted in PTEN activation and subsequent decreased activation of AKT, leading to decreased p-P70S6kinase levels, indicating inhibition of the mTOR pathway. In addition, consistent with a negative role of GSK3-β in β-catenin stability through protein phosphorylation, we found that GSK3-β inhibition resulted in an increase in β-catenin levels. Simultaneous silencing of β-catenin and inhibition of GSK3-β demonstrated that β-catenin is required for GSK3-β-induced lymphangiogenesis. ? 2019 Stump et al.

In this pre-specified analysis, we examined the impact of extended hours haemodialysis on sleep quality. Methods: The ACTIVE Dialysis trial randomized 200 participants to extended (?24 h/week) or standard (target 12–15 h) hours haemodialysis over 12 months. Sleep quality was measured in the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 1.3 (KDQOL-SF) by overall sleep quality score (0–10, 10 = ‘very good’) and the sleep subscale (0–100, 100 = ‘best possible sleep’) every 3 months via blinded telephone interview. The average intervention effect was calculated by mixed linear regression adjusted by time point and baseline score. Factors predicting sleep quality were assessed by multivariate regression analysis. Results: Overall sleep quality score and sleep subscale at baseline were similar in both groups (5.9 [95%CI 5.4–6.4] vs. 6.3 [5.9–6.8]; 65.0 [60.9–69.1] vs. 63.2 [59.1–67.3]; extended and standard hours, respectively). Extended hours haemodialysis led to a non-significant improvement in overall sleep quality score (average intervention effect 0.44 (?0.01 to 0.89), P = 0.053) and sleep subscale (average intervention effect 3.58 (?0.02 to 7.18), P = 0.051). Poor sleep quality was associated with being female and with current smoking. Sleep quality was positively associated with EuroQol-5D (EQ5D) and the SF-36 Physical Component and Mental Component Summary Scores but not with hospitalizations. Conclusion: Sleep quality was not significantly improved by extended hours dialysis in this study.

Typically, these targets are presented as percentiles of patients to be seen within specified timeframes. These targets present hospital administrators with a resourcing problem complicated by conflicting objectives: How to minimize costs while maximizing throughput to achieve the performance targets? In this paper, we describe the use of a simulation model to evaluate the effect of changes to staff levels in a cytology department, investigating the trade-off between staff levels and turnaround times in light of performance targets specified by government. Standard practice for determining staffing levels in a cytology department uses average workload estimates and does not take into account target performance measures, task variability, and the interruptive nature of the workload of pathologists. We develop a simulation model for pathologist workload within a cytology department in New Zealand. We describe the model construction process that follows the hierarchical control conceptual modeling (HCCM) framework. We use the resulting simulation model to examine the trade-offs between staffing levels (and associated rosters) and task turnaround time. The results indicate that consideration of variation in task arrivals is important when considering the effect of staffing levels on turnaround time. Furthermore, as the cytology department is required to meet performance targets that involve maximum service times for a percentile of patients, such an approach is necessary in order to estimate the performance level of a staffing roster. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",discrete event simulation; performance targets; resource planning; staffing levels; trade-offs,"cytology; government; laboratory method; modeling; pathology; planning process; simulation; trade-off; adult; article; cytology; government; human; New Zealand; pathologist; simulation; staff; turnaround time; workload; hospital department; nonbiological model; organization and management; theoretical model; New Zealand; Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Models, Organizational; Models, Theoretical; New Zealand; Pathology Department, Hospital; Workforce; Workload",2-s2.0-85061235371

Delirium is associated with increased mortality, ongoing impairment in cognitive functioning, and a high possibility of discharge to residential care. The experience of delirium may be distressing for the patient and their family. Despite the frequency of delirium in hospitalized elderly patients, there is a dearth of literature that examines their experience of this phenomenon, and how it affects individuals as they continue their lives. This study uses descriptive qualitative methodology to explore the question: ‘What is the experience of delirium for older adults during hospitalisation?’ Data were collected from older adults who had received hospital care in a tertiary general hospital setting. Seven participants were recruited between January and June 2017. Semi-structured individual interviews were used to gather data which was analysed using content analysis. Four themes were identified. These were sense of confusion, disrupted sense of autonomy, perceptual disturbances, and emotional response. Participants exercised agency in the way they responded to these experiences. The study highlighted the need for delirium prevention, and education to improve nurses’ recognition, understanding, and management of delirium. In particular, there is a need for nurses to attend to the psychological and emotional experience of delirium. ? 2018 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.",delirium; general hospital; nursing; older adult; subjective experience,"aged; confusion; delirium; emotion; female; human; interview; male; middle aged; personal autonomy; psychology; sensory dysfunction; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Confusion; Delirium; Emotions; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Autonomy; Sensation Disorders",2-s2.0-85058464396

Innovative nursing models of care could achieve these targets with cancer patients, who often present to emergency departments with treatment-related toxicities and poorly-managed symptoms. Aim: To investigate whether national emergency access-like targets are achievable with interventions led by Advanced Practice Cancer Nurses when cancer patients attend Emergency Departments. Method: Authors searched electronic databases CINHAL, MEDLINE and Cochrane to July 2016. Outcomes included length of stay, adverse events, patient satisfaction, and cost effectiveness. Two reviewers independently conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment using standard Cochrane methodology. Results: Of the 579 titles retrieved, six randomised control trials met identified eligibility criteria. Nurse-led interventions significantly reduced emergency departments’ length of stay in two studies and improved patient satisfaction in two studies without affecting mortality, readmission and re-examination. Cost data could not be translated to the Australian context because of different salary scales and funding models. Discussion: This review did not identify investigations of any nurse-led interventions to improve national emergency access-like targets in presenting cancer patients. While it is unclear if Advanced Practice Cancer Nurses can treat cancer patients more efficiently as standard care, there is some indication that Advanced Practice Cancer Nurses might be able to deliver improved length of stay for cancer patients in emergency departments. Conclusion: Rigorous research is needed to implement and evaluate this role at the interface of the emergency departments and the cancer setting. ? 2018",Advanced practice nurse; Cancer; Conceptual models of nursing; Emergency department; Quality of care; Systematic reviews,,2-s2.0-85053168903

Methods: Medline, CINAHL, Sports-Discus, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to January 2018. Studies reporting foot- and ankle-related outcomes in the following domains were included: vascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, cutaneous (skin and nail) or pain/function. The Quality Index tool was used to assess methodological quality. Where appropriate, odds ratio (OR) and mean difference meta-analyses were conducted for case-control studies; and pooled mean prevalence meta-analyses for studies assessing characteristics in SLE. Results: Forty-nine studies were included with mean (range) quality scores of 75% (38–100%). Twenty-three studies assessed vascular characteristics, followed by musculoskeletal (n = 16), neurological (n = 11), cutaneous (n = 5) and pain/function (n = 4). Foot and ankle characteristics in people with SLE included impaired vascular supply, abnormal nerve function, musculoskeletal pathology, skin and nail pathology, and pain and functional disability. Twenty-four studies were included in meta-analyses. Pooled OR for abnormal ankle brachial index was 3.08 for SLE compared with controls. Pooled mean difference in brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity between SLE and controls was significant (161.39 cm/s, P = 0.004). Pooled prevalence was 0.54 for intermittent claudication, 0.50 for Raynaud's phenomenon, 0.28 for chilblains, 0.00 for gangrene, 0.30 for hallux valgus, 0.15 for onychomycosis, 0.76 for history of foot pain, and 0.36 for current foot pain.

Doolette D.J.,7004836865;,Gas micronuclei that underlie decompression bubbles and decompression sickness have not been identified,2019,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85062869789&doi=10.28920%2fdhm49.1.64&partnerID=40&md5=d926930149744373709c06ed6fee941c,"Gas micronuclei are gas-filled voids in liquids from which bubbles can form at low gas supersaturation. If water is depleted of gas micronuclei, high gas supersaturation is required for bubble formation. This high gas supersaturation is required in part to overcome the Laplace pressure at the point of transition from dissolved gas to a bubble of perhaps nanometer-scale radius. The sum of gas and vapour partial pressures inside a spherical bubble (Pbub) of radius r exceeds the ambient barometric pressure (Pamb) and is given by the Young-LaPlace equation: Pbub = Pamb + 2γ/r for a bubble not in contact with a solid surface. The second term on the right-hand side is the Laplace pressure across the gas-liquid interface due to surface tension (γ). For instance, for a surface tension characteristic of blood of 0.056 N·m??, de novo formation of a bubble of r = 10 nm requires gas supersaturation exceeding 2γ/r = 11.2 MPa. However, in humans, detectable venous gas bubbles follow decompression to sea level from as shallow as 138 kPa air saturation, implying gas supersaturation of only a few kPa are required for decompression bubble formation. It is widely accepted that bubbles that form at such low gas supersaturation grow from pre-existing, micron-scale gas micronuclei. For such gas micronuclei to already exist prior to gas supersaturation they cannot simply be small bubbles because positive feedback of Laplace pressure causes a micron radius bubble to dissolve in a fraction of a second. Theoretical candidates for gas micronuclei are bubbles coated in surfactants that counteract the Laplace pressure or crevices where gas voids assume shapes that negate the Laplace pressure. However, to date, the nature of gas micronuclei that underly decompression-induced bubbles and decompression sickness have yet to be identified. Consequently, I was intrigued that in two previous issues of Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine (2018 Volume 48, Issue 2, page 114 and Issue 3, page 197), letters from Ran Arieli to the Editor hypothesized a mechanism for decompression bubble formation in blood vessels and in the skin. Both letters stated ""It is known that nanobubbles form spontaneously when a smooth hydrophobic surface is submerged in water containing dissolved gas. We have shown that nanobubbles are the gas micronuclei underlying decompression bubbles and decompression sickness"". Surface nanobubbles have been extensively described in the physical chemistry literature, but the second sentence is supported by citation of an hypothesis article. The latter is based on experimental work (referenced therein) in which sections of large blood vessels from sheep were incubated in saline and compressed to 1.013 MPa for 18 hours then rapidly decompressed to the surface, whereupon macroscopic bubbles were photographed forming on the luminal surface of the vessels. The authors speculate that the bubbles were forming from surface nanobubbles on the vessel lumen, but no experimental or analytical evidence was presented that surface nanobubbles were present on the vessel lumen or were the precursors of the observed macroscopic bubbles. Surface nanobubbles form on atomically smooth, hard surfaces in gas supersaturated liquids and, imaged with atomic force microscopy, appear as spherical caps of gas. As far as I can determine, surface nanobubbles have not been reported on biological tissue surfaces. Surface nanobubbles typically have diameters less than 100 nanometers but have lifetimes that are orders of magnitude longer than would a bubble of similar dimensions. Surface nanobubbles do not grow into macroscopic bubbles when exposed to pressure waves sufficient to cause bubble formation from adventitious gas micronuclei elsewhere in the apparatus. This is surely not the last word in this new and active field of research into nanoscopic gas species; however, based on current evidence one must treat with skepticism speculation that unobserved surface nanobubbles are the gas micronuclei from which bubbles form in humans with low gas supersaturation and which underlie decompression sickness.

Soda lime has a finite ability to absorb CO?. Temperature sticks monitor the exothermic reaction between CO? and soda lime to predict remaining absorptive capacity. The accuracy of these predictions was investigated in two rebreathers that utilise temperature sticks. METHODS: Inspiration and rEvo rebreathers filled with new soda lime were immersed in water at 19°C and operated on mechanical circuits whose ventilation and CO?-addition parameters simulated dives involving either moderate exercise (6 MET) throughout (mod-ex), or 90 minutes of 6 MET exercise followed by 2 MET exercise (low-ex) until breakthrough (inspired PCO? [PiCO?] = 1 kPa). Simulated dives were conducted at surface pressure (sea-level) (low-ex: Inspiration, n = 5; rEvo, n = 5; mod-ex: Inspiration, n = 7, rEvo, n = 5) and at 3-6 metres' sea water (msw) depth (mod-ex protocol only: Inspiration, n = 8; rEvo, n = 5). RESULTS: Operated at surface pressure, both rebreathers warned appropriately in four of five low-ex tests but failed to do so in the 12 mod-ex tests. At 3-6 msw depth, warnings preceded breakthrough in 11 of 13 mod-ex tests. The rEvo warned conservatively in all five tests (approximately 60 minutes prior). Inspiration warnings immediately preceded breakthrough in six of eight tests, but were marginally late in one test and 13 minutes late in another. CONCLUSION: When operated at even shallow depth, temperature sticks provided timely warning of significant CO? breakthrough in the scenarios examined. They are much less accurate during simulated exercise at surface pressure.

METHODS: A purposeful sample of 33 children (11-13 years) from the Wellington region of New Zealand were interviewed. RESULTS: Children were knowledgeable about food marketing, although most were not aware of the extent to which they were exposed. Children did not distinguish ‘marketing to children’ from other marketing. According to the children, they were frequently exposed to food marketing, and persuaded, against their better judgement, to purchase food they knew to be harmful to their health. As many children recognised the unhealthy nature of the food marketed to them, they agreed they would take action to reduce junk food marketing if they were Prime Minister for a day. Interventions included making food marketing honest, providing nutrition information, removing billboards and increasing the promotion of healthy food. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest children’s exposure to junk food marketing may cause them physical, mental and moral harm, in direct contradiction of the New Zealand self-regulatory code for marketing. The children’s views align with the World Health Assembly’s recent decision to endorse initiatives to end childhood obesity, including restricting marketing of unhealthy foods. ?

Various factors including retinal disease state and effective electrode placement during surgery, would affect the outcome of retinal prosthesis implementation. In this study, we explore the possible effect of implant foveal eccentricity on retinal activation threshold using computational modelling. Method: Five healthy and five early stage dry age-related macular degeneration human volunteers were scanned using optical coherence tomography. The 3D retinal structure of each individual was extracted from the images and smoothly meshed. A set of five hexapolar electrode configurations was placed in the sub-foveal, 1 mm and 2 mm eccentricity positions from the centre of the retina within the subretinal space. The activation threshold for individual electrodes at all three sites of stimulation were simulated, using bidomain finite element modelling, and compared for all subjects. Results: We found that sub-foveal pit electrode placement required the lowest activation threshold, followed by the 1 mm eccentricity electrode placement. The 2 mm eccentricity electrode placement required the highest activation threshold. Conclusion: Our simulations indicate that clinically minute changes in foveal eccentricity of the subretinal implant can increase activation threshold and therefore, with a given stimulus current, retinal prosthetic performance drops with foveal eccentricity. Translational Relevance: Retinal prosthetic devices have been introduced as a potential therapy for patients suffering from outer retinal diseases. Human subjects with retinal implants demonstrated a varying range of responses to these devices. In this study, we introduce an anatomically-based patient-specific model of the human retina, using it to explore the effect of foveal eccentricity on activation threshold. ? 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",imaging-based computational modeling; modelling of subretinal electrical stimulation; optical coherence tomography,adult; age related macular degeneration; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; electrostimulation; female; finite element analysis; human; male; mathematical computing; mathematical model; optical coherence tomography; retina fovea; simulation; three dimensional imaging,2-s2.0-85065341689

METHOD: The PREDICT-CVD open cohort study is a large, ethnically diverse, New Zealand primary care cohort, generated by using a web-based CVD risk assessment tool. Using encrypted identifiers, participant profiles were linked anonymously to a regional laboratory database (to determine renal function) and to national hospitalisation and mortality datasets. Analyses using a single baseline eGFR measurement were undertaken in three clinical sub-cohorts of participants: those with prior CVD (n=29,742), with diabetes (n=44,416) and with neither CVD nor diabetes (n=192,696). The association between baseline eGFR (by category ?90, 60-89.9, 30-59.9, and &lt;30ml/min/1.73m2) and incident CVD was analysed with Kaplan Meier plots and Cox regression models. RESULTS: After adjustment for traditional CVD risk factors, there was an inverse relationship between CVD risk and eGFR, up to an eGFR of 60ml/min/1.73m2 in all three clinical sub-cohorts, and up to an eGFR of 90ml/min/1.73m2 in the sub-cohort with CVD or diabetes. Compared to eGFR ? 90ml/min/1.73m2, the adjusted hazard ratios of a new CVD event for eGFR ?30ml/min/1.73m2 in the CVD, diabetes and no CVD/ no diabetes sub-cohorts were 2.29 (95% CI 2.00-2.61), 4.71 (3.92-5.67) and 2.78 (2.05-3.77), respectively. Compared to European/Other ethnic groups, Maori participants remained at greater adjusted risk of a new CVD event in all clinical sub-cohorts and Pacific people only in the no CVD/no diabetes sub-cohort, whereas Indian participants had a similar adjusted risk to European/Other, and Other Asian patients were consistently at lower adjusted risk. Sensitivity analyses for individuals with consecutive eGFR results (&gt;90 days apart) yielded similar results. CONCLUSION: This study has confirmed that, in a large ethnically diverse primary care cohort, eGFR is a significant independent predictor of CVD risk, and the risk varies by ethnic group. ?

To allow replication and adaptation of these interventions across settings, it is important to fully understand how they have been developed. However, the development processes of these interventions have not previously been systematically examined. Objective: This study aimed to systematically describe and compare the development process of text messaging interventions identified in the Text2PreventCVD systematic review. Methods: We extracted data about the development process of the 9 interventions identified in the Text2PreventCVD systematic review. Data extraction, which was guided by frameworks for the development of complex interventions, considered the following development stages: intervention planning, design, development, and pretesting. Following data extraction, we invited the developers of the interventions to contribute to our study by reviewing the accuracy of the extracted data and providing additional data not reported in the available publications. Results: A comprehensive description of the development process was available for 5 interventions. Multiple methodologies were used for the development of each intervention. Intervention planning involved gathering information from stakeholder consultations, literature reviews, examination of relevant theory, and preliminary qualitative research. Intervention design involved the use of behavior change theories and behavior change techniques. Intervention development involved (1) generating message content based on clinical guidelines and expert opinions; (2) conducting literature reviews and primary qualitative research to inform decisions about message frequency, timing, and level of tailoring; and (3) gathering end-user feedback concerning message readability, intervention acceptability, and perceived utility. Intervention pretesting involved pilot studies with samples of 10 to 30 participants receiving messages for a period ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. Conclusions: The development process of the text messaging interventions examined was complex and comprehensive, involving multiple studies to guide decisions about the scope, content, and structure of the interventions.

This observational study aimed to determine whether the caregiver's stage of change could predict outcome and adherence to treatment in an intensive intervention programme for children and adolescents with obesity. Setting Participants were from the Wh? nau Pakari randomised clinical trial, a community based multi-disciplinary intervention programme for obesity in Taranaki, New Zealand. Participants Eligible participants (recruited January 2012 to August 2014) were aged 5-16 years and had a body mass index (BMI) ?98th centile or BMI >91st centile with weight-related comorbidities. Interventions This study only assessed participants randomised to the high-intensity intervention programme (6-month assessments with weekly group sessions for 12 months) given attendance data were required (n=96). Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary trial outcome was BMI SD score (SDS). Secondary outcome measures included indices such as fruit and vegetable intake, 550-m run/walk time and quality of life scores. At baseline assessment, participants (if >11 years old) and their accompanying adult were assessed for readiness to make healthy lifestyle change. Results A quantitative measure of stage of change in caregivers was not a predictor of primary or secondary outcomes (change in BMI SDS pre-contemplation/contemplation -0.08, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.03, action -0.16, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.05, p=0.27), or overall attendance in the weekly activity sessions (40.0% vs 37.1%, respectively, p=0.54) in the child or adolescent. Conclusions Caregiver's stage of change was not a predictor of success in this multi-disciplinary assessment and intervention programme for children and adolescents with obesity.

These techniques account for the complexities of, and interrelationships between, behaviours that occur throughout a day (e.g., physical activity, sitting, and sleep). The field of health geography research is also developing rapidly. Novel spatial techniques and data visualisation approaches are increasingly being recognised for their utility in understanding health from a socio-ecological perspective. Linking compositional data approaches with geospatial datasets can yield insights into the role of environments in promoting or hindering the health implications of the daily time-use composition of behaviours. The 7-day behaviour data used in this study were derived from accelerometer data for 882 Auckland school children and linked to weight status and neighbourhood deprivation. We developed novel geospatial visualisation techniques to explore activity composition over a day and generated new insights into links between environments and child health behaviours and outcomes. Visualisation strategies that integrate compositional activities, time of day, weight status, and neighbourhood deprivation information were devised. They include a ringmap overview, small-multiple ringmaps, and individual and aggregated time–activity diagrams. Simultaneous visualisation of geospatial and compositional behaviour data can be useful for triangulating data from diverse disciplines, making sense of complex issues, and for effective knowledge translation. ? 2019 by the authors.

Decision-making theories have evolved to recognise that, although heuristics and biases can lead to error, expert clinician decision makers can also use intuition to good effect. More research is needed to understand how nurses and other clinicians make sense of complexity and uncertainty. Aim: This paper discusses the utility of interpretative phenomenological analysis to elucidate clinical decision making, expertise and intuition. Methods: A narrative review of published interpretative phenomenological analysis studies exploring clinical decision-making, and discussion of an exemplar study. Results: A limited number of interpretative phenomenological analysis studies have been published in this area. By seeking out descriptions of real-world decision making, interpretative phenomenological analysis research provides ecologically valid insights into what it is like to make time-critical, high-stakes decisions with limited information. Conclusion: Contributing to the study of complex clinical decision making in combination with other research approaches, interpretative phenomenological analysis research has significant unrealised potential to inform education, assessment and support interventions and the development of clinical guidelines. Future applications could enhance understanding of multi-disciplinary decision-making and the development of expertise and intuition, over time. ?

This method has been particularly useful in National country-wide surveys to assess the costs of delivering public health programs, which are generally originated in different levels of service management and delivery. Unbiased and efficient estimates of costs are essential to adequately allocate resources and inform policy and planning. In recent years, the global health community has become increasingly interested in estimating the costs of immunization programs. In such programs, part of the cost correspond to vaccines and it is in most countries procured at the central level, while the rest of the costs are incurred in states, municipalities and health facilities, respectively. As such, total program cost is a result of adding these costs, and its variance should account for the relation between the totals at the different levels. An additional challenge is the missing information at the various levels. A variety of methods have been developed to compensate for this missing data. Weighting adjustments are often used to make the estimates consistent with readily-available information. For estimation of total program costs this implies adjusting the estimates at each level to comply with the characteristics of the country. In 2014, A National study to estimate the costs of the Brazilian National Immunization Program was initiated, requested by the Ministry of Health and with the support of international partners. We formulate a quick and useful way to compute the variance and deal with missing values at the various levels. Our approach involves calibrating the weights at each level using additional readily-available information such as the total number of doses administered. Taking the Brazilian immunization costing study as an example, this approach results in substantial gains in both efficiency and precision of the cost estimate. ? 2019 Rivera-Rodriguez et al.

Second, to investigate whether data from child protective services or police improve a predictive risk model derived from health records. Design Retrospective case control study of child protective service and police records. Setting Nine maternity hospitals. Participants 142 consecutive cases of AHT admitted to a tertiary children's hospital from 1991 to 2010 and born in one of the nine participating maternity hospitals. 550 controls matched by the date and hospital of birth. Outcome measure Abusive head trauma. Results There is a relationship between families known to child protective services or police and the risk of AHT. Notification to child protective services: univariable OR 7.24 (95% CI 4.70 to 11.14). Involvement with youth justice: univariable OR 8.94 (95% CI 4.71 to 16.95). Police call-out for partner violence: univariable OR 3.85 (95% CI 2.51 to 5.91). Other violence offence: univariable OR 2.73 (95% CI 1.69 to 4.40). Drug offence: univariable OR 2.82 (95% CI 1.63 to 4.89). However, in multi-variable analysis with data from perinatal health records, notification to child protective services was the only one of these variables to remain in the final model (OR 4.84; 95% CI 2.61 to 8.97) and had little effect on overall predictive power. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 89.5% (95% CI 86.6 to 92.5) using variables from health data alone and 90.9% (95% CI 88.0 to 93.7) when notification was added. Conclusions Family involvement with child protective services or police is associated with increased risk of AHT. However, accessing such data at the time of birth would add little predictive power to a risk model derived from routine health information. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

However, the link between response biomarkers and treatment-targeting biological processes remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a prognosis-guided approach to establish the determinants of treatment response. Methods: The prognoses of biological processes were evaluated by integrating the transcriptomes and clinical outcomes of ~26,000 cases across 39 malignancies. Gene-prognosis scores of 39 malignancies (GEO datasets) were used for examining the prognoses, and TCGA datasets were selected for validation. The Oncomine and GEO datasets were used to establish and validate transcriptional signatures for treatment responses. Findings: The prognostic landscape of biological processes was established across 39 malignancies. Notably, the prognoses of biological processes varied among cancer types, and transcriptional features underlying these prognostic patterns distinguished response to treatment targeting specific biological process. Applying this metric, we found that low tumor proliferation rates predicted favorable prognosis, whereas elevated cellular stress response signatures signified resistance to anti-proliferation treatment. Moreover, while high immune activities were associated with favorable prognosis, enhanced lipid metabolism signatures distinguished immunotherapy resistant patients. Interpretation: These findings between prognosis and treatment response provide further insights into patient stratification for precision treatments, providing opportunities for further experimental and clinical validations.

Methods: A systematic search of literature was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. RCTs published in English between January 2011 and November 2015 were identified using nine electronic databases: MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), EMBASE, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Springer Link, and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they outlined a pharmaceutical care intervention conducted by pharmacists alone or in collaboration with other health care professional(s). The studies were identified and data was extracted independently by two reviewers. The meta-analysis was conducted by using RevMan version 5.3. A random-effects model was used to calculate the standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1 C ) levels. Key findings: Thirteen RCTs outlining PC interventions in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (n?=?1828) were included. The interventions included care plan development, medication reviews, patient education and counselling of patients with follow-up.

Significant heterogeneity in SMD (χ 2 ?=?68.96) was observed. Conclusions: The findings suggest that PC interventions are effective (at least in short-term follow-up in hospital setting) in reducing HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pharmacists, working alone or in collaboration with other health professionals have significant impact on improving the health status of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ? 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society",glycemic control; meta-analysis; pharmaceutical care; randomized controlled trial,hemoglobin A1c; clinical outcome; counseling; exercise; follow up; glycemic control; human; lifestyle modification; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; patient care planning; patient education; pharmaceutical care; priority journal; Review; self monitoring; systematic review; training,2-s2.0-85060193369

However, the presence of resin flow channels in moulded composites results in local geometric variations affecting fibre alignment. In this work, the static tension and flexural performance of composite laminates with resin flow channel(s) have been investigated. Acoustic emission monitoring was used to characterise damage. The frequency of each distinct damage event was monitored to categorise the damage. Under flexural loads, multiple channel specimens demonstrated damage initiation at lower loads and a high accumulation of AE based damage events when channels were facing the compression side of the bending loads.

Triptans, used as an acute treatment for migraine, are available via prescription in Australia. An Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) committee rejected reclassifying sumatriptan and zolmitriptan from prescription medicine to pharmacist-only between 2005 and 2009, largely on the basis of concerns about patient risk. Nevertheless, pharmacist-only triptans may reduce migraine duration and free up healthcare resources. Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of reclassifying triptans from prescription-only to pharmacist-only in Australia. Methods: The study design included decision-analytic modeling combining data from various sources. Behavior before and after reclassification was estimated using medical practitioner and patient surveys and also administrative data. Health outcomes included migraine frequency and duration as well as adverse events (AEs) discussed by the TGA committee. Efficacy and AEs were estimated using randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Results: Reclassifying triptans will reduce migraine duration but increase AEs. This will result in 337 quality-adjusted life-years gained at an increased cost of A$5.9 million over 10 years for all Australian adults older than 15 years (19.6 million). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be A$17 412/quality-adjusted life-year gained. Conclusions: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is likely to be considered cost-effective by Australian decision makers. Serotonin syndrome, a key concern of the TGA committee, had little impact on the results. Further research is needed regarding pharmacist-only triptan use by migraineurs currently using over-the-counter medicines and by nonmigraineurs, the efficacy of triptans, and the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular AEs and chronic headaches with triptans. ? 2019 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",5-HT receptor agonist; behind-the-counter; cost-effectiveness; economics; legislation; nonprescription drugs; over-the-counter; prescription drugs; triptan,non prescription drug; prescription drug; triptan derivative; non prescription drug; oxazolidinone derivative; prescription drug; serotonin 1 agonist; sumatriptan; tryptamine derivative; zolmitriptan; adolescent; adult; age; angina pectoris; Article; Australia; cost effectiveness analysis; death; disease duration; dizziness; drug classification; drug cost; drug induced headache; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; fatigue; gastrointestinal toxicity; heart arrhythmia; human; major clinical study; migraine; patient risk; pharmacist; prescription; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; randomized controlled trial (topic); side effect; thorax pain; transient ischemic attack; classification; cost benefit analysis; drug control; economics; general practitioner; migraine; procedures; trends; Australia; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Drug and Narcotic Control; General Practitioners; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Nonprescription Drugs; Oxazolidinones; Pharmacists; Prescription Drugs; Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists; Sumatriptan; Tryptamines,2-s2.0-85058975819

A nested case–control study of 1,221 melanoma cases and 1,221 controls was performed in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, a prospective cohort of 520,000 participants recruited from 10 European countries. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for incident melanoma in relation to circulating IGF-I concentrations, measured by immunoassay. Analyses were conditioned on the matching factors and further adjusted for age at blood collection, education, height, BMI, smoking status, alcohol intake, marital status, physical activity and in women only, use of menopausal hormone therapy. There was no significant association between circulating IGF-I concentration and melanoma risk (OR for highest vs lowest fifth = 0.93 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71 to 1.22]). There was no significant heterogeneity in the association between IGF-I concentrations and melanoma risk when subdivided by gender, age at blood collection, BMI, height, age at diagnosis, time between blood collection and diagnosis, or by anatomical site or histological subtype of the tumour (Pheterogeneity?0.078).

Upon meeting CS (pseudonym), a 5-year-old boy with Worster Drought Syndrome, I became inadvertently caught in the trap of focusing on his diagnosis rather than CS as a patient. I fumbled around CS's past medical history by fervently asking about all the different types of seizures he was plagued by. It was only after CS's mother, TS (pseudonym), volunteered the psychosocial challenges she faced caring for CS that I realised the strong implicit bias I had towards biomedical aspects of patient care. I discovered that TS was robbed of being able to celebrate CS's developmental milestones, as they posed unique challenges with very serious risks. Having learned the extent of such psychosocial challenges, I searched to understand the origin of biases towards biomedicine, within myself and within the medical system. I attribute my own biases in part to the current state of medical education, which disproportionately focuses on the scientific, rather than psychosocial and humanistic factors. Systemically, there is a large commercial driving force behind scientific research into rare illnesses. The interest in rare illnesses displayed by pharmaceutical industries only after the incentivisation by various countries highlight the socio-political constraints that bind research in this field. These biases, along with the marginalisation of patients and families with rare illnesses, means there is a very real risk that the goals of all stakeholders are incongruous. As such, it is imperative that we give these patients and families a voice. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Implicit bias; Medical student; Psychosocial care; Rare illness,"Article; biomedicine; drug industry; drug repositioning; genetic disorder; health care; health care delivery; human; medical education; medical history; medical research; patient care; politics; psychosocial care; rare disease; risk factor; seizure; statistical bias; Worster Drought Syndrome; medicine; pathology; psychology; rare disease; statistical bias; Bias; Delivery of Health Care; Education, Medical; Humans; Medicine; Psychology; Rare Diseases",2-s2.0-85062373269

The large majority of these receive hemodialysis (HD), while the remaining receive peritoneal dialysis (PD). Peritoneal dialysis may be associated with similar mortality outcomes as HD, and patient-reported outcomes are potentially increased with PD. Existing evidence for the mortality associated with PD was summarized over 20 years ago, and there has been greater marginal improvement in survival with PD relative to HD since that time. It is therefore timely to reexamine the question of differential mortality by modality and summarize evidence from more contemporary practice settings. Methods/design: Electronic databases will be systematically searched for publications that report the association between dialysis modality (HD or PD) with death from any cause and cause-specific death in incident patients with end-stage kidney disease. The database searches will be supplemented by searching through citations and references and consultation with experts. Studies published before 1995 will be excluded. Screening of both titles and abstracts will be done by two independent reviewers. All disagreements will be resolved by an independent third reviewer. A quantitative meta-analysis of effect sizes and standard errors will be applied. Discussion: Our systematic review will update previous evidence summaries and provide a quantitative and standardized assessment of the contemporary literature comparing HD and PD including published and unpublished non-English studies from greater China, Taiwan, and Japan. This review will inform shared decision-making around initial dialysis modality choice and jurisdiction-level considerations of dialysis practice.

We aimed to describe associations between ICVH scores and vascular phenotypes in 11- to 12-year-old children and their parents. Methods and results: Cross-sectional ICVH scores (range 0–7, higher indicating better health), derived by summing dichotomized metrics for cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), diet, physical activity and smoking, were constructed for 1235 adults (89% female, mean age 43 years) and 1028 children (48% female, 12 years). The median scores were 4 and 5 for adults and children respectively. Child ICVH scores were associated with parent scores (0.18 higher child score per additional point in parent's score, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.22, P < 0.001). Each additional point in the adult ICVH score was associated with slower carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV, ?0.32 m/s, 95% CI ?0.37 to ?0.27), greater carotid elasticity (0.017%/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.014 to 0.020) and reduced carotid intima-media thickness (IMT, ?7.3 μm, 95% CI ?12.0 to ?2.5). An additional point in the child score was associated with functional phenotypes (PWV ?0.07 m/s, 95% CI ?0.11 to ?0.03; carotid elasticity 0.009%/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.015) but not structural phenotypes (IMT ?1.8 μm, 95% CI ?5.2 to 1.5). Conclusion: Few Australian children and even fewer parents have ideal cardiovascular health. Lower ICVH scores were associated with adverse adult vascular phenotypes and adverse child vascular function. Family-based interventions optimizing ICVH metrics may delay onset and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and later cardiovascular disease. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cardiovascular risk; Carotid; Child; Hypertension; Intima-media thickness; Obesity,cholesterol; glucose; adult; arterial wall thickness; Article; Australian; blood pressure; body mass; cardiovascular function; carotid artery pulse; child; cholesterol blood level; cross-sectional study; dietary intake; female; femoral artery flow; glucose blood level; groups by age; health status; human; Ideal Cardiovascular Health score; infant; longitudinal study; male; newborn; normal human; parent; peripheral circulation; physical activity; priority journal; scoring system; smoking; Australia; blood; cardiovascular disease; carotid artery; exercise; feeding behavior; femoral artery; health status; middle aged; pathophysiology; phenotype; physiology; procedures; pulse wave; Adult; Australia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Carotid Arteries; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Female; Femoral Artery; Health Status; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Pulse Wave Analysis,2-s2.0-85056694395

Medicine administration is particularly critical for people with Parkinson’s disease where late, or missed doses reduce medicine effectiveness and impact on the quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore the current medicine administration practices of people with Parkinson’s disease in New Zealand. A self-administered online survey was developed by an interprofessional group including people with Parkinson’s disease (the primary stakeholders), speech-language pathologists and pharmacists. The survey was administered using a cross-sectional study design and asked respondents about self-reported swallowing difficulties [using Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10)], medicine regimes and strategies used to swallow medicines. Seventy-one people with Parkinson’s disease responded to the survey (69% male, mean age 72?years, mean years with Parkinson’s disease 9?years). Respondents reported complex daily multi-medicine consumption (mean no. of pills 11, range 2–25). Analyses showed that 57% of respondents scored outside the normal range for EAT-10 (> 3) with 57% complaining of difficulties with pills. Many respondents admitted to missing medicines and requiring external reminders. Multiple strategies for swallowing pills were described including crushing tablets, using yoghurt or fruit juice, and swallowing strategies (such as head tilt, effortful swallow, chin down and altered pill placement in the mouth). Medicine administration is complex and challenging for people with Parkinson’s disease. The development of educational packages for people with Parkinson’s disease, their carers and health professionals is much needed. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Deglutition; Dysphagia; Interprofessional; Medicine administration; Parkinson’s disease,"acetylsalicylic acid; amantadine; amitriptyline; amlodipine; apomorphine; atorvastatin; benserazide; candesartan; carbidopa; cilazapril; citalopram; clonazepam; clopidogrel; docusate sodium; domperidone; donepezil; doxazosin; entacapone; escitalopram; fludrocortisone; levodopa; metoprolol; midodrine; nortriptyline; omeprazole; pramipexole; ropinirole; selegiline; tolcapone; unindexed drug; prescription drug; adult; aged; Article; clinical practice; controlled study; cross-sectional study; decreased appetite; disease duration; drug administration; drug safety; drug use; dysphagia; Eating Assessment Tool 10; female; gastrointestinal disease; health practitioner; health survey; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; medical education; medication error; middle aged; nausea; New Zealand; Parkinson disease; pathologist; pharmacist; priority journal; scoring system; self report; swallowing; taste disorder; vomiting; xerostomia; dysphagia; medication compliance; oral drug administration; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; questionnaire; speech disorder; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Administration, Oral; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Deglutition; Deglutition Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Parkinson Disease; Pharmacists; Prescription Drugs; Self Report; Speech-Language Pathology; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85049693998

Over a million children die each year due to PTB complications, and those who survive can face developmental delays. Unfortunately, our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with PTB remains limited. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting the role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in mediating the effects of PTB on future health outcomes. Thus, epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), where DNAm sites are examined for associations with PTB, can help shed light on the biological mechanisms linking the two. Results: In an Asian cohort of 1019 infants (68 preterm, 951 full term), we examined and compared the associations between PTB and genome-wide DNAm profiles using both cord tissue (n = 1019) and cord blood (n = 332) samples on Infinium HumanMethylation450 arrays. PTB was significantly associated (P < 5.8e-7) with DNAm at 296 CpGs (209 genes) in the cord blood. Over 95% of these CpGs were replicated in other PTB/gestational age EWAS conducted in (cord) blood. This replication was apparent even across populations of different ethnic origin (Asians, Caucasians, and African Americans). More than a third of these 296 CpGs were replicated in at least 4 independent studies, thereby identifying a robust set of PTB-linked epigenetic signatures in cord blood. Interrogation of cord tissue in addition to cord blood provided novel insights into the epigenetic status of the neonates born preterm. Overall, 994 CpGs (608 genes, P < 3.7e-7) associated with PTB in cord tissue, of which only 10 of these CpGs were identified in the analysis using cord blood. Genes from cord tissue showed enrichment of molecular pathways related to fetal growth and development, while those from cord blood showed enrichment of immune response pathways. A substantial number of PTB-associated CpGs from both the birth tissues were also associated with gestational age. Conclusions: Our findings provide insights into the epigenetic landscape of neonates born preterm, and that its status is captured more comprehensively by interrogation of more than one neonatal tissue in tandem. Both these neonatal tissues are clinically relevant in their unique ways and require careful consideration in identification of biomarkers related to PTB and gestational age.

However, access in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Global Action Plan 2013–2020 sets an 80% target for essential NCD medicines’ availability. Poor access is partly due to medicines not being included on the national Essential Medicines Lists (EML) and/or National Reimbursement Lists (NRL) which guide the provision of free/subsidised medicines. We aimed to determine how many countries have essential asthma medicines on their EML and NRL, which essential asthma medicines, and whether surveys might monitor progress. A cross-sectional survey in 2013–2015 of Global Asthma Network principal investigators generated 111/120 (93%) responses—41 high-income countries and territories (HICs); 70 LMICs. Patients in HICs with NRL are best served (91% HICs included ICS (inhaled corticosteroids) and salbutamol). Patients in the 24 (34%) LMICs with no NRL and the 14 (30%) LMICs with an NRL, however no ICS are likely to have very poor access to affordable, quality-assured ICS. Many LMICs do not have essential asthma medicines on their EML or NRL. Technical guidance and advocacy for policy change is required. Improving access to these medicines will improve the health system’s capacity to address NCDs. ? 2019 by the authors.

Aim: To determine whether the acute effects of fructose consumption on serum glucose, insulin, lipids and C-reactive protein differs according to body mass index (BMI) and/or ethnicity. Methods: Participants of M?ori (n = 25), Pacific (n = 26) or New Zealand European (n = 25) ethnicity consumed a 64 g fructose/16 g glucose solution. Changes in lipids, glucose, insulin and C-reactive protein were analysed using mixed models for repeated measures. Results: After adjustment for age and gender, those with higher BMI had a higher glucose (P = 0.0064) and insulin (P = 0.0007) response than those with lower BMI. Those of M?ori or Pacific ethnicity had similar glucose levels (P = 0.077) to those of New Zealand European ethnicity but higher insulin responses (P = 0.0005), which remained after additional adjustment for BMI (P = 0.001). Reported sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) intake was higher among M?ori and Pacific than New Zealand European (median 1.0 vs 0.0 SSB/day P = 0.002). Conclusion: Even after adjustment for BMI, those of M?ori and Pacific ethnicity have a significantly higher insulin response to fructose than New Zealand Europeans.

METHOD: Data on primary TKR procedures performed for OA from 2000 to 2015 in New Zealand was obtained from the New Zealand joint registry. Life tables and population data were sourced from Statistics New Zealand and the Ministry of Health of New Zealand. Lifetime risk of TKR was calculated for each year from 2000 to 2015 using registry population data and life tables. RESULTS: The overall lifetime risk of TKR in New Zealand increased markedly from 2000 to 2015, with females having an overall greater lifetime risk increasing from 9.4% in 2000 to 16.8% in 2015, a relative increase of 78%. However, males showed the greatest increase in risk from 8.1% in 2000 to 16.0% in 2015, a relative increase of 97%. CONCLUSIONS: Current lifetime risk of knee replacement in New Zealand is approximately one in six for males and females. This lifetime risk has increased significantly from 2000 to 2015.

The question addressed was whether the configuration of bilateral internal thoracic arteries (BITAs) influences survival, patency or repeat revascularization in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting. Five hundred and seventy-one papers were found using the reported searches, of which 8 represented the best evidence to answer the clinical question. One systematic review, 4 randomized trials and 3 observational studies were selected. The authors, date, journal, study type, population, main outcome measures and results are tabulated. All 4 prospective randomized trials found no significant difference in graft patency or mortality when comparing Y-graft and in situ configurations. Three of the 4 randomized trials found no difference in major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events or repeat revascularization at follow-up. An exception was Glineur et al. (Bilateral internal thoracic artery configuration for coronary artery bypass surgery: a prospective randomized trial. Circ Cardiovasc Interv 2016;9:7), who found that the Y-configuration resulted in lower rates of major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. All 3 observational studies reviewed found no alteration in survival, cardiac events or repeat revascularization between in situ and Y-graft BITA configurations. One systematic review found similar outcomes with respect to mortality, cardiac events and repeat revascularization with in situ and composite BITA. In summary, existing literature demonstrates no difference in clinical outcomes between composite and in situ graft configurations. Furthermore, the configuration of BITA does not affect mortality, graft patency or repeat revascularization. ? The Author(s) 2018.

Methods: The study population was 14,043 adults with pre-diabetes enrolled in a primary health organization in the upper North Island of New Zealand. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body mass index (BMI) were linked to government health, census and social datasets in the Statistics New Zealand Integrated Data Infrastructure. Adults with a first diagnosis of pre-diabetes between 2009 and 2017 (HbA1c in range 5.9–6.6% [41–49 mmol/mol]) were followed-up for type 2 diabetes incidence. Cox regression was used to examine protective factors and adjust for potential confounding. Results: Cumulative diabetes incidence was 5.0% after three years. Progression was greater in younger adults, men, people with higher HbA1c, greater BMI and a more recent diagnosis. Progression was lower in people treated with metformin, and Indigenous language speakers. Higher progression rates for M?ori (Indigenous population) and Pacific peoples (migrants to New Zealand) were related to higher baseline HbA1c. Conclusions: This is the first study to identify Indigenous language as a protective factor against diabetes, and results confirm obesity as a key target for population prevention.

The applicability of this evidence to Australian non-hospital-based TIA/mS management is uncertain. Aims: Within an Australian community setting we seek to document processes of care, establish determinants of access to care, establish attack rates and determinants of recurrent vascular events and other clinical outcomes, establish the performance of ABC2-risk stratification, and compare the processes of care and outcomes to those in the UK and New Zealand for TIA/mS. Sample size estimates: Recruiting practices containing approximately 51 full-time-equivalent general practitioners to recruit 100 TIA/mS per year over a four-year study period will provide sufficient power for each of our outcomes. Methods and design: An inception cohort study of patients with possible TIA/mS recruited from 16 general practices in the Newcastle-Hunter Valley-Manning Valley region of Australia. Potential TIA/mS will be ascertained by multiple overlapping methods at general practices, after-hours collaborative, and hospital in-patient and outpatient services. Participants’ index and subsequent clinical events will be adjudicated as TIA/mS or mimics by an expert panel. Study outcomes: Process outcomes—whether the patient was referred for secondary care; time from event to first patient presentation to a health professional; time from event to specialist acute-access clinic appointment; time from event to brain and vascular imaging and relevant prescriptions. Clinical outcomes—recurrent stroke and major vascular events; and health-related quality of life.

This study gives a direct measure of this bias, based on a population-based clinical breast cancer registry where the requirement for consent was removed after further ethical review and data could be re-analysed. Methods: In Auckland, New Zealand, the population-based clinical breast cancer registry required written patient consent for inclusion from 2000-2012. A subsequent ethical review removed this requirement and allowed an analysis of consented and non-consented patients. Kaplan-Meier survival to 10 years (mean follow-up 5.1 years, maximum 13.9 years), demographic and clinical characteristics were compared. Of 9244 women with invasive cancer, 926 (10.4%) were not consented, and of 1642 women with ductal carcinoma in situ, 245 (14.9%) were not consented. Results: Survival was much higher for consenting patients; invasive cancer, 5 year survival 83.2% (95% confidence limits 82.2–84.1%) for consenting patients, 57.1% (53.0–60.9%) for non-consenting, and 80.8% in all patients. Analyses based only on consenting patients overestimate survival in all patients by around 2% at 2, 5, and 10 years. Non-consented patients were older, more often of Pacific ethnicity, had fewer screen-detected cancers, and more often had metastatic disease; they less frequently had primary surgery or systemic treatments. Conclusion: Data from a registry requiring active consent gives an upward bias in survival results, as non-consenting patients have more extensive disease, less treatment, and lower survival. To give unbiased results active consent should be not required in a clinical cancer registry. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Breast cancer; Cancer; Informed consent; Opt-in; Opt-out; Registries,"antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; adult; aged; Article; Asian; biological therapy; breast carcinoma; cancer chemotherapy; cancer epidemiology; cancer hormone therapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer registry; cancer surgery; cancer survival; clinical feature; demography; disease specific survival; ethnicity; female; follow up; human; informed consent; intraductal carcinoma; lobular carcinoma in situ; major clinical study; Maori (people); mastectomy; metastasis; middle aged; New Zealand; population research; priority journal; statistical bias; breast tumor; intraductal carcinoma; mortality; pathology; prognosis; register; statistical bias; survival rate; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bias; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Intraductal, Noninfiltrating; Female; Humans; Informed Consent; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Prognosis; Registries; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85059563318

In a large (N = 3,980) diverse cohort, we found that nonresident fathers are more likely to be psychologically distressed than resident fathers (27.4% vs. 15.2%) and more likely to report wanting a change in the level of involvement they have in their child’s life (76.6% vs. 58.1%). Nonresident fathers were more likely to suffer economic hardship, unemployment, poor health, and have a depression and anxiety history (ps <.001). However, the factors associated with increased psychological distress were largely the same across resident and nonresident fathers. The biggest stressors were managing work alongside family responsibilities and commitments, arguments with the partner, prior history of depression, and economic hardship or deprivation. Fathers’ actual levels of involvement and desired levels of involvement with their child did not predict their psychological distress. ?

We quantified the agreement rates in the STABILITY trial on 15,828 patients with stable coronary heart disease. Methods: Investigators were instructed to report all potential events. Each reported event was reviewed independently by 2 reviewers according to prespecified processes and prespecified end point definitions. Concordance between reported and adjudicated cardiovascular (CV) events was evaluated, as well as event classification influence on final study results. Results: In total, CEC reviewed 7,096 events: 1,064 deaths (696 CV deaths), 958 myocardial infarctions (MI), 433 strokes, 182 transient ischemic attacks, 2,052 coronary revascularizations, 1,407 hospitalizations for unstable angina, and 967 hospitalizations for heart failure. In total, 71.8% events were confirmed by CEC. Concordance was high (>80%) for cause of death and nonfatal MI and lower for hospitalization for unstable angina (25%) and heart failure (50%). For the primary outcome (composite of CV death, MI, and stroke), investigators reported 2,086 events with 82.5% confirmed by CEC. The STABILITY trial treatment effect of darapladib versus placebo on the primary outcome was consistent using investigator-reported events (hazard ratio 0.96 [95% CI 0.87– 1.06]) or adjudicated events (hazard ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.85– 1.03]). Conclusions: The primary outcome results of the STABILITY trial were consistent whether using investigator-reported or CEC-adjudicated events. The proportion of investigator-reported events confirmed by CEC varied by type of event. These results should help improve event identification in clinical trials to optimize ascertainment and adjudication. ? 2018 The Authors",,"darapladib; benzaldehyde derivative; darapladib; oxime; phospholipase A2 inhibitor; placebo; adult; Article; cause of death; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; heart failure; heart infarction; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle revascularization; hospitalization; human; ischemic heart disease; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; priority journal; transient ischemic attack; unstable angina pectoris; bioassay; cerebrovascular accident; complication; coronary artery disease; heart failure; heart infarction; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; percutaneous coronary intervention; randomized controlled trial; transient ischemic attack; unstable angina pectoris; Angina, Unstable; Benzaldehydes; Coronary Disease; Endpoint Determination; Heart Failure; Hospitalization; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Myocardial Infarction; Oximes; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Phospholipase A2 Inhibitors; Placebos; Stroke",2-s2.0-85058984907

Methods: A total of 5,336 nulliparous women from the SCreening fOr Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study were included. Women’s birth weights were self-reported and confirmed via medical records when possible. A birth weight of 3,000 to 3,499 g was considered the reference. Results: After adjusting for confounders, birth weight?<?2,500 g was associated with increased risk of GH (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]?=?2.2, 95% CI?=?1.3-3.7), PE (aOR?=?1.7, 95% CI?=?1.0-2.9), small for gestational age (aOR?=?1.9, 95% CI?=?1.1-3.2), and GDM (aOR?=?2.4, 95% CI?=?1.0-5.8) compared with the referent.

While weight-based regimens increase concentrations of IGF-1 and decrease concentrations of myostatin, it is not known whether the reduced effectiveness of individually titrated GH regimens is due to ongoing hypersecretion of myostatin. Consequently, the aims of this study were to determine whether concentrations of myostatin in blood and skeletal muscle are increased in GH-deficient adults, and whether these concentrations are decreased by GH replacement regimens titrated to restore serum IGF-1. Design: Twenty-six GH deficient adults (18 men and 8 women) were treated with individualised regimens of recombinant human GH aiming to achieve serum concentrations of IGF-1 within one standard deviation of the age- and gender-adjusted mean. Plasma concentrations of myostatin were measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment were compared to fifteen healthy controls (9 men and 6 women). Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed in 19 of these GH-deficient adults (15 men and 4 women) and 10 of the healthy controls (6 men and 4 women). Expression of IGF-1 and myostatin mRNA was determined by qPCR. Results: Concentrations of IGF-1 in serum and mRNA in skeletal muscle were reduced, and concentrations of myostatin in plasma and mRNA in skeletal muscle were increased in GH-deficient adults at baseline (P <.05 versus healthy controls). Despite restoring concentrations of IGF-1, GH replacement did not reduce concentrations of myostatin in either blood or skeletal muscle. Concentrations of IGF-1 and myostatin in both blood and skeletal muscle were positively correlated in GH-deficient adults at baseline (P <.05), but not in GH-replete adults. Conclusions: Concentrations of myostatin in blood and skeletal muscle are increased in GH-deficient adults. Despite normalising concentrations of IGF-1, individualised regimens of GH replacement do not reduce concentrations of myostatin in blood or skeletal muscle. Ongoing hypersecretion of myostatin may explain why individually titrated GH replacement regimens are less effective than higher weight-based regimens in increasing skeletal muscle mass. ? 2018",GH deficiency; GH replacement; IGF1; Myostatin; Skeletal muscle,"ethinylestradiol plus levonorgestrel; hydrocortisone; levothyroxine; myostatin; recombinant growth hormone; somatomedin C; testosterone; human growth hormone; IGF1 protein, human; myostatin; somatomedin C; adrenal insufficiency; adult; age distribution; Article; clinical article; controlled study; female; growth hormone deficiency; hormone substitution; human; human tissue; hypogonadism; hypothyroidism; male; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; sex difference; skeletal muscle; tissue level; blood; case control study; growth disorder; metabolism; middle aged; skeletal muscle; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Growth Disorders; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Myostatin",2-s2.0-85058043114

Current research suggests social capital, that is, the positive benefits gained from a relationship with others in the community, plays a key role in addressing health risk behaviours. The current literature on social capital and health is fragmented, and the field has yet to produce an up-to-date synthesis of past findings to help researchers understand the current status of this research area. This article fills this gap with an integrative review of empirical research based on rigorous criteria. Boolean search was used to limit the search to only those articles containing the keywords ‘social capital’ and ‘health risk’ but no limits were applied for country or population of interest or publication start date. Two researchers screened through the title, abstract and introduction of every retrieved article independently according to the inclusion criteria. A total of 105 articles were eligible for further analyses. This article contributes by: (1) providing a structured overview with an aim to disentangle the findings of varied past studies addressing the theme; (2) identifying important gaps in current knowledge; (3) presenting a research agenda that flows logically from the theoretical gaps identified; and lastly (4) proposing a theoretical framework upon which social capital interventions can be designed and executed to mitigate health risk.

Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled 257 community-dwelling older adults (median age 79 years). Assessments included the Mini Nutritional Assessment-Short Form (MNA?-SF) for nutrition risk; the Eating Assessment Tool-10 for dysphagia risk; bioimpedance analysis for body composition (free fat mass (FFM) and percentage body fat) and gait speed for physical performance. A multiple logistics regression analysis was conducted, to determine factors associated with lower odds [OR (95% CI)] for nutrition risk. Results: Every yearly increase in age was associated with higher odds 1.09 (1.01–1.17) for nutrition risk. Additionally, nutrition risk was less likely to occur among participants of age <85 years 0.30 (0.11–0.79), with no dysphagia 0.29 (0.09–0.97) and those with a healthy gait speed 0.29 (0.09–0.97). Lower odds for nutrition risk were also found with increasing values of FFM index 0.51 (0.34–0.77), and percentage body fat 0.81 (0.72–0.90). Gait speed was positively correlated with FFM index (r=0.19 p<0.022), percentage body fat (r=0.23, p=0.006) and BMI (r=0.29, p<0.001). Conclusion: Among these participants, associations between nutrition risk, body composition and physical performance were found. Implications for public health: Routine screening of nutrition risk and/or physical performance among vulnerable older adults is key towards identifying those in need of assessment and dietary intervention. Alongside strategies to encourage physical activity, this may help to slow losses of FFM and protect physical performance. ? 2018 The Authors",BMI; body composition; nutrition risk; physical performance,"aged; body composition; cross-sectional study; female; fitness; geriatric assessment; human; independent living; male; middle aged; nutritional status; procedures; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Composition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Independent Living; Male; Middle Aged; Nutritional Status; Physical Fitness; Physical Functional Performance; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85056785832

Though there are numerous reports of As neurotoxicity, its pathogenesis mechanisms remain vague especially its chronic effects on metabolic network. Hippocampus is a renowned area in relation to learning and memory, whilst recently, cerebellum is argued to be involved with process of cognition. Therefore, the study aimed to explore metabolomics alternations in these two areas after chronic As exposure, with the purpose of further illustrating details of As neurotoxicity. Twelve 3-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were divided into two groups, receiving deionized drinking water (control group) or 50 mg/L of sodium arsenite (via drinking water) for 24 weeks. Learning and memory abilities were tested by Morris water maze (MWM) test. Pathological and morphological changes of hippocampus and cerebellum were captured via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Metabolic alterations were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). MWM test confirmed impairments of learning and memory abilities of mice after chronic As exposure. Metabolomics identifications indicated that tyrosine increased and aspartic acid (Asp) decreased simultaneously in both hippocampus and cerebellum. Intermediates (succinic acid) and indirect involved components of tricarboxylic acid cycle (proline, cysteine, and alanine) were found declined in cerebellum, indicating disordered energy metabolism. Our findings suggest that these metabolite alterations are related to As-induced disorders of amino acids and energy metabolism, which might therefore, play an important part in mechanisms of As neurotoxicity. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",arsenic; cerebellum; hippocampus; metabolomics; neurotoxicity,"Amino acids; Arsenic; Brain; Deionized water; Health risks; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Mammals; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Potable water; Transmission electron microscopy; cerebellum; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometries (GC-MS); Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; hippocampus; Metabolomics; Morphological changes; Neurotoxicity; Tricarboxylic acid cycle; Gas chromatography; alanine; arsenite sodium; aspartic acid; cysteine; proline; succinic acid; tyrosine; arsenic; arsenic; aspartic acid; brain; drinking water; ecotoxicology; gas chromatography; genomics; learning; mass spectrometry; memory; metabolism; neurology; physiological response; rodent; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain level; cerebellum; controlled study; energy metabolism; hippocampus; learning disorder; long term exposure; male; mass fragmentography; memory disorder; metabolic disorder; metabolite; metabolomics; Morris water maze test; mouse; neuropathology; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; transmission electron microscopy; animal; C57BL mouse; cerebellum; drug effect; hippocampus; mass fragmentography; maze test; memory; metabolism; metabolomics; pathology; procedures; rat; toxicity; toxicity and intoxication; ultrastructure; water pollutant; Mus; Animals; Arsenic; Cerebellum; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Hippocampus; Male; Maze Learning; Memory; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolomics; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neurotoxicity Syndromes; Rats; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2-s2.0-85055678135

Cochrane's Effectiveness and Efficiency frequently appears as a key reference in debates over, and a justification for, contemporary evidence-based medicine. Cochrane's concern in this text with the equality of care as the ultimate rationale for why effectiveness and efficiency of cure are needed has, however, largely disappeared from debate. In this article, we reconsider Cochrane's approach through the use of case studies of plural forms of medicine in the Czech Republic, namely traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy and spa care. In addition to bringing equality back into the picture, we also identify four expansions to Cochrane's original vision arising from the difficulties of separating cure from care; the overlap between prevention and cure; the complex actions of some multi-faceted therapies; and recent reconceptualisations of the placebo effect. In conclusion, we suggest that instead of the widely used strictly vertical “evidence pyramid”, a descriptor of the horizontal and additive ordering of evidence might be more appropriate. We also argue that in healthcare systems characterised by a multiplicity of approaches, if we want to truly benefit from this heterogeneity, we must take seriously each medical tradition's approaches to prevention, cure, care, as well as efficiency, efficacy and equality. ? 2018 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness",Central and Eastern Europe; complementary and alternative medicine; equity; ethnography; evidence-based medicine; fairness; health policy,"alternative medicine; article; Chinese medicine; Czech Republic; ethnography; health care policy; homeopathy; human; placebo effect; systematic review; vision; Chinese medicine; cultural anthropology; Czech Republic; evidence based medicine; homeopathy; Anthropology, Cultural; Czech Republic; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Policy; Homeopathy; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional",2-s2.0-85052465354

The health-related experiences of children and young people who migrate, however, are relatively absent, with children’s migration and health status often conflated with that of their parents. The omission of children’s own perspectives limits knowledge about how health is understood and experienced by child migrants, including the identification of best ways to support their health. Drawing on the empirical literature on child migrants and health from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Western Pacific Region, we adopt a critical perspective to examine how the research to date supports a particular way of understanding and investigating the health of children and young people who migrate. Specifically, we highlight how a dominant focus on parents’ migration status, (negative) health outcomes and patterns of risk behaviours limits, rather than aids, the understanding of migrant children’s health. In doing so, we illustrate how much of the evidence base upholds Westernised biomedical notions of health and privileges the use of particular methodologies to assess health outcomes and reduce health risks. These preferences, in turn, shape the subsequent range of ‘appropriate’ forms of health education for, rather than with, children. We conclude by drawing on some exceptions and consider the opportunities these provide for developing health education in line with children’s own understandings of health – crucially underscoring the importance migrant children and young people attach to the more social aspects of their health and migration experiences. ?

This paper describes a theoretically underpinned and systematic approach to exploring potential interventions to reduce harm. Methods: Individual, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with purposively sampled pharmacists (n = 8), doctors (n = 4), nurses (n = 6) and patients (n = 17) from Auckland, New Zealand. Thematic analysis of suggested interventions was undertaken, and these were linked to relevant intervention functions of the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). Analysis of previously defined factors influencing sharing were mapped onto the “Capability, Opportunity, Motivation – Behaviour” (COM-B) model of the BCW. Results: COM-B analysis of the factors influencing sharing behaviour revealed: (i) ‘Capability’-related factors, such as patient misconceptions about the safety of certain medicines, forgetting to refill or to carry around own medicines, and lack of knowledge about safe disposal of leftover/unused medicines; (ii) ‘Opportunity’-related factors included lack of access to health facilities, lack of time to see a doctor, linguistic and cultural barriers, lack of information from healthcare providers about risks of sharing, and having leftover/unused medicines, and (iii) ‘Motivation’-related factors included altruism, illness denial, embarrassment about seeing a doctor, not carrying around own medicines, habit, and fear of negative health consequences from missing a few doses of medicines. Five intervention functions of the BCW appear to be the most likely candidates for targeting the factors which relate to medicine sharing. These are education, persuasion, enablement, environmental restructuring and restriction. Conclusions: A variety of personal and external factors which influence sharing behaviours were identified, and the BCW provided a means by which theoretically underpinned interventions to reduce potential harms from this behaviour could be proposed. The findings can help with the design of approaches to reduce harm associated with non-recreational medicine sharing. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.Article synopsis: Medicine sharing can result in negative health outcomes; thus, systematically developed interventions to reduce potential harms from medicine-sharing are required. This qualitative study used the ‘Behaviour Change Wheel’ (BCW) to apply a theory-based approach to identifying (a) factors influencing patients' non-recreational prescription medicine sharing behaviours and (b) potential interventions. The findings indicate that factors related to ‘Capability’ (knowledge and cognitive skills), ‘Opportunity’ (environmental factors), and ‘Motivation’ (‘brain processes that energize and direct behaviour’) influence medicine sharing behaviours. Education, persuasion, enablement, environmental restructuring, and restriction appear to be the most suitable BCW intervention functions to target factors influencing medicine sharing. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Behaviour change wheel; COM-B; Intervention; Medicine borrowing; Medicine lending; Medicine sharing,adult; altruism; article; behavior change; brain; clinical article; education; environmental factor; fear; female; health care facility; human; interview; male; medicine; motivation; New Zealand; nurse; persuasive communication; pharmacist; prescription; qualitative research; skill; thematic analysis; theoretical study; aged; attitude to health; health behavior; health care personnel; middle aged; motivation; patient; psychology; young adult; prescription drug; Adult; Aged; Attitude to Health; Female; Health Behavior; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; New Zealand; Patients; Prescription Drugs; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85046139105

Hyperthyroidism may also be associated with other heart diseases including cardiac ischaemia and cardiac failure. Currently, the prevalence of thyrotoxicosis in cardiac admissions in the absence of a rhythm disorder is unknown. Aims: The aims of this study were: 1) to calculate the prevalence of admissions for thyrotoxicosis-associated cardiac disease, 2) determine the type of cardiac disease i.e. dysrhythmic, ischaemic or cardiac failure, and 3) to assess whether M?ori are over-represented amongst patients admitted to hospital with cardiac complications of thyrotoxicosis. Methods: A retrospective review of admissions with both thyrotoxicosis and cardiac disease from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2012 inclusive. Results: Seventy-two patients were identified as being admitted for a cardiac complication of thyrotoxicosis, giving a mean of nine admissions per year. Dysrhythmia was the cause for admission in 32 patients, ischaemia in 12, cardiac failure in 11 and mixed cardiac disease in 17. Graves’ disease and amiodarone-induced were the most common causes of the thyrotoxicosis (25 and 19 cases, respectively). Of the cohort 26 (36.1%) were M?ori (compared to 16.8% of all cardiac admissions over the same period). M?ori were more likely to present with cardiac failure than non-M?ori (57.7% vs. 26.1%, p = 0.008 respectively). Conclusions: M?ori are over-represented amongst patients admitted with cardiac complications of thyrotoxicosis and more often present with cardiac failure than non-M?ori. Measurement of thyroid function should be considered in patients presenting not only with atrial fibrillation but also in patients presenting with cardiac failure, particularly if they are M?ori. ? 2017 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)",Atrial fibrillation; Congestive heart failure; Graves’ disease; Hyperthyroidism; Toxic multinodular goitre,"amiodarone; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease burden; disease severity; female; Graves disease; heart failure; heart muscle ischemia; hospital admission; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; thyroid function; thyrotoxicosis; complication; follow up; heart disease; hospital admission; incidence; middle aged; New Zealand; risk assessment; risk factor; thyrotoxicosis; trends; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Diseases; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Patient Admission; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Thyrotoxicosis; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85042557113

These conditions are by their nature ones that unfold over a long period of time, typically involving many healthcare events, treatments and changes of patient status. The gold standard in public health informatics for risk assessment is regression-based. While these techniques are effective in identifying factors contributing to risk, they produce reductive scores (e.g. probability of a specific class of event, like a heart attack) or binary prediction results, and moreover, they are sequence agnostic. In the area of long-term chronic disease management, multivariate sequential modeling offers an opportunity to forecast disease progression and treatment trajectory in a fine-grained manner in order to aid clinical decision making. This paper investigates the suitability of Long short-term memory, a type of recurrent neural network, in conducting multivariate sequential modeling in the healthcare domain, specifically in the task of forecasting.

Yet, the underlying mechanisms and efficacy on brain function are not well understood. Therefore, this study investigated the previously proposed hypothesis that acupuncture suppresses motor cortex excitability using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy adults. The study was randomised, sham-controlled, and double-blinded. Single and paired-pulse TMS was delivered before, during, immediately after, and 30 min after removal of the needle. Acupuncture to the right Hegu acupoint (LI-4) of the hand was delivered by an experienced acupuncturist using standardised manipulations. A disposable (0.22×30 mm, Hwato) needle was used for verum stimulation (penetrating) and a Park retractable needle for sham (nonpenetrating). The peak-to-peak amplitude of TMS-induced motor-evoked potentials was recorded from two intrinsic hand muscles. Needling sensations were quantified using the Massachusett's acupuncture sensation scale. Participant needling sensations were not different between verum or sham acupuncture (P>0.54). Corticomotor excitability, intracortical inhibition, and intracortical facilitation were not modulated by verum or sham acupuncture during, immediately after, or 30 min after, recorded from a local or distant hand muscle to the needling site (all P>0.075). Contrary to previous studies, manual acupuncture did not affect motor cortex excitability in healthy adults. Because of the increasing popularity of acupuncture therapy, further research using patient populations should be considered. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Implanting self-expanding metal stents in the esophagus is one of the most effective ways for the palliation of the malignant dysphagia. The stents are associated with a common problem known as stent migration (SM) in the esophagus which occurs due to the axial force applied by the peristaltic contractions. A softbodied esophageal swallowing robot (ESR) has been developed to mimic the human swallowing process. Peristalsis in the ESR was achieved by modelling the biological peristaltic wave contractions. This paper discuss a new methodology to test and analyse a newly designed flared stent and its migration on the esophageal swallowing robot. Stent migration tests were performed on the esophageal swallowing robot to determine the displacement of the stent from its initial position due to the effect of the travelling of the peristaltic contractile waves. It was observed that migration displacement increases with the number of peristalsis cycle until it reaches a saturation point where no further displacement occurs. It was also noted that by increasing the applied input pressure in the esophageal swallowing robot, the stent migration displacement becomes higher. The work discussed here also promises that a tool like esophageal swallowing robot can provide a passage for a better stent design which can illuminate the path of prevention of stent migration. ? 2018 IEEE.",dysphagia; esophageal cancer; esophageal swallowing robot; peristalsis; stent migration,Diseases; Machine design; Physiology; Robots; Stents; dysphagia; Esophageal cancer; Migration tests; peristalsis; Peristaltic waves; Saturation point; Stent design; stent migration; Computer vision,2-s2.0-85061825768

New Zealand is a developed economy that reports poor childhood nutrition-related health statistics, particularly among minority children, yet has no measure of FS applicable to infancy. The objective was to develop an FS index for New Zealand infants and examine its association with demographic covariates and health outcomes. Within a large (n = 6853) nationally representative cohort, variables describing infant food consumption, breastfeeding, and maternal food-related coping methods were collected from mothers during late infancy. An FS index was derived using confirmatory factor analysis. Associations were assessed by logistic regressions and described using odds ratios (OR) and ?95% confidence intervals (CI). Fifteen percent of the cohort was highly FS, 43% tenuously food insecure (FIS), and 16% highly food insecure (FIS). Infants from minority ethnic groups had lower odds of being food secure, as did those born to the youngest mothers, mothers who smoked, or those who lived in low-income households. FIS infants had higher odds of morbidity. Interventions to improve infant FS should focus on improving dietary quality, and should give particular consideration to minority infants. We identified that FIS shows wide ethnic and socioeconomic inequity, and is associated with poorer health. The most important driving factors of FIS included poor quality weaning diets, as well as poverty and its proxies. Any interventions to improve infant FS should focus on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption to recommended intake levels, and should give particular consideration to minority infants. ? 2019 by the authors.

However, these associations remain inconclusive. This study aimed to systematically review the association between street connectivity and childhood obesity. A literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science for articles published before January 1, 2019. All original studies that investigated the association between street connectivity and weight-related behaviours or outcomes among children and adolescents were included. Forty-seven articles were identified, including eight longitudinal and 41 cross-sectional studies conducted in eight countries. The sample size ranged from 88 to 46 813. Street intersection density (SID), measured by Geographic Information Systems in 36 studies and reported in 13 studies, was the main indicator used to represent street connectivity. Forty-four studies examined the association between SID and weight-related behaviours, including overall PA (n = 15), moderate-to-vigorous PA (n = 13), active transport (n = 12), dog walking (n = 1), walking (n = 1), sedentary behaviours (n = 2), and TV viewing (n = 1). Fifteen studies focused on the association between SID and weight-related outcomes. Overall, evidence from this systematic review and meta-analyses suggested a positive association between street connectivity and PA. However, it was difficult to draw a conclusion on the association between street connectivity and BMI. More longitudinal evidence is needed to confirm the causal association between street connectivity and weight status. ? 2019 The Authors.

To understand these trends, it is important to consider the context in which students make decisions about which university courses to enrol in. The current study seeks to investigate gender differences in STEM through a unique approach that combines network analysis of student enrollment data with an interpretive lens based on the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu. We generate a network of courses taken by around 9000 undergraduate physics students (from 2009 to 2014) to quantify Bourdieu's concept of field. We identify the fields in which physics students participate by constructing a weighted co-enrollment network and finding communities within it. We then use odds ratios to report gender differences in transverse movements between different academic fields, and non-parametric tests to assess gender differences in vertical movements (changes in students' achievement rankings within a field). Odds ratios comparing the likelihood of progression from one field to another indicate that female students were more likely to make transverse movements into life science fields. We also found that university physics did a poor job in attracting high achieving students, and especially high achieving female students. Of the students who did choose to study physics at university, low and middle achieving female high school students were more likely to decrease their relative rank in their first year compared to their male counterparts. Low achieving female students were also less likely to continue with physics after their first year compared to their male counterparts. Results and implications are discussed in the context of Bourdieu's theory, and previous research. We argue that in order to remove constraints on female students' study choices, the field of physics needs to provide a culture in which all students feel like they belong. ? 2019 Turnbull et al.

To assess pharmacy students’ opinions of an interprofessional learning (IPL) course in their final year of the Bachelor of Pharmacy program at The University of Auckland. Methods. Pharmacy students participated in the second day of a two-day simulation-based course, WardSim, alongside medical and nursing students in an acute care, hospital ward setting. After finishing the course, all students were asked to complete a questionnaire. The responses of pharmacy, nursing, and medical students on the scaled questions were compared. An in-depth thematic analysis of the pharmacy students’ responses to the open-ended questions was completed using an iterative process. Results. Significant differences were found among the students’ responses regarding the prioritization of care, systematic assessment of patients, and communication strategies. Pharmacy students had less favourable responses regarding the IPL experience than medical and nursing students. However, overall responses were positive. Some of the themes that emerged among the pharmacy students’ responses included: learning communication tools, being assertive in communicating with other health care professionals, and understanding their own and others’ roles in the health care team. Furthermore, some pharmacy students reported feeling underprepared for and underutilized during patient care scenarios. Conclusion. An IPL experience in an acute patient care setting demonstrated clear and beneficial learning outcomes for pharmacy students, especially in regards to communicating and understanding their roles and those of others on their team. Tailoring the pre-work or scenarios for the IPL experience to be more pharmacy orientated and having pharmacy students participate on both days may improve the preparedness for IPL. ? 2019, American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy.

In this study we investigated the expression of induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) markers and their localization in primary low-grade adenocarcinoma (LGCA) and high-grade adenocarcinoma (HGCA) and their patientmatched normal colon samples. Materials and methods Transcription and translation of iPSC markers OCT4, SOX2, NANOG, KLF4 and c-MYC were investigated using immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, RT-qPCR and in-situ hybridization (ISH). Results All five iPSC markers were detected at the transcriptional and translational levels. Protein abundance was found to be correlated with tumor grade. Based on their protein expression within the tumors, two sub-populations of cells were identified: A NANOG+/OCT4-epithelial subpopulation and an OCT4+/NANOG-stromal subpopulation. All cases were accurately graded based on four pieces of iPSC marker-related data. Conclusions This study suggests the presence of two putative sub-populations of CSCs: A NANOG+/OCT4-epithelial subpopulation and an OCT4+/NANOG-stromal subpopulation. Normal colon, LGCA and HGCA could be accurately distinguished from one another using iPSC marker expression. Once validated, novel combinations of iPSC markers may provide diagnostic and prognostic value to help guide patient management. ? 2019 Munro et al.

Sharing expertise benefits other practitioners, the profession, and healthcare overall. When professionals are unwilling to share, it is a missed opportunity to achieve the best outcomes for patients. METHODS: A narrative review of the literature in relation to professional confidence and expertise across allied health disciplines revealed a number of potential threats to professional confidence and consequently willingness to share information in an ‘expert’ role. FINDINGS: There is limited literature addressing development of professional confidence post-qualification, particularly after the first year of practice. Role ambiguity, unclear scope of practice, low professional status, and role conflict all threaten the confidence of practitioners. The importance of reflection as a practice to develop and maintain confidence is highlighted in both the student and practitioner literature. CONCLUSION: Training organisations and health workforce employers should consider how professional confidence can be developed and maintained across the career span, with subsequent benefits for development of expertise and knowledge sharing.

Measurement of people’s interactions with food stores is important to advance understanding of the associations between the food environment and in-store behaviour. This paper describes a new method, Food Store Environment Examination (FoodSee) to measure people’s interaction with the food store environment in a feasibility study focused on convenience stores and children. Methods: One hundred and sixty-eight randomly selected children (aged 11–13 years) recruited from 16 randomly selected schools in Wellington, New Zealand, used wearable cameras for 4 days that recorded images every 7 s. The study was conducted from July 2014 to June 2015. All images of convenience stores and service stations, and a sample of images from supermarkets, were evaluated to determine the feasibility of assessing food availability and marketing. The outcomes of interest assessed were: food product availability, placement, packaging, branding, price promotion, purchases and consumption. Results: Thirty-seven children (22%) visited a convenience store or service station at least once during the study period. In total, there were 65 visits to 34 different stores. Seven hundred and nineteen images revealed the in-store environment. Of those, 86.1% were usable and able to be analysed for the outcomes of interest. Conclusions: The FoodSee methodology provides a promising new method to study people’s interaction with the in-store food environment. The evidence generated will be valuable in understanding and improving the food store environment within which people shop, and will contribute to efforts to address obesity globally. ?

The cis-isomers of lycopene occurring in tangerine tomatoes were, through clinical trials, proven to be more bioavailable than the all-trans lycopene found in red tomatoes. Nonetheless, scientific evidence regarding the bioactivities of the tangerine tomatoes is lacking. In this article, the antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties of extracts prepared from four different tomato varieties, namely Alfred, Olga’s Round Golden Chicken Egg, Golden Green, and Golden Eye, were investigated. While the antioxidant capacities of the extracts were measured through the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays, their anti-proliferative properties in prostate cancer cell lines were examined through the Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay. The anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts were assessed through the toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein 2 (NOD2)-mediated inflammatory pathways. Our results show that the tangerine tomatoes had lower IC50 values in both the anticancer and anti-inflammatory assays compared to the red tomatoes. Specifically, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of the tangerine tomatoes in LNCaP cells were approximately two to three fold lower than the red tomato (IC50: 14.46, 5.62, and 8.08 mg dry tomato equivalent/mL from Alfred hexane-acetone, Olga’s Round Golden Chicken Egg hexane, and Golden Green hexane, respectively). These findings indicate that the tangerine varieties, Olga’s Round Golden Chicken Egg and Golden Green, possess greater potential to be used in conjunction with treatment and for the prevention of cancer and inflammatory-related diseases than the Alfred (red) and Golden Eye (high beta-carotene) varieties. ? 2019 by the authors.

Methods: This agent-based model retrospectively simulated SDCD during Romp & Chomp, a 4-year whole-of-community childhood obesity prevention intervention in Victoria, Australia. Stakeholder survey data, intervention records, and expert estimates were used to parameterize the model. Model output was evaluated against criteria derived from empirical data and experts’ estimates of the magnitude and timing of community knowledge and engagement change. Results: The model was able to produce outputs that met the evaluation criteria: increases in simulated community knowledge and engagement driven by SDCD closely matched expert estimates of magnitude and timing. Conclusions: Strong suggestive evidence was found in support of a hypothesis that SDCD was a key driver of the success of the Romp & Chomp intervention.

Fourteen trials met inclusion criteria (median n?=?554; mean intervention duration?=?10.8?mo; follow-up?=?4.4?mo). “Effective” approaches included environmental changes such as school water fountain installations and cafeteria menu changes and possibly less sustainable strategies such as health education lessons. However, effect sizes even of these selected significant treatment benefits were modest—significant body mass index z-score effects range from ?0.1 to ?0.2. Each trial was associated with very small improvements in body composition.

Between 2012 and 2015, active surveillance of acute respiratory infection (ARI) hospitalisations during winter seasons was used to estimate the seasonal incidence of laboratory-confirmed RSV hospitalisations in children aged <5 years in Auckland, New Zealand (NZ). Incidence rates were estimated by fine age group, ethnicity and socio-economic status (SES) strata. Additionally, RSV disease estimates determined through active surveillance were compared to rates estimated from hospital discharge codes. There were 5309 ARI hospitalisations among children during the study period, of which 3923 (73.9%) were tested for RSV and 1597 (40.7%) were RSV-positive. The seasonal incidence of RSV-associated ARI hospitalisations, once corrected for non-testing, was 6.1 (95% confidence intervals 5.8–6.4) per 1000 children <5 years old. The highest incidence was among children aged <3 months. Being of indigenous M?ori or Pacific ethnicity or living in a neighbourhood with low SES independently increased the risk of an RSV-associated hospitalisation. RSV hospital discharge codes had a sensitivity of 71% for identifying laboratory-confirmed RSV cases. RSV infection is a leading cause of hospitalisation among children in NZ, with significant disparities by ethnicity and SES. Our findings highlight the need for effective RSV vaccines and therapies. ?

This phenomenon is most prominent for diseases characterized by high cumulative incidence and high heritability, examples of which include Alzheimer’s disease, coronary artery disease, cerebral stroke, and type 2 diabetes, while for late-onset diseases with relatively lower prevalence and heritability, exemplified by cancers, the effect is significantly lower. In this research, computer simulations have demonstrated that genome-wide association studies of late-onset polygenic diseases showing high cumulative incidence together with high initial heritability will benefit from using the youngest possible age-matched cohorts. Moreover, rather than using age-matched cohorts, study cohorts combining the youngest possible cases with the oldest possible controls may significantly improve the discovery power of genome-wide association studies. ? 2019 by the authors.

This study investigates whether an intracellular PEG-detachment strategy can overcome this PEG dilemma. Materials & methods: First, PEG2000 was conjugated with a phospholipid via an acid-labile hydrazide-hydrazone bond (-CO-NH-N = CH-), which was postinserted into pSL, forming PEG-cleavable pSL (CL-PEG-pSL). Their endo/lysosomal-escape abilities in MIA PaCa-2 cells, pharmacokinetics and tumor accumulation abilities were studied using PEG-pSL as reference. Results: CL-PEG-pSL showed rapid endo/lysosome-escape abilities in the cancer cells and higher tumor accumulation in MIA PaCa-2 xenograft model in contrast to PEG-pSL. Conclusion: Cleavable PEGylation is an efficient strategy to ameliorate the PEG dilemma of pSL for cancer drug delivery. ? 2019 Zimei Wu, Manju Kanamala, William R. Wilson, Brian D.

Recent pharmacological research into medicinal mushrooms has identified various therapeutic properties, with applications in modern medicine. Aim: To evaluate the anti-cancer activities of Fomitopsis pinicola (F. pinicola) alcoholic extract in an in vivo setting. Methods: The anti-tumour effect of the F. pinicola extract was tested in a xenograft immune-compromised Rag-1 mouse model. This was followed by RT-PCR and metabolomics analyses. Results: There were no observable differences in tumor growth between treated and non-treated groups. The bioactive components were not detected in the mouse plasma or the tumor site. Conclusions: The extract was poorly absorbed; this is likely due to the timing of treatment, dosage levels and modifications made to the extract where the alcohol-based solvent was replaced with water. This, in combination with fractionation studies which identified most anti-cancer compounds to be hydrophobic, largely explained the lack of anti-cancer activities in vivo. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

Utilizing a critical discursive approach, we identified five interpretative repertoires employed to construct both the viewing of pornography and pornography itself in multiple ways. Our analysis suggests that although pornography remained poorly defined, it was at turns framed as both unnatural and natural to view. The naturalness of viewing pornography however was complicated by an explicit acceptance of pornography addiction, which was variously proposed as being similar to substance abuse, a threat to intimate relationships, and as a convenient excuse. Moreover, the pornography addict was reliably described as male, and implicitly placed within a monogamous heterosexual relationship, with pornography depicted as most threatening when impinging upon such relationships. As such, we argue that the construction of pornography addiction not only reifies morally conservative historical concerns, but also side-lines the ethical and political ramifications of normalized pornography viewership. The possible replacement of discussions about the content of pornography with debates about user effects indicates a rapid historical shift from concerns for community standards to concerns for personal responsibility. ?

Turmoil in the banking and finance sectors led to downturns in stock markets, resulting in bankruptcies, house repossessions and high unemployment. These crises have been shown to be correlated with a deterioration in mental health and an increase in suicides, and it is important to understand the implication of these impacts and how such recessions affect the health of affected populations. With the benefit of hindsight, did lessons learned from the negative effects of the 1997 Asian economic recession impact the aftermath of the 2008 GFC in Asian countries? Utilising a framework based on a simple strata-bootstrap algorithm using daily data–where available–we investigate the trend in suicide rates over time in three different populations (Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea), and examine whether there were any changes in the pattern of suicide rates in each country subsequent to both the 1997 Asian and 2008. We find that each country responded differently to each of the crises and the suicide rates for certain age-gender specific groups in each country were more affected. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",bootstrap confidence interval; coverage probability; standardised rate; Suicide,,2-s2.0-85070335565

Specifically, it examines how Czech TCM practitioners view TCM as universally applicable while fine-tuning it to situated biosocial conditions, experimenting with the compatibilities of various human and plant bodies as part of their generalised, clinical practice. Drawing upon ethnographic research among TCM practitioners in the Czech Republic, it suggests that in addition to the individualization of TCM therapeutics to suit particular patients, Czech TCM is characterised by collective particularization, shaped by local concerns over ethnic, environmental and cultural differences. By looking critically at TCM practitioners’ sensitivities to localised biological similarities and differences it aims to contribute to understandings of the expansion of TCM in Central Europe, as well as more broadly to current social science debates over the risks and opportunities inherent in abandoning the assumption of a universal human body and biology. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Czech Republic; globalisation; Local biologies; situated biologies; Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM),,2-s2.0-85070309857

Methods: A prospective observational study where fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) was completed on consecutive infants who had a history of type 2 ROP and avascular retina during ROP screening that persisted after 45 weeks' post-menstrual age. Results: FFA was completed on 72 eyes of 36 infants (53% male), with a mean gestational age of 26.0 ± 2.2 weeks and a mean birth weight of 834.6 ± 216.3 grams. The mean age at discharge from ROP screening was 47.6 weeks' post-menstrual age. All patients had type 2 ROP at the worst stage of their disease, with predominantly stage 2 disease. FFA was performed at a mean age of 18.8 ± 10.3 months post-menstrual age. All patients had detectable avascular retina in peripheral zone II or III on FFA. Peripheral vessel leakage was present in 3 eyes of 2 infants (5.5%), who both subsequently received peripheral laser treatment.

We employed five healthy and five asthmatic subjects who had dynamic computed tomography (CT) scans (4D CT) along with two static scans at total lung capacity and functional residual capacity. Fractional air-volume change (Vair f ) from 4D CT was used for a validation of the 1D CFD model. We extracted the diameter ratio from existing data sets of 61 healthy subjects for computing mean and standard deviation (SD) of airway constriction/dilation in CT-resolved airways. The lobar mean (SD) of airway constriction/dilation was used to determine diameters of CT-unresolved airways. A 1D isothermal energy balance equation was solved, and pressure boundary conditions were imposed at the acinar region (model A) or at the pleural region (model B). A static compliance model was only applied for model B to link acinar and pleural regions. The values of 1D CFD-derived Vair f for model B demonstrated better correlation with 4D CT-derived Vair f than model A. In both inspiration and expiration, asthmatic subjects with airway constriction show much greater pressure drop than healthy subjects without airway constriction. This increased transpulmonary pressures in the asthmatic subjects, leading to an increased workload (hysteresis). The 1D CFD model was found to be useful in investigating flow structure, lung hysteresis, and pressure distribution for healthy and asthmatic subjects. The derived flow distribution could be used for imposing boundary conditions of 3D CFD. flow distribution could be used for imposing boundary conditions of three-dimensional CFD. ? 2019 American Physiological Society.

Importantly, they are members of the human gastrointestinal microbial population, contributing to the metabolism of dietary and host secreted molecules found in this environment. The role of the microbiota in host digestion is well studied, but the full role of SRB in this process has not been established. Moreover, from a human health perspective, SRB have been implicated in a number of functional gastrointestinal disorders such as Irritable Bowel Syndrome and the development of colorectal cancer. To assist with the study of SRB, we present a mathematical model for the growth and metabolism of the well-studied SRB, Desulfovibrio vulgaris in a closed system. Previous attempts to model SRB have resulted in complex or highly specific models that are not easily adapted to the study of SRB in different environments, such as the gastrointestinal tract. We propose a simpler, Monod-based model that allows for easy alteration of both key parameter values and the governing equations to enable model adaptation. To prevent any incorrect assumptions about the nature of SRB metabolic pathways, we structure the model to consider only the concentrations of initial and final metabolites in a pathway, which circumvents the current uncertainty around hydrogen cycling by SRB. We parameterise our model using experiments with varied initial substrate conditions, obtaining parameter values that compare well with experimental estimates in the literature. We then validate our model against four independent experiments involving D. vulgaris with further variations to substrate availability. Further use of the model will be possible in a number of settings, notably as part of larger models studying the metabolic interactions between SRB and other hydrogenotrophic microbes in the human gastrointestinal tract and how this relates to functional disorders.

Although it is sometimes used to assess suicide risk, most positive responses are not associated with suicidality. The PHQ-8, which omits Item 9, is thus increasingly used in research. We assessed equivalency of total score correlations and the diagnostic accuracy to detect major depression of the PHQ-8 and PHQ-9.MethodsWe conducted an individual patient data meta-analysis. We fit bivariate random-effects models to assess diagnostic accuracy.Results16 742 participants (2097 major depression cases) from 54 studies were included. The correlation between PHQ-8 and PHQ-9 scores was 0.996 (95% confidence interval 0.996 to 0.996). The standard cutoff score of 10 for the PHQ-9 maximized sensitivity + specificity for the PHQ-8 among studies that used a semi-structured diagnostic interview reference standard (N = 27). At cutoff 10, the PHQ-8 was less sensitive by 0.02 (-0.06 to 0.00) and more specific by 0.01 (0.00 to 0.01) among those studies (N = 27), with similar results for studies that used other types of interviews (N = 27). For all 54 primary studies combined, across all cutoffs, the PHQ-8 was less sensitive than the PHQ-9 by 0.00 to 0.05 (0.03 at cutoff 10), and specificity was within 0.01 for all cutoffs (0.00 to 0.01).ConclusionsPHQ-8 and PHQ-9 total scores were similar. Sensitivity may be minimally reduced with the PHQ-8, but specificity is similar. Copyright ?

The reversal of the pH gradient across the plasma membrane in cells that regulate intracellular pH (pHi) has potential to drive the selective uptake of weak acids at low extracellular pH (pHe). Here, we investigate the dual targeting of low pHe and hypoxia, another key feature of tumor microenvironments. We prepared eight bioreductive prodrugs based on the benzotriazine di-oxide (BTO) nucleus by appending alkanoic or aminoalkanoic acid sidechains. The BTO acids showed modest selectivity for both low pHe (pH 6.5 versus 7.4, ratios 2 to 5-fold) and anoxia (ratios 2 to 8-fold) in SiHa and FaDu cell cultures. Related neutral BTOs were not selective for acidosis, but had greater cytotoxic potency and hypoxic selectivity than the BTO acids. Investigation of the uptake and metabolism of representative BTO acids confirmed enhanced uptake at low pHe, but lower intracellular concentrations than expected for passive diffusion. Further, the modulation of intracellular reductase activity and competition by the cell-excluded electron acceptor WST-1 suggests that the majority of metabolic reductions of BTO acids occur at the cell surface, compromising the engagement of the resulting free radicals with intracellular targets. Thus, the present study provides support for designing bioreductive prodrugs that exploit pH-dependent partitioning, suggesting, however, that that the approach should be applied to prodrugs with obligate intracellular activation. ? 2019 by the authors.",Benzotriazine di-oxides; Bioreductive prodrugs; CEN-209; Chlorambucil; PH-dependent partitioning; Radical chemistry; SN30000; Tirapazamine; Tumor acidosis; Tumor hypoxia; WST-1,"oxide; prodrug; triazine derivative; biological model; cell hypoxia; chemical phenomena; chemical structure; chemistry; dose response; drug design; drug effect; human; metabolism; neoplasm; oxidation reduction reaction; pH; tumor cell line; Cell Hypoxia; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemical Phenomena; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Design; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Models, Biological; Molecular Structure; Neoplasms; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxides; Prodrugs; Triazines",2-s2.0-85068895010

Few studies, however, have enabled older people to define these concepts in their own terms. This paper based on research in Aotearoa, New Zealand is the first to comparatively outline the meanings of loneliness and social isolation from the perspective of four ethnically diverse groups of older adults (M?ori, Pacific, Asian, and NZ European). Method: We interviewed 44 older people and conducted three focus groups with 32 older people. We used thematic and narrative analyses. Results: Loneliness and social isolation were conceptualized as interconnected concepts described as a ‘look and feel’, a ‘state of mind’ and as a ‘lack of desired companionship’. Participants conveyed sophisticated understandings of the structural underpinnings of both loneliness and social isolation as multi-dimensional, complex, and situated. Conclusions: Older people describe complex and culturally- nuanced understanding and experience of social isolation and loneliness. More culturally appropriate services, greater mental-health support and more service provision on weekends and evenings are needed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",experience; Loneliness; multicultural; older adults; social isolation; understanding,aged; article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; loneliness; male; mental health; narrative; New Zealand; social isolation,2-s2.0-85068533266

The headspace awareness campaigns are designed to address these factors. Aims: To examine whether distance from a headspace centre affects community awareness of headspace, and whether general awareness of headspace changed between 2008 and 2015. Method: Responses from 4707 participants aged 12–25 years, collected in 2008 and 2015, were analysed. The effect of headspace centre location on awareness of services was assessed by comparing awareness between those living in headspace areas (within 20 km of a centre) and those who were not. Change in awareness between 2008 and 2015 was assessed. Results: Awareness of headspace and its services was significantly greater among those living in headspace areas than among those living further away. Within headspace areas, awareness increased by 27% between 2008 and 2015. Prompted and unprompted awareness were significantly greater in 2015 than in 2008. Conclusions: Awareness of headspace has increased over time; however, innovative awareness campaigns are needed for those residing in non-headspace areas. Continued funding to increase headspace’s national coverage, improving mental health literacy and service access for youth and their families, particularly those living in non-headspace areas, is needed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Awareness; headspace; help-seeking; mental health; youth,adolescent; adult; article; awareness; child; female; funding; human; human experiment; juvenile; literacy; major clinical study; male; mental health service; school child,2-s2.0-85068208676

As evidence examining maternal circulating choline concentrations and offspring body composition in human infants/children is lacking, we investigated this in two cohorts. Methods: Maternal choline concentrations were measured in the UK Southampton Women's Survey (SWS; serum, n ? 985, 11 weeks' gestation) and Singapore Growing Up Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO); n ? 955, 26-28 weeks' gestation) mother-offspring cohorts. Offspring anthropometry was measured at birth and up to age 5 years. Body fat mass was determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at birth and age 4 years for SWS; and using air-displacement plethysmography at birth and age 5 years for GUSTO. Linear-regression analyses were performed, adjusting for confounders. Results: In SWS, higher maternal choline concentrations were associated with higher neonatal total body fat mass {b ? 0.60 standard deviation [SD]/5 mmol/L maternal choline [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-1.16]} and higher subscapular skinfold thickness [b ? 0.55 mm/5 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.12-1.00)] at birth. In GUSTO, higher maternal choline concentrations were associated with higher neonatal body mass index-for-age z-score [b ? 0.31 SD/5 mmol/L (0.10-0.51)] and higher triceps [b ? 0.38 mm/5 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.11-0.65)] and subscapular skinfold thicknesses [b ? 0.26 mm/5 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.01-0.50)] at birth. No consistent trends were observed between maternal choline and offspring gain in body mass index, skinfold thicknesses, abdominal circumference, weight, length/ height and adiposity measures in later infancy and early childhood. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that maternal circulating choline concentrations during pregnancy are positively associated with offspring BMI, skinfold thicknesses and adiposity at birth, but not with growth and adiposity through infancy and early childhood to the age of 5 years. ?

Using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format, we undertook four systematic reviews. For children with chronic cough (> 4-weeks duration) and without underlying lung disease: (1) who do not have gastrointestinal GER symptoms, should empirical treatment for GERD be used? (2) with gastrointestinal GER symptoms, does treatment for GERD resolve the cough? (3) with or without gastrointestinal GER symptoms, what GER-based therapies should be used and for how long? (4) if GERD is suspected as the cause, what investigations and diagnostic criteria best determine GERD as the cause of the cough? METHODS: We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol and American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus. RESULTS: Few randomized controlled trials addressed the first two questions and none addressed the other two. The single meta-analysis (two randomized controlled trials) showed no significant difference between the groups (any intervention for GERD vs placebo for cough resolution; OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.45-2.93; P ?.78). Proton pump inhibitors (vs placebo) caused increased serious adverse events. Qualitative data from existing CHEST cough systematic reviews were consistent with two international GERD guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The panelists endorsed that: (1) treatment(s) for GERD should not be used when there are no clinical features of GERD; and (2) pediatric GERD guidelines should be used to guide treatment and investigations.

The morphological differences between participants with risk factors for cardiovascular disease were tested using a logistic regression model. The result was compared to a model built from traditional mass and volume measures, and the strength of associations were tested using a Delong’s test.

Methods: Formation of a multicultural, international, and interdisciplinary collaborative research team, funded by the Worldwide Universities Network. The goal is to design a multi-strand research program to develop flexible and accessible approaches to health education for musicians, thus improving their health literacy. Results: Two team meetings took place in 2018. The first was held 11 to 15 April 2018 in Perth, Australia, and involved a review of existing literature and interventions on health education in music schools, intensive development of research topics, aims, and methodologies, and identification of potential funding sources to support future large-scale research programs. This resulted in the draft design of three research projects, finalized during a second meeting in Maastricht, the Netherlands, 27 to 31 August 2018. Discussion: These intensive meetings identified the need for both cultural change in music education settings as well as improved health literacy in musicians across global geographical regions. A global project to address health literacy and health education accessibility for musicians has commenced. ? 2019 Science & Medicine.",,article; Australia; funding; health literacy; human; human experiment; music; musician; Netherlands; systematic review; music; university; Australia; Health Literacy; Humans; Music; Netherlands; Universities,2-s2.0-85067107148

Moreover, this translocation is detected in 50% of T-ALL patients with gamma/delta T cell receptor rearrangement, frequently associated with low expression of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). However, the relevance of CEBPA low expression for CALM/AF10 leukemogenesis has not yet been evaluated. We generated double mutant mice, which express the Lck-CALM/AF10 fusion gene and are haploinsufficient for the Cebpa gene. To characterize the hematopoiesis, we quantified hematopoietic stem cells, myeloid progenitor cells, megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells, common myeloid progenitor cells, and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells. No significant difference was detected in any of the progenitor subsets. Finally, we tested if Cebpa haploinsufficiency would lead to the expansion of Mac-1+/B220+/c-Kit+ cells proposed as the CALM/AF10 leukemic progenitor. Less than 1% of bone marrow cells expressed Mac-1, B220, and c-Kit with no significant difference between groups. Our results showed that the reduction of Cebpa gene expression in Lck-CALM/AF10 mice did not affect their hematopoiesis or induce leukemia. Our data corroborated previous studies suggesting that the CALM/AF10 leukemia-initiating cells are early progenitors with lymphoid/myeloid differentiating potential. ? 2019, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

New drug targets include various enzymes in the electron transport pathway that are critical for maintaining growth and survival of the causative bacterium. Following approval of the ATP synthase inhibitor bedaquiline, a large number of compounds with activity against these enzymes have been identified, and a few drug candidates were recently developed that are close to or have already commenced clinical trials. Such progress is indeed promising, although the predominant focus on just three targets (NADH dehydrogenase-2, QcrB in the cytochrome bc1-aa3 supercomplex, and ATP synthase) may need to be reconsidered in light of recent findings.

We aimed to investigate the associations between putative colorectal cancer-related markers and total protein intake, plant and animal proteins, and protein from red and processed meat in pre-diabetic adults (> 25?years). Methods: Analyses were based on clinical and dietary assessments at baseline and after 1?year of intervention. Protein intake was assessed from 4-day dietary records. Putative colorectal cancer-related markers identified from 24-h faecal samples collected over three consecutive days were: concentration of short-chain fatty acids, phenols, ammonia, and pH. Results: In total, 79 participants were included in the analyses. We found a positive association between change in total protein intake (slope: 74.72 ± 28.84??mol per g faeces/E%, p = 0.01), including animal protein intake (slope: 87.63 ± 32.04??mol per g faeces/E%, p = 0.009), and change in faecal ammonia concentration. For change in ammonia, there was a dose–response trend from the most negative (lowest tertile) to the most positive (highest tertile) association (p = 0.01): in the high tertile, a change in intake of red meat was positively associated with an increase in ammonia excretion (slope: 2.0 ± 0.5??mol per g faeces/g/day, p < 0.001), whereas no such association was found in the low and medium tertile groups. Conclusion: Increases in total and animal protein intakes were associated with higher excretion of ammonia in faeces after 1?year in overweight pre-diabetic adults undertaking a weight-loss intervention. An increase in total or relative protein intake, or in the ratio of animal to plant protein, was not associated with an increase in faeces of any of the other putative colorectal cancer risk markers.

The T antigen, a protein that polymerizes to form the backbone of the GAS pilus structure, is a potential vaccine candidate. Previous surveys of the tee gene, which encodes the T antigen, have identified 21 different tee types and subtypes such that any T antigen-based vaccine must be multivalent and carefully designed to provide broad strain coverage. In this study, the crystal structures of three two-domain T antigens (T3.2, T13, and T18.1) were determined and found to have remarkable structural similarity to the previously reported T1 antigen, despite moderate overall sequence similarity. This has enabled reliable modeling of all major two-domain T antigens to reveal that T antigen sequence variation is distributed along the full length of the protein and shields a highly conserved core. Immunoassays performed with sera from immunized animals and commercial T-typing sera identified a significant cross-reactive antibody response between T18.1, T18.2, T3.2, and T13. The existence of shared epitopes between T antigens, combined with the remarkably conserved structure and high level of surface sequence divergence, has important implications for the design of multivalent T antigen-based vaccines.

The issue has a multitude of pathways through which it has percolated into the everyday lives of all communities across the world, affecting health as a whole. This has made the environmental health threat one of the most substantial and formidable of the 21st century. These consequences will be unequally felt across the world, as some of the nations least responsible for these changes will become the most vulnerable to the new challenges. Indigenous communities across the globe are among the most vulnerable to this great inequity. One of those groups is the Indigenous Maori population of Aotearoa/New Zealand, which will have to struggle with a new set of challenges to health and well-being. The inequity has and will continue to exacerbate already difficult circumstances experienced by Maori communities. Some of the direct and indirect outcomes include increased exposure and impacts of more extreme weather events such as flooding, cyclones, and fires; increased exposure to disease-causing agents; and long-lasting social impacts such as disruption of access to health care, adverse mental health effects; and housing, food security, and socio-economic stresses. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.",,Food supply; Health risks; Storms; Environmental health; Extreme weather events; Food security; Indigenous community; Mental health; Population health; Social impact; Socio-economics; Climate change,2-s2.0-85066449803

However, evidence regarding how well used, and acceptable, these resources are is lacking. Aims: To investigate the views about and experiences with support and resources of people with lived experience of suicide bereavement, suicide attempt, or caring. Method: The study was conducted in Queensland, Australia. In total, 175 people completed the survey. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22. Results: Participants found resources helpful and user-friendly, but many had never searched for support, did not know it was available, or felt no better after using it. Respondents who had attempted suicide were more likely to look for resources, but less likely to feel better after using them and endorsed more barriers to accessing support. Limitations: This study used a convenience sample of individuals living in Queensland, was biased toward help-seeking populations, and included mostly women, and therefore it was not representative. Conclusion: Support and resources that are more flexible and accessible, and are offered in a more proactive manner could improve the user experiences of people affected by suicide-related behavior. ? 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",bereavement; caring; postvention; resources; suicide attempt,,2-s2.0-85066438461

Oxygen-sensitive activation of evofosfamide depends on one-electron reduction, yet the reductases that catalyze this process in tumors are unknown. We used RNA sequencing, whole-genome CRISPR knockout, and reductase-focused short hairpin RNA screens to interrogate modifiers of evofosfamide activation in cancer cell lines. Involvement of mitochondrial electron transport in the activation of evofosfamide and the related nitroaromatic compounds EF5 and FSL-61 was investigated using 143B r0 (r zero) cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA and biochemical assays in UT-SCC-74B cells. The potency of evofosfamide in 30 genetically diverse cancer cell lines correlated with the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial electron transfer. A whole-genome CRISPR screen in KBM-7 cells identified the DNA damage-response factors SLX4IP, C10orf90 (FATS), and SLFN11, in addition to the key regulator of mitochondrial function, YME1L1, and several complex I constituents as modifiers of evofosfamide sensitivity. A reductase-focused shRNA screen in UT-SCC-74B cells similarly identified mitochondrial respiratory chain factors. Surprisingly, 143B r0 cells showed enhanced evofosfamide activation and sensitivity but had global transcriptional changes, including increased expression of nonmitochondrial flavoreductases. In UT-SCC-74B cells, evofosfamide oxidized cytochromes a, b, and c and inhibited respiration at complexes I, II, and IV without quenching reactive oxygen species production. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial electron transport chain contributes to evofosfamide activation and that predicting evofosfamide sensitivity in patients by measuring the expression of canonical bioreductive enzymes such as cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase is likely to be futile.

Current study investigated the replacement of rice flour and its effect on product properties using extrusion technology. Materials and Methods: High selenium yam and konjac flours were used to increase fibre and selenium contents, whereas sorghum and soy protein were added to improve protein content as well as textural properties of product. The following variables were optimized: yam flour (20% to 60%), feed moisture content (25% to 35%), and extrusion temperature (100°C to 120°C) by evaluating the breaking strength, firmness, colour, bulk density, and water absorption index (WAI) of the extruded products. Results: Results show that the extrusion temperature has a significant relationship with the products’ breaking strength, WAI, and bulk density, whereas the feed moisture content influenced the WAI, bulk density, and firmness (P < 0.05). The inclusion of yam flour significantly increased the firmness and yellowness (b* value) of the products (P < 0.05). Sensory profiling revealed that the enriched product has comparable textural properties (stickiness, firmness, and graininess) with the commercial rice. Comparing with commercial rice, the enriched product has significantly higher antioxidant activity (163.53 vs. 10.33 μmol Trolox/100 g, DPPH assay), protein (13.4% vs. 9.4%), fibre (12% resistant starch, 9% glucomannan), and a lower GI value (69.6 vs. 95.4). The enriched product also contains 15.62 ?g/100 g selenium, providing additional health benefit as Se-enriched functional food. Conclusions: This work has demonstrated the suitability of applying extrusion to produce a healthier alternative rice product by nutrient enrichment via rice flour substitution. ? The Author(s) 2019.

These delays occur at three levels i.e. delay in making decision to seek care, delay in access to care, and delay in receiving care. Factors that cause delays are therefore need to be understand to prevent and avoid these delays to improve health and survival of mothers and babies. ?? Methods: A systematic review of observational and qualitative studies to identify factors and barriers associated with delays in health care seeking. Results: A total of 159 observational and qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. The review of observational and qualitative studies identified social, cultural and health services factors that contribute to delays in health care seeking, and influence decisions to seek care. Timely recognition of danger signs, availability of finances to arrange for transport and affordability of health care cost, and accessibility to a health facility were some of these factors. Conclusions: Effective dealing of factors that contribute to delays in health care seeking would lead to significant improvements in mortality, morbidity and care seeking outcomes, particularly in countries that share a major brunt of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality.

The secondary aim was to evaluate if malnutrition risk and BMI were associated with chemotherapy outcomes (discontinuation/modification of treatment) in older patients with solid tumours. Methods: Older patients (aged ?70 years) with solid cancers were recruited from the outpatient oncology clinic of a tertiary hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Participants’ nutritional parameters, BMI, and malnutrition risk (determined using the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST)) were recorded at baseline. Mortality data and chemotherapy outcomes were recorded for 12 months. Results: Seventy-four participants (67% males, median age 77 (±4.4) years) were recruited. Nearly half the cohort was at-risk of malnutrition at baseline (n = 39, 46%). Chemotherapy was prescribed to 39% (n = 29) of the cohort. For patients receiving chemotherapy neither being underweight nor having a low or medium risk of malnutrition was associated with adverse chemotherapy outcomes or 12-month mortality. At a bivariate level, malnutrition risk was significantly associated with 12-month mortality in patients who did not receive chemotherapy (P = 0.018), but not BMI. Conclusions: This analysis indicates that malnutrition risk was a potential indicator of 12-month mortality in cases where chemotherapy was considered unfeasible. However, this was not an independent risk factor. Further investigation using a larger sample is required to determine the association between malnutrition risk, quality of life and mortality in patients who are not considered to be fit for chemotherapy. ? 2019 Dietitians Association of Australia",aged; body mass index; chemotherapy; geriatric assessment; malnutrition; neoplasms,,2-s2.0-85065411941

While no clinically effective vaccines against gonorrhea have been developed we present direct and indirect evidence that a vaccine is not only possible, but may already exist. Experience from Cuba, New Zealand, and Canada suggest that vaccines containing Group B Neisseria meningitides outer membrane vesicles (OMV) developed to control type-specific meningococcal disease may also prevent a significant proportion of gonorrhea. The mechanisms for this phenomenon have not yet been elucidated but we present some strategies for unraveling potential cross protective antigens and effector immune responses by exploiting stored sera from clinical trials and individuals primed with a meningococcal group B OMV vaccine (MeNZB). Elucidating these will contribute to the ongoing development of high efficacy vaccine options for gonorrhea. While the vaccine used in New Zealand, where the strongest empirical evidence has been gathered, is no longer available, the OMV has been included in the multi component recombinant meningococcal vaccine 4CMenB (Bexsero) which is now licensed and used in numerous countries. Several lines of evidence suggest it has the potential to affect gonorrhea prevalence. A vaccine to control gonorrhea does not need to be perfect and modeling supports that even a moderately efficacious vaccine could make a significant impact in disease prevalence. How might we use an off the shelf vaccine to reduce the burden of gonorrhea? What are some of the potential societal barriers in a world where vaccine hesitancy is growing? We summarize the evidence and consider some of the remaining questions.

Odour tests currently on the market utilise the orthonasal route, though the retronasal route is a viable, but overlooked, alternative. In this study, a flavour delivery system has been developed which quickly dissolves in the buccal cavity, rapidly releasing flavours that reach the olfactory system by the retronasal route. We tested seven different types of retronasal flavour stimuli (peppermint, aniseed, liquorice, coffee, orange, lemon, and valeric acid) on 171 undergraduate and postgraduate university students and related perceptual measures with psychological wellbeing scores. Olfactory measures included odour identification, pleasantness, intensity, and familiarity. Psychological measures of schizotypy (SPQ-B), depression, stress and anxiety (DASS-21), and autism spectrum disorder (RAADS-R) were obtained to represent psychological wellbeing. A battery of hierarchical multiple linear regressions were run to determine the relationships between odour perception and the psychometric measures. After controlling for age and gender, significant negative associations were found between odour identification and the stress (β = ?.347, p <.001), anxiety (β = ?.376, p <.001), depression (β = ?.318, p <.001), schizotypy (β = ?.473, p <.001), and RAADS-R (β = ?.285, p <.001) scales. Additionally, both overall pleasantness (β = ?.203, p <.01) and intensity (β =.194, p <.05) ratings were negatively correlated to the RAADS-R. Our findings indicate that retronasal stimuli present a feasible alternative to olfactory assessment of psychological states and further reinforces evidence indicating a correlation between olfactory and psychological measures. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Identification; Odour; Olfaction; Perception; Psychopathology; Retronasal,,2-s2.0-85064923428

A retrospective cohort study from 2006 to 2015 was conducted that linked de-identified data from government sources using Statistic NZ’s Integrated Data Infrastructure. VPD-related hospitalisations were compared between three cohorts of children from birth to 5?years old: foreign-born children who migrated to NZ, children born in NZ of recent migrant mothers, and a comparator group of children born in NZ without a recent migration background. VPD-related hospitalisation rates were higher among NZ-born non-migrant children compared to NZ-born migrant and foreign-born children for all of the diseases of interest. For instance, 5.21% of NZ-born non-migrant children were hospitalised at least once due to all-cause gastroenteritis compared to 4.47% of NZ-born migrant children and only 1.13% of foreign-born migrant children. The overall hospitalisation rate for NZ-born non-migrant children was 3495 hospitalisations per 100,000 person years. Among children with migrant backgrounds, higher hospitalisation rates were noted among those of Pacific ethnicity and those with refugee backgrounds. Those arriving on Pacific visa schemes were hospitalised at rates ranging from 2644/100,000 person years among foreign-born migrant children and 4839/100,000 person years among NZ-born migrant children. Foreign-born quota refugee children and NZ-born children of quota refugee mothers were hospitalised at a rate of 4000–5000/100,000 person years. It is important to disaggregate migrant data to improve our understanding of migrant health. Children need to be age-appropriately vaccinated, and other individual and environmental factors addressed, to reduce the risk of infectious diseases. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Children; Data-linking; Migrant; Refugee; Vaccine-preventable disease,,2-s2.0-85064265739

Human studies are limited and constrained by a range of factors which do not apply to preclinical research. Animal models therefore offer a unique opportunity to fully investigate the mechanisms associated with developmental programming, helping to elucidate the developmental processes which influence reproductive diseases, and highlight potential biomarkers which can be translated back to the human condition. This review covers the use and limitations of a number of animal models frequently utilised in developmental programming investigations, with an emphasis on dietary manipulations which can lead to reproductive dysfunction in offspring. ?

Limited advances in maternal and perinatal health in recent decades with respect to preventing these disorders have led to new approaches, and “omics” sciences have emerged as a potential field to be explored. Metabolomics is the study of a set of metabolites in a given sample and can represent the metabolic functioning of a cell, tissue or organism. Metabolomics has some advantages over genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, as metabolites are the final result of the interactions of genes, RNAs and proteins. Considering the recent “boom” in metabolomic studies and their importance in the research agenda, we here review the topic, explaining the rationale and theory of the metabolomic approach in different areas of maternal and perinatal health research for clinical practitioners. We also demonstrate the main exploratory studies of these maternal complications, commenting on their promising findings. The potential translational application of metabolomic studies, especially for the identification of predictive biomarkers, is supported by the current findings, although they require external validation in larger datasets and with alternative methodologies. ? 2019 CLINICS.",Maternal health (MeSH); Metabolomics (MeSH); Prediction; Translational medical research (MeSH),"biological marker; female; human; maternal welfare; metabolism; metabolomics; newborn; perinatal care; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prematurity; procedures; prognosis; third trimester pregnancy; translational research; trends; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health; Metabolomics; Perinatal Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Premature Birth; Prognosis; Translational Medical Research",2-s2.0-85063932976

However, concern is raised by ethics committees, maternity providers and families, when pregnant and bereaved women are approached to participate. Our aim was to 1) assess factors influencing recruitment in a multicentre case-control stillbirth study and 2) gain insight into how women felt about their participation. Methods: Eligible women were contacted through maternity providers from seven New Zealand health regions in 2011-2015. Cases had a recent singleton non-anomalous late stillbirth (?28 weeks’ gestation). Controls were randomly selected and matched for region and gestation. Participants were interviewed by a research midwife and given a feedback form asking their views about participation. Feedback was evaluated using thematic analysis. Results: 169 (66.5%) of 254 eligible cases and 569 (62.2%) of 915 eligible controls were recruited. Non-participants consisted of 263 (22.5% of eligible) women who declined, 108 (9.2% of eligible) uncontactable women, and 60 (5.1% of eligible) women declined by the maternity provider, with no significant differences between the proportion of non-participating cases and controls in each of these three categories. The majority (63.2%) of women did not provide a specific reason for non-participation. Written feedback was provided by 111 participants (cases 15.3%, controls 14.9%) and all described their involvement positively. Feedback themes identified were ‘motivation to participate,’ ‘ease of participation,’ and ‘post-participation positivity.’ Conclusion: Identification of recruitment barriers and our reassuring participant feedback may assist women's participation in future research and support progress towards stillbirth prevention. ? 2019 The Authors",Feedback; Pregnant women; Research participation; Research recruitment; Stillbirth,adult; article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; midwife; motivation; multicenter study; New Zealand; pregnancy; pregnant woman; randomized controlled trial; stillbirth; thematic analysis,2-s2.0-85063757535

Background: This study evaluates the nationwide incidence, demographics and visual outcomes of children with ocular injury in New Zealand. Design: Nationwide retrospective review. Participants: All children in New Zealand aged 0 to 17 years from 2007 to 2016 with ocular injury requiring assessment by a medical practitioner. Methods: New Zealand national and regional datasets were used to evaluate population-level statistics for ocular injury over a 10-year period. Visual and clinical outcome data were assessed using a randomized sample of 150 patients. Main Outcome Measures: Annual incidence, aetiology, demographics, injury location, visual outcomes, protective eyewear use, surgical intervention and follow-up. Results: A national total of 75 601 cases were included with a mean incidence of 719/100 000 children/year. Cases were predominantly male (63.2%) and of New Zealand-European ethnicity (60.8%), aged 0 to 4 years (30.66%).

In such settings, the two-phase design provides a way forward by first stratifying an initial (large) phase I sample on the basis of covariates readily available (including, possibly, the outcome), and sub-sampling participants at phase II to collect the expensive measure(s). When the outcome of interest is binary, several methods have been proposed for estimation and inference for the parameters of a logistic regression model, including weighted likelihood, pseudo-likelihood and maximum likelihood. Although these methods yield consistent estimation and valid inference, they do so solely on the basis of the phase I stratification and the detailed covariate information obtained at phase II. Moreover, they ignore any additional information that is readily available at phase I but was not used as part of the stratified sampling design. Motivated by the potential for efficiency gains, especially concerning parameters corresponding to the additional phase I covariates, we propose a novel augmented pseudo-likelihood estimator for two-phase studies that makes use of all available information. In contrast to recently-proposed weighted likelihood-based methods that calibrate to the influence function of the model of interest, the methods we propose do not require the development of additional models and, therefore, enjoy a degree of robustness. In addition, we expand the broader framework for pseudo-likelihood based estimation and inference to permit link functions for binary regression other than the logit link. Comprehensive simulations, based on a one-time cross sectional survey of 82,887 patients undergoing anti-retroviral therapy in Malawi between 2005 and 2007, illustrate finite sample properties of the proposed methods and compare their performance competing approaches. The proposed method yields the lowest standard errors when the model is correctly specified. Finally, the methods are applied to a large implementation science project examining the effect of an enhanced community health worker program to improve adherence to WHO guidelines for at least four antenatal visits, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. ?

Methods: Healthy children from the GUSTO (Growing Up in Singapore Toward healthy Outcomes) cohort participated in repeated neurodevelopmental assessments between 6 and 54?months. For “nutrients”, we compared children exclusively bottle-fed according to type of milk received: formula only (n = 296) vs some/all breast milk (n = 73). For “nursing”, we included only children who were fully fed breast milk, comparing those fed directly at the breast (n = 59) vs those fed partially/completely by bottle (n = 63). Results: Compared to infants fed formula only, those who were bottle-fed breast milk demonstrated significantly better cognitive performance on both the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Third Edition) at 2?years [adjusted mean difference (95% CI) 1.36 (0.32, 2.40)], and on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (Second Edition) at 4.5?years [7.59 (1.20, 13.99)]. Children bottle-fed breast milk also demonstrated better gross motor skills at 2?years than those fed formula [1.60 (0.09, 3.10)]. Among infants fully fed breast milk, those fed directly at the breast scored higher on several memory tasks compared to children bottle-fed breast milk, including the deferred imitation task at 6?months [0.67 (0.02, 1.32)] and relational binding tasks at 6 [0.41 (0.07, 0.74)], 41 [0.67 (0.04, 1.29)] and 54 [0.12 (0.01, 0.22)] months.

Methods: A sampling frame was compiled from funding announcements, trial registers and HSR organisation membership. Listed researchers were invited to complete online surveys. Close-ended survey items were analysed using basic descriptive statistics. Goodness of fit tests determined potential associations between researcher affiliation and access to resources for HSR. Open-ended survey items were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: In all, 424 researchers participated in the study (22% response rate). Respondents held roles as health service researchers (76%), educators (34%) and health professionals (19%). Most were employed by a university (64%), and 57% held a permanent contract. Although 63% reported network support for HSR, smaller proportions reported executive (48%) or financial (26%) support. The least accessible resources were economists (52%), consumers (49%) and practice change experts (34%) researchers affiliated with health services were less likely to report access to statisticians (P < 0.001), economists (P < 0.001), librarians (P = 0.02) and practice change experts (P = 0.02) than university-affiliated researchers. Common impacts included conference presentations (94%), publication of peer-reviewed articles (87%) and health professional benefits (77%). Qualitative data emphasised barriers such as embedding research culture within services and engaging with policy makers. Conclusions: The data highlight opportunities to sustain the HSR community through dedicated funding, improved access to methodological expertise and greater engagement with end-users. What is known about the topic?: HSR faces several challenges, such as inequitable funding allocation and difficulties in quantifying the effects of HSR on changing health policy or practice. What does this paper add?: Despite a vibrant and experienced HSR community, this study highlights some key barriers to realising a greater effect on the health and well-being of Australian and New Zealand communities through HSR. These barriers include limited financial resources, methodological expertise, organisational support and opportunities to engage with potential collaborators. What are the implications for practitioners?: Funding is required to develop HSR infrastructure, support collaboration between health services and universities and combine knowledge of the system with research experience and expertise. Formal training programs for health service staff and researchers, from short courses to PhD programs, will support broader interest and involvement in HSR. ? 2020 AHHA Open Access.",,adult; article; Australia and New Zealand; consumer; economist; embedding; female; funding; health care policy; health practitioner; health services research; human; human experiment; librarian; male; publication; quantitative analysis; sampling; staff; statistician; statistics; systematic review; thematic analysis; training; wellbeing,2-s2.0-85061998124

Nineteen biomarkers on 155 patients with hepatitis from the University California Irvine Machine Learning repository were used as input data. Weights derived by applying the geometric margin maximisation criterion of a Lagrangian support vector machine (LSVM) were used for selecting the features associated with the highest relative importance towards the required classification, i.e. to predict whether a patient with hepatitis would have survived or died. Thus, the 19 initial features were reduced to the 16 most important prognostic factors and were fed into various AI-based classifiers. Results indicated an overall classification accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 100% for the proposed hybrid algorithm, the LSVM multilayer perceptron (MLP), thus demonstrating its potential for aiding prediction of prognosis in patients with hepatitis in a clinical setting. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",Decision support; Hepatitis; Multilayer perceptron; Prognosis,Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Multilayer neural networks; Multilayers; Classification accuracy; Decision supports; Hepatitis; Hybrid artificial intelligences; Lagrangian support vector machines; Machine learning repository; Prognosis; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Diagnosis,2-s2.0-85061737855

The global literature is not a good indicator of the actual proportion of health informaticians, health information managers, health librarians or other health professionals who are engaged in health information work in Australia.

However, administration of potent NKT cell agonists like α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) can be associated with release of high levels of cytokines, and in some situations, hepatotoxicity. Here we show that it is possible to provoke sufficient NKT cell activity to stimulate strong antigen-specific T cell responses without these unwanted effects. This was achieved by chemically conjugating antigenic peptides to α-galactosylphytosphingosine (α-GalPhs), an NKT cell agonist with very weak activity based on structural characterisation and biological assays. Conjugation improved delivery to antigen-presenting cells in vivo, while use of a cathepsin-sensitive linker to release the α-GalPhs and peptide within the same cell promoted strong T cell activation and therapeutic anti-tumour responses in mice. The conjugates activated human NKT cells and enhanced human T cell responses to a viral peptide in vitro. Accordingly, we have demonstrated a means to safely exploit the immunostimulatory properties of NKT cells to enhance T cell activation for virus- and tumour-specific immunity. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Antigens; Chemical activation; Mammals; Peptides; T-cells; Tumors; Viruses; Activity-based; Antigen presenting cells; Antigenic peptides; Biological assays; Hepatotoxicity; T cell activation; T-cell response; Viral peptides; Cytology; cancer vaccine; CD1d antigen; CD1d antigen, mouse; epitope; glycolipid; immunological adjuvant; peptide; animal; antigen presenting cell; C57BL mouse; chemistry; drug effect; experimental neoplasm; immunology; lymphocyte activation; mouse; natural killer T cell; toxic hepatitis; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Animals; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Antigens, CD1d; Cancer Vaccines; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Epitopes; Glycolipids; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Natural Killer T-Cells; Neoplasms, Experimental; Peptides",2-s2.0-85060920827

From the point of view of many medicinal chemists, tractable hit matter is one of the most important parts in such a project. Without quality hits the projects grind to a halt and no further progress is possible, no matter how promising the modulation of the said biological target is for a novel therapeutic approach. This is obviously a very frustrating experience for all of the scientists involved and often the projects are simply discontinued. Perhaps borne out of this frustration an array of different screening approaches have been developed to mitigate the problem of no or poor quality hit matter, i.e., the more techniques available for hit generation the better since each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. In this special issue “Hit Generation and Verification for Novel Lead Compounds” (https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules/special_issues/novel_lead_compounds), the focus was on this crucial part of the drug discovery pathway and it is pertinent to keep in mind that the chain is as strong as its weakest link. In the special issue a range of different hit generation methods were reported such as the marriage of the classical methods of natural products with structure based virtual screening, which were successfully reported to identify cannabinoid receptor 1 inverse agonists for treating obesity [1] and the generation of potent inhibitors of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1, a promising anticancer target [2]. A fragment based screen was reported against the FIXa target for blood anticoagulation [3], high content screen using zebrafish for cardiovascular issues focusing on the Fgf/Ras/Mapk activity was reported [4] and finally an in vitro/in silico method was introduced for the modulation of the Partial PPARγ receptor for the treatment of diabetes [5]. Additionally, more classical structural activity relationships studies were reported such as cationic non-peptic small molecules as membrane disruptors as antimicrobial agents [6] and the synthesis of proanthocyanidin derivatives as generally interesting bioactive compounds [7]. Lastly, two reports on the anticancer compound class thieno [2,3-b] pyridines were introduced where two major issues of small molecular drug discovery were addressed, the lack of aqueous solubility [8] and the identification of the molecular targets modulated by the molecules [9]. In the reported projects either natural products, and their derivatives, or synthetic small molecules are used as screening collections, i.e., very different regions of chemical space are explored. In general, the concept of chemical space is now well established and many researchers involved in drug discovery projects apply these ideas [10,11]. Traditionally, the volume of chemical space is reduced by molecular descriptors, such as molecular weight and lipophilicity (log P), and undesirable chemical moieties where molecules are excluded from further consideration, shown graphically in Figure 1 [12–16]. ? 2019 by the author.",,drug development; human; procedures; quantitative structure activity relation; Drug Discovery; Humans; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship,2-s2.0-85060551837

Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the potential factor structure of the mental composite scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to evaluate the goodness of fit of the factor structure model. And logistic regression model was conducted to analyze the demographic effect. The results showed that the mental composite scale had a satisfactory reliability and validity, and the three-factor structure model had an acceptable goodness of fit. Furthermore, it indicated that annual income was the significant indicator of mental health. Participants who had earned between RMB50,000 - RMB100,000 annually were more likely to report better mental health than those with annual income less than RMB10,000. It demonstrated therefore that the mental composite scale selected from the WHOQOL-BREF was an appropriate instrument to measure the mental health of Chinese urban residents in the Yangtze River Delta region. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Demographics; Factor structure; Mental health; Urban residents; WHOQOL-BREF,,2-s2.0-85060542249

This protocol outlines an individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational cohort studies to explore the overall effect of delayed prescribing and identify key patient characteristics that are associated with efficacy of delayed prescribing. Methods and analysis A systematic search of the databases Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, EBSCO CINAHL Plus and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant studies from inception to October 2017. Outcomes of interest include duration of illness, severity of illness, complication, reconsultation and patient satisfaction. Study authors of eligible papers will be contacted and invited to contribute raw IPD data. IPD data will be checked against published data, harmonised and aggregated to create one large IPD database. Multilevel regression will be performed to explore interaction effects between treatment allocation and patient characteristics. The economic evaluation will be conducted based on IPD from the combined trial and observational studies to estimate the differences in costs and effectiveness for delayed prescribing compared with normal practice. A decision model will be developed to assess potential savings and cost-effectiveness in terms of reduced antibiotic usage of delayed prescribing and quality-adjusted life years. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained from the University of Southampton Faculty of Medicine Research Ethics Committee (Reference number: 30068). Findings of this study will be published in peer-reviewed academic journals as well as General Practice trade journals and will be presented at national and international conferences. The results will have important public health implications, shaping the way in which antibiotics are prescribed in the future and to whom delayed prescriptions are issued. ?

Pageantry and celebration were an important part of the event, and possibly a welcome distraction from the trials and horrors of war, and they were embraced by women of all social classes. But there was much more to it, as women who led the event seized the opportunity for political purposes, in what appeared to be an unthreatening environment of celebrating motherhood. Their goal was to promote the material wellbeing of, and state support for, women and children, and in this they were remarkably successful. Baby Week was also seized upon as an opportunity to showcase other welfare systems as a model for Britain, focusing in particular on New Zealand, with its free and comprehensive health service for infants. Rather than reflecting the eugenic and pronatalist concerns of the establishment, the event should be seen as a moment of politicisation of women arguing for cross-class social reform targeted at mothers. ?

Methods: Adolescents, 14-20?years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) ?95th percentile for age and sex or BMI ?40?kg·m ?2 , presenting for laparoscopic or robotic assisted or vertical sleeve gastrectomy were administered intravenous acetaminophen (1000?mg) following completion of the surgical procedure. Venous blood was drawn for acetaminophen assay at eight time points, starting 15?minutes after completion of the infusion and up to 12?hours afterward. Time-concentration data profiles were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects models. Parameter estimates were scaled to a 70-kg person using allometry. Normal fat mass was used to assess the impact of obesity on pharmacokinetic parameters. Results: The study cohort comprised 11 female patients, age 17 SD 2?years with a weight of 125 SD 19?kg and a mean BMI of 46 SD 5?kg·m ?2 . The plasma acetaminophen serum concentration was 17 (SD 4) μg·mL ?1 at 10-20?minutes after completion of the infusion and 5 (SD 6) μg·mL ?1 at 80-100?minutes.

Efforts have been undertaken to reduce mycotoxins and their toxicity, including the introduction of good agricultural practices, appropriate food processing, specific biotransformation approaches, and pursue therapeutic agents to counteract mycotoxins. Efficient and predictive tools are required for investigations on mycotoxins and their toxicodynamics, and strategies for mycotoxin reduction. Gene expression and transcriptome analysis can unravel the mode of action, transformation and combined toxicity of mycotoxins, or mycotoxin's interactions with food components including dietary therapeutics, at the cellular level and from a molecular perspective. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate endogenously and posttranscriptionally the expression of target genes and enzymes involved in physiological, disease and toxicological responses, and the metabolism of therapeutic agents. Accordingly, this review aimed to collect up-to-date information on (1) the regulatory role of miRNAs in mycotoxin-initiated toxicological processes and (2) the protective role of active ingredients from plants on mycotoxin-induced toxicity.

The cause of the accident appeared to be due to the Key-segment slipping out of the segment ring by the thrusting tailskin (wire brushes) of the TBM into the segment ring. This resulted in the collapse of the rings, causing the seabed ground and seawater to flow into the tunnel. We investigated how thin and thick segments without any circumferential joints behave under isotropic and anisotropic pressures using small-scale physical model. In the model tests, pressures were applied to the surroundings of the segment rings and the strains at each segment were measured in order to evaluate the damage. In addition, cases where lubrication on the contact area between the K-and B-segments was present or not were investigated and their discrete element simulations were also conducted. ?

Information on all homicide offenders with schizophrenia who received forensic psychiatric assessment between 2010 and 2016 in Hunan Province, China, was systematically retrieved (n = 669). Gender differences in the above characteristics were analyzed, and independent correlates of homicide were explored. The male to female ratio of homicide offenders was about 4:1. Proportionally more males were single, unemployed and younger when committing their first crime than was apparent in females. Male perpetrators were more often influenced by delusions. Females were more likely to target their close family members. For males, living in rural areas and having a family history of mental disorder were positively associated with homicide, while having a criminal history and being unemployed were negatively associated. For females, younger age was positively, while being unmarried and unemployment were negatively associated with homicide. Our results indicate significant gender differences among Chinese homicide offenders with schizophrenia in demographic, clinical and criminological characteristics and in independent correlates of homicide. Further research in this field, especially aims at determining risk factors for crime in this population, should take the gender differences into account. ? 2018",Chinese; Independent correlates; Murder; Risk factors; Severe mental disorder; Sex difference; Violence,adult; age; Article; China; clinical feature; correlation analysis; criminology; cross-sectional study; delusion; demography; disease association; family history; family violence; female; forensic psychiatry; homicide; human; major clinical study; male; offender; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; rural area; schizophrenia; sex difference; sex ratio; single (marital status); unemployment; China; family; homicide; psychology; schizophrenia; sex factor; young adult; Adult; China; Criminals; Delusions; Family; Female; Homicide; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Schizophrenia; Schizophrenic Psychology; Sex Factors; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85056888922

This study compared methods of ascribing ethnicity and socio-economic status. Children in the Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal cohort were ascribed to self-prioritised, total response and single-combined ethnic groups. Socio-economic status was measured using household income, and both census-derived and survey-derived deprivation indices. Rates of ID hospitalisation were compared using linked administrative data. Self-prioritised ethnicity was simplest to use. Total response accounted for mixed ethnicity and allowed overlap between groups. Single-combined ethnicity required aggregation of small groups to maintain power but offered greater detail. Regardless of the method used, M?ori and Pacific children, and children in the most socio-economically deprived households had a greater risk of ID hospitalisation. Risk differences between self-prioritised and total response methods were not significant for M?ori and Pacific children but single-combined ethnicity revealed a diversity of risk within these groups. Household income was affected by non-random missing data. The census-derived deprivation index offered a high level of completeness with some risk of multicollinearity and concerns regarding the ecological fallacy. The survey-derived index required extra questions but was acceptable to participants and provided individualised data. Based on these results, the use of single-combined ethnicity and an individualised survey-derived index of deprivation are recommended where sample size and data structure allow it. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press.",Ethnicity/race; infectious disease epidemiology; paediatrics; socio-economic status; statistics,Article; bacterial infection; child; child development; cohort analysis; controlled study; data analysis; ecological fallacy; economic aspect; ethnicity; female; geographic distribution; health disparity; hospitalization; household income; human; infant; infection; information processing; longitudinal study; major clinical study; mycosis; New Zealand; parasitosis; questionnaire; risk assessment; sample size; social determinants of health; social status; socioeconomics; virus infection,2-s2.0-85056672720

This study aimed to determine renal outcomes following LRV harvest during HPB resections. Methods: Circumferential PV/SMV resections from 2008 to 2014 were included within two groups (LRV harvest, Control). Absolute and change in Creatinine (Cr) and estimated GFR (eGFR), and rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: 76 patients were included (LRV n = 17, Control n = 59). Median Cr and eGFR did not change within groups, although change in eGFR differed between groups at postoperative day (POD) 3 (?4.3 vs. 12.8, p = 0.0035) and 7 (?1.8 vs. 12.4, p = 0.0074). AKI occurred more frequently in the LRV group at POD1 (5/17 vs. 4/59, p = 0.023) and POD3 (5/17 vs. 3/59, p = 0012), with no difference in CKD between groups (2/11 vs. 5/33 at 3 months, p = 0.99). LRV harvest was an independent risk factor for AKI at POD1 and POD3, but not thereafter. Conclusions: Patients who undergo LRV harvest experience a higher rate of AKI in the first three post-operative days.

We compare the performance of dialysis centres in Australia and New Zealand in their treatment of haemodialysis patients, accounting for the competing risks of kidney transplantation and transfer to peritoneal dialysis. Methods: Observational cohort study. We included data from all adult patients (5574 patients) commencing haemodialysis at home or in a facility between 2008 and 2010 across 62 dialysis centres, from the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant Registry. Standardised mortality ratios were calculated by estimating mortality probabilities from a pooled random effects logistic regression model, accounting for the competing risk of transplantation using an inverse probability weighting approach. Models were adjusted for patient comorbidities, sex, height, weight, late referral to a nephrologist, age, race, primary kidney disease, smoking status, and serum creatinine (μmol/l). Results: Two dialysis centres were found to have relatively higher levels of risk-adjusted mortality lying outside the prediction intervals for ""usual"" performance. Risk adjusted mortality rates were not associated with centres' compliance with guidelines for vascular access and biochemical and haematological targets. Conclusions: We demonstrate that standardised mortality ratios are useful to identify facilities that have statistically outlying mortality risk. Our criterion for determining whether a centre has better or worse performance than expected is statistical, and thus analyses such as ours can serve only as a screening tool, and are only one aspect of assessment of ""quality"" of performance. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Center performance; Mortality; Standardized mortality ratio; Transplantation,adult; aged; Australia; cohort analysis; comorbidity; epidemiology; female; health care facility; human; kidney transplantation; male; middle aged; mortality; New Zealand; peritoneal dialysis; register; rehabilitation; standards; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; survival analysis; Adult; Aged; Australia; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Female; Health Facilities; Humans; Kidney Transplantation; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Peritoneal Dialysis; Registries; Survival Analysis,2-s2.0-85059253434

Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) accounts for approximately 25% of NMSC. A better understanding of predictors of close and positive margins following surgical excision will help guide treatment. METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out of all primary cSCC histologically diagnosed in Northland, New Zealand in 2015. The cohort was identified by searching the regional pathology database. The primary outcome of interest was positive and close (?1mm) margin rate following surgical excision and factors influencing them. Secondary outcomes of interest were outcomes of re-excisions. RESULTS: A total of 1,040 cSCC were identified in 890 unique patients and 825 lesions were surgically excised. Increased odds of positive margin on surgical excision was found with increased tumour thickness (OR 1.56, 95% CI 1.24–1.96), tumours from the head and neck (OR 2.78, 95% CI 1.33–5.80) and those excised in primary care (OR 2.20, 95% CI 1.07–4.52). Increased odds of close margins was found in females (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.3–3.2) and excision in primary care (OR 2.44 95% CI 1.5–3.98). Residual tumour was present in 13 (31.7%) patients with positive margins and 0 patients with close margins. CONCLUSIONS: Lesions of the head and neck, those removed in primary care and with increased tumour thickness were more likely to have positive margins following surgical excision. Close margins were associated with excision in primary care and female gender. The value of re-excising tumours with close margins remains uncertain. ?

While undertaking a qualitative study in a rural community in Northland, New Zealand about the complexities of living with diabetes, we observed a common emotional discourse about the burden of diabetic pregnancies. Given the significance of GDM and our commitment to give voice to Indigenous M?ori women in ways that could potentially inform solutions, we aimed to explore the phenomenon of GDM among M?ori women in a rural context marked by high area-deprivation. Method: A qualitative and Kaupapa M?ori methodology was utilised. A sub-sample of women (n = 10) from a broader study designed to improve type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who had experienced GDM or pre-existing diabetes during pregnancy and/or had been exposed to diabetes in utero were interviewed. Participants in the broader study were recruited via the local primary care clinic. Experiences of GDM, in relation to their current T2DM, was sought. Narrative data was analysed for themes. Results: Intergenerational experiences informed perceptions that GDM was an inevitable heritable illness that ""just runs in the family."" The cumulative effects of deprivation and living with GDM compounded the complexities of participant' lives including perceptions of powerlessness and mental health deterioration. Missed opportunities for health services to detect and manage diabetes had ongoing health consequences for the women and their offspring. Positive relationships with healthcare providers facilitated management of GDM and helped women engage with self-management. Conclusion: M?ori women living with T2DM were clear that health providers had failed to intervene in ways that would have potentially slowed or prevented progression of GDM to T2DM. Participants revealed missed opportunities for appropriate diagnostic testing, treatment and health promotion programmes for GDM. Poor collaboration between health services and social services meant psychosocial issues were rarely addressed and the cycle of intergenerational poverty and disadvantage prevailed. These data highlight opportunities for extended case management to include wh?nau (family) engagement, input from social services, and evidence-based medicine and/or long-term management and prevention of T2DM. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Decolonising; Gestational diabetes; Indigenous; Kaupapa Maori; Mana Tu; Maori; Type 2 diabetes,"insulin; adult; aged; Article; attitude to illness; case management; clinical article; cooperation; diagnostic test; doctor patient relation; evidence based medicine; family counseling; family history; female; health care delivery; health care personnel; health program; health promotion; heritability; human; indigenous people; interview; Maori (people); maternal attitude; maternal care; mental deterioration; middle aged; narrative; New Zealand; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; poverty; powerlessness; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; primary medical care; public health service; qualitative research; rural area; self care; social psychology; social status; social work; thematic analysis; colonialism; health care delivery; health service; New Zealand; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Oceanic ancestry group; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; rural population; transcultural care; Adult; Aged; Case Management; Colonialism; Culturally Competent Care; Delivery of Health Care; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Health Promotion; Health Services; Humans; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Poverty; Pregnancy; Pregnancy in Diabetics; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Social Work",2-s2.0-85058524931

Aim: To review the literature surrounding the helicopter transport of injured divers and establish if vibration contributes to increased VGE. Method: A systematic literature search of key databases was conducted to identify articles investigating vibration and bubbles during helicopter retrieval of divers. Level of evidence was graded using the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine guidelines. A modified quality assessment tool for studies with diverse designs (QATSDD) was used to assess the overall quality of evidence. Results: Seven studies were included in the review. An in vitro research paper provided some evidence of bubble formation with gas supersaturation and vibration. Only one prospective intervention study was identified which examined the effect of vibration on VGE formation. Bubble duration was used to quantify VGE load with no difference found between the vibration and non-vibration time periods. This study was published in 1980 and technological advances since that time suggest cautious interpretation of the results. The remaining studies were retrospective chart reviews of helicopter retrieval of divers. Mode of transport, altitude exposure, oxygen and intravenous fluids use were examined. Conclusion: There is some physical evidence that vibration leads to bubble formation although there is a paucity of research on the specific effects of helicopter vibration and VGE in divers. Technological advances have led to improved assessment of VGE in divers and will aid in further research. ?

The effect of different O 2 mask configurations on tissue oxygenation when breathing with a demand valve was evaluated. Methods: Sixteen divers had tissue oxygen partial pressure (P tc O 2 ) measured at six limb sites. Participants breathed O2 from a demand valve using: an intraoral mask (IOM?) with and without a nose clip (NC), a pocket face mask and an oronasal mask. In-line inspired O 2 (FIO 2 ) and nasopharyngeal FIO 2 were measured. Participants provided subjective ratings of mask comfort, ease of breathing and holding in position. Results: P tc O 2 values and nasopharyngeal FIO 2 (median &amp; range) were greatest using the IOM? with NC and similar with the IOM? without NC. O 2 measurements were lowest with the oronasal mask which also was rated as the most difficult to breathe from and to hold in position. The pocket face mask was reported as the most comfortable to wear. The NC was widely described as uncomfortable. The IOM? and pocket face mask were rated best for ease of breathing. The IOM? was rated as the easiest to hold in position. Conclusion: Of the commonly available O 2 masks for use with a demand valve, the IOM? with NC achieved the highest P tc O 2 values.

Detection of bilateral lymphedema, common after bilateral breast or gynecological cancer, is complicated by the unavailability of an unaffected contralateral limb. The objectives of this work were to (1) present normative values for interarm, interleg, and arm-to-leg impedance ratios of ECF and ECF normalized to intracellular fluid (ECF/ICF); (2) evaluate the influence of sex, age, and body mass index on ratios; and (3) describe the normal change in ratios within healthy individuals over time. Methods: Data from five studies were combined to generate a normative data set (n = 808) from which mean and SD were calculated for interarm, interleg, and arm-to-leg ratios of ECF and ECF/ICF. The influence of sex, age, and body mass index was evaluated using multiple linear regression, and normative change was calculated for participants with repeated measures by subtracting their lowest ratio from their highest ratio. Results: Mean (SD) interarm, interleg, dominant arm-to-leg, and nondominant arm-to-leg ratios were 0.987 (0.067), 1.005 (0.072), 1.129 (0.160), and 1.165 (0.174) for ECF ratios; and 0.957 (0.188), 1.024 (0.183), 1.194 (0.453), and 1.117 (0.367) for ECF/ICF ratios, respectively. Arm-to-leg ratios were significantly affected by sex, age, and body mass index. Mean normative change ranged from 7.2% to 14.7% for ECF ratios and from 14.7% to 67.1% for ECF/ICF ratios. Conclusion: These findings provide the necessary platform for extending bioimpedance-based screening beyond unilateral lymphedema. ? 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",bilateral; bioimpedance; diagnostic criteria; lower limb; Lymphedema,adult; age distribution; aged; aging; Article; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; early diagnosis; female; human; intracellular fluid; lower limb lymphedema; lymphedema; major clinical study; male; obesity; outcome assessment; priority journal; sex difference; sex ratio; upper limb lymphedema,2-s2.0-85058783653

However, recent literature has included the skill of the health professional and the accessibility of health resources as important factors in the level of health literacy achieved by individuals and populations. In 2014 a qualitative study undertaken in Aotearoa New Zealand, investigated the context of health literacy for M?ori in a palliative care setting (M?ori are the indigenous people of Aotearoa New Zealand). The study included the experiences of patients, wh?nau (families), and health professionals. Method: Individual semi-structured interviews were held with 21 patients, wh?nau and six key informants: a medical specialist, a service leader involved in developing culturally specific responses to patients, two M?ori service managers, and two M?ori health team leaders. Focus groups were held with a total of 54 health professionals providing palliative care services. Data analysis: A thematic analysis was undertaken using a general inductive approach. The trustworthiness and reliability of the analysis was supported by sharing analysis of the transcripts among the research team. Member checking or respondent validation was used in seeking confirmation of the interim findings at five hui (meetings) with the research communities involved. Findings: This study found that the shock and grief that attends a life-limiting illness made hearing and processing health information very difficult for patients and wh?nau. Further, ‘hard conversations’ about moving from active treatment to palliative care were often avoided by health professionals, leaving patients and wh?nau distressed and confused about their choices and prognosis. Finally, poor cultural health literacy on the part of organisations has likely impacted on late access to or avoidance of palliative care for M?ori. ?

However, screening rates in some groups are low. Use of a point-of-care device may improve compliance with screening. Aim: To assess the accuracy of the COBAS b101 point-of-care system referenced against a laboratory method, for measurement of HbA1c levels in pregnant women. Materials and methods: Convenience sample of 40 obese pregnant women enrolled in a clinical trial. HbA1c was assayed in paired capillary and venous whole blood samples using the COBAS b101 point-of-care system and Primus Ultra2 high performance liquid chromatography laboratory analyser, respectively. The accuracy of the point-of-care system was assessed by Bland–Altman analysis. Results: The mean (SD) laboratory HbA1c was 35.9 (2.0)?mmol/mol. The COBAS b101 point-of-care system, compared with the laboratory reference method, had a small negative bias for HbA1c (?1.0?mmol/mol, 95% CI ?2.0 to ?0.03, P?=?0.03) and relatively wide 95% limits of agreement (?7.2 to 5.1?mmol/mol). Conclusion: In conclusion, we found that in pregnancy, the COBAS b101 point-of-care system has a small negative bias and modest point accuracy for HbA1c. When used to screen for previously unrecognised diabetes in pregnancy, appropriate COBAS b101 HbA1c point-of-care HbA1c thresholds for a negative and positive result are 7?mmol/mol below and 5?mmol/mol above the clinical threshold, respectively.

To understand the reasons underlying these failures and to develop novel strategies that target lifestyle energy expenditure in both prevention and treatment of obesity, research over the past decades has focused on (i) the interactions between physical activity and body weight (and its composition) throughout the lifespan; (ii) the influence of biology and potential compensatory changes in energy expenditure, food intake and food assimilation in response to energy deficits; and (iii) the impact of the built environment (outdoor and indoor) and smart technology on physical activity behaviours, thermoregulatory thermogenesis and metabolic health.

Methods: Qualitative, in-depth, semi-structured interviews with New Zealand practising community pharmacists are identified through purposive and convenience sampling. Data were analysed using a general inductive approach. Key findings: Participants held mixed views regarding harmonisation of CMs regulations across Australia and NZ; some supported an NZ national regulatory framework for CMs, based on the Australian system. Participants recognised the current CMs regulatory framework in NZ as inadequate, that regulation was required to some extent, and that mandatory regulation was not necessarily required. A key reason given in support of CMs regulations was the need for greater assurances around quality of CMs. Participants also supported a regulatory framework that incorporated assessment of the safety of CMs, but were less convinced of the need for, or feasibility of, requiring evidence of efficacy from clinical trials. Participants believed that regulation of CMs practitioners, such as herbalists, and CMs retailers was important, although there were mixed views as to whether regulation should be statutory or whether self-regulation would be adequate. Conclusions: On the basis of these findings, pharmacists would be expected to welcome proposals for national regulations for CMs in NZ: such regulations should address concerns regarding product quality, inappropriate health claims and supporting evidence, and therefore should support pharmacists in meeting their obligations under the NZ Pharmacy Council's Code of Ethics. ? 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society",community pharmacists; complementary medicines; interviews; legislation; natural health products,adult; alternative medicine; article; Australia; autoregulation; clinical trial (topic); community pharmacist; convenience sample; drug efficacy; drug safety; ethics; feasibility study; female; human; human experiment; law; male; New Zealand; physician; qualitative research; semi structured interview; traditional healer; aged; alternative medicine; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; interview; legislation and jurisprudence; middle aged; New Zealand; organization and management; pharmacist; pharmacy (shop); professional standard; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Australia; Community Pharmacy Services; Complementary Therapies; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Pharmacists; Professional Role; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85057184793

Conventional clinical methods for assessing these waveforms are often overlooked because they require specialised expertise, and are invasive and expensive to implement. Recently, image-based methods have been used to quantify JV pulsation waveforms on the skin as an indirect way of estimating the pressure waveforms. However, these existing image-based methods cannot explicitly measure skin deformations and rely on the use of photoplethysmography (PPG) devices for identification of the pulsatile waveforms. As a result, they often have limited accuracy and robustness and are unsuitable in the clinical environment. Here, we propose a technique to directly measure skin deformations caused by the JV pulse using a very accurate subpixel registration algorithm. The method simply requires images obtained from the subject’s neck using a commodity camera. The results show that our measured waveforms contained all of the essential features of diagnostic JV waveforms in all of 19 healthy subjects tested in this study, indicating a significantly important capability for a potential future diagnostic device. The shape of our measured JV displacement waveforms was validated using waveforms measured with a laser displacement sensor, where the average correlation score between the two waveforms was 0.93 ± 0.05. In addition, synchronously recorded ECG signals were used to verify the timings of diagnostic features of the measured waveforms. To our knowledge, this is the first use of image registration for direct measurement of JV displacement waveforms. Significant advantages of our novel method include the high precision of our measurements, and the ability to use ordinary cameras, such as those in modern mobile phones. These advantages will enable the development of affordable and accessible devices to measure JV waveforms for cardiac diagnostics in the clinical environment. Future devices based on this technology may provide viable options for telemedicine applications, point of care diagnostics, and mobile-based cardiac health monitoring systems. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"adult; algorithm; cardiovascular disease; electrocardiography; female; heart; heart rate; human; male; middle aged; normal human; pathophysiology; photoelectric plethysmography; physiology; procedures; signal processing; skin; telemedicine; vascularization; young adult; Adult; Algorithms; Cardiovascular Diseases; Electrocardiography; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Heart; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Photoplethysmography; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Skin; Telemedicine; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85057087871

In this study, we investigate symptom clusters in women prospectively diagnosed with severe premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or PMDD using factor analysis; analyze the stability of the structures of different symptom patterns and their association with impairment at work, in recreation, and in relationships. A total of 174 prospective symptom diaries were analyzed with principal axis factoring revealing six clusters named affective dysphoria, somatic dysphoria, irritability, breast/body sensitivity, pain, and eating behavior. Cronbach's alpha was good for all clusters (0.83 to 0.91) with the exception of the cluster pain (0.69). Clusters of symptoms appeared to be stable between two consecutive menstrual cycles (except of pain and eating behavior) and between two cycles with a waiting period of eight weeks in between. Multiple regression analyses showed different associations of the clusters with impairment. Somatic dysphoria was the cluster most strongly associated with impairment. The results indicate that in severe PMS/PMDD, different symptom patterns should be considered. As the risk of impairment differs between symptom clusters, individual treatment options should be considered and further investigated in research and treatment. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Premenstrual changes; Premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD); Premenstrual syndrome (PMS); Prospective assessments; Symptom diary,adult; Article; breast disease; dysphoria; feeding behavior; female; human; irritability; major clinical study; menstrual cycle; pain; premenstrual dysphoric disorder; premenstrual syndrome; premenstrual dysphoric disorder; premenstrual syndrome; prospective study; psychology; Adult; Female; Humans; Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder; Premenstrual Syndrome; Prospective Studies,2-s2.0-85055094382

Local evidence of each indicator was compiled from government institutions and verified by related government stakeholders. The extent of implementation of the policies was rated by experts against international best practices. Rating results were used to identify and propose policy actions which were subsequently prioritised by the experts based on 'importance' and 'achievability' criteria. The policy actions with relatively higher 'achievability' and 'importance' were set as priority recommendations for government action.Setting Malaysia.Subjects Twenty-six local experts.Results Majority (62 %) of indicators was rated 'low' implementation with no indicator rated as either 'high' or 'very little, if any' in terms of implementation. The top five recommendations were (i) restrict unhealthy food marketing in children's settings and (ii) on broadcast media; (iii) mandatory nutrition labelling for added sugars; (iv) designation of priority research areas related to obesity prevention and diet-related non-communicable diseases; and (v) introduce energy labelling on menu boards for fast-food outlets.Conclusions This first policy study conducted in Malaysia identified a number of gaps in implementation of key policies to promote healthy food environments, compared with international best practices. Study findings could strengthen civil society advocacies for government accountability to create a healthier food environment. ?

This study aims to examine trends in the uptake of EGFR mutation testing in patients with non-squamous NSCLC in New Zealand; to develop a composite metric that quantifies the influences of demographic and clinico-pathological factors on the testing uptake; and to estimate the prevalence of EGFR mutation if all patients were tested. Methods: This population-based study involved all patients who were diagnosed with non-squamous NSCLC in four health regions in New Zealand between January 2010 and December 2015. Eligible patients were identified from the New Zealand Cancer Registry and information on EGFR mutation testing was obtained through linkage to TestSafe, a clinical information sharing service, and laboratory records. Results: Of 2701 eligible patients, 1059 (39.2%) were tested for EGFR mutation. The testing prevalence increased (3.7% in 2010 to 64.6% in 2014) and the influences of demographic and clinic-pathological factors decreased from 2010 to June 2014, and remained stable afterward. Of the tested patients, 229 (21.6%) were mutation positive with a decreasing trend observed from 2010 (43.8%) to June 2014 (16.8%). The best-fit log-linear model estimated the prevalence of EGFR mutation, if all patients were tested, as 15.5% (95% CI: 13.2%–18.0%). Conclusion: The methods described here allowed a more accurate estimation of the prevalence of EGFR mutation. ? 2018 The Authors",Composite metric; Epidermal growth factor receptor; Genetic testing; Mutation; Non-small cell lung carcinoma,"epidermal growth factor receptor; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; adult; aged; Article; female; gene mutation; genetic screening; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; mutation rate; New Zealand; non small cell lung cancer; population research; prevalence; priority journal; very elderly; genetics; lung tumor; middle aged; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; register; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; ErbB Receptors; Female; Genetic Testing; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; New Zealand; Prevalence; Registries",2-s2.0-85054050991

Most studies focus on identifying somatic mutations in the protein coding portion of the genome using whole exome sequencing (WES). Every human genome has around 4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A sizeable fraction of these germline SNPs is very rare and will not be found in the databases. Thus, in order to unambiguously identify somatic mutation, it is absolutely necessary to know the germline SNPs of the patient. While a blood sample can serve as source of germline DNA from patients with solid tumours, obtaining germline DNA from patients with haematological malignancies is very difficult. Tumor cells often infiltrate the skin, and their DNA can be found in saliva and buccal swab samples. The DNA in the tips of nails stems from keratinocytes that have undergone keratinization several months ago. DNA was successfully extracted from nail clippings of 5 probands for WES. We were able to identify somatic mutations in one tumor exome by using the nail exome as germline reference. Our results demonstrate that nail DNA is a reliable source of germline DNA in the setting of hematological malignancies. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"DNA; acute myeloid leukemia; adult stem cell; blood; chemistry; exome; genetic database; genetics; high throughput sequencing; human; human genome; metabolism; mouth mucosa; mutation; nail; pathology; saliva; single nucleotide polymorphism; whole exome sequencing; Adult Germline Stem Cells; Databases, Genetic; DNA, Neoplasm; Exome; Genome, Human; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Mouth Mucosa; Mutation; Nails; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Saliva; Whole Exome Sequencing",2-s2.0-85053293248

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. A final sample of 228 evaluable patients was included in the analyses. Sociodemographic and clinical data were also collected. Two EQ-5D questionnaires were scored using Spanish tariffs. Two models and three statistical techniques were used to estimate each model in the direct mapping framework for all three MAU instruments, including the most widely used ordinary least squares (OLS), the robust MM-estimator, and the generalized linear model (GLM). For both EQ-5D-3L and EQ-5D-5L, indirect response mapping based on an ordered logit model was also conducted. Three goodness-of-fit tests were employed to compare the models: the mean absolute error (MAE), the root-mean-square error (RMSE), and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) between the predicted and observed utilities. Results: Health state utility scores ranged from 0.61 (EQ-5D-3L) to 0.74 (15D). The mean PDQ-8 score was 27.51. The correlation between overall PDQ-8 score and each MAU instrument ranged from ? 0.729 (EQ-5D-5L) to ? 0.752 (EQ-5D-3L). A mapping algorithm based on PDQ-8 items had better performance than using the overall score. For the two EQ-5D questionnaires, in general, the indirect mapping approach had comparable or even better performance than direct mapping based on MAE. Conclusions: Mapping algorithms developed in this study enable the estimation of utility values from the PDQ-8. The indirect mapping equations reported for two EQ-5D questionnaires will further facilitate the calculation of EQ-5D utility scores using other country-specific tariffs. ? 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",,"aged; algorithm; Article; correlation coefficient; cost effectiveness analysis; cost utility analysis; cross-sectional study; EQ 5D 15D Questionnaire; EQ 5D 3L Questionnaire; EQ 5D 5L Questionnaire; female; generalized linear model; health status; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; measurement error; measurement precision; neurologic disease assessment; ordinary least squares analysis; Parkinson disease; Parkinson Disease Questionnaire 8; priority journal; quality of life; quality of life assessment; regression analysis; robust mm estimator; statistical analysis; validation process; adult; cost benefit analysis; health status indicator; middle aged; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; procedures; questionnaire; standards; statistical model; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85048032363

This research evaluated the effectiveness of a web-based mental health promotion intervention on stigma and discrimination in community pharmacies via assessment of staff attitudes, confidence and skills. Methods: Guided by the intervention mapping framework, we used experiential learning techniques, including pre-recorded consumer/carer narratives, role-plays and panel discussions accessed by participants in an innovative, flexible, web-based, program of modules. A quasi-experimental pre-post design was used to evaluate the intervention effectiveness. Participants completed pre- (T1) and post-intervention (T2) questionnaires that contained both validated measures and questions developed or adapted specifically for this evaluation. Results: 566 pharmacy staff (357 pharmacists, 209 support staff) completed the intervention between September 2012 and May 2013; pharmacists completed eight online modules (4-hours total), support staff completed four (2-hours total). After participating, staff attitudes about mental health had changed in a positive direction; their confidence and skills when working with consumers and their carers had increased overall, although support staff remained less confident than pharmacists. Conclusion: These results suggest that the involvement of consumers and carers in the intervention development and delivery was integral to reducing pharmacy staff stigma and enhancing confidence and communication skills. ? 2018 Australian Health Promotion Association",attitudes; community pharmacy; confidence; discrimination; internet; mental health promotion; skills; stigma,adult; article; communication skill; comparative effectiveness; consumer; experiential learning; female; human; human experiment; Internet; male; mental health; narrative; pharmacist; pharmacy; questionnaire; role playing; staff; stigma; aged; Australia; comparative study; health personnel attitude; health promotion; Internet; mental disease; mental health; middle aged; pharmacy (shop); prejudice; procedures; psychology; social stigma; statistical model; verbal communication; young adult; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Australia; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Internet; Linear Models; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Narration; Pharmacies; Pharmacists; Prejudice; Social Stigma; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85043332783

Objective: To explore the reasons for poor compliance with maternity guidelines by evaluating the quality of a sample of National Women's Health guidelines using a validated instrument and assessing local guideline users’ perceptions of and attitudes toward guidelines. Design: Five independent reviewers evaluated the quality of 10 purposively selected guidelines for adherence to the Appraisal of Guidelines Research & Evaluation (AGREE) II instrument standards. A self-administered questionnaire for staff was undertaken regarding views of and barriers to guideline use. Results: None of the guidelines attained a score over 50% for the following domains: stakeholder involvement, rigour of development, applicability, editorial independence. The highest scoring domain was clarity of presentation (mean 69%). All guidelines scored the minimum possible for editorial independence. Survey respondents had positive attitudes toward guidelines, believed that their use could improve quality of care within the service, and felt that encouragement from senior staff members and peers would encourage their use. Accessibility was the most commonly cited of many barriers identified. Conclusion: The National Women's Health guidelines evaluated in this study cannot be considered to be high quality, and could be improved by reporting on methodology of the development process.

Studies have identified individual characteristics and sociodemographic variables of those who complete the surgery compared to those who do not. The aim of the present protocol is to outline a systematic review focussed on identifying the sociodemographic, medical, cultural, psychological, and patient-led factors affecting preoperative attrition in clients who were enrolled in bariatric surgery programmes. Methods/design: The databases Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and MEDLINE will be searched for retrospective, prospective, and cross-sectional observational studies that have identified any sociodemographic, medical, cultural, psychological, and patient-led factors affecting preoperative attrition in clients who are enrolled in a bariatric surgery programme.

However, cancer cells in the same microenvironment appear not to be affected. Mechanisms whereby cancer cells resist accelerated tryptophan degradation are not completely understood. We hypothesize that cancer cells co-opt IMPACT (the product of IMPrinted and AnCienT gene), to withstand periods of tryptophan deficiency. Methods: A range of bioinformatic techniques including correlation and gene set variation analyses was applied to genomic datasets of cancer (The Cancer Genome Atlas) and normal (Genotype Tissue Expression Project) tissues to investigate IMPACT's role in cancer. Survival of IMPACT-overexpressing GL261 glioma cells and their wild type counterparts cultured in low tryptophan media was assessed using fluorescence microscopy and MTT bio-reduction assay. Expression of the Integrated Stress Response proteins was measured using Western blotting. Results: We found IMPACT to be upregulated and frequently amplified in a broad range of clinical cancers relative to their non-malignant tissue counterparts. In a subset of clinical cancers, high IMPACT expression associated with decreased activity of pathways and genes involved in stress response and with increased activity of translational regulation such as the mTOR pathway. Experimental studies using the GL261 glioma line showed that cells engineered to overexpress IMPACT, gained a survival advantage over wild-type lines when cultured under limiting tryptophan concentrations. No significant difference in the expression of proteins in the Integrated Stress Response pathway was detected in tryptophan-deprived GL261 IMPACT-overexpressors compared to that in wild-type cells. IMPACT-overexpressing GL261 cells but not their wild-type counterparts, showed marked enlargement of their nuclei and cytoplasmic area when stressed by tryptophan deprivation. Conclusions: The bioinformatics data together with our laboratory studies, support the hypothesis that IMPACT mediates a protective mechanism allowing cancer cells to overcome microenvironmental stresses such as tryptophan deficiency. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Cancer cell survival; IDO1; Immune suppression; IMPACT,"mammalian target of rapamycin; tryptophan; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; tryptophan; amino acid deficiency; Article; cancer cell; cell nucleus; cell survival; controlled study; cytoplasm; gene; gene amplification; gene control; gene expression; glioma cell; IMPACT gene; priority journal; protein expression; stress; translation regulation; animal; biology; cell survival; DNA methylation; gene dosage; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; mouse; physiological stress; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Computational Biology; DNA Methylation; Gene Dosage; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Mice; Stress, Physiological; Tryptophan",2-s2.0-85057121292

Integrated care approaches that aim to coordinate primary care with community care known as community based primary health care (CBPHC) has been a key policy initiative across health systems; however most attention has been paid to the needs of patients and not caregivers. The objective of this paper was to explore the unmet needs of caregivers of older adults with complex care needs receiving CBPHC. Methods: This qualitative descriptive study entailed one-to-one interviews with 80 caregivers from Canada and New Zealand where roles, experiences and needs were explored. Interview text related to unmet need was reviewed inductively and core themes identified. Results: Three themes were identified across CBPHC sites: unrecognized role; lack of personal resources; and no breaks even when services are in place. Conclusions: To support caregivers, models of care such as CBPHC need to look beyond the patient to meaningfully engage caregivers, address their needs and recognize the insight they hold. This knowledge needs to be valued as a key source of evidence to inform developments in health and social care. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Canada; Caregivers; New Zealand; Primary care; Qualitative,aged; article; Canada; caregiver; human; interview; New Zealand; primary health care; qualitative research; social care; adult; community care; female; male; middle aged; needs assessment; occupational health; organization and management; primary health care; psychology; qualitative research; self care; social support; Adult; Aged; Caregivers; Community Health Services; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Occupational Health; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Self Care; Social Support,2-s2.0-85056353117

TherapeuticsMD has developed Imvexxy, small softgel capsules that contain solubilized estradiol and that are inserted vaginally by women twice a week, every 3 to 4 days. These vaginal inserts have been found to readily supply estradiol to the vagina and to result in significant improvement in the GSM signs and symptoms these women had been experiencing. At the same time, pharmacokinetic studies have demonstrated that the small doses of estradiol used do not increase systemic blood levels of estrogens above baseline values, thus greatly reducing the likelihood of unwanted systemic effects of estradiol. The placebo used in clinical trials, which only contained the 'inactive' ingredients in Imvexxy, had partial efficacy, the result either of a placebo effect or of the use of MIGLYOL 812 N to keep the estradiol in solution. ? 2018 Clarivate Analytics.",Estradiol; Imvexxy; Menopause; Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause; Vaginal inserts,"estradiol; estrogen; estradiol; estrogen; adverse event; area under the curve; Article; breast cancer; cardiovascular disease; clinical study; dementia; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug structure; endometrium cancer; human; maximum concentration; menopausal syndrome; time to maximum plasma concentration; urogenital tract disease; vagina atrophy; atrophy; blood; chemistry; drug effect; drug formulation; female; gel; hormone substitution; intravaginal drug administration; menopause; metabolism; microcapsule; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; syndrome; treatment outcome; urogenital tract disease; vagina; Administration, Intravaginal; Atrophy; Capsules; Drug Compounding; Estradiol; Estrogens; Female; Female Urogenital Diseases; Gels; Hormone Replacement Therapy; Humans; Menopause; Syndrome; Treatment Outcome; Vagina",2-s2.0-85058609301

While osteolytic defects are commonly observed in long-term follow-up, how such lesions alter the distribution of stress is unclear. The aim of this study was to quantitatively describe the biomechanical implication of such lesions by performing subject-specific finite-element (FE) analysis on patients with osteolysis after THA. Patients and Methods: A total of 22 hemipelvis FE models were constructed in order to assess the transfer of load in 11 patients with osteolysis around the acetabular component of a THA during slow walking and a fall onto the side. There were nine men and two women. Their mean age was 69 years (55 to 81) at final follow-up. Changes in peak stress values and loads to fracture in the presence of the osteolytic defects were measured. Results: The von Mises stresses were increased in models of those with and those without defects for both loading scenarios. Although some regions showed increases in stress values of up to 100%, there was only a moderate 11.2% increase in von Mises stress in the series as a whole. The site of fracture changed in some models with lowering of the load to fracture by 500 N. The most common site of fracture was the pubic ramus. This was more frequent in models with larger defects. Conclusion: We conclude that cancellous defects cause increases in stress within cortical structures. However, these are likely to lead to a modest decrease in the load to fracture if the defect is large (&gt; 20cm3) or if the patient is small with thin cortical structures and low bone mineral density. ?2018 The British Editorial Society of Bone & Joint Surgery",,acetabulum fracture; adult; aged; Article; biomechanics; body weight; bone atrophy; bone stress; clinical article; cortical bone; disease severity; falling; female; finite element analysis; follow up; hip; human; ischium; male; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; osteolysis; patient assessment; patient care; pelvis; prediction; priority journal; pubic bone; pubis symphysis; risk assessment; sacroiliac joint; surgical margin; treatment failure; von mises stress; walking; x-ray computed tomography; Young modulus,2-s2.0-85056348780

This paper examines the spatial achievement of safety and wellbeing by healthcare staff, patients and their carers within UK primary care and Australian palliative care contexts. Two key socio-spatial modes of safety and wellbeing were found across these healthcare contexts. The technical mode was spatially managed by staff and driven by formal approaches to safety with a limited focus on wellbeing. In contrast, the relational mode was driven by attentiveness to the wellbeing and spatial engagement of staff, patients and carers that drew on informal elements of safety. Both modes extended across public, private, biomedical and administrative spaces, with technical and relational safety-wellbeing configurations often inhabiting the same spaces. Differences also existed across primary and palliative care contexts that reflected the unique pressures present within each context, and the ability of people and places to adapt to these demands. In the context of increasing workloads in healthcare internationally, this study highlights the benefits of attending as much to the relational dimensions of safety and quality of care as to the technical ones through increased focus on the safety and wellbeing of healthcare staff, patients and carers within and beyond traditional sites of care. ? 2018 The Authors",Palliative care; Patient safety; Primary care; Space; Wellbeing,"disease treatment; health worker; primary health care; safety; space use; spatial analysis; achievement; adult; article; attention; drug safety; human; palliative therapy; patient safety; primary medical care; staff; wellbeing; workload; Australia; cultural anthropology; female; health care personnel; health care quality; male; palliative therapy; patient care; primary health care; procedures; psychology; United Kingdom; Australia; United Kingdom; Anthropology, Cultural; Australia; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Palliative Care; Patient Safety; Patient-Centered Care; Primary Health Care; Quality of Health Care; United Kingdom",2-s2.0-85056223560

SUMMARY ANSWER JAK1 is a key factor involved in the regulation of primordial follicle activation and maintenance of the ovarian reserve. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY A series of integrated, intrinsic signalling pathways (including PI3K/AKT, mTOR and KITL) are responsible for regulating the ovarian reserve of non-growing primordial follicles and ultimately female fertility. The JAK-STAT signal transduction pathway is highly conserved with established roles in cell division and differentiation. Key pathway members (specifically JAK1, STAT3 and SOCS4) have been previously implicated in early follicle development. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION A laboratory animal study was undertaken using the C57Bl/6 inbred mouse strain as a model for human ovarian follicle development. To determine which Jak genes were most abundantly expressed during primordial follicle activation, mRNA expression was analysed across a developmental time-course, with ovaries collected from female mice at post-natal days 1 (PND1), 4 (PND4), 8 (PND8), as well as at 6 weeks (6WK) and 7 months (7MTH) (n ? 4). Functional analysis of JAK1 was performed on PND2 mouse ovaries subjected to in vitro explant culture treated with 12.5 μM Ruxolitinib (JAK inhibitor) or vehicle control (DMSO) for 48 h prior to histological assessment (n ? 4). PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS The expression and localization of the JAK family during ovarian follicle development in the C57Bl/6 inbred mouse strain were evaluated using quantitative PCR, immunoblotting and immunolocalisation. Functional studies were undertaken using the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib to investigate the underpinning cellular mechanisms via biochemical in vitro inhibition and histological assessment of intact neonate ovaries. All experiments were replicated at least three times using tissue from different mice unless otherwise stated. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Jak1 is the predominant Jak mRNA expressed in the C57Bl/6 mouse ovary across all developmental time-points assessed (P ? 0.05). Forty-eight hour inhibition of JAK1 with Ruxolitinib of PND2 ovaries in vitro demonstrated concomitant acceleration of primordial follicle activation and apoptosis (P ? 0.001) and upregulation of downstream JAK-STAT pathway members STAT3 and suppressors of cytokine signalling 4 (SOCS4). LARGE-SCALE DATA N/A. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION Results are shown in one species, the C57Bl/6 mouse strain as an established model of human ovary development. Ruxolitinib also inhibits JAK2, with decreased efficacy. However, Jak2 mRNA had limited expression in the mouse ovary, particularly at the neonatal stages of follicle development, thus any effect of Ruxolitinib on primordial follicle activation was unlikely to be mediated via this isoform. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS This study supports a key role for JAK1 in the maintenance and activation of primordial follicles, with potential for targeting the JAK-STAT pathway as a method of regulating the ovarian reserve and female fertility.

There are a range of explanations within the literature as to why youth abscond from care, which can be grouped into individual, relational and contextual factors. This research explored the risk and protective factors for absconding behavior through two studies. The quantitative study examined the risk factors for absconding through a retrospective file audit of New Zealand young people who had resided in out-of-home care (N = 241). Regression analyses revealed that there was a significant relationship between absconding and gender (females are at higher risk), a higher number of admissions to care, and suicidal ideation. The qualitative study involved interviewing 40 young people from out-of-home care, including both absconders and non-absconders. Results indicated that absconding was motivated primarily by relationships?absconders left in order to stay connected with significant others outside, or to avoid difficult relationships with staff or peers within the residence. Boredom motivated absconding, as did feeling that their freedom or autonomy was stifled in care, with no-smoking rules influencing the many young smokers to leave. Care system factors, especially lack of information about their placements and care, frustrated young people and motivated absconding. This mix of individual, relational and contextual factors contributes to understanding why youth abscond and what might work to ultimately prevent and reduce rates of absconding. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Public attitudes; Punishment; Rehabilitation; Restorative justice; Youth offending,,2-s2.0-85053826337

For children and adolescents, these programs typically rely on school-based group designs tied with a health curriculum, whereas innovative technology-based programs are relatively understudied. Methods: This experiment investigated the feasibility and efficacy of a gratitude text-messaging program for promoting adolescent mental health relative to a positive reflective control condition. Results: Young people showed positive changes over the course of the program in their general sense of gratitude, subjective well-being, and reduced depressive symptoms, with some evidence that those with higher levels of depressive symptoms benefited more from the gratitude program. However, there were no significant differences across the two groups in the magnitude of these mental health changes. Participants in both conditions valued and were highly engaged with the interactive text-messaging approach. Conclusion: This interactive e-health promotion strategy seemed to promote strong engagement and showed promising effectiveness with young people, with some challenges to feasibility due to the labor intensive nature of sending and responding to a large number of text-messages. The importance of carefully considering risk management strategies when developing such programs was also highlighted. ? 2018 The International Association of Applied Psychology",adolescence; gratitude; health promotion; mental health; text-message,adolescent; adult; depression; feasibility study; female; health promotion; human; male; New Zealand; procedures; program development; satisfaction; telemedicine; text messaging; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Depression; Feasibility Studies; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Personal Satisfaction; Program Development; Telemedicine; Text Messaging; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85053546058

They had all been well babies with no identified risk factors for hearing loss and hence were not scheduled for targeted follow-up to retest hearing. Methods: There were 485 children (69%) that attended the recall. The average age was 36 months (SD 3.7). Family ethnicity was Pacific Island (36%), Asian (26%), NZ European (13%), and M?ori (11%), and there was a high level of deprivation in the study population. Children were screened using distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) and a parent or caregiver completed a 14-item questionnaire about ear health. The children that did not pass screening were given appointments for audiology testing. Children with hearing loss and/or middle ear problems were referred for otolaryngology review and further hearing assessments. Results: About one third (36%; n = 176) of children did not pass DPOAE screening; 82 (17%) had abnormal type B tympanograms and hearing loss; 29 underwent insertion of ventilation tubes, and one had a perforated tympanic membrane. There was a significant association between failed tympanometry and hearing loss (Chi-squared = 16.67, p <.001). Five children had permanent sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), two of whom required cochlear implants for idiopathic hearing loss, with no specific risk factors. Overall 380 of 485 children screened were deemed to have normal hearing (i.e. 22% failed hearing). From the questionnaire, 15% of the caregivers with no suspicion of hearing problems did have children with significant hearing loss. Regression analysis showed that Pacific/M?ori ethnicity was significantly associated with risk of hearing loss, together with questionnaire items identifying hearing problems and breathing problems. Conclusions: There is a high proportion of children in South Auckland with unsuspected hearing loss; a different approach to hearing screening is warranted for this population with high rates of middle ear disease at age 3. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Audiometry; DPOAE; Hearing loss; Otitis media; Otolaryngology; Preschool children; Screening; Tympanometry,"Article; Asian; asymptomatic disease; auditory screening; caregiver; child; cross-sectional study; disease association; eardrum perforation; ethnicity; European; female; follow up; hearing impairment; hearing test; human; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); middle ear disease; otoacoustic emission; Pacific islands; parent; perception deafness; preschool child; priority journal; questionnaire; risk factor; tympanometry; acoustic impedance; cochlea prosthesis; ethnic group; hearing test; middle ear ventilation; New Zealand; otitis media; perception deafness; spontaneous otoacoustic emission; statistics and numerical data; Acoustic Impedance Tests; Child, Preschool; Cochlear Implants; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; Female; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Hearing Tests; Humans; Male; Middle Ear Ventilation; New Zealand; Otitis Media; Otoacoustic Emissions, Spontaneous; Tympanic Membrane Perforation",2-s2.0-85052641597

This change is implicated in the disease-associated changes in chondrocyte phenotype and cartilage loss. Why the clock is changed is unknown. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) are critical for regulating the hypothalamic clock. Chondrocytes also express NMDAR and the type of NMDAR subunits expressed changes in osteoarthritis. Objective: To determine if NMDAR regulate the chondrocyte clock and phenotype. Design: Chondrocytes isolated from macroscopically-normal (MN) and osteoarthritic human cartilage were treated with NMDAR antagonists or transfected with GRIN2A or GRIN2B-targetting siRNA. H5 chondrocytes were transfected with GluN2B-expression plasmids. Clock genes and chondrocyte phenotypic markers were measured by RT-qPCR. Results: PER2 amplitude was higher and BMAL1 amplitude lower in osteoarthritic compared to MN chondrocytes. In osteoarthritic chondrocytes, NMDAR inhibition restored PER2 and BMAL1 expression to levels similar to MN chondrocytes, and resulted in reduced MMP13 and COL10A1. Paradoxically, NMDAR inhibition in MN chondrocytes resulted in increased PER2, decreased BMAL1 and increased MMP13 and COL10A1. Osteoarthritic, but not MN chondrocytes expressed GluN2B NMDAR subunits. GluN2B knockdown in osteoarthritic chondrocytes restored expression of circadian clock components and phenotypic markers to levels similar to MN chondrocytes. Ectopic expression of GluN2B resulted in reduced BMAL1, increased PER2 and altered SOX9, RUNX2 and MMP13 expression. Knockdown of PER2 mitigated the effects of GluN2B on SOX9 and MMP13. Conclusions: NMDAR regulate the chondrocyte clock and phenotype suggesting NMDAR may also regulate clocks in other peripheral tissues.

This is a follow-on study to examine how this information has changed after 10?years. Methods: Following a Google search, the top 20 webpages on each of the three ENT procedures, tonsillectomy, septoplasty, and myringoplasty, were analyzed. Results: Webpages gave on average 50.6% of the critical information a patient should know prior to undergoing surgery. This is a drop from 2007 (65.5%). Over 96.8% were found to have no inaccuracies identified on the available information provided on the websites. This was slightly higher than in 2007 (94.7%).

The types of interventions evaluated in randomised clinical trials might not reflect the diversity of those employed in clinical practice. Methods: We assessed the types of primary outcome, types of intervention and sponsorship of 360 randomised clinical trials evaluating 416 interventions, published in seven major general medical journals and 10 speciality medical journals in five clinical disciplines. Results: Primary outcomes were surrogate in 223/360 (62%) trials. Neither type of journal nor source of sponsorship was associated with type of primary outcome. Among the interventions evaluated, 233/416 (56%) were drugs, 17/416 (4%) devices and 49/416 (12%) procedures. The majority of trials were non-industry funded (220/360, 61%). Trials of drug interventions and those with industry sponsorship were more common in specialty than general journals (68% vs 48% and 55% vs 25%, respectively). Industry sponsorship was not associated with results for the primary outcome but was strongly associated with trials of drugs and devices. Within the groups of both general and speciality journals, there were wide ranges in the prevalence of industry funding (7-63% and 37-70%, respectively), but in all cases the prevalence of hard primary outcomes was <40%. Conclusions: Most randomised clinical trials published in influential journals reported surrogate primary outcomes and assessed drug interventions. Trials that evaluated devices and procedures were infrequently published, despite the prominence of each type of intervention in clinical practice. Industry funding was more common for trials published in specialty than general journals but was not associated with more positive results for primary outcomes or with a greater preponderance of surrogate outcomes. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Interventions; Outcomes; Randomised clinical trials; Sponsorship; Surrogate,Article; clinical outcome; clinical practice; device therapy; funding; internal medicine; medical literature; medical procedures; medical research; outcome assessment; pharmaceutical care; prevalence; publication; randomized controlled trial (topic); bioassay; comparative study; conflict of interest; drug industry; economics; financial management; health care cost; human; journal impact factor; methodology; procedures; publication; treatment outcome; Conflict of Interest; Drug Industry; Endpoint Determination; Health Care Sector; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Periodicals as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Research Support as Topic; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85055618203

These medications, available over-the-counter, have the potential to cause adverse events if usage/safety information is not adhered to. This study aimed to investigate caregivers' knowledge about the safe use of a commonly purchased children's formulation containing ibuprofen. Methods: A convenience sample of caregivers in Australia and New Zealand, who had purchased Nurofen? for Children, completed an online survey assessing their knowledge of product information and dosage instructions available on/in the product packaging. Results: In total, 219 caregivers (mainly female 95%, mean age ± SD; 35 ± 6.82 years) completed the online survey. Responses suggest limitations in their knowledge about the active ingredients, contraindications and side effect profile associated with the product. Most respondents had a good understanding about the correct dosage to give children based on their weight and/or age, but many lacked a good understanding about the correct interval between doses and the maximum number of daily doses. Conclusions: These findings suggest that caregivers administering ibuprofen to children have gaps in their product knowledge. Strategies to help improve caregivers' knowledge about the safe administration of these products should be prioritised in an attempt to reduce the likelihood of children experiencing ibuprofen related adverse events. Improving caregiver knowledge to address these gaps is an important issue for all health care providers. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Adverse drug events; Caregivers; Children; Ibuprofen; Knowledge,"ibuprofen; ibuprofen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; age; Article; Australian; body weight; caregiver; child care; child safety; controlled study; drug contraindication; drug formulation; drug information; drug safety; female; health personnel attitude; human; male; New Zealander; aged; attitude to health; Australia; caregiver; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; drug administration; drug labeling; health care survey; Internet; middle aged; New Zealand; psychology; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Australia; Caregivers; Contraindications, Drug; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Labeling; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Ibuprofen; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Parents; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85055080890

Alternative formulations include those prepared with hydrolysed bovine milk proteins or from alternate bovidae species, such as caprine (goat) milk. Currently, there is little data on protein digestive and metabolic responses following ingestion of fortified milk drinks. To examine the digestive and metabolic responses to commercially-available fortified milks, young adults (n = 15 males: 15 females), in a randomised sequence, ingested isonitrogenous quantities of whole cow-protein (WC), whole goat-protein (WG), or partially-hydrolysed whey cow-protein (HC), commercial fortified milks. Plasma amino acid (AA) and hormonal responses were measured at baseline and again at 5 h after ingestion. Paracetamol recovery, breath hydrogen, and subjective digestive responses were also measured. Postprandial plasma AA was similar between WC and WG, while AA appearance was suppressed with HC. Following HC, there was a negative incremental AUC in plasma branched-chain AAs. Further, HC had delayed gastric emptying, increased transit time, and led to exaggerated insulin and GLP-1 responses, in comparison to whole protein formulas. Overall, WC and WG had similar protein and digestive responses with no differences in digestive comfort. Contrastingly, HC led to delayed gastric emptying, attenuated AA appearance, and a heightened circulating insulin response. ? 2018 by the authors.

AIM: To audit the quality of ethnicity data captured by the Waikato Hospital Trauma Registry and Waikato Hospital patient management system against self-identified ethnicity. METHOD: Self-identified ethnicity using the New Zealand Census ethnicity question was gathered from 100 consecutive trauma patients and compared with ethnicity recorded in their Trauma Registry record and in the hospital’s patient management database. RESULTS: Twenty-nine (29%) participants self-identified as M?ori, of whom six were classified as New Zealand European (NZE) only in the Trauma Registry and five as NZE on the hospital patient management database. Over half of M?ori (n=18/29) reported more than one ethnicity compared with 4% (n=3/71) of non-M?ori. Self-identified ethnicity matched Trauma Registry ethnicity for one quarter (n=7/29) of M?ori versus 9% of non-M?ori. CONCLUSIONS: The degree of misclassification of M?ori ethnicity data among patients in the Waikato Trauma Registry and the Waikato Hospital patient management system highlights a need for improvements to how ethnicity data is captured within these databases and potentially many other similar entities collecting ethnicity data in New Zealand. The release of revised standardised protocols for the collection of ethnicity data is timely given the recent establishment of a national trauma registry. Without quality data, the opportunity to investigate and address ethnic inequities in trauma incidence and management is greatly compromised. ?

The primary objective of this research is to examine the effect that mirror therapy combined with functional electrical stimulation has on upper limb motor recovery and functional outcome for a sample of people admitted to an inpatient stroke unit. Methods: A total of 50 participants were randomised to one of three treatment arms; Functional Electrical Stimulation, Mirror therapy or a combined intervention of Functional Electrical Stimulation with Mirror therapy. Socio-demographic and health information was collected at recruitment together with admission dates, medical diagnoses and baseline measures. Blinded assessments were undertaken at baseline and at discharge post-stroke by a registered physiotherapist and a clinical nurse specialist. Results: The Action Research Arm Test and the Fugl–Meyer Upper Extremity assessment revealed statistically superior results for Functional Electrical Stimulation compared with Mirror therapy alone (p = 0.03). There were no other significant differences between the three groups. Conclusion: The theory of combining interventions requires further investigation and warrants further research. Combining current interventions may have the potential to enhance stroke rehabilitation, improve functional outcomes and help reduce the overall burden of stroke. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",electrotherapy; motor learning; motor recovery; physiotherapy; rehabilitation; Stroke,adult; article; clinical article; clinical nurse specialist; controlled study; diagnosis; drug combination; female; functional electrical stimulation; hospital patient; human; male; medical information; motor learning; physiotherapist; physiotherapy; randomized controlled trial; remission; stroke rehabilitation; stroke unit; theoretical study; upper limb,2-s2.0-85047127598

Introduction: Little research has been conducted into PTG internationally. PTG can have particular ethical implications within the field of mental health. This study was undertaken to identify the extent of PTG by New Zealand mental healthcare professionals and needs for further guidance regarding this issue. Materials and Methods: All (1,850) psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and psychotherapists working in New Zealand were electronically surveyed about their experience of PTG and knowledge about the associated practice of therapist-targeted Googling (TTG) using a questionnaire that had previously been developed with a German sample. Due to ethics and advertising restrictions, only one indirect approach was made to potential participants. Results: Eighty-eight clinicians (5%) responded to the survey invitation. More than half (53.4%, N = 47) of respondents reportedly being engaged in PTG, but only a minority (10.3%, N = 9) had ever received any education about the subject. Reasons for undertaking PTG included facilitating the therapeutic process, information being in the public domain, and mitigating risks. Reasons against undertaking PTG included impairment of therapeutic relationship, unethical invasion of privacy, and concerns regarding the accuracy and clinical relevance of online information. Two-thirds of participants reported being the subject of TTG. Discussion: New Zealand psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, and psychotherapists are engaging in PTG with limited education and professional guidance. Further discussion and research are required, and so, PTG is undertaken in a manner that is safe and useful for patients and health practitioners. ?

Background: Healthcare guidelines and clinical protocols provide important guidance and direction to health professionals in their delivery of care. By detailing requirements and actions to be taken in specified circumstances or contexts, these documents may facilitate a broadening of the pool of people able to deliver care. Design: Critical reading of four clinical protocols representing the range of protocol types in use was carried out to consider the extent to which the documentation of guidelines and protocols and the documents themselves might be considered as vehicles for increased collaboration in health care. Methods: A “close reading” rubric was developed directing the researcher to look for evidence in each protocol of the following: authorship, person or group responsible for the protocol's development; stated document purpose; target readers, either stated or implied; the particular subjects, the document names and the objects created by them such as care pathways; the use of specific terminology and imagery, the documents’ form and structure; and evidence of intertextuality referring to other documents, for example legislation or policy statements. Tabulation of the coding analysis is presented. Results: Nurses were the only professional group named in the documents as assignees or subjects. “Patients” and “care” are the objects created, and the scientific–biomedical discourse with its associated procedural language was dominant. Conclusions: Many protocols have been developed to standardise practice and increase the effectiveness of teamwork. They may, however, constrain collaboration in healthcare settings because they diminish a nursing “voice” and create the expectation that nurses alone work across the spectrum of protocols. Relevance to clinical practice: An unintended consequence of the global use of clinical protocols and guidelines to support safe and efficient healthcare delivery may be to reduce interprofessional collaboration. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",clinical guidelines; discourse analysis; interdisciplinary health team; New Zealand; nurses; patient care; standard of care,adult; article; clinical protocol; controlled study; discourse analysis; documentation; expectation; health care delivery; human; imagery; language; law; New Zealand; nomenclature; nurse; patient care; practice guideline; scientist; teamwork; voice; writing; cooperation; health personnel attitude; intersectoral collaboration; organization and management; public relations; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Protocols; Cooperative Behavior; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Intersectoral Collaboration,2-s2.0-85053062964

Globally, SIDS exhibit exceptionally high rates of non-communicable disease (NCD) risk and incidence. Despite this, there is a lack of context-specific research within SIDS focused on life course approaches to NCD prevention, particularly the impact of the early-life environment on later disease risk as defined by the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) framework. Given that globalization has contributed to significant nutritional transitions in these populations, the DOHaD paradigm is highly relevant. SIDS in the Pacific region have the highest rates of NCD risk and incidence globally. Transitions from traditional foods grown locally to reliance on importation of Western-style processed foods high in fat and sugar are common. The Cook Islands is one Pacific SIDS that reports this transition, alongside rising overweight/obesity rates, currently 91%/72%, in the adult population. However, research on early-life NCD prevention within this context, as in many low- and middle-income countries, is scarce. Although traditional research emphasizes the need for large sample sizes, this is rarely possible in the smaller SIDS. In these vulnerable, high priority countries, consideration should be given to utilizing 'small' sample sizes that encompass a high proportion of the total population. This may enable contextually relevant research, crucial to inform NCD prevention strategies that can contribute to improving health and well-being for these at-risk communities. ?

Concurrently facing an end-of-life illness can result in existential distress affecting quality of dying. This study aimed to explore the lived experience of migrants dying away from their country of birth or origin. Methods: The study design used a phenomenological approach using Heidegger’s philosophy to gather and interpret dying migrants’ stories. Participants were a purposive sample of New Zealand immigrants experiencing end-of-life illness and under hospice care. Participants were interviewed at home. Coherent stories were drawn from the transcribed interviews and analysed using iterative methods. Interpretive notions were formed through contemplation and writing. Results: The ten participants, seven males and three females, were of different ethnicities and countries of origin. Three notions emerged. The first was dual possession of a new hybrid identity developed in their adoptive country, and an inner ethnic and cultural identity, in varying degrees of harmony with each other. The second was being in life review—reliving homeland memories and letting go of dreams. The third notion showed how they sought resolution by enacting continuity through their children, hoping for a final homeland visit, or conveying their dying wishes. Conclusions: How life review was enacted for each migrant and resolution depended on finding some degree of belonging in their country of adoption. Implications for end-of-life care include education to increase practitioner awareness and use of formal and informal life review. Enhancing spiritual well-being can assist resolution of end-of-life adjustment. ? 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Belonging; End-of-life; Identity; Interpretive phenomenology; Migrants; New Zealand,"adult; aged; Article; clinical article; dying; female; geographic origin; human; male; middle aged; migrant; personal experience; phenomenology; priority journal; terminal care; very elderly; migrant; migration; procedures; psychology; quality of life; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Terminal Care; Transients and Migrants",2-s2.0-85048369086

Aim: The aim of this study was to identify how midwives managed the last second-degree perineal tear they treated and the level to which their practice reflects National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines. Methods: An (anonymous) online survey was conducted over a six-week period in 2013. New Zealand midwives who self-identified as currently practising perineal management and could recall management of the last second-degree tear they treated were included in the analysis. Findings: Of those invited, 645 (57.1% self-employed, 42.9% employed) were eligible and completed surveys. Self-employed midwives reported greater confidence (88.0% vs 74.4%, p < 0.001) and more recent experience (85.1% vs 57.4%, p < 0.001) with perineal repair than employed midwives. Midwives who left the last second-degree tear unsutured (7.3%) were more likely to report low confidence (48.9% vs 15.4%, p < 0.001) and less recent experience with repair (53.2% vs 24.7%, p < 0.001), and were less likely to report a digital-rectal examination (10.6% vs 49.0%, p < 0.001), compared to midwives who sutured. Care consistent with evidence-based guidelines (performing a digital-rectal examination, 59.4% vs 49.3% p = 0.005; optimal suturing techniques, 62.2% vs 48.7%, p = 0.001) was associated with recent perineal education. Conclusions: Midwives’ management of the last second-degree perineal tear is variable and influenced by factors including: employment status, experience, confidence, and perineal education. There is potential for improvement in midwives’ management through increased uptake of evidence-based guidelines and through ongoing education. ? 2017 Australian College of Midwives",Childbirth; Midwives; Perineal trauma; Perineum; Second-degree tear,"chlorhexidine; lidocaine; nitrous oxide plus oxygen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; paracetamol; suture material; adult; Article; cross-sectional study; digital rectal examination; employment status; episiotomy; ethnicity; female; healing; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; midwife; New Zealand; perineum injury; practice guideline; priority journal; injuries; labor complication; laceration; obstetric delivery; perineum; pregnancy; procedures; professional competence; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delivery, Obstetric; Female; Humans; Lacerations; Midwifery; New Zealand; Obstetric Labor Complications; Perineum; Pregnancy; Professional Competence; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85039044746

METHOD: A retrospective review of medical records was conducted at Middlemore Hospital to identify adult patients with PV diagnosed between 1987 and 2007. Data extracted included diagnostic criteria, ethnicity, age, complications and survival. RESULTS: Eighty-eight adult patients with PV were identified during 1987–2007, 49 (55.7%) were Europeans and 36 (40.9%) Polynesians. The most striking finding was that Polynesian patients presented almost 14 years younger than Europeans (mean age of 54 years versus [vs] 68, respectively; P&lt;.001). The white cell and platelet counts were higher in Polynesians compared with Europeans (mean white cell count of 22x10 9 /L vs 13x10 9 /L; mean platelet count of 648x10 9 /L vs 512x10 9 /L, respectively; P&lt;.05 for both). The rate of JAK2 V617F mutation in Polynesians was 96%, equivalent to other large cohorts of European patients. The rates of long-term complications were comparable between Polynesians and Europeans, but the predicted impact on life expectancy was more severe for Polynesians. CONCLUSION: New Zealand Polynesian patients present with a distinctive PV phenotype. Their younger age at presentation suggests a different risk factor profile or a higher genetic susceptibility. We hope our observations initiate larger epidemiological and genetic studies to help elucidate the cause. ?

Prior research suggests non-response may be endogenously related to patient characteristics. METHOD: We re-contacted a convenience sample of non-responders to a nationally representative, cross-sectional inpatient survey conducted in New Zealand. Participants were given a subset of six items drawn from the initial survey and the opportunity to disclose reasons for non-response. Responders to follow-up (n=163) were subsequently compared with responders to the initial survey (n=910) using chi-squared tests of association and logistic regression to assess differences in sociodemographic variables and substantive responses. RESULTS: We find no significant differences in the responses given by initial and follow-up responders. The most common reasons for non-response were “can’t remember” (33%), not receiving the survey (25%) or being too busy at the time (25%). CONCLUSION: Responders to follow-up have similar experiences of inpatient care in New Zealand to initial responders. Further study is needed to strengthen inferences regarding hard-to-reach patients. ?

We aimed to develop and validate a predictive model using NZ data for this population, and compare its performance to a widely used overseas model, the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI). METHODS: We developed a model to predict 10-year breast cancer-specific survival, using data collected prospectively in the largest population-based regional breast cancer registry in NZ (Auckland, 9182 patients), and assessed its performance in this data set (internal validation) and in an independent NZ population-based series of 2625 patients in Waikato (external validation). The data included all women with primary invasive breast cancer diagnosed from 1 June 2000 to 30 June 2014, with follow up to death or Dec 31, 2014. We used multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression to assess predictors and to calculate predicted 10-year breast cancer mortality, and therefore survival, probability for each patient. We assessed observed survival by the Kaplan Meier method. We assessed discrimination by the C statistic, and calibration by comparing predicted and observed survival rates for patients in 10 groups ordered by predicted 10-year survival. We compared this NZ model with the Nottingham Prognostic Index (NPI) in this validation data set.

However, based on the documented impact of improving economies, a mean RN age of about 50, and just-agreed substantive increases in RN pay rates, it is likely that many will soon leave or reduce the hours they work. This study aims to investigate whether improved financial security will encourage RNs to leave or reduce their work commitment and to identify the factors that influence such intentions. METHODS: An exploratory study using a cross-sectional survey design. Data were collected in 2014-2015 via an e-survey of 2,910 RNs in New Zealand. Data were analysed by regression. RESULTS: We found that due to ""burnout"" and low ""work engagement"", both of which are strongly affected by workload and work-life interference, 22.6% of the RNs surveyed plan to leave work altogether and a further 32% plan to reduce their workforce participation when their financial situations improve.

ISS consists largely of normal children with the remainder unrecognised conditions, mainly syndromes and genetic (monogenic and polygenic) causes. Growth response to rhGH is widely variable reflecting the heterogeneity of ISS. Further identification of genetic causes of ISS will better characterise treatment response. rhGH during childhood has been shown in RCTs to improve adult height by approximately 4 cm which is less than seen in other treated growth disorders. Factors that influence response include; younger age, longer birth length, lower height compared to mid-parental height, delayed bone age and larger rhGH dose. The evidence that short stature is associated with psychological well-being and quality of life is minimal and that rhGH could improve this is scant. Further research in this area is urgently required.

It is characterized by the impairment of renal proximal tubular function leading to normoglycemic glycosuria, aminoaciduria, hypophosphatemia, hypouricemia and proximal renal tubular acidosis. Renal impairment in monoclonal gammopathy, without fulfilling the criteria of multiple myeloma, is categorized as monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS). Patient concerns: A 54-year-old male presented with progressively aggravated bone pain and limitation of activity was admitted to our department. A proximal renal tubular damage was suggested by hypophosphatemia, compensated metabolic acidosis, renal glycosuria, aminoaciduria, and hypouricemia. M-protein of IgA kappa was detected by immunofixation electrophoresis. Mildly increased plasma cells were found in bone marrow cytomorphologic examination. Renal biopsy revealed diffuse linear monoclonal IgA-kappa light chain deposits along tubular basement membranes (TBMs), while lambda was negative. Electron microscopy showed granular electron-dense deposits along the outer aspect of TBMs. Diagnoses: The patient was diagnosed as FS induced osteomalacia secondary to monoclonal gammopathy of renal significance (MGRS) (IgA-k type) and LCDD. Interventions: He was treated with bortezomib, supplementation by phosphate, alkali agents, and active vitamin D. He responded well to the treatment symptomatically. Outcomes: We reported a rare case of adult acquired FS with hypophosphatemic osteomalacia secondary to LCDD associated with MGRS and the patient was successfully treated with bortezomib.

Univariate linear regression coefficients for age, male sex, height, body weight, body mass index, and Polynesian ethnicity were positive and significant (P < 0.05). Apart from body mass index, subsequent multivariate analysis showed that all regression coefficients remained positive and significant (P < 0.05). Polynesian ethnicity seemed to be an independent predictor for increased heart weight in the study population. Apart from possible genetic factors, the higher heart weight in Polynesians may have other underlying reasons.

Methods: We report one of the most extreme cases of massive ascites caused by endometriosis. For literature review, MEDLINE via OVID (from 1946 to 2016) database was searched. As a result, all the publications based on the keywords relating to the review topic were acquired. Case: A 32-year-old nulliparous woman, with stage 4 endometriosis and primary infertility, presented with massive ascites, complex pelvic mass, pleural effusion, weight loss, anaemia and elevated CA-125 suggesting ovarian malignancy. Six litres of ascites was drained. After extensive investigations to exclude malignancy, endometriosis-related ascites was diagnosed. Red-cell transfusion, nasogastric-tube-feeding and gonadotrophin-releasing-hormone analogue were initiated and long-term follow-up is planned. Ablation of ovarian function either by surgical oophorectomy or ovarian irradiation appears to cure the condition without recurrence. Endocrine therapy, in the form of gonadotrophin-releasing-hormone analogue or progestins, is useful if surgery is undesirable, as most women with this condition are young and wish to preserve fertility. Endocrine therapy alone resolves the problem in the majority, but ascites reappears after stopping treatment. Conclusion: Endometriosis associated with massive ascites and pleural effusion is rare. There are less than 30 similar case reports in the literature. In women of reproductive age who present with clinical and imaging features to suggest ovarian malignancy, a diagnosis of endometriosis should be considered. Although permanent cure is by oophorectomy, endocrine therapy is useful if surgery is undesirable. ?

An American Heart Association review recently identified a variety of medicines that may cause or exacerbate heart failure (HF), many with evidence from limited evaluation of population data. We assessed the risk of first-time HF associated with the use of 50 of these medicines by New Zealand's primary care population. Methods: Case-control study utilising national pharmaceutical use and hospital admissions data 2007-2015; 22,989 patients with first-time HF 2008-2015 were matched with 114?498 control patients. The primary outcome was first-time HF and its association with medicine exposure in the prior 90?days, estimated using conditional logistic regression. We also assessed the risk associated with new use of medicines in the prior month, concurrent use, and in patients with existing comorbidity. Results: Eleven medicines were significantly associated with HF with several other infrequently used medicines providing signals of increased risk. A high risk was associated with the use of salbutamol (adjusted odds ratio 2.63; 95% CI, 2.48-2.78), clozapine (2.70; 2.46-4.98), diltiazem (1.52; 1.44-1.60), indomethacin (2.51; 1.54-4.10), pioglitazone (1.50; 1.16-1.95), and antifungal medicines. New use of medicines and use of medicine combinations increased this risk in many cases. Conclusions: Our study provides further evidence to inform cautious use of these medicines in patients with HF or at risk of developing HF. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",adverse drug event; heart failure; pharmacoepidemiology; pharmacovigilance; primary health care; risk,"2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; amphotericin B; antifungal agent; bosentan; bromocriptine; carbamazepine; citalopram; clozapine; diltiazem; disopyramide; doxazosin; ergotamine; flecainide; indometacin; itraconazole; lithium carbonate; metformin; minoxidil; nifedipine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; pergolide; pioglitazone; pramipexole; prazosin; salbutamol; sotalol; tamsulosin; terazosin; tricyclic antidepressant agent; verapamil; antifungal agent; clozapine; diltiazem; indometacin; pioglitazone; salbutamol; adult; Article; cardiovascular risk; case control study; clinical assessment; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; drug exposure; female; heart failure; high risk patient; hospital admission; human; knowledge base; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; population; primary medical care; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; adverse event; aged; combination drug therapy; follow up; health service; heart failure; hospitalization; middle aged; New Zealand; primary health care; procedures; propensity score; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Albuterol; Antifungal Agents; Case-Control Studies; Clozapine; Diltiazem; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Services Needs and Demand; Heart Failure; Hospitalization; Humans; Indomethacin; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Pioglitazone; Primary Health Care; Propensity Score; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85050514394

Often there is a trade-off in maximising efficiency vis a vis equity and the relative weight given to one goal over the other is acknowledged to be essentially a value judgement. Health systems necessarily make those value judgements but in making them would benefit from relevant and accurate opportunity cost information. Unfortunately the development of practical tools to measure equity-efficiency trade-offs has lagged theoretical advances in this area. We address this gap by presenting a practical technique to reveal opportunity costs of equity (and efficiency) gains in decentralised population-based health systems, applying stochastic data envelopment analysis to ethnic-specific life expectancy (LE) changes for 20 New Zealand (NZ) District Health Boards for the inter-census period 2006–2013, thereby deriving a notional health frontier from 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations. Four different ways to increase health equity emerge. These show that a trade-off between equity and efficiency does not always exist. In particular, improving both productive efficiency and allocative efficiency (up to its maximum) can also yield gains in equity through reductions in LE inequalities. However, in NZ's case, the opportunity cost (in sacrificed European life-years) of achieving gains in equity beyond the point of maximum productive and allocative efficiency is relatively high, even for quite small reductions in the LE gap between M?ori and European populations. This high opportunity cost may explain why, despite governments’ strong rhetorical commitment to equity, NZ's health gains have not strayed far from the path of maximising allocative efficiency. Nevertheless, this opportunity cost could be reduced significantly by measures which shift the health frontier outward, highlighting the importance of technical and organisational innovation as potential drivers of greater equity in health outcomes. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency; Equity; Health frontier; M?ori; New Zealand,computer simulation; data envelopment analysis; equity; health care; Monte Carlo analysis; trade-off; article; driver; European; government; health equity; human; life expectancy; Monte Carlo method; New Zealand; organization; population health; stochastic model; theoretical study; Caucasian; epidemiology; ethnology; health disparity; health equity; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; population health; population research; statistics and numerical data; Censuses; European Continental Ancestry Group; Health Equity; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Life Expectancy; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Population Health,2-s2.0-85049984918

We aimed to determine whether the target was associated with changes in time to CT and appropriateness of CT imaging, as markers of care quality for suspected acute traumatic brain injury (TBI). We undertook a retrospective review of the case records of a random sample of people aged ?15 years presenting to the ED with TBI from 2006 to 2013. General linear models were used to investigate changes in outcomes along with routine process times before and after the introduction of the target. Among 501 eligible cases the median (IQR) time to CT was 136 (76–247) pre target versus 119 (59–209) minutes post target, p = 0.014. The proportion of appropriate imaging was similar between periods: 77.9% (95% CI 71–83%) versus 76.6% (95%CI 72–81%), p = 0.825. Interactions suggested that the time to CT and appropriateness of imaging before and after the introduction of the target varied by ethnicity, although the changes were not clinically important. Time to assessment and length of stay did not change importantly. We found no evidence of a clinically important change in time to CT or appropriateness of imaging for suspected TBI in association with the introduction of the SSED time target.

Methods: A systematic review to identify mild-TBI sub-classification systems was conducted until March 2016. The identified systems were applied to a cohort of N = 290 adults who had experienced a mild-TBI, and who had been assessed for post-concussion symptoms 1-year post injury. ANOVAs and regression models were used to determine whether each sub-classification system could distinguish between outcomes and to explore their contribution to explaining variance in post-concussion symptoms 1-year post injury. Results: Nineteen sub-classification systems for mild-TBI met the inclusion criteria for this review. The Saal (1991) classification system significantly differentiated the experience of post-concussion symptoms in our cohort 1-year post injury (F = 2.39, p = 0.05). However, the findings did not remain significant following correction for multiple comparisons and inclusion of socio-demographic and contextual factors in the regression model. Conclusions: Current sub-classification systems fail to explain much of the variance in post-concussion symptoms 1 year following mild-TBI. Further research is needed to identify the factors (including socio-demographic and contextual factors) to determine, who may be at risk of developing persistent post-concussion symptoms. Copyright ?

Atrial arrhythmias are frequently observed pre- and post-surgical correction. Pharmaceutical antiarrhythmic therapy is not always effective, therefore many symptomatic patients undergo catheter ablation therapy. In patients with atrioventricular septal defects (AVSD), ablation therapy itself has mixed success; arrhythmogenic recurrences are common, and because of the anatomical displacement of the atrioventricular node, 3-degree heart block post-ablation is a real concern. In order to develop optimal and safe ablation strategies, the field of congenital cardiac electrophysiology must combine knowledge from clinical electrophysiology with a thorough understanding of the anatomical substrates for arrhythmias. Using image-based analysis and multi-cellular mathematical modeling of electrical activation, we show how the anatomical alterations characteristic of an AVSD serve as arrhythmogenic substrates. Using ex-vivo contrast enhanced micro-computed tomography we imaged post-mortem the heart of a 5 month old male with AVSD at an isometric spatial resolution of 38 μm. Morphological analysis revealed the 3D disposition of the cardiac conduction system for the first time in an intact heart with this human congenital malformation. We observed displacement of the compact atrioventricular node inferiorly to the ostium of the coronary sinus. Myocyte orientation analysis revealed that the normal arrangement of the major atrial muscle bundles was preserved but was modified in the septal region. Models of electrical activation suggest the disposition of the myocytes within the atrial muscle bundles associated with the ""fast pathway,"" together with the displaced atrioventricular node, serve as potential substrates for re-entry and possibly atrial fibrillation. This study used archived human hearts, showing them to be a valuable resource for the mathematical modeling community, and opening new possibilities for the investigations of arrhythmogenesis and ablation strategies in the congenitally malformed heart. ? 2018 Stephenson, Rowley-Nobel, Jones, Guerrero, Lowe, Zhao, Zhang and Jarvis.",Arrhythmias cardiac; Atrial fibrillation (AF); Atrioventricular septal defect; Congenital heart disease (CHD); Mathematical modeling; Micro-computed tomography; Myocyte orientation; Re-entry,arrhythmogenesis; Article; atrial fibrillation; atrioventricular septal defect; autopsy; contrast enhancement; ex vivo study; heart atrioventricular node; heart atrium muscle; heart muscle conduction system; heart tissue; image analysis; infant; male; mathematical model; micro-computed tomography; muscle cell; nonhuman; tissue structure,2-s2.0-85052219851

Both will not be shaken by professional or practice factors that, if positive, will only reinforce the depth of commitment to the region. CONCLUSIONS: When selecting students or GP registrars to provincial areas or recruiting new GPs to those areas, the values, family connections and lifestyle desires of the candidate and their family should match the environment offered by the region in order to improve retention in that region. ?

However, its oral absorption is low due to poor aqueous solubility of less than 1 μg/ml. A microemulsion delivery system was designed to solubilize beta-carotene toward enhancing its oral bioavailability. From seven pseudoternary diagrams constructed, three systems were selected with large microemulsion areas suitable for oral administration and dilution in the predominately aqueous gastrointestinal fluids. Conductivity and rheology characterization were conducted along four dilution lines within the selected systems. Three pseudoternary-phase diagrams were selected with large microemulsion regions, >60% of the total phase diagram area, which provide microemulsions with higher drug-loading capacity. A phenomenon was observed by which both propylene glycol and Capmul MCM EP stabilize the microstructure of the microemulsions has been proposed based on the characterization studies. An optimal bicontinuous microemulsion formulation was selected comprising 12% orange oil, 24% Capmul MCM, 18% Tween 20, 6% Labrasol, 20% propylene glycol and 20% water, with a high beta-carotene loading capacity of 140.8 μg/ml and droplet size of 117.4 nm. In conclusion, the developed novel microemulsion formulation allows solubilizing beta-carotene and is a promising basis for further development as a functional beverage. ? 2017, ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Beta-carotene; conductivity; microemulsion; oral delivery; pseudoternary-phase diagram; rheology,"beta carotene; labrasol; octanoin; polysorbate 20; propylene glycol; antioxidant; beta carotene; drug vehicle; aqueous solution; Article; conductance; dilution; drug delivery system; drug formulation; drug solubility; drug stability; flow kinetics; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; measurement accuracy; measurement precision; measurement repeatability; microemulsion; particle size; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; stomach juice; chemistry; emulsion; human; oral drug administration; phase transition; solubility; viscosity; Administration, Oral; Antioxidants; beta Carotene; Emulsions; Humans; Particle Size; Pharmaceutical Vehicles; Phase Transition; Propylene Glycol; Solubility; Viscosity",2-s2.0-85012863435

A lack of empirical data on postinjury disability in children has limited capacity to derive valid disability weights and describe the long-term individual and societal impacts of injury in the early part of life. The aim of this study is to establish valid estimates of the burden of non-fatal injury in children and adolescents. Methods and analysis Five longitudinal studies of paediatric injury survivors 18 years at the time of injury (Australia, Canada, UK and USA) and two whole-of-population linked administrative data paediatric studies (Australia and Wales) will be analysed over a 3-year period commencing 2018. Meta-analysis of deidentified patient-level data (2,600) from five injury-specific longitudinal studies (Victorian State Trauma Registry; Victorian Orthopaedic Trauma Outcomes Registry; UK Burden of Injury; British Columbia Children's Hospital Longitudinal Injury Outcomes; Children's Health After Injury) and >1 million children from two whole-of-population cohorts (South Australian Early Childhood Data Project and Wales Electronic Cohort for Children). Systematic analysis of pooled injury-specific cohort data using a variety of statistical techniques, and parallel analysis of whole-of-population cohorts, will be used to develop estimated disability weights for years lost due to disability, establish appropriate injury classifications and explore factors influencing recovery. Ethics and dissemination The project was approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee project number 12 311. Results of this study will be submitted for publication in internationally peer-reviewed journals. The findings from this project have the capacity to improve the validity of paediatric injury burden measurements in future local and global burden of disease studies. ?

Mobile phones are ubiquitous and generally affordable. Objective: This study aimed to adopt a text message (short message service, SMS) smoking cessation program designed in New Zealand (stop smoking with mobile phones, STOMP) for use in Samoa to assist national objectives in reducing the tobacco use. Methods: Using focus groups with smokers and ex-smokers, we explored the context for tobacco use and preferences for SMS text messages. Postintervention focus groups were held after participants received SMS text messages for 1 week. Frequent face-to-face meetings with the primary partner (Ministry of Health Samoa) and key stakeholders contributed to the adaptation process. Participatory feedback and collaboration from stakeholders became an integral part of the cultural adaptation and translation of the program. Furthermore, detailed document analyses were included as part of the formal evaluation of the initiative to explore the core determinants of success in adapting the program to the Samoan cultural context. Results: The SMS text messages evolved remarkably following an iterative process of consultation, in situ testing, revision, and retesting to arrive at an acceptable country-specific version of the mobile smoking cessation program. The SMS text messages retained in the final set were consistent with the theory of behavioral change but reflected both linguistic and cultural nuances appropriate for Samoa. Adapting messages required simultaneous multilevel processes, including complex high-level engagement, between the team and the stakeholders, along with crafting the precise content for (character limited) messages. Conclusions: Receiving cessation support messages through a mobile phone is promising and appears to be an acceptable and accessible mode of delivery for tobacco cessation, particularly in the absence of alternative support. Adapting a text-based program in Samoa requires fastidious attention to the nuances of culture, language, and sociopolitical structures in the country. ?

Methods: Within LiLACS NZ, 256 M?ori and 399 non-M?ori octogenarians were assessed for nutrition risk using the Seniors in the Community: Risk Evaluation for Eating and Nutrition (SCREEN II) questionnaire according to three domains of risk. Sociodemographic and health characteristics were established. Five years from inception, survival analyses examined associations between nutrition risk from the three domains of SCREEN II with all-cause hospital admissions and mortality. Results: For M?ori but not non-M?ori, lower nutrition risk in the Dietary Intake domain was associated with reduced hospitalisations and mortality (Hazard Ratios [HR] [95%CI] 0.97 [0.95–0.99], p=0.009 and 0.91 [0.86–0.98], p=0.005, respectively). The ‘Factors Affecting Intake’ domain was associated with mortality (HR, [95%CI] 0.94 [0.89–1.00], p=0.048), adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic deprivation, education, previous hospital admissions, comorbidities and activities of daily living. Conclusion: Improved dietary adequacy may reduce poor outcomes for older M?ori. Implications for public health: Nutrition risk among older M?ori is identifiable and treatable. Effort is needed to engage relevant community and wh?nau (family) support to ensure older M?ori have food security and cultural food practices are met. ? 2018 The Authors",LiLACS NZ; M?ori; New Zealand; nutrition risk; octogenarian,"article; comorbidity; controlled study; daily life activity; dietary intake; eating; education; female; food security; gender; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; human experiment; male; mortality; New Zealand; nutrition; outcome assessment; public health; questionnaire; risk assessment; survival analysis; systematic review; very elderly; aged; aging; caloric intake; cohort analysis; epidemiology; ethnology; health survey; hospitalization; middle aged; New Zealand; nutritional status; Oceanic ancestry group; physiology; statistics and numerical data; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Cohort Studies; Energy Intake; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; New Zealand; Nutritional Status; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Population Surveillance",2-s2.0-85050807966

However, most of them will not have adverse outcomes. Our aim was to identify antenatal clinical factors associated with neonatal morbidity in large-for-gestational-age infants. Material and methods: Nulliparous women from the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study were included. We compared maternal and fetal factors between large-for-gestational-age infants (birthweight >90th customized centile) with and without neonatal morbidity, defined as admission to a neonatal intensive care unit or severe neonatal morbidity. Factors were selected based on a priori hypotheses of association and included maternal demography, anthropometric measures and self-reported physical activity (15 and 20?weeks), fetal biometry (20?weeks), and clinical information. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify risk factors. Stratified analyses were performed by maternal obesity and physical activity. Results: Among term pregnancies, prevalence of large-for-gestational-age infants was 9.3% (491/5255), with 11.8% (58/491) prevalence of neonatal morbidity. Random glucose at 20?weeks (odds ratio 1.52; 95% confidence interval 1.17–1.97, per 1?mmol/L increase) and no regular physical activity at 20?weeks (odds ratio 3.93; 95% confidence interval 1.75–8.83) were associated with increased risk of neonatal morbidity after adjustment for birthweight, gestational age at delivery and gestational diabetes. The increased risk associated with higher glucose levels was not evident in women with regular physical activity or without obesity. Conclusions: Regular physical activity in mid-pregnancy is associated with lower risk for neonatal morbidity in large-for-gestational-age infants and seems to offer protection against the increased risk associated with higher maternal glucose levels. ? 2018 Nordic Federation of Societies of Obstetrics and Gynecology",adverse outcome; Large-for-gestational age; macrosomia; neonatal morbidity; risk factors,glucose; abdominal circumference; adult; Article; biometry; birth weight; comparative study; controlled study; demography; disease association; disease severity; female; gestational age; glucose level; human; infant; large for gestational age; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; maternal obesity; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn morbidity; nullipara; physical activity; preeclampsia; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; premature labor; prenatal care; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; spontaneous abortion,2-s2.0-85047666511

Our objective was to examine the routinely collected clinical data from a memory assessment service in South Auckland to examine the presentation of dementia in the major NZ ethnic groups. Methods: A total of 360 patients presenting to a memory service with a new diagnosis of dementia were included in this study. Demographic data (age, sex, and ethnicity) and dementia sub-type and severity were analyzed. Results: There were 142 NZ European (mean age: 79.2, SD 7.4), 43 M?ori (mean age: 70.2, SD 7.6), 126 Pacific (mean age: 74.3, SD 7.6), and 49 other ethnicities (mean age: 78.0, SD 8.5) presenting with a new diagnosis of dementia. After adjustment for gender and dementia subtype, M?ori and Pacific patients were 8.5 and 5.3?years younger than NZ European patients (P?<?0.0001). Pacific peoples tended to present with more advanced dementia (OR?=?1.63, 95% CI: 0.98–2.70, P?=?0.06) after adjustment for age and gender. There was little difference in the subtypes of dementia between ethnic groups. Conclusions: M?ori and Pacific peoples with dementia presented to an NZ memory service at a younger age than NZ Europeans, and Pacific peoples presented with more advanced dementia. A population-based epidemiological study is critical to determine whether M?ori and Pacific peoples have indeed a higher risk of developing dementia at a younger age.

Results: Significant shifts in self-report inefficient cognitive style were observed pre/post gCRT with large effect sizes (Cohen's dav) for both cognitive rigidity and attention to detail outcomes. Patient feedback was positive, with themes of enjoyment, increased insight, and positive social interaction/esteem boosting in the context of the group emerging. Conclusions: Support for the acceptability, adaptation, expansion, practicality, and limited-efficacy testing of gCRT in an Australasian day program setting has been found, suggesting integration of this module into existing day treatment programs is merited.

Thus, interhemispheric communication channels may play a relevant part when engaging in mental rotation tasks. Indeed, links between mental rotation and dimensions of the corpus callosum—the brain's main commissure system—have been reported. However, existing findings are sparse and inconsistent across studies. Here we set out to further characterize the nature of any such links, including their exact location across the corpus callosum. For this purpose, we applied an advanced image analysis approach assessing callosal thickness at 100 equidistant points in a sample of 38 healthy adults (19 men, 19 women), aged between 22 and 45 years. We detected a sex interaction, with significant structure–performance relationships in women, but not in men. Specifically, better mental rotation performance was linked to a thicker female corpus callosum within regions of the callosal splenium, posterior midbody, and anterior third. These findings may suggest sex differences in problem solving strategies where in women, more than in men, stronger interhemispheric connectivity—especially between occipitoparietal, frontal, and prefrontal regions—is associated with improved task performance. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",corpus callosum; gender; mental rotation; MRI; sex,"adult; Article; brain function; brain size; cohort analysis; controlled study; corpus callosum; cortical thickness (brain); education; female; handedness; human; image analysis; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; rotation; sex difference; vocabulary; anatomy and histology; brain; corpus callosum; diagnostic imaging; image processing; middle aged; organ size; sex factor; spatial learning; visual-spatial ability test; young adult; Adult; Brain; Corpus Callosum; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Mental Navigation Tests; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Sex Factors; Spatial Learning; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85046770871

Two hundred ninety-five participants with gout (disease duration &lt; 10?years) attended a baseline assessment which included medical and disease-specific history, pain visual analog score and plain radiographs scored for erosion and narrowing. Activity limitation was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire-II (HAQ-II). After 1?year, participants were invited to complete a further HAQ-II; follow-up questionnaires were available for 182 participants. Fully saturated and stepwise regression analyses were used to determine associations between baseline characteristics and HAQ-II at baseline and 1?year, and to determine predictors of worsening HAQ-II in those with normal baseline scores. Median (range) baseline HAQ-II was 0.20 (0–2.50) and 0.20 (0–2.80) after 1?year of follow-up. Pain score was the strongest independent predictor of baseline HAQ-II, followed by radiographic narrowing score, type 2 diabetes, swollen joint count, BMI, age and urate (model R2 = 0.51, P &lt; 0.001). Baseline HAQ-II was the strongest predictor of change in HAQ-II at 1?year, followed by tender joint count (model R2 = 0.19, P &lt; 0.001). Of those with HAQ-II scores of 0 at baseline (n = 59, 32% of those with follow-up data), most did not progress (n = 52, 88%); however, baseline pain score, type 2 diabetes and flare frequency were significant predictors of worsening HAQ-II in this group (R2 = 0.34, P &lt; 0.001). People with gout experience a wide range of activity limitation, and levels of activity limitation are, on average, stable over a 1-year period. Baseline pain scores are strongly associated with activity limitation and predict development of activity limitation in those with normal HAQ-II scores at baseline. ? 2018, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).",Activity limitation; Comorbidities; Gout; Pain,"urate; adult; Article; bone erosion; bone radiography; female; follow up; gout; Health Assessment Questionnaire; human; limited mobility; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; pain assessment; predictor variable; priority journal; prospective study; uric acid blood level; visual analog scale; body mass; complication; daily life activity; disability; gout; health survey; middle aged; New Zealand; severity of illness index; Activities of Daily Living; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disability Evaluation; Female; Gout; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index",2-s2.0-85045762332

The majority of the forensic inpatients believed that their views were valued in their care and treatment. Most felt physically and emotionally safe at the hospital and believed that staff knew how to support them in times of distress. The majority felt that their culture and spirituality were respected. However, some areas for improvement were also noted, such as regarding staff attitudes.

Understanding local costs and factors that affect them is important for planning of trauma services and obtaining funding for quality improvement projects. The aim of this study was to assess actual costs and influencing factors in patients treated for major trauma in Northland, New Zealand. METHODS: Adult patients admitted to Whangarei Hospital suffering from major trauma for three years from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2017 were identified from the hospital’s prospectively maintained trauma database. Major trauma was defined as an Injury Severity Score (ISS)>12, admission to intensive care or death secondary to trauma. Patients >50 years old with isolated neck of femur fractures, hangings, poisonings and drownings were excluded. Immediate or early (<24hours) transfers to tertiary hospitals were excluded from costing analysis. Actual costs were calculated using in-house, patient-level costing utilising CostPro software. Case-weight costs, based on DRG codes used nationally, were also calculated using standard techniques. Factors affecting costs were analysed. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixty-one patients suffering from major trauma were identified, 62 patients were transferred early leaving 199 patients for analysis. The mean ISS was 18 (IQR=14–22) and average length of stay was 8.5 days. Fifty-one percent of the cohort required intensive care and 36% underwent operative intervention in Whangarei Hospital. Total actual cost was NZ$4,614,652 with an average cost of NZ$23,189 per patient. There was a significant difference in actual vs case-weight cost for the patients in the ISS 13–24 group who formed the bulk of the cohort. There was also extremely significant difference between the costs for patients requiring either intensive care or operative intervention versus those who did not (p=0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study in New Zealand describing actual costs in patients suffering from major trauma and variation to case-weight costs. Intensive care admission and operative intervention have been identified as the two main drivers of cost. Further studies are needed in New Zealand, particularly in major trauma centres, to better understand the true cost of major trauma within the country. ?

METHOD: The quality improvement project included multidisciplinary collaboration between maternity clinicians and clinical coders, substantive redesign of the Waitemata DHB’s birth documentation form, systematic auditing and follow-up of clinical documentation by a dedicated quality midwife, linking of maternity clinicians to a key designated senior coder and ongoing PPH incidence monitoring and staff education. RESULTS: The coded rate of PPH has risen dramatically and is now in line with expected Australasian incidence levels. A corresponding increase in the value of cost-weighted discharges (estimated at $544,000 for the 2015/16 financial year) was realised as a result of the more accurate reported incidence. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates the value of coding to a clinical service and the importance of clinical leadership and engagement in achieving successful and sustainable service redesign initiatives. It provides an example of how to evaluate and update coding and a process for changing the way clinicians and coders work that could benefit other services in Waitemata DHB as well as in other New Zealand district health boards. ?

Two studies were undertaken to evaluate data-logging use. Methods: Study 1: a 27-question web-based survey was developed in consultation with hearing aid manufacturers and distributors, and sent to 358 members of the New Zealand Audiological Society (NZAS). Study 2: data-logging results and hearing aid features from 44 clients were related to the Modified Abbreviated Profile of Hearing Aid Benefit (MAPHAB). Results: Study 1 had 108 respondents to the survey (30% response rate); 88% of audiologists found data-logging to be a useful clinical tool in the overall hearing aid fitting process and 94% found it to be a useful tool in participant counselling. Most audiologists reported data-logging use in the first follow-up appointment and often (but not always) in subsequent appointments. Study 2 found data-logging agreed with self-reported patterns of use. The participants found significant benefit in hearing aids according to the MAPHAB, but data-logging results provided little insight into MAPHAB outcomes. Participants used hearing aids for over 8 h per day, with aids in ‘speech-in-quiet’ modes 67% of the time. Clients fitted to the NAL-NL2 prescription had greater benefit than those fitted to NAL-NL1. The trial audiologists seldom used data-logging to assist fitting. Conclusions: Audiologists self-reported that data-logging was a useful clinical tool for assisting in the hearing aid fitting process, however in practice audiologists did not appear to be using many of the data-logging features. ? 2017, ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Datalogging; hearing aids; outcomes; technology,,2-s2.0-85021077102

The aim of this study was to identify common factors and gain a better understanding of late-life suicide in Asian people living in New Zealand. Methods: New Zealand Coronial Services provided records of all closed cases of late-life suicides (age ? 65 years) between July 2007 and December 2012. Out of the total of 225 cases, 15 were recorded as being of Asian ethnicity. These cases were reviewed in their entirety using a qualitative thematic analysis approach. Results: Eight Asian men and seven Asian women completed suicide during this period. The majority (93%) lived with their families, and 80% were found by family after having completed suicide at home. Three main themes emerged from the thematic analysis: (i) suicide occurring in the context of a family; (ii) declining physical health; and (iii) a violent method of suicide. The role of the family has not been previously identified in other studies of late-life suicide in New Zealand. Conclusions: Further research is needed to identify ways Asian families can access culturally appropriate and accessible support and mental health services for their older members at risk of suicide.

This increased use can include over-medicalisation, or over-treatment with interventions designed to cure that are likely futile in people who are dying. This is an issue with medical, ethical, and financial dimensions, and has implications for health policy, funding and the structure of care delivery. We measured the annual use of nine pre-defined public healthcare services between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2012 by elderly New Zealanders (65–99 years old) in their last year of life and compared it with that of the cohort of elderly New Zealanders who used healthcare in the period but did not die. We used linked, encrypted unique patient identifiers to reorganise and filter records in routinely collected national healthcare utilisation and mortality administrative datasets. We found that, in New Zealand, people do seem to use more of most health services in their last year of life than those of the same age who are not in their last year of life.

Bio-photonic imaging provides an opportunity to reduce use of animals in infection modelling and refine the information that can be obtained, however the range of bioluminescent GAS strains available is limited. In this study we set out to develop bioluminescent iGAS strains for use in in vivo pneumonia and soft tissue disease models. Results: Using clinical emm1, emm3, and emm89 GAS strains that were transformed with constructs carrying the luxABCDE operon, growth and bioluminescence of transformed strains were characterised in vitro and in vivo. Emm3 and emm89 strains expressed detectable bioluminescence when transformed with a replicating plasmid and light production correlated with viable bacterial counts in vitro, however plasmid instability precluded use in the absence of antimicrobial pressure. Emm89 GAS transformed with an integrating construct demonstrated stable bioluminescence that was maintained in the absence of antibiotics. Bioluminescence of the emm89 strain correlated with viable bacterial counts both in vitro and immediately following infection in vivo. Although bioluminescence conferred a detectable fitness burden to the emm89 strain during soft tissue infection in vivo, it did not prevent dissemination to distant tissues. Conclusion: Development of stably bioluminescent GAS for use in vitro and in vivo models of infection should facilitate development of novel therapeutics and vaccines while also increasing our understanding of infection progression and transmission routes. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Bioluminescence; Biophotonic imaging; Group A Streptococcus; Infection model; Invasive disease; Luciferase; Streptococcus pyogenes,"animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterial count; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium isolate; bioluminescence; controlled study; disease model; emm1 gene; emm3 gene; emm89 gene; female; gene expression; group A streptococcal infection; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; operon; pathogenesis; plasmid; soft tissue infection; Streptococcus group A; animal; disease model; genetics; human; luminescence; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; reproductive fitness; respiratory tract infection; Streptococcus infection; Streptococcus pyogenes; bacterial antigen; carrier protein; outer membrane protein; photoprotein; streptococcal M protein; Animals; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Carrier Proteins; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Genetic Fitness; Humans; Luminescent Measurements; Luminescent Proteins; Mice; Operon; Respiratory Tract Infections; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes",2-s2.0-85048779507

This study explored the extent to which learning opportunities existed and were utilised within paediatric team handovers in New Zealand secondary hospitals. METHODS: We undertook a qualitative, two-site case study within two paediatric departments in 2014 and 2015, and interviewed 29 participants, including medical students, junior doctors and consultants. We conducted a thematic analysis using a general inductive approach. RESULTS: Participants’ narratives revealed that safe transfer of pertinent patient information between clinicians was the primary function of team handover. They described learning as an additional key component. Most learning opportunities were reported to be informal and opportunistic, related to the specific patients whose care was discussed within each handover. Handover team members indicated that implicit learning occurred as a feature of their handover experience. CONCLUSIONS: Learning opportunities exist within team handovers and the associated learning frequently occurs either opportunistically or implicitly. Adoption of a reflective approach to learning opportunities is likely to result in improved educational experiences for handover participants, particularly medical students and junior doctors. Handover represents a clinical event within which valuable workplace learning occurs. ?

Antipsychotic agents are frequently the medications prescribed as involuntary treatment. Typical and atypical antipsychotic agents are often used in both emergent and nonemergent situations during pregnancy. Despite a lack of randomized, double-blind, controlled, prospective studies in pregnancy, available data regarding the safety of antipsychotic agents in pregnancy are relatively reassuring. At the same time, the risks of untreated psychosis, for both the mother and the fetus, are not negligible. Such cases merit ethics-related and legal analyses.

Genetic variation can modify an individual's susceptibility to these environmental challenges. These gene by environment interactions are important, but difficult, to dissect. The nucleus is the primary organelle where environmental responses impact directly on the genetic variants within the genome, resulting in changes to the biology of the genome and ultimately the phenotype. Understanding genome biology requires the integration of the linear DNA sequence, epigenetic modifications and nuclear proteins that are present within the nucleus.

We aimed to determine the extent to which: (i) childhood mental health is associated with functional and structural cardiovascular risk phenotypes and adiposity in late childhood/adolescence, and (ii) associations between mental health and cardiovascular phenotypes may be explained by differential body mass index. Methods: This cross-sectional study drew on three longitudinal community-based cohort studies (two enriched for overweight/obesity) in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia, with harmonized follow-up in 2014. Mental health exposures included emotional and behavioural problems (Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire) and psychosocial health and general well-being (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL)), which were assessed by self- and parent-proxy report. Cardiovascular risk phenotypes and adiposity measures included mean arterial pressure, pulse wave velocity, carotid artery intima-media thickness, retinal arterioleto-venule ratio, waist circumference, % body fat, and BMI z-score. We used multivariable linear regression models, adjusting for age, sex and neighbourhood disadvantage, to examine associations. Results: Of the 364 participants (mean age 14.7, standard deviation 2.0, years), 30% were overweight and 16% obese. All adiposity indicators were positively associated with higher behavioural/emotional problems and poorer psychosocial health and negatively associated with better ratings of positive general well-being, as reported by parents and children (all P ? 0.03). However, there was little evidence that cardiovascular functional or structural phenotypes varied by mental health. Conclusions: By late childhood/adolescence, mental health is strongly associated with adiposity but not with cardiovascular structure or function. This suggests that the known relationship between these constructs may not develop until early or mid-adulthood. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",adolescent; cardiovascular diseases; cardiovascular system; child; mental health; obesity,adolescent; adolescent obesity; adult; arterial wall thickness; Article; Australia; behavior assessment; body fat; body mass; cardiovascular function; cardiovascular risk; carotid artery; child; childhood obesity; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; disease association; emotional disorder; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; mental disease; mental health; Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; phenotype; problem behavior; pulse wave; self report; social psychology; Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire; waist circumference; wellbeing; cardiovascular disease; mental health; obesity; phenotype; Victoria; Adiposity; Adolescent; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Obesity; Phenotype; Self Report; Victoria,2-s2.0-85047643643

It is unclear whether thyrotoxicosis results in anaemia in the absence of other causes. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and characteristics of anaemia in patients with thyrotoxicosis. Design: A prospective cohort study of patients with thyrotoxicosis. Patients: 353 patients referred to a regional endocrinology centre in New Zealand from March 2013 to November 2014 for new-onset thyrotoxicosis. Measurements: Detailed assessment including thyroid function tests, full blood count, inflammatory markers, haematological parameters and coeliac serology. Anaemia was defined as a haemoglobin value <115?g/L (woman) or <130?g/L (men). Results: Anaemia was present in 31 (8.7%) patients at diagnosis. Of these, pre-existing anaemia was present in 10, and a further 11 had one or more identifiable underlying cause(s) for the anaemia. Only 10 patients (2.8% of the entire cohort) had anaemia not clearly attributable to another cause. Median free thyroid hormone levels were higher in those with anaemia of unknown cause compared to patients with thyrotoxicosis alone. The median duration of anaemia was shorter in patients with thyrotoxicosis-associated anaemia compared to those with anaemia due to an underlying cause (1 vs 6?months, P?=.001). In all patients with thyrotoxicosis-associated anaemia, the anaemia resolved, either prior to, or on becoming euthyroid. Conclusion: Anaemia coexisting with thyrotoxicosis is less common than previously reported and is mild and transient. Patients with thyrotoxicosis and significant anaemia should be investigated for other potential causes, particularly when anaemia persists. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",anaemia; Graves’ disease; haemoglobin; hyperthyroidism; thyroid function tests; thyroid hormones; thyrotoxicosis,ferritin; hemoglobin; thyroid hormone; thyrotropin; hemoglobin; adult; age; age distribution; anemia; Article; blood cell count; cell volume; cohort analysis; controlled study; cyanocobalamin deficiency; disease association; female; Graves disease; hematological parameters; hemoglobin blood level; human; major clinical study; male; mean corpuscular volume; microcytosis; middle aged; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; thyroid function test; thyrotoxicosis; aged; anemia; Graves disease; metabolism; thyrotoxicosis; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anemia; Female; Graves Disease; Hemoglobins; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Thyrotoxicosis; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85045298522

Several settings have been proposed as venues for this procedure, however it is increasingly being performed in theatre under a general anaesthetic (GA). General anaesthesia, however, is expensive and not without risks. The purpose of the present study was to compare results of outpatient releases to theatre releases, and assess current practising trends among orthopaedic surgeons. METHODS: Retrospective comparison of patients with idiopathic clubfoot managed by Ponseti method who had Achilles tenotomy performed in outpatient clinic and in theatre. Surveys were sent to all POSNZ members to determine current practising trends in New Zealand. Parental satisfaction surveys were performed. Comparative cost analysis was performed using hospital billing information. RESULTS: The current study includes 64 idiopathic congenital clubfeet (19 bilateral cases). PAT was performed on 26 clubfeet under local anaesthetic in an outpatient setting, and 33 clubfeet under GA in a theatre setting. There was no significant difference for post-operative complications, or recurrence (p=0.67). Those in theatre group were exposed to a greater number of general anaesthetics before the age of four. Among practising New Zealand paediatric orthopaedic surgeons, 77.78% perform this in theatre under general anaesthesia, while only 22.22% perform PAT in outpatient clinic. The main barriers included concerns regarding pain control, concerns regarding incomplete release, concerns regarding distress to family and concerns regarding sterility. Parental satisfaction surveys found pain management to be excellent. Financial data was analysed and indicative costs were $6,061 NZD per procedure in theatre, compared to $378 NZD per procedure in clinic. CONCLUSION: PAT performed in a clinic setting is both safe and efficacious with results comparative to that performed in theatre.

We compared high school students who use high amounts of substances to students with lower levels (or nil) of use across health and well-being indicators to explore the feasibility of this kind of categorization. Based on survey questions from Youth'12, a cross-sectional adolescent health survey involving 3% (8,500) of New Zealand high school students, we selected criteria indicative of substance use that would warrant specialist alcohol and other drugs (AOD) treatment. Two sets of “high-use” criteria (e.g., drinking “alcohol most days a week or more”) for both older and younger adolescents were selected. Eleven percent of students met criteria for “high use,” with higher rates in males and older students. Rates of high use were similar across high-, medium- and low-deprivation neighborhoods. Binge alcohol use (9.2%) was the predominant form of “high use.” Students with “high use” reported poorer health outcomes across numerous areas including mental health, physical health, risk behaviors, and access to health care. Only 5% of “high-use” students had accessed an AOD service. The wide range of negative health outcomes associated with a high level of substance use suggests that brief screening focusing on the level of substance use may help in identifying young people at risk. Simple and brief processes may improve the uptake and implementation of screening in primary care and other settings, and further research in this area is recommended. ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",adolescent; comorbidity; health; screening; substance-related disorders,,2-s2.0-85044256162

Methods: Wh?nau Pakari trial participants were recruited January 2012–August 2014, and randomised to either a high-intensity intervention (weekly sessions for 12 months with home-based assessments and advice, n = 100) or low-intensity control (home-based assessments and advice only, n = 99). Trial participants were aged 5–16 years, resided in Taranaki, Aotearoa/New Zealand (NZ), with a body mass index (BMI) ?98th centile or BMI >91st centile with weight-related comorbidities. Conventional group participants (receiving paediatrician assessment with dietitian input and physical activity/nutrition support, n = 44) were aged 4–15 years, and resided in the same or another NZ centre. The change in BMI standard deviation score (SDS) at 12 months from baseline and programme intervention costs, both at the participant level, were used for the economic evaluation. A limited health funder perspective with costs in 2016 NZ$ was taken. Results: The per child 12-month Wh?nau Pakari programme costs were significantly lower than in the conventional group. In the low-intensity group, costs were NZ$939 (95% CI: 872, 1007) (US$648) lower than the conventional group. In the high-intensity intervention group, costs were NZ$155 (95% CI: 89, 219) (US$107) lower than in the conventional group. BMI SDS reductions were similar in the three groups. Conclusions: A home-based, multi-disciplinary child obesity intervention had lower programme costs per child, greater reach, with similar BMI SDS outcomes at 12 months when compared with the previous hospital-based conventional model. ? 2018 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity",Adolescent; Economic evaluation; Lifestyle intervention; Obesity; Paediatric,adolescent; adolescent obesity; Article; body mass; child; childhood obesity; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; community program; comorbidity; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; dietitian; economic evaluation; exercise intensity; female; health care cost; healthy lifestyle; home care; hospital care; human; interdisciplinary research; intervention study; kinesiotherapy; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; New Zealander; nutritional support; pediatrician; physical activity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; self esteem; behavior therapy; child health care; childhood obesity; cost benefit analysis; economics; follow up; health promotion; interdisciplinary communication; procedures; program evaluation; Adolescent; Adolescent Health Services; Behavior Therapy; Child; Child Health Services; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Promotion; Humans; Interdisciplinary Communication; Male; New Zealand; Pediatric Obesity; Program Evaluation,2-s2.0-85047183029

Methodology: This retrospective study assessed all pediatric surgical procedures performed within a secondary center in New Zealand between May 2014 and May 2016. The days between the date of surgery booking on the waiting list and actual date of surgery were calculated and compared to their corresponding elective surgery waiting target times set by the New Zealand Ministry of Health (MoH). Patient demographic data were collated to then identify any discrepancy between ethnic groups. Results: A total of 203 pediatric surgical procedures were performed on 193 patients. Of the 194 (95%) procedures that were included in the study, 30 breached a maximum waiting time. Though this represented a small proportion of patients, M?ori were significantly over represented in this group. Conclusion: The majority of our patients with delayed elective surgery were of M?ori ethnicity, for reasons not entirely accounted for by common socioeconomic determinants of health. Our study suggests the possibility of innate systemic causes not detected by standard models of health. However, further research with larger cohorts is needed.

This has driven a demand for new strategies to decrease patient waiting time and administrative costs. The aim of this study was to determine if a purpose-built See and Treat skin cancer clinic could provide a faster skin cancer treatment pathway with comparable clinical outcomes and acceptability to patients. Methods: This was a prospective observational study of patients treated through the See and Treat clinic with a retrospective control cohort. The prospective ‘See and Treat’ cohort included a consecutive series of 106 patients, while the retrospective cohort included a consecutive series of 200 patients. Patient demographics, time from referral to surgery and operative measures were analysed. One hundred patients in the prospective cohort completed an anonymous satisfaction survey regarding their treatment. Results: The average time from referral to surgery was reduced from 121 days in the retrospective cohort to 60 days in the See and Treat cohort (P < 0.001). Rates of complete excision of malignant and premalignant lesions were not different between the two groups, being 93% (178/191) and 91% (76/84), respectively (P = 0.609). Ninety-five percent (95/100) of patients were satisfied with their See and Treat experience overall. Conclusion: We show that a considerable reduction in the time between referral and surgery can be achieved through a See and Treat clinic without compromise of the success of surgical treatment. Moreover, such a treatment pathway has been shown to be acceptable, and largely preferable, to patients. ? 2017 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons",basal cell carcinoma; dermatologic surgical procedures; melanoma; See and Treat surgery; skin neoplasms; squamous cell carcinoma; waiting lists,"adult; aged; ambulatory surgery; Australia; basal cell carcinoma; chi square distribution; clinical pathway; female; hospital admission; human; male; middle aged; organization and management; outcome assessment; outpatient department; pathology; patient referral; procedures; prospective study; retrospective study; skin tumor; squamous cell carcinoma; statistics and numerical data; time to treatment; Adult; Aged; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Ambulatory Surgical Procedures; Australia; Carcinoma, Basal Cell; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Chi-Square Distribution; Critical Pathways; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Prospective Studies; Referral and Consultation; Retrospective Studies; Skin Neoplasms; Time-to-Treatment; Waiting Lists",2-s2.0-85031098688

This study sought to determine the directions of wound closure that would result in least wound tension after skin lesion excisions. MATERIALS AND METHODS Some 1181 consecutive skin lesion excisions were investigated (age range 13-95 years, median 64 years) using a tensiometer to determine directions of least wound tension. These lines were mapped. Skin tension measurements were taken during the procedure and analysed. The clear majority of excisions were for skin cancer and the others were for cysts or dysplastic naevi. Lesions such as lipomas, which entail incisional rather than excisional surgery (i.e. where overlying skin was not excised) were excluded. All lesions were cut out in a circular fashion following tension measurements. Closure was undertaken in the direction of least tension (biodynamic excisional skin tension line) and this was illustrated. This process was repeated in all cases where body site and direction of closure was mapped. Statistical analyses were undertaken on a series on the scalp and lower limb. RESULTS Biodynamic excisional skin tension lines have a clear directional preference: scalp-coronal direction, limbs--vertical orientation of ellipses and trunk - mostly horizontal except oblique at the shoulder and scapular regions. DISCUSSION Skin cancer excisions often end up with poor cosmetic results, owing to inconsistency in identifying the correct excisional wound closure lines. This has not been helped by the (hitherto) lack of large in vivo biomechanical studies, and because incisional lines and excisional lines have not been considered separately in surgical practice. Orientating ellipses or wound closures using biodynamic excisional skin tension lines offers a guide to reducing wound tension and minimising wound complications or scarring after cutaneous surgery. ? 2017 Royal College of Surgeons of England.",Excision; Langer's lines; Skin; Skin cancer; Skin tension,"adolescent; adult; aged; anatomy and histology; biophysics; dysplastic nevus; epidermoid cyst; functions of the skin and its appendages; human; middle aged; procedures; scar; skin; skin surgery; skin tumor; surface tension; very elderly; wound closure; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biophysical Phenomena; Cicatrix; Dermatologic Surgical Procedures; Dysplastic Nevus Syndrome; Epidermal Cyst; Humans; Middle Aged; Skin; Skin Neoplasms; Skin Physiological Phenomena; Surface Tension; Wound Closure Techniques; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85044504784

Altered regulation of metals, particularly pan-cerebral copper deficiency, and more regionally-localized perturbation of other metals, are prominent in AD brain although data on how these CNS perturbations are reflected in the peripheral bloodstream are inconsistent to date. To assess the potential use of metal dysregulation to generate biomarkers in AD, we performed a case–control study of seven essential metals and selenium, measured by inductively coupled plasma mass-spectrometry, in samples from AD and matched control cases. Metals were sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, and copper. In the whole study-group and in female participants, plasma metal levels did not differ between cases and controls. In males by contrast, there was moderate evidence that zinc levels trended towards increase in AD [10.8 (10.2–11.5)]??mol/L, mean (± 95% CI; P = 0.021) compared with controls [10.2 (9.6–10.4)]. Thus alterations in plasma zinc levels differed between genders in AD. In correlational analysis, there was evidence for an increased number of ‘strong’ metal co-regulations in AD cases and differential co-modulations of metal pairs: copper-sodium (R control = ? 0.03, R AD = 0.65; P = 0.009), and copper-calcium (R control = ? 0.01, R AD = 0.65; P = 0.01) were significant in AD males, potentially consistent with reported evidence for dysregulation of copper in severely damaged brain regions in AD. In conclusion, our data suggest that the measurement of metals co-regulation in plasma may provide a useful representation of those metal perturbations taking place in the AD brain and therefore might be useful as plasma-based biomarkers. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Alzheimer’s disease; Dementia; Human plasma; Metal biomarker; Neurodegeneration; Plasma-zinc levels,biological marker; calcium; copper; iron; magnesium; metal; potassium; selenium; sodium; zinc; biological marker; calcium; copper; iron; magnesium; metal; potassium; selenium; sodium; zinc; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; calcium blood level; case control study; controlled study; copper blood level; correlation analysis; female; heavy metal blood level; human; iron blood level; magnesium blood level; major clinical study; male; potassium blood level; selenium blood level; sex difference; sodium blood level; trace metal blood level; zinc blood level; Alzheimer disease; blood; dementia; sexual characteristics; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Calcium; Copper; Dementia; Female; Humans; Iron; Magnesium; Male; Metals; Potassium; Selenium; Sex Characteristics; Sodium; Zinc,2-s2.0-85042928745

Methods: Adult injury patients presenting to Auckland City Hospital ED within 6 h of injury were invited to participate during three recruitment periods (2015–2016). An interviewer-administered questionnaire obtained information on demographic, injury, general health, and lifestyle factors. Breath alcohol samples were obtained. Descriptive and logistic regression analyses were conducted. Results: 501 patients participated (71% response rate), 21% had consumed alcohol within 6 h of their injury. The majority were male, and overall falls were the most common mechanism of injury among all patients. Alcohol-related injuries most commonly occurred at home, and were significantly more likely to occur during the weekend (Friday-Sunday) and night hours (23:00–06:59). After controlling for the effects of confounding; ‘poor’ general health, engaging in leisure activities at the time of injury, and injuries resulting from assaults were associated with increasing the odds of alcohol-related injury. Conclusions: Acute alcohol use continues to play a considerable role in ED injury presentations in NZ.

The abstract is reproduced below. Abstract As a highly valued resource that was translocated between Pacific Islands in prehistory, pigs potentially inform on human-animal interactions in a unique way. We consider evidence for variability in the diet and health of domestic Polynesian pigs, and the potential for inter-specific competition and extirpation. We analyze dental pathologies and developmental defects in pig dentition from the small (18 km2) almost-atoll of Aitutaki, Cook Islands (East Polynesia). The study assemblage (n = 54) derives from multiple sites dating between 1250 CE and European contact. We examine enamel hypoplasia (EH) as an indicator of general and periodic physiological stresses during enamel development, and the occurrence of calculus and caries as indicators of diet. We test the hypothesis that the combination of growing human populations and the constraints of life on small islands resulted in deteriorating living conditions for domesticates over time. Results from three time periods demonstrate that Aitutaki's pigs were free of caries and dental calculus, indicating relative stability in dietary carbohydrates. Rates of enamel hypoplasia (EH), lines and pits, were modest (26.3% total). Defect locations on the crowns suggest stressors likely reflecting life events, e.g. gestation, birth, weaning, which may have become more acute over time. The moderate rates of EH are consistent with results from domesticated (versus wild) populations from European and Asian localities. However, the Aitutaki pigs contrast with Nuku Hiva, Marquesas Islands (Polynesia) populations, where caries and calculus levels were initially similar but markedly increased over time, as did the frequency of EH. Overall, the results indicate that Aitutaki's pigs experienced moderate levels of nutritional and/or physiological stress, which increased slightly in late prehistory but were not nearly as marked as anticipated for this small island. These results demonstrate the value of dental analysis beyond the wild-domesticated transition, and the potential for new insights into prehistoric Pacific husbandry practices. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,,2-s2.0-85042152552

Identifying critical performance variables provides a mechanism by which funders can understand what they are purchasing without getting caught up in restrictive service specifications that restrict the ability of service providers to meet the needs of the clients. An implementation pathway and benchmarking programme called IN TOUCH provided contracted providers of home support and funders with a consistent methodology to follow when developing and implementing new restorative approaches for service delivery. Data from performance measurement was used to triangulate the personal and social worlds of the stakeholders enabling them to develop a shared understanding of what is working and what is not. The initial implementation of IN TOUCH involved five District Health Boards. The recursive dialogue encouraged by the IN TOUCH programme supports better and more sustainable service development because performance management is anchored to agreed data that has meaning to all stakeholders. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd,Balanced scorecard; Benchmarking; Home support; Implementation; Older people; Performance management; Performance measurement; Reablement; Restorative home support,"benchmarking; elderly care; elderly population; health care; policy implementation; service provision; service quality; stakeholder; benchmarking; human; public health; touch; benchmarking; community care; health care personnel; home care; independent living; New Zealand; organization; procedures; public relations; quality of life; questionnaire; stakeholder engagement; standards; theoretical model; total quality management; Benchmarking; Community Health Services; Health Personnel; Home Care Services; Humans; Independent Living; Interinstitutional Relations; Interprofessional Relations; Models, Theoretical; New Zealand; Organizational Innovation; Quality Improvement; Quality of Life; Stakeholder Participation; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85039729062

The New Zealand Environmental Protection Authority (NZEPA) rejected this and commissioned a new report, concluding that glyphosate was unlikely to be genotoxic or carcinogenic to humans. The NZEPA has argued that the difference arose because IARC is a “hazard-identification authority”, whereas NZEPA is a “regulatory body that needs to cast the net more widely”. We conclude that the NZEPA process for evaluating the carcinogenicity of glyphosate was flawed and the post hoc justification invalid: there is no mention of risk assessment or “net-benefit approach” in the NZEPA report; and there is no discussion of current New Zealand glyphosate exposures. Further, the NZEPA report quotes heavily from the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) report, which is itself markedly flawed, and like the NZEPA report, relies heavily on industry-funded and industry-manipulated reviews. Given the scientific flaws in both reports we urge that: the NZEPA report be withdrawn; the NZEPA respond to the concerns raised and for a reassessment to be conducted; and clearer process and better understanding of science be used to inform any future review of hazardous substances in New Zealand. ?

After ESS, patients often require ongoing topical and systemic medication. To reduce the incidence of immediate and delayed post-surgical complications, a variety of temporary post-operative nasal interventions are currently used. However, newly developed intranasal drug delivery devices can enhance tissue recovery after ESS by releasing therapeutic drugs locally, while providing structural support to reduce tissue adhesion and scaring. Intranasal drug delivery devices are promising next generation post-surgery devices, offering advantages for enhancing tissue recovery through release of loaded therapeutic drugs locally in a controlled manner over the required time-frame during post-operative healing. The mechanisms and effectiveness of these drug delivery systems initiate a new era in providing topical controlled drug delivery to the sinus tissue and can be a guide for the future development of specific effective therapies of preparations with other drugs that otherwise should be administered parenterally. Hence, further research is required to validate their efficacy. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Chronic rhinosinusitis; drug delivery; endoscopic sinus surgery; intranasal drug delivery; post-operative care,"analgesic agent; antibiotic agent; antihistaminic agent; chitosan; corticosteroid; cyclodextrin; decongestive agent; drug; macrolide; mucolytic agent; nose drops; polyvinyl alcohol sponge; prodrug; sodium chloride; steroid; vaccine; drug; acute rhinosinusitis; aerosol; chronic rhinosinusitis; ciliary motility; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug delivery system; drug distribution; drug formulation; drug packaging; drug solubility; endoscopic sinus surgery; enzymatic degradation; human; nose; olfactory mucosa; postoperative care; postoperative complication; priority journal; promoter region; respiratory system; Review; rhinosinusitis; systemic therapy; vestibule; wound healing; animal; endoscopy; intranasal drug administration; procedures; sinusitis; Administration, Intranasal; Animals; Drug Delivery Systems; Endoscopy; Humans; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Sinusitis",2-s2.0-85032785215

METHODS: Auckland City Hospital patient data was extracted from the Australia and New Zealand ACS ‘SNAPSHOT’ audit, performed over 14 days in May 2012. RESULTS: There were 121 suspected ACS admissions to Auckland City hospital during the audit period, with 45 (37%) patients directly managed by the cardiology service, and 76 (63%) patients cared for by non-cardiology services. Based on the subsequent discharge diagnosis, the cardiology service had more patients with definite ACS than the non-cardiology services; 27/45 (60%) compared to 16/76 (21%), difference (95%CI) 39% (22–56), P<0.0001).

CONCLUSIONS: In patients with a discharge diagnosis of definite ACS, those managed by non-cardiology services were less likely to receive guideline-recommended investigations, and management, in this relatively small cohort study.

Takotsubo syndrome (TS) mimics MI, but is thought to have a distinct aetiology and may exhibit a reversed pattern of seasonal variation. This study investigated the seasonal variation in the incidence of TS in comparison to MI. METHODS: Two hundred and sixty consecutive patients with TS (95% women, median age 66 years) admitted between March 2004 and December 2016 in the Auckland region of New Zealand were identified. The study population was grouped into three-month intervals (seasons) according to the date of admission to analyse for potential seasonal variations in the incidence. The TS cohort was compared with 36,376 patients who presented with acute MI in the Auckland region (40% women, median age 71 years) between March 2004 and December 2016. RESULTS: The onset of TS differed as a function of season (p=0.02), with the events most frequent in summer (n=77, 30%) and least so in winter (n=46, 18%). In contrast, incidence of MI also varied by season (p=0.0003), with highest events in winter and lowest in summer. CONCLUSION: The pattern of seasonal variation in TS is reversed compared with MI, with peaks during summer. ?

Researchers have identified backward walking ""BW"" strengthens ankle dorsi-flexors and could be a useful activity for foot drop rehabilitation. During BW, angular changes at foot occur in reverse order to FW. However, stimulators would stimulate inappropriately if the user steps backward. This paper introduces an approach for bidirectional walk (FW and BW) detection that can augment functionality of stimulators for both directions. The proposed approach utilises an algorithm to evaluate antero-posterior acceleration out of a foot-worn accelerometer for temporal dominance of acceleration trends during swing phase. As a feasibility study, the approach is validated under normal and simulated unilateral foot drop styles at slow, normal, and fast speeded FW and BW by 16 healthy walkers. To study the effects of speed and style on detection accuracy, the success rates per participant and across conditions were examined using repeated measures ANOVA and post-hoc analysis using Tukey's HSD at (p<0.05). Overall the detection accuracy is found above 90% with both styles and directions in majority of participants. The outcomes infer the proposed research can be promising for developing a stimulator that can be used in clinical settings for rehabilitation alongside gait support under communal settings. ? 2017 IEEE.",Acceleration; Back Stepping; Bidirectional Walk; Foot Drop; Functional Electrical Stimulator; Gait; Wearables,Acceleration; Clinical research; Walking aids; Bidirectional Walk; Foot drop; Functional electrical stimulators; Gait; Wearables; Drops,2-s2.0-85047855006

Hospitalisation with an infectious disease is a recurrent event for some children. Our objective was to describe risk factors for infectious disease readmission following hospital admission with an infectious disease in the first two years of life. Methods: We performed a national cohort study of New Zealand children, born 2005-2009, with an infectious disease admission before age 24 months. Children readmitted with an infectious disease within 12 months of the first infectious disease admission were identified. Every infectious disease admission was categorised as a respiratory, enteric, skin and soft tissue, urinary or other infection. Independent associations of demographic and child health factors with infectious disease readmission were determined using multiple variable logistic regression. Results: From 2005 to 2011, there were 69,902 infectious disease admissions for 46,657 children less than two years old. Of these 46,657 children, 10,205 (22%) had at least one infectious disease readmission within 12 months of their first admission. The first infectious disease admission was respiratory (54%), enteric (15%), skin or soft tissue (7%), urinary (4%) or other (20%). Risk of infectious disease readmission was increased if the first infectious disease admission was respiratory (OR = 1.87, 95% CI 1.78-1.95) but not if it was in any other infectious disease category. Risk factors for respiratory infectious disease readmission were male gender, Pacific or Maori ethnicity, greater household deprivation, presence of a complex chronic condition, or a first respiratory infectious disease admission during autumn or of ?3 days duration. Fewer factors (younger age, male gender, presence of a complex chronic condition) were associated with enteric infection readmission. The presence of a complex chronic condition was the only factor associated with urinary tract infection readmission and none of the factors were associated with skin or soft tissue infection readmission. Conclusions: In children less than two years old, infectious disease readmission risk is increased if the first infectious disease admission is a respiratory infectious disease but not if it is another infectious disease category. Risk factors for respiratory infectious disease readmission are different from those for other infectious disease readmissions. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Child preschool; Cohort studies; Diarrhea; Hospitalization; Infant; Patient readmission; Respiratory tract infections; Skin and soft tissue infections; Urinary tract infections,"Article; child; childhood disease; chronic disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; ethnicity; female; gender; hospital readmission; human; infection; intestine infection; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); New Zealand; Pacific Islander; preschool child; respiratory tract infection; risk factor; skin infection; soft tissue infection; urinary tract infection; acute disease; hospital readmission; infant; infection; newborn; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Acute Disease; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infection; Logistic Models; Male; New Zealand; Patient Readmission; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85043323220

There is a growing body of literature recognising the negative emotional impact that caring for children with cancer and blood disorders can have on health professionals. Currently there is an emerging interest in a more strengths-based approach focused on maintaining staff wellbeing. Resilience has been suggested as a framework for coping and maintaining wellbeing in areas, like children’s oncology and has been used as a term to describe the ‘surviving’ health professional.

Following a 4-week trial preferences were reassessed and the users preferred programme was compared to the automatic classifier for sound quality and hearing in noise (HINT test) using a 12 loudspeaker array. Study sample: Twenty-five participants with symmetrical moderate-severe sensorineural hearing loss. Results: Participant preferences of manual programme for scenarios varied considerably between and within sessions. A HINT Speech Reception Threshold (SRT) advantage was observed for the automatic classifier over participant’s manual selection for speech in quiet, loud noise and car noise.

Preserving nerve integrity, to prevent progressive nerve damage, remains a clinical challenge. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are implicated in the development and maintenance of healthy nerves and may be beneficial for promoting peripheral nerve health. The aim of this systematic review is to assess the effects of oral omega-3 PUFA supplementation on peripheral nerve integrity, including both subjective and objective measures of peripheral nerve structure and/or function. Methods and analysis A systematic review of randomised controlled trials that have evaluated the effects of omega-3 PUFA supplementation on peripheral nerve assessments will be conducted. Comprehensive electronic database searches will be performed in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), US National Institutes of Health Clinical Trials Registry and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. The title, abstract and keywords of identified articles will be assessed for eligibility by two reviewers. Full-text articles will be obtained for all studies judged as eligible or potentially eligible; these studies will be independently assessed by two reviewers to determine eligibility. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus. Risk of bias assessment will be performed using the Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool to appraise the quality of included studies. If clinically meaningful, and there are a sufficient number of eligible studies, a meta-analysis will be conducted and a summary of findings table will be provided. Ethics and dissemination This is a systematic review that will involve the analysis of previously published data, and therefore ethics approval is not required. A manuscript reporting the results of this systematic review will be published in a peer-reviewed journal and may also be presented at relevant scientific conferences. ? 2018 Article author(s).",adult neurology; complementary medicine; diabetic neuropathy; neurology; neuropathology; therapeutics,"omega 3 fatty acid; omega 3 fatty acid; bibliographic database; diet supplementation; follow up; human; intracellular signaling; Likert scale; meta analysis; nerve cell necrosis; nerve conduction velocity; outcome assessment; peripheral nerve; peripheral neuropathy; Review; risk factor; signal transduction; systematic review; world health organization; diet therapy; dietary supplement; methodology; peripheral neuropathy; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); Dietary Supplements; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Humans; Nutrition Therapy; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design",2-s2.0-85053066070

Several manufacturers have introduced hearing AIDS that are claimed to provide gain for frequencies up to 10-12 kHz. However, there is currently limited evidence and very few independent studies evaluating the performance of the extended bandwidth hearing AIDS that have recently become available. Purpose: This study investigated an extended bandwidth hearing aid using measures of speech intelligibility and sound quality to find out whether there was a significant benefit of extended bandwidth amplification over standard amplification. Research Design: Repeated measures study designed to examine the efficacy of extended bandwidth amplification compared to standard bandwidth amplification. Study Sample: Sixteen adult participants with mild-to-moderate sensorineural hearing loss. Intervention: Participants were bilaterally fit with a pair of Widex Mind 440 behind-the-ear hearing AIDS programmedwith a standard bandwidth fitting and an extended bandwidth fitting; the latter provided gain up to 10 kHz. Data Collection and Analysis: For each fitting, and an unaided condition, participants completed two speech measures of aided benefit, the Quick Speech-in-Noise test (QuickSIN?) and the Phonak Phoneme Perception Test (PPT; high-frequency perception in quiet), and a measure of sound quality rating. Results: There were no significant differences found between unaided and aided conditions for QuickSIN? scores. For the PPT, there were statistically significantly lower (improved) detection thresholds at high frequencies (6 and 9 kHz) with the extended bandwidth fitting. Although not statistically significant, participants were able to distinguish between 6 and 9 kHz 50%better with extended bandwidth. No significant difference was found in ability to recognize phonemes in quiet between the unaided and aided conditions when phonemes only contained frequency content <6 kHz. However significant benefit was found with the extended bandwidth fitting for recognition of 9-kHz phonemes. No significant difference in sound quality preference was found between the standard bandwidth and extended bandwidth fittings. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that a pair of currently available extended bandwidth hearing AIDS was technically capable of delivering high-frequency amplification that was both audible and useable to listeners with mild-to-moderate hearing loss. This amplification was of acceptable sound quality. Further research, particularly field trials, is required to ascertain the real-world benefit of high-frequency amplification. ? 2018 American Academy of Audiology.

This study aimed to investigate the predictive values of acute findings, especially ocular, for long-term neurological outcomes.MethodsMedical records including retinal images of all children who attended the local Children's hospital with a diagnosis of NAI from over a period of 5 years were reviewed and data collected via the electronic patient record system. Patient demographics, injuries sustained, wide-field digital retinal images, visual acuity and sequalae, neurological function, and global function was noted. IBM SPSS software program was used for statistical analysis.ResultsOf the 38 patients (24 males, 14 females), 12 children died acutely from the head injury with the remaining 26 children available for long-term follow-up. A younger age of injury (P=0.004) was the only statistically significant predictor of good neurological outcome as compared with absence of macular retinoschisis, unilateral retinal haemorrhage, and unilateral subdural haemorrhage. Of the 38 children, 17 children had retinoschisis; 9 children with macular retinoschisis died acutely while 4 suffered a degree of developmental delay and only 4 were developmentally normal at the last follow-up. Long-term visual acuity data was available for 18 of the 26 survivors (range: NPL to Snellen 6/5). A statistical significance was noted between retinoschisis and worsened visual acuity (P<0.05).ConclusionsBilateral macular retinoschisis on acute presentation of NAI is associated with a seven-fold and unilateral with a four-fold increase in the development of a poor neurological outcome and eventual death. Conflicting to other studies, younger children presented better neurological outcomes. ?

Serum urate is a rational target for gout treatment given the central role of urate in disease causality, its association with key outcomes and its practicality of use in clinical practice. This review analyses the evidence for this strategy in gout. Recent Findings: Recent studies have confirmed the efficacy of urate-lowering therapy in achieving serum urate targets, both in trials using fixed doses and those applying a treat-to-target strategy. In a limited number of long-term studies (CloseSPigtSPi 12-month duration), interventions that incorporate a treat-to-target serum urate approach have been shown to promote regression of tophi, reduce the frequency of gout flares and improve MRI-detected synovitis. Summary: A strong case can be made for a treat-to-target serum urate strategy in gout, supported by existing knowledge of disease pathophysiology, outcomes from urate-lowering therapy studies and emerging results of randomised strategy trials of sufficient duration. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Gout; Treat to target; Urate; Urate-lowering therapy,"allopurinol; benzbromarone; febuxostat; lesinurad; pegloticase; urate; antigout agent; uric acid; arthrocentesis; bioaccumulation; degenerative disease; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; dyslipidemia; follow up; gout; human; hypertension; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; open study; pathogenesis; patient-reported outcome; population research; practice guideline; Review; synovitis; treatment duration; uric acid blood level; blood; dose response; drug monitoring; evidence based medicine; gout; practice guideline; procedures; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Monitoring; Evidence-Based Medicine; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Uric Acid",2-s2.0-85043266731

This negative association is hypothesized to be due in part to shifting the balance of estrogen and progesterone toward more progesterone and reduced ovulation during pregnancy. However, studies suggested that parity is also associated with estrogen-independent gynecological cancers suggesting balance of hormones may not be the only protective factor. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) play an important role in cell-to-cell communication in physiological and pathological conditions. During pregnancy, large amounts of EVs are extruded from the placenta, and they seem to be involved in the remarkable adaptation of a woman's body to normal pregnancy. We hypothesized that EVs extruded from the placenta play a role in this protective effect. Methods: Placental EVs were collected from first-trimester placentae, and cancer cell EVs were isolated from ovarian cancer cells. The EVs were exposed to ovarian cancer cells for 48 hours. The proliferation of cancer cells and the cell cycle were measured. In addition, phagocytosis of deported placental EVs by cancer cells was also measured. Results: The proliferation of cancer cells was significantly reduced by treatment with placental EVs (P = 0.001, analysis of variance), but not EVs from monocytes (P = 0.195), compared with untreated cancer cells. Furthermore, placental EVs also prevented the proliferation of cancer cells induced by cancer cell-derived EVs (P = 0.001). This inhibition of proliferation of ovarian cancer cells was partially due to phagocytosis of placental EVs by cancer cells. Phagocytosis of placental EVs delayed progression through the cell cycle. Calreticulin, a phagocytic ""eat me"" signal carried by placental EVs significantly inhibited ovarian cancer growth (P = 0.001). Conclusions: Our data demonstrated that EVs extruded from the placenta prevented ovarian cancer cell growth by a mechanism that involved delaying progression of the cell cycle after phagocytosis of the EVs. ?

We adopt a ‘global’ approach consistent with focus on the first law of thermodynamics – namely that the metabolic energy provided by dietary foodstuffs has only three possible fates: the performance of work (be it microscopic or macroscopic), the generation of heat, or storage – primarily in the form of adipose tissue. Quantification of the energy expended, in the form of fat metabolised, during selected endurance events, reveals the inherent limitation of over-reliance on exercise as a primary agent of weight loss. This result prompts examination of various (non-exercise based) possibilities of increasing the rate of heat loss. Since these, too, give little cause for optimism, we are obliged to conclude that obesity can be prevented, or weight loss achieved, only if exercise is supplemented by reduction of food intake. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",ATP; caloric intake; exercise; heat; weight loss; work,absorption; adipose tissue; body weight loss; enthalpy; exercise; food intake; heat loss; human; obesity; Review; thermodynamics; upper gastrointestinal tract; animal; digestion; gastrointestinal tract; metabolism; obesity; physiology; Animals; Digestion; Gastrointestinal Tract; Humans; Obesity; Thermodynamics; Weight Loss,2-s2.0-85041706934

We identify for the first time a cohort of blood recipients who remained uninfected despite large-dose exposure to HCV-contaminated blood and characterize immune factors that may confer protection. Of 1340 blood recipients from the English Look Back database who were transfused HCV-contaminated blood, we identified 8 who remained uninfected. In these 8 exposed uninfecteds, we characterized their natural killer (NK) cell populations and HCV-specific T-cell responses. Findings were compared with 10 spontaneous resolvers of HCV infection, 10 patients with chronic HCV infection and 10 healthy controls. Exposed uninfecteds had significantly greater numbers of NK cells with the activating receptor NKp30+ on CD56bright and CD56dim subsets compared with other groups (P?&lt;.05). Following interleukin-2 activation, NK cells of exposed uninfecteds had enhanced cytotoxicity that positively correlated with NKp30 expression (P?=.02). Differences in NKp80 and KIR2DL3 expression were also observed. HCV-specific T-cell responses were observed in some exposed uninfecteds but of low amplitude. Exposure without infection following transfusion of HCV-contaminated blood is a very rare phenomenon and suggests a high level of resistance to infection. Enhanced NK cell activation and killing, with weak HCV-specific T-cell responses, were observed many years after exposure in uninfected recipients and may contribute to protection from HCV acquisition, although additional protective factors are being sought in this important cohort. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",exposed uninfected; Hepatitis C; innate immunity; natural killer cells; NKp30,"CD56 antigen; interleukin 2; killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor 2DL3; natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3; CD56 antigen; killer cell immunoglobulin like receptor 2DL3; KIR2DL3 protein, human; KLRF1 protein, human; lectin; natural cytotoxicity triggering receptor 3; natural killer cell receptor; NCAM1 protein, human; NCR3 protein, human; adult; aged; Article; blood transfusion; cell activation; cell killing; cellular immunity; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; exposure; female; hepatitis C; human; human cell; infection resistance; innate immunity; intravenous drug abuse; male; natural killer cell; natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity; priority journal; protein expression; recipient; T lymphocyte; viral contamination; blood transfusion; chemistry; cytotoxicity test; England; environmental exposure; hepatitis C; immunology; middle aged; natural killer cell; Adult; Aged; Blood Transfusion; CD56 Antigen; Cohort Studies; Cytotoxicity Tests, Immunologic; England; Environmental Exposure; Female; Hepatitis C; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Lectins, C-Type; Male; Middle Aged; Natural Cytotoxicity Triggering Receptor 3; Receptors, KIR2DL3; Receptors, Natural Killer Cell; T-Lymphocytes",2-s2.0-85034573941

However, there is limited and inconsistent data on the effect of vitamin D supplementation on liver function. Hepatic enzymes have been used as surrogate markers for NAFLD and have been associated with metabolic syndrome. We examined the relationships between 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) and γ-glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) in 120 drug-na?ve individuals with no history of liver disease. In addition, the effect of vitamin D supplementation (100,000 loading dose of cholecalciferol followed by 4000IU daily for 16 weeks) on hepatic enzymes was investigated in a subgroup of 54 vitamin D-deficient overweight or obese individuals (28 randomised to cholecalciferol and 26 to placebo). Hepatic enzymes, anthropometric parameters, lipid profile, insulin sensitivity (hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp, M value) and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) were measured before and after the intervention. In the cross-sectional study, levels of GGT and ALT were higher in men compared to women (both p = 0.001). There were no significant differences in GGT, ALT and ALP between vitamin D categories (25(OH)D< 25 nmol/L, 25–50 nmol/L, and >50 nmol/L) and no relationships were found between the three enzymes and 25(OH)D before and after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, WHR, and insulin sensitivity (all p >0.5). In the randomised trial, 25(OH)D concentrations increased in the vitamin D group (mean change 57.0 ± 21.3 nmol/L) compared to the placebo group (mean change 1.9 ± 15.1 nmol/L). Mean changes in GGT, ALT and ALP were not significantly different between vitamin D and placebo groups (all p >0.2). Change in 25(OH)D concentration was not correlated with changes in GGT, ALT and ALP before and after adjustments for age and sex (all p >0.1). In summary, 25(OH)D concentrations were not related to hepatic enzymes in drug-naive adults with no history of liver disease, and vitamin D supplementation had no effect on the serum levels of hepatic enzymes in vitamin D-deficient and overweight or obese, otherwise healthy individuals. Hence, vitamin D supplementation is unlikely to prevent incident NAFLD. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D); Alanine aminotransferase (ALT); Alkaline phosphatase (ALP); Insulin resistance; Obesity; γ-Glutamyl transferase (GGT),25 hydroxyvitamin D; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; C reactive protein; colecalciferol; gamma glutamyltransferase; liver enzyme; placebo; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; gamma glutamyltransferase; vitamin; vitamin D; adult; anthropometric parameters; Article; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; double blind procedure; female; human; insulin sensitivity; major clinical study; male; obesity; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin supplementation; adolescent; blood; diet therapy; dietary supplement; enzymology; liver; middle aged; obesity; vitamin D deficiency; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alanine Transaminase; Alkaline Phosphatase; Dietary Supplements; Double-Blind Method; Female; gamma-Glutamyltransferase; Humans; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Overweight; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency; Vitamins; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85029773549

Despite the importance of appropriate pre-hospital transport, there is little evidence base to assist medical staff on optimal destination policy for emergent pre-hospital transport. This paper explores the spatial relationship of patient transfers prior to the implementation of the Midland Pre-Hospital Trauma Destination Matrix in New Zealand, and is a retrospective view of practice against a destination policy that was applied affer the study period. METHODS: We use data obtained from the Midland Trauma Registry merged with Global Positioning System (GPS) data from St John and Land Information New Zealand Data Service on major trauma occurring in 2014 and 2015. Using ArcGIS, data were analysed for spatial relationships between factors associated with major trauma events and pre-hospital transportation. RESULTS: In the retrospective analysis of 162 major trauma patients, 107 (66%) were transported to a hospital that matched the destination specified in the Matrix, and 55 (34%) were transported to a non-Matrix designated hospital. CONCLUSION: Approximately one-third of patients were not directly transported to the preferred definitive care hospital subsequently defined in the Midland Pre-Hospital Trauma Destination Matrix. Ongoing monitoring of the pre-hospital transportation system and the implementation of a formal pre-hospital transport policy may improve the efficiency of the Midland Trauma System. Future studies should examine the possible reasons for variations in triage decisions across the Midland Region. ?

Owing to concerns about high complication and failure rates, our department began to favour autologous reconstructive in patients requiring XRT in 2013. This study assesses the outcomes of IBBR prior to and following this policy change. METHODS: The records of all patients who underwent first-stage IBBR in 2012 and 2013 in our department were reviewed. Patients undergoing peri-operative XRT were identified. Complications and failure rates were analysed. RESULTS: Over two years, 77 IBBRs were performed in 53 patients. In 2012, 11 patients underwent peri-operative XTR compared with five in 2013. Radiotherapy was significantly associated with higher reconstructive failure rates while pre-operative XRT was associated with more complications overall (p=0.0099). Over the two years, the number of IBBRs with any complication fell from 16 (43.2%) to 11 (27.5%) while reconstructive failure fell from six (16.2%) to four (10%). CONCLUSIONS: Peri-operative XRT increases complication rates and reconstructive failure with IBBR. Our current policy of recommending autologous reconstruction if they have had pre-operative XRT seems to be resulting in decreased complication rates and increased reconstructive success. ?

METHOD: Data were collected via a comprehensive paper-pencil questionnaire handed out to 798 consecutive new patients seen at the WPS over a four-year period. RESULTS: 32.3% attending the WPS were men and 67.7% women, with a mean age of 52.1 years. 65.7% of patients were New Zealand Europeans, followed by 19.1% other Europeans, 5.7% Asians, 3.9% Maori, 2.8% Middle Eastern/Latin/Africans and 2.7% Pacific Islanders. Patients reported an average of 2.6 visits to the GP before presenting to the unit. Average pain duration was seven years and seven months. Women reported a significantly higher number of pain sites in the whole body, as well as in the left and right side of the body compared to men (p<0.0001 for all). Highest interference due to pain was found for enjoyment of life. Men and women further differed in a range of psycho-behavioural variables, with women reporting less psychological distress and depression but more stress compared to men (p<0.05 for all). Men showed higher levels of kinesiophobia (p<0.005) and less pain acceptance and pain willingness (p<0.05 for both). Cross-cultural comparison found M?ori patients reported highest pain levels, highest number of pain sites, highest pain interference, as well as highest levels of psychological distress, depression, stress and anxiety compared to all other ethnicities. Lowest pain severity was reported for New Zealand European patients and lowest interference due to pain for Pacific Islanders. While Middle Eastern/Latin/African patients showed highest levels of kinesiophobia, Pacific Islanders had the highest tendencies to catastrophise about their pain. CONCLUSION: There are important sex- and ethnicity-related differences in the clinical presentation of chronic pain patients attending a large, hospital-based New Zealand pain service. While service provision can be based on generalised guidelines, specific interventions should be informed by important demographic and cultural variables. Studies are needed to identify strategies to improve service delivery in subgroups of the population who may be undertreated or lack access to appropriate interventions. ?

However, mental illness that is adequately treated would not be expected to lead to increased violence risk. This study compared incidents of violence toward children perpetrated by parents who were newly discharged from inpatient psychiatric treatment with violence perpetrated by other parents in the same communities to determine whether parents with treated mental illness had an elevated risk of child abuse perpetration. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study was conducted. Violence toward children reported by parents and by collateral informants at the initial ten-week follow-up interview was analyzed for two groups: study participants discharged from inpatient psychiatric facilities and parents in the community matched by neighborhood. Results: Of the 416 parents in the participant group, 20 (5%) committed violence toward a child in the ten weeks after discharge, compared with 41 (14%) of the 299 parents in the comparison group. In the participant group, diagnostic categories of parents who committed violence toward a child were as follows: serious mental illness only (8% of whom were violent), substance use disorder only (3%), both serious mental illness and substance use disorder (4%), and another issue (7%). Conclusions: This study found that parents with treated serious mental illness were not at higher risk than other parents in their community of perpetrating violence toward children. Parents who were admitted to an acute psychiatric facility and treated appeared to be at lower risk of being violent toward children than other parents in their community. ?

Background: Primary care is struggling to meet the needs and demands of complex older people. New models which incorporate holistic assessment and care coordination are necessary. Design: A qualitative descriptive general inductive design was used. Methods: Older people at risk of health and functional decline were identified and received a comprehensive gerontology assessment and care coordination. Older adults (75?years+) enrolled within one of three primary healthcare practices in Auckland, New Zealand were eligible. Healthcare professionals directly involved with the primary healthcare gerontology nurse specialist model were invited for study participation. Face-to-face interviews were held with five older people and six health professionals were interviewed by telephone. A semistructured interview guide was used for all interviews. A general inductive approach was undertaken for analysis to systematically identify codes and themes. Results: Data analysis revealed two central themes from the older people perspective: “holistic expertise” and “communication.” Two main themes were identified from the health professional perspective: “competency” and “service delivery.” Results showed the gerontology nurse specialist role was highly regarded by both older people and the health professionals. The in-home comprehensive geriatric assessment was identified as greatly beneficial. Conclusions: The competence and care coordination of the gerontology nurse specialist reduced fragmentation and were deemed immensely valuable. Care coordination should be recognised as a key component to meeting the complex needs of at-risk older people in the community. Relevance to clinical practice: The expert knowledge of the gerontology nurse specialist and in-home comprehensive geriatric assessment were crucial aspects of the new model. Equally important was the assimilation of primary and secondary care infrastructure to upskill and deliver mentorship to the gerontology nurse specialist. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",care coordination; case finding; gerontology nurse specialist; older adults; primary care,aged; clinical competence; clinical trial; female; geriatric assessment; geriatric nursing; health service; human; interview; male; multicenter study; New Zealand; nurse specialist; organization and management; primary health care; qualitative research; standards; Aged; Clinical Competence; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Geriatric Nursing; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; New Zealand; Nurse Specialists; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research,2-s2.0-85034241062

We aimed to investigate the predictors of type of milk consumption in preschool children. METHODS: Data were drawn from a cross-sectional study which enrolled preschool children (2-<5 years, n=1,329) from throughout New Zealand. RESULTS: Cows’ milk was consumed regularly by 88% of children. Of these, 26% consumed plain lowor reduced-fat milk, while 74% consumed full-fat milk. The adjusted odds of consuming plain low- or reduced-fat milk were increased in older children: three-year old (OR=1.80, 95% CI 1.29-2.50); four-year old (OR=1.93, 95% CI 1.38-2.72) versus two-year old children, and were decreased in Maori (OR=0.56, 95% CI 0.36-0.88) and Pacific children (OR=0.32, 95% CI 0.12-0.86) compared with New Zealand European children. Approximately 18% of children were overweight/obese. The odds (adjusted for sociodemographic characteristics) of consuming plain low- or reduced-fat milk were increased in overweight children (OR=1.74, 95% CI 1.20-2.54) than normal weight children. CONCLUSIONS: The type of milk consumed by preschool children varies with child demographics and anthropometry. Further research is warranted to investigate caregivers/parents’ knowledge about dietary guidelines and to determine the causal relationship between obesity and milk type consumption. The findings of the current study may have important implications for developing and shaping interventions and in helping shape public health policy and practice to promote cows’ milk consumption in preschool children. ?

Methods: M?ori, Pacific, and Asian ethnicity individuals who failed to return a bowel screening test kit within four weeks of it being posted were randomly allocated (1:1) to a telephone active follow-up service or a control group. The active follow-up service made multiple attempts to contact the invitee and provide support. Participation rates at eight weeks’ post-randomisation were compared, and the effect of the intervention on overall participation rates was imputed. Results: A total of 3828 eligible individuals were allocated to active follow-up and 3773 to the control group. The imputed potential overall increase in participation in the active follow-up group was 2.0% (95% CI = 0.6%–3.4%); however, the impact of follow-up varied significantly by ethnicity and deprivation. The imputed increase in participation was significant for M?ori (5.2; CI = 1.8%–8.5%) and Pacific (3.6%; CI = 0.7%–6.4%), but not for Asian ethnicities (0.7%; CI=?1.1%–2.4%). In addition, the imputed increase was significant among high deprivation participants (3.9%; CI = 2.0%–5.9%), but not among low deprivation participants (0.3%; CI=?1.6%–2.2%). Conclusions: Active follow-up led to higher bowel screening participation in M?ori and Pacific but not in Asian ethnicities and was more effective in high deprivation subjects.

Mouse models of hypercholesterolaemia have been used to identify arterial proteins involved in atherosclerosis. As the liver is extremely sensitive to dyslipidemia, one might expect major changes in the abundance of liver proteins in these models even before atherosclerosis develops. Methods. Lipid levels were measured and a proteomic approach was used to quantify proteins in the livers of mice with an elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and the presence of lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] but no atherosclerosis. Results. The livers of Lp(a) mice showed an increased triglyceride but reduced phospholipid and oxidised lipid content. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis identified 24 liver proteins with significantly increased abundance in Lp(a) mice (P<0.05). A bioinformatic analysis of the 24 proteins showed the major effect was that of an enhanced antioxidant and lipid efflux response with significant increases in antioxidant (Park7, Gpx1, Prdx6, and Sod1) and lipid metabolism proteins (Fabp4, Acaa2, apoA4, and ApoA1). Interestingly, human liver cells treated with Lp(a) showed significant increases in Gpx1 and Prdx6 but not Sod1 or Park7. Conclusions.

Working smarter can mean the development of new drug discovery paradigms and then demonstrating their utility and reproducibility to industry. The collaboration between Vern Schramm's group at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, USA and Peter Tyler at the Ferrier Research Institute at The Victoria University of Wellington, NZ has refined a drug discovery process called transition state analogue design. This process has been applied to several biomedically relevant nucleoside processing enzymes. In 2017, Mundesine?, conceived using transition state analogue design, received market approval for the treatment of peripheral T-cell lymphoma in Japan. This short review looks at a brief history of transition state analogue design, the fundamentals behind the development of this process, and the success of enzyme inhibitors produced using this drug design methodology. ? 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,enzyme inhibitor; forodesine; mundesine; nucleosidase; nucleoside; purine nucleoside phosphorylase; drug approval; drug design; drug development; drug industry; drug marketing; drug research; human; Japan; medical school; nonhuman; priority journal; reproducibility; Review; T cell lymphoma; United States,2-s2.0-85058627193

Method: This study involved all women who were diagnosed with primary invasive breast cancer in two health regions, had undergone a mastectomy, and met the “strong recommendation” criteria for PMRT based on New Zealand National Guidelines. We performed logistic regression analyses to identify demographic and clinical factors associated with the receipt of PMRT. Results: Of the 1455 patients with stage II to III cancers included in this analysis, 1195 (82%) received radiotherapy. The receipt of PMRT decreased with increasing age, and was significantly lower in rural residents, M?ori and Pacific women, those with more comorbidity, those who received primary cancer care in a public facility, and those diagnosed with stage III cancer. Although not significant, the receipt was also lower in patients who resided in more deprived neighborhood, and those with comorbidities. The findings restricted to stage III patients (n?=?1325), and to those diagnosed since 2010 (n?=?422), after the current guidelines were published, which were very similar to the whole cohort. Conclusion: Disparities exist in the receipt of PMRT in breast cancer patients in New Zealand, underscoring the need for a greater equity focus in management of breast cancer. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",breast cancer; mastectomy; radiotherapy; utilization,,2-s2.0-85056473607

Eighty-two participants from a sexual health clinic in Adelaide, South Australia, who were involved in a randomised controlled trial investigating the effectiveness of an ASSIST-linked BI delivered at baseline, were re-interviewed 3 months later and were administered a semi-structured questionnaire designed to elicit participant perspectives on the BI. Overall, participants' comments were positive, with 78% reporting that the BI had some influence on their drug-taking behaviour 72% reporting they had attempted to reduce drug use. Their comments highlighted several ways in which the BI helped them become 'aware' of the potential risks of using, the risks of continued substance use, the benefits of stopping or cutting down substance use and the strategies they used to change their behaviour. A smaller proportion of participants reported that the BI had no influence.

Ensuring high quality service is challenging as it not only demands detailed domain-specific knowledge, but also the ability to quickly understand the clients’ issues through their diverse — and often casual — descriptions. This paper aims to provide a framework for the development of an automated information broker agent who performs the task of a helper. The main task of the agent is to interact with the client and direct them to obtain further services that cater their personalized need. To do so, the agent should accomplish a sequence of tasks that include natural language inquiry, knowledge gathering, reasoning, and giving feedback; in this way, it simulates a human helper to engage in interaction with the client. The framework combines a question-answering reasoning mechanism while utilizing domain-specific knowledge base. When the users cannot describe clearly their needs, the system tries to narrow down the possibilities by an iterative question-answering process, until it eventually identifies the target. In realizing our framework, we make a proof-of-concept project, M andy, a primary care chatbot system created to assist healthcare staffs by automating the patient intake process. We describe in detail the system functionalities and design of the system, and evaluate our proof-of-concept on benchmark case studies. ? 2018, Systems Engineering Society of China and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",AI and healthcare; automated information broker; chatbot; iterative inquiry; language processing; Question and answer system,,2-s2.0-85054308091

Methods: Retrospective chart review of adolescent patients with T1DM seen within the paediatric diabetes service in Auckland, New Zealand, from 2006 to 2016. MA, HTN, patient demographic characteristics and ACEI prescribing and monitoring indices were examined. Results: Five hundred adolescents with T1DM were included. There were 26 patients (5%) with MA and/or HTN. MA alone was present in 16, HTN alone in 3 and both HTN and MA in 7. The 5-year MA/HTN-free rate was 98%, and the 10-year MA/HTN-free rate was 93%. Longer disease duration and earlier diagnosis were predictors of MA/HTN. There was no significant difference in standard clinical indices between study patients and others. ACEI was prescribed for 17 of 26 patients for either HTN or MA. Within 6 weeks of ACEI commencement, less than half of the subjects had repeat serum creatinine and MA screens and no record of repeat blood pressure measurement. Despite this, all patients had 3-monthly reviews within outpatient clinics where adjustments of ACEI doses were made. Conclusion: In our regional adolescent population with T1DM, there were low rates of both MA and/or HTN. In those who required treatment with ACEI, clinical monitoring post-commencement of therapy was inconsistent.

Unfortunately the human body has approximately 200 bones and 600 skeletal muscles giving rise to a broad range of degrees of freedom. To effectively capture this movement with dielectric elastomer sensors a substantial network is required. One often overlooked challenge is the connection between the dielectric elastomer sensor and central electronics. On land this is as simple as wires connecting the two. Underwater however, especially when considering a network of sensors, this becomes a more complicated task. In the proposed method parallel plate capacitors are used to transfer power across the encapsulation layer to the sensor, removing any need for protruding wires or cable glands. With one electrode placed within the encapsulation and the second connected to the sensor, sensors are replaceable even underwater. To maintain sensor performance however, a relatively high capacitance is required. For example if the coupling capacitance is 20x greater than sensor capacitance, sensitivity is reduce by approximately 20%. Whereas if the coupling capacitance is only 10x greater, sensitivity is reduced by 40%. Due to these high capacitance requirements combined with the area and weight restrictions of wearable applications, we have investigated the practicality of implementing capacitive coupling. A capacitive coupling interface has been developed and tested with dielectric elastomer sensors underwater. Analysis of the interface's impact on sensor sensitivity, measurement electronics and overall coupling capacitor size is presented. ? COPYRIGHT SPIE.

However, little is known about the utility of item level scores for informing the implementation of supported employment programs. OBJECTIVE: To explore the utility of item level scores from the IPS-25 fidelity scale for developing evidence based practices in supported employment for people with severe mental illnesses in Sussex, United Kingdom (UK). METHODS: Fidelity was assessed in 18 sites representing 34 independent cohorts where IPS was implemented by one organisation. Item-level fidelity scores were examined descriptively. Nine item level correlations were selected a-priori and examined with respect to two employment milestones and program attrition. RESULTS: Mean total fidelity score was associated with commencing competitive employment (r = 0.36, p = 0.04). None of the three items selected as likely to be related to either commencing employment or to employment duration, were correlated as expected. Of the three items selected as likely to influence attrition, only one 'Rapid commencement of job searching' was correlated as expected (r = 0.38, p = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Individual fidelity score items appear useful for improving supported employment programs, in terms of item response characteristics and expected correlations with particular program outcomes. ? 2018-IOS Press and the authors.

However, the in vitro and in vivo efficacy as heterobivalent and multivalent RGD systems for both molecular imaging and targeted radiotherapy (theranostic radiopharmaceuticals) has been scarcely studied. In our research, the design, synthesis, and in vitro characterization of the heterobivalent 99mTc-labeled trans-activator of transcription (49–57)-RGDyK peptide (99mTc-Tat(49–57)-RGDyK) and the multivalent 177Lu-labeled gold nanoparticle-(RGD)100 system (177Lu-AuNP-c[RGDfK(C)]) were first developed. Secondly, the in vivo imaging of tumors over-expressing integrins and the radiation absorbed dose estimations to produce a therapeutic effect by Auger and low-energy electrons from 99mTc internalized in cancer cell nuclei, as well as the effect of beta particles emitted from 177Lu decay, were performed. In this chapter, the following protocols for the developed systems are presented: (1) the synthesis and radiolabeling of heterobivalent RGD peptide and multivalent AuNP-RGDs, (2) the physicochemical and in vitro biochemical characterization of the systems, (3) the radiation absorbed dose assessment, and (4) the in vivo evaluation of the heterobivalent and multivalent radiopharmaceuticals for molecular imaging and targeted radiotherapy.

Results: The participant completion rate was 97.6% (95% CI 93.1–99.5%). The proportions (95% CI) of participants who may be excluded for antibiotic or corticosteroid use in the 30?days prior to the study, or due to receiving the influenza vaccine in the previous two years were 9.6% (5.1–16.2), 8.0% (3.9–14.2) and 61.6% (52.5–70.2), respectively. All participants were stratified into four gut microbiota enterotypes. There was no association between these enterotypes and the antibody response to the influenza vaccine, although the study was not powered for this outcome. Conclusion: This study design is suitable for the Proposed Study. The completion rate is likely to be high, although exclusion criteria should be selected with care. Further analyses of gut microbiota composition or function in association with antibody and immune responses are warranted to explore the role of host–microbiota interactions on protective immunity. ? 2018 The Authors.

Gathering additional valuable information contained in the datasets represents a crucial opportunity in the biomedical field. To facilitate and stimulate utilization of these datasets, we have recently developed an interactive data browsing and visualization web application, the Gene Expression Browser (GXB). In this note, we describe a curated compendium of 13 public datasets on human breast cancer, representing a total of 2142 transcriptome profiles. We classified the samples according to different immune based classification systems and integrated this information into the datasets. Annotated and harmonized datasets were uploaded to GXB. Study samples were categorized in different groups based on their immunologic tumor response profiles, intrinsic molecular subtypes and multiple clinical parameters. Ranked gene lists were generated based on relevant group comparisons. In this data note, we demonstrate the utility of GXB to evaluate the expression of a gene of interest, find differential gene expression between groups and investigate potential associations between variables with a specific focus on immunologic classification in breast cancer.

We sought to understand the perceptions of caregivers and health-care providers regarding the potential introduction of routine varicella vaccination. Methods: A qualitative exploratory study was conducted using semi-structured interviews with caregivers and providers (N = 20) in Auckland. Key themes from the interviews were identified through thematic analysis using a combination of deductive and inductive coding. Results: All of the participants were aware of varicella but levels of awareness varied among caregivers regarding the varicella vaccine. Participants expressed positive support towards universal varicella vaccination and a high intention to vaccinate if available as a routine vaccine. However, many concerns were raised about multiple injections at a single immunisation visit, and participants suggested alternative scheduling options. Conclusion: The results indicated a need to raise awareness among caregivers about the varicella vaccine, focusing on positive health beliefs about vaccination in terms of protecting the child's health and reducing the impact of a child getting varicella on the family. Health-care providers and government health authorities may play an important role in increasing positive health beliefs about the varicella vaccine. Should the varicella vaccine be introduced as proposed, our findings recommend an educational campaign to address both caregiver and provider concerns about multiple injections and how to manage alternative immunisation schedules. These insights may help inform national strategies for the proposed addition to increase acceptance of the varicella vaccination. ? 2017 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",chickenpox; children; immunisation; New Zealand; qualitative; vaccination; varicella,"chickenpox vaccine; chickenpox vaccine; adult; Article; attitude assessment; attitude to health; awareness; caregiver; clinical practice; controlled study; educational status; ethnic difference; exploratory research; female; health belief; health care personnel; health care planning; health education; health program; health promotion; household income; human; medical decision making; New Zealand; perception; practice guideline; priority journal; qualitative analysis; semi structured interview; vaccination; vaccination refusal; chickenpox; decision making; immunization; infant; interview; legislation and jurisprudence; male; middle aged; New Zealand; preschool child; psychology; qualitative research; vaccination; Adult; Attitude to Health; Caregivers; Chickenpox; Chickenpox Vaccine; Child, Preschool; Decision Making; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Immunization Schedule; Infant; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Perception; Qualitative Research; Vaccination",2-s2.0-85041839306

A qualitative study examining retirement village residents’ resuscitation decisions,2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041085951&doi=10.1111%2fpsyg.12286&partnerID=40&md5=9a2c9d18bf628f47fb06657f4f1c93a8,"Background: There is a dearth of qualitative research on resuscitation preferences of older New Zealanders. The aim of this study was to investigate the resuscitation preferences of older New Zealanders in a retirement village or residential care setting, as well as the reasons for these preferences. Methods: This study had 37 participants from two retirement villages in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants were interviewed about a hypothetical case vignette about cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and then they completed a semi-structured interview. Interviews were subsequently transcribed and analyzed by two independent researchers using thematic qualitative methodology. Results: The majority of the participants (n = 25, 67.6%) decided against resuscitation, 10 (27.0%) wanted resuscitation, and 2 (5.4%) were ambivalent about their resuscitation preferences. Three main themes emerged during the data analysis regarding participants’ reasons for deciding against resuscitation: (i) the wish for a natural death; (ii) advanced age; and (iii) a realistic awareness about the consequences of resuscitation. Responses related to the third these had three subthemes: (i) reduced quality of life; (ii) loss of personal integrity and sense of existence; and (iii) concern that resuscitation could result in unnecessary costs or a burden on others. Among participants who preferred resuscitation, two main themes emerged regarding their reasons for wanting resuscitation: (i) the wish to prolong a good quality of life; and (ii) unrealistic expectations of resuscitation. Conclusions: Older people in this study were able to make reasoned decisions about resuscitation based on balancing their subjective estimations of quality of life and the presumed consequences of resuscitation. It is important therefore to educate older adults about the potential outcomes of resuscitation and explore (and document) their reasoning when discussing resuscitation preferences so their wishes can be respected. ? 2018 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society",decision-making; end-of-life care; resuscitation orders,"aged; Article; awareness; data analysis; death; decision making; disease burden; female; groups by age; health care cost; human; male; New Zealand; New Zealander; patient preference; priority journal; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; quality of life; residential care; resuscitation; retirement; rural population; semi structured interview; treatment refusal; adult; attitude to health; decision making; middle aged; patient participation; patient preference; psychology; resuscitation; retirement; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Decision Making; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Patient Participation; Patient Preference; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; Resuscitation; Resuscitation Orders; Retirement",2-s2.0-85041085951

We examined how demographic and clinical factors varied with different subgroups of CVAF parameters. METHODS Quantile regression was applied to a cross-sectional analysis of 4,167 adults (56% male; age range, 50-84 years) from 4 ethnic groups (3,419 New Zealand European, 303 Pacific, 227 Maori, and 218 South Asian) and without diagnosed cardiac arrhythmia. Pulse rate variability (root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and SD of pulse intervals) and baroreflex sensitivity were response variables. Independent variables were age, sex, ethnicity, brachial and aortic blood pressure (BP) variables, body mass index (BMI), and diabetes. RESULTS Ordinary linear regression showed that age, sex, Pacific and Maori ethnicity, BP variables, BMI, and diabetes were associated with CVAF parameters. But quantile regression revealed that, across CVAF percentiles, the slopes for these relationships: (i) varied by more than 10-fold in several cases and sometimes changed direction and (ii) noticeably differed in magnitude often (by >3-fold in several cases) compared to ordinary linear regression coefficients. For instance, age was inversely associated with RMSSD at the 10 th percentile of this parameter (β = -0.12 ms/year, 95% confidence interval = -0.18 to -0.09 ms/year) but had a positive relationship at the 90 th percentile (β = 3.17 ms/year, 95% confidence interval = 2.50 to 4.04 ms/year). CONCLUSIONS The relationships of demographic and clinical factors with CVAF parameters are, in many cases, not uniform. Quantile regression provides an improved assessment of these associations. ?

METHODS: Patients with diabetes and recorded diagnosis of CN were identified from the podiatry service records. Clinical details were retrospectively obtained from WDHB databases and patient medical records. RESULTS: Forty-one patients were included, 31 had type 2 diabetes, 10 had type 1 diabetes. At presentation, the median duration of all-type diabetes was 15 years. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 17 weeks. Symptoms at presentation were: oedema (49%), warmth (73%), erythema (17%), swelling (90%) and pain (60%). Concomitant ulcers were present in 32%, deformities 83%, osteomyelitis 2% and septic arthritis 2%. Mean time to ambulation in modified shoes was 21.3 weeks (±11.5). Complication rates one year from diagnosis for ulcers, osteomyelitis, amputations and all-cause mortality were 34%, 2%, 2% and 5% respectively. CONCLUSION: Time to diagnosis of CN was shorter than previously reported, though the high rate of deformities still suggests a significant delay in diagnosis. Increased education of healthcare professionals and people with diabetes-related neuropathy is important to ensure early diagnosis and appropriate management to reduce deformities and complications. ?

However, there is little evidence that revascularisation improves outcomes, compared with medical management. This study assessed survival and cardiovascular outcomes in patients with ESRF undergoing coronary angiography and then having coronary artery bypass gra (CABG) surgery, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medical management. METHODS: Survival and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) were examined in all patients with ESRF who underwent coronary angiography at Auckland City Hospital between 2003 and 2012. Outcomes of patients who underwent revascularisation (CABG or PCI) were compared with those managed medically. RESULTS: Two hundred and eighty-eight patients with ESRF had a total of 382 diagnostic coronary angiograms. Ninety-one (32%) patients underwent revascularisation (61 PCI, 30 CABG), with the other 197 (68%) treated medically or requiring no specific cardiac treatment. The median survival was 3.3 (IQR 2.1–5.3) years in patients undergoing CABG, 2.9 (IQR 1.5–5.4) years in patients treated with PCI and 2.9 (IQR 1.3–5.5) years in patients managed medically. There was no significant di- erence in survival between treatment modalities in the entire cohort, nor in the 108 patients with triple vessel disease. Similarly, there was no di- erence in the incidence of major adverse cardiac events, comparing medical management with revascularisation. CONCLUSION: There was no apparent survival advantage with revascularisation by either CABG or PCI, compared with medical management, in patients with ESRF undergoing coronary angiography. This study confirms the poor prognosis of patients with ESRF and coronary disease. Observational studies cannot control for all potential confounders; randomised trial data are needed to guide optimal management of this high-risk patient cohort. ?

Conclusions: This is the first study to investigate attitudes and practices of NZ paediatricians regarding GAT for severely disabled children. Results indicate a range of views but suggest that family requests for GAT do occur and that the majority of paediatricians are not opposed to GAT in the appropriate ethical and clinical context. The development of practice guidelines for GAT may lead to a more informed decision-making process about GAT for families and paediatricians. ? 2017 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",children; disability; ethics; growth attenuation therapy,"estrogen; growth inhibitor; Article; child; child health care; clinical article; clinical decision making; clinical practice; cognitive defect; consultation; disease severity; family attitude; female; growth attenuation therapy; handicapped child; health survey; hormonal therapy; human; hysterectomy; male; medical ethics; menorrhagia; metrorrhagia; New Zealand; online system; pediatrician; physical disability; physician attitude; practice guideline; preschool child; prescription; priority journal; school child; treatment duration; treatment indication; attitude to health; pediatrician; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Child; Child, Preschool; Disabled Children; Female; Growth Inhibitors; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Pediatricians; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85021745092

Method: Interviews and focus groups were conducted with a purposive convenience sample of 74 mental health consumers and carers across three Australian states, representing metropolitan, rural and remote settings, including those with culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. Recruitment and interviews continued until data saturation was reached. Interviews and group discussions were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim, and data were managed using NVivo? software. A ‘coding framework’ or set of themes was created, and all transcripts were coded accordingly. Thematic analysis was informed by a general inductive approach. Results: Participants had unmet needs for information from community pharmacy. They expressed the requirement for receiving easy-to-understand, relevant medication information about mental health management from community pharmacy staff, communicated in a respectful way, with clear and comprehensive medication labelling, while respecting consumer privacy. Conclusion: The information needs of mental health consumers and carers remain largely unmet within Australian community pharmacy. This was particularly evident regarding the provision of information about adverse effects of medicines. The overall perceived lack of information is experienced as disempowering. Practice implications: Australian community pharmacy is well placed to respond to the unmet demand for information needs of mental health consumers and carers. While many community pharmacies are embracing the principles of patient-centred care, there is an opportunity to optimise the quality of care provided to mental health consumers and carers. ? 2017 Royal Pharmaceutical Society",Australia; community pharmacy; consumers; information needs; mental health,adult; Article; Australia; Australian; caregiver; comprehension; confidentiality; consumer attitude; convenience sample; cultural factor; drug information; drug labeling; female; human; information processing; interpersonal communication; interview; language ability; major clinical study; male; medical information; mental health care; mental patient; needs assessment; patient counseling; pharmacist attitude; pharmacy; priority journal; purposive sample; qualitative research; thematic analysis; urban rural difference; access to information; caregiver; consumer attitude; health service; information dissemination; mental health; middle aged; needs assessment; organization and management; patient care; pharmacist; pharmacy; procedures; psychology; software; young adult; Access to Information; Adult; Australia; Caregivers; Community Pharmacy Services; Consumer Behavior; Female; Focus Groups; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Information Dissemination; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Patient-Centered Care; Pharmacies; Pharmacists; Qualitative Research; Software; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85015280806

Passive noise control techniques are impractical and very expensive for lowfrequency noises. To solve such acoustic problem active noise control has been studied since early 20th century. Active noise control is based on the principle of superposition: I.e., it mitigates the unwanted noise by generating an anti-noise having the same amplitude but opposite in phase. In this paper, we present the physical classification of the existing literature on the basis of both noise source and quiet zone characteristics. Examples are point to point, point to zone, zone to point and zone to zone.

METHODS: Metabolic monitoring policies from DHBs and one private clinic were analysed in relation to a best practice standard developed from the current literature and published guidelines relevant to metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: Fourteen of New Zealand’s 20 DHBs currently have metabolic monitoring policies for consumers prescribed antipsychotic medication. Two of those policies are consistent with the literature-based guideline. Eight policies include actions to be taken when consumers meet criteria for metabolic syndrome. Four DHBs have systems for measuring their rates of metabolic monitoring. There is no consensus on who is clinically responsible for metabolic monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Metabolic monitoring by mental health services in New Zealand reflects international experience that current levels of monitoring are low and policies are not always in place. Collaboration across the mental health and primary care sectors together with the adoption of a consensus guideline is needed to improve rates of monitoring and reduce current rates of physical health morbidities. ?

METHODS: We described admissions for children aged 5–11 years to the main hospital in Tonga from January 2009 to December 2013. Rates with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were compared using rate ratios (RR). RESULTS: There were 1,816 admissions. The average annual admission rate was 20.2/1,000 (95% CI 19.3–21.1). Hospital admission rates were higher in younger than older children (5–7 versus 8–11 years, RR=1.28, 95% CI 1.18–1.41) and in boys than girls (RR=1.52, 95% CI 1.38–1.68). Injury and poisoning (28%), non-respiratory infectious diseases (19%), respiratory conditions (16%), abdominal/surgical conditions (13%) and dental (9%) were the most frequent admission reasons. A larger proportion of younger versus older children were hospitalised for dental (16% vs 1%, P<0.001) or respiratory conditions (18% vs 14%, P=0.02). A larger proportion of older children were hospitalised for abdominal/surgical conditions (15% vs 11%, P=0.008), other infectious diseases (21% vs 17%, P=0.04), other conditions (10% vs 6%, P<0.001) and cardiac conditions (2% vs 1%, P<0.001).

Aim: The aim of our study was: to study patients’ representation of COPD as reflected in their drawings of their lungs; and to examine scores on a validated measure that assesses illness perceptions (ie, Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire [B-IPQ]). Patients and methods: One hundred outpatients with COPD, mean age 70 years, selected from a pharmacy database, participated and 98 filled out the B-IPQ. Eighty-seven patients completed the drawing task. Results: The illness perceptions as reflected in the responses to the B-IPQ scales represented a quite optimistic view of COPD and its consequences. The drawings of the lungs reflected a considerable discordance between patients’ representations and medically accepted representations of lungs of a person with COPD. Conclusion: Assessing illness perceptions in clinical care and research about COPD offers opportunities to identify goals for patient education and self-management. Inviting patients to draw their illness is an innovative and promising approach to assessing PRO. ? 2017 Kaptein et al.",COPD; Drawings; Illness perceptions; PRO; Quality of life; Self-management,"adult; aged; Article; attitude to illness; Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; data base; drawing; female; human; lung; major clinical study; male; outpatient; patient attitude; patient selection; patient-reported outcome; questionnaire; scoring system; art; attitude to health; chronic obstructive lung disease; cost of illness; factual database; feasibility study; imagination; lung; pathology; pathophysiology; patient; patient-reported outcome; predictive value; psychology; quality of life; reproducibility; Aged; Art; Cost of Illness; Databases, Factual; Feasibility Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Imagination; Lung; Male; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patients; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85035052293

Materials and Methods: Subjects underwent comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including keratometry. Mutational analysis of ADAMTSL4 and P3H2 was undertaken using PCR, high resolution melting analysis, and sequencing. The frequency of c.2237G>A; p.(Arg746His) was determined in an unaffected Polynesian cohort. Haplotype analysis used tagged single nucleotide polymorphic markers. Results: Mutational analysis of ADAMTSL4 identified two pathogenic variants in ADAMTSL4 in 11/31 (35%) probands, consistent with the autosomal recessive EL phenotype. A recurrent, rare missense variant in ADAMTSL4, c.2237G>A; p.(Arg746His), was present in 10 probands –(8 homozygotes), predominantly of Polynesian descent, and all shared the same haplotype. p.(Arg746His) affects the Thrombospondin1 (TSP1) domain of the protein and is predicted to be pathogenic. No pathogenic variants in P3H2 were identified. Conclusion: A recurrent pathogenic ADAMTSL4 variant is a major cause of early onset autosomal recessive EL in a Cook Island M?ori population and associated with a common haplotype, suggesting a founder effect. Children presenting under the age of 5 years, particularly of Cook Island or New Zealand M?ori descent, with isolated ectopia lentis, should in the first instance be tested for this single variant. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis.",ADAMTSL4; ectopia lentis; Marfan syndrome,"ADAMTS protein; ADAMTSL4 protein; thrombospondin 1; unclassified drug; ADAMTS protein; ADAMTSL4 protein, human; LEPREL1 protein, human; procollagen proline 2 oxoglutarate 4 dioxygenase; Article; bioinformatics; child; clinical article; controlled study; ectopia lentis; father; female; gene frequency; genetic algorithm; genetic variability; haplotype; high resolution melting analysis; human; keratometry; lens subluxation; male; missense mutation; mother; mutational analysis; pathogenicity; phenotype; polymerase chain reaction; Polynesian; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; vision; cohort analysis; dna mutational analysis; ectopia lentis; founder effect; genetics; mutation; New Zealand; pedigree; Polynesia; single nucleotide polymorphism; ADAMTS Proteins; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; DNA Mutational Analysis; Ectopia Lentis; Female; Founder Effect; Haplotypes; Humans; Male; Mutation; New Zealand; Pedigree; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Polynesia; Procollagen-Proline Dioxygenase; Prospective Studies",2-s2.0-85017205390

A total of 20 informants were interviewed using semi-structured Talanoa methods. Informants held professional roles in the mental health, social and addiction sectors in Auckland, (female, n = 10, male, n = 10). DSH was defined as an intentional act of inflicting harm to the physical, mental or spiritual self, and served separate functions from suicidal intent. DSH was defined to include both direct self-harm, as well as indirect forms of self-harm over time including, alcohol and drug misuse, gambling, self-starvation and risk taking behaviours. Intentional harm to the spiritual or the mental self included deliberate disconnection from spiritual faith and holding adverse perspectives and worldviews. Conclusion: Based on the findings it is recommended that a) DSH may be acknowledged as a behaviour that can be separated from suicide in terms of functionality, b) the present clinical DSH diagnosis criteria should include Pacific definitions of DSH, c) best-practice clinical treatment guidelines should accordingly be reviewed to incorporate treatment that encapsulate DSH behaviours relevant to Pacific people, and finally, d) researchers need to adopt operational definitions that reflects Pacific conceptualisations of DSH when conducting studies with Pacific communities in New Zealand. ?

METHODS: All tertiary institutions providing training for medicine, nursing, midwifery, dentistry, pharmacy, physiotherapy, dietetics and 11 other allied health professions in New Zealand were contacted and a person with relevant curriculum knowledge was invited to participate. Interviews were conducted using a semi-structured interview guide to explore nine quality and safety domains; improvement science, patient safety, quality and safety culture, evidence-based practice, patient-centred care, teamwork and communication, leadership for change, systems thinking and use of information technology (IT). Transcribed data were extracted and categorised by discipline and domain. Two researchers independently identified and categorised themes within each domain, using a general inductive approach. RESULTS: Forty-nine institutions were contacted and 43 (88%) people were interviewed. The inclusion and extent of quality and safety teaching was variable. Evidence-based practice, patient-centred care and teamwork and communication were the strongest domains and well embedded in programmes, while leadership, systems thinking and the role of IT were less explicitly included. Except for two institutions, improvement science was absent from pre-registration curricula. Patient safety teaching was focused mainly around incident reporting, and to a lesser extent learning from adverse events. Although a ‘no blame’ culture was articulated as important, the theme of individual accountability was still apparent. While participants agreed that all domains were important, the main barriers to incorporating improvement science and patient safety concepts into existing programmes included an ‘already stretched curriculum’ and having faculty with limited expertise in these areas. CONCLUSIONS: Although the building blocks for improving the quality and safety of healthcare are present, this national study of multiple health professional pre-registration education programmes has identified teaching gaps in patient safety and improvement science methods and tools. Failure to address these gaps will compromise the ability of new graduates to successfully implement and sustain improvements. ?

Slavery in New Zealand has most recently been associated with the fishing and horticulture industries. However, victims may be found in a number of other industry sectors, including the health and aged-care sectors, or outside of the labour market such as in forced, early (underage) and servile forms of marriage. Victims of slavery are at increased risk of acute and chronic health problems, injuries from dangerous working and living conditions, and physical and sexual abuse. These issues are compounded by restricted access to high-quality healthcare. Slavery is a violation of many human rights, including the right to health. New Zealand has obligations under international law to ensure that all victims of slavery have access to adequate physical and psychological care. The health sector has opportunities to identify, intervene and protect victims. This requires doctors and other health practitioners to demonstrate their leadership, knowledge and commitment towards addressing slavery and its health consequences in ways that are effective and do not cause further harm. Key recommendations for a safe approach towards identifying and managing people in situations of slavery include building rapport, and culturally competent practice with an empathetic non-judgmental approach. We also recommend that health organisations and regulatory and professional bodies develop culturally competent guidelines to respond safely to those identified in situations of slavery. These responses should be based on the respect, promotion and protection of human rights, and occur within a robust person-centric coordinated government response to addressing slavery in New Zealand. ?

Method: Our sample consisted of 1,036 undergraduate students at a university in Hawai'i and the survey was conducted in 2012-2013. The sample was composed of 55% women and the average age was 21. The students reported their racial/ethnic backgrounds as White (19%), Japanese (21%), Filipino (16%), Chinese (10%), Native Hawaiian (14%), Pacific Islander (4%), other Asian (6%), and other race/ethnicity (10%). Results: Interaction effect results revealed that Whites who had experienced everyday discrimination had higher levels of psychological distress than racial ethnic minorities. Women who had experienced everyday discrimination were more distressed than men and more distressed by a lower threshold level of discrimination. Furthermore, those who had lived in Hawai'i for a longer duration and experienced everyday discrimination were more distressed. Conclusions: Our findings draw attention to how the psychological effects of discrimination vary by racial/ethnic group, gender, and location in the United States. The relationship between everyday discrimination and higher levels of psychological distress especially among those who have lived in Hawai'i longer, women, and Whites indicates that targeted medical and social interventions are needed to protect the mental health of college students. ? 2017 American Psychological Association.",Discrimination; Gender; Hawai'i; Psychological distress; Race/ethnicity,adult; Article; Asian; Caucasian; Chinese; controlled study; demography; distress syndrome; ethnic difference; female; Filipino (citizen); Hawaii; human; Japanese (people); male; Native Hawaiian; Pacific Islander; perceptive discrimination; race difference; sex difference; United States; young adult; Asian continental ancestry group; depression; ethnic group; Oceanic ancestry group; prejudice; psychology; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Depression; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Hawaii; Humans; Male; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Prejudice; United States; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85014585316

Findings from animal studies have proposed underlying mechanisms including increased activation of the renin-angiotensin system, increased blood pressure, insulin resistance and chronic low-grade inflammation. However, human studies are limited by confounders arising from heterogeneous samples of participants. We examined the relationship between 25(OH)D and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in a predominantly obese otherwise healthy and drug-naive population with no history of chronic kidney disease (CKD). One hundred and twenty one non-diabetic (75 g oral glucose tolerance test; OGTT) volunteers (70 males and 51 females), aged 18–57 years participated in the study. Median 25(OH)D level was 37 nmol/L with no difference by sex. Twenty six participants (21.5%) had 25(OH)D &lt;25 nmol/L, 75 participants (62%) had 25(OH)D of 25–49.99 nmol/L, and 20 participants (16.5%) had 25(OH)D ?50 nmol/L. In univariate analysis, 25(OH)D was related negatively to percent body fat and 2-h glucose level post OGTT. Mean (SD) eGFR was 113.1 (14.9) mL/min/1.73 m2, and in the multivariable analysis, it was related to age, sex, percent body fat and 2-h glucose level post OGTT, but not to 25(OH)D. Furthermore, there was no relationship between eGFR and 25(OH)D across BMI categories. Our data suggest that measuring 25(OH)D in predominantly obese otherwise healthy individuals with no history of CKD may not be beneficial in early recognition of kidney disease. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",25(OH)D; Chronic kidney disease; Glomerular filtration rate; Healthy population; Vitamin D,"25 hydroxyvitamin D; cholesterol; glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; vitamin D; adult; age; Article; body fat; body mass; cholesterol blood level; diastolic blood pressure; diet restriction; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; gender; glucose blood level; human; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oral glucose tolerance test; systolic blood pressure; triacylglycerol blood level; vitamin blood level; waist circumference; waist hip ratio; young adult; adolescent; analogs and derivatives; blood; chronic kidney failure; complication; glomerulus filtration rate; obesity; pathophysiology; vitamin D deficiency; Adolescent; Adult; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85001760492

There is no data about the optimal way to present information about projected survival to patients with ESRD. In other areas, graphs have been shown to be more easily understood than narrative. We examined patient comprehension and perspectives on graphs in communicating projected survival in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Methods: One hundred seventy-seven patients with CKD were shown 4 different graphs presenting post transplantation survival data. Patients were asked to interpret a Kaplan Meier curve, pie chart, histogram and pictograph and answer a multi-choice question to determine understanding. Results: We measured interpretation, usefulness and preference for the graphs. Most patients correctly interpreted the graphs. There was asignificant difference in the percentage of correct answers when comparing different graph types (p = 0.0439). The pictograph was correctly interpreted by 81% of participants, the histogram by 79%, pie chart by 77% and Kaplan Meier by 69%. Correct interpretation of the histogram was associated with educational level (p = 0.008) and inversely associated with age > 65 (p = 0.008). Of those who interpreted all four graphs correctly, there was an association with employment (p = 0.001) and New Zealand European ethnicity (p = 0.002). 87% of patients found the graphs useful. The pie chart was the most preferred graph (p 0.002). The readability of the graphs may have been improved with an alternative colour choice, especially in the setting of visual impairment.

The aim of this study was to estimate the annual incidence of patients with palliative care need presenting to EDs. Methods: Retrospective case review study across two New Zealand emergency departments from 1 July 2010 to 30 June 2011. We used a two-step process where (1) administrative databases were screened for patients who had presented with 12 diseases associated with palliative care need and (2) the Gold Standard Framework Prognostic Indicator Guidance (GSF PIG) criteria were applied to the clinical records of a random sample of patients meeting the disease criterion. Results: Fifty-three thousand and fifty-seven patients presented to the EDs; 4488 (8.5%) patients had diagnostic codes indicating potential palliative care need and 1024 were randomly sampled. One hundred and eighty-eight patients (18.4%, 95%CI 16.0–20.8%) from the random sample were identified as meeting GSF PIG criteria for palliative care need. The leading diseases were cancer (26.1%), COPD (26.1%) and heart failure (22.9%). Extrapolating from the estimated incidence, 826 of the 4488 patients with 12 diseases would have met GSF PIG criteria, suggesting only 1.6% of all patients presenting to ED meet GSF PIG criteria. Conclusions: The incidence of patients with actual palliative care need presenting to EDs was lower than anticipated. Further research is needed to examine for secular trends in palliative care presentations and if the incidence rates are consistent in across ED settings. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Emergency services; Hospitals; Incidence; Palliative care; Secondary care,adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; chronic obstructive lung disease; dementia; emergency ward; female; human; ICD-10; incidence; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; medical record; motor neuron disease; multiple sclerosis; pain; palliative therapy; Parkinson disease; secondary care center; very elderly,2-s2.0-85028541922

Historians of psychiatry have understood the Claybury laboratory as a predecessor of the Maudsley Hospital in London: not only was this laboratory closed when the Maudsley was opened in 1916, but its director, Frederick Walker Mott, a champion of the ‘German’ model in psychiatry, was instrumental in the establishment of this institution. Yet, as I argue in this essay, for all the continuities with the Maudsley, the Claybury laboratory should not be seen solely as its predecessor – or as a British answer to continental laboratories such as Theodor Meynert’s in Vienna. Rather, as I show using the examples of general paralysis of the insane and ‘asylum colitis’, the Claybury laboratory is best understood as an attempt to prevent mental illness using a microbiological model. ? 2017, ?

Propriospinal excitability was assessed by suppression of background electromyography (EMG) in extensor carpi radialis (ECR) from electrical stimulation of the superficial radial nerve during bilateral (Experiment 1 and 2) or unilateral (Experiment 2 only) activation of the left and/or right ECR. EMG suppression could be attributed to an early propriospinal component and late cortical component. Motor evoked potentials (MEP) were obtained as a manipulation check. Results Before tDCS, propriospinal-mediated cutaneous-induced suppression was present in each arm for early and late components. ECR MEP amplitude increased after 1?mA, but not 2?mA, a-tDCS.

Susceptibility to misalignment of circadian rhythms may be partly genetically influenced and effects on sleep quality and duration could predispose to poorer health outcomes. Shorter sleep duration is associated with obesity traits, which are brought on by an increased opportunity to eat and/or a shift of hormonal profile promoting hunger. We hypothesised that increased sleep duration will offset susceptible genetic effects, resulting in reduced obesity risk. Methods We recruited 643 (male: 338; female: 305) European children born to participants in the New Zealand centre of the International Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints sleep study. Ten genes directly involved in the circadian rhythm machinery and a further 20 genes hypothesised to be driven by cyclic oscillations were evaluated by Sequenom assay. Multivariable regression was performed to test the interaction between gene variants and average sleep length (derived from actigraphy), in relation to obesity traits (body mass index (BMI) z-scores and percentage body fat (PBF)). Results No association was found between average sleep length and BMI z-scores (p = 0.056) or PBF (p = 0.609). Uncorrected genotype associations were detected between STAT-rs8069645 (p = 0.0052) and ADIPOQ-rs266729 (p = 0.019) with differences in average sleep duration.

While supplementary humidification is often used for symptom relief, the cause(s) of nasal drying symptoms remains speculative. Recent investigations have found augmented air pressure affects airway surface liquid (ASL) supply and inter-nasal airflow apportionment. However the influence these two factors have on ASL hydration is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine how ASL supply and airflow apportionment affect ASL hydration status for both ambient and pressurised air breathing conditions. This is done by modifying and adapting a nasal air-conditioning and ASL supply model. Model predictions of change in inter-nasal airflow apportionment closely follow in-vivo results and demonstrate for the first time abnormal ASL dehydration occurring during augmented pressure breathing.

Mandibular PGLs hitherto reported in literature are malignant metastatic lesions, mostly from a pheochromocytoma. Methods: We report a case of mandibular lytic lesion in a young female with multifocal PGLs but no family history of PGLs. We also performed a literature search to identify published cases of mandibular PGL. Results: Lack of established criteria for malignancy in a PGL made diagnosis and treatment challenging. Testing was negative for a pheochromocytoma and positive for mutation of succinate dehydrogenase gene encoding subunit D (SDHD), thus rendering a diagnosis of familial PGL syndrome type I. Due to the absence of prior published reports of nonmalignant, primary mandibular PGL, patient was treated with surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Our literature search revealed 4 published cases of mandibular PGL, all of which had an osteoblastic appearance and were malignant. Conclusions: Isolated mandibular PGL does not always indicate a malignant metastatic lesion. Genetic testing is recommended in patients with early onset of PGL and/or multifocality even without a positive family history. Surgical resection alone with surveillance can be offered for such isolated lesions in the presence of familial PGL syndrome type I. ?

Recent data from multicentre clinical trials, quality observational studies and consensus documents have influenced management in this area, and is important to both pre-hospital providers and emergency physicians. The objective of this review was to: (i) present an overview of the available evidence relevant to pre-hospital care of paediatric SE; and (ii) assess the current pre-hospital practice guidelines in Australia and New Zealand. The review outlines current definitions and guidelines of SE management, regional variability in pre-hospital protocols within Australasia and aspects of pre-hospital care that could potentially be improved. Contemporary data is required to determine current practice in our setting.

Conventional cytogenetic analyses are a mandatory component of AML diagnostics but they are time-consuming; therefore, therapeutic decisions in elderly patients are often delayed. We investigated whether a screening approach using a panel of seven fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) probes would allow rapid identification of adverse chromosomal changes. In a cohort of 334 AML patients, our targeted FISH screening approach identified 80% of adverse risk AML patients with a specificity of 99%. Incorporating FISH screening into diagnostic workup has the potential to accelerate risk stratification and treatment selection, particularly in older patients.

We aimed to categorize self-reported foot complaints in people with SLE and foot symptoms. Methods: A self-administered validated questionnaire was posted to 406 people with SLE attending adult rheumatology clinics across three health boards in Auckland, New Zealand. In addition to foot pain, vascular complaints, dermatological lesions and neurological symptoms were included in the analysis. Pairwise correlations among the variables were undertaken followed by factor analysis to identify and categorise associations between reported foot complaints. Results: From the questionnaires returned, 93 full datasets were analysed. Participants' were predominantly female (n=87, 93.7%), with mean (SD) age of 50.4 (14.3) years and a mean (SD) disease duration of 13.1 (11) years. Three categories of foot complaint were determined: 'foot pain', 'skin disorders' and 'vascular insufficiency'. These three groups provided the best fit (0.91) to describe the wide range of foot complaints reported by those with SLE. Factor analysis for foot pain demonstrated a high positive loading for the inter-correlation of foot pain in past month (0.83), foot pain today (0.71), intermittent claudication (0.71), numbness (0.62), loss of balance (0.81), swelling (0.59), foot joint pain (0.77), arch pain (0.68) and tendon pain (0.77). Skin disorders demonstrated a very high positive loading for 3 factors skin rash (0.82), blistering skin rash (0.95) and foot ulceration (0.88). In vascular insufficiency a high positive loading for cold feet (0.83), chilblains (0.76) and Raynaud's phenomenon (0.70).

Part of this increase has been patient-driven for quality of life reasons. More recently, bioprosthetic valves have been chosen by progressively younger patients, with a strategy of performing a valve-in-valve TAVI if the prosthesis should wear out. Thus, a review was undertaken of the present authors' experience with patients whose first two aortic valve replacements (AVRs) were with bioprosthetic valves.METHODS: Patients receiving consecutive bioprosthetic AVRs at the Green Lane Cardiothoracic Surgical Unit were identified from a departmental database. Data were retrieved from prospective databases, electronic and archived clinical records. Outcomes of interest were overall survival and freedom from a third or more AVR.RESULTS: A total of 267 patients met the inclusion criteria, with a mean follow up of 22.3 years. Concurrent procedures (e.g., coronary artery bypass grafting) were performed in 65.2% of patients that underwent two bioprosthetic AVRs, and in 79.8% of patients undergoing three or more bioprosthetic AVRs. Median survival of the cohort was 31.7 years. Age at operation was the best predictor of needing a third or more AVR. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified that age <45 years at the first operation and <56 years at the second operation were the optimal cut-off point for the likelihood of needing a third or more aortic valve intervention.CONCLUSIONS: Overall survival for consecutive bioprosthetic AVRs was remarkably good. Data relating to consecutive bioprosthetic AVRs is of particular interest in the context of TAVI and valve-in-valve TAVI, which will likely significantly increase the number of patients receiving consecutive bioprosthetic valves. However, it must be noted that the majority of patients in this cohort required concurrent cardiac surgical procedures. The study results provided encouraging data for consecutive bioprosthetic AVRs, as well as data that may be of interest in the setting of TAVI being performed in younger cohorts of patients.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; aortic valve; bioprosthesis; child; devices; disease free survival; factual database; female; heart valve prosthesis; heart valve replacement; human; Kaplan Meier method; male; middle aged; New Zealand; pathophysiology; predictive value; preschool child; prosthesis design; reoperation; retrospective study; risk factor; surgery; time factor; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aortic Valve; Bioprosthesis; Child; Child, Preschool; Databases, Factual; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Predictive Value of Tests; Prosthesis Design; Reoperation; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85049252874

This problem reflects the complex pathophysiology of OD as well as health service delivery factors. This study aimed to identify the factors that act as a barrier to effective management of OD as perceived by specialist colorectal surgeons treating this disorder. Method: A postal questionnaire was administered to a bi-national sampling of colorectal specialists in Australia and New Zealand who were registered with their specialty society. Questions addressed variables relevant in OD management, including clinical access, decision-making, patient factors and surgeon experience and perceptions, and used Likert scales. Statistical analyses compared surgeon practice variables. Results: The response rate was 68.5% (n?=?113). Most surgeons managed OD (94%), and preferred to treat OD patients themselves (87%); however, 33% of these respondents were dissatisfied with their management, 46% felt they lacked management expertise and 33% stated they had inadequate expertise in OD investigations. Clinical investigation services were more limited in private than public practice, and many surgeons lacked access to biofeedback (31%). Other barriers included heterogeneity in decision-making by surgeon age and practice location (P?<?0.05), dual pathologies (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome) and psychological factors, and limited uptake of multidisciplinary services and standardized (Rome) diagnostic criteria. Conclusion: Barriers to OD management include surgeon-specific factors, patient-specific factors and healthcare access factors. Increased utilization of pelvic floor and multidisciplinary services, increased training and standardization of OD investigations and improved access to specialist investigations and allied-health management services could improve outcomes for OD.

Currently, the only way to treat cataracts is by surgery. However, with an aging population and the increasing prevalence of diabetes, the demand for cataract surgery and the need for cost-effective solutions are growing. To reduce the need for cataract surgery, alternative medical therapies to delay cataracts are required. However, given the difficulty in accessing intact human cataractous lenses, due to new cataract procedures that result in phacoemulsification of the lenses, understanding the pathogenesis of this disease and testing the efficacy of potential therapies in humans is problematic. Therefore, researchers have tried to create suitable animal models of cataract to identify therapeutic options. Here we provide an overview of the two most common types of cataract: age-related nuclear cataract and diabetic cataract, with a specific focus on diabetic cataract and diabetic cataract animal models. Early studies using diabetic animal models provided us with extensive knowledge of the polyol pathway and the role of aldose reductase and sorbitol accumulation in the initiation of osmotic stress. However, the inability of aldose reductase inhibitors to ameliorate cataracts in humans, as it did in rats, highlights the importance of selecting appropriate animal models that mimic the human condition. To facilitate the researcher with this, we describe key changes to the diabetic cataractous lens in terms of lens physiology, cellular structure, and biochemistry. Using this set of human lens parameters, we then assess existing animal cataract models and their suitability for mimicking the processes associated with the development of diabetic cataract in humans and for testing of potential therapeutic interventions that are can be translated and effective in humans. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Vitamin D deficiency has been suggested to play a role in the etiology of psychotic disorders. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the association between sun exposure and psychotic experiences (PEs) in a general population sample of Swedish women. Methods: The study population included participants from The Swedish Women-s Lifestyle and Health cohort study. The 20-item community assessment of psychic experiences (CAPEs) was administered between ages 30 and 50 to establish PEs. Sun exposure as measured by (1) sunbathing holidays and (2) history of sunburn was measured between ages 10 and 39. The association between sun exposure and PEs was evaluated by quantile regression models. Results: 34,297 women were included in the analysis. Women who reported no sunbathing holidays and 2 or more weeks of sunbathing holidays scored higher on the CAPE scale than women exposed to 1 week of sunbathing holidays across the entire distribution, when adjusting for age and education. Similarly, compared with women who reported a history of one sunburn, the women with none or two or more sunburns showed higher scores on the CAPE scale. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that, in a population-based cohort of middle aged women, both low and high sun exposure is associated with increased level of positive PEs. ? 2017 Pilecka, Sandin, Reichenberg, Scragg, David and Weiderpass.",Community assessment of psychic experiences; Epidemiology; Psychosis; Sunlight; UV,adult; age; Article; disease association; education; female; human; leisure; personal experience; psychosis; sun exposure; sunbathing; sunburn; Swedish citizen; women's health,2-s2.0-85021692954

The primary aim of this study was to determine patient persistence to antibiotic treatment for group A streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis in patients presenting with sore throat to the Whangarei Hospital Emergency Department. Secondarily, this study sought to determine prescriber adherence to the national antibiotic guideline for sore throat management. METHOD: A retrospective audit of patients presenting to ED with presumed GAS pharyngitis between 1 May 2016 and 31 August 2016 was carried out. Data on patient demographics, clinical examination findings, investigations and antibiotic prescription were extracted from electronic medical records. Patients were contacted and after obtaining consent, were asked about their antibiotic treatment using a standardised telephone interview script. RESULTS: The patient population audited reflects those at high risk for acute rheumatic fever. All patients were discharged on the recommended medication, but only 82.7% (62/75) received the correct length (10 days) of oral antibiotics. Of the total of 75 patients audited, 61 (81%) had a swab taken and 41% (25/61) of these were confirmed positive for GAS. Patients were either advised to commence medication without waiting for a swab result (96%, 72/75) or delay treatment and commence only if no improvement in symptoms (4%, 3/75). Of those advised to commence medication immediately, 94% (67/72) obtained their medication from a community pharmacy. Three patients were advised to stop treatment after confirmation of a negative result. Of those patients assessable for medication persistence (n=65), 73.8% (48/65) of patients were compliant in completing the full course of antibiotic therapy. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to assess patient persistence to an antibiotic course for GAS after presentation at an emergency department in Northland and possibly New Zealand. The results indicate a relatively high persistence rate with oral antibiotic treatment by patients treated for suspected GAS pharyngitis. An important finding is that community pharmacy dispensing does not appear to be a major barrier to patients acquiring medications. Additionally, the study shows low levels of follow up of patients with negative throat swab results, resulting in these patients completing the course of antibiotics unnecessarily. ?

This study aimed to translate best practices from high performing general practices into strategies to improve childhood immunisation coverage among low performing practices. Methods: An intervention study was undertaken of general practices with low immunisation coverage rates and a high percentage of the enrolled population being of Maori ethnicity. Intervention groups received customised action plans and support for a 12 month period while control groups received 'business as usual' support. Structured interviews were conducted with key informants from all participating practices to understand current aspects related to childhood immunisation delivery and surveys were conducted to understand how the intervention worked. Collected data were thematically analysed. Results: Ten sites were randomised to either intervention (n = 6) or control group (n = 4). Positive aspects of childhood immunisation delivery included high prioritisation at the practice and staff being pro-immunisation and knowledgeable. Key challenges experienced included inaccurate family contact information and discrepancies with referral processes to other providers. Other challenges noted were building rapport with families and vaccine hesitancy. The action plans included various strategies aimed to improve processes at the practice, contact and engagement with parents, and partnership development with local service providers. Conclusions: Creating customised action plans and providing support to providers were considered as helpful approaches when attempting to improve childhood immunisation coverage rates. Our study supports the notion that one strategy will not solely by itself improve childhood immunisation rates and highlights the importance of having a toolkit of strategies from which to draw from. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Immunisation; Nursing; Paediatrics; Practice management; Primary care; Quality of care,,2-s2.0-85020402201

Over the past 30?years, it has become clear that control of body weight is as simple as matching energy intake to expenditure, yet how to achieve this in the current obesigenic environment is far from simple. A review of causative mechanisms shows controlling eating behaviour and food intake as central to regulation of body weight, but in an environment where the need to suppress intake is uppermost, there are few physiological mechanisms with which to tackle this. Recent Findings: Macronutrient composition, energy density, food format (beverages), palatability, portion size and hedonics all influence intake and readily promote overeating. Currently, the most successful obesity treatment is restrictive bariatric surgery, both invasive and expensive, achieving better outcomes than diet and exercise. Despite considerable advances, there remains a critical gap in translation of underpinning knowledge into successful public health outcomes, as recently outlined in the 2nd Lancet series in obesity with no country reporting decreased obesity prevalence in the last 30?years. Summary: Future contribution may come from better understanding of mechanisms including gut-brain axis and regulation of appetite, the gut microbiome and the genetic underpinning of bodyweight control. Clearly, prevention is the key, with nutrition education required to lead changes in behaviour, and possibly the only viable long-term approach. Whether the global obesity trend can be reversed without significant change in national food policies and/or the built environment however is under debate, and without doubt a major public health challenge for tomorrow if there is to be light at the end of the obesity tunnel. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Appetite; Built environment; Energy density; Obesity; Plate size; Portion size; Prevention,triacylglycerol; appetite; body weight; caloric intake; energy balance; energy expenditure; feeding behavior; human; lifestyle; macronutrient; microflora; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; physical activity; priority journal; public health; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism; socioeconomics; sugar-sweetened beverage; weight control; world health organization,2-s2.0-85057637463

Several studies have implicated N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments in Huntington disease pathogenesis. Ideally, these fragments are studied in human brain tissue. However, the use of human brain tissue comes with certain unavoidable variables such as post mortem delay, artefacts from freeze-thaw cycles and subject-to-subject variation. Knowledge on how these variables might affect N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments in post mortem human brain is important for a proper interpretation of study results. The effect of post mortem delay on protein in human brain is known to vary depending on the protein of interest. In the present study, we have assessed the effect of post mortem delay on N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments using western blot. We mimicked post mortem delay in one individual control case and one individual Huntington disease case with low initial post mortem delay. The influence of subject-to-subject variation on N-terminal huntingtin fragments was assessed in human cortex and human striatum using two cohorts of control and Huntington disease subjects. Our results show that effects of post mortem delay on N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments are minor in our individual subjects. Additionally, one freeze-thaw cycle decreases the huntingtin western blot signal intensity in the cortex control subject, but does not introduce additional N-terminal huntingtin fragments. Our results suggest that subject-to-subject variation contributes more to variability in N-terminal huntingtin fragments than post mortem delay. ? 2017 Schut et al.

The relationship between plasma opioid concentration and psychomotor function in opioid-dependent patients was examined to determine whether impairment was more likely at the time of highest plasma drug concentration. Sixteen patients participating in a cross-over trial comparing methadone and LAAM completed a tracking task (OSPAT) 11 times over the dosing-interval for methadone (24-hrs) and LAAM (48-hrs). Venous blood was collected for the quantification of plasma (R)-(-)-methadone, LAAM, and nor-LAAM concentrations. The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and Trail-Making Test were administered at the time of peak plasma concentration. Ten healthy controls (HCs) also participated. OSPAT scores (obtained for 15 patients) fluctuated significantly across the dosing-interval for both drugs and were lower in patients than HCs at the times of peak concentrations of (R)-(-)-methadone (1 hr: (mean difference; 95% CI) (2.13; 0.18 -4.08); 2 hrs: (2.38; 0.48 -4.28) postdosing) and LAAM (2 hrs: (1.81; 0.09 -3.53), and 4 hrs (1.90: 0.9 -3.71) postdosing). Withinparticipant analysis of the peak-change from baseline for OSPAT scores found that 10 of the 15 patients could be categorized as impaired on methadone and 9 on LAAM. No HCs were impaired. Patients performed worse on the DSST and Trails-A than HCs, but not on Trails-B. Results suggest that some patients receiving opioids long term may exhibit impairment at the time of highest plasma drug concentration.

This unexplained category includes deaths with placental pathology even though the importance of placental pathology and its causal relationship to stillbirth is well described. Aims: To determine whether unexplained stillbirths in New Zealand classified using PSANZ criteria can be more usefully classified based on placental pathology. Methods: Audit of the classification of cause of death among ‘unexplained antepartum death’ at term by perinatal pathologist review of postmortem and/or placental pathology reports using the current PSANZ Perinatal Death Classification (PDC)10 classification and a proposed ‘significant placental pathology’ subclassification. The main outcome measure was a change in cause of death from unexplained term stillbirth to an alternative PSANZ classification or to significant placental pathology subcategory. Results: In total, 177 unexplained stillbirths with a postmortem and/or placental pathology report in New Zealand between 2007 and 2013 inclusive were reviewed. Twenty-three cases (13%) had significant placental pathology that could have been a direct cause of the stillbirth. A further seven cases (4%) were misclassified and could be better classified within another PDC category. Conclusions: A classification system incorporating placental pathologies which are recognised by the current literature to be causative of stillbirth would better describe stillbirths at term in New Zealand. This would benefit parental counselling and follow-up in subsequent pregnancies. A standard approach to reporting placental pathology would benefit clinicians. Education on placental pathology for clinicians working with parents experiencing stillbirth and multidisciplinary approach to classification is also recommended. ? 2016 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists",classification; pathology; placenta; stillbirth,antepartum hemorrhage; Article; cause of death; chorioamnionitis; classification; fetus; fetus death; gestational age; human; intrauterine growth retardation; New Zealand; pathologist; pathology; placenta; priority journal; small for date infant; stillbirth; clinical audit; etiology; female; mortality; placenta disorder; pregnancy; term birth; Cause of Death; Female; Fetal Death; Humans; Medical Audit; New Zealand; Placenta Diseases; Pregnancy; Stillbirth; Term Birth,2-s2.0-84978646160

METHODS: A retrospective review of all new patients who presented for diabetic photo-screening at the Diabetic Eye Clinic, Suva in 2010. Fundus images were graded using standardised guidelines. Patient demographics, retinopathy grading and visual acuity data were extracted from the database and analyzed. Patients that received laser therapy and still attending follow up in 2012 were examined for disease progression RESULTS: Totally 2236 patients were photo-screened, 87% (3870/4472) of images were gradable. STR was observed in 26% (988/3870) with advanced STR (proliferative retinopathy/severe maculopathy) in 10% (385/3870). Of those with STR, 59% had BCVA ?6/18, 31% with advanced STR were <6/60. Male gender [odds ratio (OR) 1.59; 1.20- 2.12], history of hypertension (OR 1.36; 1.03-1.80) and peripheral neuropathy (OR 1.41; 1.01-1.95) were predictive of advanced STR. In 2012, 32% (315/988) attended follow up with 69% exhibiting advanced STR compared with 53% of the same cohort in 2010. Laser photocoagulation was administered to 212 eyes (212/3870, 5%) with retinopathy and maculopathy progression observed in 52% and 33% respectively. BCVA ?6/18 was noted in 67% (143/212) of treated eyes. Improved glycaemic control (OR 46.52; 1.50- 1441.90) amongst those with advanced STR was predictive of eyes that maintained good vision. CONCLUSION: In Fiji, a quarter of new patients presenting to photo-screening have STR with a third of those with advanced STR having already loss vision. Improved glycaemic control and timely treatment of patients with sight threatening complications is important in halting disease progression. ? 2017, International Journal of Ophthalmology (c/o Editorial Office).

The goal of this research is to enable roboticists and non-programmer domain experts to co-develop robot service scenarios in real world environments using a visual programming environment called RoboStudio. The first key contribution of this paper is presenting the implementation architecture of RoboStudio. This is important as it serves as a case study for smaller teams with limited resources to expedite the process of building visual programming environments without the deep knowledge of frameworks and meta-modelling tools required for building complex visual environments. The second key contribution presents the model and design of components for parsing, generating, validating and visualising the RBDL. The third contribution elicits how we evaluated RoboStudio's design and functionality through code-generation of scripts for several service applications deployed in the real world on the University of Auckland's Healthbot. We also show RoboStudio's extensibility by building other visual languages on this platform. ? 2017 IEEE.",Control Architectures and Programming; Middleware and Programming Environments; Social Human-Robot Interaction; Software,Computer programming; Computer software; Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Middleware; Mobile robots; Robotics; Robots; Visual languages; Control architectures and programming; Implementation architecture; Multi-disciplinary teams; Personal service robots; Programming environment; Real world environments; Social human-robot interactions; Visual programming environments; Robot programming,2-s2.0-85020236177

Recruitment of non-radiated tissue into the surgical defect may decrease the risk of fistula. These techniques however have significant morbidity and increases operative time. We hypothesized that using acellular dermal graft to reinforce the pharyngeal closure could decrease the risk of fistula, without the added morbidity of a vascularized flap. Methods We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients that underwent a laryngectomy between 2005 and 2015 at an acedemic tertiary referral center. Patients who underwent primary pharyngeal closure with Alloderm? reinforcement without any other flap reconstruction were identified. Basic demographics, previous treatment, operative technique and fistula were extracted from the medical records. The primary outcome was PCF rate. The time to closure, margin status and disease recurrence was also evaluated. Results Among 16 patients with AlloDerm? augmentation, eight had primary laryngectomy and eight had salvage laryngectomy. A total of three in the salvage laryngectomy with prior history of radiation developed PCF. The fistula closed in all three cases with conservative treatment. There was no PCF in the primary laryngectomy group without prior history of radiation. Conclusion The rate of PCF among the salvage laryngectomy group with previous radiation did not differ from historical data. AlloDerm? can however, provide a simple alternative for repair in radiation patients where flap cannot be performed for pharyngeal reconstruction. In non-radiated patients, AlloDerm? augmentation may have a protective effect on fistula formation. ? 2017",,"antineoplastic agent; collagen; surgical mesh; acellular dermal matrix; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; conservative treatment; female; head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; human; laryngectomy; male; medical record review; pharynx reconstruction; priority journal; retrospective study; salvage therapy; skin graft; surgical margin; surgical mesh; tertiary care center; thyroid papillary carcinoma; follow up; laryngectomy; middle aged; pharynx; pharynx cancer; postoperative complication; procedures; reconstructive surgery; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Collagen; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Laryngectomy; Male; Middle Aged; Pharyngeal Neoplasms; Pharynx; Postoperative Complications; Reconstructive Surgical Procedures; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85011990211

We critically explore the collaborative process we undertook in framing the research context and discuss the rewards and challenges that emerged. METHOD: The research this critical discussion draws on undertook a qualitative Kaupapa M?ori consistent research approach and drew on the principles of an Interface Research approach. The paper focuses on the collaborative approach taken between the 10 researchers involved in the study. RESULTS: Challenges identified within the collaborative Kaupapa M?ori consistent research process included: determining appropriate authority and representation of researchers and participants; maintaining clear communication; time and logistical management. The key strengths that emerged from this research design were: establishing a culturally safe and robust research process; an ability to build and maintain relationships between researchers and participants; and the opportunity to develop academic research skills between researchers and participants. CONCLUSION: Collaborative Kaupapa M?ori consistent research approaches to research can enable accountability, control and representation throughout the entire research process. Given the rich research results achieved and personal rewards gained from this study design, we would advocate for the application of such approaches within health research contexts. ?

This paper reports on the quantitative evaluation of the knowledge-broking intervention through assessment of participants' perceptions of evidence use and development of policy/advocacy briefs. Methods: Selected staff from six organizations - four government Ministries and two nongovernment organizations (NGOs) - participated in the project. The intervention comprised workshops and supported development of policy/advocacy briefs. Workshops addressed obesity and policy cycles and developing participants' skills in accessing, assessing, adapting and applying relevant evidence. A knowledge-broking team supported participants individually and/or in small groups to develop evidence-informed policy/advocacy briefs. A questionnaire survey that included workplace and demographic items and the self-assessment tool ""Is Research Working for You?"" (IRWFY) was administered pre- and post-intervention. Results: Forty nine individuals (55% female, 69% 21-40 years, 69% middle-senior managers) participated in the study. The duration and level of participant engagement with the intervention activities varied - just over half participated for 10+ months, just under half attended most workshops and approximately one third produced one or more policy briefs. There were few reliable changes on the IRWFY scales following the intervention; while positive changes were found on several scales, these effects were small (d <.2) and only one individual scale (assess) was statistically significant (p <.05). Follow up (N = 1) analyses of individual-level change indicated that while 63% of participants reported increased research utilization post-intervention, this proportion was not different to chance levels. Similar analysis using scores aggregated by organization also revealed no organizational-level change post-intervention. Conclusions: This study empirically evaluated a knowledge-broking program that aimed to extend evidence-informed policy making skills and development of a suite of national policy briefs designed to increase the enactment of obesity-related policies. The findings failed to indicate reliable improvements in research utilization at either the individual or organizational level. Factors associated with fidelity and intervention dose as well as challenges related to organizational support and the measurement of research utilization, are discussed and recommendations for future research presented. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Evidence-informed policy making; Fiji; Knowledge-broking; Obesity,adult; evidence based medicine; female; Fiji; human; knowledge; male; management; obesity; organization; organization and management; program evaluation; translational research; Adult; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Fiji; Humans; Knowledge; Male; Obesity; Organizations; Policy Making; Program Evaluation; Translational Medical Research,2-s2.0-85018178405

These effects can be exacerbated via exposure to an obesogenic dietary environment. To date, the effect of maternal diet and/or a post-natal obesogenic nutritional environment on key characteristics related to lens growth and oxidative stress has not been undertaken. The present study, therefore, examined the characteristics and oxidative status of the lens. Materials and Methods: Using a model of moderate maternal under-nutrition, rat dams were fed either a control diet (100% ad libitum, CON) or undernourished throughout pregnancy (50% of ad libitum intake, UN) and offspring fed either a control (5% fat, C) or high fat (30% fat, HF) diet post-weaning, resulting in four nutritional groups; CON-C, CON-HF, UN-C, and UN-HF. Offspring lenses were extracted at 160 days of age, weighed, imaged under dark and bright field microscopy, and then dissected into cortical and core fractions for biochemical analyses of oxidative stress markers. Results: Our findings reveal that lenses from all groups were transparent. However, gender specific changes were evident at the biochemical level with increased oxidative stress detected in the cortex and core of female but not male UN-C lenses, and in the cortex of male but not female CON-HF lenses. The greatest increase in oxidative stress was detected in the UN-HF group in the cortex and core regions of the lens and for both genders. Conclusions: These findings show that oxidative stress is exacerbated in the lens as a result of a combination of altered pre-natal and post-natal diet. This demonstrates a novel interaction between the two developmental windows and warrants further investigations toward devising appropriate nutritional strategies for minimizing oxidative stress in the lens. ? 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Cataract; oxidative stress; post-natal nutrition; pre-natal nutrition,"carbonyl derivative; alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; biological marker; glucose blood level; glutathione; insulin; leptin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; Article; bright field microscopy; clinical assessment; controlled study; female; hyperinsulinemia; hyperleptinemia; lens; lipid diet; lipid peroxidation; male; malnutrition; maternal nutrition; nonhuman; obesity; oxidative stress; postnatal growth; pregnancy; priority journal; progeny; rat; tissue preparation; weight gain; adverse effects; animal; blood; body weight; complication; glucose blood level; growth, development and aging; lens; Lens Diseases; lipid diet; malnutrition; metabolism; obesity; physiology; Sprague Dawley rat; Adiposity; Animals; Ascorbic Acid; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Body Weight; Diet, High-Fat; Female; Glutathione; Insulin; Lens Diseases; Lens, Crystalline; Leptin; Male; Malnutrition; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Pregnancy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Vitamin E",2-s2.0-84986239376

This network has established a cohort of self- and proxy-reported individuals and their family members with ASD in New Zealand. The aim of this manuscript is to present the New Zealand Minds for Minds Autism Spectrum Disorder Self-Reported Cohort, M4M cohort for short, and to provide preliminary insights into the trends of ASD in New Zealand through the analysis of diagnostic and sociodemographic information of 972 members (ages 2–83) of this cohort, the majority of which were carer-reported. Method The participants were recruited via an internet-based questionnaire, and social network analysis was used to visually analyse the mutual interactions of the cohort. Results We observed the well-reported gender bias and an ethnic structure that reflects New Zealand's most recent census. Comorbidity patterns were consistent with epidemiological literature: anxiety disorders, depression and epilepsy were highly prevalent amongst individuals with ASD and their families. Conclusions This is the first national large-scale ASD research cohort, which contains an ethnic composition unique to the country. It is anticipated that the multi-disciplinary research approach of this cohort will help inform health policies in New Zealand and contribute to the international effort to better understand ASD. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Asd; Comorbidity; M4M cohort; New Zealand,adolescent; adult; aged; anxiety; anxiety disorder; Article; Asperger syndrome; autism; child; comorbidity; data base; depression; epilepsy; female; gender bias; health care policy; human; Internet; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; obsessive compulsive disorder; priority journal; questionnaire; self report; social network,2-s2.0-85009982916

In this paper, a new technique is proposed to augment the residual ability of physically impaired patients with a robotic rehabilitation exoskeleton, such that motor learning can be studied independently of physical impairment. The proposed technique augments the velocity of an on-screen cursor relative to the restricted physical motion. Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) are used to both model velocity and derive a function to scale velocity as a function of workspace position. Two variations of the algorithm are presented for comparison. In a cross-over pilot study, healthy participants were recruited and subjected to a simulated impairment to constrain their motion, imposed by the cable-driven wrist exoskeleton. Participants then completed a sinusoidal tracking task, in which the algorithms were statistically shown to augment the cursor velocity in the constrained state such that it matched position-dependent velocities recorded in the healthy state. A kinematic task was then designed as a motor-learning case study where the algorithms were statistically shown to allow participants to achieve the same performance when their motion was constrained as when unconstrained. The results of the pilot study provide motivation for further research into the use of this technique, thus providing a tool with which motor-learning can be studied in neurologically impaired populations. This could be used to give physiotherapists greater insight into underlying causes of motor learning deficits, consequently facilitating and enhancing subject-specific therapy regimes. ? 2017 Jarrett and McDaid.",Biomechatronics; Motor learning; Rehabilitation robotics; Robotic assessment; Virtual normalization,adult; algorithm; Article; body position; clinical research; controlled study; crossover procedure; exoskeleton (rehabilitation); female; human; human experiment; kinematics; male; mathematical parameters; motor learning; normal human; physical disease; physical parameters; physiotherapist; pilot study; radial basis functions; robotics; scale velocity; simulation; task performance; velocity; wrist,2-s2.0-85017124838

This study evaluates the factors associated with the selection of radial versus femoral angiography in Australia and New Zealand and the effect of access site on clinical events in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. Methods An analysis of the SNAPSHOT ACS audit was conducted during May 2012 across 286 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. Data collected included baseline patient characteristics, hospital site details, treatment received, clinical events in-hospital and mortality at 18 months. Univariate and multivariable analyses were performed. Results Of the 1621 patients undergoing coronary angiography, access was through the femoral artery in 1043 (63%), and the radial in 578 (36%) patients. Radial access dominated in New Zealand (241 out of 327, 73.7%), compared to Australia (337 out of 1293, 26.1%, p=&lt;0.001), with interstate variation (6% to 54%, p=&lt;0.001). Independent predictors of access site included country of admission (Odds of radial, Aus v NZ OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.08-0.24, p=&lt;0.0001), prior CABG surgery (OR 0.16, 95% CI 0.09-0.31, p=&lt;0.0001), high GRACE score (90th decile) (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.21-0.91, p=0.026) and admission to a centre with high annual PCI volume (&gt;209 cases per year) (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.06-3.26, p=0.03). After adjustment, there was no difference in clinical events in-hospital or mortality at 18 months Conclusion Coronary angiography in New Zealand rather than Australia is the strongest predictor of radial access in ACS patients. There was no difference in outcomes according to access site in this population based cohort study. ? 2016",Acute coronary syndromes; Coronary angiography; Femoral access; Radial access,acute coronary syndrome; aged; Article; Australia; coronary angiography; coronary artery bypass surgery; female; femoral artery; geographic distribution; hospital admission; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; mortality; New Zealand; percutaneous coronary intervention; radial artery; vascular access; acute coronary syndrome; clinical audit; clinical trial; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; multicenter study; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Aged; Australia; Coronary Angiography; Female; Femoral Artery; Humans; Male; Medical Audit; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Radial Artery,2-s2.0-85008670867

Until various component technologies for fully autonomous systems are matured for field deployment, robots need to be tasked and programmed by humans. This research aims at developing a higher layer of abstraction for programming personal service robots with applications to healthcare scenarios. The robots were used in a real world deployment scenario at an Aged Care Facility. The goal is to enable roboticists and non-programmer domain experts to co-develop robot service scenarios in real world environments and simulate execution of the behaviour without running the entire application on the robot. A domain-specific programming language (DSL) and a visual programming environment (Ro-boStudio) were developed to meet this goal. The key objective of this paper is to formalize the language specification for the DSL. It is referred to as Robot Behaviour Description Modeling Language (RBDML). The graphical meta-model for RBDML consists of two interwoven modelling languages. This formalisation allows the key concepts of the domain to be captured in a formal meta-model and keep it independent from the target language. Examples presented will give the reader a walk-through of the language definition process along with the modeling notations, syntax, semantics and validation rules. The results demonstrate the accuracy of code-generation compared with hand written code for equivalent robot service applications. ? 2016 IEEE.",,Computer aided software engineering; Computer programming; Computer programming languages; Digital subscriber lines; Mobile robots; Problem oriented languages; Robot programming; Robots; Semantics; Specifications; Visual languages; Behaviour descriptions; Component technologies; Domain specific languages; Domain specific programming languages; Language specification; Personal service robots; Real world environments; Visual programming environments; Modeling languages,2-s2.0-85015961026

METHODS: The Rules of the Health Information Privacy Code 1994 and the Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers’ Rights were applied to the taking, storing and sharing of photographic and radiological images by medical students. Stakeholders, including clinicians, medical students, lawyers at district health boards in the Auckland region, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner and the Health and Disability Commissioner were consulted and their recommendations incorporated. RESULTS: The policy ‘Taking and Sharing Images of Patients’ sets expectations of students in relation to: photographs taken for the purpose of providing care; photographs taken for educational or professional practice purposes and photographic or radiological images used for educational or professional practice purposes. In addition, it prohibits students from uploading images of patients onto image-sharing apps such as Figure 1. The policy has since been extended to apply to all students at the Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences at the University of Auckland. CONCLUSIONS: Technology-driven evolutions in practice necessitate regular review to ensure compliance with existing legal regulations and ethical frameworks. This policy offers a starting point for healthcare providers to review their own policies and practice, with a view to ensuring that patients’ trust in the treatment that their health information receives is upheld. ?

METHODS: This study draws on a survey of adults prescribed antidepressants. It analyses 1,683 responses to an open-ended question that enquired about difficult events and circumstances participants experienced in the time leading up to receiving an antidepressant prescription. RESULTS: Sixty-five percent of respondents described experiencing one or more stressful events or circumstances, with 19% reporting two and 20% reporting three or more. The most frequently reported stressors identified by participants were categorised as: relationship difficulties (19%), life transitions (19%), losses (18%), work related difficulties (15%) and participants’ own or others’ health issues (15%). Other less frequently reported stressors included isolation, academic difficulties, abuse and violence and financial difficulties. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are that stressful life events or circumstances are significant for a large number of who are given a prescription for antidepressants. It is important for GPs to be aware of significance of these psychosocial stressors in their patients’ lives and make treatment recommendations that address these difficulties.

By the nature of the services that they provide, they tend to see either people being dispensed medication to assist them to stop using illicit drugs, usually opiates, or people seeking sterile injecting equipment. However, not all illicit drug use leads to problematic drug use and dependence. The use of heroin and cocaine is, however, particularly associated with dependence. Injecting drug users (IDUs) face particular health risks and social problems. Additionally, they may be reluctant to access treatment or services. This can put pharmacists who operate needle and syringe programmes (NSPs) in a unique position, where they have regular contact with this hard-to-reach, vulnerable group. The provision of sterile injecting equipment is in itself an effective intervention to prevent blood-borne virus (BBV) spread. Additional advice and care can reduce or manage injecting-related complications, such as skin and soft-tissue infections. Signposting to specialist treatment services or general practitioners can lead to large reductions in risk to the individual and benets for the wider public, especially through crime reduction.

Aberrations in this vital structure are associated with several corneal pathologies including keratoconus. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of key structural components of the epithelial BM in keratoconic corneas and to identify and describe any aberrant patterns. Methods: Immunohistochemical labeling of key BM components including fibronectin, laminin, and type IV and VII collagen was performed in healthy and keratoconic corneas. Results: Clear changes in the BM components in the keratoconic corneas were seen with the key structural components either being absent or forming a discontinuous pattern. Another aberrant pattern, the expression of BM proteins, particularly fibronectin, laminin, and type IV collagen, in the anterior stroma of keratoconic corneas was also observed. Conclusions: These results indicate the activation of keratocytes into the fibroblast and myofibroblast wound phenotypes and the potential source of corneal scarring commonly observed in keratoconic corneas. Our data also support the hypothesis of dysregulated collagen synthesis and breakdown in the keratoconic cornea, in particular, the BM, and suggest a role for the BM in initiation and progression of keratoconus. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Optimal glycaemic control in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) reduces maternal and infant morbidity. Method. A survey was administered to women diagnosed with GDM to explore their views and experiences in achieving optimal glycaemic control. Results. Sixty women participated. Enablers included being taught to test capillary blood glucose in group settings where the health professional demonstrated this on themselves first (60, 100%); health professionals listening (41, 68%); being reminded to perform blood glucose testing (33, 55%); and being provided healthy meals by friends and family (28, 47%). Barriers included not having information in a woman's first language (33, 55%); being offered unhealthy food (19, 31%); not being believed by health professionals (13, 21%); receiving inconsistent information by health professionals (10, 16%); never being seen twice by the same health professional (8, 13%); and long waiting hours at clinics (7, 11%). Two-thirds of women (37, 62%) reported that food costs were not a barrier, but that they were always or frequently hungry. Conclusion.

Methods: Retrospective chart review of adolescent patients with T1DM seen within the paediatric diabetes service in Auckland, New Zealand, from 2006 to 2016. MA, HTN, patient demographic characteristics and ACEI prescribing and monitoring indices were examined. Results: Five hundred adolescents with T1DM were included. There were 26 patients (5%) with MA and/or HTN. MA alone was present in 16, HTN alone in 3 and both HTN and MA in 7. The 5-year MA/HTN-free rate was 98%, and the 10-year MA/HTN-free rate was 93%. Longer disease duration and earlier diagnosis were predictors of MA/HTN. There was no significant difference in standard clinical indices between study patients and others. ACEI was prescribed for 17 of 26 patients for either HTN or MA. Within 6 weeks of ACEI commencement, less than half of the subjects had repeat serum creatinine and MA screens and no record of repeat blood pressure measurement. Despite this, all patients had 3-monthly reviews within outpatient clinics where adjustments of ACEI doses were made. Conclusion: In our regional adolescent population with T1DM, there were low rates of both MA and/or HTN. In those who required treatment with ACEI, clinical monitoring post-commencement of therapy was inconsistent.

Together with topoisomerase I, these enzymes are able to relieve the torsional stress in chromatin caused by DNA helix unwinding during RNA and DNA synthesis. Although catalytic inhibitors of topoisomerase IIa and II? are known, drugs that poison the action of these enzymes, leading to failure of DNA religation and subsequent DNA doublestrand breakage, are more significant in terms of cancer therapy. Clinical topoisomerase II poisons bind to the enzyme DNA complex with doxorubicin and epirubicin binding mainly to DNA, etoposide mainly to the enzyme, and amsacrine binding to both. Selectivity for individual tumor types depends on the activity of inward and outward drug transporters, of which P-glycoprotein is an example. In addition to transport, cellular responses to DNA breakage and immunological responses to dying cells also contribute to antitumor activity. Further understanding of the multiple factors that influence cellular uptake and retention of drug, as well as of tumor and host tissue responses, is important for the development of future drugs in this class. ?

This chapter provides examples of policies of low-income, middle-income, and highincome countries that are at different stages of development with regard to their health system. It includes policies implemented in the wake of the Universal Declaration of Human Rightsfollowed by a description of national efforts to increase pharmaceutical production and supply, and measures to harmonize national regulations with international standards. Finally, increased access to affordable drugs is explored with an emphasis on the wider availability of generic drugs. The lowincome and lower middle-income countries included are Pakistan, the Philippines, Vietnam, and the East African Community; the upper middle-income examples included are Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, Colombia, China, Ecuador, Jordan, Russia and South Africa. Poland, Saudi Arabia, Trinidad and Tobago, and UAE are then presented as examples of high-income countries with developing healthcare systems. The chapter concludes that pharmaceutical policies have played a central role to make drugs more available and accessible and thereby improve social conditions and decrease poverty. Still, there are structural developments that present considerable challenges in providing equitable access to drugs. Pharmaceutical policy deals with the development, provision, and use of drugs within a healthcare system. The need for pharmaceutical policies became urgent after the thalidomide scandal in the 1960s [1] and was reinforced by an overall increase in drug utilization and the establishment of health insurance systems [2]. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that all countries formulate and implement a comprehensive national pharmaceutical policy in order to address pharmaceutical sector issues under a common framework [3]. The policy should embrace all drugs which should be available in a market, including original brands and generic drugs, biologics (products derived from living sources, as opposed to chemical compositions), vaccines, and natural health products [3]. It should ensure that people get good quality drugs at the lowest possible price, and that doctors prescribe the minimum of required drugs in order to treat the patient’s illness. In four decades, the concept of national pharmaceutical policy has become broadly recognized and implemented in more than 100 countries [4]. Key components of a national pharmaceutical policy are regulation of access (e.g., essential drugs), control of quality, safety and efficacy, economic accessibility (e.g., price regulation and reimbursement systems), publicly available information, and strategies for rational drug use. All across the globe, pharmaceutical policies have undergone significant changes in recent decades, resulting in improved availability, access, and quality of drugs by better systems for surveillance and support to national industry. This book provides examples of regulatory policies in pharmaceutical markets in a selection of countries that show a great deal of variety in the construction of their healthcare systems. Yet, there are common features in agreement with international treaties on human rights and implementation of national drug policies within a framework of combined public and private healthcare systems. ?

The Republic of Trinidad and Tobago is a twin-island democratic nation located off the north coast of Venezuela in the Caribbean. The country is experiencing an epidemiological transition with a decline in the incidence of communicable diseases, and increases in chronic, noncommunicable diseases. Therefore, it is critical that pharmaceutical polices are reflective of our new health realities. This chapter sets the base for examining the country’s polices by exploring its health and regulatory system. It takes an in-depth look at the processes, which are in place and identifies gaps and best practices, which takes place in Trinidad and Tobago. The authors delve into identifying the county’s procurement and distribution system of pharmaceuticals within the public sectors and how are these processes financed. The role of the pharmacist and prescribing practices of doctors are also examined with a view to gain an understanding of the entire system. Trinidad and Tobago has significant policies, processes, and agencies in place to encourage best pharmaceutical practices. However, there continues to be gaps with implementation of some policies and processes, which hinders compliance. This chapter finally details these challenges. ?

Recent extensive genomic and transcriptomic analyses have identified many different classes and sizes of ncRNA. They are now understood to be critical to the overall functioning, growth, development, and differentiation of cells. Differential expression and tissue specificity of many ncRNAs have been reported in normal development and disease states including cancer. Lack of functional ncRNAs may also lead to cancer progression. Therefore noncoding transcripts as biomarkers may be used in either predictive or prognostic ways. As such, over the past 15 years they have emerged as key biomarkers in cancer pathology, relating to both early detection and molecular subtyping. Due to important functional roles of ncRNAs in various cancers, the requirement for technologies used in the field is rapidly increasing. This chapter classifies ncRNAs based on their sizes, and describes methods applied for the identification and characterization of ncRNAs. It outlines key methods used for the purification of good quality RNA, various detection methods, analysis of gene expression as well as techniques that can applied for functional characterization of ncRNA. It also highlights critical steps and options to provide a general guide for ncRNA analysis. ?

Currently, contact-type and non-real-time random inspection are methods used to verify whether drivers are drunk driving. However, these techniques cannot meet the actual demand of drunk driving testing. This study considers the following traffic parameters as inputs: speed-up, even-speed, and sharp-turn road segments; vehicle speed; acceleration and accelerator pedal position; and engine speed. Thereafter, this study adopts the support vector machine model to identify drivers' driving behaviors to determine whether they are drunk driving, as well as the particle swarm optimization algorithm to optimize the model, thereby improving training speed. Results show that the support vector machine model based on the particle swarm optimization algorithm can immediately and accurately determine the drunk driving state of drivers, provide theoretical support to non-contact drunk driving test, and realize the foundation of safety driving assistance system toward the adoption of the corresponding measures. Therefore, this study has positive significance in improving traffic safety. ?

Food product characteristics such as ""familiarity"" or ""novelty"" are strong consumer drivers to purchase and consume. Accordingly, food innovation and manufacturing is presently focused on novel ways of maximizing the transfer of the health benefits of plant-based bioactives (especially antioxidants) to consumers via familiar everyday foods. Dietary antioxidants such as phenolic acids, flavonoids, carotenoids, terpenoids and vitamins have gained increasing attention as ""supertools"" in the fight for better health and sustainable wellness. These species can inhibit oxidation, decompose lipid hydroperoxides, combat reactive oxygen or nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), scavenge free radicals, or act as reductants and regenerate co-antioxidants, thereby helping to prevent oxidative and metabolic stress-induced degenerative diseases and agerelated health problems. In addition to validated efficacy, the natural appeal of antioxidants derived from nature stimulates regular consumption of sustainably sourced bioactives. This chapter provides an overview of latest research targeting the transfer to consumers of naturally occurring antioxidants from fresh produce or food ingredients. Emphasis is placed on staples, spices and non-conventional fruits and vegetables such as wheat, rice, ginger, onion, apple and cactus via consumer friendly foods. Approaches and methodologies for quantifying and characterizing the chemical and biological properties of antioxidants in isolated form (either purified individual compounds or antioxidant-rich extracts) and in food matrices, are explored. Insights into the diverse mechanisms of action of the antioxidants in human defence systems are also discussed. A need is identified to improve bio-utilization of dietary antioxidants through careful selection and assimilation of food ingredients/materials into everyday meals to maximize the recovery and delivery of natural antioxidants. Optimizing the interactions and redox balance between antioxidants and other dietary constituents during food processing, handling, digestion and bioabsorption is also emphasized. ? 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Weight regain is an important complication due to its association with recurrence of diabetes, deterioration in quality of life and economic implications. Despite this, weight regain remains inconsistently reported and poorly understood. The phenomenon of weight regain following bariatric surgery has no consensus definition. In the small number of series where it is reported, the definition may be any weight regain or an increase in an arbitrarily chosen value such as an increase of 10kg, 5kg/m2 or 25%EWL from the post-operative weight loss nadir. The result is that reported rates of regain vary from 6% at two years to 76% at six years post-operatively. The causes of weight regain after sleeve gastrectomy have not been definitively established. A systematic review revealed five possible contributors: technical factors, sleeve dilatation, ghrelin levels, maladaptive lifestyle behaviours and lack of adequate follow-up support. Further studies are required to understand the underlying mechanisms definitively. The management of weight regain following sleeve gastrectomy is not well described. Management guidelines are difficult to formulate given the variability in definition, incomplete understanding of its etiology and lack of robust evidence for revision procedures. Currently, management varies from observation to major revision surgery and is generally tailored to the patient and is dependent on the options available at the treating bariatric service. Weight regain following sleeve gastrectomy is a common complication with significant implications. To date, its understanding and management have been hampered by the lack of a standardised definition and paucity of robust studies. Once these issues are addressed, the identification and management of weight regain following sleeve gastrectomy will be able to be optimised. ? 2017 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",Sleeve gastrectomy; Weight regain,,2-s2.0-85019783029

The feasibility of SBI in the ED, however, remains contentious and no studies have been conducted on this topic in a New Zealand ED. Materials and Methods: This study recruited 8 experienced ED nurses who attempted to provide SBI, using the ASSIST-Lite tool, to as many of their patients as possible over one calendar month. All nurses participated in a comprehensive 1-day training workshop on the administration and interpretation of the ASSIST-Lite and linked brief intervention. Results: Only 46 (11.79%) of the 390 eligible patients were given the opportunity to participate over the data collection period. Analysis of the data showed there was a significant, negative correlation between the number of patients in the ED and the average number of screens that were performed by the nurses, and that the number of screens waned immediately after SBI training. Following the data collection period, the nurse participants were interviewed about their experience. These interviews revealed 3 main themes that contextualized the willingness to, but inherent difficulty of, administering the SBI within the ED environment. Conclusions: High patient-To-nurse ratios in the ED currently preclude nurses from providing consistent SBI to all eligible patients; however, there are several practical considerations highlighted here that might help nurses increase the participation rate. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In this model, known as the hygiene hypothesis, risk of severe polio increased with socioeconomic status (SES) because higher SES was associated with older age at infection. Rural residence was also linked to increased polio risk due to older age at infection. Crowding and larger family size were associated with earlier age at infection and thus reduced the risk of severe polio. In contrast, according to the intensive-exposure hypothesis proposed by Nielsen and colleagues (2001, 2002), exposure to the poliovirus within the home was linked to increased severity of infection, making larger family size and crowding important risk factors. Data for polio deaths in Wentworth and York counties, including the cities of Hamilton and Toronto, from 1900 to 1937 were gathered from a variety of archival sources and socioeconomic class was coded using the five-point composite score scale from Hauser (1982). The results provide support for the intensive-exposure hypothesis as an addition to the traditional polio model. Age at death increased with status score during the earlier 1900–1929 period, but not in the 1930–1937 period. The overall proportions of polio deaths in the various status scores were stable over both periods and disproportionately prevalent in status score three (skilled blue collar). This analysis of polio mortality provides a more nuanced picture of the disease and its relation to SES in a time of rapidly changing socioecological conditions. ?

Huntington disease is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by involuntary movements and cognitive and psychiatric disturbances. The disease is caused by an expansion of polyglutamine repeats in the N-terminal domain of the huntingtin protein from a genetic mutation in the HTT gene on human chromosome 4. The major pathosis occurs in the brain with profound degeneration in the forebrain regions, namely the striatum and the cerebral cortex. Despite the single gene etiology, there is major variability in the neuropathology, as well as major heterogeneity in the symptom profiles. Recent in vivo imaging and pathological studies have shown that cortical degeneration is related to variable symptomatology. Here, we summarize the recent progress on how cortical degeneration contributes to symptom heterogeneity in Huntington disease. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Design A 5-step stakeholder engagement process based on methodological guidelines for identifying research priorities in health. Participants: 277 individuals were identified as representatives for 30 different stakeholder organisations across 86 countries. The stakeholder organisations represented the views of medical educators, medical students, doctors, patients and researchers in medical education. Interventions Each stakeholder representative was asked to provide up to three research questions that should be deemed as a priority for medical nutrition education. Main outcome measures Research questions were critically appraised for answerability, sustainability, effectiveness, potential for translation and potential to impact on disease burden. A blinded scoring system was used to rank the appraised questions, with higher scores indicating higher priority (range of scores possible 36-108). Results: 37 submissions were received, of which 25 were unique research questions. Submitted questions received a range of scores from 62 to 106 points. The highest scoring questions focused on (1) increasing the confidence of medical students and doctors in providing nutrition care to patients, (2) clarifying the essential nutrition skills doctors should acquire, (3) understanding the effectiveness of doctors at influencing dietary behaviours and (4) improving medical students' attitudes towards the importance of nutrition. Conclusions: These research questions can be used to ensure future projects in medical nutrition education directly align with the needs and preferences of research stakeholders.

GRIN2A encodes a modulatory subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR). We hypothesized that certain GRIN2A mutations increase NMDAR function and support melanoma growth through oncogenic effects. This hypothesis was tested using 19 low-passage melanoma cell lines, four of which carried novel missense mutations in GRIN2A that we previously reported. We examined NMDAR expression, function of a calcium ion (Ca2+) channel and its contribution to cell growth using pharmacological modulators; findings were correlated with the presence or absence of GRIN2A mutations. We found that NMDAR expression was low in all melanoma cell lines, independent of GRIN2A mutations. In keeping with this, NMDAR-mediated Ca2+ influx and its contribution to cell proliferation were weak in most cell lines. However, certain GRIN2A mutations and culture media with lower glutamate levels enhanced NMDAR effects on cell growth and invasion. The main finding was that G762E was associated with higher glutamate-mediated Ca2+ influx and stronger NMDAR contribution to cell proliferation, compared with wild-type GRIN2A and other GRIN2A mutations. The pro-invasive phenotype of mutated cell lines was increased in culture medium containing less glutamate, implying environmental modulation of mutation effects. In conclusion, NMDAR ion channel function is low in cultured melanoma cells but supports cell proliferation and invasion. Selected GRIN2A mutations, such as G762E, are associated with oncogenic consequences that can be modulated by extracellular glutamate. Primary cultures may be better suited to determine the role of the NMDAR in melanoma in vivo. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Calcium; Cancer; Ion channel; Melanoma; NMDA receptor; Oncogene; Tumor suppressor,"calcium channel; glutamic acid; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor 2A; calcium; glutamic acid; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; N-methyl D-aspartate receptor subtype 2A; animal cell; Article; calcium transport; cancer cell culture; cancer growth; cell invasion; cell proliferation; controlled study; culture medium; disease association; extracellular space; fetus; gene mutation; GRIN2A gene; human; human cell; human tissue; melanoma; melanoma cell line; missense mutation; nonhuman; oncogene; phenotype; primary cell culture; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; rat; receptor down regulation; tumor invasion; tumor promotion; wild type; antagonists and inhibitors; dose response; drug effects; genetics; melanoma; metabolism; mutation; pathology; structure activity relation; tumor cell line; Calcium; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Glutamic Acid; Humans; Melanoma; Mutation; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Structure-Activity Relationship",2-s2.0-84997830851

Methods - A prospective cross-sectional study was undertaken on pregnant women presenting for outpatient obstetric imaging. For each side, the renal length and axial anteroposterior diameter of the renal pelvis were measured. Maternal demographics, gravidity and parity, number of fetuses, and estimated fetal weight (when available) were recorded. Results - A total of 700 women enrolled, with 191 excluded. The 509 women analyzed included 465 singleton and 44 twin pregnancies. A total of 815 sonographic investigations were performed: 716 in singleton pregnancies and 99 in twin pregnancies. The gestational age range was 10 to 40 weeks. Charts depicting the anteroposterior renal pelvis diameter versus gestational age were constructed to determine normative sonographic reference data for maternal renal pelvis dilatation in singleton pregnancies. Although the mean renal pelvis diameter increased as pregnancy progressed, measurements of greater than 10 mm remained relatively uncommon, being identified in 9.7% of right and 2.1% of left kidneys in the third trimester. Only 4.1% of right and 0.4% of left third-trimester measurements exceeded 15 mm. Right renal pelvis measurements on average were greater than the left by 1.54 mm (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20 to 1.87 mm). Twins had significantly larger renal pelvis measurements than singletons on average, measuring 2.11 mm (95% CI, 1.50 to 2.72 mm) larger on the right and 1.69 mm (95% CI, 0.73 to 2.65) on the left.

This case study presents an eight-year old girl with Moebius Syndrome (MC) who received 30 sessions of speech therapy. This occurred after presenting to clinic 11 months after left facial reanimation with gracilis thigh muscle transfer surgery. On examination, only flickers of left facial movement were observed. There was no movement on the right side of the face. As a consequence of the minimal movement, MC presented with drooling and unintelligible speech. The purpose of speech therapy was three fold: minimise the pooling of saliva, improve the placement of the articulators so that articulation of speech sounds would be more accurate, and gain advances in overall intelligibility. Methods Therapy focussed on speech, facial movement and saliva management using a combination of speech drills, evidence-based articulation therapies, facial exercises with surface electromyography biofeedback, self-awareness training and compensatory saliva management strategies. Results After a course of 30 one-hour speech therapy sessions, substantial improvements were seen in speech sound accuracy, overall intelligibility, facial movement and saliva control. Conclusions The combination of surgery and speech therapy led to functional gains that surgery alone did not achieve.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of the Fiji Injury Surveillance in Hospitals database – a prospective population-based trauma registry – to examine the incidence and epidemiological characteristics associated with injury-related deaths and hospital admissions among youth aged 15–24 years. The study base was Viti Levu, Fiji, during the 12-month period concluding on 30 September 2006. Results: One in four injuries in the Fiji Injury Surveillance in Hospitals database occurred among youth (n = 515, incidence rate 400/100 000). Injury rates were higher among men, those aged 20–24 years compared with 15- to 19-year-olds, and indigenous Fijians (iTaukei) compared with Indians. The leading causes among indigenous Fijians were being hit by a person/object (men) and falls (women), whereas for Indians, it was road traffic injuries (men) and intentional poisoning (women). Most injuries occurred at home (39%) or on the road (22%). Of the 63 fatal events, 57% were intentional injuries, and most deaths (73%) occurred prior to hospitalisation. Homicide rates were four times higher among indigenous Fijians than Indians, whereas suicide rates were five times higher among Indians compared with indigenous Fijians. Conclusions: Important ethnic-specific differences in the epidemiology of fatal and serious non-fatal injuries are apparent among youth in Fiji. Efforts to prevent the avoidable burden of injury among Fiji youth thus requires inter-sectoral cooperation that takes account of important sociocultural, environmental and health system factors such as unmet mental healthcare needs and effective pre-hospital trauma services. ? 2016 The Authors Journal of Paediatrics and Child Health published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",accident; adolescent; developing country; Pacific Island; wound and injury,adolescent; adult; age distribution; Article; automutilation; child; childhood injury; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cultural factor; cuts wound; environmental factor; ethnic difference; ethnicity; falling; fatality; female; Fiji; fracture; head injury; health care need; health care system; health survey; highway; home; homicide; hospital admission; hospital service; hospitalization; hospitalized child; human; incidence; Indian; indigent; intentional injury; intentional poisoning; interpersonal violence; intoxication; major clinical study; male; open wound; priority journal; sex difference; socioeconomics; traffic accident; violence; young adult,2-s2.0-84983554829

As a result of improved interventions, 90% of people with congenital heart disease now survive to adulthood. They must undergo regular imaging to assess their biventricular (left and right ventricular) function. Analysis of the images is problematic due to the large variety of shapes and complex geometry. In this paper we extend a biventricular modeling method to improve the analysis of MR images from congenital heart disease patients. We used a subdivision surface method to create three customizable exemplars, representing common manifestations of anatomy, and incorporated these as priors into an interactive biventricular customization procedure. The CHD-specific priors were tested on 60 cases representing a variety of congenital heart diseases for which the gold standard manual contours were available. The introduction of multiple priors showed a significant decrease in analysis time while maintaining good correlation between the two methods (R2 &gt;.82). ? 2016 IEEE.",,"biological model; congenital heart malformation; diagnostic imaging; heart left ventricle function; heart right ventricle function; heart ventricle; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; Heart Defects, Congenital; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Patient-Specific Modeling; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Function, Right",2-s2.0-85009128687

It is the leading cause of death in infants and young children with the majority of these deaths occurring in low income countries. Risk factors affecting incidence and outcome include extremes of age, poor nutrition, immunosuppression, environmental exposures and socioeconomic determinants. Pneumonia can be caused by a wide range of pathogens including bacteria, viruses and fungi, and the etiology varies by epidemiological setting, comorbidities and whether the pneumonia is community-acquired or hospital-acquired. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the major cause of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia while Gram negative bacteria, often resistant to multiple antibiotics, are common causes of hospital-acquired pneumonia and pneumonia in immunosuppressed individuals. Diagnosis is generally clinical and management is based mainly on knowledge of likely causative pathogens as well as clinical severity and presence of known risk factors. Timely and effective antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy if hypoxemic are critical to patient outcomes. Preventive measures range from improved nutrition and hygiene to specific vaccines that target common causes in children and adults such as the pneumococcal or influenza vaccines. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Methods: All 200 residents were eligible, with age and sex matching to demographically comparable referents. Face-to-face interviews included questions on health status, health-related quality of life (HRQOL) and perceptions about community consultation. Thirty serum samples were obtained, eligibility being based on likelihood of exposure and age. Both HRQOL and serum outcomes were analysed by the appropriate regression methods. Results: Of 200 eligible residents, 139 (69.5%) participated, with 139 matched referents. Mapua residents had lower physical and psychological HRQOL scores, but no difference in health status. 2,3,7,8 TCDD was below the limit of detection in the majority of all serum samples, with some congeners being higher in referents. Perceptions of the communication process were equivocal. Conclusions: Both dioxin levels and measures of health did not differ significantly between the exposed community and controls. Implications for public health: The results suggest neither significant dioxin exposure nor community health effects. Oversight by expert panel with health expertise, allied to sound communication, may have helped the community understand the risks. ? 2016 Public Health Association of Australia",dioxins; environmental exposure; polychlorinated biphenyls,,2-s2.0-84989938112

Obesity is the result of an excess of caloric intake in comparison with energy expenditure. In itself, this leads to oxidative stress and DNA damage. DNA-reactive mutagens including those formed during high temperature-cooking processes of red meats or from other processing methods are still common, albeit unintentional, components of the diet of many individuals. Improved food storage technologies may be leading to a reduction in fungal contaminants such as aflatoxin B1, but endogenously or exogenously formed reactive species, inhibitors of DNA repair, or of the mitotic spindle occur in the human diet, and may also lead to genomic instability. Some of these may become incorporated into the diet through the uptake of environmental contaminants by food plants and animals. Conversely, various nutrients and phytochemicals may be protective. Carotenoids, vitamin D, and selenium are among the best studied nutrients here. Various phytochemicals, including isothiocyanates such as sulforaphane or polyphenols such as genistein or curcumin, have differing mechanisms of promoting genomic stability. Polymorphisms in genes for nutrient uptake, metabolism, and excretion will determine the optimal dietary intake for an individual.

The stromal extracellular matrix (ECM) consists of highly organised lamellae which are made up of tightly packed fibrils primarily composed of collagens type I and V. This layer is interspersed with keratocytes, mesenchymal cells of neural crest origin. We have previously shown that adult corneal keratocytes exhibit phenotypic plasticity and can be induced into a neuronal phenotype. In the current study we evaluated the potential of keratocytes to produce collagen type II via phenotypic reprogramming with exogenous chondrogenic factors. The cornea presents a challenge to tissue engineers owing to its high level of organisation and the phenotypic instability of keratocytes. Traditional approaches based on a scar model do not support the engineering of functional stromal tissue. Type II collagen is not found in the adult cornea but is reported to be expressed during corneal development, raising the possibility of using such an approach to regenerate the corneal ECM. Keratocytes in culture and within intact normal and diseased tissue were induced to produce collagen type II upon treatment with transforming growth factor Beta3 (TGFβ3) and dexamethasone. In vivo treatment of rat corneas also resulted in collagen type II deposition and a threefold increase in corneal hardness and elasticity. Furthermore, the treatment of corneas and subsequent deposition of collagen type II did not cause opacity, fibrosis or scarring. The induction of keratocytes with specific exogenous factors and resulting deposition of type II collagen in the stroma can potentially be controlled by withdrawal of the factors. This might be a promising new approach for in vivo corneal regeneration strategies aimed at increasing corneal integrity in diseases associated with weakened ectatic corneal tissue such as keratoconus. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Cornea; Growth factors; Keratoconus; Keratocytes; Stroma; Transforming growth factor beta3,"collagen type 1; collagen type 2; dexamethasone; transforming growth factor beta3; vimentin; collagen type 1; collagen type 2; dexamethasone; messenger RNA; transforming growth factor beta3; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; biomechanics; cadaver; cell aggregation; cell differentiation; cell regeneration; chondrocyte; controlled study; cornea; cornea cell; cornea opacity; cornea stroma; cornea tissue; elasticity; gene expression; human; immunohistochemistry; in vivo study; male; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; rat; Young modulus; animal; antibody specificity; cartilage; cell culture; chondrogenesis; cornea cell; drug effects; extracellular matrix; genetics; hardness; metabolism; Wistar rat; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cartilage; Cells, Cultured; Chondrogenesis; Collagen Type I; Collagen Type II; Corneal Keratocytes; Corneal Opacity; Dexamethasone; Elastic Modulus; Extracellular Matrix; Hardness; Humans; Male; Organ Specificity; Rats, Wistar; RNA, Messenger; Transforming Growth Factor beta3",2-s2.0-84996964933

Joint moments and muscle forces estimated by the computed muscle control (CMC) method using kinematic data from six healthy adolescents at their comfortable speed were used to evaluate the PMFE. The simulation results show that muscle forces estimated from the PMFE match well with those from the CMC, and the PMFE has significant computational efficiency (the entire swing phase takes only 0.02 s). As a case study, a novel patient-specific biological command-based controller (PSBc), based on the PMFE, was developed to control a human-inspired swing-assist rehabilitation robot. The PSBc is evaluated by both simulation and robot experiment.

In an attempt to identify potential barriers to regularly receiving an annual cervical smear, we invited the women to complete a questionnaire. The responses from women who had regularly received an annual cervical smear were compared with those who had not.RESULTS: The proportion of women who had received a cervical smear increased from 44% in 2001, to 73% in 2010 (p=0.001). Ninety-three women (76%) completed the study questionnaire. No statistically significant differences were found in the questionnaire responses between the women who had regularly received an annual cervical smear and those who had not.CONCLUSION: The proportion of women in this cohort who received a cervical smear in 2010 is comparable with other studies of women with HIV infection in New Zealand and overseas. We have not been able to identify barriers that prevent women with HIV infection in Auckland regularly receiving an annual cervical smear. We plan to encourage women who have not received a cervical smear in the previous 2-year period to have a cervical smear performed when they attend the Infectious Disease Clinic, and will continue to notify the National Cervical Screening Programme that all women who are newly diagnosed with HIV infection should have an annual recall code attached to future cervical smear reports.

Other nutritional supplements, minerals and vitamins including mannan oligosaccharides (MOS), zinc and vitamins A, C and E have also been used for immune support. The aim of this prospective blinded randomized clinical trial was to evaluate the effects of a BC, MOS, zinc and vitamin based enhanced bovine colostrum supplement (BCS) on incidence and duration of RD occurring in yearling horses. 109 yearlings on two Thoroughbred farms in Central Kentucky were randomly assigned to treatment or placebo groups. Yearlings were supplemented once daily for 17 to 25 weeks with 100 g of a high quality commercial BCS (containing 50 g BC) or a full fat soy flour placebo, which were applied as a ""top-dress"" to feed. Yearlings were observed daily and evaluated weekly for signs of RD. All yearlings completed the study. The proportion of the study period during which each yearling exhibited illness was considerably shorter for BCS yearlings (least squares mean = 23% of the study period) than placebo yearlings (least squares mean = 34% of the study period, P = .002). The average duration of illness was shorter for BCS yearlings (1.96 weeks) than placebo yearlings (4.39 weeks, P < .0001).

Psychopharmacological and behavioral interventions, often in combination, are common interventions for challenging behavior. However, little is known about the interaction between psychopharmacological treatment and the motivation or, more precisely, the function of challenging behavior. A better understanding of these processes may be critical to optimize treatment efficacy. Objectives: An overall review of the literature on the interaction between behavior function and psychotropic medication in people with ID, and directly related variables (e.g. motivating operations) was conducted. As a result, we discuss the behavioral processes involved in medication–behavior function interaction and the methodological and clinical implications of this research area. Methods: A comprehensive literature review was conducted of current peer-reviewed publications. Results and Conclusion: Evidence suggests medication can affect the function of challenging behavior in several ways (i.e. add new functions, decrease the number of functions, and/or change the function). Moreover, medication–function interaction was a relatively infrequent occurrence. We found the analysis of variables that alter the effectiveness of a reinforcing or punishing stimulus, called motivating operations (e.g. satiation, deprivation, illness) provides an experimental model for the analysis of the behavioral mechanisms associated with medication– function interactions. Further, single-subject designs and functional analysis methodology can be combined to evaluate medication–function interactions. ?

To our knowledge, SICI has only been demonstrated in contralateral motor evoked potentials (MEPs). Ipsilateral MEPs (iMEPs) are assumed to reflect excitability of an uncrossed oligosynaptic pathway, and can sometimes be evoked in proximal upper-limb muscles using high-intensity TMS. We examined whether iMEPs in the biceps brachii (BB) would be suppressed by subthreshold conditioning, therefore demonstrating SICI of iMEPs. TMS was delivered to the dominant M1 to evoke conditioned (C) and nonconditioned (NC) iMEPs in the nondominant BB of healthy participants during weak bilateral elbow flexion. The conditioning stimulus intensities tested were 85%, 100%, and 115% of active motor threshold (AMT), at 2 ms and 4 ms interstimulus intervals (ISI). The iMEP ratio (C/NC) was calculated for each condition to assess the amount of inhibition. Inhibition of iMEPs was present at 2 ms ISI with 100% and 115% AMT (both P < 0.03), mediated by a reduction in persistence and size (all P < 0.05). To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of SICI of iMEPs.

We identified men aged 40+ years in the Midland Cancer Network region registered with prostate cancer in 2007-2010 in the Cancer Registry. Data were extracted from patient notes of all M?ori men and a sample of NZ Europeans. The survival disparity between M?ori men and Europeans was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional-hazards regression models after adjusting for other factors. This study included 535 men with prostate cancer (135 M?ori men and 400 Europeans). The 5-year cancer-specific survival was 98.6% for men diagnosed with localised cancer, 88.8% for locally advanced disease and 19.1% for metastatic cancer. The all-cause survival and the cancer-specific survival were both significantly poorer for M?ori men than for NZ Europeans (log rank test: P?=?0.004, 0.006 respectively). The hazard ratio of cancer-specific survival for M?ori men was 2.01 (95% CI: 1.21-3.36) compared with NZ Europeans. M?ori men with prostate cancer had poorer all-cause survival and cancer-specific survival than NZ Europeans. M?ori men were at risk of having more advanced disease at diagnosis, which explains most of the survival inequity between M?ori men and NZ Europeans. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Equity; Ethnicity; Indigenous population; M?ori; Prostatic neoplasms; Survival,adult; aged; cancer staging; Caucasian; comorbidity; health disparity; human; Kaplan Meier method; male; middle aged; mortality; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; pathology; proportional hazards model; prostate tumor; Adult; Aged; Comorbidity; European Continental Ancestry Group; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Proportional Hazards Models; Prostatic Neoplasms,2-s2.0-84959054926

We used metadata from the source, text features, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model outputs and manually annotated disposition labels that separate comments into affirmative or negative groups together with Gradient Boosted Models (GBM) to devise a set of disposition models inferring commentators' sentiment towards each topic and expand our understanding of relevant arguments. Manual annotation resulted in moderate interrater agreement of an average 0.48 Fleiss-Kappa. Despite that, the disposition models for each topic were able to achieve a balanced successful prediction rates of between 68% and 74% providing a considerably better than chance assessment of a commentator's disposition towards each topic. We observed changes in disposition over time and found areas of disagreement between the supporters and opponents of each topic.

Evaluation tools able to take account of the more holistic approach to the attainment of mental health that characterises Ma‾ori, the indigenous population of Aotearoa (New Zealand) with specificity to the rangatahi population are critical to this examination. The study aims were to: (1) develop an instrument and establish its psychometric properties; and (2) use the measure to establish rangatahi views on desirable CAMHS characteristics. A kaupapa Ma‾ori (Ma‾ori-driven) research paradigm, based on the traditional Po‾whiri process of engagement and participation, particularly the components of karanga, mihimihi, whaiko‾rero and koha guided this quantitative research approach. These components are essential to positive contact and commitment to the study processes by researchers and participants. A self-administered survey, Te Tomo mai, was developed by modifying a North American questionnaire, the Youth Services Survey for Youth. The intent of the tool was to record rangatahi experiences and views on service acceptability. The Te Tomo mai survey incorporates questions designed to examine CAMHS delivery in the light of the Whare Tapa Wha‾, a Ma‾ori comprehensive model of health with a focus on culturally responsive services. This survey was completed by a cohort of 69 Ma‾ori rangatahi who were referred to six CAMHS District Health Boards in Aotearoa. The Te Tomo mai instrument factor structure, specifically the cultural factor, had similarity to the North American questionnaire from which it had been derived. This work confirms the concept that Ma‾ori desire therapeutic methods consistent with the Whare Tapa Wha‾, such as the importance of culture and spirituality. It further identified issues relevant to Ma‾ori rangatahi acceptability with CAMHS such as access, satisfaction and appropriateness. The participants were generally positive about the services they received from the CAMHS, which shows good acceptability of CAMHS for Ma‾ori. The Te Tomo mai instrument can prove useful if applied in Aotearoa or other similar cultural settings. It is a means of determining the cultural acceptability which will contribute to improving CAMHS delivery to rangatahi from indigenous populations. ? 2013 ? 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Child and adolescent mental health; Indigenous; Service measurement and improvement,adolescent; child; clinical article; cultural factor; human; juvenile; mental health service; model; quantitative study; questionnaire; religion; satisfaction; scientist,2-s2.0-84958121370

Currently, eleven percent of the worldwide population is 65 years and older. This number will more than double to twenty-two percent (2 billion) by 2050. As the older population continues its inexorable growth, so does the number of older adults with mental health disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease, depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. For example, the number of individuals affected by dementia worldwide is expected to double every twenty years to over 81 million by 2040. Depressive episodes in later life are also prevalent, and depression is the leading cause of disability in older adults worldwide. These mental disorders lead to increased morbidity and mortality in older adults, and often they can exact a negative toll on their family members. To respond to the ageing world, this book sets out to help researchers, policy makers, service providers, and students develop their knowledge of the issues associated with ageing and mental health throughout the world.

A constructivist grounded theory method was adopted. Ten non-structured interviews were conducted with secondary school nurses working in Auckland, New Zealand, between January and July 2013. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed using all tenets of grounded theory that included writing memos, theoretical sampling and the constant comparative method. Analysis revealed the core category Maintaining the balance, which is presented as a grounded theory model. It represents the constant state of balancing the school nurse undergoes in trying to counter the risk to the student. The nurse attempts to tip the balance in favour of action, by reducing barriers to healthcare, providing youth-friendly, affordable and accessible healthcare, and following up until resolution is achieved. The nurse is aware that failing to monitor until resolution can again tip the fulcrum back to inaction, placing the young person at risk again. It is concluded that nurses are knowledgeable about the risks present in the communities they serve and are innovative in the methods they employ to ensure satisfactory outcomes for young people experiencing skin infections. School nursing is an evolving model for delivering primary healthcare to young people in New Zealand. The grounded theory model 'Maintaining the balance' describes a model of care where nursing services are delivered where young people spend time, and the nurse is immersed in the community. This model of care may be transferable to other healthcare situations. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Grounded theory; Nursing; School; Skin infections; Young people; Youth,"adolescent; adult; female; grounded theory; health personnel attitude; human; interview; male; middle aged; New Zealand; nursing; risk factor; school health nursing; school health service; Skin Diseases, Bacterial; Adolescent; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Female; Grounded Theory; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Risk Factors; School Health Services; School Nursing; Skin Diseases, Bacterial",2-s2.0-84958771641

The goal of this study was to use a computational model of the DRUJ to investigate the influence distal radius orientation has on its contact mechanics. Detailed, finite element models of the radius and ulna bones were constructed from magnetic resonance imaging data. The orientation of the distal radius was rotated in 2° increments about three orthogonal axes representing dorsal–palmar rotation, radial–ulnar rotation and anteversion-retroversion. A computational model was used to predict joint contact at the DRUJ in each condition. Joint contact was found to be most sensitive to dorsal rotation of the distal radius, while radial and ulnar rotation did not substantially affect joint contact pressure. Slight retroversion was found to lower joint contact pressure. In most cases, more than 6° rotation in a given direction resulted in dislocation of the DRUJ, so that adaptation at the joint would be required to maintain articular contact. The joint contact model implemented in this study allowed the relationship between distal radius orientation and DRUJ contact to be examined systematically, in a way that is difficult to achieve using a cadaver-based approach. The results demonstrated the distal radius displacements most critical for maintaining healthy joint mechanics at the DRUJ. It is important that clinicians consider the influence of distal radius malunion and its treatment on DRUJ mechanics, in addition to its consequences for wrist function and forearm rotation.

Based on the biological architecture of human masticatory system, this robot is modeled in the form of a redundantly actuated parallel mechanism constrained by two point-contact higher kinematic pairs (HKPs). The aim of this robot is to chew samples of newly developed foods in a human way while the food textures can be characterized. The kinematics including inverse kinematics, workspace and singularity are studied systematically. The inverse kinematics is given in closed-form solutions. The workspace is generated by a numerical search method. In virtue of the Jacobian matrix derived from differential kinematics, the singularity and the stiffness are investigated. Via the derived stiffness matrix and mass matrix, natural frequency is also computed. Finally, simulation is carried out, one real incisor trajectory of a healthy human subject is reproduced, illustrating the robot is able to reproduce kinematic behaviors of the human masticatory system, and it owns a satisfactory performance in terms of stiffness and natural frequency. Comparison between the redundantly actuated masticatory robot and its two non-redundantly actuated counterparts also exhibits that the former owns better performance, in terms of a similar incisor's workspace as the Posselt envelope, no singularity, larger stiffness and higher natural frequency. ? 2015 IEEE.",Actuators; Dentistry; Jacobian matrices; Kinematics; Muscles; Robot kinematics,Actuators; Behavioral research; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Dentistry; Inverse kinematics; Inverse problems; Jacobian matrices; Kinematics; Mastication; Matrix algebra; Mechanisms; Muscle; Natural frequencies; Numerical methods; Point contacts; Robots; Stiffness; Stiffness matrix; Closed form solutions; Differential kinematics; Dynamic characteristics; Four-degrees-of-freedom; Incisor trajectories; Kinematic behaviors; Redundantly actuated; Robot kinematics; Intelligent robots,2-s2.0-84958172203

Method: Relevant patient treatment data from all hyperbaric units in Australia and NZ were collated and analysed. Results: The rate of referral to hyperbaric units in Australia for treatment or prophylaxis of patients with, or at risk of orofacial ORN, was 1.7 times the rate of referral in NZ. Within Australia, there was a greater than three-fold interstate variation. Conclusion: There is a significant referral rate difference both within Australia and between Australia and NZ for hyperbaric oxygen therapy for oro-facial ORN. Possible reasons for this difference include access to funding, logistical difficulties, clinician preference for an alternative treatment and clinician attitudes to hyperbaric oxygen. ? 2015, South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society.

Cross-sectional web- or paper-based surveys comprising open and closed response options were used to examine changes in prevailing attitudes and practices amongst non-government mental health service staff and users. Thematic analysis was used to interpret and present open response answers. Multi-variate logistic models were used to investigate which factors are associated with smoke-free attitudes and practices. Staff who smoke were found to be less likely to provide cessation support to clients (AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.31-0.82) and gave significantly lower estimates of the percentage of clients who wish to stop smoking (30% vs 44%, p < 0.0001). Those who had completed cessation training also had more positive views about the importance of providing cessation support and service user desire to stop smoking. Staff who had not completed cessation training had significantly lower odds of reporting they carried out quit smoking support often and routinely (AOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.23-0.47) The results suggest that continuing improvement will be enabled by increasing rates of cessation training amongst staff of mental health and addictions non-government organisations. In addition, there is a need for increased incentive and support for staff who smoke to quit. Copyright ?

However, its effectiveness among established urban gay communities in high-income countries is largely unexplored outside North America. We conducted a pilot study of RDS among urban GBM in Auckland, New Zealand to assess its local applicability for sexual health research. Findings: Pre-fieldwork formative assessment explored RDS suitability among local GBM. Highly-networked initial participants (""seeds"") and subsequent participants completed a questionnaire, took a rectal swab for chlamydia and gonorrhoea testing, and were asked to recruit up to three eligible peers over the subsequent 2 weeks using study coupons. Compensation was given for participating and for each peer enrolled. Feedback on the pilot was obtained through questionnaire items, participant follow-up, and a focus group. Nine seeds commenced recruitment, directly enrolling 10 participants (Wave One), who in turn enrolled a further three (Wave Two). Two of the 22 participants (9 %) had undiagnosed rectal chlamydia. The coupon redemption rate (23 %) was lower than the expected rate (33 %) for this population. Participants were motivated by altruism above financial incentives; however, time, transport and reluctance recruiting peers were perceived as barriers to enrolment. Discussion: Slow recruitment in our pilot study suggests that RDS might not be an effective or efficient method of sampling gay men in all high-income urban settings. However those who participated in the pilot were willing to provide anal swabs and information on their sexual behaviour, and also on the size of their GBM social network which is necessary to weight data in RDS. Refinements and adaptations such as reducing the transaction costs of taking part (e.g. offering online participation) could improve responses but these have their own drawbacks (higher set-up costs, difficulty collecting biological specimens). ? 2015 Ludlam et al.",Feasibility study; Formative assessment; Gay and bisexual men; HIV; New Zealand; Pilot study; Probability sample; Respondent-driven sampling; Sexually transmitted infections,"bisexuality; human; male; male homosexuality; New Zealand; pilot study; questionnaire; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Bisexuality; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Pilot Projects; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84944357004

Additionally it sought to establish research priorities for reducing training attrition and improving retention, selection standards and overall health and wellbeing of military personnel. Methods: A retrospective review of medical files and work force personnel data of all service members discharged under a medical release category between January 2006 and January 2013. A comparison was made between the reason for release, demographic and service for those medically discharged. Results: In total, 402 Regular Force members were medically discharged between the 1st of January 2006 and the 1st of January 2013. Of these, nearly half did so for musculoskeletal injury and disease and 19% for mental illness and behavioural disorders. Many were discharged with a condition or predisposition held prior to service. Females we found to be at significantly higher risk of discharge in comparison to male counterparts. Conclusions and implications: This is the first study which describes with sufficient data the epidemiology of medical discharge in the NZDF. Rates of discharge are similar to those observed in other militaries but highlight opportunities to improve relevant selection and training policies. ? 2015 Netzer et al.",Discharge; Injury; Medical; Military; Training,,2-s2.0-84979997974

Metal centers in complexes can occupy diverse coordination geometries which allow the design of molecules with a better fit for the target kinase or enzyme in more general terms. The modification of organic backbones with metal-based fragments provides also possibilities for the improvement of pharmacological properties. This may influence the pharmacokinetic behavior of compounds depending on the ligands, metal, and coordination geometry.

Method: A retrospective review of court-ordered psychiatric court reports and legal outcomes was conducted, for all defendants referred for insanity evaluations in the largest city in New Zealand (and its surrounding rural regions) for a 7-year period. Results: The majority (60%; 37) of those referred for evaluation were found legally insane. The opinion regarding moral wrongfulness was the single factor that differentiated successful insanity defendants from those who were found guilty. Conclusions: Despite the centrality of the insanity defence to forensic psychiatry, few studies internationally consider characteristics of those found insane, particularly in comparison with those who are found guilty. Psychiatrically evaluated defendants in this sample were relatively homogenous, perhaps due to the court liaison nurse screening process. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.",court outcomes; forensic; insanity; moral wrongfulness,adult; Article; court; crime; defendant; female; forensic psychiatry; human; major clinical study; male; medical record review; medicolegal aspect; mental disease; mental health care; mental hospital; morality; named groups of persons; New Zealand; priority journal; psychiatric diagnosis; psychiatrist; psychosis; rural area; schizophrenia; substance use,2-s2.0-84942196284

This article argues that popular acceptance of the institution of child nutrition advice, and state involvement in it, rests on a conception of advice as discretionary that is in tension with its persuasive intent. In the domain of child nutrition, the persuasive intent often prevails. Child nutrition advice can acquire the status of a set of parenting standards by stealthy means. This raises questions of fairness. Using the notion of role obligations, reasons are presented to separate out the setting of parental standards from the provision of child nutrition advice. ? 2015.",Child health advice and ethics; Ethics and advice giving; Feminist theory and parenting; Health promotion and ethics; Parental obligations and nutrition; Public health ethics and child nutrition,,2-s2.0-84941557451

Typically, they consist of two parts: (1) a database containing DNA profiles of known individuals and (2) a database of DNA profiles associated with crime scenes. The risk of adventitious or chance matches between crimes and innocent people increases as the number of profiles within a database grows and more data is shared between various forensic DNA databases, e.g. from different jurisdictions. The DNA profiles obtained from crime scenes are often partial because crime samples may be compromised in quantity or quality. When an individual's profile cannot be resolved from a DNA mixture, ambiguity is introduced. A wild card, F, may be used in place of an allele that has dropped out or when an ambiguous profile is resolved from a DNA mixture. Variant alleles that do not correspond to any marker in the allelic ladder or appear above or below the extent of the allelic ladder range are assigned the allele designation R for rare allele. R alleles are position specific with respect to the observed/unambiguous allele. The F and R designations are made when the exact genotype has not been determined. The F and R designation are treated as wild cards for searching, which results in increased chance of adventitious matches. We investigated the probability of adventitious matches given these two types of wild cards. ? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is widely recognized that life expectancy for men is, in most developed countries, lower than that of women, and such discrepancies can be linked, at least in part, to behaviors associated with 'being a man.' Morbidity, too, is affected by conformity to the expectations of hegemonic masculinity, with men differing markedly from women across a range of dimensions including emotional expression, body-image expectations, sexual behavior, and help-seeking. Ironically, stepping outside traditional male norms may also have adverse effects on health as such men become to a greater or lesser extent excluded from mainstream society. The suggestion, therefore, is that rather than seeking solutions at an individual level, there is a need for a wider societal revision of the specific expectations place upon both men and women. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Zebrafish nephrons show considerable conservation in structure and function compared with mammalian nephrons, with both exhibiting a common glomerular architecture and a similar tubule segmentation pattern. Unlike mammals, however, the zebrafish mesonephric kidney maintains a nephron progenitor population into adulthood and continues to generate new nephrons throughout life in response to growth or injury.

Most of the literature on family businesses is based on research in Western or Chinese societies, and our understanding of family-operated firms in other cultures, particularly Middle Eastern cultures, is limited. Thus, our paper attempts to bridge the gap by comparing a sample of businesses in which two or more family members participate with a sample of businesses in which there is no family-member participation. This study investigates two important issues: whether there are significant differences in fear of failure and psychological well-being between family and non-family businesses, and whether emotional intelligence and social capital moderate the relationship between fear of failure and psychological well-being in both groups. The proposed model was tested on data from 110 family-owned and 98 non-family-owned small enterprises in three major cities in Iran (Tehran, Isfahan, and Tabriz). The results of multiple regression analysis indicate that fear of failure is negatively associated with job satisfaction and positively related to perceived work stress; we further find that emotional intelligence weakens the association of fear of failure with psychological well-being in both study groups, especially in the family-owned business group. Contrary to our expectations, we find a weaker moderating effect of social capital on the link between fear of failure and psychological well-being among family owners. Implications of these findings for research and practice are discussed. ? 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-84960232733

However when multiple abnormalities are present, combining individual measurements can be subjective. This study sought to create a simple echo score that summarises measurements that may detect early and prognostically important changes in cardiac function. Methods Standard echocardiography was performed on 849 people with T2DM (median age 65 years, 40% female, median duration of diabetes 5.5 years). Principal components analysis was performed on measurements of LV mass, LA volume, E:e′, and s′, to create an objective summary score. The score was included in two Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for CV risk factors: one estimated the development of heart failure (HF) and the second estimated any CV event. Results The first two principal components represented 75% of the variation between the four echo measurements. A continuous score that represents the residual difference between these two components was derived that only requires measurement of medial E:e′ and s′. The score was significantly associated with the development of HF within four years (hazard ratio 1.34; 95% CI 1.15, 1.56). Conclusions We have developed a simple, objective score that enhances the use of echocardiography in the detection of sub-clinical cardiac disease in people with T2DM.

The aims were to identify potential areas for measuring impact (beyond nutrition) and to identify issues threatening the feasibility and evaluation of the program. Materials and methods: Weekly cooking sessions were conducted in one alternative education center over a school term. Data were collected through weekly observations, a youth focus group, and staff interview. Results: Observational data confirmed high levels of participation by students, willingness to try new foods, and enjoyment of foods prepared. Comments from the teacher and students emphasized the wider impact of the cooking sessions on positive youth development and cultural engagement, including opportunities for socio-emotional learning, team work, socializing with peers, and cultural blessings of food. Conclusion: Future studies should consider measures of positive youth development along with cooking skills and eating behaviors as potential outcomes. ? 2015 by De Gruyter 2015.",alternative education; cooking; culinary skills,alternative education; Article; child nutrition; cooking; education; feasibility study; feeding behavior; food processing; human; learning; New Zealand; program development; program feasibility; social interaction; socialization; teamwork; wellbeing; adolescent; cooking; feeding behavior; health promotion; information processing; interview; nutritional science; problem based learning; procedures; program evaluation; psychology; school; student; university; Adolescent; Child Nutrition Sciences; Cooking; Faculty; Feasibility Studies; Focus Groups; Food Habits; Health Promotion; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Problem-Based Learning; Program Evaluation; Schools; Students,2-s2.0-84946731340

The incidence varies hugely, up to 100%, depending on country and subpopulation. The dropout rate in the United States is 10–50%, depending on when, where, and how it is reckoned, with daily absences at a similar rate. The first line of improvement worldwide is to have sufficient schools and teachers, and adequate community will. In developed countries, many methods of keeping adolescents regularly at school are widely reported but not well evaluated. Issues arise when adolescents find school pointless and leaving attractive. Prevention and intervention programs with the most promise invest in activities that make school attractive and improve specific positive images of the future, whether immediate or in adulthood. This may counteract low self–efficacy related to school events. Strong family support is protective, though not guaranteed to be either sufficient or necessary. A number of large scale school–wide programs have claimed some level of success through comprehensive systems change efforts. Many target specific populations, for example: Immigrants, ethnic minorities. Some simple differences, under bureaucratic control, could achieve large effects: Smaller secondary schools; start the school day later and extend total hours; put more learning under the control of students. ?

Many preterm babies now survive and grow up to have normal lives, but the smaller they are, the greater the challenges in establishing milk feeds. Nutrition for these tiny babies is critically important: they are born at a time when the brain is undergoing the most rapid growth of any time during life. Inadequate nutrition results in poor growth, including poor brain growth, and this is associated with poorer long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes. Unfortunately, faltering postnatal growth is the norm for many of these vulnerable babies, largely due to the difficulties in providing adequate protein intake in the first fewdays after birth. This results in an accumulating nitrogen deficit that is difficult to rescue. There are some relatively simple nutritional strategies that can be used to improve early protein intake, including concentrated standardized intravenous nutrition solutions commenced as soon as possible after birth, early initiation of enteral feeding with more rapid advancement of feeds as tolerated, early use of human milk fortifiers, and higher target feed volumes. We have shown through observational studies that using these strategies achieves currently recommended protein intakes in early life and prevents the downward crossing of centiles for weight that are almost universally reported for extremely-low-birth-weight babies. However, high-quality randomized controlled trials with a clinically important primary outcome are required to address definitively the role of higher protein nutrition in early life on long-term outcome. Such a trial currently is recruiting in New Zealand and should report within 5 years, with survival free of neurodisability at 2 years of age as themain outcome variable.

Although no one argues that individuals are the main players in changing society and the environment, individuals have always been treated as just actors and decision makers who transform the organizational, societal, national, and/or global sustainability practices. However, our fundamental belief is that individual and personal sustainability are at the heart of organizational and societal sustainability. One of the key activities that humans undertake that has an overwhelming influence on the economic, environmental, and health facets of their life is shopping. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using the concepts and principles of decision-making, habit formation, social networks, and benchmarking to influence consumer behavior towards sustainable shopping.

Elevation of arterial CO2 levels increases this risk. CO2 retention may occur during the deep working phases of dives, but it has not been investigated in ' real world ' dives at the end of resting decompression when oxygen exposures are peaking, often to levels higher than recommended maxima. METHODS: We conducted an observational field study to measure end tidal CO2 (Pet CO2) in divers surfacing after decompression. Sixteen rebreather divers conducted two dives and two completed one dive (a total of 34 dives) to depths ranging from 44-55 msw. Bottom times ranged from 35 to 56 min and time spent on decompression ranged from 40 to 92 min. The first breaths on reaching the surface after removing the rebreather mouthpiece were taken through a portable capnograph. The Pet CO2 was recorded for the first breath that produced a clean capnography trace. Pet CO2 measurement was repeated for each subject 2-3 h after diving to give paired observations. RESULTS: There were no differences between mean surfacing Pet CO2 [36.8 mmHg (SD 3.0)] and the mean Pet CO2 made later after diving [36.9 mmHg (SD 4.0)].

The questionnaire included 18 questions on demographics, insurance status, perceptions of private insurance for pharmaceuticals and confidence in the public health system. Forty six percent of respondents had private health insurance. Respondents were more likely to have private health insurance as household income increased, and confidence in the public health system decreased. (Over two thirds of respondents were either confident or very confident in the public health system). Nineteen percent had private health insurance for pharmaceuticals, and the likelihood was not affected by household income or confidence in the public health system. Sixty one percent believed private insurance for pharmaceuticals would increase availability and affordability of pharmaceuticals. However, just over half were willing to pay for private insurance for pharmaceuticals. Of these, over two thirds were only willing to pay $20 per year or less.

Gossipy was defined as having five or more photographs of celebrities on the front cover and most gossipy as having up to 10 such images.Interventions The magazines were marked with a unique number on the back cover, placed in three piles in the waiting room, and monitored twice weekly.Main outcome measures Disappearance of magazines less than 2 months old versus magazines 3-12 months old, the overall rate of loss of magazines, and the rate of loss of gossipy versus non-gossipy magazines.Results 47 of the 82 magazines with a visible date on the front cover were aged less than 2 months. 28 of these 47 (60%) magazines and 10 of the 35 (29%) older magazines disappeared (P=0.002). After 31 days, 41 of the 87 (47%, 95% confidence interval 37% to 58%) magazines had disappeared. None of the 19 non-gossipy magazines (the Economist and Time magazine) had disappeared compared with 26 of the 27 (96%) gossipy magazines (P<0.001). All 15 of the most gossipy magazines and all 19 of the non-gossipy magazines had disappeared by 31 days. The study was terminated at this point.Conclusions General practice waiting rooms contain mainly old magazines. This phenomenon relates to the disappearance of the magazines rather than to the supply of old ones. Gossipy magazines were more likely to disappear than non-gossipy ones. On the grounds of cost we advise practices to supply old copies of non-gossipy magazines.

Pectins are abundant in many fruits and higher plants such as citrus, apples, pears and carrots, and have long been used as food additives or as active/stabilising components of pharmaceutical and cosmetic products. Global annual use of pectins is estimated at around 45 million kilograms, with a market value exceeding 400 million. The positive physiological effect of pectins (mainly as soluble dietary fibers) on humans stimulates manufacturing opportunities for novel pectin fibre ingredients and derived functional foods. However, ensuring that the desirable biological functionality and food processing properties of pectins are retained during product manufacturing remains a challenge. This chapter explores novel approaches for manipulating and optimising the positive role(s) of pectins in food processing and digestion based on pectins' sensitivity to pH, temperature, enzymes and other matrix factors. Several case studies, such as pectins' inhibitory effects on the activity of lipase enzymes and pectin's role in preservation of ascorbic acid and other phytochemicals during food processing, will be used to highlight key concepts. Plant origin, extraction method and degree of methyl esterification, acetylation and amidation of pectin ingredients determine finished food quality attributes as well as bioactive content and activities. The importance of advanced characterisation techniques, such as SEM, FT-IR, HPLC, GC, rheometry, cyclic voltammetry and solid-state NMR spectroscopy, in addition to conventional chemical analysis assays, for evaluating the suitability of a pectin ingredient for a specific functional food application, is demonstrated. The future outlook suggests that pectins will be increasingly utilised as soluble fibers for conventional food systems, and also as encapsulants for bioactive delivery systems. It is expected that 'designer pectins' such as those enriched in uronic acid or oligosaccharide fractions, or having specific methylation or branching degree to confer desirable health-promoting functionality (e.g. preserving antioxidants and enhancing prebiotic effects) will gain increased market share in the food ingredient sector. ? 2014 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-84955144703

In the immature GIT of infants, the mucosal barrier is underdeveloped. Following weaning, bacterial communities in the GIT undergo dramatic shifts in composition. These compositional and associated biochemical changes may have long-lasting impacts on the GIT mucosa and elsewhere in the body. In adults, while the microbiota is resilient, stress and diseases transiently change the composition of the GIT microbiota and this has been associated with compromised GIT function. In the aged, GIT function progressively deteriorates and these changes are considered risk factors for disease development.

Method Twenty-four patients receiving SCS therapy were interviewed. Four psychological variables were assessed using standardised questionnaires for pain catastrophising, health locus of control, anxiety sensitivity, and self-efficacy. Patients also completed the revised version of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire, the Short-Form Health Survey, and self-reported measures of global perceived effect, pain, functionality, and satisfaction with SCS therapy. Results Most patients reported improvements in pain, functionality, and improvement overall. Some health locus of control dimensions were significantly higher for the angina group than the chronic pain group, and chronic angina patients reported significantly lower levels of intermittent pain. Virtually all patients reported being satisfied with SCS therapy. Conclusion Most self-rated psychological and pain-related characteristics were no different between the two groups, which gives some support to the view that refractory angina is a form of chronic pain. The results also add to evidence supporting the use of SCS therapy for refractory angina pectoris; however, differences observed on a few variables may indicate points of focus for the assessment and treatment of such patients. ?

However, the expectations surrounding the explanatory role of genomic variation have become somewhat deflated following the rather modest effect sizes of gene variants discovered from genome-wide association studies of metabolic diseases. For example, while fat mass and obesity-associated (FTO) gene polymorphisms have an impact on satiety and affect predisposition to obesity, the association accounts for less than 0.5% of overall variance in body mass index (BMI). Meanwhile, public health strategies predominantly focusing on diet and exercise have been relatively ineffective in stemming the relentless rise in obesity rates worldwide. ? 2014 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,2-s2.0-85054274142

Below this level, there is generally greater CVD risk in persons because of chronic underlying diseases, heavy cigarette smoking, or malnutrition. Above this cutoff, there is a positive association between BMI and risk for CVD morbidity and mortality. Table 46.1 shows the summary results from a meta-analysis that included >300,000 adults and used a BMI ? 25 kg/m2 as the referent group. They reported a 32% increase in CVD risk for persons with BMI = 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 (relative risk of 1.32) and an 81% greater risk among persons with BMI > 30 kg/m2 (relative risk of 1.81).

Methods: In the New Zealand National Shared Care Planning Programme (NSCPP) evaluation, we used a range of measurements indicative of programme impact. The number of general practitioner (GP) claims and hospital attendances, as well as medication dispensing and laboratory testing utilisation records were compared before and after programme commencement. The hospital length of stay (LoS) was compared between NSCPP-enrolled participants and similar participants in the community with the same at risk for re-hospitalisation probability score. The NSCPP programme activities were also examined with relation to LoS. Results: Even with small sample size and short duration of the intervention to date, significant increases in medication dispensed, and reduction in GP claims, emergency department, inpatient admissions and outpatient visits were observed. In addition, shorter hospital stay is associated with larger care teams. Discussion: Reduced GP and hospital encounters are indicative of changes in service utilisation towards planned and shared care; improvements in medication adherence suggest positive trends towards better self-management. In conclusion, we find it feasible to analyse health service utilisation data to gain insights regarding complex and multi-faceted shared care impact.",,controlled study; doctor patient relation; emergency ward; general practitioner; health care utilization; hospitalization; human; human experiment; information processing; length of stay; medication compliance; New Zealand; outpatient; probability; program impact; sample size; self care,2-s2.0-85016557508

Primary infection with EBV typically occurs subclinically between the ages of one and six, after which the virus latently inhabits B lymphocyte cells. Previous infection with EBV is indicated by the presence of EBV antibody titres in the serum, while lack of these antibodies indicates vulnerability to EBV infection (Kasl et al., 1979). In the Western world, a second peak of EBV infection occurs between 14 and 20 years of age. Estimates suggest that 90% of the world’s population are seropositive for EBV by the age of 30 and carry the virus as a lifelong latent infection (Papesch and Watkins, 2001). Epstein–Barr virus and infectious mononucleosis When people get infected with EBV, a number seroconvert without developing the clinical signs of IM. Those who develop the clinical syndrome experience an acute illness characterized by fatigue, sore throat, tender lymph nodes and fever, which usually resolves within two to four weeks (Rea et al., 2001). The puzzle is why some infected individuals develop clinical IM while others do not. In an attempt to answer this question, Kasl and colleagues (1979) investigated 432 young American cadets over a four-year period. ? Cambridge University Press 2007.",,,2-s2.0-84952938124

These include the use of automated cytology scanning for abnormal cells in cervical smears, mammographic techniques for the early detection of breast tumours, and the use of genetic screening methods to detect various cancers which are to a greater or lesser degree genetically determined (e.g. some breast and colonic cancers) (see ‘Screening: cancer’). Such developments notwithstanding, there remains a potential role for self-examination procedures since (a) there remain many cancers for which technological procedures are not available (b) some procedures involve elements of risk, for example, the use of ionizing radiation in mammography, which limit the frequency with which they can be applied and (c) practical constraints may limit the applicability of the procedures to only a subset of those at risk. For example, in the UK some 1 in 12 women will have breast cancer at some point in their lives, but for a number of reasons, (including logistical reasons and variation in the characteristics of the disease in women of different ages), screening by invitation is currently available only once every three years, and only to women in the 50–64 age group (with plans for extension up to age 70 in the near future).

When this response was first being elucidated, the cellular and molecular interactions involving T and B lymphocytes (main cells of the immune system), antibodies (antigen-specific effector molecules) and cytokines (immune regulatory hormones) were thought to operate virtually autonomously within the body, influenced predominantly by the internal state of the immune network and the characteristics of antigens (foreign shapes derived from infectious agents). However, individual differences in susceptibility to infection and effectiveness of immunity following vaccination, led to exploration of non-physiological factors. Research using laboratory animals demonstrated that ‘lifestyle’ factors such as overcrowding (Edwards & Dean, 1977) and exposure to physically stressful conditions (Sheridan, 1998) reduced immune responses to immunization often to the point that the animals become susceptible to infection. Such studies extended into the human arena have confirmed that many aspects of human psychology affect immune responses to vaccination and should be considered as significant factors in vaccine effectiveness. Research evidence Stress and immunization When healthy women were immunized with a novel antigen, keyhole limpet haemocyanin (KLH), those reporting more stressful events had lower baseline and post-immunization lymphocyte proliferation (Snyder et al., 1993) and anti-KLH antibody levels in their blood, while those reporting more social support had higher responses (Snyder et al., 1990; Snyder et al., 1993). ?

The motility of the gastrointestinal tract is underpinned by an electrophysiological event called slow wave activity. Many other physiological factors, such as neural and hormonal factors, also present a significant level of regulation on both slow waves and motility. In recent years, high-resolution electrical mapping has yielded significant insight to the organization of slow wave activity in-vivo, both in normal as well as pathological conditions. One significant experimental finding has been the description of slow wave dysrhythmias recorded from patients with clinically significant digestive diseases such as diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis. Accompanying these new findings regarding slow wave activity is a series of mathematical models that have been applied to perform predictive simulations capable of giving further insights to the mechanistic behaviors of slow waves under different physiological conditions. In particular, the multi-scale modeling approach has been utilized to great success to integrate experimental data from multiple recording modalities and infer the relationship between slow waves and gastrointestinal functions. Ultimately, the research efforts aim to develop a ""virtual stomach"" for simulation of how food is digested and how different pathological factors can influence digestive health. ?

The mischief was to remove the need for a claimant to prove a health practitioner's or organization's negligence to establish cover. The aim was to provide greater fairness for claimants, faster claims handling and a higher acceptance rate. A disturbing aspect of the case law interpreting the treatment injury criteria is that notions of negligence have crept back into the interpretation of these criteria and are becoming entrenched. The original purpose of the reform is in danger of miscarrying, unless these misguided interpretations are corrected by superior appellate courts. This is not simply a matter of being faithful to the intention of the reform but is necessary to maximize provider trust and cooperation in the claims process in the interests of claimants. A way to do this is to incorporate the concept of 'preventability' as defined in the Swedish, Danish and Finnish patient insurance schemes. It may prove impossible to eradicate fault altogether from treatment injury, but vigilance is required so that negligence is kept to a minimum. Negligence concepts might continue to play a role in the interpretation of the statutory exclusion from cover of personal injury that is an 'ordinary consequence' of treatment. Another is in relation to Accident Compensation Corporation's (ACC's) mandatory duty to report a risk of harm to the public. Any enthusiasm on behalf of ACC and the courts to 'bring back negligence' is ironically absent from the latter aspect of the scheme. ?

Differences in resulting clusters are described to provide insight into the population. Results: 1786 Pacific patients were identified with high CVR (? 10%, 5 year event risk) at baseline and were still enrolled with the thirteen participating general practices at CDM end. Two of three models attempted produced significant clusters: a two-cluster model indicating patients who failed to improve adherence during the programme had higher prevalence of diabetes; and a three-cluster model where one cluster was characterised by higher but improving blood pressure, and another characterised by higher but improving HbA1c.

Results indicate that domains of HRQOL may be degraded in those living in areas more likely to induce noise annoyance.

More recently social media has been used to connect vendors and consumers together to discover, share, recommend and transact goods and services. However there is a paucity of academic literature on sustainable social shopping as well as systems in industry to support the same. There is no single online shopping system that provides a holistic shopping experience to customers that allows them to balance financial, health, and environmental dimensions. To address this lacuna we propose Sustainable Social Shopping Systems as a means by which we can practically support individuals to become more sustainable and ultimately transform their lives.

However, due to high cost it is impractical to monitor all bridges within a network. Bridges which are exposed to increased hazards, are vulnerable and have high failure consequences pose the greatest risk to network functionality should they fail in a seismic event, and would therefore benefit the most from implementation of monitoring systems and quick condition assessment methodologies. This paper outlines a methodology to prioritise bridges for monitoring and quick condition assessment based on their seismic risk. The methodology uses four factors to determine risk, i.e. seismic hazard, vulnerability, failure impact and uncertainty of available data and assessment methods. The hazard factor accounts for the seismicity levels at bridge sites and length of time of exposure to hazard. Structural and geotechnical aspects have been combined to determine the vulnerability of each bridge. Impacts quantify the consequences of bridge failure on safety and network functionality. The uncertainty premium accounts for the quality, variability and limitations of data and risk assessment methods used. The overall risk calculated for each bridge within a stock enables prioritisation of structures for monitoring and quick post-disaster assessment. The whole spectrum of approaches to bridge monitoring and condition evaluation comprises bridge specific monitoring data used for quick and accurate analyses for the most critical, high risk bridges; data sourced from wide-area strong motion arrays used for quick but less accurate assessment for medium risk structures; and traditional visual inspection based assessment of low risk bridges. A discrete scoring system was adopted and detailed tables that enable scoring the hazards, vulnerabilities, impacts and data and assessment uncertainties developed. The proposed methodology was applied to a selection of bridges from the city of Wellington, New Zealand to test its applicability and performance. A comparative study with another seismic risk assessment method was also conducted. The results showed that the methodology effectively prioritised bridges depending on seismic risk. The methodology was also able to determine if risk at a particular bridge site was predominantly related to hazard, structural vulnerability, geotechnical vulnerability or impact. The methodology is simple, quick and flexible and can be adapted based on the level of accuracy required. The uncertainty premium allows risk to be determined given variable data and assessment method quality which has the benefit of being able to tailor data collection and assessment to the needs of each network and available resources. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bridges; Condition assessment; Disaster response; Risk; Road networks; Structural health monitoring,"Bridges; Condition monitoring; Disasters; Earthquake effects; Hazards; Health risks; Risks; Seismic design; Structural health monitoring; Condition assessments; Disaster response; Discrete scoring systems; Risk assessment methods; Road network; Seismic risk assessment; Structural vulnerability; Wellington , New Zealand; Risk assessment",2-s2.0-84919726892

An absolute lymphocyte count is commonly used as an alternative to a CD4 count to determine initiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV-infected individuals in Fiji when a CD4 count is unavailable. Methods. We conducted a retrospective analysis of laboratory results of HIV-infected individuals registered at all HIV clinics in Fiji. Results. Paired absolute lymphocyte and CD4 counts were available for 101 HIV-infected individuals, and 96% had a CD4 count of ?500 cells/mm3. Correlation between the counts in individuals was poor (Spearman rank correlation r = 0.5). No absolute lymphocyte count could be determined in this population as a suitable surrogate for a CD4 count of either 350 cells/mm3 or 500 cells/mm3. The currently used absolute lymphocyte count of ?2300 cells/L had a positive predictive value of 87% but a negative predictive value of only 17% for a CD4 of ?350 cells/mm3 and if used as a surrogate for a CD4 of ?500 cells/mm3 it would result in all HIV-infected individuals receiving ART including those not yet eligible. Weight, CD4 count, and absolute lymphocyte count increased significantly at 3 months following ART initiation. Conclusions. Our findings do not support the use of absolute lymphocyte count to determine antiretroviral therapy initiation in Fiji. ? 2014 Dashika A.

Applications include hydrocarbon and geothermal reservoirs, as well as subsurface carbon sequestration. The hypocenters of microseismic activity help identify individual faults, fault systems, and associated structures. In energy extraction this info aids siting production wells, increasing the odds that fluid-conducting faults are tapped. Full-waveform correlations help further discriminate events in clusters obtained from coherent phases only. The detail in the coda is what distinguishes small differences in location and/or source signatures; detail that cannot be extracted from (travel times of) coherent phases alone. We illustrate these approaches with data from a permanent vertical borehole array that recorded over 3800?microseismic events in 2008 and 2009 at the Aneth field, Utah (USA). Differences in the power spectra of individual microseismic events from a cluster are small, but consistent in terms of their spatial distribution. Also, these results were consistent with re-clustering based on correlations of the full waveforms. As a result, we suggest these events should be sub-clustered before further relocation with more advanced techniques, such as double difference tomography.",,Geothermal fields; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Carbon sequestration; Double-difference tomography; Energy extraction; Fluid-conducting faults; Geothermal reservoir; Microseismic events; Production wells; Vertical borehole; Seismology,2-s2.0-84907382991

With no cure currently in sight, the only effective treatments for OA are orthopaedic surgery and prolonged rehabilitation, neither of which is guaranteed to succeed. Gait retraining has tremendous potential to alter the contact forces in the joints due to walking, reducing the risk of one developing hip and knee OA. Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) are being explored as a potential way of applying intuitive haptic feedback to alter a patient's walking gait. The main challenge with the use of DEAs in this application is producing large enough forces and strains to induce sensation when coupled to a patient's skin. A novel controller has been proposed to solve this issue. The controller uses simultaneous capacitive self-sensing and actuation which will optimally apply a haptic sensation to the patient's skin independent of variability in DEAs and patient geometries. ? 2014 SPIE.",artificial muscles; dielectric elastomer; haptic; resonance; tactile; vibration,Joints (anatomy); Muscle; Resonance; Artificial muscle; Dielectric elastomers; haptic; tactile; vibration; Electroactive polymer actuators,2-s2.0-84905569715

The framework includes indicator-based tools that correspond to the three categories of rights obligations: respecting health rights by designing with a full understanding of the health system; fulfilling health rights by designing available, accessible, acceptable, and quality services; and protecting health rights by conducting a health systems impact assessment to ensure the health system is not weakened by program demands. The tools within this rights-based framework can assist the design of global health initiatives so that they work to strengthen health systems and meet rights obligations. ? 2014 by The Johns Hopkins University Press.",,,2-s2.0-84901024430

It is now evident that neurogenesis does occur in a wide range of areas in the adult brain in several mammalian species. A multitude of factors seems to have an influential role in the process of neurogenesis. This review focuses on some historical aspects and principles and procedures in the context of neurogenesis. The role of stress in neurogenesis is highlighted. Potential applications of neurogenesis in clinical medicine are discussed. ? 2014 by Begell House, Inc.",Neurogenesis; Neuroprotection; Plasticity; Stress; Synaptogenesis,neurotransmitter; neurotrophic factor; sex hormone; stress hormone; Alzheimer disease; article; cell survival; chronic stress; clinical medicine; depression; environmental enrichment; human; major depression; nerve cell differentiation; nerve cell plasticity; nervous system development; neural stem cell; neuroprotection; nonhuman; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; schizophrenia; sleep deprivation; sleep disordered breathing; social environment; social isolation; social stress; stress; synaptogenesis,2-s2.0-84899699444

Methods: 108 adults in advanced age were recruited. Data were collected through a standardised questionnaire including a measure of physical activity, comprehensive physical assessment and fasting blood samples. CVD events at follow-up were ascertained from hospital records. Results: Sixty-seven per cent of participants had CVD at baseline. Physical activity (OR (95% CI): 0.99 (0.98-1.0); P = 0.04) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (OR (95% CI): 0.3 (0.09-1.0); P = 0.046) were independently associated with CVD. The 28-month incidence rate of CVD was 6 cases/100 person-years. Baseline diastolic BP (OR (95% CI): 0.9 (0.9-1.0); P = 0.03) and waist circumference (OR (95% CI): 1.06 (1.01-1.1); P = 0.01) were independently associated with subsequent CVD events at follow-up. Conclusion: Physical activity and HDL levels were inversely associated with CVD at baseline but did not predict future CVD events. CVD in advanced age warrants further investigation. ? 2012 ACOTA.",Aged; Cardiovascular disease; HDL; Physical activity,"aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; epidemiology; female; follow up; geriatric assessment; human; male; morbidity; New Zealand; procedures; prognosis; prospective study; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; trends; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Male; Morbidity; New Zealand; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-84896547159

Over the last 2 decades, different antioxidant therapies have been developed to improve outcomes in septic patients. According to recent evidence, selenium therapy should be considered the cornerstone of the antioxidant strategies. Selenium given as selenious acid or sodium selenite should be considered as a drug or pharmaconutrient with prooxidant and cytotoxic effects when a loading dose in intravenous bolus form is administered, particularly in the early stage of severe sepsis/septic shock. To date, several phase ii trials have demonstrated that selenium therapy may be able to decrease mortality, improve organ dysfunction and reduce infections in critically ill septic patients. The effect of selenium therapy in sepsis syndrome must be confirmed by large, well designed phase iii clinical trials. The purpose of this review is to discuss current evidence on selenium pharmaconutrition in sepsis syndrome. ? 2013 Elsevier Espa?a, S.L. and SEMICYUC.",Critically ill; Oxidative stress; Pharmaconutrition; Selenium; Sepsis,"selenium; antioxidant; glutathione peroxidase; selenious acid; selenium; sodium selenite; antioxidant activity; evidence based medicine; human; information processing; intensive care unit; oxidative stress; parenteral nutrition; sepsis; short survey; animal; animal model; APACHE; blood; critical illness; drug effects; infusion; intensive care; meta analysis (topic); multiple organ failure; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); systemic inflammatory response syndrome; treatment outcome; Animals; Antioxidants; APACHE; Clinical Trials, Phase I as Topic; Clinical Trials, Phase II as Topic; Critical Care; Critical Illness; Glutathione Peroxidase; Humans; Infusions, Parenteral; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Models, Animal; Multiple Organ Failure; Oxidative Stress; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Selenious Acid; Selenium; Sodium Selenite; Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84896390348
