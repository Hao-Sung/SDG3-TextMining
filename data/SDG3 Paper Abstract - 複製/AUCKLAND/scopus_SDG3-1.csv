Monitoring marketing exposures supports informed policymaking. This study presents a global overview of children's television advertising exposure to healthy and unhealthy products. Twenty-two countries contributed data, captured between 2008 and 2017. Advertisements were coded for the nature of foods and beverages, using the 2015 World Health Organization (WHO) Europe Nutrient Profile Model (should be permitted/not-permitted to be advertised). Peak viewing times were defined as the top five hour timeslots for children. On average, there were four times more advertisements for foods/beverages that should not be permitted than for permitted foods/beverages. The frequency of food/beverages advertisements that should not be permitted per hour was higher during peak viewing times compared with other times (P?<?0.001). During peak viewing times, food and beverage advertisements that should not be permitted were higher in countries with industry self-regulatory programmes for responsible advertising compared with countries with no policies. Globally, children are exposed to a large volume of television advertisements for unhealthy foods and beverages, despite the implementation of food industry programmes. Governments should enact regulation to protect children from television advertising of unhealthy products that undermine their health. ? 2019 The Authors.

The Food-EPI was applied in 11 countries across six regions (2015-2018). National public health nutrition panels (n?=?11-101 experts) rated the extent of implementation of 47 policy and infrastructure support good practice indicators by their government(s) against best practices, using an evidence document verified by government officials. Experts identified and prioritized actions to address implementation gaps. The proportion of indicators at “very low if any,” “low,” “medium,” and “high” implementation, overall Food-EPI scores, and priority action areas were compared across countries. Inter-rater reliability was good (GwetAC2?=?0.6-0.8). Chile had the highest proportion of policies (13%) rated at “high” implementation, while Guatemala had the highest proportion of policies (83%) rated at “very low if any” implementation. The overall Food-EPI score was “medium” for Australia, England, Chile, and Singapore, while “very low if any” for Guatemala. Policy areas most frequently prioritized included taxes on unhealthy foods, restricting unhealthy food promotion and front-of-pack labelling. The Food-EPI was found to be a robust tool and process to benchmark governments' progress to create healthy food environments. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation",accountability; benchmarking; food environments; policy implementation,article; Australia; benchmarking; Chile; clinical article; England; government employee; Guatemala; human; interrater reliability; nutrition policy; public health; Singapore; tax,2-s2.0-85059533802

Participatory methods increasingly used in healthcare improvement coalesce around the concept of coproduction, and related practices of cocreation, codesign and coinnovation. These participatory methods have become the new Zeitgeist-the spirit of our times in quality improvement. The rationale for this new spirit of participation relates to voice and engagement (those with lived experience should be engaged in processes of development, redesign and improvements), empowerment (engagement in codesign and coproduction has positive individual and societal benefits) and advancement (quality of life and other health outcomes and experiences of services for everyone involved should improve as a result). This paper introduces Mental Health Experience Co-design (MH ECO), a peer designed and led adapted form of Experience-based Co-design (EBCD) developed in Australia. MH ECO is said to facilitate empowerment, foster trust, develop autonomy, self-determination and choice for people living with mental illnesses and their carers, including staff at mental health services. Little information exists about the underlying mechanisms of change; the entities, processes and structures that underpin MH ECO and similar EBCD studies. To address this, we identified eight possible mechanisms from an assessment of the activities and outcomes of MH ECO and a review of existing published evaluations. The eight mechanisms, recognition, dialogue, cooperation, accountability, mobilisation, enactment, creativity and attainment, are discussed within an explanatory theoretical model of change' that details these and ideal relational transitions that might be observed or not with MH ECO or other EBCD studies. We critically appraise the sociocultural and political movement in coproduction and draw on interdisciplinary theories from the humanities-narrative theory, dialogical ethics, cooperative and empowerment theory. The model advances theoretical thinking in coproduction beyond motivations and towards identifying underlying processes and entities that might impact on process and outcome.

Evolutionary hypotheses for female nonheterosexuality have failed to fully account for the existence of these different categories of nonheterosexual women, while also overlooking broader data on the causal mechanisms, physiology, ontogeny, and phylogeny of female nonheterosexuality. We review the evolutionary-developmental origins of various phenotypes in the female sexual orientation spectrum using the synergistic approach of Tinbergen’s four questions. We also present femme-specific and butch-specific hypotheses at proximate and ultimate levels of analysis. This review article indicates that various nonheterosexual female phenotypes emerge from and contribute to hormonally mediated fast life history strategies. Life history theory provides a biobehavioral explanatory framework for nonheterosexual women’s masculinized body morphology, psychological dispositions, and their elevated likelihood of experiencing violence, substance use, obesity, teenage pregnancy, and lower general health. This pattern of life outcomes can create a feedback loop of environmental unpredictability and harshness which destabilizes intrauterine hormonal conditions in mothers, leading to a greater likelihood of fast life history strategies, global health problems, and nonheterosexual preferences in female offspring. We further explore the potential of female nonheterosexuality to function as an alloparental buffer that enables masculinizing alleles to execute their characteristic fast life history strategies as they appear in the female and the male phenotype. Synthesizing life history theory with the female sexual orientation spectrum enriches existing scientific knowledge on the evolutionary-developmental mechanisms of human sex differences. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Behavioral endocrinology; Evolutionary-developmental psychology; Female sexual orientation; Homosexuality; Life history evolution; Neurodevelopment; Women’s health,,2-s2.0-85053530844

The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms with human readers for all clinically relevant types of benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions. Methods: For this open, web-based, international, diagnostic study, human readers were asked to diagnose dermatoscopic images selected randomly in 30-image batches from a test set of 1511 images. The diagnoses from human readers were compared with those of 139 algorithms created by 77 machine-learning labs, who participated in the International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 challenge and received a training set of 10 015 images in advance. The ground truth of each lesion fell into one of seven predefined disease categories: intraepithelial carcinoma including actinic keratoses and Bowen's disease; basal cell carcinoma; benign keratinocytic lesions including solar lentigo, seborrheic keratosis and lichen planus-like keratosis; dermatofibroma; melanoma; melanocytic nevus; and vascular lesions. The two main outcomes were the differences in the number of correct specific diagnoses per batch between all human readers and the top three algorithms, and between human experts and the top three algorithms. Findings: Between Aug 4, 2018, and Sept 30, 2018, 511 human readers from 63 countries had at least one attempt in the reader study. 283 (55·4%) of 511 human readers were board-certified dermatologists, 118 (23·1%) were dermatology residents, and 83 (16·2%) were general practitioners. When comparing all human readers with all machine-learning algorithms, the algorithms achieved a mean of 2·01 (95% CI 1·97 to 2·04; p<0·0001) more correct diagnoses (17·91 [SD 3·42] vs 19·92 [4·27]). 27 human experts with more than 10 years of experience achieved a mean of 18·78 (SD 3·15) correct answers, compared with 25·43 (1·95) correct answers for the top three machine algorithms (mean difference 6·65, 95% CI 6·06–7·25; p<0·0001). The difference between human experts and the top three algorithms was significantly lower for images in the test set that were collected from sources not included in the training set (human underperformance of 11·4%, 95% CI 9·9–12·9 vs 3·6%, 0·8–6·3; p<0·0001). Interpretation: State-of-the-art machine-learning classifiers outperformed human experts in the diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions and should have a more important role in clinical practice. However, a possible limitation of these algorithms is their decreased performance for out-of-distribution images, which should be addressed in future research.

Total pancreas volume (TPV) and pancreas diameters are often reduced in advanced CP but have never been studied after AP. The objective of this study was to investigate pancreas size after clinical resolution of AP and its association with the number of AP attacks. Methods: Individuals with a history of AP were grouped based on the number of attacks (1, 2, ? 3 attacks). Healthy individuals were also recruited. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging, from which TPV and pancreas diameters (across the head, body, and tail) were measured independently by two raters in a blinded fashion. Generalised additive models (including age, sex, body mass index, and glycated haemoglobin levels) were used. Results: A total of 123 participants were studied. Total pancreas volume and tail diameter were significantly reduced in both unadjusted (TPV (p = 0.036), tail diameter (p = 0.009)) and adjusted (TPV (p = 0.026), tail diameter (p = 0.034)) models in individuals with ? 3 attacks, but not with 1 or 2 attacks, compared with healthy individuals. Head and body diameters did not differ significantly. Conclusions: Reduced TPV and tail diameter characterise individuals after ? 3 attacks of AP and may represent one of the earliest irreversible morphological changes in individuals after AP. A high-risk population for transition to CP might include individuals with at least 3 attacks of AP whereas those with less than 3 attacks might be at a low risk. Key Points: ? A significant reduction in total pancreas volume was demonstrated in individuals after 3 or more attacks of acute pancreatitis (without conventional signs of chronic pancreatitis). ? Pancreas tail diameter, but not head or body diameter, was reduced in individuals after 3 or more attacks of acute pancreatitis (without conventional signs of chronic pancreatitis). ? The above findings were independent of age, sex, body mass index, and glycated haemoglobin levels. ? 2019, European Society of Radiology.",Magnetic resonance imaging; Pancreas; Pancreatitis; Recurrence,glycosylated hemoglobin; acute pancreatitis; adult; aged; Article; cross-sectional study; female; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pancreas; priority journal; recurrent disease; acute disease; disease exacerbation; follow up; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pancreas; pancreatitis; pathology; procedures; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreas; Pancreatitis; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; ROC Curve,2-s2.0-85064340770

Design: A randomised placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Thirteen maternal–fetal medicine units across New Zealand and Australia. Population: Women with singleton pregnancies affected by fetal growth restriction at 22+0 to 29+6 weeks. Methods: Women were randomised to oral administration of 25 mg sildenafil citrate or visually matching placebo three times daily until 32+0 weeks, birth or fetal death (whichever occurred first). Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of pregnancies with an increase in fetal growth velocity. Secondary outcomes included live birth, survival to hospital discharge free of major neonatal morbidity and pre-eclampsia. Results: Sildenafil did not affect the proportion of pregnancies with an increase in fetal growth velocity; 32/61 (52.5%) sildenafil-treated, 39/57 (68.4%) placebo-treated [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.23–1.05] and had no effect on abdominal circumference Z-scores (P = 0.61). Sildenafil use was associated with a lower mean uterine artery pulsatility index after 48 hours of treatment (1.56 versus 1.81; P = 0.02). The live birth rate was 56/63 (88.9%) for sildenafil-treated and 47/59 (79.7%) for placebo-treated (adjusted OR 2.50, 95% CI 0.80–7.79); survival to hospital discharge free of major neonatal morbidity was 42/63 (66.7%) for sildenafil-treated and 33/59 (55.9%) for placebo-treated (adjusted OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.84–4.45); and new-onset pre-eclampsia was 9/51 (17.7%) for sildenafil-treated and 14/55 (25.5%) for placebo-treated (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.26–1.75). Conclusions: Maternal sildenafil use had no effect on fetal growth velocity.

Through trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and independent replication (n = 1,046,070), we identified 264 associated loci (166 new). Of these, 147 were likely to be relevant for kidney function on the basis of associations with the alternative kidney function marker blood urea nitrogen (n = 416,178). Pathway and enrichment analyses, including mouse models with renal phenotypes, support the kidney as the main target organ. A genetic risk score for lower eGFR was associated with clinically diagnosed CKD in 452,264 independent individuals. Colocalization analyses of associations with eGFR among 783,978 European-ancestry individuals and gene expression across 46 human tissues, including tubulo-interstitial and glomerular kidney compartments, identified 17 genes differentially expressed in kidney. Fine-mapping highlighted missense driver variants in 11 genes and kidney-specific regulatory variants. These results provide a comprehensive priority list of molecular targets for translational research. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"citric acid; creatinine; cystatin C; cytochrome P450 1A1; fibroblast growth factor 5; GABA transporter 2; multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1; nitrogen; sodium phosphate cotransporter 2a; Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein; urate; urea; Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein; adult; allele; Article; cacna1s gene; cgnl1 gene; chromatin; chronic kidney failure; controlled study; cps1 gene; creatinine blood level; dab2 gene; dcdc1 gene; edem3 gene; estimated glomerular filtration rate; expression quantitative trait locus; female; gatm gene; gene; gene expression; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene locus; gene replication; genetic association; genetic correlation; genetic risk; genome-wide association study; hoxd11 gene; human; intron; larp4b gene; linc01512 gene; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nrg4 gene; orthology; pdilt gene; phenotype; priority journal; rpl3l gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; slc25a45 gene; target organ; tissue specificity; umod gene; urea nitrogen blood level; Caucasian; chromosomal mapping; chronic kidney failure; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; glomerulus filtration rate; inheritance; kidney function test; meta analysis; pathophysiology; procedures; quantitative trait; quantitative trait locus; urine; Chromosome Mapping; European Continental Ancestry Group; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Inheritance Patterns; Kidney Function Tests; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci; Quantitative Trait, Heritable; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Uromodulin",2-s2.0-85066607502

A newer anticonvulsant, levetiracetam, can be given more quickly, is potentially more efficacious, and has a more tolerable adverse effect profile. We aimed to determine whether phenytoin or levetiracetam is the superior second-line treatment for paediatric convulsive status epilepticus. Methods: ConSEPT was an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial conducted in 13 emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand. Children aged between 3 months and 16 years, with convulsive status epilepticus that failed first-line benzodiazepine treatment, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated permuted block (block sizes 2 and 4) randomisation sequence, stratified by site and age (?5 years, >5 years), to receive 20 mg/kg phenytoin (intravenous or intraosseous infusion over 20 min) or 40 mg/kg levetiracetam (intravenous or intraosseous infusion over 5 min). The primary outcome was clinical cessation of seizure activity 5 min after the completion of infusion of the study drug. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12615000129583. Findings: Between March 19, 2015, and Nov 29, 2017, 639 children presented to participating emergency departments with convulsive status epilepticus; 127 were missed, and 278 did not meet eligibility criteria. The parents of one child declined to give consent, leaving 233 children (114 assigned to phenytoin and 119 assigned to levetiracetam) in the intention-to-treat population. Clinical cessation of seizure activity 5 min after completion of infusion of study drug occurred in 68 (60%) patients in the phenytoin group and 60 (50%) patients in the levetiracetam group (risk difference ?9·2% [95% CI ?21·9 to 3·5]; p=0·16). One participant in the phenytoin group died at 27 days because of haemorrhagic encephalitis; this death was not thought to be due to the study drug. There were no other serious adverse events. Interpretation: Levetiracetam is not superior to phenytoin for second-line management of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus.

fetal and maternal genetic and non-genetic factors, and has been reproducibly associated with future cardio-metabolic health outcomes. In expanded genome-wide association analyses of own birth weight (n = 321,223) and offspring birth weight (n = 230,069 mothers), we identified 190 independent association signals (129 of which are novel). We used structural equation modeling to decompose the contributions of direct fetal and indirect maternal genetic effects, then applied Mendelian randomization to illuminate causal pathways. For example, both indirect maternal and direct fetal genetic effects drive the observational relationship between lower birth weight and higher later blood pressure: maternal blood pressure-raising alleles reduce offspring birth weight, but only direct fetal effects of these alleles, once inherited, increase later offspring blood pressure. Using maternal birth weight-lowering genotypes to proxy for an adverse intrauterine environment provided no evidence that it causally raises offspring blood pressure, indicating that the inverse birth weight–blood pressure association is attributable to genetic effects, and not to intrauterine programming. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,"allele; article; birth weight; blood pressure monitoring; cardiometabolic risk; controlled study; decomposition; female; fetus; genome-wide association study; genotype; human; major clinical study; maternal blood; Mendelian randomization analysis; progeny; randomized controlled trial; structural equation modeling; uterus; adult; biological model; birth weight; blood pressure; body height; fetomaternal transfusion; fetus development; genetic predisposition; genetics; heart disease; male; maternal inheritance; meta analysis; metabolic disorder; newborn; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pregnancy; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; Birth Weight; Blood Pressure; Body Height; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Fetal Development; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heart Diseases; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Inheritance; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Metabolic Diseases; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Pregnancy; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85065213720

Delirium in the postanaesthesia care unit (PACU) could predict adverse clinical outcomes. Methods: We investigated a potential link between intraoperative EEG patterns and PACU delirium as well as an association of PACU delirium with perioperative outcomes, readmission and length of hospital stay. The risk factors for PACU delirium were also explored. Data were collected from 626 patients receiving general anaesthesia for procedures that would not interfere with frontal EEG recording. Results: Of the 626 subjects enrolled, 125 tested positive for PACU delirium. Whilst age, renal failure, and pre-existing neurological disease were associated with PACU delirium in the univariable analysis, the multivariable analysis revealed the importance of information derived from the EEG, anaesthetic technique, anaesthesia duration, and history of stroke or neurodegenerative disease. The occurrence of EEG burst suppression during maintenance [odds ratio (OR)=1.86 (1.13–3.05)] and the type of EEG emergence trajectory may be predictive of PACU delirium. Specifically, EEG emergence trajectories lacking significant spindle power were strongly associated with PACU delirium, especially in cases that involved ketamine or nitrous oxide [OR=6.51 (3.00–14.12)]. Additionally, subjects with PACU delirium were at an increased risk for readmission [OR=2.17 (1.13–4.17)] and twice as likely to stay >6 days in the hospital. Conclusions: Specific EEG patterns were associated with PACU delirium. These findings provide valuable information regarding how the brain reacts to surgery and anaesthesia that may lead to strategies to predict PACU delirium and identify key areas of investigation for its prevention. ? 2018","delirium; EEG; general anaesthesia, complications; intraoperative monitoring; neurocognitive disorders; postoperative outcome; recovery room","fentanyl; hydromorphone; ketamine; morphine; nitrous oxide; adult; adverse outcome; aged; alcohol consumption; analgesia; anesthesia; Article; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical outcome; comorbidity; dementia; disease association; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography monitoring; female; follow up; general anesthesia; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; kidney failure; length of stay; major clinical study; male; maximum likelihood method; medical history; medical record review; mild cognitive impairment; morbidity; mortality risk; neurologic disease; observational study; orthopedic surgery; pain assessment; Parkinson disease; perioperative period; peroperative care; postoperative care; postoperative complication; postoperative delirium; prediction; priority journal; recovery room; risk factor; spine surgery; anesthetic recovery; clinical trial; early diagnosis; electroencephalography; emergence agitation; intraoperative monitoring; middle aged; multicenter study; procedures; prognosis; signal processing; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Anesthesia Recovery Period; Anesthesia, General; Early Diagnosis; Electroencephalography; Emergence Delirium; Female; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Patient Readmission; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",2-s2.0-85055572463

It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018. Selection criteria Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. Main results We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I 2 = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I 2 = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I 2 = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I 2 = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I 2 = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I 2 = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low-and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant-versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low-or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies. AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low-or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no evidence of an effect on cardiac AEs, SAEs or withdrawals. Rates of these were low overall. Significantly more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray in comparison to patch in one trial (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46, 922 participants; very low certainty) and in participants using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two trials (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50, 2 studies, 544 participants; I 2 = 0%; low certainty). Authors’ conclusions There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We performed a proof-of-concept study to examine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of NVR 3-778 in patients with chronic HBV infection. Methods: We performed a phase 1 study in 73 hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with chronic HBV infection without cirrhosis. In a 2-part study (part 1 in New Zealand and part 2 in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, and the United States), patients were randomly assigned to groups that were given oral NVR 3-778 (100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg daily or 600 mg or 1000 mg twice daily) or placebo for 4 weeks. Additional groups received combination treatment with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and NVR 3-778 (600 mg twice daily) or pegIFN with placebo. Results: Reductions in serum levels of HBV DNA and HBV RNA were observed in patients receiving ?1200 mg/d NVR 3-778. The largest mean reduction in HBV DNA was observed in the group given NVR 3-778 plus pegIFN (1.97 log 10 IU/mL), compared with the groups given NVR 3-778 or pegIFN alone (1.43 log 10 IU/mL and 1.06 log 10 IU/mL, respectively). The mean reduction in HBV RNA was also greatest in the group given NVR 3-778 plus pegIFN (2.09 log 10 copies/mL), compared with the groups given NVR 3-778 or pegIFN alone (1.42 log 10 copies/mL and 0.89 log 10 copies/mL, respectively). There was no significant mean reduction in HBsAg during the 4-week treatment period. There were no discontinuations and no pattern of dose-related adverse effects with NVR 3-778. Conclusions: In a phase 1 study of HBeAg-positive patients with chronic HBV infection without cirrhosis, NVR 3-778 was well tolerated and demonstrated antiviral activity. The agent reduced serum levels of HBV DNA and HBV RNA, to the greatest extent in combination with pegIFN. The observed reductions in HBV RNA confirmed the novel mechanism of NVR 3-778.

Hypermethylation acts to limit immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by inhibiting endogenous interferon responses needed for recognition of cancer cells. By contrast, global hypomethylation results in the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and inhibitory cytokines, accompanied by epithelial-mesenchymal changes that can contribute to immunosuppression. The drivers of these contrasting methylation states are not well understood. DNA methylation also plays a key role in cytotoxic T cell ‘exhaustion’ associated with tumor progression. We present an updated exploratory analysis of how DNA methylation may define patient subgroups and can be targeted to develop tailored treatment combinations to help improve patient outcomes. ? 2019 The Authors",biomarker; DNA methylation; epigenetic remodeling; immune checkpoint blockade; melanoma; PD-L1; PD1; resistance; T cell exhaustion; viral mimicry,DNA; polycomb repressive complex 2; programmed death 1 ligand 1; transcription factor EZH2; cancer resistance; DNA methylation; human; immune response; immunoregulation; immunotherapy; malignant neoplasm; melanoma; melanoma cell; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; Review; T lymphocyte,2-s2.0-85062458972

Additionally, inhibition of potassium current through the cardiac hERG channel by bedaquiline, is associated with prolongation of the QT interval, necessitating cardiovascular monitoring. Analogues were prepared where the naphthalene C-unit was replaced with substituted pyridines to produce compounds with reduced lipophilicity, anticipating a reduction in half-life. While there was a direct correlation between in vitro inhibitory activity against M. tuberculosis (MIC 90 ) and compound lipophilicity, potency only fell off sharply below a clogP of about 4.0, providing a useful lower bound for analogue design. The bulk of the compounds remained potent inhibitors of the hERG potassium channel, with notable exceptions where IC 50 values were at least 5-fold higher than that of bedaquiline. Many of the compounds had desirably higher rates of clearance than bedaquiline, but this was associated with lower plasma exposures in mice, and similar or higher MICs resulted in lower AUC/MIC ratios than bedaquiline for most compounds. The two compounds with lower potency against hERG exhibited similar clearance to bedaquiline and excellent efficacy in vivo, suggesting further exploration of C-ring pyridyls is worthwhile. ? 2019 The Authors",AHYCPVQTWZSXTI-UHFFFAOYSA-N; Bedaquiline; Bedaquiline analogues; BSRVKFLFLKCSCR-UHFFFAOYSA-N; CMBKOLOWRXXJAQ-UHFFFAOYSA-N; Drug development; DVOLLEJITIXUFG-UHFFFAOYSA-N; GDQXVRZSDDBPMP-UHFFFAOYSA-N; GOBWKUISNQAVSD-UHFFFAOYSA-N; HEJXQMJYSQFQOX-UHFFFAOYSA-N; HNLXEIWQRWVUSU-UHFFFAOYSA-N; IAKNWKILKBWHHJ-UHFFFAOYSA-N; JVCNZHZTRWJWNW-UHFFFAOYSA-N; KFLWHJBGGARORU-UHFFFAOYSA-N; LARJMJRNXJABKH-UHFFFAOYSA-N; Lipophilicity; LMUZDMHAKVEGQS-UHFFFAOYSA-N; PASFCMLJOBVMGB-UHFFFAOYSA-N; SXCCYDONNDYDMT-UHFFFAOYSA-N; Tuberculosis; VPFXWXMRHHCWLE-UHFFFAOYSA-N; XGCMXAGODXCXKN-UHFFFAOYSA-N; XYHYFQQKCCCZDE-UHFFFAOYSA-N; YKGQSYUYXSJGSV-UHFFFAOYSA-N; ZCRAGXDCNCYQPH-UHFFFAOYSA-N; ZCVOKXSJKIJDQO-UHFFFAOYSA-N; ZTFCPPTXTSXGHL-UHFFFAOYSA-N,"1 (7 bromo 3 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl) 1 (2,3 dimethoxyphenyl) 4 (dimethylamino) 2 (2,6 dimethylpyridin 4 yl)butan 2 ol; 7 [1 (2,3 dimethoxyphenyl) 4 (dimethylamino) 2 (2,6 dimethylpyridin 4 yl) 2 hydroxybutyl] 6 methoxy 2 naphthonitrile; bedaquiline; bedaquiline derivative; potassium channel HERG; tuberculostatic agent; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; antibacterial activity; area under the curve; Article; chemical modification; controlled study; crystal structure; drug bioavailability; drug clearance; drug efficacy; drug exposure; drug half life; drug potency; drug structure; drug synthesis; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipophilicity; liver microsome; MIC90; mouse; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; physical chemistry; structure activity relation; Vero cell line; volume of distribution",2-s2.0-85061667703

We aimed to appraise the acute effects of single use of HNBC, EVC, and TC in healthy smokers. Methods and Results: This was an independent, cross-over, randomized trial in 20 TC smokers, with allocation to different cycles of HNBC, EVC, and TC. All participants used all types of products, with an intercycle washout of 1?week. End points were oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, platelet activation, flow-mediated dilation, blood pressure, and satisfaction scores. Single use of any product led to an adverse impact on oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, platelet function, flow-mediated dilation, and blood pressure. HNBC had less impact than EVC and TC on soluble Nox2-derived peptide (respectively, P=0.004 and 0.001), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α-III (P=0.004 and &lt;0.001), and vitamin E (P=0.018 and 0.044). HNBC and EVC were equally less impactful than TCs on flow-mediated dilation (P=0.872 for HNBC versus EVC), H2O2 (P=0.522), H2O2 breakdown activity (P=0.091), soluble CD40 ligand (P=0.849), and soluble P-selectin (P=0.821). The effect of HNBC and, to a lesser extent EVC, on blood pressure was less evident than that of TC, whereas HNBC appeared more satisfying than EVC (all P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Acute effects of HNBC, EVC, and TC are different on several oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, platelet function, cardiovascular, and satisfaction dimensions, with TCs showing the most detrimental changes in clinically relevant features.

A male factor is estimated to account for up to half of the infertility cases with between 25% to 87% of male subfertility considered to be due to the effect of oxidative stress. Oral supplementation with antioxidants is thought to improve sperm quality by reducing oxidative damage. Antioxidants are widely available and inexpensive when compared to other fertility treatments, however most antioxidants are uncontrolled by regulation and the evidence for their effectiveness is uncertain. We compared the benefits and risks of different antioxidants used for male subfertility. This review did not examine the use of antioxidants in normospermic men. Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of supplementary oral antioxidants in subfertile men. Search methods: The Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility (CGF) Group trials register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and two trials registers were searched on 1 February 2018, together with reference checking and contact with study authors and experts in the field to identify additional trials. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type, dose or combination of oral antioxidant supplement with placebo, no treatment or treatment with another antioxidant, among subfertile men of a couple attending a reproductive clinic. We excluded studies comparing antioxidants with fertility drugs alone and studies that included fertile men attending a fertility clinic because of female partner infertility. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The primary review outcome was live birth. Clinical pregnancy, adverse events and sperm parameters were secondary outcomes. Main results: We included 61 studies with a total population of 6264 subfertile men, aged between 18 and 65 years, part of a couple who had been referred to a fertility clinic and some of whom were undergoing assisted reproductive techniques (ART). Investigators compared and combined 18 different oral antioxidants. The evidence was of'low' to'very low' quality: the main limitation was that out of the 44 included studies in the meta-analysis only 12 studies reported on live birth or clinical pregnancy. The evidence is current up to February 2018. Live birth: antioxidants may lead to increased live birth rates (OR 1.79, 95% CI 1.20 to 2.67, P = 0.005, 7 RCTs, 750 men, I 2 = 40%, low-quality evidence). Results suggest that if in the studies contributing to the analysis of live birth rate, the baseline chance of live birth following placebo or no treatment is assumed to be 12%, the chance following the use of antioxidants is estimated to be between 14% and 26%. However, this result was based on only 124 live births from 750 couples in seven relatively small studies. When studies at high risk of bias were removed from the analysis, there was no evidence of increased live birth (Peto OR 1.38, 95% CI 0.89 to 2.16; participants = 540 men, 5 RCTs, P = 0.15, I 2 = 0%). Clinical pregnancy rate: antioxidants may lead to increased clinical pregnancy rates (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.91 to 4.63, P &lt; 0.0001, 11 RCTs, 786 men, I 2 = 0%, low-quality evidence) compared to placebo or no treatment. This suggests that if in the studies contributing to the analysis of clinical pregnancy, the baseline chance of clinical pregnancy following placebo or no treatment is assumed to be 7%, the chance following the use of antioxidants is estimated to be between 12% and 26%. This result was based on 105 clinical pregnancies from 786 couples in 11 small studies. Adverse events: Miscarriage: only three studies reported on this outcome and the event rate was very low. There was no difference in miscarriage rate between the antioxidant and placebo or no treatment group (OR 1.74, 95% CI 0.40 to 7.60, P = 0.46, 3 RCTs, 247 men, I 2 = 0%, very low-quality evidence). The findings suggest that in a population of subfertile men with an expected miscarriage rate of 2%, the chance following the use of an antioxidant would result in the risk of a miscarriage between 1% and 13%. Gastrointestinal: antioxidants may lead to an increase in mild gastrointestinal upsets when compared to placebo or no treatment (OR 2.51, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.03, P = 0.010, 11 RCTs, 948 men, I 2 = 50%, very low-quality evidence). This suggests that if the chance of gastrointestinal upsets following placebo or no treatment is assumed to be 2%, the chance following the use of antioxidants is estimated to be between 2% and 9%. However, this result was based on a low event rate of 35 out of 948 men in 10 small or medium-sized studies, and the quality of the evidence was rated very low and was high in heterogeneity. We were unable to draw any conclusions from the antioxidant versus antioxidant comparison as insufficient studies compared the same interventions. Authors' conclusions: In this review, there is low-quality evidence from seven small randomised controlled trials suggesting that antioxidant supplementation in subfertile males may improve live birth rates for couples attending fertility clinics. Low-quality evidence suggests that clinical pregnancy rates may also increase. Overall, there is no evidence of increased risk of miscarriage, however antioxidants may give more mild gastrointestinal upsets but the evidence is of very low quality. Subfertilte couples should be advised that overall, the current evidence is inconclusive based on serious risk of bias due to poor reporting of methods of randomisation, failure to report on the clinical outcomes live birth rate and clinical pregnancy, often unclear or even high attrition, and also imprecision due to often low event rates and small overall sample sizes. Further large well-designed randomised placebo-controlled trials reporting on pregnancy and live births are still required to clarify the exact role of antioxidants. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

factor for adverse cardiovascular health consequences. We analyzed the association of body-fat distribution, assessed by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index, with 228,985 predicted coding and splice site variants available on exome arrays in up to 344,369 individuals from five major ancestries (discovery) and 132,177 European-ancestry individuals (validation). We identified 15 common (minor allele frequency, MAF ?5%) and nine low-frequency or rare (MAF <5%) coding novel variants. Pathway/gene set enrichment analyses identified lipid particle, adiponectin, abnormal white adipose tissue physiology and bone development and morphology as important contributors to fat distribution, while cross-trait associations highlight cardiometabolic traits. In functional follow-up analyses, specifically in Drosophila RNAi-knockdowns, we observed a significant increase in the total body triglyceride levels for two genes (DNAH10 and PLXND1). We implicate novel genes in fat distribution, stressing the importance of interrogating low-frequency and protein-coding variants. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,adiponectin; protein; lipid; protein; ACVR1C gene; adipogenesis; African; angiogenesis; ANGPTL4 gene; Article; bioinformatics; body fat distribution; body mass; bone development; coding; DAGLB gene; DNAH10 gene; Drosophila; East Asian; European; exome; expression quantitative trait locus; FGFR2 gene; gene; gene frequency; gene knockdown; genetic trait; genetic variability; genotype; glucose homeostasis; Hispanic; human; insulin blood level; lipid homeostasis; meta analysis; MLXIPL gene; nonhuman; phenotype; PLXND1 gene; priority journal; RAPGEF3 gene; recessive inheritance; RNA splicing; RREB1 gene; sex difference; South Asian; TBX15 gene; triacylglycerol level; waist hip ratio; white adipose tissue; animal; body fat distribution; case control study; female; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; homeostasis; male; procedures; risk factor; Animals; Body Fat Distribution; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Drosophila; Exome; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Homeostasis; Humans; Lipids; Male; Proteins; Risk Factors; Waist-Hip Ratio,2-s2.0-85061697378

The aim of this project was to develop a consensus statement on the labels and definitions used to describe the basic disease elements of gout. Methods: Experts in gout (n = 130) were invited to participate in a Delphi exercise and face-to-face consensus meeting to reach consensus on the labeling and definitions for the basic disease elements of gout. Disease elements and labels in current use were derived from a content analysis of the contemporary medical literature, and the results of this analysis were used for item selection in the Delphi exercise and face-to-face consensus meeting. Results: There were 51 respondents to the Delphi exercise and 30 attendees at the face-to-face meeting. Consensus agreement (?80%) was achieved for the labels of 8 disease elements through the Delphi exercise; the remaining 3 labels reached consensus agreement through the face-to-face consensus meeting. The agreed labels were monosodium urate crystals, urate, hyperuric(a)emia, tophus, subcutaneous tophus, gout flare, intercritical gout, chronic gouty arthritis, imaging evidence of monosodium urate crystal deposition, gouty bone erosion, and podagra. Participants at the face-to-face meeting achieved consensus agreement for the definitions of all 11 elements and a recommendation that the label “chronic gout” should not be used. Conclusion: Consensus agreement was achieved for the labels and definitions of 11 elements representing the fundamental components of gout etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation. The Gout, Hyperuricemia, and Crystal-Associated Disease Network recommends the use of these labels when describing the basic disease elements of gout. ? 2018, American College of Rheumatology",,urate; uric acid; Article; bone erosion; chronic disease; clinical feature; consensus; content analysis; controlled study; crystal; crystal arthropathy; Delphi study; disease exacerbation; gout; human; hyperuricemia; major clinical study; medical literature; medical terminology; methodology; nomenclature; pathophysiology; pseudogout; tophus; classification; crystal arthropathy; Delphi study; gout; hyperuricemia; Consensus; Crystal Arthropathies; Delphi Technique; Gout; Humans; Hyperuricemia; Uric Acid,2-s2.0-85053427249

Understanding the normal biological functions of calcitonin gene-related peptide is critical to understand the mechanisms of calcitonin gene-related peptide-blocking therapies as well as engineering improvements to these medications. Calcitonin gene-related peptide is closely related to other peptides in the calcitonin gene-related peptide family of peptides, including amylin. Relatedness in peptide sequence and in receptor biology makes it difficult to tease apart the contributions that each peptide and receptor makes to physiological processes and to disorders. Summary: The focus of this review is the expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide, related peptides and their receptors in the central nervous system. Calcitonin gene-related peptide is expressed throughout the nervous system, whereas amylin and adrenomedullin have only limited expression at discrete sites in the brain. The components of two receptors that respond to calcitonin gene-related peptide, the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (calcitonin receptor-like receptor with receptor activity-modifying protein 1) and the AMY 1 receptor (calcitonin receptor with receptor activity-modifying protein 1), are expressed throughout the nervous system. Understanding expression of the peptides and their receptors lays the foundation for more deeply understanding their physiology, pathophysiology and therapeutic use. ?

Furthermore, the effect of coadministration of a tumor-penetrating peptide, internalizing RGD (iRGD), was investigated. First, a bone-targeting moiety, alendronate (ALN), was conjugated with hyaluronic acid (HA), a ligand for CD44. This ALN-HA conjugate was coupled with DSPE-PEG 2000 -COOH through a bioreducible disulfide linker (-SS-) to obtain a functionalized lipid, ALN-HA-SS-L, to be postinserted into preformed liposomes loaded with doxorubicin (DOX). The roles of ALN, HA, and the redox sensitivity of the ALN-HA-SS-L liposomes (ALN-HA-SS-L-L) in the anti-OS effect were critically evaluated against various reference liposomal formulations (with only ALN, HA, or redox sensitivity). ALN-HA-SS-L-L displayed a zeta potential of -26.07 ± 0.32 mV and selectively disassembled in the presence of a reducing agent, 10 mM glutathione, which can be found in cancer cells. Compared to various reference liposomes, ALN-HA-SS-L-L/DOX had significantly higher cytotoxicity to human OS MG-63 cells alongside high and rapid cellular uptake. In the orthotopic OS nude mouse models, ALN-HA-SS-L-L/DOX showed remarkable tumor growth suppression and prolonged survival time. This result was further improved by the coadministration of iRGD. The antitumor effects of various liposomes were ranked in the same order as the degree of tumor biodistribution shown by in vivo/ex vivo imaging: ALN-HA-SS-L-L coadministered with iRGD &gt; ALN-HA-SS-L-L &gt; HA-SS-L-L &gt; HA-L-L &gt; PEG-L&gt; free drug. ALN-HA-SS-L-L/DOX also reduced the cardiotoxicity of DOX and lung metastases. Overall, this study demonstrated that ALN-HA-SS-L-L/DOX, equipped with bone- and CD44-dual-targeting abilities and redox sensitivity, could be a promising OS-targeted therapy. The efficacy could also be augmented by coadministration of iRGD. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.",alendronate (ALN); hyaluronic acid (HA); hydroxyapatite; iRGD; osteosarcoma (OS); redox-sensitive liposomes,"Bone; Hydroxyapatite; Liposomes; Organic acids; Peptides; Sulfur compounds; Targeted drug delivery; Tumors; Antitumor effect; Biodistributions; Functionalized lipids; iRGD; Liposomal formulation; Osteosarcoma; Redox sensitives; Tumor-penetrating peptides; Hyaluronic acid; alendronic acid; Cd44 protein, mouse; hyaluronic acid binding protein; liposome; tumor protein; animal; Bagg albino mouse; bone tumor; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug screening; female; human; metabolism; nude mouse; osteosarcoma; pathology; tumor cell line; Alendronate; Animals; Bone Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Female; Humans; Hyaluronan Receptors; Liposomes; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Proteins; Osteosarcoma; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85061490929

This inhibitor specifically targets the P-loop of the FGFR tyrosine kinase domain, forming a covalent adduct with a cysteine side chain of the protein. Our mass spectrometry experiments characterise an exceptionally fast chemical reaction in forming the covalent complex. The structural basis of this reactivity is revealed by a sequence of three X-ray crystal structures: a free ligand structure, a reversible FGFR1 structure, and the first reported irreversible FGFR1 adduct structure. We hypothesise that the most significant reactivity feature of TAS-120 is its inherent ability to undertake conformational sampling of the FGFR P-loop. In designing novel covalent FGFR inhibitors, such a phenomenon presents an attractive strategy requiring appropriate positioning of an acrylamide group similarly to that of TAS-120. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Herein, a novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was developed for 5hmC detection based on WS 2 nanosheets as the photoactive material and boronic acid functionalized carbon dots (B-CDs) for signal amplification unit. This biosensor can also be used for T4-β-glucosyltransferase (β-GT) activity assessment. Firstly, WS 2 nanosheets and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were immobilized on an ITO electrode surface. Then probe DNA was immobilized on this electrode surface via Au-S bond. Afterwards, the complementary DNA containing 5hmC was then captured on the modified electrode surface by hybridization. Subsequently, β-GT transferred glucose from uridine diphosphoglucose to the hydroxyl groups of the 5hmC residues. After glycosylation, B-CDs could further be immobilized on the modified electrode surface resulting in a strong photocurrent. The PEC biosensor afforded high selectivity, excellent sensitivity and good reproducibility, with detection limits of 0.0034 nM and 0.028 unit/mL for 5hmC and β-GT, respectively. Results demonstrate that the photoelectrochemical strategy introduced here based on WS 2 nanosheets and B-CDs offers a versatile platform for hydroxymethylated DNA detection, β-GT activity assessment and β-GT inhibitor screening. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Carbon dots; DNA hydroxymethylation; Photoelectrochemical biosensor; WS 2 nanosheets; β-Glucosyltransferase,Bioassay; Biosensors; Carbon; DNA; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Gold nanoparticles; Mammals; Nanosheets; Photoelectrochemical cells; Tungsten compounds; 5-hydroxymethylcytosine; Carbon dots; Glucosyltransferases; Hydroxymethylation; Modified electrode surfaces; Photoactive materials; Photoelectrochemicals; Signal amplifications; Gold compounds; carbon dot; complementary DNA; glucosyltransferase; gold nanoparticle; hydroxyl group; nanoparticle; nanosheet; t4 beta glucosyltransferase; unclassified drug; uridine diphosphate glucose; WS2 nanosheet; cadmium derivative; carbon; DNA; enzyme inhibitor; glucosyltransferase; gold; metal nanoparticle; Article; chemical bond; chemical phenomena; chemical structure; controlled study; DNA hydroxymethylation; DNA methylation; DNA probe; electron transport; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; genetic screening; glycosylation; hybridization; limit of detection; photoelectrochemical biosensor; Raman spectrometry; reproducibility; selectivity; sensitivity analysis; transmission electron microscopy; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; DNA methylation; electrochemical analysis; electrode; genetic procedures; genetics; human; isolation and purification; nucleic acid hybridization; Biosensing Techniques; Cadmium Compounds; Carbon; DNA; DNA Methylation; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Enzyme Inhibitors; Glucosyltransferases; Gold; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Nucleic Acid Hybridization,2-s2.0-85058941879

algorithm for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk estimation. We conducted head-to-head comparisons of four algorithms recommended by primary prevention guidelines, before and after 'recalibration', a method that adapts risk algorithms to take account of differences in the risk characteristics of the populations being studied. Methods and results Using individual-participant data on 360 737 participants without CVD at baseline in 86 prospective studies from 22 countries, we compared the Framingham risk score (FRS), Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE), pooled cohort equations (PCE), and Reynolds risk score (RRS). We calculated measures of risk discrimination and calibration, and modelled clinical implications of initiating statin therapy in people judged to be at 'high' 10 year CVD risk. Original risk algorithms were recalibrated using the risk factor profile and CVD incidence of target populations. The four algorithms had similar risk discrimination. Before recalibration, FRS, SCORE, and PCE over-predicted CVD risk on average by 10%, 52%, and 41%, respectively, whereas RRS under-predicted by 10%. Original versions of algorithms classified 29-39% of individuals aged ?40 years as high risk. By contrast, recalibration reduced this proportion to 22-24% for every algorithm. We estimated that to prevent one CVD event, it would be necessary to initiate statin therapy in 44-51 such individuals using original algorithms, in contrast to 37-39 individuals with recalibrated algorithms. Conclusion Before recalibration, the clinical performance of four widely used CVD risk algorithms varied substantially. By contrast, simple recalibration nearly equalized their performance and improved modelled targeting of preventive action to clinical need. ? 2018 The Author(s).

Objective: To systematically assess the association between neonatal hypoglycaemia on neurodevelopment outcomes in childhood and adolescence. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from inception until February 2018. We included studies that reported one or more prespecified outcomes and compared children exposed to neonatal hypoglycaemia with children not exposed. Studies of neonates with congenital malformations, inherited metabolic disorders and congenital hyperinsulinism were excluded. Two authors independently extracted data using a customized form. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias, GRADE for quality of evidence, and REVMAN for meta-analysis (inverse variance, fixed effects). Results: 1,665 studies were screened, 61 reviewed in full, and 11 included (12 publications). In early childhood, exposure to neonatal hypoglycaemia was not associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (n = 1,657 infants; OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.86-1.57) but was associated with visual-motor impairment (n = 508; OR = 3.46, 95% CI = 1.13-10.57) and executive dysfunction (n = 463; OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.20-5.22). In mid-childhood, neonatal hypoglycaemia was associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (n = 54; OR = 3.62, 95% CI = 1.05-12.42) and low literacy (n = 1,395; OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.20-3.47) and numeracy (n = 1,395; OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.21-3.44). No data were available for adolescents. Conclusions: Neonatal hypoglycaemia may have important long-lasting adverse effects on neurodevelopment that may become apparent at later ages. Carefully designed randomized trials are required to determine the optimal management of neonates at risk of hypoglycaemia with long-term follow-up at least to school age. ? 2018 S.

We aimed to analyse comprehensively body composition and insulin traits as biomarkers of IFD in healthy normoglycaemic individuals as well as in individuals with new-onset prediabetes or diabetes after acute pancreatitis (NODAP). A total of 29 healthy individuals and 34 individuals with NODAP took part in this cross-sectional study. The studied biomarkers belonged to the following domains: body composition (anthropometric and MRI-derived variables); indices of insulin secretion; indices of insulin sensitivity; incretins and related peptides; and pancreatitis-related factors. All MRI-derived variables (including IFD) were measured using ImageJ software. Univariate and step-wise regression analyses were conducted to determine variables that best explained variance in IFD. Visceral fat volume and oxyntomodulin were the best biomarkers of IFD in normoglycaemic healthy individuals, contributing to 64% variance. The Raynaud index was the best biomarker of IFD in individuals with NODAP, contributing to 20% variance. Longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate the cause and effect relationship between oxyntomodulin and IFD in healthy individuals, as well as insulin sensitivity and IFD in individuals with NODAP. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",acute pancreatitis; body composition; diabetes; insulin sensitivity; intra-pancreatic fat; oxyntomodulin,biological marker; incretin; insulin; oxyntomodulin; acute pancreatitis; adult; anthropometry; Article; body composition; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; female; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin release; insulin sensitivity; intra-abdominal fat; intrapancreatic fat deposition; lipid storage; longitudinal study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pancreas; prospective study; acute disease; body composition; complication; diabetes mellitus; diabetic complication; diagnostic imaging; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; metabolism; normal human; obesity; onset age; pancreas; pancreatitis; pathology; physiology; Acute Disease; Adiposity; Adult; Age of Onset; Body Composition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Lipid Metabolism; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Pancreas; Pancreatitis; Prediabetic State,2-s2.0-85053932415

Current treatments for AF remain suboptimal due to a lack of understanding of the underlying atrial structures that directly sustain AF. Existing approaches for analyzing atrial structures in 3-D, especially from late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging, rely heavily on manual segmentation methods that are extremely labor-intensive and prone to errors. As a result, a robust and automated method for analyzing atrial structures in 3-D is of high interest. We have, therefore, developed AtriaNet, a 16-layer convolutional neural network (CNN), on 154 3-D LGE-MRIs with a spatial resolution of 0.625 mm × 0.625 mm × 1.25 mm from patients with AF, to automatically segment the left atrial (LA) epicardium and endocardium. AtriaNet consists of a multi-scaled, dual-pathway architecture that captures both the local atrial tissue geometry and the global positional information of LA using 13 successive convolutions and three further convolutions for merging. By utilizing computationally efficient batch prediction, AtriaNet was able to successfully process each 3-D LGE-MRI within 1 min. Furthermore, benchmarking experiments have shown that AtriaNet has outperformed the state-of-the-art CNNs, with a DICE score of 0.940 and 0.942 for the LA epicardium and endocardium, respectively, and an inter-patient variance of &lt;0.001. The estimated LA diameter and volume computed from the automatic segmentations were accurate to within 1.59 mm and 4.01 cm 3 of the ground truths. Our proposed CNN was tested on the largest known data set for LA segmentation, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the most robust approach that has ever been developed for segmenting LGE-MRIs.

The lead proligands and Cu(II) complexes displayed higher antiproliferative activity in cancer cells than triapine. In addition, complexes 2-5 were found to specifically inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus with MIC 50 values at 2-5 μg/mL.

This retrospective cohort study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the New Zealand meningococcal B vaccine against gonorrhea-associated hospitalization. The cohort consisted of individuals born from 1984 to 1999 residing in New Zealand. Therefore, it was eligible for meningococcal B vaccination from 2004 to 2008. Administrative datasets of demographics, customs, hospitalization, education, income tax, and immunization were linked using the national Integrated Data Infrastructure. The primary outcome was hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of gonorrhea. Cox’s proportional hazards models were applied with a Firth correction for rare outcomes to generate estimates of hazard ratios. Vaccine effectiveness estimates were calculated as 1-Hazard Ratio expressed as a percentage. There were 1,143,897 eligible cohort members with 135 missing information on gender, 16,245 missing ethnicity, and 197,502 missing deprivation. Therefore, only 935,496 cohort members were included in the analysis. After adjustment for gender, ethnicity, and deprivation, vaccine effectiveness (MeNZB?) against hospitalization caused by gonorrhea was estimated to be 24% (95% CI 1–42%). In conclusion, the data suggests vaccination with MeNZB? significantly reduced the rate of hospitalization from gonorrhea. This supports prior research indicating possible cross protection of this vaccine against gonorrhea acquisition and disease in the outpatient setting. ? 2019 by the authors.

Design Individual participant data meta-analysis. Setting Cohorts from 40 countries with data collected between 1970 and 2017. Participants Adults in 39 general population cohorts (n=5 459 014), of which 21 (n=594 496) had data on waist circumference; six cohorts with high cardiovascular risk (n=84 417); and 18 cohorts with chronic kidney disease (n=91 607). Main outcome measures GFR decline (estimated GFR decline ?40%, initiation of kidney replacement therapy or estimated GFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and all cause mortality. Results Over a mean follow-up of eight years, 246 607 (5.6%) individuals in the general population cohorts had GFR decline (18 118 (0.4%) end stage kidney disease events) and 782 329 (14.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, race, and current smoking, the hazard ratios for GFR decline comparing body mass indices 30, 35, and 40 with body mass index 25 were 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.27), 1.69 (1.51 to 1.89), and 2.02 (1.80 to 2.27), respectively. Results were similar in all subgroups of estimated GFR. Associations weakened after adjustment for additional comorbidities, with respective hazard ratios of 1.03 (0.95 to 1.11), 1.28 (1.14 to 1.44), and 1.46 (1.28 to 1.67). The association between body mass index and death was J shaped, with the lowest risk at body mass index of 25. In the cohorts with high cardiovascular risk and chronic kidney disease (mean follow-up of six and four years, respectively), risk associations between higher body mass index and GFR decline were weaker than in the general population, and the association between body mass index and death was also J shaped, with the lowest risk between body mass index 25 and 30. In all cohort types, associations between higher waist circumference and higher waist-to-height ratio with GFR decline were similar to that of body mass index; however, increased risk of death was not associated with lower waist circumference or waist-to-height ratio, as was seen with body mass index. Conclusions Elevated body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio are independent risk factors for GFR decline and death in individuals who have normal or reduced levels of estimated GFR. ?

Long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) are the most commonly identified with genetic testing. The cellular action potential driving the heart cycle is shaped by a specific series of depolarising and repolarising ion currents mediated by ion channels. Alterations in any of these currents, and in the availability of intracellular free calcium, leaves the myocardium vulnerable to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Each channelopathy has its own electrocardiogram (ECG) signature, typical mode of presentation, and most commonly related gene. Long QT type 1 (gene, KCNQ1) and CPVT (gene, RyR2) typically present with cardiac events (ie syncope or cardiac arrest) during or immediately after exercise in young males; long QT type 2 (gene, KCNH2) after startle or during the night in adult females-particularly early post-partum, and long QT type 3 and Brugada syndrome (gene, SCN5A) during the night in young adult males. They are commonly misdiagnosed as seizure disorders. Fever-triggered cardiac events should also raise the suspicion of BrS. This review summarises genetics, cellular mechanisms, risk stratification and treatments. Beta blockers are the mainstay of treatment for long QT syndrome and CPVT, and flecainide is remarkably effective in CPVT. Brugada syndrome is genetically a more complex disease than the others, and risk stratification and management is more difficult. ? 2018",Brugada syndrome; Channelopathy; CPVT; Genetics; Long QT syndrome; Sudden death,"potassium channel KCNQ1; ryanodine receptor 2; sodium channel Nav1.5; arrhythmogenesis; Brugada syndrome; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; disease association; early repolarization syndrome; electrocardiography; electrophysiology; gene; gene expression; genotype phenotype correlation; heart cycle; heart muscle conduction disturbance; heart muscle excitability; heart muscle potential; heart ventricle fibrillation; human; KCNH2 gene; KCNQ1 gene; long QT syndrome 1; long QT syndrome 2; long QT syndrome 3; long QT syndrome 5; missense mutation; modifier gene; pathophysiology; prevalence; priority journal; QRS complex; QT interval; Review; RyR2 gene; SCN5A gene; ST segment depression; sudden cardiac death; T wave; channelopathy; complication; genetic screening; genetics; procedures; sudden cardiac death; Channelopathies; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Genetic Testing; Humans",2-s2.0-85055723321

Methods We conducted an individual participant data meta-Analysis of three randomised clinical trials that compared a strategy using a polypill containing aspirin, statin and antihypertensive therapy with usual care in patients with a prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) event or who were at high risk of their first event. Overall, the trials included 3140 patients from Australia, England, India, Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand (75% male, mean age 62 years and 76% with a prior CVD event). The primary outcome for this study was the proportion of people achieving ESC guideline targets for BP, LDL and antiplatelet therapy. Results Those randomised to polypill-based care were more likely than those receiving usual care to achieve recommended targets for BP (62% vs 58%, risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15), LDL (39% vs 34%, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25) and all three targets for BP, LDL and adherence to antiplatelet therapy (the latter only applicable to those with a prior CVD event) simultaneously (24% vs 19%, RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.47) at 12 months. There was no difference between groups in antiplatelet adherence (96% vs 96%, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01). There was heterogeneity by baseline treatment intensity such that treatment effects increased with the fewer the number of treatments being taken at baseline: for patients taking 3, 2 and 0-1 treatment modalities the RRs for reaching all three guideline goals simultaneously were 1.10 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.30, 22% vs 20%), 1.62 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.42, 27% vs 17%) and 3.07 (95% CI 1.77 to 5.33, 35% vs 11%), respectively. Conclusions Polypill-based therapy significantly improved the achievement of all three ESC targets for BP, LDL and antiplatelet therapy compared with usual care, particularly among those undertreated at baseline. ? ?

We sought to evaluate the international epidemiological differences in acute poisonings in children presenting to emergency departments (EDs) from 8 different global regions. Methods: This was an international multicenter cross-sectional prospective study including children younger than 18 years with acute poisonings presenting to 105 EDs in 20 countries was conducted. Data collection started at each ED between January and September 2013, and continued for 1 year. Results: During the study period, we registered 363,245 pediatric ED presentations, of which 1727 were for poisoning (0.47%; 95% confidence interval, 0.45%-0.50%), with a significant variation in incidence between the regions. Full data were obtained for 1688 presentations. Most poisonings (1361 [80.6%]) occurred at home with either ingestion (1504 [89.0%]) or inhalation of the toxin (126 [7.6%]). Nonintentional exposures accounted for 1157 poisonings (68.5%; mainly in South America and Eastern Mediterranean region), with therapeutic drugs (494 [42.7%]), household products (310 [26.8%]), and pesticides (59 [5.1%]) being the most common toxins. Suicide attempts accounted for 233 exposures (13.8%; mainly in the Western Pacific region and North America), with therapeutic drugs (214 [91.8%], mainly psychotropics and acetaminophen) being the most common toxins. Significant differences between regions were found in both types of poisonings. Recreational poisonings were more common in Europe and Western Pacific region. No patient died. Conclusions: There are substantial epidemiological differences in acute poisonings among children in different countries and regions of the globe. International best practices need to be identified for prevention of acute poisonings in childhood. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Sleep deprivation is associated with impaired neurocognitive function and emotional control, and increases the risk for cardiometabolic diseases, obesity and cancer. Sleep develops during fetal life with the emergence of a recognisable pattern of sleep states in the preterm fetus associated with the development, maturation and connectivity within neural networks in the brain. Despite the physiological importance of sleep, surprisingly little is known about how sleep develops in individuals born preterm. Globally, an estimated 15 million babies are born preterm (<37?weeks gestation) each year, and these babies are at significant risk of neural injury and impaired brain development. This review discusses how sleep develops during fetal and neonatal life, how preterm birth impacts on sleep development to adulthood, and the factors which may contribute to impaired brain and sleep development, leading to altered neurocognitive, behavioural and motor capabilities in the infant and child. Going forward, the challenge is to identify specific risk factors for impaired sleep development in preterm babies to allow for the design of interventions that will improve the quality and quantity of sleep throughout life.

However, the effects of reducing gluten-rich food items including wheat, barley and rye cereals in healthy adults are unclear. Here, we undertook a randomised, controlled, cross-over trial involving 60 middle-aged Danish adults without known disorders with two 8-week interventions comparing a low-gluten diet (2 g gluten per day) and a high-gluten diet (18 g gluten per day), separated by a washout period of at least six weeks with habitual diet (12 g gluten per day). We find that, in comparison with a high-gluten diet, a low-gluten diet induces moderate changes in the intestinal microbiome, reduces fasting and postprandial hydrogen exhalation, and leads to improvements in self-reported bloating. These observations suggest that most of the effects of a low-gluten diet in non-coeliac adults may be driven by qualitative changes in dietary fibres. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"acid; arabinose; carbon dioxide; fatty acid; formic acid; fructose oligosaccharide; galactose; galacturonic acid; glutamic acid; gluten; hydrogen; inflammasome; interleukin 1beta; kynurenine; lactose; lignan; manganese; mannitol; mannose; methane; peptide YY; rhamnose; sorbitol; sulfate; tryptophan; xylose; zinc; bacterial DNA; creatinine; cytokine; gluten; adult; diet; digestive system; fasting; hydrogen; induced response; protein; qualitative analysis; adult; aged; Anaeostipes hadrus; Article; barley; Blautia; Blautia wexlerae; bloating; carbohydrate analysis; carbohydrate metabolism; Clostridiales; comparative study; controlled study; crossover procedure; cytokine release; Danish citizen; diet therapy; Dorea longicatena; double blind procedure; drug megadose; Eubacterium; Eubacterium hallii; ex vivo study; exhalation; fasting; fermentation; high gluten diet; human; intestine flora; Lachnospiraceae; low drug dose; low gluten diet; mass fragmentography; metabolome; metabolomics; methanogenesis; microbiome; normal human; polymerase chain reaction; postprandial state; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial; rye; self report; test meal; ultra performance liquid chromatography; wheat; whole genome sequencing; blood; body mass; Denmark; diet; diet restriction; feces; female; genetics; intestine; male; metagenomics; microbiology; middle aged; urine; young adult; Hordeum; Secale cereale; Triticum aestivum; Adult; Aged; Body Mass Index; Creatinine; Cross-Over Studies; Cytokines; Denmark; Diet; DNA, Bacterial; Fasting; Feces; Female; Fermentation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Glutens; Humans; Hydrogen; Intestines; Male; Metabolomics; Metagenomics; Middle Aged; Postprandial Period; Self Report; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85056452791

The original aMRI approach used a video-processing algorithm, Eulerian video magnification (EVM), to amplify cardio-ballistic motion in retrospectively cardiac-gated MRI data. Here, we strive to improve aMRI by incorporating a phase-based motion amplification algorithm. Methods: Phase-based aMRI was developed and tested for correct implementation and ability to amplify sub-voxel motions using digital phantom simulations. The image quality of phase-based aMRI was compared with EVM-based aMRI in healthy volunteers at 3T, and its amplified motion characteristics were compared with phase-contrast MRI. Data were also acquired on a patient with Chiari I malformation, and qualitative displacement maps were produced using free form deformation (FFD) of the aMRI output. Results: Phantom simulations showed that phase-based aMRI has a linear dependence of amplified displacement on true displacement. Amplification was independent of temporal frequency, varying phantom intensity, Rician noise, and partial volume effect. Phase-based aMRI supported larger amplification factors than EVM-based aMRI and was less sensitive to noise and artifacts. Abnormal biomechanics were seen on FFD maps of the Chiari I malformation patient. Conclusion: Phase-based aMRI might be used in the future for quantitative analysis of minute changes in brain motion and may reveal subtle physiological variations of the brain as a result of pathology using processing of the fundamental harmonic or by selectively varying temporal harmonics. Preliminary data shows the potential of phase-based aMRI to qualitatively assess abnormal biomechanics in Chiari I malformation. ? 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",amplified MRI; balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP); cardiac-gated; Chiari I malformation; free-form deformation; phase contrast MRI; phase-based video motion processing,"adult; algorithm; anterior cingulate; Arnold Chiari malformation; Article; basal cistern; basilar artery; biomechanics; brain artery; brain region; brain stem; brain tissue; cerebellum; controlled study; corpus callosum; frontal lobe; heart rate; human; image analysis; image quality; male; mesencephalon; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; signal noise ratio; simulation; spinal cord; brain; cerebellar ataxia; computer assisted diagnosis; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; female; foramen magnum; image processing; imaging phantom; movement (physiology); normal human; preschool child; procedures; videorecording; Adult; Algorithms; Arnold-Chiari Malformation; Brain; Cerebellar Ataxia; Child, Preschool; Computer Simulation; Female; Foramen Magnum; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Movement; Phantoms, Imaging; Video Recording",2-s2.0-85055687005

This study examined the association between exposure to fine particles (PM2.5) and the prevalence of diabetes among Chinese elderly people. We surveyed 11,504 adults aged ?50 years in China, estimated the annual concentrations of ambient PM2.5 using a satellite-based model of aerosol optical depth information. We employed a generalized mixed effects model to examine the association between PM2.5 and the prevalence of diabetes and explored potential effect modifiers. We estimated diabetes burden attributable to ambient PM2.5 if the observed association is indeed causal. The diabetes prevalence among the participants was 6.5% (n = 745). Our analysis found a statistically significant association between PM2.5 and diabetes. The adjusted odds ratio was 1.27 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.12, 1.43) for each 10 μg/m3 increment in ambient PM2.5. Stratified analyses found a lower association among the participants with higher consumption of fruit. We estimated that 22.02% (95% CI: 8.59%, 43.29%) of the diabetes cases could be ascribable to ambient PM2.5. Our finding suggests that PM2.5 exposures could increase the risk of diabetes, and if causal, could be responsible for substantial burden of diabetes among the Chinese elderly; and higher intakes of fruit might reduce the harmful effects of PM2.5, however, due to the limitation of the cross-sectional study design, more studies are warranted to confirm this observation.

Data Sources: A literature search was undertaken of health and medical electronic databases (PubMED, Medline, CINAHL, Embase, PEDRO, Web of Science, Scopus) until March 1, 2017. Study Selection: Studies were included if they were published in the English language and met the following criteria: structured exercise as the primary intervention, ?80% study participants diagnosed with advanced cancer that is unlikely to be cured; reported outcomes concerning physical function, quality of life, fatigue, body composition, psychosocial function, sleep quality pain, and/or survival. Data Extraction: After title and abstract screening, 68 articles were eligible for full-text review, with a total of 25 studies (n=1188; 16 controlled trials, 9 noncontrolled trials) included in the quantitative synthesis. Two reviewers assessed methodological quality using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool for controlled trials and a modified Newcastle–Ottawa Scale for noncontrolled trials. Data Synthesis: Aerobic exercise was used in 6 studies, resistance training in 3 studies, and combination training (aerobic and resistance) in 15 studies. Significant between- and within-group improvements were reported with exercise in ?50% of studies assessing physical function (83%), quality of life (55%), fatigue (50%), body composition (56%), psychosocial function (56%), and sleep quality (100%). Improvement within or between groups in pain after exercise was only observed in 2 studies (25%), whereas survival was unaffected in any study. Conclusions: Most studies reported significant between- and/or within-group improvements in physical function, quality of life, fatigue, body composition, psychosocial function, and sleep quality in patients with advanced cancer, although the effects on pain and survival rates are unclear.

Recent increases in prescribing can be explained more by repeat prescriptions than new patients. This raises the question of whether antidepressants are addictive. A total of 1829 New Zealanders who had been prescribed antidepressants completed an online survey; 44% had been taking antidepressants for more than 3?years and were still taking them. Withdrawal effects when stopping medication were reported by 55%, and addiction by 27%. Paroxetine had particularly high rates of withdrawal symptoms. Only 1% of participants recalled being told about withdrawal effects when prescribed the drugs. Such high rates of withdrawal symptoms suggest that all concerned, including mental health nurses, need to help people considering antidepressants to understand that it can be difficult to withdraw from them. It will also be beneficial to closely monitor people already taking antidepressants and who are at risk of long-term usage. ? 2018 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.",addiction; antidepressants; depression; discontinuation syndrome; withdrawal effects,antidepressant agent; adolescent; adult; drug dependence; female; human; male; middle aged; New Zealand; risk factor; withdrawal syndrome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Antidepressive Agents; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Risk Factors; Substance Withdrawal Syndrome; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85052481339

We hypothesized that the initial, fixed low-energy diet (LED) would induce different metabolic outcomes in men vs women. Materials and methods: All participants followed a LED (3.4 MJ/810 kcal/daily) for 8 weeks (Cambridge Weight Plan). Participants were recruited from 8 sites in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Those eligible for inclusion were overweight (BMI ? 25 kg/m2) individuals with pre-diabetes according to ADA-criteria. Outcomes of interest included changes in insulin resistance, fat mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM) and metabolic syndrome Z-score. Results: In total, 2224 individuals (1504 women, 720 men) attended the baseline visit and 2020 (90.8%) completed the follow-up visit. Following the LED, weight loss was 16% greater in men than in women (11.8% vs 10.3%, respectively) but improvements in insulin resistance were similar. HOMA-IR decreased by 1.50 ± 0.15 in men and by 1.35 ± 0.15 in women (ns). After adjusting for differences in weight loss, men had larger reductions in metabolic syndrome Z-score, C-peptide, FM and heart rate, while women had larger reductions in HDL cholesterol, FFM, hip circumference and pulse pressure. Following the LED, 35% of participants of both genders had reverted to normo-glycaemia. Conclusions: An 8-week LED induced different effects in women than in men. These findings are clinically important and suggest gender-specific changes after weight loss. It is important to investigate whether the greater decreases in FFM, hip circumference and HDL cholesterol in women after rapid weight loss compromise weight loss maintenance and future cardiovascular health. ? 2018 The Authors.

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The majority of disease associations are known to be driven by regulatory variants. To identify the putative causative genes that are perturbed by these variants, we generate a large transcriptome data set (nine disease-relevant cell types) and identify 23,650 cis-eQTL. We show that these are determined by ?9720 regulatory modules, of which ?3000 operate in multiple tissues and ?970 on multiple genes. We identify regulatory modules that drive the disease association for 63 of the 200 risk loci, and show that these are enriched in multigenic modules. Based on these analyses, we resequence 45 of the corresponding 100 candidate genes in 6600 Crohn disease (CD) cases and 5500 controls, and show with burden tests that they include likely causative genes.

We tested the hypothesis that hair segments could be used to reflect a metabolite profile containing information from both endogenous and exogenous compounds accumulated during the nine months of pregnancy. Segments of hair samples corresponding to the trimesters were collected from 175 pregnant women in New Zealand. The hair samples were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. In healthy pregnancies, 56 hair metabolites were significantly different between the first and second trimesters, while 62 metabolites were different between the first and third trimesters (p < 0.05). Additionally, three metabolites in the second trimester hair samples were significantly different between healthy controls and women who delivered small-for-gestational-Age infants (p < 0.05), and ten metabolites in third trimester hair were significantly different between healthy controls and women with gestational diabetes mellitus (p < 0.01). The findings from this pilot study provide improved insight into the changes of the hair metabolome during pregnancy, as well as highlight the potential of the maternal hair metabolome to differentiate pregnancy complications from healthy pregnancies. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,biological marker; female; hair; human; metabolism; metabolome; metabolomics; New Zealand; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; procedures; Biomarkers; Female; Hair; Humans; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Metabolome; Metabolomics; New Zealand; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Trimesters,2-s2.0-85042792899

Quantitative analysis of PVS on Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) is important for understanding their relationship with neurological diseases. In this work, we propose a segmentation technique based on the 3D Frangi filtering for extraction of PVS from MRI. We used ordered logit models and visual rating scales as alternative ground truth for Frangi filter parameter optimization and evaluation. We optimized and validated our proposed models on two independent cohorts, a dementia sample (N = 20) and patients who previously had mild to moderate stroke (N = 48).

To investigate the role of IL-6 we crossed Δ122p53 mice with IL-6 null mice. Here we show that loss of IL-6 reduced JAK-STAT signalling, tumour incidence and metastasis. We also show that Δ122p53 activates RhoA-ROCK signalling leading to tumour cell invasion, which is IL-6-dependent and can be reduced by inhibition of JAK-STAT and RhoA-ROCK pathways. Similarly, we show that Δ133p53 activates these pathways, resulting in invasive and migratory phenotypes in colorectal cancer cells. Gene expression analysis of colorectal tumours showed enrichment of GPCR signalling associated with Δ133TP53 mRNA. Patients with elevated Δ133TP53 mRNA levels had a shorter disease-free survival. Our results suggest that Δ133p53 promotes tumour invasion by activation of the JAK-STAT and RhoA-ROCK pathways, and that patients whose tumours have high Δ133TP53 may benefit from therapies targeting these pathways. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"4 (1 aminoethyl) n (4 pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide; G protein coupled receptor; interleukin 6; Janus kinase; Janus kinase inhibitor; messenger RNA; Rho kinase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; STAT protein; interleukin 6; isoprotein; Janus kinase; messenger RNA; protein p53; Rho kinase; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; STAT protein; TP53 protein, human; Trp53 protein, mouse; cancer; cell; gene expression; inhibition; survival; tumor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer incidence; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell invasion; cell migration; colorectal cancer cell line; colorectal tumor; controlled study; disease association; disease free survival; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; gene expression; genetic association; human; human tissue; JAK-STAT signaling; metastasis; mouse; nonhuman; phenotypic variation; protein targeting; signal transduction; tumor cell; tumor invasion; animal; colorectal tumor; female; HCT 116 cell line; male; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; prognosis; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Mus; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Disease-Free Survival; Female; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Interleukin-6; Janus Kinases; Male; Mice; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Prognosis; Protein Isoforms; rho-Associated Kinases; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction; STAT Transcription Factors; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",2-s2.0-85041397240

We aim to identify potential loci associated with SCA and to identify risk factors causally associated with SCA. Methods and results We carried out a large genome-wide association study (GWAS) for SCA (n = 3939 cases, 25 989 non-cases) to examine common variation genome-wide and in candidate arrhythmia genes. We also exploited Mendelian randomization (MR) methods using cross-trait multi-variant genetic risk score associations (GRSA) to assess causal relationships of 18 risk factors with SCA. No variants were associated with SCA at genome-wide significance, nor were common variants in candidate arrhythmia genes associated with SCA at nominal significance. Using cross-trait GRSA, we established genetic correlation between SCA and (i) coronary artery disease (CAD) and traditional CAD risk factors (blood pressure, lipids, and diabetes), (ii) height and BMI, and (iii) electrical instability traits (QT and atrial fibrillation), suggesting aetiologic roles for these traits in SCA risk. Conclusions Our findings show that a comprehensive approach to the genetic architecture of SCA can shed light on the determinants of a complex life-threatening condition with multiple influencing factors in the general population. The results of this genetic analysis, both positive and negative findings, have implications for evaluating the genetic architecture of patients with a family history of SCA, and for efforts to prevent SCA in high-risk populations and the general community. ? 2018 Oxford University Press.",Genome-wide association study; Mendelian randomization; Sudden cardiac arrest,"aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; blood pressure; body height; body mass; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; coronary artery disease; correlational study; diabetes mellitus; disease association; disease control; family history; female; gene locus; gene structure; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic risk score association; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; high risk population; human; life threat; lipid analysis; major clinical study; male; observational study; priority journal; scoring system; sudden cardiac death; genetics; heart arrhythmia; heart muscle conduction system; Mendelian randomization analysis; meta analysis; pathophysiology; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; sex factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; sudden cardiac death; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Body Mass Index; Coronary Artery Disease; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heart Conduction System; Humans; Male; Mendelian Randomization Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sex Factors",2-s2.0-85056802981

The aim of this article was to present, describe, and compare the findings from these Report Cards. Methods: The Report Cards were developed using a harmonized process for data gathering, assessing, and assigning grades to 10 common physical activity indicators. Descriptive statistics were calculated after converting letter grades to interval variables, and correlational analyses between the 10 common indicators were performed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. Results: A matrix of 300 grades was obtained with substantial variations within and between countries. Low grades were observed for behavioral indicators, and higher grades were observed for sources of influence indicators, indicating a disconnect between supports and desired behaviors. Conclusion: This analysis summarizes the level and context of the physical activity of children and youth among very high Human Development Index countries, and provides additional evidence that the situation regarding physical activity in children and youth is very concerning. Unless a major shift to a more active lifestyle happens soon, a high rate of noncommunicable diseases can be anticipated when this generation of children reaches adulthood. ? 2018 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Children physical activity; Global matrix; International comparison; Sedentary behavior,"adolescent; child; clinical trial; exercise; female; health care policy; health promotion; human; male; multicenter study; preschool child; procedures; psychology; research; trends; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Exercise; Female; Health Policy; Health Promotion; Humans; Male; Research Report",2-s2.0-85057089608

CACNA1E is highly expressed in the central nervous system and encodes the α1-subunit of the voltage-gated CaV2.3 channel, which conducts high voltage-activated R-type calcium currents that initiate synaptic transmission. Using next-generation sequencing techniques, we identified de novo CACNA1E variants in 30 individuals with DEE, characterized by refractory infantile-onset seizures, severe hypotonia, and profound developmental impairment, often with congenital contractures, macrocephaly, hyperkinetic movement disorders, and early death. Most of the 14, partially recurring, variants cluster within the cytoplasmic ends of all four S6 segments, which form the presumed CaV2.3 channel activation gate. Functional analysis of several S6 variants revealed consistent gain-of-function effects comprising facilitated voltage-dependent activation and slowed inactivation. Another variant located in the domain II S4-S5 linker results in facilitated activation and increased current density. Five participants achieved seizure freedom on the anti-epileptic drug topiramate, which blocks R-type calcium channels. We establish pathogenic variants in CACNA1E as a cause of DEEs and suggest facilitated R-type calcium currents as a disease mechanism for human epilepsy and developmental disorders. ? 2018 American Society of Human Genetics","arthrogryposis; CACNA1E, ion channel; calcium channel; epilepsy","topiramate; CACNA1E protein, human; calcium channel R type; cation transport protein; adolescent; adult; Article; brain disease; cacna1e gene; calcium channelopathy; calcium current; child; clinical article; contracture; current density; developmental delay; dyskinesia; epilepsy; female; gene; genetic variability; human; hyperkinesia; macrocephaly; male; motor dysfunction; muscle hypotonia; preschool child; priority journal; school child; seizure; young adult; Alexander disease; contracture; dyskinesia; epilepsy; genetic variation; genetics; infant; infantile spasm; mental disease; Adolescent; Adult; Calcium Channels, R-Type; Cation Transport Proteins; Child; Child, Preschool; Contracture; Dyskinesias; Epilepsy; Female; Genetic Variation; Humans; Infant; Male; Megalencephaly; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Spasms, Infantile",2-s2.0-85056059896

We sought to compare the impact of E-cigarettes with conventional cigarettes on platelet function in healthy adult smokers and nonsmokers. A crossover single-blind study in 40 healthy participants (20 smokers, 20 nonsmokers, matched for age and sex) was conducted. Each participant smoked a conventional cigarette then returned 1 week later to vape a study E-cigarette with the same nominal nicotine content. Blood samples were drawn shortly before and 5 minutes after each episode and analyzed for platelet aggregation, soluble CD40-ligand (sCD40L) and soluble P-selectin (sP-selectin). At baseline, smokers had significantly higher levels of sCD40L and sP-selectin (all p ?0.01) than nonsmokers. Within 5 minutes of using either a conventional cigarette or E-cigarette, changes in the levels of sCD40L, sP-selectin, and platelet aggregation (all p ?0.01) were detectable in both smokers and nonsmokers. In smokers, there were no significant changes in sCD40L and sP-selectin but there was a significant increase in platelet aggregation. In nonsmokers, there was a significant increase in all markers of platelet activation following both cigarette and E-cigarette use. Both traditional and E-cigarettes have short-term effects on platelet activation, although in nonsmokers the use of E-cigarettes had a less important impact. In conclusion, we provide the first comparison data of the acute impact of Tobacco-cigarette and E-cigarette smoking on the platelet function in smokers and nonsmokers. ? 2018",,CD40 ligand; nicotine; PADGEM protein; biological marker; CD40 ligand; PADGEM protein; adult; Article; blood sampling; comparative study; controlled study; female; human; human cell; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; smoking; thrombocyte activation; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombocyte function; vaping; blood; clinical trial; crossover procedure; drug effect; electronic cigarette; single blind procedure; smoking; vaping; Adult; Biomarkers; CD40 Ligand; Cross-Over Studies; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Female; Humans; Male; Non-Smokers; P-Selectin; Platelet Aggregation; Single-Blind Method; Smokers; Tobacco Smoking; Vaping,2-s2.0-85054099938

However, how such feedback and feedforward connections are modulated in the state induced by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is poorly understood. In this study, an auditory oddball paradigm was presented to healthy participants (16 males, 4 female) under LSD and placebo, and brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Scalp level Event Related Fields (ERF) revealed reduced neural adaptation to familiar stimuli, and a blunted neural 'surprise’ response to novel stimuli in the LSD condition. Dynamic causal modelling revealed that both the presentation of novel stimuli and LSD modulate backward extrinsic connectivity within a task-activated fronto-temporal network, as well as intrinsic connectivity in the primary auditory cortex. These findings show consistencies with those of previous studies of schizophrenia and ketamine but also studies of reduced consciousness – suggesting that rather than being a marker of conscious level per se, backward connectivity may index modulations of perceptual learning common to a variety of altered states of consciousness, perhaps united by a shared altered sensitivity to environmental stimuli. Since recent evidence suggests that the psychedelic state may correspond to a heightened ‘level’ of consciousness with respect to the normal waking state, our data warrant a re-examination of the top-down hypotheses of conscious level and suggest that several altered states may feature this specific biophysical effector.

The prognosis of older acute myeloid leukemia patients is generally poor. While genetic markers have become important tools for risk stratification and treatment selection in young and middle-aged patients, their applicability in very old patients is less clear. We sought to validate existing genetic risk classification systems and identify additional factors associated with outcomes in intensively treated patients aged ?75 years. In 151 patients who received induction chemotherapy in the AMLCG-1999 trial, we investigated recurrently mutated genes using a targeted sequencing assay covering 64 genes. The median number of mutated genes per patient was four. The most commonly mutated genes were TET2 (42%), DNMT3A (35%), NPM1 (32%), SRSF2 (25%) and ASXL1 (21%). The complete remission rate was 44% and the 3-year survival was 21% for the entire cohort. While adverse-risk cytogenetics (MRC classification) were associated with shorter overall survival (P=0.001), NPM1 and FLT3-ITD mutations (present in 18%) did not have a significant impact on overall survival. Notably, none of the 13 IDH1-mutated patients (9%) reached complete remission. Consequently, the overall survival of this subgroup was significantly shorter than that of IDH1-wildtype patients (P<0.001). In summary, even among very old, intensively treated, acute myeloid leukemia patients, adverse-risk cytogenetics predict inferior survival. The spectrum and relevance of driver gene mutations in elderly patients differs from that in younger patients. Our data implicate IDH1 mutations as a novel marker for chemorefractory disease and inferior prognosis.

However, whether it plays a role in the pathogenesis of post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PPDM) remains unknown. Objective: To investigate the associations between markers of lipid metabolism and pro-inflammatory cytokines in individuals after acute pancreatitis (AP) in general, and in individuals with abnormal glucose metabolism (AGM) following AP in particular. Methods: Fasting blood samples were collected to measure markers of lipid metabolism (apolipoprotein-B, cholesterol, free fatty acids (FFA), glycerol, high and low-density lipoproteins, triglycerides) and cytokines (interleukin (IL)-6, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) α). Linear regression analysis was conducted. Four statistical models were used to adjust for patient- and pancreatitis-related characteristics. Results: A total of 83 patients were recruited. IL-6 was significantly associated with glycerol in all models (p <.05), with glycerol levels increasing by 106% in individuals with AGM after AP (p <.05) compared to a 30.3% increase in individuals with normal glucose metabolism (NGM) (p >.05). TNFα was significantly associated with FFA (p =.015) in individuals with AGM after AP in the most adjusted model, with FFA levels increasing by 314% in these individuals compared to a 162% decrease in individuals with NGM after AP (p >.05). Conclusions: Lipolysis appears to be an important pathogenetic mechanism in glucose derangements after diseases of the exocrine pancreas. IL-6 and TNFα are the driving forces behind lipolysis in individuals with AGM after AP. Modulation of lipolysis may be a promising therapeutic modality. ? 2017, ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",acute pancreatitis; Lipolysis; post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus; pro-inflammatory cytokines,"biological marker; glycerol; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; TNF protein, human; tumor necrosis factor; acute disease; adult; aged; blood; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; female; human; immunology; lipolysis; male; metabolism; middle aged; New Zealand; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreatitis; pathophysiology; public hospital; recurrent disease; risk factor; severity of illness index; upregulation; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glycerol; Hospitals, Municipal; Humans; Interleukin-6; Lipolysis; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Pancreatitis; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85038028396

Circulatory miRNAs are either protein-bound or packaged within vesicles (exosomes). Ten young men (24.6 = 4.0 yr) underwent a single bout of high-intensity interval cycling exercise. Vastus lateralis biopsies and plasma were collected immediately before and after exercise, as well as 4 h following the exercise bout. Twenty-nine miRNAs previously reported to be regulated by acute exercise were assessed within muscle, venous plasma, and enriched circulatory exosomes via qRT-PCR. Of the 29 targeted miRNAs, 11 were altered in muscle, 8 in plasma, and 9 in the exosome fraction. Although changes in muscle and plasma expression were bidirectional, all regulated exosomal miRNAs increased following exercise. Three miRNAs were altered in all three sample pools (miR-1-3p,-16-5p, and-222-3p), three in both muscle and plasma (miR-21-5p,-134-3p, and-107), three in both muscle and exosomes (miR-23a-3p,-208a-3p, and-150-5p), and three in both plasma and exosomes (miR-486-5p,-126-3p, and-378a-5p). There was a marked discrepancy between the observed alterations between sample pools.

Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of all studies examining the impact of interventions that were specifically designed to reduce suicide-related behavior in young people. Findings: Ninety-nine studies were identified, of which 52 were conducted in clinical settings, 31 in educational or workplace settings, and 15 in community settings. Around half were randomized controlled trials. Large scale interventions delivered in both clinical and educational settings appear to reduce self-harm and suicidal ideation post-intervention, and to a lesser extent at follow-up. In community settings, multi-faceted, place-based approaches seem to have an impact. Study quality was limited. Interpretation: Overall whilst the number and range of studies is encouraging, gaps exist. Few studies were conducted in low-middle income countries or with demographic populations known to be at increased risk. Similarly, there was a lack of studies conducted in primary care, universities and workplaces. However, we identified that specific youth suicide-prevention interventions can reduce self-harm and suicidal ideation; these types of intervention need testing in high-quality studies. ? 2018",Meta-analysis; Self-harm; Suicide prevention; Systematic review; Young people,Article; automutilation; demography; follow up; health education; human; low income country; middle income country; primary medical care; suicidal behavior; suicidal ideation; suicide; systematic review; workplace,2-s2.0-85063496578

This systematic review aims to formulate PROSPECT (PROcedure SPECific Postoperative Pain ManagemenT) recommendations to reduce postoperative pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Methods: Randomised controlled trials published in the English language from January 2006 (date of last PROSPECT review) to December 2017, assessing analgesic, anaesthetic, or operative interventions for laparoscopic cholecystectomy in adults, and reporting pain scores, were retrieved from MEDLINE and Cochrane databases using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) search protocols. PROSPECT methodology was used, and recommendations were formulated after review and discussion by the PROSPECT group (an international group of leading pain specialists and surgeons). Results: Of 1988 randomised controlled trials identified, 258 met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. The studies were of mixed methodological quality, and quantitative analysis was not performed because of heterogeneous study design and how outcomes were reported. Conclusions: We recommend basic analgesic techniques: paracetamol + NSAID or cyclooxygenase-2 specific inhibitor + surgical site local anaesthetic infiltration. Paracetamol and NSAID should be started before or during operation with dexamethasone (GRADE A). Opioid should be reserved for rescue analgesia only (GRADE B). Gabapentanoids, intraperitoneal local anaesthetic, and transversus abdominis plane blocks are not recommended (GRADE D) unless basic analgesia is not possible. Surgically, we recommend low-pressure pneumoperitoneum, postprocedure saline lavage, and aspiration of pneumoperitoneum (GRADE A).

AF is the most common cardiac rhythm disturbance and affects ?2% of the general population in industrialized countries. Automatic AF detection in clinics remains a challenging task due to the high inter-patient variability of ECGs, and unsatisfactory existing approaches for AF diagnosis (e.g. atrial or ventricular activity-based analyses). Approach: We have developed RhythmNet, a 21-layer 1D convolutional recurrent neural network, trained using 8528 single-lead ECG recordings from the 2017 PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology (CinC) Challenge, to classify ECGs of different rhythms including AF automatically. Our RhythmNet architecture contained 16 convolutions to extract features directly from raw ECG waveforms, followed by three recurrent layers to process ECGs of varying lengths and to detect arrhythmia events in long recordings. Large 15 × 1 convolutional filters were used to effectively learn the detailed variations of the signal within small time-frames such as the P-waves and QRS complexes. We employed residual connections throughout RhythmNet, along with batch-normalization and rectified linear activation units to improve convergence during training. Main results: We evaluated our algorithm on 3658 testing data and obtained an F 1 accuracy of 82% for classifying sinus rhythm, AF, and other arrhythmias. RhythmNet was also ranked 5th in the 2017 CinC Challenge. Significance: Potentially, our approach could aid AF diagnosis in clinics and be used for patient self-monitoring to improve the early detection and effective treatment of AF. ? 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",atrial fibrillation; convolutional neural networks; deep learning; electrocardiograms; recurrent neural networks,"artificial neural network; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; electrocardiography; evaluation study; heart arrhythmia; human; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electrocardiography; Humans; Neural Networks (Computer); Pattern Recognition, Automated; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-85054674245

A major drawback for its clinical translation is the intrinsic weakness of Raman effects. Highly sensitive equipment and optimal measurement conditions are generally applied to overcome this drawback. However, these equipment are usually bulky, expensive and may also be easily influenced by surrounding environment. In this preliminary work, a low-resolution fiber-optic Raman sensing system is applied to evaluate the diagnostic potential of Raman spectroscopy to identify different bladder pathologies ex vivo. A total number of 262 spectra taken from 32 bladder specimens are included in this study. These spectra are categorized into 3 groups by histopathological analysis, namely normal bladder tissues, low-grade bladder tumors and high-grade bladder tumors. Principal component analysis fed artificial neural network are used to train a classification model for the spectral data with 10-fold cross-validation and an overall prediction accuracy of 93.1% is obtained. The sensitivities and specificities for normal bladder tissues, low-grade bladder tumors and high-grade bladder tumors are 88.5% and 95.1%, 90.3% and 98%, and 97.5% and 96.4%, respectively.

Although the favored mechanism is ablation of the airway smooth muscle layer, because bronchial thermoplasty treats only a small number of central airways, there is ongoing debate regarding its precise method of action. Our aim in the present study was to elucidate the underlying method of action behind bronchial thermoplasty. We employed a combination of extensive human lung specimens and novel computational methods. Whole left lungs were acquired from the Prairie Provinces Fatal Asthma Study. Subjects were classified as control (n = 31), nonfatal asthma (n = 32), or fatal asthma (n = 25). Simulated lungs for each group were constructed stochastically, and flow distributions and functional indicators (e.g., resistance) were quantified both before and after a 75% reduction in airway smooth muscle in the “thermoplasty-treated” airways. Bronchial thermoplasty triggered global redistribution of clustered flow patterns wherein structural changes to the treated central airways led to a reopening cascade in the small airways and significant improvement in lung function via reduced spatial heterogeneity of flow patterns. This mechanism accounted for progressively greater efficacy of thermoplasty with both severity of asthma and degree of muscle activation, broadly consistent with existing clinical findings. We report a probable mechanism of action for bronchial thermoplasty: alteration of lung-wide flow patterns in response to structural alteration of the treated central airways. This insight could lead to improved therapy via patient-specific, tailored versions of the treatment-as well as to implications for more conventional asthma therapies.

The contribution of changes in bile acids (BAs) and fibroblast growth factor19 (FGF19) to such metabolic improvements is unclear. Methods: We examined associations between changes in BAs, FGF19 (fasting and prandial), with changes in body weight, glycemia, and other metabolic variables in 61 obese patients with T2DM before and 1?year after randomization to SG or RYGB. Results: Weight loss and diabetes remission (defined by HbA1c < 39?mmol/mol [< 5.7%] in the absence of glucose-lowering therapy) after RYGB and SG was similar (mean weight loss ? 29 vs ? 31?kg, p = 0.50; diabetes remission proportion 37.5 vs 34%, p = 1.0). Greater increments in fasting and prandial levels of total, secondary, and unconjugated BAs were seen after RYGB than SG. Fasting and prandial increases in total (r = ? 0.3, p = 0.01; r = ? 0.2, p = 0.04), secondary (r = ? 0.3, p = 0.01; r = ? 0.4, p = 0.01) and unconjugated BA (r = ? 0.3, p = 0.01; r = 0.4, p < 0.01) correlated with decreases in HbA1c, but not weight. Changes in 12α-OH/non 12α-OH were positively associated with prandial glucose increments (r = 0.2, p = 0.03), HbA1c (r = 0.3, p = 0.01), and negatively associated with changes in insulinogenc index (r = ? 0.3, p = 0.01). Only changes in prandial FGF19 were negatively associated with HbA1c (r = ? 0.4, p < 0.01) and visceral fat (r = ? 0.3, p = 0.04). Conclusions/interpretation: The association between increases in secondary, unconjugated BAs and improvements in HBA1c (but not weight) achieved after both RYGB and SG suggest manipulation of BA as a potential strategy for controlling T2DM through weight-independent means. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bariatric surgery; Bile acids; Energy expenditure; HbA1c; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; Sleeve gastrectomy,"bile acid; C peptide; fibroblast growth factor 19; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; bile acid; FGF19 protein, human; fibroblast growth factor; adult; Article; blood sampling; body fat; body height; body weight; body weight loss; bone mineral; controlled study; correlational study; diabetic patient; disease association; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat free mass; female; food intake; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; homeostasis model assessment; human; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; low calorie diet; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; oral glucose tolerance test; postoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index; randomized controlled trial; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; surgical patient; visual analog scale; blood; complication; follow up; gastrectomy; gastric bypass surgery; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; Bile Acids and Salts; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Follow-Up Studies; Gastrectomy; Gastric Bypass; Humans; Obesity; Weight Loss",2-s2.0-85049650473

Evidence acquisition: Four databases covering the period up to December 2016 were searched and analyzed (February 2017). Data were extracted by two independent reviewers. For the meta-analyses, the estimated regression coefficients (β) and 95% CIs were analyzed for BMI, waist circumference, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Pooled relative rate and 95% CIs were calculated for fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance values. Hazard ratios were extracted from studies of all-cause mortality risk. Evidence synthesis: Ten studies (with 17,390 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Reallocation of 30 minutes of sedentary time to light-intensity physical activity was associated with reductions in waist circumference, fasting insulin, and all-cause mortality risk; and with an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Reallocating 30 minutes of sedentary time to moderate to vigorous physical activity was associated with reductions in BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and all-cause mortality (not pooled) and with an increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conclusions: Replacing sedentary time with either light-intensity physical activity or moderate to vigorous physical activity may be beneficial, but when sedentary time is replaced with moderate to vigorous physical activity, the predicted impacts are stronger and apparent for a broader range of risk markers. These findings point to potential benefits of replacing sedentary time with light-intensity physical activity, which may benefit those less able to tolerate or accommodate higher-intensity activities, including many older adults. ? 2018",,"glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; all cause mortality; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; exercise intensity; human; light intensity physical activity; moderate to vigorous physical activity; physical activity; Review; sedentary lifestyle; sedentary time; sitting; systematic review; waist circumference; accelerometry; blood; cardiovascular disease; exercise; glucose blood level; meta analysis; metabolism; physiology; procedures; risk factor; Accelerometry; Blood Glucose; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol, HDL; Exercise; Humans; Risk Factors; Sedentary Behavior; Waist Circumference",2-s2.0-85047741532

Evofosfamide was assessed in 22 genomically characterized cell lines and 7 cell line-derived xenograft (CDX), patient-derived xenograft (PDX), orthotopic, and syngeneic tumor models. Biomarker analysis used RNA sequencing, whole-exome sequencing, and whole-genome CRISPR knockout screens. Five advanced/metastatic HNSCC patients received evofosfamide monotherapy (480 mg/m2 qw × 3 each month) in a phase 2 study. Evofosfamide was potent and highly selective for hypoxic HNSCC cells. Proliferative rate was a predominant evofosfamide sensitivity determinant and a proliferation metagene correlated with activity in CDX models. Evofosfamide showed efficacy as monotherapy and with radiotherapy in PDX models, augmented CTLA-4 blockade in syngeneic tumors, and reduced hypoxia in nodes disseminated from an orthotopic model.

The molecular etiology of RDEB SCC, which arises at sites of sustained tissue damage, is unknown. We performed detailed molecular analysis using whole-exome, whole-genome, and RNA sequencing of 27 RDEB SCC tumors, including multiple tumors from the same patient and multiple regions from five individual tumors. We report that driver mutations were shared with spontaneous, ultraviolet (UV) light-induced cutaneous SCC (UV SCC) and head and neck SCC (HNSCC) and did not explain the early presentation or aggressive nature of RDEB SCC. Instead, endogenous mutation processes associated with apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide-like (APOBEC) deaminases dominated RDEB SCC. APOBEC mutation signatures were enhanced throughout RDEB SCC tumor evolution, relative to spontaneous UV SCC and HNSCC mutation profiles. Sixty-seven percent of RDEB SCC driver mutations was found to emerge as a result of APOBEC and other endogenous mutational processes previously associated with age, potentially explaining a >1000-fold increased incidence and the early onset of these SCCs. Human papillomavirus-negative basal and mesenchymal subtypes of HNSCC harbored enhanced APOBEC mutational signatures and transcriptomes similar to those of RDEB SCC, suggesting that APOBEC deaminases drive other subtypes of SCC. Collectively, these data establish specific mutagenic mechanisms associated with chronic tissue damage. Our findings reveal a cause for cancers arising at sites of persistent inflammation and identify potential therapeutic avenues to treat RDEB SCC.

The aim of this study was to assess the safety of Tdap vaccine administered to pregnant women as part of a national maternal immunisation programme. Methods: We conducted a national retrospective observational study using linked administrative New Zealand datasets. The study population consisted of pregnant women eligible to receive funded Tdap vaccination from 28 to 38 weeks gestation in 2013. Primary study outcomes were based on prioritised adverse events for the assessment of vaccine safety in pregnant women, as defined by WHO and Brighton Collaboration taskforces. We examined the effect of Tdap vaccination on prioritised maternal outcomes using Cox proportional hazard models. Adjusted hazard ratios controlled for key confounding variables. Results: In the cohort of 68,550 women eligible to receive funded antenatal Tdap vaccination during 2013, 8178 (11.9%) were vaccinated and 60,372 (88.1%) were unvaccinated. The use of Tdap in pregnancy was not associated with an increase in the rate of primary outcomes, including preterm labour; pre-eclampsia; pre-eclampsia with severe features; eclampsia; gestational hypertension; fetal growth restriction; or post-partum haemorrhage. Tdap also did not increase secondary outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus; antenatal bleeding; placental abruption; premature rupture of membranes; preterm delivery; fetal distress; chorioamnionitis; or, maternal fever during or after labour. Lactation disorders was the only secondary maternal outcome with a significantly increased hazard ratio. Tdap vaccine had a protective effect on pre-eclampsia with severe features, preterm labour, preterm delivery, and antenatal bleeding. Conclusion: We did not detect any biologically plausible adverse maternal outcomes following Tdap vaccination during pregnancy. This study provides further assurance that Tdap administration during pregnancy is not associated with unexpected safety risks. ? 2018",Maternal; Pertussis; Post-marketing surveillance; Pregnancy; Tdap; Vaccine safety,"diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; diphtheria pertussis tetanus vaccine; adult; Article; chorioamnionitis; cohort analysis; disease severity; drug safety; female; fetus distress; fever; gestational age; hazard ratio; human; infection prevention; intrauterine growth retardation; lactation disorder; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; maternal welfare; observational study; outcome assessment; pertussis; population research; postmarketing surveillance; postpartum hemorrhage; preeclampsia; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; premature fetus membrane rupture; premature labor; priority journal; retrospective study; solutio placentae; treatment duration; vaccination; women's health; chemically induced; chorioamnionitis; maternal hypertension; New Zealand; postmarketing surveillance; preeclampsia; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prematurity; proportional hazards model; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; vaccination; young adult; Adult; Chorioamnionitis; Diphtheria-Tetanus-acellular Pertussis Vaccines; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; New Zealand; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnant Women; Premature Birth; Product Surveillance, Postmarketing; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Vaccination; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85049929392

Prophylactic corticosteroids in singleton preterm pregnancies accelerate lung maturation and reduce the incidence of respiratory complications. Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effect of prophylactic corticosteroid administration before elective caesarean section at term, as compared to usual management without corticosteroids, in reducing neonatal respiratory morbidity and admission to special care with respiratory complications. Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (14 June 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials comparing prophylactic antenatal corticosteroid administration (betamethasone or dexamethasone) with placebo or with no treatment, given before elective caesarean section at term (at or after 37 weeks of gestation). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: We included four trials (3956 women and 3893 neonates) at a moderate risk of bias, comparing prophylactic administration of betamethasone or dexamethasone versus placebo or usual treatment without steroids in term elective caesarean section. Women randomised to treatment group received either two intramuscular doses of betamethasone in the 48 hours before delivery, or intramuscular dexamethasone (two or four doses) prior to delivery (at 37 weeks' gestation or 48 hours before delivery), and were compared to the control group who received a saline placebo or treatment as usual. Prophylactic antenatal corticosteroid administration appeared to decrease the risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (risk ratio (RR) 0.48; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.27 to 0.87; 4 studies; 3817 participants; low-quality evidence), transient tachypnoea of the neonate (TTN) (RR 0.43; 95% CI 0.29 to 0.65; 4 studies; 3821 participants; low-quality evidence), admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for respiratory morbidity (RR 0.42; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.79; 3 studies; 3441 participants), and admission to neonatal special care (all levels) for respiratory complications (RR 0.45; 95% CI 0.22 to 0.90; 1 study; 942 participants; low-quality evidence). Administration of antenatal corticosteroids also appeared to reduce admission to neonatal special care (RR 0.62; 95% CI 0.43 to 0.89; 2 studies; 2169 participants) and neonatal intensive care (RR 0.14; 95% CI 0.03 to 0.61; 1 study; 452 participants) for any indication, compared to placebo or usual care. Finally, prophylactic antenatal corticosteroids also appeared to reduce the length of stay in NICU by 2.70 days (mean difference (MD) -2.70; 95% CI -2.76 to -2.64; 2 studies; 32 participants). No reduction was found in the need for mechanical ventilation (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.27 to 1.68; 3 studies; 3441 participants; very-low quality), perinatal death (RR 0.67; 95% CI 0.11 to 4.10; 4 studies; 3893 participants) or neonatal sepsis (RR 1.00; 95% CI 0.06 to 15.95; 2 studies; 2214 participants). There were no reported events of neonatal respiratory complications (other than RDS and tachypnoea of the newborn (TTN)), chronic lung disease, duration of mechanical ventilation or maternal postpartum infection, therefore results on these outcomes are non-estimable. The studies did not provide data on other pre-defined outcomes. The quality of evidence, as assessed using GRADE was low for the outcomes of RDS, TTN and admission to NICU for respiratory morbidity, indicating that the true effect could potentially be substantially different from our estimate of effect. Authors' conclusions: The results from the four trials are promising, but more high-quality studies with larger sample sizes that are adequately powered to detect the effect of prophylactic antenatal corticosteroids on outcomes of respiratory morbidity are needed, given the potential of the current studies for bias. Consideration should be given to the balance between statistical significance and clinical significance, particularly in view of the low event rates of significant respiratory morbidity (RDS or admission to NICU for respiratory complications) in this population. In addition, further trials on the long-term outcomes of these infants are needed to identify any potential harms and complications of antenatal corticosteroid administration at term. ? 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"betamethasone; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; placebo; betamethasone; corticosteroid; dexamethasone; artificial ventilation; cesarean section; clinical outcome; comparative study; elective surgery; gestational age; hospital admission; human; length of stay; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; newborn care; newborn morbidity; newborn sepsis; obstetric delivery; perinatal death; prenatal care; priority journal; respiratory distress syndrome; respiratory tract disease; Review; systematic review; tachypnea; wound infection; apnea; cesarean section; elective surgery; female; meta analysis; neonatal respiratory distress syndrome; pregnancy; randomized controlled trial (topic); statistics and numerical data; tachypnea; term birth; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Apnea; Betamethasone; Cesarean Section; Dexamethasone; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Patient Admission; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiration, Artificial; Respiratory Distress Syndrome, Newborn; Tachypnea; Term Birth",2-s2.0-85051296736

Pancreas volume is a holistic quantitative measure of pancreas size but the clinical relevance of pancreas volumetry is poorly understood. Areas covered: The aim was to systematically review studies in adults that used computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging to measure pancreas volume in health and disease, to determine normal pancreas volume range, and to quantify changes in pancreas volume that are associated with disease. Expert commentary: The normal pancreas volume range in adults is 71–83?cm3, with no statistically significant difference between men and women. Type 2 diabetes and type 1 diabetes are associated with a progressively reduced pancreas volume. Overweight and obesity are associated with a progressively increased pancreas volume. There is a paucity of studies on pancreas volume in the setting of diseases of the exocrine pancreas, which should become a research priority in the future. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",computed tomography imaging; diabetes; magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; Pancreas volume; pancreatic diseases,"autoimmune pancreatitis; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; digestive tract parameters; disease association; health status; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; outcome assessment; pancreas disease; pancreas volume; population research; remission; Review; systematic review; anatomy and histology; complication; diabetic complication; diagnostic imaging; meta analysis; normal human; organ size; pancreas; pancreas disease; pathology; reference value; x-ray computed tomography; Diabetes Complications; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Organ Size; Overweight; Pancreas; Pancreatic Diseases; Reference Values; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85050395320

Most animal models of diabetic retinopathy are hyperglycaemia-only models that do not account for the significant role that inflammation plays in the development of the disease. In the present study, we present data on the establishment of a new animal model of diabetic retinopathy that incorporates both hyperglycaemia and inflammation. We hypothesized that inflammation may trigger and worsen the development of diabetic retinopathy in a hyperglycaemic environment. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1β and TNF-α, were therefore injected into the vitreous of non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. CD1 mice were used as same genetic background controls. Fundus and optical coherence tomography images were obtained before (day 0) as well as on days 2 and 7 after intravitreal cytokine injection to assess vessel dilation and beading, retinal and vitreous hyper-reflective foci and retinal thickness. Astrogliosis and microgliosis were assessed using immunohis-tochemistry. Results showed that intravitreal cytokines induced vessel dilation, beading, severe vitreous hyper-reflective foci, retinal oedema, increased astrogliosis and microglia upregulation in diabetic NOD mice. Intravitreal injection of inflammatory cytokines into the eyes of diabetic mice therefore appears to provide a new model of diabetic retinopathy that could be used for the study of disease progression and treatment strategies. ? 2018 Mugisho et al.

This paper compares both countries’ approaches to health equity to inform policy efforts. We developed a conceptual model that highlights how government and private policies influence health equity by impacting the healthcare system (access to care, structure and quality of care, payment of care), and integration of healthcare system with social services. These policies are shaped by each country's culture, history, and values. Aotearoa/NZ and U.S. share strong aspirational goals for health equity in their national health strategy documents. Unfortunately, implemented policies are frequently not explicit in how they address health inequities, and often do not align with evidence-based approaches known to improve equity. To authentically commit to achieving health equity, nations should: 1) Explicitly design quality of care and payment policies to achieve equity, holding the healthcare system accountable through public monitoring and evaluation, and supporting with adequate resources; 2) Address all determinants of health for individuals and communities with coordinated approaches, integrated funding streams, and shared accountability metrics across health and social sectors; 3) Share power authentically with racial/ethnic minorities and promote indigenous peoples’ self-determination; 4) Have free, frank, and fearless discussions about impacts of structural racism, colonialism, and white privilege, ensuring that policies and programs explicitly address root causes. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Access to care; Equity; Inequity; Outcomes; Payment; Quality of care,adult; article; colonialism; ethnic group; female; funding; government; health care system; health equity; human; human experiment; indigenous people; male; monitoring; New Zealand; public health; racism; social work; United States; economics; ethnology; health care disparity; health care planning; health care policy; New Zealand; procedures; program evaluation; social responsibility; United States; Health Equity; Health Plan Implementation; Health Policy; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; New Zealand; Program Evaluation; Social Responsibility; United States,2-s2.0-85049070018

Batch studies were conducted with the aim of evaluating the sorption of these two emerging contaminants in six New Zealand agricultural soils of contrasting physico-chemical properties. Kinetic studies revealed that metformin and guanylurea sorption in Te Kowhai soil was very rapid initially achieving 90% sorption within the first 4 and 13 h, respectively. Fit of several isotherm models to the measured batch sorption data showed that the hybrid models Langmuir-Freundlich and Redlich-Peterson best described the isotherms. Freundlich isotherm showed higher linearity for guanylurea (nF = 0.58–0.93) in all soils compared to metformin (nF = 0.25–0.71). A linear isotherm was fitted at environmentally relevant low concentrations (&lt; 3 mg/L) of target compounds and calculated values of sorption distribution coefficient (Kd) were in the range of 8.97 to 53.49 L/kg for metformin and between 10.6 and 37.51 L/kg for guanylurea. Sorption of both metformin and guanylurea was dependent on the soil characteristics, however, no generalisation could be made as to which had higher affinity to soils studied. Pearson's correlation and multiple regression analyses indicate that Si/Al (p = 0.042) and clay (p = 0.015) significantly influenced metformin Kd values, whereas the soil's cation exchange capacity (p = 0.024) is the single most significant factor determining guanylurea sorption in soils. It is likely that the type of minerals present in soils and its ion-exchange capacity could play an important role in metformin and guanylurea sorption, respectively. ? 2018",Guanylurea; Isotherm; Kinetics; Metformin; Sorption,"Agriculture; Aquatic organisms; Correlation methods; Dyes; Enzyme kinetics; Groundwater; Ion exchange; Isotherms; Linear transformations; Regression analysis; Soils; Surface waters; Cation exchange capacities; Distribution coefficient; Guanylurea; Metformins; Multiple regression analysis; Physicochemical property; Sorption characteristics; Surface water and groundwaters; Sorption; drug metabolite; guanylurea; metformin; unclassified drug; antidiabetic agent; metformin; adsorption; agricultural soil; drug; environmental fate; ion exchange; physicochemical property; reaction kinetics; soil property; absorption; agricultural land; Article; cation exchange; concentration (parameters); drug transformation; ion exchange; isotherm; kinetics; linear system; measurement; New Zealand; partition coefficient; physical chemistry; priority journal; soil pollution; soil property; statistical model; adsorption; analysis; chemical model; chemistry; soil; soil pollutant; New Zealand; Adsorption; Hypoglycemic Agents; Kinetics; Metformin; Models, Chemical; Soil; Soil Pollutants",2-s2.0-85042687030

It is unclear whether treating BP to guideline recommended levels could normalize the rise in BP during exercise, which is mediated by the metaboreflex. We aimed to assess the BP response to incremental exercise testing and metaboreflex activation in treated-controlled hypertension (n=16), treated-uncontrolled hypertension (n=16), and untreated hypertension (n=11) and 16 control participants with normal BP (n=16). All groups were matched for age and body mass index. BP was measured during an incremental Vo 2 peak test on a cycle ergometer and during metaboreflex isolation using postexercise ischemia. Data were analyzed using 2-way ANOVA with Tukey test for multiple comparisons. Aerobic fitness was similar among groups (P=0.97). The rise in absolute systolic BP from baseline at peak exercise was similar in controlled, uncontrolled, and untreated hypertension but greater compared with normotensive controls (Δ71±3, 81±7, 79±8.5 versus 47±5 mm Hg; P=0.0001). Metaboreflex sensitivity was also similar in controlled, uncontrolled, and untreated hypertension but augmented compared with normotensive controls (Δsystolic BP: 21±2, 28±2, 25±3 versus 12±2 mm Hg; P<0.0001). An amplified pressor response to exercise occurred in patients taking antihypertensive medication, despite having controlled BP at rest and was potentially caused (in part) by enhanced metaboreflex sensitivity. Poor BP control during exercise, partially mediated by the metaboreflex, may contribute to the heightened risk of an adverse cardiovascular event even in treated-controlled patients. ? 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.",blood pressure; exercise; humans; hypertension,angiotensin receptor antagonist; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; antihypertensive agent; aerobic exercise; aged; antihypertensive therapy; Article; bicycle ergometry; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure regulation; cardiovascular risk; case control study; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; exercise intensity; exercise test; female; hand grip; heart muscle ischemia; human; hypertension; hypertensive patient; isometric exercise; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; metaboreflex; muscle reflex; plethysmography; postexercise ischemia; pressor response; priority journal; systolic blood pressure; venous oxygen tension; blood pressure; body mass; exercise; exercise test; follow up; hypertension; oxygen consumption; pathophysiology; physiology; pressoreceptor reflex; procedures; prognosis; retrospective study; treatment failure; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Body Mass Index; Exercise; Exercise Test; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Failure,2-s2.0-85053787692

In contrast, an accurate diagnosis of Early CP is not possible using imaging criteria alone. If this were possible and early treatment instituted, the later, irreversible features and complications of CP could possibly be prevented. Method: An international working group supported by four major pancreas societies (IAP, APA, JPS, and EPC) and a PancreasFest working group sought to develop a consensus definition and diagnostic criteria for Early CP. Ten statements (S1-10) concerning Early CP were used to gauge consensus on the Early CP concept using anonymous voting with a 9 point Likert scale. Consensus required an alpha ?0.80. Results: No consensus statement could be developed for a definition of Early-CP or diagnostic criteria. There was consensus on 5 statements: (S2) The word “Early” in early chronic pancreatitis is used to describe disease state, not disease duration. (S4) Early CP defines a stage of CP with preserved pancreatic function and potentially reversible features. (S8) Genetic variants are important risk factors for Early CP and can add specificity to the likely etiology, but they are neither necessary nor sufficient to make a diagnosis. (S9) Environmental risk factors can provide evidence to support the diagnosis of Early CP, but are neither necessary nor sufficient to make a diagnosis. (S10) The differential diagnosis for Early CP includes other disorders with morphological and functional features that overlap with CP. Conclusions: Morphology based diagnosis of Early CP is not possible without additional information. New approaches to the accurate diagnosis of Early CP will require a mechanistic definition that considers risk factors, biomarkers, clinical context and new models of disease. Such a definition will require prospective validation. ? 2018",Acute pancreatitis; Alcohol; Chronic pancreatitis; Classification; Diagnosis; Endoscopic ultrasound; Fibrosis; Genetic; Model,abdominal radiography; acute pancreatitis; alcohol consumption; Article; chronic pancreatitis; Cronbach alpha coefficient; diagnostic accuracy; differential diagnosis; disease duration; early chronic pancreatitis; environmental factor; genetic screening; genetic variability; human; Japan; nonhuman; pancreas function; practice guideline; priority journal; risk factor; smoking,2-s2.0-85048820190

However, challenges are posed by the high variability and complexity of structural features in such images, in addition to imaging artifacts. Further, the conventional approach of manual thresholding is labor-intensive, and highly sensitive to inter- and intra-image intensity variations. An accurate and robust automated segmentation method is of high interest. We propose and evaluate an elegant convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for segmentation of histological images, particularly those with Masson's trichrome stain. The network comprises 11 successive convolutional – rectified linear unit – batch normalization layers. It outperformed state-of-the-art CNNs on a dataset of cardiac histological images (labeling fibrosis, myocytes, and background) with a Dice similarity coefficient of 0.947. With 100 times fewer (only 300,000) trainable parameters than the state-of-the-art, our CNN is less susceptible to overfitting, and is efficient. Additionally, it retains image resolution from input to output, captures fine-grained details, and can be trained end-to-end smoothly. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first deep CNN tailored to the problem of concern, and may potentially be extended to solve similar segmentation tasks to facilitate investigations into pathology and clinical treatment. ? 2018",Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Fibrosis; Histology; Image segmentation,"Convolution; Deep learning; Histology; Image resolution; Neural networks; Automated segmentation method; Clinical treatments; Conventional approach; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Fibrosis; Image intensity variations; Similarity coefficients; Image segmentation; accuracy; animal tissue; Article; artificial neural network; cardiac muscle cell; controlled study; convolutional neural network; diabetes mellitus; dice similarity coefficient; evaluation study; fibrosis; heart atrium; histology; image segmentation; machine learning; Masson trichrome staining; nonhuman; priority journal; staining; statistical model; computer assisted diagnosis; cytochemistry; diagnostic imaging; fibrosis; heart disease; human; pathology; procedures; Deep Learning; Fibrosis; Heart Diseases; Histocytochemistry; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Neural Networks (Computer)",2-s2.0-85047268384

One of the most studied oscillations is heart rate variability, which is thought to be beneficial and can serve as an index of a healthy cardiovascular system. Heart rate variability is dampened in many diseases including depression, autoimmune diseases, hypertension, and heart failure. Thus, understanding the interactions that lead to heart rate variability, and its physiological role, could help with prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. In this review, we consider three types of cardiorespiratory interactions: respiratory sinus arrhythmia (variability in heart rate at the frequency of breathing), cardioventilatory coupling (synchronization between the heart beat and the onset of inspiration), and respiratory stroke volume synchronization (the constant phase difference between the right and the left stroke volumes over one respiratory cycle). While the exact physiological role of these oscillations continues to be debated, the redundancies in the mechanisms responsible for its generation and its strong evolutionary conservation point to the importance of cardiorespiratory interactions. The putative mechanisms driving cardiorespiratory oscillations as well as the physiological significance of these oscillations will be reviewed. We suggest that cardiorespiratory interactions have the capacity to both dampen the variability in systemic blood flow as well as improve the efficiency of work done by the heart while maintaining physiological levels of arterial CO2. Given that reduction in variability is a prognostic indicator of disease, we argue that restoration of this variability via pharmaceutical or device-based approaches may be beneficial in prolonging life. ? 2018 American Physiological Society.

A major type of pigments responsible for the colours as well as the health benefits of the cereals are anthocyanins. Focusing on the recent updates, this review summarises the chemical composition of the anthocyanins in diverse cereals including maize, rice, wheat, barley, sorghum, millet, and rye. There is a great diversity in anthocyanin composition among various cereals. Special cereal genotypes with much enhanced anthocyanin content (e.g., endosperm of rice kernels rich in anthocyanins) have been developed by genetic means. The coloured cereals as potential ingredients for functional food production have been subjected to extensive research for health benefits. Both in vitro and in vivo studies on the health effects of the anthocyanins from the cereals have been summarised. The claimed health benefits include anti-oxidation, anti-cancer, glycemic and bodyweight regulation, neuroprotection, retinal protection, hypolipidemia, hepatoprotection, and anti-ageing. These health effects suggest potential uses of the cereal anthocyanins for positive human nutrition. However, clinical and human studies are needed to confirm these claimed health effects. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Bioavailability; Functional food; Grain pigment; in vivo study; Maize; Natural antioxidant; Rice; Wheat,"Ablation; Biochemistry; Functional food; Grain (agricultural product); Nutrition; Bioavailability; In-vivo; Maize; Natural antioxidants; Rice; Wheat; Anthocyanins; anthocyanin; animal; chemistry; color; food grain; functional food; genetically modified food; genetics; healthy diet; human; nutritional value; species difference; transgenic plant; Animals; Anthocyanins; Color; Edible Grain; Food, Genetically Modified; Functional Food; Healthy Diet; Humans; Nutritive Value; Plants, Genetically Modified; Species Specificity",2-s2.0-85046107840

Here we show that loss of global DNA methylation, particularly in intergenic regions and repeat elements, is associated with constitutive (PD-L1CON), versus inducible (PD-L1IND), PD-L1 expression in melanoma cell lines. We further show this is accompanied by transcriptomic up-regulation. De novo epigenetic regulators (e.g., DNMT3A)are strongly correlated with PD-L1 expression and methylome status. Accordingly, decitabine-mediated inhibition of global methylation in melanoma cells leads to increased PD-L1 expression. Moreover, viral mimicry and immune response genes are highly expressed in lymphocyte-negative plus PD-L1-positive melanomas, versus PD-L1-negative melanomas in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). In summary, using integrated genomic analysis we identified that global DNA methylation influences PD-L1 expression in melanoma, and hence melanoma's ability to evade anti-tumor immune responses. These results have implications for combining epigenetic therapy with immunotherapy. ? 2018 The Author(s)Genetics; Genomics; Cancer; Transcriptomics ? 2018 The Author(s)",Cancer; Genetics; Genomics; Transcriptomics,,2-s2.0-85062444440

The most significant harm associated with aspirin is major bleeding, yet there is a paucity of data on bleeding risk in suitable community populations. OBJECTIVE To determine the risk of major bleeding among people without CVD who are not receiving antiplatelet therapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Prospective cohort study of 359 166 individuals aged 30 to 79 years receiving primary care in New Zealand who had CVD risk assessment between 2002 and 2015. Participants were censored at the earliest date on which they had a first major bleeding event, died, or met any baseline cohort exclusion criteria or the study end date of December 31, 2015. Analyses were repeated after excluding people with medical conditions associated with increased bleeding risk (non-high-risk cohort; n=305 057) and after further excluding people receiving other medications associated with increased bleeding risk (nonmedication cohort; n=240 254). EXPOSURES Sex and age group in 10-year bands from 30 to 79 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Risk of a major bleeding event (hospitalization or death associated with bleeding); nonfatal gastrointestinal tract bleeding; and gastrointestinal tract bleeding-related case fatality. RESULTS Mean participant age was 54 years (SD, 10 years), 44%were women, and 57%were European. Among the 359 166 individuals in the baseline cohort, 3976 had a major bleeding event during 1 281 896 person-years of follow-up. Most had gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding (n=2910 [73%]). There were 274 fatal bleeding events (7%), of which 153 were intracerebral. The risk of a nonfatal GI bleeding event per 1000 person-years was 2.19 (95%CI, 2.11-2.27), 1.77 (95%CI, 1.69-1.85) and 1.61 (95%CI, 1.52-1.69), in the baseline, non-high-risk, and nonmedication cohorts, respectively. Case fatality associated with GI bleeding was 3.4% (95%CI, 2.2%-4.1%), 4.0% (95%CI, 3.2%-5.1%), and 4.6%(95%CI, 3.6%-6.0%) in the baseline, non-high-risk, and nonmedication cohorts, respectively. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In a population not receiving antiplatelet therapy, the annual risk of major bleeding events and nonfatal major bleeding was estimated.

Both antibody and T-cell responses against immunodominant GAS virulence factors, including M protein, cross-react with host tissue proteins, triggering an inflammatory response leading to permanent heart damage. However, in some ARF/RHD-endemic regions, throat carriage of GAS is low. Because Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis organisms, also known as β-hemolytic group C streptococci and group G streptococci (GGS), also express M protein, we postulated that streptococci other than GAS may have the potential to initiate or exacerbate ARF/RHD. Using a model initially developed to investigate the uniquely human disease of ARF/RHD, we have discovered that GGS causes interleukin 17A/interferon 3-induced myocarditis and valvulitis, hallmarks of ARF/RHD. Remarkably the histological, immunological, and functional changes in the hearts of rats exposed to GGS are identical to those exposed to GAS.

The purpose of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence of these health co-benefits to improve our understanding of the mitigation measures involved, potential mechanisms, and relevant uncertainties. Methods: A comprehensive search for peer-reviewed studies published in English was conducted using the primary electronic databases. Reference lists from these articles were reviewed and manual searches were performed to supplement relevant studies. The identified records were screened based on inclusion criteria. We extracted data from the final retrieved papers using a pre-designed data extraction form and a quality assessment was conducted. The studies were heterogeneities, so meta-analysis was not possible and instead evidence was synthesized using narrative summaries. Results: Thirty-six studies were identified. We identified GHG mitigation strategies in five domains – energy generation, transportation, food and agriculture, households, and industry and economy – which usually, although not always, bring co-benefits for public health. These health gains are likely to be multiplied by comprehensive measures that include more than one sectors. Conclusions: GHG mitigation strategies can bring about substantial and possibly cost-effective public health co-benefits. These findings are highly relevant to policy makers and other stakeholders since they point to the compounding value of taking concerted action against climate change and air pollution. ? 2018",Air pollution; Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Health co-benefits; Mitigation; Uncertainty,Air pollution; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public health; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Health co-benefits; Mitigation; Mitigation measures; Mitigation strategy; Potential mechanism; Uncertainty; Climate change; atmospheric pollution; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; health impact; heterogeneity; literature review; public health; uncertainty analysis; agriculture; air pollution; climate change; cost effectiveness analysis; economic aspect; follow up; food; greenhouse gas; household; human; industry; limit of quantitation; nonhuman; particulate matter; peer review; priority journal; public health; quality control; Review; systematic review; analysis; climate change; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; prevention and control; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollution; Climate Change; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Public Health,2-s2.0-85041456171

Semi-structured interviews involve clinical judgement, whereas fully structured interviews are completely scripted. The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), a brief fully structured interview, is also sometimes used. It is not known whether interview method is associated with probability of major depression classification. Aims: To evaluate the association between interview method and odds of major depression classification, controlling for depressive symptom scores and participant characteristics. Method: Data collected for an individual participant data meta-analysis of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) diagnostic accuracy were analysed and binomial generalised linear mixed models were fit. Results: A total of 17 158 participants (2287 with major depression) from 57 primary studies were analysed. Among fully structured interviews, odds of major depression were higher for the MINI compared with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI) (odds ratio (OR) = 2.10; 95% CI = 1.15-3.87). Compared with semi-structured interviews, fully structured interviews (MINI excluded) were non-significantly more likely to classify participants with low-level depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores ?6) as having major depression (OR = 3.13; 95% CI = 0.98-10.00), similarly likely for moderate-level symptoms (PHQ-9 scores 7-15) (OR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.56-1.66) and significantly less likely for high-level symptoms (PHQ-9 scores ?16) (OR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.26-0.97). Conclusions: The MINI may identify more people as depressed than the CIDI, and semi-structured and fully structured interviews may not be interchangeable methods, but these results should be replicated.

of mean and shape of blood pressure distribution to worldwide trends and variations in raised blood pressure: A pooled analysis of 1018 population-based measurement studies with 88.6 million participants,2018,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050702158&doi=10.1093%2fije%2fdyy016&partnerID=40&md5=a91bc1e3360052f9be6da75b1f479357,"Background: Change in the prevalence of raised blood pressure could be due to both shifts in the entire distribution of blood pressure (representing the combined effects of public health interventions and secular trends) and changes in its high-blood-pressure tail (representing successful clinical interventions to control blood pressure in the hypertensive population). Our aim was to quantify the contributions of these two phenomena to the worldwide trends in the prevalence of raised blood pressure. Methods: We pooled 1018 population-based studies with blood pressure measurements on 88.6 million participants from 1985 to 2016. We first calculated mean systolic blood pressure (SBP), mean diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and prevalence of raised blood pressure by sex and 10-year age group from 20-29 years to 70-79 years in each study, taking into account complex survey design and survey sample weights, where relevant. We used a linear mixed effect model to quantify the association between (probittransformed) prevalence of raised blood pressure and age-group- and sex-specific mean blood pressure. We calculated the contributions of change in mean SBP and DBP, and of change in the prevalence-mean association, to the change in prevalence of raised blood pressure. Results: In 2005-16, at the same level of population mean SBP and DBP, men and women in South Asia and in Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa would have the highest prevalence of raised blood pressure, and men and women in the highincome Asia Pacific and high-income Western regions would have the lowest. In most region-sex-age groups where the prevalence of raised blood pressure declined, one half or more of the decline was due to the decline in mean blood pressure. Where prevalence of raised blood pressure has increased, the change was entirely driven by increasing mean blood pressure, offset partly by the change in the prevalence-mean association. Conclusions: Change in mean blood pressure is the main driver of the worldwide change in the prevalence of raised blood pressure, but change in the high-blood-pressure tail of the distribution has also contributed to the change in prevalence, especially in older age groups. ?

The recommendations have been approved by WHO and the membership of WFSA. These Standards are applicable to all anesthesia providers throughout the world. They are intended to provide guidance and assistance to anesthesia providers, their professional organizations, hospital and facility administrators, and governments for maintaining and improving the quality and safety of anesthesia care. The Standards cover professional aspects; facilities and equipment; medications and intravenous fluids; monitoring; and the conduct of anesthesia. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED standards, the functional equivalent of mandatory standards, include (amongst other things): the continuous presence of a trained and vigilant anesthesia provider; continuous monitoring of tissue oxygenation and perfusion by clinical observation and a pulse oximeter; intermittent monitoring of blood pressure; confirmation of correct placement of an endotracheal tube (if used) by auscultation and carbon dioxide detection; the use of the WHO Safe Surgery Checklist; and a system for transfer of care at the end of an anesthetic. The International Standards represent minimum standards and the goal should always be to practice to the highest possible standards, preferably exceeding the standards outlined in this document.

In a post-hoc analysis of 10,054 screening participants from the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) we show that the risk of lung cancer, according to the PLCOm2012 model, is closely related to the likelihood of having chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Those at greatest risk for lung cancer have the highest prevalence of COPD and greater likelihood of dying of a non-lung cancer cause. This ""competing cause of death"" effect occurs because smokers eligible for lung cancer screening have a high prevalence of comorbid disease and greater likelihood of dying from cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease or other cancers. This means high risk smokers at greatest risk of lung cancer may not necessarily benefit from screening due to greater inoperability and premature death. In this analysis we show that the benefit of annual computed tomography (CT) screening is greatest in those with normal lung function or only mild-to-moderate COPD. We found no mortality benefit in those with severe or very severe COPD (GOLD 3-4). We also show that the efficiency of screening, based on optimizing the number of lung cancer deaths averted per 1,000 persons screened, is best achieved by screening those at intermediate risk. By combining clinical risk variables with a gene-based risk score, even greater reductions in lung cancer mortality can be achieved with CT. We suggest a biomarker-led outcomes-based approach may help to better define which eligible smokers might defer screening (low risk of lung cancer), discontinue screening (high risk of overtreatment with little benefit) or continue screening to achieve the greatest reduction in lung cancer mortality. ?

GABA type A receptors (GABA A Rs) are severely affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the distribution and subunit composition of GABA A Rs in the AD brain are not well understood. This is the first comprehensive study to show brain region- and cell layer-specific alterations in the expression of the GABA A R subunits α1-3, α5, β1-3 and γ2 in the human AD hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and superior temporal gyrus. In late-stage AD tissue samples using immunohistochemistry we found significant alteration of all investigated GABA A Rs subunits except for α3 and β1 that were well preserved. The most prominent changes include an increase in GABA A R α1 expression associated with AD in all layers of the CA3 region, in the stratum (str.) granulare and hilus of the dentate gyrus. We found a significant increase in GABA A R α2 expression in the str. oriens of the CA1-3, str. radiatum of the CA2,3 and decrease in the str. pyramidale of the CA1 region in AD cases. In AD there was a significant increase in GABA A R α5 subunit expression in str. pyramidale, str. oriens of the CA1 region and decrease in the superior temporal gyrus. We also found a significant decrease in the GABA A R β3 subunit immunoreactivity in the str. oriens of the CA2, str. granulare and str. moleculare of the dentate gyrus. In conclusion, these findings indicate that the expression of the GABA A R subunits shows brain region- and layer-specific alterations in AD, and these changes could significantly influence and alter GABA A R function in the disease.

It is commonly assumed that colonic motility becomes quiescent after surgery, but this hypothesis has not been evaluated rigorously. This study quantified colonic motility through the early postoperative period using high-resolution colonic manometry. Methods: Fibre-optic colonic manometry was performed continuously before, during and after surgery in the left colon and rectum of patients undergoing right hemicolectomy, and in healthy controls. Motor events were characterized by pattern, frequency, direction, velocity, amplitude and distance propagated. Results: Eight patients undergoing hemicolectomy and nine healthy controls were included in the study. Colonic motility became markedly hyperactive in all operated patients, consistently dominated by cyclic motor patterns. Onset of cyclic motor patterns began to a minor extent before operation, occurring with increasing intensity nearer the time of surgery; the mean(s.d.) active duration was 12(7) per cent over 3 h before operation and 43(17) per cent within 1 h before surgery (P = 0.024); in fasted controls it was 2(4) per cent (P < 0·001). After surgery, cyclic motor patterns increased markedly in extent and intensity, becoming nearly continuous (active duration 94(13) per cent; P < 0·001), with peak frequency 2–4 cycles per min in the sigmoid colon. This postoperative cyclic pattern was substantially more prominent than in non-operative controls, including in the fed state (active duration 27(20) per cent; P < 0·001), and also showed higher antegrade velocity (P < 0·001). Conclusion: Distal gut motility becomes markedly hyperactive with colonic surgery, dominated by cyclic motor patterns. This hyperactivity likely represents a novel pathophysiological aspect of the surgical stress response. Hyperactive motility may contribute to gut dysfunction after surgery, potentially offering a new therapeutic target to enhance recovery. ? 2018 BJS Society Ltd Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"adolescent; adult; aged; colon; colon resection; elective surgery; female; fiber optics; gastrointestinal motility; human; ileus; male; manometry; middle aged; pathophysiology; periodicity; physiological stress; postoperative complication; procedures; surgery; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Colectomy; Colon; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Fiber Optic Technology; Gastrointestinal Motility; Humans; Ileus; Male; Manometry; Middle Aged; Periodicity; Postoperative Complications; Stress, Physiological; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85045387068

Studies in HD mouse models have shown that artificial miRNAs can reduce mutant HTT, but evidence for their effectiveness and safety in larger animals is lacking. HD transgenic sheep express the full-length human HTT with 73 CAG repeats. AAV9 was used to deliver unilaterally to HD sheep striatum an artificial miRNA targeting exon 48 of the human HTT mRNA under control of two alternative promoters: U6 or CβA. The treatment reduced human mutant (m) HTT mRNA and protein 50-80% in the striatum at 1 and 6 months post injection. Silencing was detectable in both the caudate and putamen. Levels of endogenous sheep HTT protein were not affected. There was no significant loss of neurons labeled by DARPP32 or NeuN at 6 months after treatment, and Iba1-positive microglia were detected at control levels. It is concluded that safe and effective silencing of human mHTT protein can be achieved and sustained in a large-animal brain by direct delivery of an AAV carrying an artificial miRNA. ?

The medical community continues to debate the optimal technique for emergency front-of-neck airway management. Although individual clinicians infrequently perform this procedure, hundreds are performed annually worldwide. Ubiquitous smartphone technology and internet connectivity have created the opportunity to collect these data. We created the ‘Airway App’, a smartphone application to capture the experiences of healthcare providers involved in emergency front-of-neck airway procedures. In the first 18-month period, 104 emergency front-of-neck airway management reports were received; 99 (95%) were internally valid and unique from 21 countries. Eighty-one (82%) were performed by non-surgeons and 63 (64%) were ‘cannot intubate, cannot oxygenate’ emergencies. Overall first-attempt success varied by technique; 45 scalpel–bougie cricothyroidotomy (37 first-attempt success), 25 surgical cricothyroidotomy (15 first-attempt success), eight cannula cricothyroidotomy (five first-attempt success), six wire-guided cricothyroidotomy (three first-attempt success) and 15 tracheostomy reports (11 first-attempt success). The most commonly reported positive human factors were good communication, good teamwork and/or skilled personnel. The most commonly reported negative human factors were fixation on multiple tracheal intubation attempts, delay in initiating emergency front-of-neck airway and/or the failure to plan for failure. Due to the anonymous nature of reporting, reports are open to recollection bias and spurious reporting. We conclude collection of data using a smartphone application is feasible and has the potential to expand our knowledge of emergency front-of-neck airway management. ? 2018 The Association of Anaesthetists of Great Britain and Ireland","airway assessment, co-existing disease; CICO; difficult airway algorithm; emergency airway; failed intubation, treatment","neuromuscular blocking agent; airway; Airway App; airway obstruction; anaphylaxis; Article; cannulation; controlled study; critical illness; emergency care; emergency front of neck airway procedure; emergency treatment; endotracheal intubation; face injury; feasibility study; foreign body; head and neck infection; health care personnel; heart arrest; human; internal validity; major clinical study; medical technology; mobile application; multicenter study; neck injury; observational study; physician; respiration control; respiratory arrest; retrospective study; risk factor; surgical technique; teamwork; tracheostomy; tracheotomy; adult; aged; clinical competence; cricoid cartilage; emergency health service; female; information processing; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; neck; patient care; pregnancy; procedures; questionnaire; smartphone; statistics and numerical data; surgery; tracheostomy; tracheotomy; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Airway Management; Clinical Competence; Communication; Cricoid Cartilage; Data Collection; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Humans; Intubation, Intratracheal; Male; Middle Aged; Mobile Applications; Neck; Patient Care Team; Pregnancy; Retrospective Studies; Smartphone; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tracheostomy; Tracheotomy",2-s2.0-85043490150

Methods and Materials: The BIG 02-98 trial randomized patients to receive adjuvant anthracycline with or without taxane chemotherapy. Delivery of PMRT was nonrandomized and performed according to institutional preferences. The present analysis was performed on participants with T1-T2 breast cancer and 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes who had undergone mastectomy and axillary nodal dissection. The primary objective of the present study was to examine the effect of PMRT on risk of locoregional recurrence (LRR), breast cancer–specific survival, and overall survival. Results: We identified 684 patients who met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis, of whom 337 (49%) had received PMRT. At 10 years, LRR risk was 2.5% in the PMRT group and 6.5% in the no-PMRT group (hazard ratio 0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.12-0.73; P =.005). Lower LRR after PMRT was noted for patients randomized to receive adjuvant chemotherapy with no taxane (10-year LRR: 3.4% vs 9.1%; P =.02). No significant differences in breast cancer–specific survival (84.3% vs 83.9%) or overall survival (81.7% vs 78.3%) were observed according to receipt of PMRT. Conclusion: Our analysis of the BIG 02-98 trial shows excellent outcomes in women with T1-T2 tumors and 1 to 3 positive lymph nodes found in axillary dissection. Although PMRT improved LRR in this cohort, the number of events remained low at 10 years. In all groups, 10-year rates of LRR were relatively low compared with historical studies. As such, the use of PMRT in women with 1 to 3 positive nodes should be tailored to individual patient risks. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,"Body fluids; Chemotherapy; Diseases; Dissection; Tumors; Adjuvant chemotherapy; Breast international groups; Confidence interval; Locoregional recurrence; Methods and materials; Positive lymph nodes; Postmastectomy radiation therapies; Primary objective; Radiotherapy; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; doxorubicin; anthracycline; antineoplastic agent; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; doxorubicin; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cancer surgery; controlled study; female; human; lymph node; major clinical study; mastectomy; multimodality cancer therapy; overall survival; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; adjuvant chemotherapy; axilla; breast tumor; cancer staging; clinical trial; confidence interval; lymph node; lymph node dissection; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; Paget nipple disease; partial mastectomy; pathology; phase 3 clinical trial; postoperative care; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anthracyclines; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Axilla; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Confidence Intervals; Cyclophosphamide; Docetaxel; Doxorubicin; Female; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes; Mastectomy; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Postoperative Care; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85043274745

Methods: A cohort study was undertaken using health records of children aged 3–12 years attending an oral health service for the first time. Subjects were then linked to hospital diagnoses of scabies and ARF or CRHD. Results: A total of 213 957 children free of rheumatic heart disease at baseline were available for analysis. During a mean follow-up time of 5.1 years, 440 children were diagnosed with ARF or CRHD in hospital records. Children diagnosed with scabies during follow-up were 23 times more likely to develop ARF or CRHD, compared with children who had no scabies diagnosis. After adjustment for confounders in a Cox model, the association reduced but remained strong (adjusted hazard ratio: 8.98; 95% confidence interval: 6.33–20.2). In an analysis restricted to children hospitalised at least once during follow-up, the adjusted hazard ratio for the same comparison was 3.43 (95% confidence interval: 1.85–6.37). Conclusions: A recent diagnosis of scabies from hospital records is strongly associated with a subsequent diagnosis of ARF. Further investigation of the role that scabies infestation may play in the aetiology of ARF is warranted. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",cohort studies; epidemiology; rheumatic fever; scabies,"abscess; Article; asthma; bronchiolitis; cellulitis; child; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; deciduous tooth; dental caries; dermatitis; disease association; female; follow up; hospital admission; human; impetigo; incidence; major clinical study; male; medical record; morbidity; New Zealand; permanent tooth; pneumonia; preschool child; rheumatic fever; rheumatic heart disease; scabies; school child; sensitivity analysis; complication; proportional hazards model; rheumatic fever; scabies; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Dental Records; Female; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Proportional Hazards Models; Rheumatic Fever; Scabies",2-s2.0-85042087362

Policies can have effects on a myriad of outcomes and stakeholders differ in the outcomes they consider and value, while relevant knowledge on policy effects is dispersed across multiple research disciplines making integrated judgements difficult. Methods: Experts on drug harms, addiction, criminology and drug policy were invited to a decision conference to develop a multi-criterion decision analysis (MCDA) model for appraising alternative regulatory regimes. Participants collectively defined regulatory regimes and identified outcome criteria reflecting ethical and normative concerns. For cannabis and alcohol separately, participants evaluated each regulatory regime on each criterion and weighted the criteria to provide summary scores for comparing different regimes. Results: Four generic regulatory regimes were defined: absolute prohibition, decriminalisation, state control and free market. Participants also identified 27 relevant criteria which were organised into seven thematically related clusters. State control was the preferred regime for both alcohol and cannabis. The ranking of the regimes was robust to variations in the criterion-specific weights. Conclusion: The MCDA process allowed the participants to deconstruct complex drug policy issues into a set of simpler judgements that led to consensus about the results. ? 2018 The Authors",Alcohol; Cannabis; Drug policy; Multi-criterion decision analysis,"absolute prohibition; alcohol regulation; analytical research; Article; cannabis regulation; consensus development; decision making; decriminalization; drug legislation; free market; health care policy; human; legal aspect; medical ethics; multi criterion decision analysis; priority journal; state control; thematic analysis; cannabis use; consensus; decision support system; drinking behavior; drug control; health care delivery; public policy; cannabis; Alcohol Drinking; Cannabis; Consensus; Decision Support Techniques; Delivery of Health Care; Drug and Narcotic Control; Humans; Legislation, Drug; Marijuana Use; Public Policy",2-s2.0-85042060303

The utility of any of these in a particular setting depends on preexisting clinician accuracy. We therefore assess the accuracy of clinician practice in detecting clinically important traumatic brain injury. Methods: This was a planned secondary analysis of a prospective observational study of children younger than 18 years with head injuries at 10 Australian and New Zealand centers. In a cohort of children with mild head injuries (Glasgow Coma Scale score 13 to 15, presenting in <24 hours) we assessed physician accuracy (computed tomography [CT] obtained in emergency departments [EDs]) for the standardized outcome of clinically important traumatic brain injury and compared this with the accuracy of PECARN, CATCH, and CHALICE. Results: Of 20,137 children, 18,913 had a mild head injury. Of these patients, 1,579 (8.3%) received a CT scan during the ED visit, 160 (0.8%) had clinically important traumatic brain injury, and 24 (0.1%) underwent neurosurgery. Clinician identification of clinically important traumatic brain injury based on CT performed had a sensitivity of 158 of 160, or 98.8% (95% confidence interval [CI] 95.6% to 99.8%) and a specificity of 17,332 of 18,753, or 92.4% (95% CI 92.0% to 92.8%). Sensitivity of PECARN for children younger than 2 years was 42 of 42 (100.0%; 95% CI 91.6% to 100.0%), and for those 2 years and older, it was 117 of 118 (99.2%; 95% CI 95.4% to 100.0%); for CATCH (high/medium risk), it was 147 of 160 (91.9%; 95% CI 86.5% to 95.6%); and for CHALICE, 148 of 160 (92.5%; 95% CI 87.3% to 96.1%). Conclusion: In a setting with high clinician accuracy and a low CT rate, PECARN, CATCH, or CHALICE clinical decision rules have limited potential to increase the accuracy of detecting clinically important traumatic brain injury and may increase the CT rate. ? 2018 American College of Emergency Physicians",,"age; Article; child; childhood injury; clinical decision support system; clinical practice; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; emergency ward; female; human; major clinical study; male; neurosurgery; physician; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; secondary analysis; sensitivity and specificity; traumatic brain injury; Australia; clinical decision making; clinical trial; decision support system; diagnostic imaging; health service; hospital emergency service; multicenter study; New Zealand; traumatic brain injury; x-ray computed tomography; Australia; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Decision-Making; Decision Support Techniques; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Male; Medical Overuse; New Zealand; Prospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85041931288

Methods: We used cross-sectional near whole population-level data on 318 321 four-year-olds attending the “B4 School check,” a national health and development check in New Zealand, across 6 fiscal years (2010/2011 to 2015/2016). The “lift the lip” screening tool was used to estimate experience of any caries and severe caries. We investigated deprivation gradients using the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD), which measures seven domains of deprivation across 5958 geographical areas (“data zones”). Ethnicity was categorized into five groups: (i) M?ori, (ii) Pacific, (iii) Asian, (iv) Middle Eastern, Latin American and African (MELAA) and (v) European & Other (combined). We used a random intercepts model to estimate mutually adjusted associations between deprivation, ethnicity, age, fiscal year, and evidence of any dental caries experience. Results: Reports of any caries experience decreased from 15.8% (95% CI: 15.7; 15.9%) to 14.7% 95% CI: 14.4; 14.8%), while reports of severe caries experience increased from 3.0% (95% CI: 3.0; 3.1%) to 4.4% (95% CI: 4.3; 4.5%) from 2010/2011 to 2015/2016. This varied by ethnicity with larger increases in severe caries for Pacific children from 7.1% (95% CI: 6.8; 7.4%) to 14.1% (95% CI: 13.7; 14.5%). There were deprivation gradients in dental caries experience with considerable variation by ethnicity and by domain of deprivation. The association between deprivation and dental caries experience was weakest for Asian children and was most pronounced for Pacific and M?ori children.

Although theory and research tend to reflect an implicit assumption that suppression and expression represent opposite sides of the same construct, they are likely to occur independently and exert different influences on intrapersonal and interpersonal experiences. In 4 experience-sampling and longitudinal studies, we assessed the personal and interpersonal consequences of daily emotional suppression and expression within romantic and close relationships. Mixed-model analyses revealed that suppression and expression consistently predicted independent and distinct outcomes across the studies. When individuals suppressed their emotions, they experienced more intrapersonal costs such as greater depressed mood, greater fatigue, lower self-esteem, and lower life satisfaction. Interpersonally, they also felt less acceptance from others, more distancing by others, and less relationship satisfaction. Greater suppression in daily life also predicted increases in depressive symptoms and reductions in relationship satisfaction 3 months later. In contrast, when individuals were more emotionally expressive during daily interactions, they experienced interpersonal benefits such as greater acceptance from others, greater relatedness and relationship satisfaction, and less distancing by others. Greater emotional expression in daily life also predicted increases in self-esteem and relationship satisfaction across time. Meta-analyses of the 4 studies confirmed the reliability and significance of these relationships; |r's| = .12-.33. These studies demonstrate that suppression and expression are distinct processes used to manage emotions within social relationships and operate differently in shaping personal well-being and relationship functioning. ? 2017 American Psychological Association.",Emotion regulation; Emotional expression; Emotional suppression; Experience sampling; Interpersonal relationships,adult; approach social goal; Article; controlled study; depression; emotional expression; emotional suppression; emotionality; fatigue; female; health care cost; human; human experiment; human relation; life satisfaction; longitudinal study; male; prediction; self esteem; social avoidance behavior; wellbeing; emotion; human relation; meta analysis; middle aged; physiology; young adult; Adult; Emotions; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85021700717

To predict and prevent new invasions, it is crucial to develop a better understanding of the drivers of the invasion process. The analysis of 4,533 border interception events revealed that at least 51 different alien ant species were intercepted at US ports over a period of 70 years (1914–1984), and 45 alien species were intercepted entering New Zealand over a period of 68 years (1955–2013). Most of the interceptions did not originate from species’ native ranges but instead came from invaded areas. In the United States, 75.7% of the interceptions came from a country where the intercepted ant species had been previously introduced. In New Zealand, this value was even higher, at 87.8%. There was an overrepresentation of interceptions from nearby locations (Latin America for species intercepted in the United States and Oceania for species intercepted in New Zealand). The probability of a species’ successful establishment in both the United States and New Zealand was positively related to the number of interceptions of the species in these countries. Moreover, species that have spread to more continents are also more likely to be intercepted and to make secondary introductions. This creates a positive feedback loop between the introduction and establishment stages of the invasion process, in which initial establishments promote secondary introductions. Overall, these results reveal that secondary introductions act as a critical driver of increasing global rates of invasions. ? 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

It is characterised by irreversible dilatation of airways and is generally associated with airway inflammation and chronic bacterial infection. Medical management largely aims to reduce morbidity by controlling the symptoms, reduce exacerbation frequency, improve quality of life and prevent the progression of bronchiectasis. This is an update of a review first published in 2000. Objectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in children and adults with stable state bronchiectasis, specifically to assess whether the use of ICS: (1) reduces the severity and frequency of acute respiratory exacerbations; or (2) affects long-term pulmonary function decline. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cochrane Airways Group Register of trials, MEDLINE and Embase databases. We ran the latest literature search in June 2017. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ICS with a placebo or no medication. We included children and adults with clinical or radiographic evidence of bronchiectasis, but excluded people with cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis: We reviewed search results against predetermined criteria for inclusion. In this update, two independent review authors assessed methodological quality and risk of bias in trials using established criteria and extracted data using standard pro forma. We analysed treatment as 'treatment received' and performed sensitivity analyses. Main results: The review included seven studies, involving 380 adults. Of the 380 randomised participants, 348 completed the studies. Due to differences in outcomes reported among the seven studies, we could only perform limited meta-analysis for both the short-term ICS use (6 months or less) and the longer-term ICS use (&gt; 6 months). During stable state in the short-term group (ICS for 6 months or less), based on the two studies from which data could be included, there were no significant differences from baseline values in the forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) at the end of the study (mean difference (MD) -0.09, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.26 to 0.09) and forced vital capacity (FVC) (MD 0.01 L, 95% CI -0.16 to 0.17) in adults on ICS (compared to no ICS). Similarly, we did not find any significant difference in the average exacerbation frequency (MD 0.09, 95% CI -0.61 to 0.79) or health-related quality of life (HRQoL) total scores in adults on ICS when compared with no ICS, though data available were limited. Based on a single non-placebo controlled study from which we could not extract clinical data, there was marginal, though statistically significant improvement in sputum volume and dyspnoea scores on ICS. The single study on long-term outcomes (over 6 months) that examined lung function and other clinical outcomes, showed no significant effect of ICS on any of the outcomes. We could not draw any conclusion on adverse effects due to limited available data. Despite the authors of all seven studies stating they were double-blind, we judged one study (in the short duration ICS) as having a high risk of bias based on blinding, attrition and reporting of outcomes. The GRADE quality of evidence was low for all outcomes (due to non-placebo controlled trial, indirectness and imprecision with small numbers of participants and studies). Authors' conclusions: This updated review indicates that there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of ICS in adults with stable state bronchiectasis. Further, we cannot draw any conclusion for the use of ICS in adults during an acute exacerbation or in children (for any state), as there were no studies. ? 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"corticosteroid; androstane derivative; antiinfective agent; beclometasone; corticosteroid; fluticasone; adverse outcome; bronchiectasis; chronic obstructive lung disease; computer assisted tomography; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; dyspnea; effect size; eosinophilia; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; human; intention to treat analysis; lung function; population research; practice guideline; priority journal; quality of life; reliability; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk assessment; scoring system; sputum; systematic review; treatment outcome; adult; bronchiectasis; inhalational drug administration; lung function test; meta analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); vital capacity; Administration, Inhalation; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Androstadienes; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Beclomethasone; Bronchiectasis; Disease Progression; Fluticasone; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Respiratory Function Tests; Vital Capacity",2-s2.0-84891702089

However, the full potential of this drug has not been realised, in part due to low oral bioavailability and frequent dosing requirements. This study reports the synthesis, in-vitro, ex-vivo and in-vivo evaluation of trimethyl chitosan (TMC) - CSKSSDYQC (CSK) peptide conjugates capable of enhancing the oral bioavailability of gemcitabine due to the ability to target intestinal goblet cells and promote intestinal cellular uptake. TMC was synthesized by a novel two-step methylation method to improve quanternization and yield. The CSK-TMC conjugates were prepared by ionic gelation to achieve particles sized at 173.6 ± 6.8 nm, zeta potential of +18.5 ± 0.2 mV and entrapment efficiency of 66.4 ± 0.1%, capable of sustained drug release. By encapsulating gemcitabine into CSK-TMC conjugates, an increased amount of drug permeated through porcine intestinal epithelial membranes compared with the unconjugated TMC nanoparticles (NPs). The rate of cellular uptake of drug loaded conjugates into HT29-MTX-E12 intestinal goblet cells, was time- and concentration-dependant. The conjugates underwent active transport associated with adsorptive mediated, clathrin and caveolae mediated endocytosis. In cellular transport studies, drug loaded conjugates had greater drug transport capability compared with drug solution and TMC NPs over the co-cultured Caco-2/HT29-MTX-E12 cell monolayer. The drug loaded conjugates exhibited electrostatic interaction with the intestinal epithelial cells. Both P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and multiple resistance protein-2 (MRP2) efflux affected the cellular transport of the conjugates. Importantly, during the pharmacokinetic studies, the orally administrated drug loaded into TMC NPs showed an improved oral bioavailability of 54.0%, compared with gemcitabine solution of 9.9%. Notable, the CSK-TMC conjugates further improved oral bioavailability to 60.1% and reduced the tumour growth rate in a BALB/c nude mouse model, with a 5.1-fold and 3.3-fold reduction compare with the non-treated group and gemcitabine solution group. Furthermore, no major evidence of toxicity was discernible on histologic studies of selected organs. In conclusion, the presented CSK-TMC conjugates and TMC nanoparticles both significantly improve the oral bioavailability of gemcitabine and have the potential for the treatment of breast cancer. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Anticancer; Drug polymer conjugates; Gemcitabine; N-trimethyl chitosan; Oral bioavailability; Sustained release,"Alkylation; Biochemistry; Cells; Chitosan; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Diseases; Frequency shift keying; Gelation; Glycoproteins; Multilayers; Nanoparticles; Peptides; Targeted drug delivery; Anticancer; Gemcitabine; N-trimethyl chitosans; Oral bioavailabilities; Polymer conjugate; Sustained release; Drug products; ABC transporter subfamily B; chitosan nanoparticle; gemcitabine; multidrug resistance associated protein 2; n trimethyl chitosan; peptide; unclassified drug; antineoplastic antimetabolite; chitosan; deoxycytidine; gemcitabine; N-trimethyl chitosan chloride; nanoparticle; peptide fragment; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; area under the curve; Article; breast cancer; Caco-2 cell line; cancer inhibition; cell transport; conjugation; controlled study; drug bioavailability; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug half life; drug penetration; drug solution; drug transport; drug uptake; ex vivo study; goblet cell; histology; HT-29-MTX cell line; in vitro study; in vivo study; intestine epithelium; intestine epithelium cell; LD50; male; maximum plasma concentration; mouse; nanopharmaceutics; nonhuman; particle size; pig; priority journal; static electricity; sustained drug release; time to maximum plasma concentration; tumor volume; zeta potential; analogs and derivatives; animal; Bagg albino mouse; bioavailability; breast tumor; cell survival; drug effect; female; HT-29 cell line; human; metabolism; nude mouse; oral drug administration; physiology; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; treatment outcome; Administration, Oral; Animals; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Biological Availability; Breast Neoplasms; Caco-2 Cells; Cell Survival; Chitosan; Deoxycytidine; Female; HT29 Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Nanoparticles; Peptide Fragments; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Swine; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85044137382

They are immunogenic and initially assessed largely by their ability to induce serum bactericidal activity. Measures of efficacy indicate good protection against homologous strains in older children and adults. Effectiveness appears broader than predicted by immunogenicity and efficacy studies. The recent discovery that meningococcal group B OMVs may protect against the related Neisseria species N.gonorrhoeae suggests more to these interesting antigen collections than meets the eye. Currently there are two OMV-containing group B vaccines available, the new recombinant protein-based Bexsero? developed by Novartis and VA-MENGOC-BC? developed by the Finlay institute in Cuba. Also, a third group B vaccine based on two recombinant factor H binding proteins (Trumenba?, Pfizer), has recently been licenced but it does not include OMV. This commentary explores the population impact that group B OMV vaccines have had on meningococcal and gonorrhoea diseases. Given the heterologous effect against diverse strains of the meningococcus observed in older children and adults, and recent evidence to suggest moderate protection against gonorrhoea, there may be a role for these vaccines in programmes targeting adolescents and groups high at risk for both meningococcal disease and gonorrhoea. ? 2018 Taylor & Francis.","gonorrhoea, MeNZB; meningococcal group B; OMV; outer membrane vesicle vaccine","Meningococcus vaccine; 4CMenB vaccine; bacterial antigen; Meningococcus vaccine; outer membrane protein; recombinant protein; clinical effectiveness; Cuba; drug research; drug surveillance program; gonorrhea; health impact assessment; human; immunization; immunogenicity; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; New Zealand; nonhuman; Norway; Note; population distribution; treatment response; Brazil; cross protection; genetics; gonorrhea; immunology; incidence; meningococcosis; microbiology; Neisseria meningitidis; treatment outcome; vaccine immunogenicity; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Brazil; Cross Protection; Cuba; Gonorrhea; Humans; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Incidence; Meningococcal Infections; Meningococcal Vaccines; Neisseria gonorrhoeae; Neisseria meningitidis, Serogroup B; New Zealand; Recombinant Proteins; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85034264000

No studies have prospectively examined the influence of ACL injury and reconstruction on lower-extremity muscle volumes. Objective: Assess magnetic resonance imaging-derived lower-extremity muscle volumes, and quantify quadriceps strength and activation in patients following ACL injury and reconstruction. Design: Prospective case series. Setting: Research laboratory and magnetic resonance imaging facility. Patients (or Other Participants): Four patients (2 men and 2 women; age = 27.4 (7.4) y, height = 169.2 (8.1) cm, and mass = 74.3 (18.5) kg) scheduled for ACL-R. Intervention(s): Thirty-five muscle volumes were obtained from a bilateral lower-extremity magnetic resonance imaging before and after ACL-R. Main Outcome Measures: Muscle volumes expressed relative to (1) a normative database presurgery and postsurgery, (2) limb symmetry presurgery and postsurgery, and (3) percentage change presurgery to postsurgery. Quadriceps function was quantified by normalized knee extension maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque and central activation ratio. Results: Involved vastus lateralis and tibialis anterior were consistently smaller than healthy individuals (z < -1 SD) presurgery and postsurgery in all patients. Involved rectus femoris and vastus lateralis were more than 15% smaller than the contralateral limb presurgery, whereas the involved rectus femoris, gracilis, vastus medialis, vastus intermedius, and vastus lateralis muscle volumes exceeded 20% asymmetry postoperatively. Involved gracilis and semitendinosus atrophied more than 30% from presurgery to postsurgery. Involved maximal voluntary isometric contraction torque and central activation ratio increased by 12.7% and 12.5%, respectively, yet strength remained 33.2% asymmetric postsurgery. Conclusions: Adaptations in lower-extremity muscle volumes are present following ACL injury and reconstruction. Anterior thigh and shank muscles were smaller than healthy individuals, and large asymmetries in quadriceps volumes were observed presurgery and postsurgery. Selective atrophy of the semitendinosus and gracilis occurred following surgery.

Acute gouty inflammation is triggered by monosodium urate (MSU) crystal deposition in and around joints that activates macrophages into a proinflammatory state, resulting in neutrophil recruitment. A complete understanding of how MSU crystals activate macrophages in vivo has been difficult because of limitations of live imaging this process in traditional animal models. By live imaging the macrophage and neutrophil response to MSU crystals within an intact host (larval zebrafish), we reveal that macrophage activation requires mitochondrial ROS (mROS) generated through fatty acid oxidation. This mitochondrial source of ROS contributes to NF-κB-driven production of IL-1β and TNF-α, which promote neutrophil recruitment. We demonstrate the therapeutic utility of this discovery by showing that this mechanism is conserved in human macrophages and, via pharmacologic blockade, that it contributes to neutrophil recruitment in a mouse model of acute gouty inflammation. To our knowledge, this study is the first to uncover an immunometabolic mechanism of macrophage activation that operates during acute gouty inflammation. Targeting this pathway holds promise in the management of gout and, potentially, other macrophage-driven diseases. ? 2018 Academic Press.

Diminished glucose uptake due to impaired insulin signaling and decreased expression of glucose transporters is associated with a shift towards increased reliance on fatty acid oxidation and reduced cardiac efficiency in diabetic hearts. The cardiac metabolic profile in diabetes is influenced by disturbances in circulating glucose, insulin and fatty acids, and alterations in cardiomyocyte signaling. In this review, we focus on recent preclinical advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy. Genetic manipulation of cardiomyocyte insulin signaling intermediates has demonstrated that partial cardiac functional rescue can be achieved by upregulation of the insulin signaling pathway in diabetic hearts. Inconsistent findings have been reported relating to the role of cardiac AMPK and β-adrenergic signaling in diabetes, and systemic administration of agents targeting these pathways appear to elicit some cardiac benefit, but whether these effects are related to direct cardiac actions is uncertain. Overload of cardiomyocyte fuel storage is evident in the diabetic heart, with accumulation of glycogen and lipid droplets. Cardiac metabolic dysregulation in diabetes has been linked with oxidative stress and autophagy disturbance, which may lead to cell death induction, fibrotic ‘backfill’ and cardiac dysfunction. This review examines the weight of evidence relating to the molecular mechanisms of diabetic cardiomyopathy, with a particular focus on metabolic and signaling pathways. Areas of uncertainty in the field are highlighted and important knowledge gaps for further investigation are identified.

The basis for this has been the finding of central nervous system changes in glaucoma patients on histology and neuroimaging. It is known that retinal ganglion cell pathology of any cause leads to anterograde and retrograde retinal ganglion cell degeneration, as well as trans-synaptic (transneuronal) anterograde degeneration. Trans-synaptic degeneration has been demonstrated in a range of optic neuropathies including optic nerve transection, optic neuritis, and hereditary optic neuropathies. More recently, similar changes have been confirmed in glaucoma patients using the neuroimaging techniques of voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging. Some studies have reported brain changes in glaucoma outside the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway; however, these are preliminary and exploratory in nature. Further research is required to identify whether the degenerative brain changes in glaucoma are entirely secondary to the optic neuropathy or whether there is additional primary central nervous system pathology. This has critical implications for neuroprotective and regenerative treatment strategies and our basic understanding of glaucoma. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",glaucoma; neurodegeneration; neuroimaging; neuroprotection; trans-synaptic; transneuronal,brain disease; brain region; diffusion tensor imaging; disease association; glaucoma; histology; human; intraocular pressure; nerve regeneration; neuroimaging; neuroprotection; nonhuman; optic nerve disease; priority journal; retrograde degeneration; Review; transneuronal degeneration; visual system; voxel based morphometry; brain; degenerative disease; glaucoma; neuroprotection; pathology; physiology; retina ganglion cell; synapse; neuroprotective agent; Brain; Glaucoma; Humans; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Neuroprotection; Neuroprotective Agents; Retinal Ganglion Cells; Synapses; Visual Pathways,2-s2.0-85032910599

Ethnic disparities in obesity rates exist in NZ with M?ori and Pacific people having three to five times higher rates than all other ethnic groups within NZ. Ethnic disparities in rates of bariatric surgery have been reported internationally. This research sought to describe rates of publically funded bariatric surgery by self-identified ethnicity in NZ. Methods: Using reported census and hospitalization discharge data from Statistics NZ and the NZ Ministry of Health, we calculated estimate rates of publicly funded bariatric surgery in the morbidly obese population from June 2009 to July 2014. Results: The average number of publicly funded bariatric procedures performed per 1000 morbidly obese patients from June 2009 to July 2014 was 3.0 for European, 1.4 for M?ori and 0.7 for Pacific ethnicities. Conclusion: While these data should be interpreted cautiously due to data limitations, the estimated rates may indicate that bariatric services are currently being provided inequitably across the major ethnic groups within NZ. We suggest that further studies should be performed to explore potential patient, healthcare provider and system-level factors that may contribute to ethnic disparities in the rates of publicly funded bariatric surgery in NZ. ? 2017 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons",bariatric surgery; equity; ethnicity,"bariatric surgery; Caucasian; ethnology; female; health care disparity; human; male; morbid obesity; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; Bariatric Surgery; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Obesity, Morbid; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Procedures and Techniques Utilization; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85031495306

The modulatory effects of these neurotransmitters might explain how antipsychotics attenuate symptoms of schizophrenia and account for the variable response to antipsychotics observed in clinical practice. Based on the putative mechanisms of antipsychotics and evidence of disrupted connectivity in schizophrenia, we hypothesised that functional network connectivity, as assessed using network-based statistics, would exhibit differences between treatment response subtypes of schizophrenia and healthy controls. Resting-state functional MRI data were obtained from 17 healthy controls as well as individuals with schizophrenia who responded well to first-line atypical antipsychotics (first-line responders; FLR, n = 18), had failed at least two trials of antipsychotics but responded to clozapine (treatment-resistant schizophrenia; TRS, n = 18), or failed at least two trials of antipsychotics and a trial of clozapine (ultra-treatment-resistant schizophrenia; UTRS, n = 16). Data were pre-processed using the Advanced Normalization Toolkit and BrainWavelet Toolbox. Network connectivity was assessed using the Network-Based Statistics toolbox in Matlab. ANOVA revealed a significant difference in functional connectivity between groups that extended between cerebellar and parietal regions to the frontal cortex (p < 0.05). Post-hoc t-tests revealed weaker network connectivity in individuals with UTRS compared with healthy controls but no other differences between groups. Results demonstrated distinct differences in functional connectivity between individuals with UTRS and healthy controls. Future work must determine whether these changes occur prior to the onset of treatment and if they can be used to predict resistance to antipsychotics during first-episode psychosis. ? 2017",Clozapine; Magnetic resonance imaging; Network based statistics; Schizophrenia; Treatment resistance; Treatment response,"amisulpride; aripiprazole; clozapine; neuroleptic agent; olanzapine; quetiapine; risperidone; biological marker; clozapine; oxygen; adult; Article; cerebellum cortex; clinical article; controlled study; drug resistance; female; frontal cortex; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; male; parietal cortex; priority journal; resting state network; schizophrenia; treatment failure; treatment response; analysis of variance; blood; diagnostic imaging; drug effect; image processing; metabolism; middle aged; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; procedures; rest; schizophrenia; young adult; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Antipsychotic Agents; Biomarkers; Clozapine; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Net; Oxygen; Rest; Schizophrenia; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85031410143

Methods: The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study defines intentional injuries as a combination of self-harm (including suicide), interpersonal violence, collective violence (war), and legal intervention. We estimated number of deaths, years of life lost (YLLs), years lived with disability (YLDs), and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) for each type of intentional injuries. Results: In 2015, 28,695 individuals (95% UI: 25,474–37,832) died from self-harm, 35,626 (95% UI: 20,947–41,857) from interpersonal violence, and 143,858 (95% UI: 63,554–223,092) from collective violence and legal interventions. In 2015, collective violence and legal intervention was the fifth-leading cause of DALYs in the EMR and the leading cause in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya; they account for 49.7% of total DALYs in Syria. Conclusions: Our findings call for increased efforts to stabilize the region and assist in rebuilding the health systems, as well as increasing transparency and employing preventive strategies to reduce self-harm and interpersonal injuries. ? 2017, The Author(s).",Burden of disease; Eastern mediterranean region; Intentional injuries,adolescent; adult; automutilation; cost of illness; economics; female; global disease burden; global health; human; male; middle aged; Middle East; mortality; quality adjusted life year; statistics and numerical data; suicide; violence; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Cost of Illness; Female; Global Burden of Disease; Global Health; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Middle East; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Self-Injurious Behavior; Suicide; Violence; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85026846328

In part, these health care disparities result from a lack of understanding about disability by health care providers. The education of physicians is grounded in a biomedical model that emphasizes pathology, impairment, or dysfunction, rather than a social model of disability that focuses on removing barriers for individuals with disabilities and improving their capabilities. According to a recent report, only 2.7% of medical students disclosed having disabilities-far fewer than the proportion of people with disabilities in the U.S. population. Including students and other trainees with disabilities-those with lived experiences of disability who can empathize with patients and serve as an example for their peers-in medical education is one mechanism to address the health care disparities faced by individuals with disabilities. At present, medical students and residents with disabilities face structural barriers related to policies and procedures, clinical accommodations, disability and wellness support services, and the physical environment. Additionally, many face cultural barriers related to the overarching attitudes, beliefs, and values prevalent at their medical school.

Experimental Design: We performed exome sequencing of matched diagnosis, remission, and relapse samples from 50 CN-AML patients treated with intensive chemotherapy. Mutation patterns were correlated with clinical parameters. Results: Evolutionary patterns correlated with clinical outcome. Gain of mutations was associated with late relapse. Alterations of epigenetic regulators were frequently gained at relapse with recurring alterations of KDM6A constituting a mechanism of cytarabine resistance. Low KDM6A expression correlated with adverse clinical outcome, particularly in male patients. At complete remission, persistent mutations representing preleukemic lesions were observed in 48% of patients. The persistence of DNMT3A mutations correlated with shorter time to relapse. Conclusions: Chemotherapy resistance might be acquired through gain of mutations.

The rs373863828 variant was not associated with birth weight (P=0·129).Conclusions:We replicated the finding that a CREBRF variant is associated with increased body mass. We then built on the original findings by demonstrating the prevalence of the rs12513649 and rs373863828 variants in multiple Pacific population groups and by demonstrating that the rs373863828 variant is associated with growth in early childhood. Pacific population groups experience a disproportionately high burden of obesity, starting in early childhood. This new knowledge offers potential for evidence-based interventions aimed at establishing healthy growth trajectories from the earliest possible age. ? 2018 Macmillan Publishers Limited. part of Springer Nature.

ABCG2 rs2231142 (Q141K) has been reported to be associated with poor response to allopurinol, while there are conflicting data on the association between the genetically independent ABCG2 rs10011796 variant and allopurinol response. The aim of this study was to replicate the association of ABCG2 rs2231142 and rs10011796 with allopurinol response and perform a meta-analysis. Methods. Participants in the Long-term Allopurinol Safety Study Evaluating Outcomes in Gout Patients (LASSO) (n = 299) were studied. In patients with evidence of adherence to allopurinol therapy (plasma oxypurinol &gt; 20 μmol/l), good response was defined as serum urate &lt; 6 mg/dl on allopurinol ?300 mg/day and poor response as serum urate ?6 mg/dl despite allopurinol &gt; 300 mg/day. Association of rs2231142 and rs10011796 with poor response was tested in logistic regression models that included age, sex, BMI, ethnicity and estimated glomerular filtration rate. Results from the LASSO study and a subset of participants in the Genetics of Gout in Aotearoa New Zealand study (n = 296, including 264 from a previously published report) were combined by meta-analysis. Results. There was evidence for association of rs2231142 with allopurinol response [odds ratio (OR) = 2.35, P = 7.3 × 10-4] but not for rs10011796 (OR = 1.21, P = 0.33) in the LASSO cohort using an adjusted logistic regression model. Meta-analysis provided evidence of a significant association of rs2231142 with allopurinol response (OR = 2.43, P = 6.2 × 10-7), but not rs10011796 (OR = 1.06, P = 0.69). Conclusion. This study has confirmed the significant association of ABCG2 rs2231142 with poor response to allopurinol. ? The Author(s) 2018.

The objective was to test whether mitochondrial genetic variation and copy number in New Zealand Maori and Pacific (Polynesian) people in Aotearoa New Zealand associate with susceptibility to gout. Methods 437 whole mitochondrial genomes from Maori and Pacific people (predominantly men) from Aotearoa New Zealand (327 people with gout, 110 without gout) were sequenced. Mitochondrial DNA copy number variation was determined by assessing relative read depth using data produced from whole genome sequencing (32 cases, 43 controls) and targeted resequencing of urate loci (151 cases, 222 controls). Quantitative PCR was undertaken for replication of copy number findings in an extended sample set of 1159 Maori and Pacific men and women (612 cases, 547 controls). Results There was relatively little mitochondrial genetic diversity, with around 96% of those sequenced in this study belonging to the B4a1a and derived sublineages. A B haplogroup heteroplasmy in hypervariable region I was found to associate with a higher risk of gout among the mitochondrial sequenced sample set (position 16181: OR=1.57, P=0.001). Increased copies of mitochondrial DNA were found to protect against gout risk with the effect being consistent when using hyperuricaemic controls across each of the three independent sample sets (OR=0.89, P=0.007; OR=0.90, P=0.002; OR=0.76, P=0.03). Paradoxically, an increase of mitochondrial DNA also associated with an increase in gout flare frequency in people with gout in the two larger sample sets used for the copy number analysis (β=0.003, P=7.1×10 -7; β=0.08, P=1.2×10 -4). Conclusion Association of reduced copy number with gout in hyperuricaemia was replicated over three Polynesian sample sets. Our data are consistent with emerging research showing that mitochondria are important for the colocalisation of the NLRP3 and ASC inflammasome subunits, a process essential for the generation of interleukin-1β in gout. ?

However, alteplase only succeeds in reperfusing large vessel arterial occlusion prior to thrombectomy in a minority of patients. We hypothesized that tenecteplase is non-inferior to alteplase in achieving reperfusion at initial angiogram, when administered within 4.5 h of ischemic stroke onset, in patients planned to undergo endovascular therapy. Study design: EXTEND-IA TNK is an investigator-initiated, phase II, multicenter, prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded-endpoint non-inferiority study. Eligibility requires a diagnosis of ischemic stroke within 4.5 h of stroke onset, pre-stroke modified Rankin Scale?3 (no upper age limit), large vessel occlusion (internal carotid, basilar, or middle cerebral artery) on multimodal computed tomography and absence of contraindications to intravenous thrombolysis. Patients are randomized to either IV alteplase (0.9 mg/kg, max 90 mg) or tenecteplase (0.25 mg/kg, max 25 mg) prior to thrombectomy. Study outcomes: The primary outcome measure is reperfusion on the initial catheter angiogram, assessed as modified treatment in cerebral infarction 2 b/3 or the absence of retrievable thrombus. Secondary outcomes include modified Rankin Scale at day 90 and favorable clinical response (reduction in National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale by ?8 points or reaching 0–1) at day 3.

Methods: A cross-sectional analysis of a nationally representative health and well-being survey of 8500 New Zealand high school students conducted from March through November 2012. Students’ self-reported suicide attempts and repeated non-suicidal self-injury was examined in relation to student reports of self-harming behaviour among friends and family as well as data from school administrators of completed suicides within the school community. Results: Almost 1 in 20 (4.5%) students reported a suicide attempt in the last 12 months and 7.9% reported repeated non-suicidal self-injury in the last 12 months. The risk of both suicide attempts and repeated non-suicidal self-injury was highest among females, students from homes with economic deprivation and among students reporting an episode of low mood in the previous 12 months. Students exposed to suicide attempts or completed suicide among friends and/or family members were at increased risk of reporting attempted suicide and repeated non-suicidal self-injury in the last year. There was no association between completed suicide in school community and students self-reported suicide attempts or repeated non-suicidal self-injury. Conclusions: Low mood and exposure to suicide attempts of friends and family members are associated with suicide attempts and repeated non-suicidal self-injury in New Zealand high school students.

Peptide ligands of these receptors display biased agonism and this may provide future therapeutic advantage. Recent active structures of the calcitonin (CT) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors reveal distinct engagement of peptides with extracellular loops (ECLs) 2 and 3, and mutagenesis of the GLP-1R has implicated these loops in dynamics of receptor activation. In the current study, we have mutated ECLs 2 and 3 of the human CT receptor (CTR), to interrogate receptor expression, peptide affinity and efficacy. Integration of these data with insights from the CTR and GLP-1R active structures, revealed marked diversity in mechanisms of peptide engagement and receptor activation between the CTR and GLP-1R. While the CTR ECL2 played a key role in conformational propagation linked to Gs/cAMP signalling this was mechanistically distinct from that of GLP-1R ECL2. Moreover, ECL3 was a hotspot for distinct ligand- and pathway-specific effects, and this has implications for the future design of biased agonists of class B GPCRs. ? 2018 The Author(s)",Biased agonism; Calcitonin receptor; G protein-coupled receptor; GPCR structure-function; Molecular modelling,"alanine; alpha calcitonin gene related peptide; amylin; calcitonin; calcitonin receptor; cyclic AMP; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor; hormone receptor blocking agent; inositol phosphate; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; receptor activity modifying protein 2; receptor activity modifying protein 3; sct (8 32); tau protein; unclassified drug; calcitonin receptor; peptide fragment; protein binding; agonist potency; amino acid sequence; Article; cAMP signaling; cell surface; competitive inhibition; concentration response; conformational transition; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug receptor binding; drug selectivity; extracellular loop; human; IC50; MAPK signaling; maximum binding capacity; maximum drug effect; molecular dynamics; molecular model; mutagenesis; mutant; nonhuman; pig; priority journal; protein conformation; protein expression; protein structure; receptor affinity; salmonine; signal transduction; agonists; cell line; chemistry; dose response; drug effect; extracellular fluid; genetics; metabolism; physiology; protein secondary structure; protein tertiary structure; Amino Acid Sequence; Cell Line; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Extracellular Fluid; Humans; Peptide Fragments; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Secondary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Receptors, Calcitonin",2-s2.0-85042481521

Gut hormones have emerged as possible modulators of inflammatory response. The aim was to investigate the associations between pro-inflammatory cytokines and a comprehensive panel of gut hormones after an episode of acute pancreatitis. Materials and methods: Fasting blood samples were collected to measure cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, and MCP-1) and gut hormones (cholecystokinin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), ghrelin, glicentin, glucagon-like peptide-1, oxyntomodulin, peptide YY, secretin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide). A series of linear regression analyses was conducted and four statistical models were used to adjust for patient- and pancreatitis-related covariates. Results: A total of 83 individuals were recruited. GIP and peptide YY were significantly (p OpenSPiltSPi 0.001) associated with IL-6, TNFα, MCP-1, consistently in all the four models. Every 1?ng/mL change in GIP resulted in a 16.2, 3.2, and 50.8% increase in IL-6, TNFα, and MCP-1, respectively, in the most adjusted model. Every 1?ng/mL change in peptide YY resulted in a 7.0, 2.4, and 32.1% increase in IL-6, TNFα, and MCP-1, respectively, in the most adjusted model. GIP independently contributed 29.0–36.5% and peptide YY ? 17.4–48.9% to circulating levels of the studied pro-inflammatory cytokines. The other seven studied gut hormones did not show consistently significant associations with pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: GIP and peptide YY appear to be involved in perpetuation of subclinical inflammation following an episode of acute pancreatitis, which is known to play an important role in the pathogenesis of blood glucose derangements. These findings advance the understanding of mechanisms underlying diabetes of the exocrine pancreas and have translational implications. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Acute pancreatitis; Chronic hyperglycaemia; Gastric inhibitory peptide; Interleukin-6; Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; Peptide YY,cholecystokinin; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; gastrointestinal hormone; ghrelin; glicentin; glucagon like peptide 1; glucose; interleukin 6; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; oxyntomodulin; peptide YY; secretin; tumor necrosis factor; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; gastric inhibitory polypeptide; gastrointestinal hormone; interleukin 6; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; peptide YY; tumor necrosis factor; acute pancreatitis; adult; Article; blood sampling; cross-sectional study; female; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; hormone blood level; human; hyperglycemia; major clinical study; male; middle aged; protein blood level; acute disease; aged; blood; complication; diet restriction; hyperglycemia; pancreatitis; physiology; pregnancy; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Chemokine CCL2; Cross-Sectional Studies; Fasting; Female; Gastric Inhibitory Polypeptide; Gastrointestinal Hormones; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Interleukin-6; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis; Peptide YY; Pregnancy; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha,2-s2.0-85039717796

Following the screening of a 900-compound pretomanid analogue library, several hits with more suitable potency, solubility, and microsomal stability were identified, and the superior efficacy of newly synthesized 6R enantiomers with phenylpyridine-based side chains was established through head-to-head assessments in a Leishmania donovani mouse model. Two such leads (R-84 and R-89) displayed promising activity in the more stringent Leishmania infantum hamster model but were unexpectedly found to be potent inhibitors of hERG. An extensive structure-activity relationship investigation pinpointed two compounds (R-6 and pyridine R-136) with better solubility and pharmacokinetic properties that also provided excellent oral efficacy in the same hamster model (>97% parasite clearance at 25 mg/kg, twice daily) and exhibited minimal hERG inhibition. Additional profiling earmarked R-6 as the favored backup development candidate. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"1 [(tert butyldimethylsilyl)oxy] 3 (2,4 dinitro 1h imidazol 1 yl) 2 methylpropan 2 ol; 1 [3 [(tert butyldimethylsilyl)oxy] 2 methyl 2 [(tetrahydro 2h pyran 2 yl)oxy]propyl] 2,4 dinitro 1h imidazole; 1,3 oxazine derivative; 2 bromo 4 nitro 1 [3 [(tetrahydro 2h pyran 2 yl)oxy] 4 [(triisopropylsilyl)oxy]butyl] 1h imidazole; 2 nitro 5,6,7,8 tetrahydroimidazo[2,1 b][1,3]oxazepin 7 ol; 2 nitro 6 [[4' (trifluoromethoxy)(1,1' biphenyl) 2 yl]methoxy] 6,7 dihydro 5h imidazo[2,1 b][1,3]oxazine; 2 nitro 7 [(tetrahydro 2h pyran 2 yl)oxy] 5,6,7,8 tetrahydroimidazo[2,1 b][1,3]oxazepine; 2 nitro 7 [[4 (trifluoromethoxy)benzyl]oxy] 5,6,7,8 tetrahydroimidazo[2,1 b][1,3]oxazepine; 2 nitro 7 [[[4 (trifluoromethoxy)benzyl]oxy]methyl] 6,7 dihydro 5h imidazo[2,1 b][1,3]oxazine; 4 (2 bromo 4 nitro 1h imidazol 1 yl) 2 [(tetrahydro 2h pyran 2 yl)oxy]butan 1 ol; 6 methyl 2 nitro 6 [(tetrahydro 2h pyran 2 yl)oxy] 6,7 dihydro 5h imidazo[2,1 b][1,3]oxazine; 6 methyl 2 nitro 6 [[4 (trifluoromethoxy)benzyl]oxy] 6,7 dihydro 5h imidazo[2,1 b][1,3]oxazine; 6 methyl 2 nitro 6,7 dihydro 5h imidazo[2,1 b][1,3]oxazin 6 ol; 6 [(2 iodobenzyl)oxy] 2 nitro 6,7 dihydro 5h imidazo[2,1 b][1,3]oxazine; amphotericin B; amphotericin B lipid complex; antileishmanial agent; cytochrome P450 3A4; delamanid; imidazole derivative; ketoconazole; miltefosine; nitro derivative; paromomycin; potassium channel HERG; pretomanid; stibogluconate sodium; tolbutamide; tuberculostatic agent; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antiparasitic agent; cytochrome P450 3A; cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor; cytochrome P450 3A4, mouse; oxazine derivative; potassium channel HERG; alkylation; Ames test; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; area under the curve; Article; controlled study; derivatization; desilylation; drug bioavailability; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug screening; drug solubility; drug synthesis; enantiomer; female; growth inhibition; hamster model; human; human cell; IC50; Kinetoplastida; Leishmania; Leishmania aethiopica; Leishmania amazonensis; Leishmania donovani; Leishmania infantum; Leishmania major; Leishmania mexicana; Leishmania panamensis; lipophilicity; male; metabolic stability; minimum inhibitory concentration; Mitsunobu reaction; mouse; nonhuman; parasite clearance; parasite load; plasma protein binding; Sonogashira reaction; structure activity relation; Suzuki reaction; Trypanosoma brucei; Trypanosoma cruzi; visceral leishmaniasis; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Bagg albino mouse; cell membrane permeability; Chagas disease; dose response; drug effect; growth, development and aging; hamster; Mesocricetus; microbial sensitivity test; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; parasitology; preclinical study; rat; Sprague Dawley rat; synthesis; visceral leishmaniasis; Animals; Antiparasitic Agents; Cell Membrane Permeability; Chagas Disease; Cricetinae; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A Inhibitors; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; ERG1 Potassium Channel; Leishmania donovani; Leishmania infantum; Leishmaniasis, Visceral; Mesocricetus; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Oxazines; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Structure-Activity Relationship",2-s2.0-85044248237

Here we report the identification, optimization and evaluation of 1-(1H-indol-1-yl)ethanone derivatives as CBP/EP300 inhibitors starting from fragment-based virtual screening (FBVS). A cocrystal structure of the inhibitor (22e) in complex with CBP provides a solid structural basis for further optimization. The most potent compound 32h binds to the CBP bromodomain and has an IC50 value of 0.037 μM in the AlphaScreen assay which was 2 times more potent than the reported CBP bromodomain inhibitor SGC-CBP30 in our hands. 32h also exhibit high selectivity for CBP/EP300 over other bromodomain-containing proteins. Notably, the ester derivative (29h) of compound 32h markedly inhibits cell growth in several prostate cancer cell lines including LNCaP, 22Rv1 and LNCaP derived C4-2B. Compound 29h suppresses the mRNA expression of full length AR (AR-FL), AR target genes and other oncogene in LNCaP cells. 29h also reduces the expression of PSA, the biomarker of prostate cancer. CBP/EP300 inhibitor 29h represents a promising lead compound for the development of new therapeutics for the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer. ? 2018 Elsevier Masson SAS",Bromodomain inhibitor; CBP; EP300; Prostate cancer,"1 (1h indol 1 yl)ethanone derivative; antineoplastic agent; bromodomain inhibitor; E1A associated p300 protein; enzalutamide; ester derivative; messenger RNA; prostate specific antigen; tert butyl 3 (1 acetyl 5 methoxy 1h indole 3 carboxamido) 5 (furan 2 yl)benzoate; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; bone sialoprotein (35-62), human; E1A associated p300 protein; EP300 protein, human; indole derivative; peptide fragment; sialoglycoprotein; 22Rv1 cell line; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer inhibition; castration resistant prostate cancer; controlled study; crystal structure; drug potency; drug screening; gene expression; human; human cell; LNCaP cell line; structure activity relation; antagonists and inhibitors; castration resistant prostate cancer; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; dose response; drug development; drug effects; drug screening; isolation and purification; male; metabolism; pathology; synthesis; tumor cell culture; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Discovery; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; E1A-Associated p300 Protein; Humans; Indoles; Male; Molecular Structure; Peptide Fragments; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; Sialoglycoproteins; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-85041798104

The aim of this study was to examine the association between fruit, vegetables, pulses and nut intake and body mass index (BMI) across countries in adolescents (13-14 years) and children (6-7 years). Data from the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood; 77,243 children’s parents and 201,871 adolescents was used to examine the association between dietary intake (Food Frequency Questionnaire) and BMI using general linear models, adjusting for country gross national index. Adolescents who consumed fruit, vegetables, pulses and nuts three or more times a week had a lower BMI than the never or occasional group; eating nuts three or more times a week, was associated with a BMI value of 0.274 kg/m2 lower than the never group (p &lt; 0.001). Compared to children who never or occasionally reported eating vegetables, those reporting that they ate vegetables three or more times per week had a lower BMI of -0.079 kg/m2. In this large global study, an inverse association was observed between BMI and the reported increasing intake of vegetables in 6-7 years old and fruit, vegetables, pulses and nuts in adolescents. This study supports current dietary recommendations which emphasize the consumption of vegetables, nut and pulses, although the effect sizes were small. ? 2018 by the authors.

Organoplatinum compounds are significantly less investigated than the analogous coordination compounds. We report here rollover cyclometalated Pt compounds based on 2,2′-bipyridine which are demonstrated to be potent antitumor agents both in vitro and in vivo. Variation of the co-ligands on the Pt(2,2′-bipyridine) backbone resulted in the establishment of structure-activity relationships. They showed that the biological activity was in general inversely correlated with the reaction kinetics to biomolecules as shown for amino acids, proteins, and DNA. The less stable compounds caused higher reactivity with biomolecules and were shown to induce p53-dependent DNA damage. In contrast, the presence of bulky PTA and PPh3 ligands was demonstrated to cause lower reactivity and increased antineoplastic activity. Such compounds were devoid of DNA-damaging activity and induced ATF4, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress pathway. The lead complex inhibited tumor growth similar to oxaliplatin while showing no signs of toxicity in test mice. Therefore, we demonstrated that it is possible to fine-tune rollover-cyclometalated Pt(II) compounds to target different cancer pathways and be a means to overcome the side effects associated with cisplatin and analogous compounds in cancer chemotherapy. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.",,,2-s2.0-85042905483

This DECT study assessed crystal deposition in patients with gout treated with stable-dose allopurinol, and investigated potential clinical determinants for crystal deposition. METHODS: Patients with gout treated with allopurinol ?300?mg daily for at least 3 months were prospectively recruited from the USA and New Zealand, using monitored enrolment to include approximately 25% patients with palpable tophi and approximately 50% with serum urate (sUA) levels <6.0?mg/dL (<357?mol/L). MSU crystal deposition was measured in the hands/wrists, feet/ankles/Achilles and knees bilaterally. The presence and total volume of crystals were assessed by DECT and analysed according to sUA levels and gout characteristics. RESULTS: Among 152 patients receiving allopurinol ?300?mg/day for 5.1 years on average, 69.1% had crystal deposition on DECT, with a median total crystal volume of 0.16?cm3 (range: 0.01-19.53?cm3). The prevalence of crystal deposition ranged from 46.9% among patients with sUA <6.0?mg/dL and no palpable tophi to 90.0% among those with sUA ?6.0?mg/dL and tophi. Total volume of crystal deposition was positively associated with sUA ?6.0?mg/dL, gout flares within the past 3 months and tophi. Total volume of crystal deposition correlated positively with Patient Global Impression of Disease Activity scores. CONCLUSION: A substantial proportion of patients without palpable tophi have MSU crystal deposition, despite receiving allopurinol doses ?300?mg/day for a considerable duration. Patients with higher sUA and clinical features of severe disease have a higher frequency and greater volume of MSU crystal deposition. ?

Comparing policies and systems could allow countries to learn from each other to address global and nation-specific challenges. We compare national PAEHR policy (hard and soft regulation) and services in 10 countries. Methods: PAEHR policy and system documentation was gathered from Australia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden and the United States. A basic analytic model for policy analysis was used to delimit our focus to policy content, followed by an inductive thematic analysis across countries, in which we clustered initial themes into a set of categories of PAEHR service “approaches” related to three specific content areas. Results: Although all 10 countries ensured some patient rights to access medical records, policies and systems were highly variable, as were the technological processes arising from these. In particular, three policy areas showed great variability. Depending upon country of origin, a patient would encounter differences in: login procedures (security), access to own and other patients’ data during adolescence (user rights), and types of medical data made available to the patient (data sets). Conclusions: Individuals encounter very different access rights to their medical data depending on where they live. Countries may be able to develop improved policies by examining how other nations have solved common problems. Harmonizing policies is also an initial step likely to be needed before cross-national PAEHRs could be possible. ? 2017 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine",International comparison; Patient accessible electronic health records; Patient health records; Patient portal,Article; Australia; computer security; Denmark; electronic health record; Estonia; Finland; France; health care policy; health care system; human; information service; medical information; Netherlands; New Zealand; Norway; patient right; priority journal; Sweden; United States,2-s2.0-85043591646

After myocardial infarction (MI), the left ventricle typically remodels in response to physiological challenges. Several methods have been proposed in the literature to describe statistical shape changes. Which method best characterizes the left ventricular remodeling after MI is an open research question. A better descriptor of remodeling is expected to provide a more accurate evaluation of disease status in MI patients. We therefore designed a challenge to test shape characterization in MI given a set of three-dimensional left ventricular surface points. The training set comprised 100 MI patients, and 100 asymptomatic volunteers (AV). The challenge was initiated in 2015 at the Statistical Atlases and Computational Models of the Heart workshop, in conjunction with the MICCAI conference. The training set with labels was provided to participants, who were asked to submit the likelihood of MI from a different (validation) set of 200 cases (100 AV and 100 MI). Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve were used as the outcome measures. The goals of this challenge were to 1) establish a common dataset for evaluating statistical shape modeling algorithms in MI, and 2) test whether statistical shape modeling provides additional information characterizing MI patients over standard clinical measures. Eleven groups with a wide variety of classification and feature extraction approaches participated in this challenge. All methods achieved excellent classification results with accuracy ranges from 0.83 to 0.98. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were all above 0.90.

Resurgence models the elimination or reduction of reinforcers during treatment and reinstatement models the re-presentation of reinforcers previously maintaining problem behavior. The present study examined individual and combined effects of resurgence and reinstatement in a translational model of treatment relapse with three children diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder. We first reinforced and then extinguished an arbitrary response while providing access to a preferred toy to model a version of noncontingent reinforcement with extinction. In the following phases, we examined resurgence by removing the toy, reinstatement by presenting the training reinforcer response-independently, and a combination of resurgence and reinstatement. Overall, relapse of target responding reliably exceeded functionally similar responses never reinforced in the experimental situation. Most importantly, relapse tended to be greater when combining resurgence and reinstatement than when assessing either alone. These findings support previous studies showing that combinations of operations can increase treatment relapse. This translational model arranging simulated problem behavior with arbitrary tasks provides a platform from which to thoroughly and systematically assess methods for understanding and improving behavioral treatments. ? 2018 Society for the Experimental Analysis of Behavior",Autism Spectrum Disorder; differential reinforcement of alternative behavior; noncontingent reinforcement; reinstatement; resurgence; translational research; treatment relapse,"autism; behavior disorder; behavior therapy; child; female; human; male; preschool child; psychology; recurrent disease; reinforcement; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Behavior Therapy; Child; Child Behavior Disorders; Child, Preschool; Extinction, Psychological; Female; Humans; Male; Recurrence; Reinforcement (Psychology)",2-s2.0-85042552417

Methods: Five hundred nine patients with gout were enrolled in a cross-sectional study during a routine clinical care visit at 17 international sites. Data were collected to classify patients as experiencing or not experiencing a gout flare, according to a provisional definition. A local expert rheumatologist performed the final independent adjudication of gout flare status. Sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the diagnostic performance of gout flare definitions. Results: The mean ± SD age of the patients was 57.5 ± 13.9 years, and 89% were male. The definition requiring fulfillment of at least 3 of 4 criteria (patient-defined gout flare, pain at rest score of >3 on a 0–10-point numerical rating scale, presence of at least 1 swollen joint, and presence of at least 1 warm joint) was 85% sensitive and 95% specific in confirming the presence of a gout flare, with an accuracy of 92%. The ROC area under the curve was 0.97. The definition based on a classification and regression tree algorithm (entry point, pain at rest score >3, followed by patient-defined flare “yes”) was 73% sensitive and 96% specific. Conclusion: The definition of gout flare that requires fulfillment of at least 3 of 4 patient-reported criteria is now validated to be sensitive, specific, and accurate for gout flares, as demonstrated using an independent large international patient sample. The availability of a validated gout flare definition will improve the ascertainment of an important clinical outcome in studies of gout. ? 2017, American College of Rheumatology",,antigout agent; adult; algorithm; Article; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; disease exacerbation; female; gout; human; joint swelling; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; numeric rating scale; predictive value; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; rheumatologist; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; aged; clinical trial; gout; severity of illness index; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gout; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index,2-s2.0-85041569387

This review focusses on the natural history of the disorder, in particular its changing epidemiology, recent discoveries about its genetic basis and current approaches to diagnosis and treatment. While there is strong evidence for genetic predisposition to Paget's disease, there is also compelling evidence that it is becoming less prevalent, the age of patients at presentation is increasing and that the extent of skeletal involvement is diminishing, implying that there is an important, but as yet unidentified, environmental factor in its etiology. Contemporary patients are typically elderly and have few bones involved.

We set out to develop a powerful and robust predictor for therapy resistance for intensively treated adult patients. We used two large gene expression data sets (n=856) to develop a predictor of therapy resistance, which was validated in an independent cohort analyzed by RNA sequencing (n=250). In addition to gene expression markers, standard clinical and laboratory variables as well as the mutation status of 68 genes were considered during construction of the model. The final predictor (PS29MRC) consisted of 29 gene expression markers and a cytogenetic risk classification. A continuous predictor is calculated as a weighted linear sum of the individual variables. In addition, a cut off was defined to divide patients into a high-risk and a low-risk group for resistant disease. PS29MRC was highly significant in the validation set, both as a continuous score (OR=2.39, P=8.63·10 -9 , AUC=0.76) and as a dichotomous classifier (OR=8.03, P=4.29·10 -9 ); accuracy was 77%. In multivariable models, only TP53 mutation, age and PS29MRC (continuous: OR=1.75, P=0.0011; dichotomous: OR=4.44, P=0.00021) were left as significant variables. PS29MRC dominated all models when compared with currently used predictors, and also predicted overall survival independently of established markers. When integrated into the European LeukemiaNet (ELN) 2017 genetic risk stratification, four groups (median survival of 8, 18, 41 months, and not reached) could be defined (P=4.01·10 -10 ). PS29MRC will make it possible to design trials which stratify induction treatment according to the probability of response, and refines the ELN 2017 classification. ? 2018 Ferrata Storti Foundation.",,"anthracycline; cytarabine; nucleophosmin; protein p53; transcription factor RUNX1; accuracy; acute myeloid leukemia; adult; aged; amplicon; area under the curve; Article; clinical decision making; controlled study; cytogenetics; female; gene expression; gene mutation; genetic risk; human; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; multicenter study; mutational analysis; myelodysplastic syndrome; overall survival; phase 3 clinical trial; prognosis; randomized controlled trial; receiver operating characteristic; RNA sequence; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; survival analysis; very elderly; acute myeloid leukemia; adolescent; clinical trial; drug resistance; gene expression profiling; genetics; machine learning; middle aged; mutation; predictive value; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); remission; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Machine Learning; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Remission Induction; Survival Analysis; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85042780342

By reaching the large bowel, RS can function as a prebiotic carbohydrate, i.e., it can shape the structure and activity of bowel bacterial communities towards a profile that confers health benefits. However, knowledge about the fate of RS in complex intestinal communities and the microbial members involved in its degradation is limited. In this study, 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA)-based stable isotope probing (RNA-SIP) was used to identify mouse bowel bacteria involved in the assimilation of RS or its derivatives directly in their natural gut habitat. Stable-isotope [U13C]-labeled native potato starch was administrated to mice, and caecal contents were collected before 0 h and 2 h and 4 h after administration. ‘Heavy’, isotope-labeled [13C]RNA species, presumably derived from bacteria that have metabolized the labeled starch, were separated from ‘light’, unlabeled [12C]RNA species by fractionation of isolated total RNA in isopycnic-density gradients. Inspection of different density gradients showed a continuous increase in ‘heavy’ 16S rRNA in caecal samples over the course of the experiment. Sequencing analyses of unlabeled and labeled 16S amplicons particularly suggested a group of unclassified Clostridiales, Dorea, and a few other taxa (Bacteroides, Turicibacter) to be most actively involved in starch assimilation in vivo. In addition, metabolic product analyses revealed that the predominant13C-labeled short chain fatty acid (SCFA) in caecal contents produced from the [U13C] starch was butyrate. For the first time, this study provides insights into the metabolic transformation of RS by intestinal bacterial communities directly within a gut ecosystem, which will finally help to better understand its prebiotic potential and possible applications in human health. ? 2018 by the authors.

Adherence to medication and availability of rehabilitation are suboptimal in this patient group, which increases the risk of hospitalization. Objective: This pilot study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of a robot delivering telehealth care to increase adherence to medication and home rehabilitation, improve quality of life, and reduce hospital readmission compared with a standard care control group. Methods: At discharge from hospital for a COPD admission, 60 patients were randomized to receive a robot at home for 4 months or to a control group. Number of hospitalization days for respiratory admissions over the 4-month study period was the primary outcome. Medication adherence, frequency of rehabilitation exercise, and quality of life were also assessed. Implementation interviews as well as benefit-cost analysis were conducted. Results: Intention-to-treat and per protocol analyses showed no significant differences in the number of respiratory-related hospitalizations between groups. The intervention group was more adherent to their long-acting inhalers (mean number of prescribed puffs taken per day=48.5%) than the control group (mean 29.5%, P=.03, d=0.68) assessed via electronic recording. Self-reported adherence was also higher in the intervention group after controlling for covariates (P=.04). The intervention group increased their rehabilitation exercise frequency compared with the control group (mean difference -4.53, 95% CI -7.16 to -1.92). There were no significant differences in quality of life. Of the 25 patients who had the robot, 19 had favorable attitudes. Conclusions: This pilot study suggests that a homecare robot can improve adherence to medication and increase exercise. Further research is needed with a larger sample size to further investigate effects on hospitalizations after improvements are made to the robots. The robots could be especially useful for patients struggling with adherence. ?

Methods: Design: a randomised controlled trial was used. Setting: the setting was 307 preschool services across eight socioeconomically diverse government areas in Melbourne, Australia. Participants: a total of 545 parents of inhibited 4-year-old children: 498 retained at 1-year follow up. Early intervention: Cool Little Kids parenting group programme was implemented. Primary outcomes: the primary outcomes were child DSM-IV anxiety disorders (assessor blind) and internalising problems. Secondary outcomes: the secondary outcomes were parenting practices and parent mental health. Results: At 1-year follow up (mean (standard deviation) age = 5.8 (0.4) years), there was little difference in anxiety disorders between the intervention and control arms (44.2% vs 50.2%; adjusted odds ratio = 0.86, 95% confidence interval = [0.60, 1.25], p = 0.427).

Parents’ participation in the intervention was modest (29.4% attended most groups, 20.5% used skills most of the time during the year). A priori interaction tests suggested that for children with anxious parents, the intervention reduced anxiety disorders and internalising symptoms after 1 year.

Over the years, various physical and chemical methods have been developed to synthesize these nanostructures which are usually expensive and potentially harmful to human health and the environment. Synthesis of iron nanoparticles (INPs) by using plant extract is now of great interest in order to develop a novel and sustainable approach toward green chemistry. In this method the chemical compounds and organic solvents are replaced with phytochemicals and aqueous matrixes, respectively. Similar to any chemical and biochemical reaction, factors such as reaction temperature, concentration of iron precursor, concentration of leaf extract, and reaction time have critical effects on the reaction yield. This review focuses on the novel approaches used for green synthesis of INPs by using plant resources. The currently available statistics including the factors affecting the synthesis process and potential applications of the fabricated nanoparticles are discussed. Recommendations are also given for areas of future research in order to improve the production process. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Biosynthesis; Eco-friendly; Environmental friendly; Green chemistry; Green synthesis; Metal nanoparticles,Biochemistry; Biosynthesis; Iron; Metal nanoparticles; Plant extracts; Biochemical reactions; Eco-friendly; Environmental-friendly; Green chemistry; Green synthesis; Nanoscale iron particles; Physical and chemical properties; Reaction temperature; Synthesis (chemical); chemical compound; ferric hydroxide; iron nanoparticle; magnetite nanoparticle; organic solvent; phytochemical; plant extract; ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide; iron; metal nanoparticle; antioxidant activity; aqueous solution; biochemical analysis; concentration (parameters); green chemistry; nonhuman; pH; plant; plant leaf; quantum yield; reaction time; Review; synthesis; temperature; chemistry; drug delivery system; ecosystem restoration; green chemistry; metabolism; nanotechnology; particle size; plant; procedures; ultrastructure; Drug Delivery Systems; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Green Chemistry Technology; Iron; Metal Nanoparticles; Nanotechnology; Particle Size; Phytochemicals; Plant Extracts; Plants,2-s2.0-85038389013

Infants with mild or no evidence of injury may also be at risk of altered brain development, with evidence impaired cell maturation. The underlying causes are multifactorial and include exposure of both the fetus and newborn to hypoxia-ischemia, inflammation (chorioamnionitis) and infection, adverse maternal lifestyle choices (smoking, drug and alcohol use, diet) and obesity, as well as the significant demand that adaptation to post-natal life places on immature organs. Further, many fetuses and infants may have combinations of these events, and repeated (multi-hit) events that may induce tolerance to injury or sensitize to greater injury. Currently there are no treatments to prevent preterm injury or impaired neurodevelopment. However, inflammation is a common pathway for many of these insults, and clinical and experimental evidence demonstrates that acute and chronic inflammation is associated with impaired brain development. This review examines our current knowledge about the relationship between inflammation and preterm brain development, and the potential for stem cell therapy to provide neuroprotection and neurorepair through reducing inflammation and release of trophic factors, which promote cell maturation and repair. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Hypoxia-ischemia; Inflammation; Injury; Neurodevelopment; Preterm; Stem cells,"glucocorticoid; glucose; brain development; brain infection; cell maturation; cell regeneration; chronic inflammation; developmental disorder; human; long term care; nerve cell differentiation; nervous system inflammation; neuroprotection; prematurity; priority journal; Review; stem cell transplantation; animal; brain; chorioamnionitis; cytology; disease model; embryology; female; fetus; fetus development; growth, development and aging; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; immunology; inflammation; mental disease; newborn; oligodendroglia; pregnancy; prematurity; prenatal exposure; Animals; Brain; Chorioamnionitis; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Fetal Development; Fetus; Humans; Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Inflammation; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Oligodendroglia; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",2-s2.0-85038036960

However, since the identification of the HTT gene, there has been no advance in the development of therapeutic strategies to prevent or reduce the progression of HD. With the recent advances in stem cell biology and human cell reprogramming technologies, several novel and exciting pathways have emerged allowing researchers to enhance their understanding of the pathogenesis of HD, to identify and screen potential drug targets, and to explore alternative donor cell sources for cell replacement therapy. This review will discuss the role of compensatory neurogenesis in the HD brain, the use of stem cell-based therapies for HD to replace or prevent cell loss, and the recent advance of cell reprogramming to model and/or treat HD. These new technologies, coupled with advances in genome editing herald a promising new era for HD research with the potential to identify a therapeutic strategy to alleviate this debilitating disorder.

Objective: This phase IB trial of demcizumab, an IgG2 humanized monoclonal antibody directed against DLL4, was undertaken to determine its maximum tolerated dose, safety, immunogenicity, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics, combined with standard chemotherapy. Patients and Methods: Forty-six treatment-naive patients with metastatic non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were enrolled in this open-label, dose-escalation study using a standard 6 + 6 design. Demcizumab (2.5, 5.0, and 7.5?mg/kg) was given once every 3?weeks with standard doses of pemetrexed and carboplatin using a continuous (six cycles followed by demcizumab maintenance) or a truncated demcizumab regimen (four cycles followed by pemetrexed maintenance). Results: Initially, continuous demcizumab was given until progression but two patients developed grade 3 pulmonary hypertension and congestive heart failure after eight or more infusions. Thereafter, 23 patients were treated with a truncated regimen of demcizumab, which was not associated with any grade 3 or greater cardiopulmonary toxicity. Common adverse events were hypertension, raised brain natriuretic peptide, and those expected from carboplatin and pemetrexed alone. Twenty of 40 evaluable patients (50%) had objective tumor responses. In peripheral blood, demcizumab treatment modulated the expression of genes regulating Notch signaling and angiogenesis, and achieved concentrations exceeding those saturating DLL4 binding. Conclusions: This study has identified a truncated dosing regimen and recommended phase II dose of demcizumab (5?mg/kg q3-weekly ×4) for subsequent clinical evaluation in combination with standard carboplatin and pemetrexed chemotherapy.

However, the responses induced by vaccines in cancer patients have generally been disappointing. To improve vaccine function, we investigated the possibility of exploiting the immunostimulatory capacity of type 1 Natural killer T (NKT) cells, a cell type enriched in lymphoid tissues that can trigger improved antigen-presenting function in dendritic cells (DCs). In this phase I dose escalation study, we treated eight patients with high-risk surgically resected stage II–IV melanoma with intravenous autologous monocyte-derived DCs loaded with the NKT cell agonist α-GalCer and peptides derived from the cancer testis antigen NY-ESO-1. Two synthetic long peptides spanning defined immunogenic regions of the NY-ESO-1 sequence were used. This therapy proved to be safe and immunologically effective, inducing increases in circulating NY-ESO-1-specific T cells that could be detected directly ex vivo in seven out of eight patients. These responses were achieved using as few as 5?×?105 peptide-loaded cells per dose. Analysis after in vitro restimulation showed increases in polyfunctional CD4+ and CD8+ T cells that were capable of manufacturing two or more cytokines simultaneously. Evidence of NKT cell proliferation and/or NKT cell-associated cytokine secretion was seen in most patients. In light of these strong responses, the concept of including NKT cell agonists in vaccine design requires further investigation. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Dendritic cell; Melanoma; NKT cell; NY-ESO-1; α-Galactosylceramide,"alpha galactosylceramide; cancer vaccine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; HLA antigen; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 10; interleukin 12p40; interleukin 12p70; interleukin 13; interleukin 15; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; interleukin 8; interleukin 9; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monocyte chemotactic protein 1 alpha; monocyte chemotactic protein 1 beta; NY ESO 1 antigen; RANTES; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; alpha-galactosylceramide; CTAG1B protein, human; galactosylceramide; membrane protein; tumor antigen; adult; aged; antigen presenting cell; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer immunization; cancer immunotherapy; cancer patient; cancer staging; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell function; cell proliferation; clinical article; cutaneous melanoma; cytokine release; dendritic cell; drug design; drug dose escalation; drug safety; ex vivo study; female; flow cytometry; high risk patient; human; lymphocyte function; male; malignant cutaneous melanoma; middle aged; multiple cycle treatment; natural killer T cell; open study; phase 1 clinical trial; priority journal; prophylaxis; protein analysis; vaccine production; clinical trial; dendritic cell; genetics; immunology; melanoma; metabolism; Antigens, Neoplasm; Dendritic Cells; Galactosylceramides; Humans; Melanoma; Membrane Proteins",2-s2.0-85032802745

We compared the effectiveness of (LSG) versus SR-LRYGB among patients with T2D and morbid obesity. Methods: Prospective, randomised, parallel, 2-arm, blinded clinical trial conducted in a single Auckland (New Zealand) centre. Eligible patients aged 20–55?years, T2D of at least 6?months duration and BMI 35–65?kg/m2 were randomised 1:1 to LSG (n?=?58) or SR-LRYGB (n?=?56) using random number codes disclosed after anaesthesia induction.

Although fully-automated left ventricular (LV) analysis was performed in the original acquisition, this was not designed for unsupervised incorporation into epidemiological studies. We sought to evaluate automated LV mass and volume (Siemens syngo InlineVF versions D13A and E11C), against manual analysis in a substantial sub-cohort of UK Biobank participants. Eight readers from two centers, trained to give consistent results, manually analyzed 4874 UK Biobank cases for LV end-diastolic volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF) and LV mass (LVM). Agreement between manual and InlineVF automated analyses were evaluated using Bland–Altman analysis and the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). Tenfold cross-validation was used to establish a linear regression calibration between manual and InlineVF results. InlineVF D13A returned results in 4423 cases, whereas InlineVF E11C returned results in 4775 cases and also reported LVM. Rapid visual assessment of the E11C results found 178 cases (3.7%) with grossly misplaced contours or landmarks. In the remaining 4597 cases, LV function showed good agreement: ESV ?6.4 ± 9.0?ml, 0.853 (mean ± SD of the differences, ICC) EDV ?3.0 ± 11.6?ml, 0.937; SV 3.4 ± 9.8?ml, 0.855; and EF 3.5 ± 5.1%, 0.586. Although LV mass was consistently overestimated (29.9 ± 17.0?g, 0.534) due to larger epicardial contours on all slices, linear regression could be used to correct the bias and improve accuracy. Automated InlineVF results can be used for case-control studies in UK Biobank, provided visual quality control and linear bias correction are performed. Improvements between InlineVF D13A and InlineVF E11C show the field is rapidly advancing, with further improvements expected in the near future. ? 2017, The Author(s).",Automated analysis; UK Biobank; Ventricular function,"biobank; calibration; case control study; correlation coefficient; epicardium; female; heart ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle mass; heart stroke volume; human; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; validation process; aged; algorithm; automation; cine magnetic resonance imaging; comparative study; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; heart disease; heart stroke volume; middle aged; observer variation; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; statistical model; United Kingdom; validation study; Aged; Algorithms; Automation; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke Volume; United Kingdom; Ventricular Function, Left",2-s2.0-85027983046

In addition to being discriminatory, these beliefs cause anxiety that can affect learning in the clinical environment. A review of an undergraduate nursing curriculum introduced the Modern Apprenticeship curriculum model and provided an opportunity for an educational intervention designed to address stigmatizing beliefs about people with mental health and addiction problems. The aim of the present study was to measure the extent to which an educational intervention – guided clinical experience in an acute mental health unit during the first year of the curriculum – decreased stigmatizing beliefs of undergraduate nurses towards those with mental health and addiction issues. In a before-and-after design, Corrigan's Attribution Questionnaire was used to collect data pre- and post-guided clinical experience in an acute mental health unit. The intervention resulted in a significant positive change in stigmatizing attitudes for four of the nine factors tested. There was a non-significant positive change in three factors, while two factors showed a non-significant negative change. Using guided clinical experience as an educational intervention in the first year of an undergraduate nursing curriculum can contribute to positive change in undergraduate nurses’ stigmatizing beliefs. The findings have implications for teaching of mental health content in undergraduate nursing programmes. ? 2017 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.",clinical practice; educational intervention; mental health; Modern Apprenticeship; stigma; undergraduate nurse,"adolescent; adult; curriculum; drug dependence; education; female; health personnel attitude; human; male; mental disease; middle aged; nursing; nursing student; psychiatric nursing; psychology; social stigma; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Curriculum; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Psychiatric Nursing; Social Stigma; Students, Nursing; Substance-Related Disorders; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85014619344

There is growing opinion that addressing the global burden of diet-related disease requires a much more comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach than stand-alone public health nutrition interventions such as nutrition education or food labelling. Instead, we need to develop whole of systems interventions to address the core problem and consider the way we grow, process, distribute and commercialize our food. However, there is little evidence or guidance on how to best achieve this goal. This research aims to develop a whole of food systems approach for public health nutrition research by building on systems methods from other fields of science. Specific objectives are to: 1) identify systems methods that are applicable to public health nutrition research; 2) identify how these systems methods and public health research can best be integrated. Methods/results: We explored a range of systems methods which could potentially be applied to public health nutrition research. Based on these, we developed a framework for using and combining different systems methods in public health nutrition research. The framework consists of three main phases: A) availability and affordability of (un)healthy food; B) determinants of (un)healthy food availability and affordability; and C) food system intervention development. Phase A forms the platform of this research combining a series of smaller projects examining food availability, affordability and healthiness. Phase B uses global value chain analysis (GVCA) to identify different attributes of value, including both health and monetary values. Phase C aims to identify sustainable food system public health interventions using Group Model Building (GMB) and logistic modelling approaches. Conclusion: This paper presents why and how systems methods can be used in public health nutrition research. The food system is highly complex and this complexity needs to be acknowledged to find solutions for the current nutrition challenges (obesity, under nutrition), which cannot be solved in isolation. We envision that the methods presented in this paper can form the basis for future research in this area where it can be applied to other public health nutrition research (for example other food products, in relation to specific diseases, different countries) as well as other domains of a sustainable food system not specifically focused on here e.g. economic, social and specific environmental outcomes. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Food policy; Food system; Public health nutrition; Sustainability; Value chain analysis,analytical method; complexity; diet; food availability; food consumption; food policy; geographical research; interdisciplinary approach; logistics; nutrition; obesity; project assessment; public health; sustainability; valuation,2-s2.0-85009739468

Epistasis describes the non-linear, synergistic interaction of two or more genetic loci, which can substantially modify disease severity or result in entirely new phenotypes. The concept has remained controversial in human genetics because of the lack of well-characterized examples. In humans, it is only possible to demonstrate epistasis if two or more genes are mutated. In most cases of epistasis, the mutated gene products are likely to be constituents of the same physiological pathway leading to severe disruption of a cellular function such as antibody production. We have recently described a digenic family, who carry mutations of TNFRSF13B/TACI as well as TCF3 genes. Both genes lie in tandem along the immunoglobulin isotype switching and secretion pathway. We have shown they interact in an epistatic way causing severe immunodeficiency and autoimmunity in the digenic proband. With the advent of next generation sequencing, it is likely other families with digenic inheritance will be identified. Since digenic inheritance does not always cause epistasis, we propose an epistasis index which may help quantify the effects of the two mutations. We also discuss the clinical implications of digenic inheritance and epistasis in humans with primary immunodeficiency disorders. ? 2018 Ameratunga, Woon, Bryant, Steele, Slade, Leung and Lehnert.",Common variable immunodeficiency disorders; Digenic mutation; Epistasis; Monogenic syndromes; Primary immunodeficiency disorder,immunoglobulin class; transcription factor 7 like 1; transmembrane activator and CAML interactor; antibody production; Article; autoimmunity; cell function; digenic inheritance; disease severity; DNA structure; epistasis; experimental animal; gene locus; genetic variation; human; immune deficiency; immunoglobulin production; inheritance; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; penetrance; secretory pathway,2-s2.0-85041132887

Here, we use data from a series of cell proliferation assays, with a prostate cancer cell line, to calibrate a spatially continuous individual based model (IBM) of collective cell migration and proliferation. The IBM explicitly accounts for crowding effects by modifying the rate of movement, direction of movement, and the rate of proliferation by accounting for pair-wise interactions. Taking a Bayesian approach we estimate the free parameters in the IBM using rejection sampling on three separate, independent experimental data sets. Since the posterior distributions for each experiment are similar, we perform simulations with parameters sampled from a new posterior distribution generated by combining the three data sets. To explore the predictive power of the calibrated IBM, we forecast the evolution of a fourth experimental data set. Overall, we show how to calibrate a lattice-free IBM to experimental data, and our work highlights the importance of interactions between individuals. Despite great care taken to distribute cells as uniformly as possible experimentally, we find evidence of significant spatial clustering over short distances, suggesting that standard mean-field models could be inappropriate. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Approximate Bayesian computation; Cell migration; Cell proliferation assay; Individual based model; Model calibration,"Bayesian analysis; calibration; cell organelle; experimental study; individual-based model; Article; Bayes theorem; cell migration; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell spreading; cellular distribution; controlled study; human; human cell; individualization; mathematical computing; mathematical model; priority journal; algorithm; biological model; cell proliferation; computer simulation; physiology; time factor; tumor cell line; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Computer Simulation; Humans; Models, Biological; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85032814110

To address this, we compared the immune responses of influenza-confirmed hospitalized individuals with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) to those of nonhospitalized individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI). Methods. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected from 27 patients with ILI and 27 with SARI, at time of enrollment and then 2 weeks later. Innate and adaptive cellular immune responses were assessed by flow cytometry, and serum cytokine levels were assessed by a bead-based assay. Results. During the acute phase, SARI was associated with significantly reduced numbers of circulating myeloid dendritic cells, CD192+ monocytes, and influenza virus-specific CD8+ and CD4+ T cells as compared to ILI. By the convalescent phase, however, most SARI cases displayed continued immune activation characterized by increased numbers of CD16+ monocytes and proliferating, and influenza virus-specific, CD8+ T cells as compared to ILI cases. SARI was also associated with reduced amounts of cytokines that regulate T-cell responses (ie, interleukin 4, interleukin 13, interleukin 12, interleukin 10, and tumor necrosis factor ?) and hematopoiesis (interleukin 3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) but increased amounts of a proinflammatory cytokine (tumor necrosis factor ?), chemotactic cytokines (MDC, MCP-1, GRO, and fractalkine), and growth-promoting cytokines (PDGFBB/AA, VEGF, and EGF) as compared to ILI. Severe influenza cases showed a delay in the peripheral immune activation that likely led prolonged inflammation, compared with mild influenza cases. ? 2018 The Author(s).",cellular immunity; cytokine.; disease severity; infection; Influenza,"chemokine receptor CCR2; cytokine; fractalkine; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 3; interleukin 4; lymphotoxin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; vasculotropin; cytokine; Article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; female; flow cytometry; hematopoiesis; human; human cell; immune response; influenza; innate immunity; lymphocyte proliferation; male; monocyte; myeloid dendritic cell; peripheral lymphocyte; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; virus reactivation; adaptive immunity; adolescent; adult; aged; blood; cellular immunity; child; dendritic cell; immunology; inflammation; influenza; innate immunity; lymphocyte; middle aged; pathology; young adult; Adaptive Immunity; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Cohort Studies; Cytokines; Dendritic Cells; Female; Humans; Immunity, Cellular; Immunity, Innate; Inflammation; Influenza, Human; Lymphocytes; Male; Middle Aged; Monocytes; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85040587466

We aimed to quantify the attributes of dialysis care and the tradeoffs that patients consider when making decisions about dialysis modalities. Design, setting, participants, & measurements We conducted a prospective, discrete choice experiment survey with random parameter log it analysis to quantify preferences and tradeoffs for attributes of dialysis treatment in 143 adult patients with CKD expected to require RRT within 12 months (predialysis). The attributes included schedule flexibility, patient out of pocket costs, subsidized transport services, level of nursing support, life expectancy, dialysis training time, wellbeing on dialysis, and dialysis schedule (frequency and duration). We reported outcomes using b-coefficients with corresponding odds ratios and 95%confidence intervals for choosing home-based dialysis (peritoneal dialysis or hemo dialysis) compared with facility hemodialysis. Results Home-based therapies were significantly preferred with the following attributes: longer survival (odds ratio per year, 1.63; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 2.12), increased treatment flexibility (odds ratio, 9.22; 95% confidence interval, 2.71 to 31.3), improved wellbeing (odds ratio, 210; 95% confidence interval, 15 to 2489), and more nursing support (odds ratio, 87.3; 95%confidence interval, 3.8 to 2014). Respondents were willing to accept additional out of pocket costs of approximatelyNewZealand*400 (United States *271)per month(95%confidence interval, New Zealand *333 to *465) to receive increased nursing support. Patients were willing to accept out of pocket costs of New Zealand *223 (United States *151) per month (95%confidence interval, New Zealand *195 to *251) for more treatment flexibility. Conclusions Patients preferred home dialysis over facility-based care when increased nursing support was available and when longer survival, wellbeing, and flexibility were expected.

We sought to determine whether the efficacy of cangrelor during PCI varies in patients with simple vs. complex target lesion coronary anatomy. Methods and results Blinded angiographic core laboratory analysis was completed in 10 854 of 10 942 (99.2%) randomized patients in CHAMPION PHOENIX (13 418 target lesions). Outcomes were analysed according to the number of angiographic PCI target lesion high-risk features (HRF) present (bifurcation, left main, thrombus, angulated, tortuous, eccentric, calcified, long, or multi-lesion treatment). The number of patients with 0, 1, 2, and ?3 HRFs was 1817 (16.7%), 3442 (31.7%), 2901 (26.7%), and 2694 (24.8%), respectively. The 48-h MACE rate in clopidogrel-treated patients increased progressively with lesion complexity (from 3.3% to 4.4% to 6.9% to 8.7%, respectively, P < 0.0001). Cangrelor reduced the 48-h rate of MACE by 21% {4.7% vs. 5.9%, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (95% CI)] 0.79 (0.67, 0.93), P = 0.006} compared with clopidogrel, an effect which was consistent regardless of PCI lesion complexity (Pinteraction = 0.66) and presentation with stable ischaemic heart disease (SIHD) or an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). By multivariable analysis, the number of high-risk PCI characteristics [OR (95% CI) 1.68 (1.20, 2.36), 2.78 (2.00, 3.87), and 3.23 (2.33, 4.48) for 1, 2, and 3 HRFs compared with 0 HRFs, all P < 0.0001] and treatment with cangrelor vs. clopidogrel [OR (95% CI) 0.78 (0.66, 0.92), P = 0.004] were independent predictors of the primary 48-h MACE endpoint. Major bleeding rates were unrelated to lesion complexity and were not increased by cangrelor. Conclusion Peri-procedural MACE after PCI is strongly dependent on the number of treated high-risk target lesion features. Compared with a loading dose of clopidogrel, cangrelor reduced MACE occurring within 48 h after PCI in patients with SIHD and ACS regardless of baseline lesion complexity. The absolute benefit:risk profile for cangrelor will therefore be greatest during PCI in patients with complex coronary anatomy. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Adenosine diphosphate receptor antagonist; Cangrelor; Clopidogrel; Complex lesion; Prognosis; Stent,"cangrelor; clopidogrel; adenosine phosphate; cangrelor; clopidogrel; purinergic P2Y receptor antagonist; acute coronary syndrome; adult; Article; bleeding; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary angiography; disease course; drug effect; drug efficacy; enzyme inhibition; female; human; ischemic heart disease; laboratory technique; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; male; middle aged; percutaneous coronary intervention; predictor variable; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; adverse event; aged; clinical trial; dose response; double blind procedure; follow up; heart muscle ischemia; incidence; intravenous drug administration; multicenter study; percutaneous coronary intervention; perioperative period; postoperative complication; procedures; retrospective study; risk factor; survival rate; United States; Adenosine Monophosphate; Aged; Clopidogrel; Coronary Angiography; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Incidence; Infusions, Intravenous; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Ischemia; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Perioperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Purinergic P2Y Receptor Antagonists; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; United States",2-s2.0-85058551246

The mechanism of this restriction is poorly understood, but it has recently been suggested to involve recruitment of components of the autophagy machinery, including members of the mammalian autophagy-related 8 (ATG8) family involved in targeting proteins to the autophagosome. To better understand the molecular details of this interaction, here we utilized analytical ultracentrifugation to characterize the binding of six ATG8 isoforms and determined the crystal structure of the Trim5 Bbox coiled-coil region in complex with one member of the mammalian ATG8 proteins, autophagy-related protein LC3 B (LC3B). We found that Trim5 binds all mammalian ATG8s and that, unlike the typical LC3-interacting region (LIR) that binds to mammalian ATG8s through a -strand motif comprising approximately six residues, LC3B binds to Trim5 via the -helical coiled-coil region. The orientation of the structure demonstrated that LC3B could be accommodated within a Trim5 assembly that can bind the retroviral capsid. However, mutation of the binding interface does not affect retroviral restriction. Comparison of the typical linear -strand LIR with our atypical helical LIR reveals a conservation of the presentation of residues that are required for the interaction with LC3B. This observation expands the range of LC3B-binding proteins to include helical binding motifs and demonstrates a link between Trim5 and components of the autophagosome. ? 2018 Keown et al.",,"autophagy related protein; autophagy related protein 8 family; autophagy related protein LC3; tripartite motif protein 5; unclassified drug; autophagy related protein 8 family; carrier protein; GABARAPL2 protein, human; MAP1LC3B protein, human; microtubule associated protein; protein binding; TRIM5 protein, human; alpha helix; animal cell; Article; autophagosome; beta sheet; crystal structure; mammal; nonhuman; priority journal; protein assembly; protein binding; protein family; protein interaction; protein motif; Retroviridae; size exclusion chromatography; ultracentrifugation; virus capsid; autophagy; chemistry; genetics; HeLa cell line; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; virology; Amino Acid Motifs; Autophagy; Autophagy-Related Protein 8 Family; Carrier Proteins; HeLa Cells; HIV; HIV Infections; Humans; Microtubule-Associated Proteins; Protein Binding",2-s2.0-85057074635

First, with the transformer oil-paper insulation system (TOPIS) as the target of evaluation and the winding hot spot temperature (HST) as the core point, an HST-based static ageing failure model is built according to the Weibull distribution and Arrhenius reaction law, in order to describe the transformer ageing process and calculate the winding HST for obtaining the failure rate and life expectancy of TOPIS. A grey target theory based dynamic correction model is then developed, combined with the data of Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA) in power transformer oil, in order to dynamically modify the life expectancy calculated by the built static model, such that the corresponding relationship between the state grade and life expectancy correction coefficient of TOPIS can be built. Furthermore, the life expectancy loss recovery factor is introduced to correct the life expectancy of TOPIS again. Lastly, a practical case study of an operating transformer has been undertaken, in which the failure rate curve after introducing dynamic corrections can be obtained for the reliability assessment of this transformer. The curve shows a better ability of tracking the actual reliability level of transformer, thus verifying the validity of the proposed method and providing a new way for transformer reliability assessment. This contribution presents a novel model for the reliability assessment of TOPIS, in which the DGA data, as a source of information for the dynamic correction, is processed based on the grey target theory, thus the internal faults of power transformer can be diagnosed accurately as well as its life expectancy updated in time, ensuring that the dynamic assessment values can commendably track and reflect the actual operation state of the power transformers. ? 2018 by the authors.

Research priorities are difficult to determine, often relying on individual interests or prior work. Objective To identify the research priorities of paediatric emergency medicine (PEM) specialists working in Australia and New Zealand. Methods Online surveys were administered in a two-stage, modified Delphi study. Eligible participants were PEM specialists (consultants and senior advanced trainees in PEM from 14 PREDICT sites). Participants submitted up to 3 of their most important research questions (survey 1). Responses were collated and refined, then a shortlist of refined questions was returned to participants for prioritisation (survey 2). A further prioritisation exercise was carried out at a PREDICT meeting using the Hanlon Process of Prioritisation. This determined the priorities of active researchers in PEM including an emphasis on the feasibility of a research question. Results One hundred and six of 254 (42%) eligible participants responded to survey 1 and 142/245 (58%) to survey 2. One hundred and sixty-eight (66%) took part in either or both surveys. Two hundred forty-six individual research questions were submitted in survey 1. Survey 2 established a prioritised list of 35 research questions. Priority topics from both the Delphi and Hanlon process included high flow oxygenation in intubation, fluid volume resuscitation in sepsis, imaging in cervical spine injury, intravenous therapy for asthma and vasopressor use in sepsis. Conclusion This prioritisation process has established a list of research questions, which will inform multicentre PEM research in Australia and New Zealand. It has also emphasised the importance of the translation of new knowledge. ? Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2018.

We analyzed the data using correlation, regression, and exploratory factor analysis. Results: All included well-being measures demonstrated high loadings on the global well-being construct that explains about 80% of the variance in the OHQ, the psychological domain of Quality of Life and subjective well-being. The results show high positive correlations between happiness, psychological and health domains of quality of life, life satisfaction, and positive affect. Social and environmental domains of quality of life were poor predictors of happiness and subjective well-being after controlling for psychological quality of life. Conclusion: Together, these data provide support for a global well-being dimension and interchangeable use of terms happiness, subjective well-being, and psychological quality of life with the current sample and measures. Further investigation with larger heterogeneous samples and other well-being measures is warranted. ? 2018 Medvedev and Landhuis.",Happiness; Life satisfaction; Measurement; Quality of life; Well-being,article; controlled study; exploratory factor analysis; happiness; human; human experiment; life satisfaction; major clinical study; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; quality of life; questionnaire; Satisfaction with Life Scale; university student; wellbeing; world health organization,2-s2.0-85048123896

Tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (Tdp1) is one of the DNA repair system enzymes involved in the removal of DNA damages caused by topoisomerase I inhibitors. Thus, reducing the activity of Tdp1 can increase the effectiveness of currently used anticancer drugs. We describe here a new class of semisynthetic small molecule Tdp1 inhibitors based on the bile acid scaffold that were originally identified by virtual screening. The influence of functional groups of bile acids (hydroxy and acetoxy groups in the steroid framework and amide fragment in the side chain) on inhibitory activity was investigated. In vitro studies demonstrate the ability of the semisynthetic derivatives to effectively inhibit Tdp1 with IC50 up to 0.29 ?M. Furthermore, an excellent fit is realized for the ligands when docked into the active site of the Tdp1 enzyme. ? 2018 by the authors.",Amide; Cancer; Chenodeoxycholic acid; Deoxycholic acid; Molecular modelling; Tdp1 inhibitor; Tumor; Ursodeoxycholic acid; Virtual screening,"bile acid; nicotinamide; phosphodiesterase; phosphodiesterase inhibitor; tryptamide; tryptamine derivative; tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase; analogs and derivatives; binding site; chemistry; HCT 116 cell line; human; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; molecular docking; preclinical study; synthesis; Bile Acids and Salts; Binding Sites; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; HCT116 Cells; Humans; MCF-7 Cells; Molecular Docking Simulation; Niacinamide; Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors; Phosphoric Diester Hydrolases; Tryptamines",2-s2.0-85044436142

We report changes in major stroke types and IS subtypes incidence during 10 years using data from the ARCOS (Auckland Regional Community Stroke Study) III performed during 12 months in 2002 to 2003 and the fourth ARCOS study (ARCOS-IV) performed in 2011 to 2012. Methods-ARCOS-III and ARCOS-IV were population-based registers of all new strokes in the greater Auckland region (population aged >15 years, 1 119 192). Strokes were classified into major pathological types (IS, ICH, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and undetermined type). Crude annual age-, sex-, and ethnic-specific stroke incidence with 95% confidence intervals was calculated. ISs were subclassified using TOAST (Trial of ORG 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria into 5 etiologic groups. Rate ratios with 95% confidence intervals were calculated for differences in age-standardized rates between the 2 studies. Results-In ARCOS-IV, there were 1329 (81%) ISs, 211 (13%) ICHs, 79 (5%) subarachnoid hemorrhages, and 24 (1%) undetermined type strokes. The proportional distribution of IS subtypes was 29% cardioembolism, 21% small-vessel occlusion, 15% large-artery atherosclerosis, 5% other determined etiology, and 31% undetermined type. Between 2002 and 2011, age-standardized incidence decreased for subarachnoid hemorrhage (rate ratios, 0.73; 95% confidence intervals, 0.54-0.99) and undetermined type (rate ratios, 0.14; 95% confidence intervals, 0.09-0.22). Rates were stable for IS and ICH. Among IS subtypes, large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel occlusion rates increased significantly. The frequency of all risk factors increased in IS. Ethnic differences were observed for both stroke subtype rates and their risk factor frequencies. Conclusions-A lack of change in IS and ICH incidence may reflect a trend toward increased incidence of younger strokes. Increased rates of large-artery atherosclerosis and small-vessel occlusion are associated with increased smoking and high blood pressure. Ethnic differences in the proportional distribution of pathological stroke subtypes suggest differential exposure and susceptibility to risk factors. ? 2017 American Heart Association, Inc.",Arteries; Incidence; Risk factors; Smoking; Subarachnoid hemorrhage,"cholesterol; adolescent; adult; age; aged; Asian; blood pressure; blood vessel occlusion; brain atherosclerosis; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cardioembolic stroke; cerebrovascular accident; cholesterol blood level; diabetes mellitus; ethnic difference; European; female; heart infarction; human; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); New Zealand; onset age; Pacific Islander; priority journal; Review; risk factor; sex difference; smoking; subarachnoid hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; incidence; middle aged; multicenter study; register; retrospective study; risk factor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Ischemia; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stroke",2-s2.0-85043724231

Sex hormones influence neovascularisation during pregnancy. However the profiling of estrogen and progesterone in preeclampsia is controversial. In this study we investigated the serum levels of estrogen and progesterone in women with preeclampsia. Blood samples were collected from 86 preeclamptic and 97 gestation-matched normotensive pregnancies. The levels of 17β-estradiol (E2), progesterone and 2-methoxyestradiol (2-ME) in serum were measured. In addition, the levels of E2 and progesterone in conditioned media from preeclamptic or normotensive term placental explant cultures or placental explants that had been treated with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) were measured. The expression of estrogen receptors (ER) and progesterone receptors (PR) in preeclamptic and control placentae were measured by immunohistochemistry. The serum levels of E2, progesterone and 2-ME were significantly reduced in women with preeclampsia compared to controls. There was no difference in the serum levels of E2 and progesterone between severe and mild or between early-onset and late-onset preeclampsia as well as between preeclampsia with and without fetal growth restriction (FGR). The levels of E2 and progesterone in preeclamptic placental explants cultures were significantly lower than in normotensive term placental explant cultures. Treatment with H2O2 was found to be associated with a reduction in E2 production by the placenta. We demonstrated lower levels of estrogen in preeclampsia and speculate that this reduction may be due to the impairment of placental function in preeclampsia. ? 2017 International Society for the Study of Hypertension in Pregnancy",Estrogen; Oxidative stress; Preeclampsia; Progesterone; Severity of preeclampsia; Time of onset of preeclampsia,"2 methoxyestradiol; estradiol; estrogen; estrogen receptor; hydrogen peroxide; progesterone; progesterone receptor; 2-methoxyestradiol; 3-nitrotyrosine; biological marker; estradiol; estrogen receptor; hydrogen peroxide; progesterone; progesterone receptor; tyrosine; adult; Article; blood sampling; disease association; estrogen blood level; female; gestational age; human; immunohistochemistry; intrauterine growth retardation; major clinical study; preeclampsia; pregnant woman; priority journal; progesterone blood level; protein expression; analogs and derivatives; blood; case control study; conditioned medium; down regulation; drug effect; intrauterine growth retardation; metabolism; pathophysiology; placenta; preeclampsia; pregnancy; severity of illness index; tissue culture technique; young adult; Adult; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Culture Media, Conditioned; Down-Regulation; Estradiol; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Placenta; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Progesterone; Receptors, Estrogen; Receptors, Progesterone; Severity of Illness Index; Tissue Culture Techniques; Tyrosine; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85043370342

With this approach we aimed to alter the pharmacological properties of the complexes and address issues with the aqueous solubility of the analogous p-cymene complexes. The complexes were shown to be stable in DMSO and water and reacted readily with l-histidine and 9-ethylguanine as protein and DNA models, respectively. Assaying the antiproliferative activity in cancer cells gave IC50 values in the low μM range.

Clinical practice guidelines point to the need for regular monitoring of depression symptom severity and the emergence of suicidal ideation to track treatment progress and guide intervention delivery. Yet, this is seldom integrated in clinical practice. Objective: The objective of this study was to address the gap between guidelines about monitoring and real-world practice by codesigning an app with young people that allows for self-monitoring of mood and communication of this monitoring with a clinician. Methods: We engaged young people aged 18 to 25 years who had experienced depression, suicidal ideation including those who self-harm, as well as clinicians in a codesign process. We used a human-centered codesign design studio methodology where young people designed the features of the app first individually and then as a group. This resulted in a minimal viable product design, represented through low-fidelity hand-drawn wireframes. Clinicians were engaged throughout the process via focus groups. Results: The app incorporated a mood monitoring feature with innovative design aspects that allowed customization, and was named a ""well-being tracker"" in response to the need for a positive approach to this function. Brief personalized interventions designed to support young people in the intervals between face-To-face appointments were embedded in the app and were immediately available via pop-ups generated by a back-end algorithm within the well-being tracker. Issues regarding the safe incorporation of alerts generated by the app into face-To-face clinical services were raised by clinicians (ie, responding in a timely manner) and will need to be addressed during the full implementation of the app into clinical services. Conclusions: The potential to improve outcomes for young people via technology-based enhancement to interventions is enormous. Enhancing communication between young people and their clinicians about symptoms and treatment progress and increasing access to timely and evidence-based interventions are desirable outcomes. To achieve positive outcomes for young people using technology-(app) based interventions, it is critical to understand and incorporate, in a meaningful way, the expectations and motivations of both young people and clinicians.",Adolescent; Attempted; Cell phone; Depression; Self-injurious behavior; Suicidal ideation; Suicide; Young adult,,2-s2.0-85041044483

Rates of decisions to treat, plus disease grading, ROP stage grading, ROP zone grading, inter-observer variation within groups and intra-observer variation within groups were measured.ResultsForty-two eye examinations were graded.

ANZ ophthalmologists diagnosed stage 2 ROP more frequently than UK ophthalmologists, 20.2 (5.8) compared to 12.7 (7.1) eye examinations, P=0.026. There were no other significant differences in the grading of ROP stage or zone. Inter-observer variation was higher within the UK group than within the ANZ group. Intra-observer variation was low in both groups.ConclusionsWe have found evidence of international variation in the diagnosis of treatment-requiring ROP. Improved standardisation of the diagnosis of treatment-requiring ROP is required.

Methods: Psychosocial stress was assessed by a questionnaire in 14?577 patients (median age 65.0, IQR 59, 71; 81.6% males) with stable CHD on optimal secondary preventive therapy in the prospective randomized STABILITY clinical trial. Adjusted Cox regression models were used to assess associations between individual stressors, baseline cardiovascular risk factors and outcomes. Results: After 3.7?years of follow-up, depressive symptoms, loss of interest and financial stress were associated with increased risk (hazard ratio, 95% confidence interval) of CV death (1.21, 1.09–1.34; 1.15, 1.05–1.27; and 1.19, 1.08–1.30, respectively) and the primary composite end-point of CV death, nonfatal MI or nonfatal stroke (1.21, 1.13–1.30; 1.19, 1.11–1.27; and 1.17, 1.10–1.24, respectively).

Methods Using anonymous patient-linkage of routinely collected data, all New Zealanders aged 35-84 years who experienced an International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems I(CD)-coded IHD hospitalisation and/or IHD death between 1 January 2005 and 31 December 2015 were identified. A 10-year look-back period was used to differentiate those experiencing first from recurrent events. Age-standardised hospitalisation and mortality rates were calculated for each calendar year and trends compared by sex and age. Results 160 109 people experienced at least one IHD event (259 678 hospitalisations and 35 548 deaths) over the 11-year study period, and there was a steady decline in numbers (from almost 24 000 in 2005 to just over 16 000 in 2015) and in age-standardised rates each year. With the exception of deaths in younger (35-64 years) women with prior IHD, there was a significant decline in IHD events in men and women of all ages, with and without a history of IHD. The decline in IHD mortality was greater for those experiencing a first rather than recurrent IHD event (3.8%-5.2% vs 0%-3.7% annually on average). In contrast, the decline in IHD hospitalisations was greater for those experiencing a recurrent compared with a first IHD event (5.6%-7.3% vs 3.2%-5.7% annually on average). Conclusions The substantial decline in IHD hospitalisations and mortality observed in New Zealanders with and without prior IHD between 2005 and 2015 suggests that primary and secondary prevention efforts have been effective in reducing the occurrence of IHD events. ? 2018 Article author(s).",,"adult; age; aged; Article; disease severity; female; hospitalization; human; International Classification of Diseases; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; New Zealand; priority journal; recurrent disease; sex difference; trend study; age distribution; forecasting; heart muscle ischemia; middle aged; morbidity; New Zealand; prognosis; recurrent disease; register; retrospective study; risk assessment; sex ratio; trends; very elderly; Adult; Age Distribution; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Forecasting; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Myocardial Ischemia; New Zealand; Prognosis; Recurrence; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Sex Distribution; Sex Factors",2-s2.0-85038221112

Improvements in the tear lipid layer, inferior lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE), cylindrical collarettes, and MMP-9 expression were limited to the dedicated eyelid cleanser (all p &lt; 0.05), and a greater decrease in SANDE symptoms score was also observed (p = 0.04). Meibomian gland capping and MUC5AC expression worsened with baby shampoo treatment (both p &lt; 0.05). SPEED symptoms score, superior LWE, seborrhoeic lash crusting, and trichiasis decreased significantly following application of both treatments (all p &lt; 0.05), but did not differ between treatments (all p &gt; 0.05). Conclusion Clinical improvements in blepharitis occurred with both treatments. However, only the dedicated eyelid cleanser proved effective in reducing ocular surface inflammation, and was the preferred therapy.

We hypothesised that increasing contralesional excitability with anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (a-tDCS) would benefit motor performance in patients with moderate-severe impairment. Methods Ten patients with motor impairment at the chronic stage after stroke received a-tDCS, cathodal (c-tDCS) and sham with the target electrode over contralesional motor cortex (M1). Motor performance was quantified from the circularity and size of planar movements made with the paretic arm. Contralateral and ipsilateral corticospinal excitability was inferred using transcranial magnetic stimulation. Corticospinal tract integrity and basal GABA concentration were assessed with magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy. Results Anodal tDCS increased contralesional corticomotor excitability evident from motor evoked potentials in both wrist extensors (both P < 0.043). Cathodal tDCS did not affect corticomotor excitability (P > 0.37). The effect of tDCS on motor performance with the paretic limb was negatively associated with ipsilesional GABA concentration after c-tDCS (P = 0.001). Conclusions Further investigation of noninvasive brain stimulation protocols that facilitate contralesional M1 is warranted.

Silver ions are commonly incorporated into wound dressing to enhance the antimicrobial property. However, concerns have been expressed about the development of bacterial resistance to heavy metals. In this study, we evaluate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of cellulose nanocrystal film to be used as antimicrobial drug delivery system in a diabetic wound dressing. Cellulose nanocrystals were successfully isolated from medical grade cotton fibers. We observe needle-like cellulose nanocrystals with an average length of 159?nm under transmission electron microscope. The developed film with curcumin shows a uniform yellow color, with a thickness of 0.4?mm. The film obtained is soft and flexible, based on the mechanical characterization study of the film. For the curcumin release test, the release reaches plateau condition at 36?h with a total release of 98.9% from the cellulose nanocrystal film. No burst release effect was detected during the test period. The film exhibited significant inhibitory activity on 3 Gram positive bacteria, 2 Gram negative bacteria and 1 yeast. On Hohenstein challenge test, all test microorganisms showed significant growth reduction, with the treatment of curcumin loaded film. 5 of 6 test microorganisms showed 99% of growth reduction relative to growth control. We also notice that the antimicrobial activity of the film sustained even after 15 washes. In the in vivo study using diabetic rat models, a significant reduction of wound size was observed from Day 7 with the topical application of curcumin loaded film. At the end of the study, the lesion was covered by epithelial tissue and the hair started to grow from the skin. A bacterial growth reduction of 99.99% was observed from the skin sample excised from the animal models. The histological examination of skin sample also showed that curcumin loaded film significantly improved the regeneration of hair follicles and sebaceous glands of the skin. Our results indicate that the curcumin load cellulose nanocrystal films can be used for diabetic wound healing applications. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Antimicrobial activity; Cellulose nanocrystal; Curcumin; Diabetic wound ulcer,Bacteria; Cellulose; Cellulose derivatives; Cellulose films; Diseases; Heavy metals; Metal ions; Microorganisms; Nanocrystals; Testing; Transmission electron microscopy; Anti-microbial activity; Anti-microbial properties; Cellulose nano-crystals; Curcumin; Diabetic wounds; Gram-positive bacterium; Histological examination; Mechanical characterizations; Film growth,2-s2.0-85033490739

The development of small molecule inhibitors was once an accepted “one-size fits all” approach to these varied problems, but persistence and resistance threaten to return society to a pre-antibiotic era. Only five essential cellular targets in bacteria have been developed for the majority of our clinically-relevant antibiotics. These include: cell wall synthesis, cell membrane function, protein and nucleic acid biosynthesis, and antimetabolites. Many of these targets are now compromised through rapidly spreading antimicrobial resistance and the need to target non-replicating cells (persisters). Recently, an unprecedented medical breakthrough was achieved by the FDA approval of the drug bedaquiline (BDQ, trade name Sirturo) for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis disease. BDQ targets the membrane-bound F1Fo-ATP synthase, validating cellular energy generating machinery as a new target space for drug discovery. Recently, BDQ and several other FDA-approved drugs have been demonstrated to be respiratory “uncouplers” disrupting transmembrane electrochemical gradients, in addition to binding to enzyme targets. In this review, we summarize the role of bioenergetic systems in mycobacterial persistence and discuss the multi-targeting nature of uncouplers and the place these molecules may have in future drug development. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Antimicrobials; Bacteria; Bioenergetics; Drug discovery; Respiration,"antiinfective agent; antimetabolite; menaquinone; quinone derivative; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; bacterial protein; bedaquiline; proton transporting adenosine triphosphatase; quinoline derivative; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase (ubiquinone); tuberculostatic agent; uncoupling protein; bacterial growth; breathing; cell membrane; electrochemical analysis; electron; electron transport; energy transfer; enzyme binding; metabolism; molecular dynamics; Mycobacterium; nonhuman; nucleic acid synthesis; priority journal; respiratory chain; Review; antagonists and inhibitors; drug design; drug development; drug effect; energy metabolism; human; membrane potential; microbiology; molecularly targeted therapy; multidrug resistance; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; physiology; procedures; Antitubercular Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Cell Membrane; Diarylquinolines; Drug Design; Drug Discovery; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Electron Transport Complex I; Energy Metabolism; Humans; Membrane Potentials; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Proton-Translocating ATPases; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant; Uncoupling Agents",2-s2.0-85033391433

One proposed pathway for this association has been differential exposure to accumulated risk factors in children of lower SES. The aim of the current study was to investigate the socioeconomic distribution of exposure to negative life events and family stress and to examine the direct and interactive association between lower SES and exposure to life events and family stress in relation with mental health problems. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from the second wave of the Bergen Child Study (conducted in 2006), the current study investigated the association between lower SES and exposure to negative life events, family life stressors, and mental health problems in a sample of 2043 Norwegian 11–13 years and their parents. Information about mental health was self-reported by the children using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, whereas information about SES and exposure to negative life events and family stressors were provided by their parents. Results: The findings showed that lower SES was associated with more symptoms of emotional-, conduct-, hyperactivity/inattention-, and peer problems and that exposure to life events and family stress explained some of this association (10–29% of the total effects). Conclusions: Low SES and higher prevalence of negative life events and family stressors were associated with more symptoms of mental health problems. Overall, the effect sizes were smaller than previous investigations (f2s = 0.015–0.031), perhaps suggesting a buffering effect of the social safety net in place in Norway. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Bergen Child Study; Cumulative stress; Mental health; SES,"adolescent; anxiety; child; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; emotion; female; human; income; life event; male; mental disease; mental health; mental stress; Norway; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; social class; socioeconomics; Adolescent; Anxiety; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Emotions; Female; Humans; Income; Life Change Events; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Norway; Parents; Risk Factors; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85032655595

However, UNHS also frequently detects children with mild loss that results in many receiving early treatment. The benefits of this approach are not yet established. We aimed to (i) compare language and psychosocial outcomes between four hearing loss detection systems for children aged 5–8?years with congenital mild–moderate hearing loss; (ii) determine whether age of detection predicts outcomes; and (iii) compare outcomes between children identified via well-established UNHS and the general population. Methods: Linear regression adjusted for potential confounding factors was used throughout. Via a quasi-experimental design, language and psychosocial outcomes were compared across four population-based Australian systems of hearing loss detection: opportunistic detection, born 1991–1993, n?=?50; universal risk factor referral, born 2003–2005, n?=?34; newly established UNHS, born 2003–2005, n?=?41; and well-established UNHS, born 2007–2010, n?=?21. In pooled analyses, we examined whether age of detection predicted outcomes. Outcomes were similarly compared between the current well-established UNHS system and typically developing children in the Early Language in Victoria Study, born 2003, n?=?1217. Results: Age at diagnosis and hearing aid fitting fell steadily across the four systems. For moderate losses, mean expressive language (P for trend.05) and receptive vocabulary (P for trend.06) improved across the four systems, but benefit was not obvious for mild losses. In pooled analyses, diagnosis before age six months predicted better language outcomes for moderate losses. Children with mild–moderate losses exposed to well-established UNHS continue to experience expressive language scores well below children in the general population (adjusted mean difference??8.9 points, 95% CI ?14.7 to ?3.1). Conclusions: Treatment arising from UNHS appears to be clearly benefitting children with moderate hearing losses. However, rigorous trials are needed to quantify benefits, versus costs and potential harms, of early aiding of children with mild losses. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",child development; delayed language; health services research; hearing impairment; sensori–neural deafness,adverse device effect; Australia; child; comparative study; cost benefit analysis; economics; female; hearing aid; hearing impaired person; hearing impairment; hearing test; human; language; language development; longitudinal study; male; pathophysiology; procedures; program evaluation; prosthetic fitting; quality of life; risk factor; speech perception; statistical model; Australia; Child; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Hearing Aids; Hearing Loss; Hearing Tests; Humans; Language; Language Development; Linear Models; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Persons With Hearing Impairments; Program Evaluation; Prosthesis Fitting; Quality of Life; Risk Factors; Speech Perception,2-s2.0-85020666868

Cerebral ischemia is a condition that arises from a sudden loss of blood flow and consequent failure to meet the high metabolic demands of the brain. The lack of blood flow initiates a sequelae of cell death mechanisms, including the activation of the inflammatory pathway, which can ultimately result in irreversible brain tissue damage. In particular, Connexins and Pannexins are non-selective channels with a large pore that have shown to play time-dependent roles in the perpetuation of ischaemic injury. This review highlights the roles of Connexin and Pannexin channels in cell death mechanisms as a promising therapeutic target in cerebral ischemia, and in particular connexin hemichannels which may contribute most of the ATP release as a result of ischemia as well as during reperfusion.

From a single objective point of view, this problem, known as the beam angle optimization (BAO) problem, is solved by finding a beam angle configuration (BAC) that leads to the best dose distribution, according to some objective function. As there exists a trade-off between the main goals in IMRT (to irradiate the tumor according to some prescription and to avoid surrounding healthy tissue), it makes sense to solve this problem from a multiobjective (MO) point of view. When doing so, a solution of the BAO problem is no longer a single BAC, but instead a set of BACs that lead to a set of dose distributions that, depending on both dose prescription and physician preferences, can be selected as the preferred treatment. We solve this MO problem using a two-phase strategy. During the first phase, a deterministic local search algorithm is used for selecting a set of locally optimal BACs, according to a single-objective function. During this search, an optimal dose distribution for each BAC, with respect to the single-objective function, is calculated using an exact nonlinear programming algorithm. During the second phase, a set of nondominated points is generated for each promising locally optimal BAC and a dominance analysis among them is performed. The output of the procedure is a set of (approximately) efficient BACs that lead to good dose distributions. To demonstrate the viability of the method, the two-phase strategy is applied to a prostate case. ? 2016 The Authors.

HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the Huntingtin (HTT) gene, translating to an elongated glutamine tract in the huntingtin protein. The pathogenic mechanism resulting in cell dysfunction and death beyond the causative mutation is not well defined. To further delineate the early molecular events in HD, we performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) on striatal tissue from a cohort of 5-y-old OVT73-line sheep expressing a human CAG-expansion HTT cDNA transgene. Our HD OVT73 sheep are a prodromal model and exhibit minimal pathology and no detectable neuronal loss. We identified significantly increased levels of the urea transporter SLC14A1 in the OVT73 striatum, along with other important osmotic regulators. Further investigation revealed elevated levels of the metabolite urea in the OVT73 striatum and cerebellum, consistent with our recently published observation of increased urea in postmortem human brain from HD cases. Extending that finding, we demonstrate that postmortem human brain urea levels are elevated in a larger cohort of HD cases, including those with low-level neuropathology (Vonsattel grade 0/1). This elevation indicates increased protein catabolism, possibly as an alternate energy source given the generalized metabolic defect in HD. Increased urea and ammonia levels due to dysregulation of the urea cycle are known to cause neurologic impairment. Taken together, our findings indicate that aberrant urea metabolism could be the primary biochemical disruption initiating neuropathogenesis in HD.",Huntington's disease; Metabolism; Prodromal; Sheep; Urea,"ammonia; complementary DNA; huntingtin; urea; HTT protein, human; huntingtin; urea; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cerebellum; controlled study; corpus striatum; energy resource; female; gene expression; human; human tissue; Huntington chorea; male; metabolite; neuropathology; nonhuman; osmosis; priority journal; protein degradation; RNA sequence; striate cortex; transgenic sheep; adult; animal; disease model; genetics; Huntington chorea; metabolism; pathology; sheep; transgenic animal; trinucleotide repeat; Adult; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Corpus Striatum; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Humans; Huntingtin Protein; Huntington Disease; Male; Sheep; Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion; Urea",2-s2.0-85039700622

The Problem Gambling Severity Index identified 19.7% [CI = 17.0-22.4] as ""non-problem gamblers,"" 7.2% [CI = 5.4-8.9] as ""low-risk"" gamblers, 8.4% [CI = 6.5-10.2] as ""moderate-risk"" gamblers, and 6.3% [CI = 4.7-8.0] as ""problem gamblers."" One-fifth (21.9%) of the sample and 52.6% of all gamblers were identified as either low-risk, moderate-risk, or problem gamblers (PGs). Patients classified as problem and moderaterisk gamblers had significantly elevated rates of nicotine and illicit drug dependence (p < .001) according to short screening tools. Current diagnosis of drug use (OR = 4.31 [CI = 1.98-9.37]), borderline personality (OR = 2.59 [CI = 1.13-5.94]), bipolar affective (OR = 2.01 [CI = 1.07-3.80]), and psychotic (OR = 1.83 [CI = 1.03-3.25]) disorders were significant predictors of problem gambling. Discussion and conclusions: Patients were less likely to gamble, but eight times as likely to be classified as PG, relative to Victoria's adult general population. Elevated rates of harmful substance use among moderate-risk and PG suggest overlapping vulnerability to addictive behaviors. These findings suggest mental health services should embed routine screening into clinical practice, and train clinicians in the management of problem gambling. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Alcohol; Illicit drugs; Mental health; Nicotine; Problem gambling,"illicit drug; nicotine; adult; aged; alcoholism; anxiety disorder; Article; bipolar disorder; borderline state; depression; disease severity; drug dependence; female; health survey; human; intermediate risk population; low risk population; major clinical study; male; mental health service; pathological gambling; psychosis; tobacco dependence; Victoria; anxiety disorder; Australia; bipolar disorder; comorbidity; drug dependence; gambling; major depression; middle aged; prevalence; psychosis; statistical model; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Australia; Bipolar Disorder; Community Mental Health Services; Comorbidity; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Gambling; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Psychotic Disorders; Substance-Related Disorders; Victoria",2-s2.0-85039804858

This study investigated the longitudinal course and prevalence of cognitive impairment in an incidence cohort, identifying factors associated with declining cognition. Methods: Two hundred fifty-seven participants (mean age = 67.93 ± 13.59) of first-ever stroke survivors, completed cognitive assessments within 2 weeks post stroke, and/or 1, 6, 12, and 48-month. Multivariate linear and logistic models were used to identify baseline predictors (reported as OR with 95% CI) and trajectory of cognitive impairment. Results: Cognitive functioning significantly declined by 2.8 points by 4 years post stroke. Eighty-four percent of stroke survivors had cognitive impairment indicative of post-stroke dementia (mean Montreal cognitive assessment = 20 ± 4.7) at 4-year. There were significant as-sociations between progressive cognitive decline and the-following factors: male gender (OR 2.9, 95% CI 1.6-5.9,-p = 0.0171), coronary artery disease (OR 2.96, 95% CI 1.35-6.49, p = 0.0070), arrhythmia (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.07-4.57, p = 0.0317), not in a relationship (OR 2.8, 95% CI 1.4-5.50, p < 0.0001), and not employed (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.9-12.1, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Cognitive deficits remain highly prevalent at 4-year post stroke. Early identification of those at higher risk of declining cognition is vital to target rehabilitation interventions at the acute stage and improve overall outcomes. ? 2017 S.

Objective and Methods: To determine the relationship between variations in DNA methylation at birth and the development of allergic disease, we examined the methylation status of CpG loci within the promoter regions of Th1/2 lineage commitment genes (GATA3, IL-4, IL-4R, STAT4 and TBET) in umbilical cord DNA at birth in a cohort of infants from the Southampton Women's Survey (n?=?696) who were later assessed for asthma, atopic eczema and atopy. Results: We found that higher methylation of GATA3 CpGs ?2211/?2209 at birth was associated with a reduced risk of asthma at ages 3 (median ratio [median methylation in asthma group/median methylation in non-asthma group]?=?0.74, P?=.006) and 6-7 (median ratio 0.90, P?=.048) years. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the GATA3 CpG loci associated with later risk of asthma lie within a NF-κB binding site and that methylation here blocks transcription factor binding to the GATA3 promoter in the human Jurkat T-cell line. Associations between umbilical cord methylation of CpG loci within IL-4R with atopic eczema at 12?months (median ratio 1.02, P?=.028), and TBET with atopy (median ratio 0.98, P?=.017) at 6-7?years of age were also observed. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: Our findings provide further evidence of a developmental contribution to the risk of later allergic disorders and suggest that involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in childhood asthma is already demonstrable at birth. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",biomarkers; GATA3; Methylation; TBET; Th1/Th2,"interleukin 4; interleukin 4 receptor; STAT4 protein; transcription factor GATA 3; transcription factor T bet; GATA3 protein, human; protein binding; transcription factor GATA 3; adult; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; atopy; cell lineage; child; childhood; clinical outcome; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; female; gene locus; human; human cell; infant; Jurkat cell line; major clinical study; preschool child; priority journal; promoter region; school child; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; age; atopic dermatitis; binding site; case control study; cell lineage; genetic predisposition; genetics; hypersensitivity; immunology; metabolism; onset age; Th2 cell; umbilical cord; Age Factors; Age of Onset; Binding Sites; Case-Control Studies; Cell Lineage; Child; Child, Preschool; CpG Islands; Dermatitis, Atopic; DNA Methylation; GATA3 Transcription Factor; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein Binding; Th2 Cells; Umbilical Cord",2-s2.0-85035078099

Research outcomes suggest that greater reported purpose is related to a range of better health and well-being outcomes for older adults. With few exceptions, the literature demonstrates that purpose declines with age. Nevertheless, the potential to experience purpose persists across the life span, by providing opportunities for older adults to continue contributing roles, participate in meaningful activities, and sustain their social value and sense of relevance.

Normal fat mass is a size descriptor that partitions total body mass into fat-free mass and fat mass calculated from total body mass minus fat-free mass. The relative influence of fat mass compared with fat-free mass is described by the fraction of fat mass that makes fat equivalent to fat-free mass in terms of allometric size.

The lipophilic PCAs 1–4 showed cytotoxicity in the low micromolar range and 6 was the most potent compound of the series with an IC50 value of 1.1 μM against HCT116 colon cancer cells. These observations were correlated with calculated octanol/water partition coefficient (clogP) data and quantitative estimated druglikeness. A similar trend as for the PCAs was found in their Ru complexes, where the complexes with more lipophilic ligands proved to be more cytotoxic in all tested cell lines. In general, the PCAs and their organoruthenium derivatives demonstrated excellent drug-likeness and cytotoxicity with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, making them interesting candidates for further development as orally active anticancer agents. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Anticancer activity; Bioorganometallics; Oral anticancer agents; Organoruthenium compounds; Pyridine-2-carbothiamide ligands,"2 pyridinecarbothioamide derivative; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic metal complex; chloride; ligand; n (4 acetylphenyl)pyridine 2 carbothioamide; n [4 (dimethylamino)phenyl]pyridine 2 carbothioamide; octanol; ruthenium; unclassified drug; water; antineoplastic agent; coordination compound; pyridine derivative; thioamide; Article; cytotoxicity; electrospray mass spectrometry; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; lipophilicity; NCI-H460 cell line; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; SiHa cell line; structure activity relation; SW480 cell line; X ray diffraction; chemical phenomena; chemistry; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Coordination Complexes; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Ligands; Pyridines; Ruthenium; Structure-Activity Relationship; Thioamides",2-s2.0-85029149190

Athletes 18 years of age (or older) who were members of the High Performance Sport New Zealand programme were invited to participate. Of 370 potential participants, 187 completed responses were received (51%). Symptoms of depression were measured by the Centre for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale—Revised (CESD-R). Life stress was measured by the Daily Hassles Questionnaire. Results Overall 21% (n = 39) of participants reported symptoms consistent with depression. Only 2 of the 39 athletes were currently taking an anti-depressant medication. Those contemplating retirement, partaking in individual sport, and who were less than 25 years old had significantly increased odds of experiencing depression. Reported life stressors were higher in females, in those who play an individual sport and those in a centralised programme. There was a significant correlation between higher levels of life stress and experiencing depressive symptoms. Conclusions This study highlights that depressive symptoms are prevalent in elite athletes with multiple potential risk factors identified including high life stress.

Although women with a previous spontaneous preterm birth (SPTB) are considered at high risk for recurrence, the majority occur in women without prior history. Prediction of SPTB risk allows for improved care and potential for targeting novel and existing therapeutics to prevent SPTB, which may result in improved outcomes for infant and mother. In this pilot study, a miRNA array was used to analyse plasma from healthy women in their first pregnancy at 20 weeks of gestation who then went on to deliver either at term or experience SPTB at 28-32 weeks. We identified specific miRNA expression profiles that differentiated between those mothers who delivered at term or delivered following SPTB. miR302b, miR1253 and a clustering of miR548 miRNAs were underexpressed in SPTB cases compared to term controls. Conversely, miR223 was elevated in mothers that later experienced a SPTB. The circulating miRNAs identified in the present study may therefore be attractive candidates as non-invasive biomarkers for the early prediction of SPTB. Further larger studies are now warranted to investigate the potential clinical utility of these markers. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,biological marker; microRNA; adult; blood; clinical trial; female; human; multicenter study; pilot study; pregnancy; prematurity; Adult; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; MicroRNAs; Pilot Projects; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimesters; Premature Birth,2-s2.0-85018784331

Analyses of guidelines published before 2010 found that many did not offer GI tools. Since 2010 standards, frameworks and instructions for GI tools have emerged. This study analyzed the number and types of GI tools offered by guidelines published in 2010 or later. Methods: Content analysis and a published GI tool framework were used to categorize GI tools by condition, country, and type of organization. English-language guidelines on arthritis, asthma, colorectal cancer, depression, diabetes, heart failure, and stroke management were identified in the National Guideline Clearinghouse. Screening and data extraction were in triplicate. Findings were reported with summary statistics. Results: Eighty-five (67.5%) of 126 eligible guidelines published between 2010 and 2017 offered one or more of a total of 464 GI tools. The mean number of GI tools per guideline was 5.5 (median 4.0, range 1 to 28) and increased over time. The majority of GI tools were for clinicians (239, 51.5%), few were for patients (113, 24.4%), and fewer still were to support implementation (66, 14.3%) or evaluation (46, 9.9%). Most clinician GI tools were guideline summaries (116, 48.5%), and most patient GI tools were condition-specific information (92, 81.4%). Government agencies (patient 23.5%, clinician 28.9%, implementation 24.1%, evaluation 23.5%) and developers in the UK (patient 18.5%, clinician 25.2%, implementation 27.2%, evaluation 29.1%) were more likely to generate guidelines that offered all four types of GI tools. Professional societies were more likely to generate guidelines that included clinician GI tools. Conclusions: Many guidelines do not include any GI tools, or a variety of GI tools for different stakeholders that may be more likely to prompt guideline uptake (point-of-care forms or checklists for clinicians, decision-making or self-management tools for patients, implementation and evaluation tools for managers and policy-makers). While this may vary by country and type of organization, and suggests that developers could improve the range of GI tools they develop, further research is needed to identify determinants and potential solutions. Research is also needed to examine the cost-effectiveness of various types of GI tools so that developers know where to direct their efforts and scarce resources. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Content analysis; Guideline implementation tools; Guidelines; Implementation,"chronic disease; colorectal tumor; cost benefit analysis; economics; education; global health; government; health care personnel; human; medical society; organization and management; practice guideline; protocol compliance; Chronic Disease; Colorectal Neoplasms; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Global Health; Government Agencies; Guideline Adherence; Health Personnel; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Societies, Medical",2-s2.0-85034602118

The majority of stillbirths in this setting occur in women without established risk factors. Identification of risk factors which could be identified and managed in pregnancy is a priority in stillbirth prevention research. This study aimed to evaluate women's experiences of fetal movements and how these relate to stillbirth. Methods: An international internet-based case-control study of women who had a stillbirth ?28 weeks' gestation within 30 days prior to completing the survey (n = 153) and women with an ongoing pregnancy or a live born child (n = 480). The online questionnaire was developed with parent stakeholder organizations using a mixture of categorical and open-ended responses and Likert scales. Univariate and multiple logistic regression was used to determine crude (unadjusted) and adjusted odds ratios (aOR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Summative content analysis was used to analyse free text responses. Results: Women whose pregnancy ended in stillbirth were less likely to check fetal movements (aOR 0.54, 95% CI 0.35-0.83) and were less likely to be told to do so by a health professional (aOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.36-0.86). Pregnancies ending in stillbirth were more frequently associated with significant abnormalities in fetal movements in the preceding two weeks; this included a significant reduction in fetal activity (aOR 14.1, 95% CI 7.27-27.45) or sudden single episode of excessive fetal activity (aOR 4.30, 95% CI 2.25-8.24). Cases described their perception of changes in fetal activity differently to healthy controls e.g. vigorous activity was described as ""frantic"", ""wild"" or ""crazy"" compared to ""powerful"" or ""strong"". Conclusions: Alterations in fetal activity are associated with increased risk of stillbirth. Pregnant women should be educated about awareness of fetal activity and reporting abnormal activity to health professionals. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Exaggerated fetal movement; Fetal movement; Maternal perception; Reduced fetal movement; Stillbirth,Article; case control study; cohort analysis; content analysis; controlled study; female; fetus; fetus movement; health care organization; human; informed consent; Likert scale; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; population research; practice guideline; questionnaire; risk factor; stillbirth; adult; gestational age; international cooperation; odds ratio; perception; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal care; psychology; statistical model; stillbirth; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Fetal Movement; Gestational Age; Humans; Internationality; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Perception; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Care; Risk Factors; Stillbirth; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85033801342

Prominent among MA-PM interactions is electrostatic attraction between the positively charged MA domain and the negatively charged plasma membrane inner leaflet. Previously, we reported that membrane association of HIV-1 Gag, as well as purified Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) MA and Gag, depends strongly on the presence of acidic lipids and is enhanced by cholesterol (Chol). The mechanism underlying this enhancement was unclear. Here, using a broad set of in vitro and in silico techniques we addressed molecular mechanisms of association between RSV MA and model membranes, and investigated how Chol enhances this association. In neutron scattering experiments with liposomes in the presence or absence of Chol, MA preferentially interacted with preexisting POPS-rich clusters formed by nonideal lipid mixing, binding peripherally to the lipid headgroups with minimal perturbation to the bilayer structure. Molecular dynamics simulations showed a stronger MA-bilayer interaction in the presence of Chol, and a large Chol-driven increase in lipid packing and membrane surface charge density. Although in vitro MA-liposome association is influenced by disparate variables, including ionic strength and concentrations of Chol and charged lipids, continuum electrostatic theory revealed an underlying dependence on membrane surface potential. Together, these results conclusively show that Chol affects RSV MA-membrane association by making the electrostatic potential at the membrane surface more negative, while decreasing the penalty for lipid headgroup desolvation. The presented approach can be applied to other viral and nonviral proteins. ? 2017 Biophysical Society",,1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylglycero-3-phosphoserine; 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine; cholesterol; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylserine; protein binding; solvent; viral protein; animal; cell membrane; chemistry; lipid bilayer; metabolism; molecular dynamics; protein conformation; protein domain; Rous sarcoma virus; static electricity; Animals; Cell Membrane; Cholesterol; Lipid Bilayers; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Phosphatidylcholines; Phosphatidylserines; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Domains; Retroviridae Proteins; Rous sarcoma virus; Solvents; Static Electricity,2-s2.0-85032887614

Women who are unable to maintain their blood glucose concentration within pre-specified treatment targets with diet and lifestyle interventions will require anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies. This review explores the safety and effectiveness of insulin compared with oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies, non-pharmacological interventions and insulin regimens. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of insulin in treating women with gestational diabetes. Search methods: We searched Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (1 May 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 May 2017) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (including those published in abstract form) comparing: a) insulin with an oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy; b) with a non-pharmacological intervention; c) different insulin analogues; d) different insulin regimens for treating women with diagnosed with GDM. We excluded quasi-randomised and trials including women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, risk of bias, and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results: We included 53 relevant studies (103 publications), reporting data for 7381 women. Forty-six of these studies reported data for 6435 infants but our analyses were based on fewer number of studies/participants. Overall, the risk of bias was unclear; 40 of the 53 included trials were not blinded. Overall, the quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality. The primary reasons for downgrading evidence were imprecision, risk of bias and inconsistency. We report the results for our maternal and infant GRADE outcomes for the main comparison. Insulin versus oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy For the mother, insulin was associated with an increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (not defined) compared to oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy (risk ratio (RR) 1.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.14 to 3.12; four studies, 1214 women; moderate-quality evidence). There was no clear evidence of a difference between those who had been treated with insulin and those who had been treated with an oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy for the risk of pre-eclampsia (RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.52; 10 studies, 2060 women; moderate-quality evidence); the risk of birth by caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.14; 17 studies, 1988 women; moderate-quality evidence); or the risk of developing type 2 diabetes (metformin only) (RR 1.39, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.44; two studies, 754 women; moderate-quality evidence). The risk of undergoing induction of labour for those treated with insulin compared with oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy may possibly be increased, although the evidence was not clear (average RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.75; three studies, 348 women; I2 = 32%; moderate-quality of evidence). There was no clear evidence of difference in postnatal weight retention between women treated with insulin and those treated with oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy (metformin) at six to eight weeks postpartum (MD -1.60 kg, 95% CI -6.34 to 3.14; one study, 167 women; low-quality evidence) or one year postpartum (MD -3.70, 95% CI -8.50 to 1.10; one study, 176 women; low-quality evidence). The outcomes of perineal trauma/tearing or postnatal depression were not reported in the included studies. For the infant, there was no evidence of a clear difference between those whose mothers had been treated with insulin and those treated with oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies for the risk of being born large-for-gestational age (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.35; 13 studies, 2352 infants; moderate-quality evidence); the risk of perinatal (fetal and neonatal death) mortality (RR 0.85; 95% CI 0.29 to 2.49; 10 studies, 1463 infants; low-quality evidence);, for the risk of death or serious morbidity composite (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.26; two studies, 760 infants; moderate-quality evidence); the risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia (average RR 1.14, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.52; 24 studies, 3892 infants; low-quality evidence); neonatal adiposity at birth (% fat mass) (mean difference (MD) 1.6%, 95% CI -3.77 to 0.57; one study, 82 infants; moderate-quality evidence); neonatal adiposity at birth (skinfold sum/mm) (MD 0.8 mm, 95% CI -2.33 to 0.73; random-effects; one study, 82 infants; very low-quality evidence); or childhood adiposity (total percentage fat mass) (MD 0.5%; 95% CI -0.49 to 1.49; one study, 318 children; low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence also found no clear differences between groups for rates of neurosensory disabilities in later childhood: hearing impairment (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.01 to 7.49; one study, 93 children), visual impairment (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.03 to 2.90; one study, 93 children), or any mild developmental delay (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.33 to 3.44; one study, 93 children). Later infant mortality, and childhood diabetes were not reported as outcomes in the included studies. We also looked at comparisons for regular human insulin versus other insulin analogues, insulin versus diet/standard care, insulin versus exercise and comparisons of insulin regimens, however there was insufficient evidence to determine any differences for many of the key health outcomes. Please refer to the main results for more information about these comparisons. Authors' conclusions: The main comparison in this review is insulin versus oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies. Insulin and oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies have similar effects on key health outcomes. The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate, with downgrading decisions due to imprecision, risk of bias and inconsistency. For the other comparisons of this review (insulin compared with non-pharmacological interventions, different insulin analogies or different insulin regimens), there is insufficient volume of high-quality evidence to determine differences for key health outcomes. Long-term maternal and neonatal outcomes were poorly reported for all comparisons. The evidence suggests that there are minimal harms associated with the effects of treatment with either insulin or oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies. The choice to use one or the other may be down to physician or maternal preference, availability or severity of GDM. Further research is needed to explore optimal insulin regimens. Further research could aim to report data for standardised GDM outcomes. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Study design We analyzed data from 227 infants with hypoglycemia (blood glucose <46.8 mg/dL, 2.6 mmol/L) born at a tertiary hospital who experienced 295 episodes of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose concentrations were measured (glucose oxidase) within 90 minutes after randomization to dextrose or placebo gel plus feeding with formula, expressed breast milk, or breast feeding. Results The overall mean increase in blood glucose concentration was 11.7 mg/dL (95% CI 10.4-12.8). The increase was greater after buccal dextrose gel than after placebo gel (+3.0 mg/dL; 95% CI 0.7-5.3; P =.01) and greater after infant formula than after other feedings (+3.8 mg/dL; 95% CI 0.8-6.7; P =.01). The increase in blood glucose concentration was not affected by breast feeding (+2.0 mg/dL; 95% CI ?0.3 to 44.2; P =.09) or expressed breast milk (?1.4 mg/dL; 95% CI ?3.7 to 0.9; P =.25). However, breast feeding was associated with reduced requirement for repeat gel treatment (OR = 0.52; 95% CI 0.28-0.94; P =.03). Conclusions Treatment of infants with hypoglycemia with dextrose gel or formula is associated with increased blood glucose concentration and breast feeding with reduced need for further treatment. Dextrose gel and breast feeding should be considered for first-line oral treatment of infants with hypoglycemia. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",feeding; infant; infant of a diabetic mother; newborn; preterm; treatment,"glucose; glucose oxidase; placebo; glucose; Article; artificial milk; breast feeding; breast milk expression; controlled study; female; gel; glucose blood level; human; hypoglycemia; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; clinical trial; drug effects; glucose blood level; hypoglycemia; New Zealand; newborn disease; oral drug administration; register; Administration, Oral; Blood Glucose; Female; Glucose; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Infant; Infant Formula; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Male; New Zealand; Registries",2-s2.0-85022066870

Tranexamic acid (TXA) has been shown to reduce perioperative blood loss in total knee arthroplasty (TKA). However, questions over its optimal route of administration remain. Methods A double-blinded, placebo, multicentered, randomized, controlled trial investigating the efficacy of topical and systemic routes of a single intraoperative dose (1.5 g) of TXA was conducted. Patients undergoing primary, unilateral TKA were screened for eligibility. Eligible patients were consecutively enrolled from 5 New Zealand centers between July 2014 and November 2015. Three prospective groups running in parallel (topical TXA [tTXA], systemic TXA [sTXA], and placebo) were investigated for a primary outcome of estimated perioperative blood loss. An intention-to-treat analysis was used to compare outcomes between the study groups (P value <.05). Results One hundred and thirty-four patients across the 5 hospitals were recruited into the study. Estimated blood loss was equivalent in the 2 treatment groups, sTXA (749 mL [95% confidence interval, 637-860]) and tTXA (723 mL [620-826]). Compared to the placebo group (1090 mL [923-1257]), blood loss was significantly lower in both treatment groups (P =.001 and P =.0003, respectively). There were no significant differences in secondary outcomes, including rates of symptomatic deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism (P =.759). Conclusion In the setting of elective TKA, a single 1.5-g dose of tTXA given intraoperatively either systemically or topically effectively reduces blood loss without an increase in complications. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",blood transfusion; estimated blood loss; perioperative care; total knee arthroplasty; TRACKS; tranexamic acid,"placebo; tranexamic acid; anesthetic agent; antifibrinolytic agent; tranexamic acid; aged; Article; controlled study; deep vein thrombosis; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; female; human; knee surgery; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; operative blood loss; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial; intention to treat analysis; intraoperative period; knee; knee replacement; length of stay; middle aged; New Zealand; operative blood loss; perioperative period; postoperative period; Aged; Anesthetics; Antifibrinolytic Agents; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Blood Loss, Surgical; Cardiovascular Diseases; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Intention to Treat Analysis; Intraoperative Period; Knee; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Perioperative Period; Postoperative Period; Prospective Studies; Tranexamic Acid",2-s2.0-85021780980

Methods: Addresses from about 20,000 registered food outlets were retrieved from all 66 Councils. Outlets were classified, geocoded and (spatially) validated. The analysis included 4087 convenience, 4316 fast food/takeaway and 1271 supermarket and fruit/vegetable outlets and excluded outlets not considered ‘healthy’ or ‘unhealthy’. The population-weighted density of different outlet types in Census areas and the proximity to different outlet types from Meshblock centres were calculated and associations with area socioeconomic deprivation assessed. Spatial scan statistics was used to identify food swamp areas with a significantly higher relative density of unhealthy outlets than other areas. Results: A significantly positive association was observed between area deprivation and density of all retailers. A significantly negative association was observed between area deprivation and proximity to all retailers. Nationwide, 722 Census areas were identified as food swamps. Conclusions: Access to food retailers is significantly higher in more deprived areas than in less deprived areas. Restricting unhealthy outlets in areas with a high relative density of those outlets is recommended. ? 2017, Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+).",Area socioeconomic deprivation; Community retail food environments; Food swamps,catering service; commercial phenomena; cross-sectional study; demography; environment; fast food; human; New Zealand; poverty; spatial analysis; statistics and numerical data; Commerce; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environment; Fast Foods; Food Supply; Humans; New Zealand; Poverty Areas; Residence Characteristics; Restaurants; Spatial Analysis,2-s2.0-85019961341

Methods: As part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes cohort study, PA and SB (sitting and television times) were assessed by interviewer-administered questionnaire. During 75 g oral glucose tolerance tests at 26-28 weeks' gestation we measured FG, 2hPG levels and GDM (FG ? 7.0 mmol/L and/or 2hPG ? 7.8 mmol/L). Associations were analysed by multiple linear and logistic regression. Results: Among the 1083 women studied, 18.6% had GDM. SB was not associated with FG, 2hPG and GDM. Higher categories of PA were associated with lower 2hPG and a lower likelihood of GDM (p-trend &lt; 0.05), but not with FG levels. Compared to insufficiently active women, highly active women had lower 2hPG levels [β (95% CI): -0.32 (-0.59, -0.05), p = 0.020) and were less likely to have GDM [OR: 0.56 (0.32-0.98), p = 0.040]. Stratified analysis revealed no associations among under/normal-weight women, but significant associations among overweight/obese women; in those with BMI ?23 kg/m2, sufficiently active and highly active women were less likely to have GDM [OR: 0.52, (0.29-0.93), p = 0.028, and OR: 0.34, (0.15-0.77), p = 0.010, respectively]. Conclusion: Higher PA was associated with lower 2hPG levels and a lower prevalence of GDM, particularly in overweight/obese women. Further studies are warranted to confirm these findings, and to examine the effectiveness of PA promotion strategies for the prevention of gestational hyperglycemia. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Gestational diabetes mellitus; Maternal glucose levels; Physical activity; Pregnancy; Sedentary behavior,"glucose; adult; Article; Asian; body mass; body weight; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; controlled study; diet restriction; disease association; female; gestational age; glucose blood level; health promotion; human; interview; major clinical study; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; physical activity; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; prevalence; questionnaire; sedentary lifestyle; Singapore; sitting; trend study; analysis; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; complication; diet restriction; exercise; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; physiology; postprandial state; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; risk factor; second trimester pregnancy; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Glucose; Cohort Studies; Diabetes, Gestational; Exercise; Fasting; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Overweight; Postprandial Period; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Risk Factors; Sedentary Lifestyle; Singapore",2-s2.0-85032874637

Maximal uptake of tea antioxidants and milk proteins without a negative impact on tea flavor is highly desired by consumers. There is a conflicting evidence of the effect of milk addition to tea on antioxidant activity. Differences in the type of tea, the composition, type and amount of milk, preparation method of tea–milk infusions, the assays used to measure antioxidant activity, and sampling size likely account for different findings. Interactions between tea polyphenols and milk proteins, especially between catechins and caseins, could account for a decrease in antioxidant activity, although other mechanisms are also possible, given the similar effects between soy and bovine milk. The role of milk fat globules and the milk fat globule membrane surface is also important when considering interactions and loss of polyphenolic antioxidant activity, which has not been addressed in the literature. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",antioxidant activity; bioavailability; chemical interactions; milk fat globules; milk proteins; Polyphenols,Agents; Biochemistry; Flavonoids; Oils and fats; Proteins; Anti-oxidant activities; bioavailability; Chemical interactions; Milk fat globules; Milk protein; Polyphenols; Antioxidants; antioxidant; casein; catechin; polyphenol; animal; bovine; chemistry; human; lipid peroxidation; milk; tea; Animals; Antioxidants; Caseins; Catechin; Cattle; Humans; Lipid Peroxidation; Milk; Polyphenols; Tea,2-s2.0-85019584149

This so called “leptin resistance” is not well understood, and solving this puzzle is a key to understanding how obesity develops. In the present study, we investigated the temporal and regional onset of leptin resistance in response to a diet enriched with long-chain saturated fatty acids (high-fat diet; HFD) in mice. Mice were exposed to either a low-fat diet (LFD) or a HFD for 4?hours, 24?hours, 10?days and 28?days. Mice in each group received an i.p. injection of either phosphate-buffered saline or leptin and the number of phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription-3 (pSTAT3) immunoreactive (-IR) cells in the arcuate nucleus (ARC), ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH) and dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH) was analysed 30 or 120?minutes after treatment. In the ARC, as soon as 24?hours of HFD, the molecular leptin response was reduced by 40% (P?.01). Compared to at 24?hours, after 10?days, the number of leptin-induced pSTAT3-IR cells was elevated after 120?minutes, suggesting a sustained response and a partial return of leptin sensitivity. After 28?days, leptin failed to induce the number of pSTAT3-IR over control levels, suggesting a markedly reduced sensitivity to leptin. In the VMH after 24?hours, we observed a 50% reduction in leptin-induced pSTAT-3-IR cells, followed by a further decline after 10?days. However, after 28?days, there was a significant increase in pSTAT-3-IR cells (P?.05), indicating partial recovery of leptin sensitivity. By contrast to these two regions, in the DMH, no loss of leptin sensitivity was observed at any time-point. These findings demonstrate that a loss of sensitivity to leptin occurs rapidly after exposure to HFD in the ARC and VMH but not the DMH. However, there appears to be a biphasic pattern of leptin responsiveness, with a partial return of leptin sensitivity occurring after 10?days in the arcuate nucleus, and after 28?days in the VMH. By 28?days, the response to leptin in the arcuate nucleus was completely lost. These findings suggest that the molecular responses to leptin are altered after high-fat feeding in a time- and region-specific manner. ? 2017 British Society for Neuroendocrinology",arcuate nucleus; high-fat diet; hypothalamus; inflammation,"leptin; phosphate buffered saline; STAT3 protein; leptin; STAT3 protein; Stat3 protein, mouse; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; arcuate nucleus; Article; body weight; controlled study; diet induced obesity; fat intake; hormone resistance; hormone response; hormone sensitivity; hypothalamus ventromedial nucleus; immunoreactivity; leptin resistance; low fat diet; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; animal; C57BL mouse; disease model; dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus; hypothalamus; lipid diet; metabolism; obesity; phosphorylation; Animals; Arcuate Nucleus of Hypothalamus; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Dorsomedial Hypothalamic Nucleus; Hypothalamus; Leptin; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Phosphorylation; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Ventromedial Hypothalamic Nucleus",2-s2.0-85032870380

Methods and results In 15 828 patients from the STABILITY trial (darapladib vs. placebo in patients with established coronary heart disease), BP variability was assessed by the standard deviation (SD) of systolic BP, the SD of diastolic BP, maximum BP, and minimum BP, from 5 measurements (baseline and months 1, 3, 6, and 12) during the first year after randomisation. Mean (SD) average BP during the first year of study was 131.0 (13.7) mmHg over 78.3 (8.3) mmHg. Mean (SD) of the visit-to-visit SD was 9.8 (4.8) mmHg for systolic and 6.3 (3.0)mmHg for diastolic BP. During the subsequent median follow-up of 2.6 years, 1010 patients met the primary endpoint, a composite of time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In Cox regression models adjusted for average BP during first year of study, baseline vascular disease, treatment, renal function and cardiovascular risk factors, the primary endpoint was associated with SD of systolic BP (hazard ratio for highest vs. lowest tertile, 1.30, 95% CI 1.10-1.53, P = 0.007), and with SD of diastolic BP (hazard ratio for highest vs. lowest tertile, 1.38, 95% CI 1.18-1.62, P < 0.001). Peaks and troughs in BP were also independently associated with adverse events. Conclusion In patients with stable coronary heart disease, higher visit-to-visit variabilities of both systolic and diastolic BP are strong predictors of increased risk of cardiovascular events, independently of mean BP.",Coronary heart disease; STABILITY trial; Visit-to-visit variability of blood pressure,darapladib; placebo; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; blood pressure variability; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; disease association; female; follow up; heart infarction; heart muscle revascularization; human; ischemic heart disease; kidney function; major clinical study; male; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; blood pressure; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; comparative study; coronary artery disease; diastole; double blind procedure; mortality; multicenter study; pathophysiology; physiology; prognosis; systole; Aged; Blood Pressure; Coronary Disease; Diastole; Double-Blind Method; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Prognosis; Stroke; Systole,2-s2.0-85030776106

Compared with 'always overweight/obese' children, odds of 'resolving overweight/obese' were lower with higher maternal BMI (OR 0.87, CI 0.78 to 0.97), and higher with better child physical health (OR 1.06, CI 1.02 to 1.10) and higher maternal age (OR 1.11, CI 1.01 to 1.22) and education (OR 4.07, CI 1.02 to 16.19). Conclusions: Readily available baseline information (child/maternal BMI, maternal age, education and child health) were the strongest predictors of both onset and resolution of overweight/obesity between the primary school and adolescent years. Perinatal, breastfeeding and lifestyle exposures were not strongly predictive. Results could stimulate development of algorithms identifying children most in need of targeted prevention or treatment. ?

Mindfulness-based interventions appear promising amongst cancer survivors, but scant research has been conducted amongst patients undergoing acute treatment. This trial compared the efficacy of a brief mindfulness-based intervention (bMBT) with relaxation therapy on reducing distress amongst chemotherapy patients. Sixty-eight people receiving first-line chemotherapy at Auckland City Hospital were randomised to bMBT (n?=?32) or relaxation training groups (n?=?36). In both conditions, participants attended three 90-min weekly sessions. Overall distress (distress thermometer (DT); impact thermometer (IT)), cancer-related stress (Impact Events Scale–Cancer (IES-C)), cancer symptom distress (Memorial Symptom Assessment Scale–Short Form (MSAS-SF)) and social avoidance (SA) were assessed at enrolment, post-intervention and at 3-month follow-up. Both groups reported reductions in overall and cancer-related stress over time. Immediately post-intervention, however, bMBT (but not relaxation training) participants reported increased symptom distress, marginally increased social avoidance and decreased quality of life. So whilst overall distress and cancer distress declined in both groups, the mindfulness intervention was associated with increased symptom distress and social avoidance and reduced quality of life. This report presents a randomised controlled trial of a mindfulness-based intervention during chemotherapy and suggests that care is needed in employing mindfulness-based interventions in acute health treatment contexts. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Cancer; Chemotherapy; Emotion; Mindfulness; Relaxation,,2-s2.0-85029671426

Methods: A prospective, multicenter, single-arm safety and efficacy study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02080871) of the VBX Stent Graft for treatment of de novo or restenotic lesions in the iliac arteries was conducted under an Investigational Device Exemption at 26 US sites and 1 New Zealand center. The study eligibility criteria were established with the aim of enrolling more ""real-world"" patients compared with previous iliac stent studies supporting Food and Drug Administration approval. The study enrolled 134 patients (mean age 66±9.5 years; 79 men) with 213 iliac lesions. Three-quarters of the population (101, 75.4%) had Rutherford category 3 ischemia, and 43 (32.1%) patients presented with TASC II C/D lesions. The primary endpoint was a composite of device- or procedure-related death within 30 days, myocardial infarction within 30 days, target lesion revascularization (TLR) within 9 months, and amputation above the metatarsals in the treated leg within 9 months. Results: In all, 234 devices were implanted in 213 lesions with 100% technical success; 57 (42.5%) patients received kissing stents at the aortic bifurcation. No devices exhibited a discernable change in length after final deployment as determined by independent core laboratory quantitative angiographic analysis. At 9 months, 3 (2.3%) of 132 patients (1 lost to follow-up, 1 unrelated death) experienced a major adverse event (3 TLRs) related to the primary endpoint. At 9 months, there were no device-related serious adverse events or unanticipated adverse device effects. Conclusion: The next-generation balloon-expandable stent-graft demonstrated notable 9-month safety and efficacy in treating iliac occlusive disease in patients reflecting common clinical practice. ?

This study explores the environmental factors that inform and support workplace learning within a clinical environment. Methods: An observational study drawing on ethnographic methods was undertaken in a general medicine ward. Observers paid attention to interactions among staff members that involved potential teaching and learning moments that occurred and were visible in the course of routine work. General purpose thematic analysis of field notes was undertaken. Results: A total of 376 observations were undertaken and documented. The findings suggest that place (location of interaction), rhythm (regularity of activities occurring in the ward) and artefacts (objects and equipment) were strong influences on the interactions and exchanges that occurred. Each of these themes had inherent tensions that could promote or inhibit engagement and therefore learning opportunities. Although many learning opportunities were available, not all were taken up or recognised by the participants. Conclusions: We describe and make explicit how the natural environment of a?medical ward and flow of work through patient care contribute to the learning architecture, and how this creates or inhibits?opportunities for learning. Awareness?of learning opportunities was often tacit and not explicit for either supervisor or learner. We identify strategies through which tensions inherent within space, artefacts and the rhythms of work can be resolved and learning opportunities maximised. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and The Association for the Study of Medical Education",,adult; artifact; awareness; drawing; environmental factor; female; general practice; human; learning environment; male; observational study; patient care; rhythm; staff; teaching; tension; thematic analysis; workplace; artifact; clinical education; health care facility; learning; procedures; workplace; Adult; Artifacts; Clinical Clerkship; Humans; Learning; Patients' Rooms; Teaching; Workplace,2-s2.0-85029229813

The etiology of PE remains unclear; however, growing evidence indicates that mitochondrial impairment contributes to the pathogenesis. Therefore, we aim to investigate the function of mitochondria in the development of PE. The mitochondrial metabolome in preeclamptic (n = 11) and normal (n = 11) placentas were analyzed using Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Student's t-tests and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were conducted to determine which mitochondrial metabolites differed significantly between the two groups. The Pathway Activity Profiling (PAPi) R package was used to predict which metabolic pathways were affected by PE. Western blot analysis was performed to identify the candidate proteins which were associated with mitochondrial repair regulation. GC-MS analysis demonstrated that higher levels of 38 metabolites and lower levels of 2 metabolites were observed in the placenta of patients with severe PE (sPE). Five fatty acids had an area under the ROC curve above 90%. Furthermore, we revealed abnormal regulation of mitochondrial dynamics, autophagy, and biogenesis in sPE. Our discoveries indicate that the compromised lipid metabolism in sPE may result from dysfunctional mitochondria, thus revealing new insights into the etiology of the disease. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Impaired mitochondria; Lipid metabolism; Metabolomics; Preeclampsia,adenosine triphosphate; amino acid; arachidonic acid; bihomo gamma linoleate; docosapentaenoic acid; dynamin I; gamma linoleate; linoleic acid; mitofusin 1; myristic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; prostaglandin; saturated fatty acid; sirtuin 3; unclassified drug; unsaturated fatty acid; adenosine triphosphate; proteome; adult; arachidonic acid metabolism; area under the curve; Article; autophagy; biogenesis; cell fusion; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; disorders of mitochondrial functions; female; genetic association; human; human tissue; lipid metabolism; mass fragmentography; metabolome; mitochondrial biogenesis; mitochondrial dynamics; mitochondrion; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; placenta tissue; preeclampsia; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; signal transduction; Western blotting; case control study; discriminant analysis; least square analysis; metabolism; metabolomics; mitochondrion; organelle biogenesis; pathology; preeclampsia; pregnancy; Adenosine Triphosphate; Adult; Autophagy; Case-Control Studies; Discriminant Analysis; Female; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Dynamics; Organelle Biogenesis; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Proteome,2-s2.0-85026304774

Methods: COS (MW2000-5000) were chemically tethered onto the liposomes through a disulfide linker (-SS-) to cholesterol (Chol). Doxorubicin (DOX) was actively loaded in the liposomes. Their reduction-sensitivities, cellular uptake, cytotoxicity, pharmacokinetics and antitumor efficacy were investigated. Results: The Chol-SS-COS/DOX liposomes (100?nm) had zeta potential of 33.9?mV and high drug loading (13% w/w). The liposomes were stable with minimal drug leakage under physiological conditions but destabilized in the presence of reducing agents, dithiothreitol (DTT) or glutathione (GSH) at 10?mM, the cytosolic level. MTT assay revealed that the cationic Chol-SS-COS/DOX liposomes had higher cytotoxicity to MG63-osteosarcoma cells than non-reduction sensitive liposome (Chol-COS/DOX). Flow cytometry and confocal microscopy revealed that Chol-SS-COS/DOX internalized more efficiently than Chol-COS/DOX with more content to cytoplasm whereas Chol-COS/DOX located around the cell membrane. Chol-SS-COS/DOX preferentially internalized into MG63 cancer cell over LO2 normal liver cells. In rats both liposomes produced a prolonged half-life of DOX by 4 - 5.5 fold (p?<?0.001) compared with the DOX solution. Chol-SS-COS/DOX exhibited strong inhibitory effect on tumor growth in MG63 cell-bearing nude mice (n?=?6), and extended animal survival rate. Conclusions: Reduction-responsive Chol-SS-COS liposomes may be an excellent platform for cytoplasmic delivery of anticancer drugs.

The processing of the amyloid-β (Aβ) protein is conserved between sheep and human, and sheep Aβ1–42/Aβ1–40 ratios in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are also very similar to human. In addition, total tau and neurofilament light levels in CSF are comparable with those found in human. The presence of neurofibrillary tangles in aged sheep brain has previously been established; here, we report for the first time that plaques, the other pathologic hallmark of AD, are also present in the aged sheep brain.

There is an opportunity to learn from (and therefore prevent) these bleeding deaths. We reviewed all reported episodes of death due to vascular access bleeding in Australia and New Zealand over a 14-year period together with individual dialysis units’ root cause analyses on each event.

However, the vitreous and some of the retinal layers themselves act as significant barriers to efficient delivery of drugs administered intravitreally. This study aimed to improve the diffusive mobility of nanoparticles (NPs) in the vitreous and enhance their permeation across the retina after intravitreal injection by application of ultrasound (US). Ex vivo posterior bovine eye cups were used and the vitreous was either left intact or removed gently from the neural retina. Hyaluronic acid coated human serum albumin NPs were administered into the eye cups and continuous US with a frequency of 1?MHz, an intensity of 0.5?W/cm2, and a duration of 30?s was applied once or repeatedly via the transscleral route. After pre-determined time points, fluorescence intensities in the vitreous and the retina were analyzed. Short pulses of US significantly improved the diffusive mobility of NPs through the vitreous as well as their penetration across the neural retina into the retinal pigment epithelium and choroid without causing any detectable damage to the ocular tissues. Therefore, transscleral US could be a powerful and safe tool to enhance retinal delivery of intravitreally injected NPs. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Intravitreal mobility; Nanoparticles; Ocular drug delivery; Retinal penetration; Safety; Ultrasound,connexin43 mimetic peptide; fluorescein isothiocyanate; human serum albumin; hyaluronic acid; nanocarrier; peptidomimetic agent; unclassified drug; nanoparticle; animal tissue; Article; bovine; choroid; diffusion; drug delivery device; drug delivery system; drug penetration; eye tissue; histology; nonhuman; quantitative analysis; retina disease; retinal neuroepithelial layer; retinal pigment epithelium; synthesis; transscleral ultrasound; animal; drug delivery system; drug effect; intravitreal drug administration; metabolism; organ culture technique; pig; procedures; retina; ultrasound; Animals; Cattle; Drug Delivery Systems; Intravitreal Injections; Nanoparticles; Organ Culture Techniques; Retina; Swine; Ultrasonic Waves,2-s2.0-85020496381

We show here that tonabersat directly inhibits connexin43 hemichannel opening. Connexin43 hemichannels have been called “pathological pores” based upon their role in secondary lesion spread, edema, inflammation, and neuronal loss following central nervous system injuries, as well as in chronic inflammatory disease. Both connexin43 hemichannels and pannexin channels released adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during ischemia in an in vitro ischemia model, but only connexin43 hemichannels contributed to ATP release during reperfusion. Tonabersat inhibited connexin43 hemichannel-mediated ATP release during both ischemia and reperfusion phases, with direct channel block confirmed using electrophysiology. Tonabersat also reduced connexin43 gap junction coupling in vitro, but only at higher concentrations, with junctional plaques internalized and degraded via the lysosomal pathway. Systemic delivery of tonabersat in a rat bright-light retinal damage model (a model for dry age-related macular degeneration) resulted in significantly improved functional outcomes assessed using electroretinography. Tonabersat also prevented thinning of the retina, especially the outer nuclear layer and choroid, assessed using optical coherence tomography. We conclude that tonabersat, already given orally to over 1000 humans in clinical trials (as a potential treatment for, and prophylactic treatment of, migraine because it was thought to inhibit cortical spreading depression), is a connexin hemichannel inhibitor and may have the potential to be a novel treatment of central nervous system injury and chronic neuroinflammatory disease. ? 2017, The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.",CNS disease; connexin hemichannel; connexin43; gap junction; Tonabersat,"adenosine triphosphate; connexin 43; tonabersat; benzamide derivative; benzopyran derivative; connexin 43; gap junction protein; GJA1 protein, human; nerve protein; PANX1 protein, human; tonabersat; age related macular degeneration; Alzheimer disease; animal cell; animal experiment; ARPE-19 cell line; Article; brain ischemia; central nervous system disease; cerebrovascular accident; choroid; chronic inflammation; chronic pain; controlled study; diabetic retinopathy; electrophysiology; electroretinogram; female; gap junction; glia cell; human; human cell; immunocytochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; light damage; male; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; pH; priority journal; protein degradation; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; reperfusion; reperfusion injury; retina injury; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell culture; drug effect; electroretinography; encephalitis; lysosome; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; retina; Sprague Dawley rat; Adenosine Triphosphate; Animals; Benzamides; Benzopyrans; Cells, Cultured; Connexin 43; Connexins; Electroretinography; Encephalitis; Female; Humans; Lysosomes; Male; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Retina",2-s2.0-85019758423

Correlating the amount of “internal” (episodic) and “external” (semantic) details generated when describing autobiographical events can illuminate the relationship between the processes supporting these constructs. Yet previous studies performing such correlations were limited by aggregating data across all events generated by an individual, potentially obscuring the underlying relationship within the events themselves. In the current article, we reanalyzed datasets from eight studies using a multilevel approach, allowing us to explore the relationship between internal and external details within events. We also examined whether this relationship changes with healthy aging. Our reanalyses demonstrated a largely negative relationship between the internal and external details produced when describing autobiographical memories and future imaginations. This negative relationship was stronger and more consistent for older adults and was evident both in direct and indirect measures of semantic content. Moreover, this relationship appears to be specific to episodic tasks, as no relationship was observed for a nonepisodic picture description task. This negative association suggests that people do not generate semantic information indiscriminately, but do so in a compensatory manner, to embellish episodically impoverished events. Our reanalysis further lends support for dissociable processes underpinning episodic and semantic information generation when remembering and imagining autobiographical events. ? 2017, Psychonomic Society, Inc.",Aging; Autobiographical memory; Memory; Semantic memory,"adult; aging; autobiographical memory; dissociation; human; imagination; multilevel analysis; semantic memory; aged; episodic memory; imagination; multilevel analysis; physiology; recall; semantics; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Humans; Imagination; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Multilevel Analysis; Semantics; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85019667100

Methods: A computerized, systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, CINAHL, SPORTDiscus, and The Cochrane Library, from January 2005 to November 2015, to identify all randomized controlled trials related to exercise in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. The initial search identified 915 studies, with a final yield of 10 studies. Only randomized controlled trials that examined the effects of exercise programs longer than 24 weeks in women aged 35 to 70 years were included. The 10 studies quantified at least BMD and described training variables adequately (training period, frequency, volume, intensity). Results: Ten studies with moderate quality evidence (6.4 ± 1.8 points, range 4-9) were included. Significant changes in lumbar and femoral neck BMD were found mainly with high-impact exercise and whole body vibration interventions. Conclusions: While training effects must be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity of the protocols and exercises performed, this systematic review confirmed the effectiveness of impact exercises combined with other forms of training (vibration or strength training) to preserve BMD in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women. Despite the results possibly not representing a general dose-response relationship, we highlight the importance of quantifying loading intensity and frequency by means of accelerometry as these parameters are determinants for bone adaptation. ? 2017 by The North American Menopause Society.",Bone mineral density; Exercise; Loading intensity; Strength; Vibration,accelerometry; adult; aged; bone density; Cinahl; Cochrane Library; controlled study; dose response; female; femoral neck; human; lumbar region; Medline; population group; postmenopause; quantitative study; resistance training; systematic review; Web of Science; whole body vibration; bone density; climacterium; exercise; femoral neck; kinesiotherapy; lumbar vertebra; physiology; postmenopause; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); resistance training; time factor; Bone Density; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Female; Femur Neck; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Perimenopause; Postmenopause; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Resistance Training; Time Factors,2-s2.0-85019575505

The related metabolic consequences that arise from being overweight or obese are a paramount global health concern, and represent a significant burden on healthcare systems. Furthermore, being overweight or obese during pregnancy increases the risk of offspring developing obesity and other related metabolic complications in later life, which can therefore perpetuate a transgenerational cycle of obesity. Obesity is associated with a chronic state of low-grade metabolic inflammation. However, the role of maternal obesity-mediated alterations in inflammatory processes as a mechanism underpinning developmental programming in offspring is less understood. Further, the use of anti-inflammatory agents as an intervention strategy to ameliorate or reverse the impact of adverse developmental programming in the setting of maternal obesity has not been well studied.

We examined the sociodemographic and behavioral predictors of total and device-specific SVT in a Singaporean cohort. Methods: At ages 2 and 3 years, SVT of 910 children was reported by their parents. Interviewer-administered questionnaires assessed SVT on weekdays and weekends for television, computer, and hand-held devices. Multivariable linear mixed-effect models were used to examine the associations of total and device-specific SVT at ages 2 and 3 with predictors, including children's sex, ethnicity, birth order, family income, and parental age, education, BMI, and television viewing time. Results: At age 2, children's total SVT averaged 2.4±2.2 (mean±SD) hours/day, including 1.6±1.6 and 0.7±1.0h/day for television and hand-held devices, respectively. At age 3, hand-held device SVT was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.4) hours/day higher, while no increases were observed for other devices. SVT tracked moderately from 2 to 3years (r=0.49, p<0.0001). Compared to Chinese children, Malay and Indian children spent 1.04 (0.66, 1.41) and 0.54 (0.15, 0.94) more hours/day watching screens, respectively. Other predictors of longer SVT were younger maternal age, lower maternal education, and longer parental television time. Conclusions: In our cohort, the main predictors of longer children's SVT were Malay and Indian ethnicity, younger maternal age, lower education and longer parental television viewing time.

We have previously shown for the estrogen-responsive MCF-7 cell line that exposure to tamoxifen or deprivation of estrogen leads initially to inhibition of cell proliferation followed after several months by the emergence of resistant sub-lines that are phenotypically different from the parental line. We examined the early responses of MCF-7 cells following either exposure to 4-hydroxytamoxifen or deprivation of estrogen for periods of 2 days-4 weeks. Methods: Endocrine-sensitive or -resistant breast cancer cell lines were used to examine the expression of the stem cell gene SOX2 and the Wnt effector genes AXIN2 and DKK1 using quantitative PCR analysis. Breast cancer cell lines were used to assess the anti-proliferative effects (as determined by IC50 values) of Wnt pathway inhibitors LGK974 and IWP-2. Results: Hormone therapy led to time-dependent increases of up to 10-fold in SOX2 expression up to threefold in expression of the Wnt target genes AXIN2 and DKK1 and variable changes in NANOG and OCT4 expression. The cells also showed increased mammosphere formation and increased CD24 surface protein expression. Some but not all hormone-resistant MCF-7 sub-lines emerging after long-term hormonal stress, showed up to 50-fold increases in SOX2 expression and smaller increases in AXIN2 and DKK1 expression. However the increase in Wnt target gene expression was not accompanied by an increase in sensitivity to Wnt pathway inhibitors LGK974 and IWP-2. A general trend of lower IC50 values was observed in 3-dimensional spheroid culture conditions (which allowed enrichment of cells with cancer stem cell phenotype) relative to monolayer cultures. The endocrine-resistant cell lines showed no significant increase in sensitivity to Wnt inhibitors. Conclusion: Hormone treatment of cultured MCF-7 cells leads within 2 days to increased expression of components of the SOX2 and Wnt pathways and to increased potential for mammosphere formation. We suggest that these responses are indicative of early adaptation to endocrine stress with features of stem cell character and that this facilitates the survival of emerging hormone-resistant cell populations. ? 2017 Leung, Askarian-Amiri, Sarkar, Ferraro-Peyret, Joseph, Finlay and Baguley.",Breast cancer; Endocrine resistance; SOX2; stem cell CD24 CD44; Wnt signaling pathway,cell marker; iwp 2; lgk 974; protein inhibitor; transcription factor Sox2; unclassified drug; Wnt protein; antiproliferative activity; Article; axin2 gene; cancer hormone therapy; cell proliferation assay; cell viability assay; clinical trial; controlled study; dkk1 gene; DNA synthesis; drug sensitivity; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; flow cytometry; gene; gene expression; human; human cell; IC50; immunoblotting; MCF-7 cell line; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; short tandem repeat; sox2 gene; stem cell; stress; upregulation; Wnt signaling,2-s2.0-85028932563

The withdrawal of progesterone, either actual or functional, is thought to be an antecedent to the onset of labour. There remains limited information on clinically relevant health outcomes as to whether vaginal progesterone may be of benefit for pregnant women with a history of a previous preterm birth, who are at high risk of a recurrence. Our primary aim was to assess whether the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries in women with a history of previous spontaneous preterm birth reduced the risk and severity of respiratory distress syndrome in their infants, with secondary aims of examining the effects on other neonatal morbidities and maternal health and assessing the adverse effects of treatment. Methods: Women with a live singleton or twin pregnancy between 18 to <24 weeks’ gestation and a history of prior preterm birth at less than 37 weeks’ gestation in the preceding pregnancy, where labour occurred spontaneously or in association with cervical incompetence or following preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes, were eligible. Women were recruited from 39 Australian, New Zealand, and Canadian maternity hospitals and assigned by randomisation to vaginal progesterone pessaries (equivalent to 100 mg vaginal progesterone) (n = 398) or placebo (n = 389). Participants and investigators were masked to the treatment allocation. The primary outcome was respiratory distress syndrome and severity. Secondary outcomes were other respiratory morbidities; other adverse neonatal outcomes; adverse outcomes for the woman, especially related to preterm birth; and side effects of progesterone treatment. Data were analysed for all the 787 women (100%) randomised and their 799 infants. Findings: Most women used their allocated study treatment (740 women, 94.0%), with median use similar for both study groups (51.0 days, interquartile range [IQR] 28.0–69.0, in the progesterone group versus 52.0 days, IQR 27.0–76.0, in the placebo group). The incidence of respiratory distress syndrome was similar in both study groups—10.5% (42/402) in the progesterone group and 10.6% (41/388) in the placebo group (adjusted relative risk [RR] 0.98, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.64–1.49, p = 0.912)—as was the severity of any neonatal respiratory disease (adjusted treatment effect 1.02, 95% CI 0.69–1.53, p = 0.905). No differences were seen between study groups for other respiratory morbidities and adverse infant outcomes, including serious infant composite outcome (155/406 [38.2%] in the progesterone group and 152/393 [38.7%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82–1.17, p = 0.798). The proportion of infants born before 37 weeks’ gestation was similar in both study groups (148/406 [36.5%] in the progesterone group and 146/393 [37.2%] in the placebo group, adjusted RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.81–1.17, p = 0.765). A similar proportion of women in both study groups had maternal morbidities, especially those related to preterm birth, or experienced side effects of treatment. In 9.9% (39/394) of the women in the progesterone group and 7.3% (28/382) of the women in the placebo group, treatment was stopped because of side effects (adjusted RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.85–2.15, p = 0.204). The main limitation of the study was that almost 9% of the women did not start the medication or forgot to use it 3 or more times a week. Conclusions: Our results do not support the use of vaginal progesterone pessaries in women with a history of a previous spontaneous preterm birth to reduce the risk of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome or other neonatal and maternal morbidities related to preterm birth. Individual participant data meta-analysis of the relevant trials may identify specific women for whom vaginal progesterone might be of benefit.

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of school-based interventions for childhood obesity conducted in mainland China. Methods: A systematic search was undertaken in eight databases to identify both randomized and non-randomized controlled trials from January 1990 to December 2015 examining the effectiveness of school-based obesity interventions. A random effects meta-analysis was conducted assessing the impact of included interventions on (body mass index) BMI. The quality of each included studies were assessed using Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment Tool. A P value &lt;0.05 (two-sided) was considered statistically significant. Result: Of the seventy-six included studies, we found physical activity and health education were the two most common components of interventions. More treatment studies were effective compared with prevention studies (85.0% vs. 58.3%). Comprehensive interventions involving physical activity and health education appeared more effective than the physical activity only interventions in both obesity treatment and prevention studies. The meta-analyses showed comprehensive interventions involving physical activity and health education had larger effect on the change of BMI than physical activity only interventions (treatment studies: -1.80 kg/m2 (95% CI: -2.15,-1.44) vs. -0.91 kg/m2 (95% CI: -1.15,-0.67); prevention studies: -0.19 kg/m2 (95% CI: -0.27, -0.11) vs. +0.05 kg/m2 (95% CI: -0.04, +0.15)).

The health of the tear film and ocular surface influences the likelihood of being able to achieve successful contact lens wear. Contact lens discomfort and dryness are the most frequent reasons why contact lens wearers experience reduced wearing times, which can eventually lead to contact lens discontinuation. Comprehensive clinical assessment of tear film integrity and ocular surface health is therefore essential prior to commencing contact lens wear, to enable the ocular surface environment to be optimised to support lens wear. These parameters should also be evaluated over the course of contact lens wear, in order to identify any aspects requiring clinical management and ensure maintenance of optimal lens-wearing conditions. This review summarises current knowledge relating to the effects of soft contact lens wear on the tear film and ocular surface. It also provides a systematic approach to evaluating tear film and ocular surface integrity, in order to guide the clinical management of tear film anomalies with respect to contact lens wear. ? 2017 Optometry Australia",conjunctiva; contact lenses; cornea; dry eye; tears,"chemistry; dry eye; human; hydrophilic contact lens; lacrimal fluid; lipid metabolism; metabolism; refraction error; utilization; visual disorder; Contact Lenses, Hydrophilic; Dry Eye Syndromes; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Refractive Errors; Tears; Vision Disorders",2-s2.0-85029634932

We thus undertook a systematic review based on key questions (KQs) using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome format. The KQs follow: Among children with chronic (> 4 weeks) cough (KQ 1) are the common etiologies different from those in adults? (KQ 2) Are the common etiologies age or setting dependent, or both? (KQ 3) Is OSA a cause of chronic cough in children? Methods We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol and the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework. Data from the systematic reviews in conjunction with patients’ values and preferences and the clinical context were used to form recommendations. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus. Results Combining KQs 1 and 2, we found moderate-level evidence from 10 prospective studies that the etiologies of cough in children are different from those in adults and are setting dependent. Data from three studies found that common etiologies of cough in young children were different from those in older children. However, data relating sleep abnormalities to chronic cough in children were found only in case studies. Conclusions There is moderate-quality evidence that common etiologies of chronic cough in children are different from those in adults and are dependent on age and setting. As there are few data relating OSA and chronic cough in children, the panel suggested that these children should be managed in accordance with pediatric sleep guidelines. ? 2017",cough; evidence-based medicine; pediatrics,"corticosteroid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; allergic rhinitis; Article; asthma; Australia; bronchitis; bronchus hyperreactivity; childhood disease; chronic cough; Delphi study; dyspnea; evidence based medicine; gastroesophageal reflux; human; hypoxemia; interstitial lung disease; practice guideline; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; sinusitis; sleep disorder; sleep disordered breathing; systematic review; tachypnea; United States; adolescent; age; child; chronic disease; Cough; infant; preschool child; Adolescent; Age Factors; Child; Child, Preschool; Chronic Disease; Cough; Humans; Infant",2-s2.0-85028984544

The estimated regression coefficients (β) and 95% CIs were combined and meta-analysed. Data from 7,351 youths and five studies were analysed. Pooled analysis from cross-sectional studies shows that replacing sedentary time with LIPA showed no significant associations with any adiposity-related outcomes. Replacing sedentary time with MVPA was statistically associated with total body fat percentage (β?=??2.512; p?=?0.003), but not with body mass index or waist circumference. In subgroup analysis, the greatest magnitude of association was observed from studies where 60?min of sedentary behaviour was reallocated to 60?min of MVPA (β?=??4.535; p?<?0.001). Our results highlight the importance of promoting MVPA, which may improve body composition phenotypes in young people.

Recent findings Most recent studies confirmed the relationship between mental health status, especially negative affect and depressive symptoms, and sexual health in older adulthood. However, when this relationship is investigated more deeply, it seems that in fact positive psychological well being (positive affect and quality of life) accounts for sexual activity rather than the lack of depressive symptoms. Moreover, recent studies provided more insight into the relationship between marital characteristics, religion, cognitive functioning and sleeping difficulties and different dimensions of sexual health in older adulthood. Summary In summary, there is substantial previous research revealing associations between various psychosocial, health-related and demographic variables and sexual health in older adulthood. Most considered variables are, for example, age, sex, general physical and mental health. For future research, it is important to consider that relationships between specific variables and sexual health in higher age are usually more complex than they are expected to be and factors differ between different dimensions of sexual health. Communication about sexuality between health-care providers and older patients still implies a lot of barriers and lack of knowledge. Therefore, the provision of communication training for health-care providers to older people in which knowledge is gained about correlates of sexual health in older adulthood should be implemented. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Design Prospective cohort study. Methods Prospective assessment of consecutive phacoemulsification cases (N = 500) enabled calculation of a risk score (M-score of 0–8) using a risk stratification system. M-scores of >3 were allocated to senior surgeons. All surgeries were performed in a public teaching hospital setting, Auckland, New Zealand, in early 2016. Postoperatively, data were reviewed for complications and corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA). Results were compared to a prospective study (N = 500, phase 1) performed prior to formal introduction of risk stratification. Results Intraoperative complications increased with increasing M-scores (P =.044). Median M-score for complicated cases was higher (P =.022). Odds ratio (OR) for a complication increased 1.269 per unit increase in M-score (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.007–1.599, P =.043). Overall rate of any intraoperative complication was 5.0%. Intraoperative complication rates decreased from 8.4% to 5.0% (OR = 0.576, P =.043) comparing phase 1 and phase 2 (formal introduction of risk stratification). The severity of complications also reduced. A significant decrease in complications for M = 0 (ie, minimal risk cases) was also identified comparing the current study (3.1%) to phase 1 (7.2%), P =.034. There was no change in postoperative complication risks (OR 0.812, P =.434) or in mean postoperative CDVA (20/30, P =.484) comparing current with phase 1 outcomes. Conclusion A simple preoperative risk stratification system, based on standard patient information gathered at preoperative consultation, appears to reduce intraoperative complications and support safer surgical training by appropriate allocation of higher-risk cases. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"adolescent; adult; aged; aphakia; Article; cataract; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; consultation; corrected distance visual acuity; disease severity; female; high risk patient; human; iris disease; iris prolapse; iris trauma; lens capsule rupture; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; peroperative complication; phacoemulsification; postoperative complication; preoperative period; priority journal; prospective study; risk reduction; surgical training; teaching hospital; vitreous disease; vitreous loss; zonular dialysis; case management; clinical competence; education; Intraoperative Complications; medical education; middle aged; odds ratio; ophthalmology; phacoemulsification; physiology; preoperative care; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; very elderly; visual acuity; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case Management; Clinical Competence; Cohort Studies; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Internship and Residency; Intraoperative Complications; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Odds Ratio; Ophthalmology; Phacoemulsification; Preoperative Care; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Visual Acuity",2-s2.0-85023626525

Nudges could offer a much-needed strategy to foster sustainable improvements in dietary behaviors and weight status. Aim To systematically review the effectiveness of nudge interventions designed to improve children's dietary behaviors within the family home (or another environment if judged transferable to the home). Methods English-language studies published January 1996–January 2015 were identified in MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and PubMed, followed by dual screening and quality evaluation. Inclusion: controlled studies; nudge with in-home potential. Exclusion: medical health conditions. Results Of the 40 included studies, 33 (83%) showed improvement in dietary behaviors (e.g. more vegetables, smaller unhealthy portions) and were more effective in older children/adolescents. The quality of most studies was rated as weak (43%) or moderate (40%), with only six studies rated strong (15%), reflecting major issues with quality, effectiveness and generalizability. Nudges were typically assessed in isolation and examined immediate effects on behavior. Conclusion Despite substantial methodological limitations and inconsistencies, the literature indicates that nudges may improve children's immediate dietary behaviors. It is unclear whether these improvements could be sustained or affect body weight (PROSPERO, CRD42016036373). ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Child; Choice-architecture; Diet; Home environment; Nudge; Obesity,behavior assessment; body weight; child behavior; child nutrition; clinical effectiveness; dietary intake; family health; feeding behavior; health care quality; health status; home; home parenteral nutrition; human; methodology; Review; systematic review; total quality management; unhealthy diet; vegetable,2-s2.0-85021728423

Study design A retrospective, observational cohort study of 443 infants born weighing <1500 g or <30 weeks of gestation, and admitted within 24 hours to National Women's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand. Glucose variability was defined as the standard deviation around the mean after log transformation of all blood glucose concentrations. Absolute glycemic excursions in the first week were used to divide the infants into 4 groups: normoglycemic; hypoglycemic; hyperglycemic, and unstable. Results Compared with normoglycemic infants, hypoglycemic and unstable infants had lower birth weight z-scores, and hyperglycemic and unstable infants were of lower birth weight. Hypoglycemic infants had similar outcomes to normoglycemic infants. Hyperglycemic and unstable infants were less likely to survive without neonatal morbidity and less likely to survive without neurodevelopmental impairment at 2 years of age. Higher mean blood glucose concentration was seen in the hyperglycemic and unstable groups, and was associated with worse neonatal and 2-year outcomes. Greater glucose variability was seen in the hypoglycemic and unstable groups, and was associated with worse neonatal illness but not outcome at 2 years. No associations between measures of neonatal glycemia and neonatal or 2-year outcomes remained after correction for gestation, birth weight z-score, and socioeconomic status. Conclusions In very preterm infants, measures of neonatal glycemia are markers of gestational age and intrauterine growth, and are not independent predictors of neonatal illness or outcomes at 2 years of age. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",glucose variability; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; neurodevelopment; preterm infant,"glucose; glucose blood level; Article; birth weight; chronic lung disease; cohort analysis; female; gestational age; glucose blood level; human; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; infant; infection; major clinical study; male; mental disease; necrotizing enterocolitis; newborn; newborn disease; newborn morbidity; newborn period; observational study; outcome assessment; pregnancy; prematurity; priority journal; retrospective study; socioeconomics; survival; child development; Infant, Premature, Diseases; New Zealand; prematurity; preschool child; very low birth weight; Blood Glucose; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infant, Premature, Diseases; Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Male; New Zealand; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85021090053

We developed a universal cognitive behavioural therapy-based programme (MEMO CBT) to be delivered via multimedia mobile phone messages for teens. Methods: We conducted a prospective multicentre, randomised, placebo-controlled superiority trial in 15 high schools in Auckland, New Zealand, comparing MEMO CBT with a control programme [MEMO control] matched for intensity and type of message but with alternative content not targeting depression. The primary outcome was the change in score on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised from baseline to 12?months. Secondary outcomes included the change in scores in the self-reported Reynold's Adolescent Depression Rating Scale-Second Edition, the Moods and Feelings Questionnaire, suicidal ideation using selected items from the Youth Risk Behaviour Survey, the?Pediatric Quality of Life questionnaire, 12-month period prevalence of the diagnosis of depressive disorder using the Kiddie-Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia, and students' ratings of their satisfaction with the programme. Results: Eight hundred and fifty-five students (13–17?years old, mean 14.3?years) were randomly assigned to MEMO CBT (426) or to MEMO Control (429). Participants (68% female) had a mean CDRS-R at baseline of 21.5 (SD: 5). Overall 394 (93%) from the intervention group and 392 (91%) from the control group were followed up at 12?months. At the end of the intervention (approximately 9?weeks) the mean CDRS-R scores were 20.8 in the intervention group versus 20.4 in the control group, and at 12?months they were 22.4 versus 22.4 (p value for difference in change from baseline?=?0.3). There was no obvious association between the amount of the intervention viewed by participants and outcomes. Conclusions: There was no evidence of benefit from the mobile phone CBT intervention compared with a control programme.

In this mini-review, we present evidence in support of the use of ganaxolone, a GABAA agonist neurosteroid, as a novel neonatal therapy. We discuss evidence that ganaxolone can provide both seizure control and neuroprotection with a high safety profile when administered early following birth-related hypoxia, and show evidence that it is likely to prevent or reduce the incidence of the enduring disabilities associated with preterm birth, cerebral palsy, and epilepsy.

However, little is known about its biotransformation in normal tissues. Here, we evaluate implications of biotransformation of SN30000 for its toxicokinetics in NIH-III mice. The metabolite profile demonstrated reduction to the 1-N-oxide (M14), oxidation of the morpholine side-chain (predominantly to the alkanoic acid M18) and chromophore, and subsequent glucuronidation. Plasma pharmacokinetics of SN30000 and its reduced metabolites was unaffected by the presence of HT29 tumor xenografts, indicating extensive reduction in normal tissues. This bioreductive metabolism, as modeled by hepatic S9 preparations, was strongly inhibited by oxygen indicating that it proceeds via the one-electron (radical) intermediate previously implicated in induction of DNA double strand breaks and cytotoxicity by SN30000. Plasma pharmacokinetics of SN30000 and M14 (butnot M18) corresponded closely to the timing of reversible acute clinical signs (reduced mobility) and marked hypothermia (rectal temperature drop of ?8°C at nadir following the maximum tolerated dose). Similar acute toxicity was elicited by dosing with TPZ or M14, although M14 did not induce the kidney and lung histopathology caused by SN30000. M14 also lacked antiproliferative potency in hypoxic cell cultures. In addition M14 showed much slower redox cycling than SN30000 in oxic cultures. Thus a non-bioreductive mechanism, mediated through M14, appears to be responsible for the acute toxicity of SN30000 while late toxicities are consistent with DNA damage resulting from its one-electron reduction. A two-compartment pharmacokinetic model, in which clearance of SN30000 is determined by temperature-dependent bioreductive metabolism to M14, was shown to describe the non-linear PK of SN30000 in mice. This study demonstrates the importance of non-tumor bioreductive metabolism in the toxicology and pharmacokinetics of benzotriazine di-oxides designed to target tumor hypoxia. ? 2017 Gu, Chang, Wang, Jaiswal, Edwards, Downes, Liyanage, Lynch, Pruijn, Hickey, Hay, Wilson and Hicks.",Benzotriazine N-oxides; Bioreductive prodrugs; Hypothermia; Pharmacokinetic models; Reductive metabolism; SN30000; Tirapazamine; Tumor hypoxia,"3 (3 morpholinopropyl) 7,8 dihydro 6h indeno[5,6 e][1,2,4]triazine 1,4 dioxide; alkanoic acid; antineoplastic agent; drug metabolite; morpholine; oxygen; triazine derivative; unclassified drug; acute disease; acute toxicity; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiproliferative activity; area under the curve; Article; cell hypoxia; clinical feature; colon carcinoma; controlled study; dose response; double stranded DNA break; drug absorption; drug blood level; drug clearance; drug cytotoxicity; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug formulation; drug glucuronidation; drug half life; drug megadose; drug metabolism; drug oxidation; drug potency; drug structure; drug targeting; drug tolerability; drug transformation; female; histopathology; HT-29 cell line; human; human cell; lung toxicity; maximum plasma concentration; mouse; nephrotoxicity; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; pharmacokinetics; plasma concentration-time curve; rectum temperature; subcutaneous tissue tumor; temperature dependence; tissue section; toxicokinetics; tumor hypoxia; tumor xenograft; volume of distribution",2-s2.0-85027445809

A qualitative study,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85027253552&doi=10.3390%2fijerph14080908&partnerID=40&md5=337299d93bc0075001ed37b270e98e38,"Many people choose to expose themselves to potentially dangerous sounds such as loud music, either via speakers, personal audio systems, or at clubs. The Conditioning, Adaptation and Acculturation to Loud Music (CAALM) Model has proposed a theoretical basis for this behaviour. To compare the model to data, we interviewed a group of people who were either regular nightclub-goers or who controlled the sound levels in nightclubs (bar managers, musicians, DJs, and sound engineers) about loud sound. Results showed four main themes relating to the enjoyment of loud sound: arousal/excitement, facilitation of socialisation, masking of both external sound and unwanted thoughts, and an emphasis and enhancement of personal identity. Furthermore, an interesting incidental finding was that sound levels appeared to increase gradually over the course of the evening until they plateaued at approximately 97 dBA Leq around midnight. Consideration of the data generated by the analysis revealed a complex of influential factors that support people in wanting exposure to loud sound. Findings were considered in terms of the CAALM Model and could be explained in terms of its principles. From a health promotion perspective, the Social Ecological Model was applied to consider how the themes identified might influence behaviour. They were shown to influence people on multiple levels, providing a powerful system which health promotion approaches struggle to address. ? 2017 by the authors.

The aim of this study was to determine the performance of case definitions of gout using the limited items available in multipurpose cohorts for population-based genetic studies. Methods: This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource. Data, including genome-wide genotypes, were available for 105,421 European participants aged 40-69 years without kidney disease. Gout definitions and combinations of these definitions were identified from previous epidemiological studies. These definitions were tested for association with 30 urate-associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) by logistic regression, adjusted for age, sex, waist circumference, and ratio of waist circumference to height. Heritability estimates under an additive model were generated using GCTA version 1.26.0 and PLINK version 1.90b3.32 by partitioning the genome. Results: There were 2066 (1.96%) cases defined by self-report of gout, 1652 (1.57%) defined by urate-lowering therapy (ULT) use, 382 (0.36%) defined by hospital diagnosis, 1861 (1.76%) defined by hospital diagnosis or gout-specific medications and 2295 (2.18%) defined by self-report of gout or ULT use. Association with gout at experiment-wide significance (P<0.0017) was observed for 13 SNPs with gout using the self-report of gout or ULT use definition, 12 SNPs using the self-report of gout definition, 11 SNPs using the hospital diagnosis or gout-specific medication definition, 10 SNPs using ULT use definition and 3 SNPs using hospital diagnosis definition. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.282 to 0.308 for all definitions except hospital diagnosis (0.236). Conclusions: Of the limited items available in multipurpose cohorts, the case definition of self-report of gout or ULT use has high sensitivity and precision for detecting association in genetic epidemiological studies of gout. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Definition; Epidemiology; Genetic; Gout,"allopurinol; breast cancer resistance protein; colchicine; febuxostat; sulfinpyrazone; urate transporter; antigout agent; uric acid; ABCG2 gene; adult; age; aged; anthropometric parameters; Article; cohort analysis; disease classification; European; female; GCKR gene; gene; genetic association; genetic epidemiology; genetic variability; gout; heritability; hospital diagnosis; human; human genome; male; population research; prevalence; self report of gout; sensitivity and specificity; sex; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLC17A3 gene; SLC22A12 gene; SLC2A9 gene; United Kingdom; urate lowering therapy; waist circumference; waist circumference to height ratio; Winnard definition; biobank; Europe; genetic predisposition; genetics; gout; metabolism; middle aged; self report; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Biological Specimen Banks; Europe; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Self Report; United Kingdom; Uric Acid",2-s2.0-85027168146

Adipokines and cytokines play an important role in metabolism and the course of AP, but there is a paucity of research investigating their relationship with pancreatic hormones after AP. This study aimed to explore associations between pancreatic hormones and adipokines as well as cytokines to provide insights into the pathophysiology of altered pancreatic hormone secretion following AP. Methods: A total of 83 patients previously diagnosed with AP and no prior diabetes or pre-diabetes were recruited into this cross-sectional follow up study. Fasting venous blood samples were collected to analyse a panel of pancreatic hormones and derivatives (amylin, C-peptide, glucagon, insulin, pancreatic polypeptide, somatostatin), adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, retinol binding protein-4, and resistin), and cytokines (interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)). Linear regression analyses were used, and potential confounders were adjusted for in multivariate analyses. Results: Insulin was significantly associated with IL-6 in both unadjusted and adjusted models (p =.029 and p =.040, respectively). Amylin was significantly associated with MCP-1 in the unadjusted model (p =.046), and TNF-α in unadjusted and adjusted models (p =.025 and p =.027, respectively). Conclusions: Insulin and amylin have a strong positive association with pro-inflammatory cytokines in patients following an episode of AP. These associations have possible relevance in the development of diabetes associated with diseases of the exocrine pancreas, providing the opportunity to develop novel treatment paradigms. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",acute pancreatitis; amylin; cytokines; Insulin; low-grade inflammation; post-pancreatitis diabetes,"adiponectin; ADIPOQ protein, human; amylin; autacoid; CCL2 protein, human; cytokine; IL6 protein, human; insulin; interleukin 6; leptin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; resistin; RETN protein, human; tumor necrosis factor; acute disease; adult; aged; blood; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; diet restriction; female; follow up; human; male; middle aged; pancreatitis; pathology; physiology; Acute Disease; Adiponectin; Adult; Aged; Chemokine CCL2; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Cytokines; Fasting; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Insulin; Interleukin-6; Islet Amyloid Polypeptide; Leptin; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis; Resistin; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85018476628

Parenteral kanamycin causes high systemic toxicity which could be avoided by direct delivery to the lungs. This study focused on producing a highly aerosolizable dry-powder of hygroscopic kanamycin by spray-drying with L-leucine. Methods Kanamycin powders were prepared with different concentrations (0, 5, 10, 15 and 20% w/w) of L-leucine using the Buchi B-290 Mini Spray-Dryer. In vitro aerosolization efficiency, particle size, morphology, crystallinity, surface composition, drug-excipient interaction and moisture content of the powders were characterized by a Next Generation Impactor (NGI), laser diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, XPS, ATR-FTIR and thermogravimetric analysis. The physicochemical and aerosolization stability of the powders were investigated after one-month storage at 25?±?2?°C/15% RH and 25?±?2?°C/75% RH. The cytotoxicity on Calu-3 and A549 cells of the kanamycin powders was evaluated by MTT assay. Results The spray-dried powder particles were in the inhalable size range (<6.1?μm). The powders with L-leucine were wrinkled in shape, amorphous in nature and had low moisture content (<5.0%). Kanamycin with 5% (w/w) of L-leucine showed the best aerosolization efficiency of 73.0?±?2.5%. The powders remained stable during storage at 25?±?2?°C/15% RH and tolerated by respiratory cell lines. Conclusion L-leucine improved the aerosolization of kanamycin by surface modification, which may be helpful for the effective treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. ? 2017",Dry powder inhaler; Hygroscopic; Kanamycin; L-leucine; Spray-drying; Tuberculosis,"excipient; kanamycin; leucine; kanamycin; A-549 cell line; aerosol; Article; Calu 3 cell line; chemical composition; chemical interaction; clinical evaluation; concentration response; crystallization; cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug formulation; drug resistant tuberculosis; dry powder; in vitro study; infrared spectroscopy; laser diffraction; lung cell line; moisture; MTT assay; particle size; physical chemistry; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; spray drying; surface property; thermogravimetry; water content; X ray diffraction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; aerosol; dry powder inhaler; human; inhalational drug administration; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; powder; tumor cell line; Administration, Inhalation; Aerosols; Cell Line, Tumor; Dry Powder Inhalers; Humans; Kanamycin; Particle Size; Powders; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant",2-s2.0-85020237840

Although GDM usually resolves following birth, it is associated with significant morbidities for mothers and their infants in the short and long term. There is strong evidence to support treatment for GDM. However, there is uncertainty as to whether or not screening all pregnant women for GDM will improve maternal and infant health and if so, the most appropriate setting for screening. This review updates a Cochrane Review, first published in 2010, and subsequently updated in 2014. Objectives: To assess the effects of screening for gestational diabetes mellitus based on different risk profiles and settings on maternal and infant outcomes. Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (31 January 2017), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (14 June 2017), and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: We included randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the effects of different protocols, guidelines or programmes for screening for GDM based on different risk profiles and settings, compared with the absence of screening, or compared with other protocols, guidelines or programmes for screening. We planned to include trials published as abstracts only and cluster-randomised trials, but we did not identify any. Cross-over trials are not eligible for inclusion in this review. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed study eligibility, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias of the included trials. We resolved disagreements through discussion or through consulting a third reviewer. Main results: We included two trials that randomised 4523 women and their infants. Both trials were conducted in Ireland. One trial (which quasi-randomised 3742 women, and analysed 3152 women) compared universal screening versus risk factor-based screening, and one trial (which randomised 781 women, and analysed 690 women) compared primary care screening versus secondary care screening. We were not able to perform meta-analyses due to the different interventions and comparisons assessed. Overall, there was moderate to high risk of bias due to one trial being quasi-randomised, inadequate blinding, and incomplete outcome data in both trials. We used GRADEpro GDT software to assess the quality of the evidence for selected outcomes for the mother and her child. Evidence was downgraded for study design limitations and imprecision of effect estimates. Universal screening versus risk-factor screening (one trial) Mother More women were diagnosed with GDM in the universal screening group than in the risk-factor screening group (risk ratio (RR) 1.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.12 to 3.04; participants = 3152; low-quality evidence). There were no data reported under this comparison for other maternal outcomes including hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, caesarean birth, perineal trauma, gestational weight gain, postnatal depression, and type 2 diabetes. Child Neonatal outcomes: large-for-gestational age, perinatal mortality, mortality or morbidity composite, hypoglycaemia; and childhood/adulthood outcomes: adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and neurosensory disability, were not reported under this comparison. Primary care screening versus secondary care screening (one trial) Mother There was no clear difference between the primary care and secondary care screening groups for GDM (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.50 to 1.66; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), hypertension (RR 1.41, 95% CI 0.77 to 2.59; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), pre-eclampsia (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.36 to 1.78; participants = 690;low-quality evidence), or caesarean section birth (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.27; participants = 690; low-quality evidence). There were no data reported for perineal trauma, gestational weight gain, postnatal depression, or type 2 diabetes. Child There was no clear difference between the primary care and secondary care screening groups for large-for-gestational age (RR 1.37, 95% CI 0.96 to 1.96; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), neonatal complications: composite outcome, including: hypoglycaemia, respiratory distress, need for phototherapy, birth trauma, shoulder dystocia, five minute Apgar less than seven at one or five minutes, prematurity (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.71; participants = 690; low-quality evidence), or neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.28 to 4.38; participants = 690; very low-quality evidence). There was one perinatal death in the primary care screening group and two in the secondary care screening group (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.10 to 12.12; participants = 690; very low-quality evidence). There were no data for neurosensory disability, or childhood/adulthood adiposity or type 2 diabetes. Authors' conclusions: There are insufficient randomised controlled trial data evaluating the effects of screening for GDM based on different risk profiles and settings on maternal and infant outcomes. Low-quality evidence suggests universal screening compared with risk factor-based screening leads to more women being diagnosed with GDM. Low to very low-quality evidence suggests no clear differences between primary care and secondary care screening, for outcomes: GDM, hypertension, pre-eclampsia, caesarean birth, large-for-gestational age, neonatal complications composite, and hypoglycaemia. Further, high-quality randomised controlled trials are needed to assess the value of screening for GDM, which may compare different protocols, guidelines or programmes for screening (based on different risk profiles and settings), with the absence of screening, or with other protocols, guidelines or programmes. There is a need for future trials to be sufficiently powered to detect important differences in short- and long-term maternal and infant outcomes, such as those important outcomes pre-specified in this review. As only a proportion of women will be diagnosed with GDM in these trials, large sample sizes may be required. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"inositol; insulin; oral antidiabetic agent; Apgar score; birth injury; cesarean section; clinical protocol; diet supplementation; evidence based medicine; fetal well being; fetoplacental unit; glycemic control; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hypertension; hypoglycemia; jaundice; kinesiotherapy; large for gestational age; lifestyle modification; maternal welfare; newborn death; oral glucose tolerance test; outcome assessment; phototherapy; postpartum hemorrhage; practice guideline; preeclampsia; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; primary health care; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); respiratory distress; Review; risk assessment; screening test; secondary health care; shoulder dystocia; adverse effects; Diabetes, Gestational; female; glucose tolerance test; infant welfare; mass screening; maternal welfare; meta analysis; newborn; pregnancy; procedures; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Glucose Tolerance Test; Humans; Infant Welfare; Infant, Newborn; Mass Screening; Maternal Welfare; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",2-s2.0-85026807784

Fun 'n healthy in Moreland! aimed to improve child adiposity, school policies and environments, parent engagement, health behaviours and child wellbeing. Methods: All children from primary schools in an inner urban, culturally diverse and economically disadvantaged area in Victoria, Australia were eligible for participation. The intervention, fun 'n healthy in Moreland!, used a Health Promoting Schools Framework and provided schools with evidence, school research data and part time support from a Community Development Worker to develop health promoting strategies. Comparison schools continued as normal. Participants were not blinded to intervention status. The primary outcome was change in adiposity. Repeated cross-sectional design with nested longitudinal subsample. Results: Students from twenty-four primary schools (clusters) were randomised (aged 5-12 years at baseline). 1426 students from 12 intervention schools and 1539 students from 10 comparison schools consented to follow up measurements. Despite increased prevalence of healthy weight across all schools, after 3.5 years of intervention there was no statistically significant difference between trial arms in BMI z score post-intervention (Mean (sd): Intervention 0.68(1.16); Comparison: 0.72(1.12); Adjusted mean difference (AMD): -0.05, CI: -0.19 to 0.08, p = 0.44). Children from intervention schools consumed more daily fruit serves (AMD: 0.19, CI:0.00 to 0.37, p = 0.10), were more likely to have water (AOR: 1.71, CI:1.05 to 2.78, p = 0.03) and vegetables (AOR: 1.23, CI: 0.99 to 1.55, p = 0.07), and less likely to have fruit juice/cordial (AOR: 0.58, CI:0.36 to 0.93, p = 0.02) in school lunch compared to children in comparison schools. More intervention schools (8/11) had healthy eating and physical activity policies compared with comparison schools (2/9). Principals and schools highly valued the approach as a catalyst for broader positive school changes. The cost of the intervention per child was 65 per year. Conclusion: The fun n healthy in Moreland! intervention did not result in statistically significant differences in BMI z score across trial arms but did result in greater policy implementation, increased parent engagement and resources, improved child self-rated health, increased fruit, vegetable and water consumption, and reduction in sweet drinks. A longer-term follow up evaluation may be needed to demonstrate whether these changes are sustainable and impact on childhood overweight and obesity.

Financial connections between drug and device manufacturers with doctors have been extensively debated over the past decade. On one hand, relationships between doctors and industry could be considered synergistic by allowing the development of improved treatments. On the other hand, payment (and other benefits) from industry to doctors may subtly shift the main objective of the collaboration from patients' health to mutual benefits for both doctors and industry. Fertility patients can be considered 'vulnerable' as they face the multiple challenges of seeking to be parents, understanding complex and expensive fertility treatments that are by no means universally successful, and at the same time are under pressure because of their ever-increasing age. They are entitled to receive the most cost-effective treatments. We suggest that specialists in the field of reproductive medicine should be transparent about the receipt of financial benefits, including funding from industry, as it may be influencing both research outcomes and treatments that patients are offered. We also recommend that payments arising from industry-sponsored research should be centralized in institutional funds and not paid directly to researchers. And there should be transparency about the source and the purpose of the payment. Industry sponsorship of medical societies and their educational events should be kept to a minimum and declared quantitatively in societies' websites and scientific programme brochures. Industry sponsorship of scientific meetings should not include the right to host educational symposia or speakers within the programme. All speakers should declare their conflicts of interest (COIs) at their meetings. Guideline groups should require all members to declare their financial COIs before meeting and exclude or limit those members with COI. Governmental authorities should not allow continuing medical education credits to those educational events not complying with the above policies. The crucial role of medical journals as 'gatekeepers' for identifying 'science' must be reaffirmed. ? The Author 2017.

Research design and methods In a retrospective cohort study, we compared renal and patient survival among 263 patients with T2D who had native renal biopsies between 2002 and 2008 from three Auckland hospitals in New Zealand. The presence of diabetic nephropathy (DN), NDRD or mixed (DN and NDRD) was determined from biopsy. We examined clinical associations according to NDRD etiologies and mode of presentation—acute (defined by acute kidney injury (AKI)) or non-acute. Patients were followed until end-stage renal disease, death or December 2015. Survival was compared using Log-rank test. Results 94 (36%) patients had DN, 72 (27%) had NDRD, and 97 (37%) had mixed pathologies. Obesity-related focal segmental glomerulosclerosis was the most common NDRD (46%) in patients with non-acute presentations, whereas interstitial nephritis or immune-complex glomerulonephritides were the most prevalent in those with acute presentations (60%). DN was commonly associated with AKI (p<0.001). The prevalence of DN increased with diabetes duration (p<0.001), but NDRD was still found in 55% of subjects with ?14 years T2D. NDRD was strongly associated with the absence of retinopathy (p<0.001). Renal survival was best in the NDRD group (p<0.001). Among those with DN, renal prognosis was worse in those with more advanced DN lesions and those with an acute presentation (p<0.001). The proportion of all-cause mortality was similar in all three groups, but overall survival was poorest in the DN group (p=0.025). Conclusions Renal disease in patients with T2D is heterogeneous. The renal prognosis differs markedly according to histopathological diagnosis and mode of presentation. ?

Existing case definitions include paroxysmal cough, whooping, and posttussive vomiting, but diagnosis can be difficult. We determined the diagnostic accuracy of clinical characteristics of pertussis-associated cough. Methods We systematically searched CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and SCI-EXPANDED/CPCI-S up to June 2016. Eligible studies compared clinical characteristics in those positive and negative for Bordetella pertussis infection, confirmed by laboratory investigations. Two authors independently completed screening, data extraction, and quality and bias assessments. For each characteristic, RevMan was used to produce descriptive forest plots. The bivariate meta-analysis method was used to generate pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Results Of 1,969 identified papers, 53 were included. Forty-one clinical characteristics were assessed for diagnostic accuracy. In adult patients, paroxysmal cough and absence of fever have a high sensitivity (93.2% [CI, 83.2-97.4] and 81.8% [CI, 72.2-88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [CI, 14.7-28.1] and 18.8% [CI, 8.1-37.9]), whereas posttussive vomiting and whooping have low sensitivity (32.5% [CI, 24.5-41.6] and 29.8% [CI, 8.0-45.2]) and high specificity (77.7% [CI, 73.1-81.7] and 79.5% [CI, 69.4-86.9]). Posttussive vomiting in children is moderately sensitive (60.0% [CI, 40.3-77.0]) and specific (66.0% [CI, 52.5-77.3]). Conclusions In adult patients, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children, posttussive vomiting is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. ? 2017 American College of Chest Physicians",clinical decision-making; cough; infectious disease,"adult; Bordetella pertussis; child; Cough; differential diagnosis; human; meta analysis; Whooping Cough; Adult; Bordetella pertussis; Child; Cough; Diagnosis, Differential; Humans; Whooping Cough",2-s2.0-85027533408

This programme targeted indigenous people and those from most deprived households. Further, this cohort was compared with other populations/normative data. Methods This study examines baseline demographic data of an unblinded randomised controlled clinical trial. Participants (recruited from January 2012-August 2014) resided in Taranaki, New Zealand, and for this study we only included those with a body mass index (BMI) ?98th percentile (obese). HRQOL and psychological well-being were assessed using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL V.4.0 TM) (parent and child reports), and Achenbach's Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)/Youth Self Report (YSR). Results Assessments were undertaken for 233 participants (45% M? ori, 45% New Zealand European, 10% other ethnicities, 52% female, 30% from the most deprived household quintile), mean age 10.6 years. The mean BMI SD score (SDS) was 3.12 (range 2.01-5.34). Total PedsQL generic scaled score (parent) was lower (mean=63.4, SD 14.0) than an age-matched group of Australian children without obesity from the Health of Young Victorians study (mean=83.1, SD 12.5). In multivariable models, child and parental generic scaled scores decreased in older children (β=-0.70 and p=0.031, β=-0.64 and p=0.047, respectively). Behavioural difficulties (CBCL/YSR total score) were reported in 43.5% of participants, with the rate of emotional/behavioural difficulties six times higher than reported norms (p<0.001). Conclusions In this cohort, children and adolescents with obesity had a low HRQOL, and a concerning level of psychological difficulties, irrespective of ethnicity. Obesity itself rather than ethnicity or deprivation appeared to contribute to lower HRQOL scores. This study highlights the importance of psychologist involvement in obesity intervention programmes. ?

We hypothesize that late gadoliniumenhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (LGE-CMR) can be applied to define the fibrotic human SAN structure in vivo. Methods and results LGE-CMR atrial scans of healthy volunteers (n olu, 23-52 y.o.) using a 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging system with a spatial resolution of 1.0 mm3 or 0.625 × 0.625 × 1.25 mm3 were obtained and analysed. Percent fibrosis of total connective and cardiomyocyte tissue area in segmented atrial regions were measured based on signal intensity differences of fibrotic vs. non-fibrotic cardiomyocyte tissue. A distinct ellipsoidal fibrotic region (length: 23.6 ± 1.9 mm; width: 7.2 ± 0.9 mm; depth: 2.9 ± 0.4 mm) in all hearts was observed along the posterior junction of the crista terminalis and superior vena cava extending towards the interatrial septum, corresponding to the anatomical location of the human SAN. The SAN fibrotic region consisted of 41.9 ± 5.4% of LGE voxels above an average threshold of 2.7 SD (range 2-3 SD) from the non-fibrotic right atrial free wall tissue. Fibrosis quantification and SAN identification by in vivo LGE-CMR were validated in optically mapped explanted donor hearts ex vivo (n ivo, 19-65 y.o.) by contrast-enhanced CMR (9.4 Tesla; up to 90 mm3 resolution) correlated with serial histological sections of the SAN. Conclusion This is the first study to visualize the 3D human SAN fibrotic structure in vivo using LGE-CMR. Identification of the 3D SAN location and its high fibrotic content by LGE-CMR may provide a new tool to avoid or target SAN structure during ablation. ? 2017 The Author.",Fibrosis; Human atria; Late gadolinium-enhanced CMR; Optical mapping; Sinoatrial node,"gadolinium pentetate meglumine; gadoteridol; contrast medium; gadolinium; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; connective tissue; contrast enhancement; controlled study; ex vivo study; female; heart muscle fibrosis; human; human experiment; human tissue; in vivo study; interatrial septum; male; normal human; priority journal; sinus node; tissue section; cine magnetic resonance imaging; diagnostic imaging; fibrosis; image enhancement; middle aged; pathology; predictive value; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; sinus node; young adult; Adult; Contrast Media; Female; Fibrosis; Gadolinium; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiographic Image Enhancement; Sensitivity and Specificity; Sinoatrial Node; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85020925761

The kidney collects metabolic waste using a blood filter with specialized epithelial cells known as podocytes. Podocyte formation is poorly understood but relevant to many kidney diseases, as podocyte injury leads to progressive scarring and organ failure. zeppelin (zep) was isolated in a forward screen for kidney mutants and identified as a homozygous recessive lethal allele that causes reduced podocyte numbers, deficient filtration, and fluid imbalance. Interestingly, zep mutants had a larger interrenal gland, the teleostean counterpart of the mammalian adrenal gland, which suggested a fate switch with the related podocyte lineage since cell proliferation and cell death were unchanged within the shared progenitor field from which these two identities arise. Cloning of zep by whole genome sequencing (WGS) identified a splicing mutation in breast cancer 2, early onset (brca2)/fancd1, which was confirmed by sequencing of individual fish. Several independent brca2 morpholinos (MOs) phenocopied zep, causing edema, reduced podocyte number, and increased interrenal cell number. Complementation analysis between zep and brca2ZM_00057434 -/- zebrafish, which have an insertional mutation, revealed that the interrenal lineage was expanded. Importantly, overexpression of brca2 rescued podocyte formation in zep mutants, providing critical evidence that the brca2 lesion encoded by zep specifically disrupts the balance of nephrogenesis. Taken together, these data suggest for the first time that brca2/fancd1 is essential for vertebrate kidney ontogeny. Thus, our findings impart novel insights into the genetic components that impact renal development, and because BRCA2/FANCD1 mutations in humans cause Fanconi anemia and several common cancers, this work has identified a new zebrafish model to further study brca2/fancd1 in disease. ? 2017 The Authors",brca2/fancd1; Glomerulus; Interrenal; Kidney; Podocyte; Pronephros; Zebrafish,"BRCA2 protein; morpholino oligonucleotide; BRCA2 protein; brca2 protein, zebrafish; morpholino oligonucleotide; zebrafish protein; allele; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell count; cell death; cell expansion; cell loss; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; edema; electrolyte disturbance; embryo; embryo development; filtration deficiency; fluid imbalance; gene; gene function; gene mutation; gene overexpression; gene silencing; insertional mutation; kidney development; kidney disease; mutant; nonhuman; ontogeny; podocyte; priority journal; pronephros; splicing mutation; tumor suppressor gene; whole genome sequencing; zebra fish; zeppelin gene; animal; cell differentiation; cytology; disease model; embryology; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene expression regulation; genetics; molecular cloning; organogenesis; pronephros; transgenic animal; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; BRCA2 Protein; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cloning, Molecular; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Morpholinos; Organogenesis; Podocytes; Pronephros; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-85020798027

The available data suggest that GH expression by tumour cells is associated with the aetiology and progression of various cancers such as endometrial, breast, liver, prostate, and colon cancer. Accordingly there has been increased interest in targeting GH-mediated signal transduction in a therapeutic setting. Because GH has endocrine, autocrine, and paracrine actions, therapeutic strategies will need to take into account systemic and local functions. Activation of related hormone receptors and crosstalk with other signalling pathways are also key considerations. The evidence indicates that GH exerts not only endocrine effects but also autocrine/paracrine effects through local tumour expression. Expression of GH by tumour cells is associated with reduced survival and local metastasis in patients with breast, endometrial, and liver cancer. Autocrine GH enhances multiple aspects of cancer progression and promotes a cancer stem cell-like phenotype. Antagonism of GH signal transduction reduces tumour growth and sensitises to radiotherapy in preclinical studies. Therapeutic use of GH antagonism in cancer need not be restricted to GH-positive tumours because GH-negative cancer cells may be more sensitive to systemic GH stimulation. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",acromegaly; cancer; cancer stem cells; growth hormone; IGF1,"human growth hormone; antineoplastic agent; human growth hormone; IGF1 protein, human; somatomedin C; autocrine effect; cancer epidemiology; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; drug targeting; growth hormone release; hormone action; human; malignant neoplasm; paracrine signaling; priority journal; Review; adenoma; animal; drug effects; female; growth hormone secreting adenoma; male; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; physiology; procedures; secretion (process); signal transduction; trends; Adenoma; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Female; Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Male; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85020662125

The present review summarizes its pharmacology and current experience with the drug. Recent findings Dexmedetomidine is proving useful in many diverse areas in paediatric anaesthesia where its sedative properties are useful for premedication, fibreoptic intubation and radiologic procedures. Its use as an adjunct for balanced anaesthesia where it can decrease the use of other drugs, reduce emergence delirium, postoperative shivering and vomiting. Muted apoptotic neuroprotective effects may realize benefits in neonates. Cardiac conduction delay, an adverse effect, may prove beneficial for arrhythmias after congenital cardiac surgery. Summary Most of the paediatric published studies concerning dexmedetomidine are observational in nature, with limited control groups or comparators. Adverse effects (e.g. bradycardia) still require greater scrutiny in the paediatric population and particularly with respect to different age groups.

Design Inception cohort study over 4 years. Setting General community. Participants Adults (N=245; >16y at the time of injury) who experienced a mild TBI and who were employed prior to their injury. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Details of the injury, demographic information, and preinjury employment status were collected from medical records and self-report. Symptoms and mood were assessed 1 month postinjury using the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Postinjury employment status and work productivity were assessed 4 years postinjury using the Work Limitations Questionnaire. Results Four years after mild TBI, 17.3% of participants had exited the workforce (other than for reasons of retirement or to study) or had reduced their working hours compared with preinjury. A further 15.5% reported experiencing limitations at work because of their injury. Average work productivity loss was 3.6%. The symptom of taking longer to think 1 month postinjury significantly predicted work productivity loss 4 years later (β=.47, t=3.79, P?.001). Conclusions Although changes in employment status and difficulties at work are likely over time, the results indicate increased unemployment rates, work limitations, and productivity loss in the longer term after a mild TBI.

The aims of this study are to (i) characterize older people who present with self-harm to emergency departments (EDs); and (ii) determine the predictors for repeat self-harm and suicide. Methods: Demographic and clinical data were retrospectively collected on older people (age 65+ years), who presented to seven EDs in New Zealand following an episode of self-harm between 1st July 2010 and 30th June 2013. In addition, 12-month follow-up information on repeat self-harm and suicide was collected. Results: The sample included 339 older people (55.2% female) with an age range of 65-96 years (mean age = 75.0; SD = 7.6). Overdose (68.7%) was the most common method of self-harm. 76.4% of the self-harm cases were classified as suicide attempts. Perceived physical illness (47.8%) and family discord (34.5%) were the most common stressors. 12.7% of older people repeated self-harm and 2.1% died by suicide within 12 months. Older people who had a positive blood alcohol reading (OR = 3.87, 95% Cl = 1.35-11.12, p = 0.012) and were already with mental health services at the index self-harm (OR = 2.73, 95% Cl = 1.20-6.25, p = 0.047) were more likely to repeat self-harm/suicide within 12 months. Conclusion: Older people who self-harm are at very high risk of repeat self-harm and suicide. Screening and assessment for alcohol use disorders should be routinely performed following a self-harm presentation, along with providing structured psychological treatment as an adjunct to pharmacological treatment for depression and interventions to improve the person's resilience resources. ? 2017 International Psychogeriatric Association.",older people; self-harm; suicide; suicide attempt,"alcohol; aged; alcohol blood level; Article; automutilation; demography; emergency ward; female; follow up; geriatric disorder; human; intoxication; major clinical study; male; mental health service; New Zealand; physical disease; prediction; retrospective study; risk factor; suicide attempt; automutilation; drug overdose; hospital emergency service; risk assessment; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; suicide; time factor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Drug Overdose; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mental Health Services; New Zealand; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Self-Injurious Behavior; Suicide; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85016235072

Background: To assess patient characteristics and outcomes of contemporary phacoemulsification cataract surgery in a New Zealand public teaching hospital setting. Design: Prospective observational study. Participants: Consecutive cases (n?=?500) of phacoemulsification surgery between April and June 2015. Methods: An independent observer assessed clinical and surgical data preoperatively and 4–6?weeks postoperatively. Main Outcome Measures: Visual acuity, intraoperative and postoperative complications. Results: Mean age was 72.3?±?11.9?years and 57% female. Mean preoperative best-measured visual acuity was 6/30. Ocular comorbidity was present in 45.8% of eyes, most commonly glaucoma (10%), age-related macular degeneration (8%) and diabetic retinopathy (8%). Systemically, hypertension (59%) and diabetes mellitus (31%) were prevalent. Mean contralateral best-measured visual acuity was 6/12 (n?=?495) with 62% being phakic. The rate of posterior capsular tear was 2.6% and cystoid macular oedema 3.5%. Intraoperative complication rates were not significantly different between surgeon levels (P?=?0.234). However, registrars had fewer postoperative complications than fellows (2.2% vs. 11.9%, P?=?0.012). Postoperatively, mean unaided and best-measured visual acuity were 6/12 and 6/9. Conclusions and Relevance: This study reports current phacoemulsification surgery outcomes in a major public teaching institution. A large proportion of patients exhibited systemic and ocular comorbidities, relatively dense cataracts and poor presenting visual acuity. However, visual outcomes and intraoperative complication rates were not statistically different between trainees and senior surgeons.

LSG includes excision of the normal gastric pacemaker, which could induce electrical dysrhythmias impacting on post-operative symptoms and recovery, but these implications have not been adequately investigated. This study aimed to define the effects of LSG on gastric slow-wave pacemaking using laparoscopic high-resolution (HR) electrical mapping. Methods: Laparoscopic HR mapping was performed before and after LSG using flexible printed circuit arrays (64–96 electrodes; 8–12?cm2; n?=?8 patients) deployed through a 12?mm trocar and positioned on the gastric serosa. An additional patient with chronic reflux, nausea, and dysmotility 6?months after LSG also underwent gastric mapping while undergoing conversion to gastric bypass. Slow-wave activity was quantified by propagation pattern, frequency, velocity, and amplitude. Results: Baseline activity showed exclusively normal propagation. Acutely after LSG, all patients developed either a distal unifocal ectopic pacemaker with retrograde propagation (50%) or bioelectrical quiescence (50%). Propagation velocity was abnormally rapid after LSG (12.5?±?0.8 vs baseline 3.8?±?0.8?mm?s?1; p?=?0.01), whereas frequency and amplitude were unchanged (2.7?±?0.3 vs 2.8?±?0.3?cpm, p?=?0.7; 1.7?±?0.2 vs 1.6?±?0.6?mV, p?=?0.7). In the patient with chronic dysmotility after LSG, mapping also revealed a stable antral ectopic pacemaker with retrograde rapid propagation (12.6?±?4.8?mm?s?1). Conclusion: Resection of the gastric pacemaker during LSG acutely resulted in aberrant distal ectopic pacemaking or bioelectrical quiescence. Ectopic pacemaking can persist long after LSG, inducing chronic dysmotility. The clinical and therapeutic significance of these findings now require further investigation. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Gastric dysrhythmia; Gastric motility; Gastroesophageal reflux; Interstitial cells of Cajal; Obesity surgery,"abdominal cavity; adult; Article; clinical article; comparative study; digestive device; ectopic gastric pacemaking; female; gastric bypass surgery; gastric dysmotility; gastric pacemaker; gastroesophageal reflux; high resolution flexible printed circuit array; human; laparoscopic high resolution electrical mapping; laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy; laparoscopy; male; medical device complication; nausea; peristalsis; postoperative complication; priority journal; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; serosa; software; stomach examination; stomach pH electrode; surgical patient; trocar; biological rhythm; clinical trial; electrophysiology; electrostimulation; gastrectomy; gastroesophageal reflux; gastrointestinal disease; gastrointestinal motility; laparoscopy; middle aged; morbid obesity; nausea; pathophysiology; physiology; postoperative complication; procedures; stomach; Adult; Biological Clocks; Electric Stimulation; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Female; Gastrectomy; Gastric Bypass; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Gastrointestinal Motility; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Nausea; Obesity, Morbid; Postoperative Complications; Stomach",2-s2.0-85013054761

Polyphenols are antioxidants that have been noted to hinder training adaptations, yet conversely they stimulate stress-related cell signalling pathways that trigger mitochondrial biogenesis and influence vascular function. Objective: To determine the overall effect of polyphenols on human athletic performance. Methods: A search strategy was completed using MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, AMED and SPORTDiscus in April 2016. The studies were screened and independently reviewed by two researchers against predetermined criteria for eligibility. As a result of this screening, 14 studies were included for meta-analysis. Of these, the studied populations were predominately-trained males with an average intervention dose of 688?±?478?mg·day?1. Results: The pooled results demonstrate polyphenol supplementation for at least 7?days increases performance by 1.90% (95% CI 0.40–3.39). Sub-analysis of seven studies using quercetin identified a performance increase of 2.82% (95% CI 2.05–3.58). There were no adverse effects reported in the studies in relation to the intervention. Conclusion: Overall the pooled results show that polyphenols, and of note quercetin, are viable supplements to improve performance in healthy individuals. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,antioxidant; polyphenol; quercetin; athletic performance; chemistry; dietary supplement; human; male; meta analysis; oxidative stress; physiology; Antioxidants; Athletic Performance; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Male; Oxidative Stress; Polyphenols; Quercetin,2-s2.0-85009756594

This may affect up to a quarter of all couples planning a child. It is estimated that for 40% to 50% of couples, subfertility may result from factors affecting women. Antioxidants are thought to reduce the oxidative stress brought on by these conditions. Currently, limited evidence suggests that antioxidants improve fertility, and trials have explored this area with varied results. This review assesses the evidence for the effectiveness of different antioxidants in female subfertility. Objectives To determinewhether supplementary oral antioxidants comparedwith placebo, no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant improve fertility outcomes for subfertile women. Search methods We searched the following databases (from their inception to September 2016) with no language or date restriction: Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group (CGFG) specialised register, the Cochrane Central Register of Studies (CENTRAL CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and AMED. We checked reference lists of appropriate studies and searched for ongoing trials in the clinical trials registers. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared any type, dose or combination of oral antioxidant supplement with placebo, no treatment or treatment with another antioxidant, among women attending a reproductive clinic. We excluded trials comparing antioxidants with fertility drugs alone and trials that only included fertile women attending a fertility clinic because of male partner infertility. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently selected eligible studies, extracted the data and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. The primary review outcome was live birth; secondary outcomes included clinical pregnancy rates and adverse events. We pooled studies using a fixed-effect model, and calculated odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the dichotomous outcomes of live birth, clinical pregnancy and adverse events. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence by applying GRADE criteria. Main results We included 50 trials involving 6510 women. Investigators compared oral antioxidants, including combinations of antioxidants, Nacetyl-cysteine, melatonin, L-arginine, myo-inositol, D-chiro-inositol, carnitine, selenium, vitamin E, vitamin B complex, vitamin C, vitamin D+calcium, CoQ10, pentoxifylline and omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids versus placebo, no treatment/standard treatment or another antioxidant. Very low-quality evidence suggests that antioxidants may be associated with an increased live birth rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (OR 2.13, 95% CI 1.45 to 3.12, P > 0.001, 8 RCTs, 651 women, I2 = 47%). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected live birth rate of 20%, the rate among women using antioxidants would be between 26% and 43%. Very low-quality evidence suggests that antioxidants may be associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate compared with placebo or no treatment/standard treatment (OR 1.52, 95% CI 1.31 to 1.76, P < 0.001, 26 RCTs, 4271 women, I2 = 66%). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected clinical pregnancy rate of 22%, the rate among women using antioxidants would be between 27% and 33%. Heterogeneity was moderately high. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of miscarriage (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.08, P = 0.14, 18 RCTs, 2834 women, I2 = 23%, very low quality evidence). This suggests that, among subfertile women with an expected miscarriage rate of 7%, use of antioxidants would be expected to result in a miscarriage rate of between 4% and 7%. There was also insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of multiple pregnancy (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.38, P = 0.98, 8 RCTs, 2163 women, I2 = 4%, very low quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected multiple pregnancy rate of 8%, use of antioxidants would be expected to result in a multiple pregnancy rate between 6%and 11%. Likewise, there was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of gastrointestinal disturbances (OR 1.55, 95% CI 0.47 to 5.10, P = 0.47, 3 RCTs, 343 women, I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected gastrointestinal disturbance rate of 2%, use of antioxidants would be expected to result in a rate between 1% and 11%. Overall adverse events were reported by 35 trials in the meta-analysis, but there was insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions. Only one trial reported on live birth, clinical pregnancy or adverse effects in the antioxidant versus antioxidant comparison, and no conclusions could be drawn. Very low-quality evidence suggests that pentoxifylline may be associated with an increased clinical pregnancy rate compared with placebo or no treatment (OR 2.07, 95%CI 1.20 to 3.56, P = 0.009, 3 RCTs, 276 women, I2 = 0%). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected clinical pregnancy rate of 25%, the rate among women using pentoxifylline would be between 28% and 53%. There was insufficient evidence to determine whether there was a difference between the groups in rates of miscarriage (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.46 to 3.90, P = 0.58, 3 RCTs, 276 women, I2 = 0%) or multiple pregnancy (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.20 to 3.09, one RCT, 112 women, very low quality evidence). This suggests that among subfertile women with an expected miscarriage rate of 4%, the rate among women using pentoxifylline would be between 2% and 15%. For multiple pregnancy, the data suggest that among subfertile women with an expected multiple pregnancy rate of 9%, the rate among women using pentoxifylline would be between 2% and 23%. The overall quality of evidence was limited by serious risk of bias associated with poor reporting of methods, imprecision and inconsistency. Authors' conclusions In this review, there was very low-quality evidence to show that taking an antioxidant may provide benefit for subfertile women, but insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about adverse events. At this time, there is limited evidence in support of supplemental oral antioxidants for subfertile women. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"acetylcysteine; alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; arginine; ascorbic acid; calcium; carnitine; chiro inositol; inositol derivative; melatonin; omega 3 fatty acid; pentoxifylline; selenium; ubidecarenone; unclassified drug; vitamin B complex; vitamin D; antioxidant; pentoxifylline; Article; endometriosis; female subfertility; fetus malformation; gestational age; human; hydrosalpinx; in vitro fertilization; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; intrauterine insemination; multiple pregnancy; ovary polycystic disease; oxidative stress; population research; practice guideline; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; spontaneous abortion; systematic review; Abortion, Spontaneous; female; Infertility, Female; live birth; meta analysis; oral drug administration; pregnancy; pregnancy rate; randomized controlled trial (topic); Abortion, Spontaneous; Administration, Oral; Antioxidants; Female; Humans; Infertility, Female; Live Birth; Oxidative Stress; Pentoxifylline; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Rate; Pregnancy, Multiple; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",2-s2.0-85026450932

Although risks and benefits are associated with both elective repeat caesarean birth and planned induction of labour, current sources of information are limited to non-randomised cohort studies, and studies designed in this way have significant potential for bias. Consequently, any conclusions based on results of these studies are limited in their reliability and should be interpreted with caution. Objectives To assess, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of a policy of planned elective repeat caesarean section versus a policy of induction of labour for women with a previous caesarean birth who require induction of labour for a subsequent pregnancy. Primary outcomes include success of induction of labour, need for caesarean section, maternal and neonatal mortality, and maternal and neonatal morbidity. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Trials Register (31 May 2017) and planned to search reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria Randomised controlled trials with reported data on comparison of outcomes in mothers and babies between women who planned an elective repeat caesarean section and women who planned induction of labour when a previous birth was performed by caesarean. Cluster trials and quasi-randomised trials were also eligible for inclusion. We would consider trials published only as abstracts if they provided enough information to meet review inclusion criteria. Data collection and analysis We performed no data extraction. For future updates, if randomised controlled trials are identified, two reviewauthorswill independently assess trials for inclusion and risk of bias, and will extract data and check extracted data for accuracy. Review authors will assess the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results Review authors identified no randomised controlled trials. Authors' conclusions Both planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned induction of labour for women with a prior caesarean birth are associated with benefits and harms. Evidence for these care practices has been drawn from non-randomised studies, which are associated with potential bias. Therefore, any results and conclusions presented must be interpreted with caution. Randomised controlled trials are required to provide the most reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of both planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned induction of labour for women with a previous caesarean birth. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"adult respiratory distress syndrome; Article; birth injury; bladder injury; bleeding; brain disease; cerebrovascular accident; consciousness disorder; deep vein thrombosis; dilation and evacuation; evidence based practice; female; fetus distress; fistula; human; hysterectomy; intestine obstruction; labor induction; laceration; lung edema; lung embolism; maternal death; maternal morbidity; maternal mortality; necrotizing enterocolitis; newborn morbidity; newborn mortality; paralytic ileus; pneumonia; postnatal depression; pregnancy; priority journal; puerperal infection; randomized controlled trial (topic); repeat cesarean section; respiratory tract disease; risk benefit analysis; systematic review; tachypnea; uterus rupture; wound dehiscence; wound infection; elective surgery; pregnancy; vaginal birth after cesarean; Cesarean Section, Repeat; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Labor, Induced; Pregnancy; Vaginal Birth after Cesarean",2-s2.0-85025824053

While the pathogenesis of preeclampsia remains unclear, it is known that placenta-derived factors trigger the disease by activating maternal endothelial cells prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. Extracellular vesicles (EVs) of different sizes extruded by the placenta may be one factor. The truncated/secreted form of Flt-1 (sFlt-1) has also been implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. We investigated whether placental EV production is altered in preeclampsia such that they induce endothelial cell activation, and whether (s)Flt-1 is involved. Methods: Macro-, micro-, and nano-vesicles were collected from normal and preeclamptic (PE) placental explants, and separated by differential centrifugation. The number and size of micro- and nano-vesicles was measured by nanoparticle tracking analysis and their ability to activate endothelial cells was quantified by endothelial cell intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression and monocyte adhesion. The levels of Flt-1 were measured by western blots and ELISA. Results: PE placentae extruded significantly more micro- and nano-vesicles than control placentae and the extruded micro-vesicles were larger than those from control placentae. Micro- and nano-vesicles from both first trimester and term human placentae carried Flt-1 and levels were significantly increased in EVs from severe, but not mild, PE compared to normotensive placentae. All fractions of EVs from PE placentae activated endothelial cells, and for micro- and nano-vesicles, activation was reduced in the presence of exogenous vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a Flt-1 neutralizing antibody, or by pre-treatment with VEGF. While EV-bound VEGF constituted over 20% of the total detected VEGF secreted by PE and normotensive placentae, EV-bound Flt-1 did not significantly contribute to the total level of sFlt-1/Flt-1 released by human third trimester placentae. Discussion: Micro- and nano-vesicles extruded by human placentae carry Flt-1 across gestation and in severe preeclampsia, the levels of vesicle-bound Flt-1 are upregulated. All fractions of PE placental EVs activated endothelial cells and for micro- and nano-vesicles, this was in part due to the ability of EV-bound Flt-1 to sequester VEGF. That placental EVs can activate endothelial cells supports the contention that EVs are one placental toxin contributing to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. ? 2017 Tong, Chen, James, Stone and Chamley.","Endothelial dysfunction; Exosome, vesicle; Particle; Preeclampsia; Trophoblast; Vascular endothelial growth factor",intercellular adhesion molecule 1; nanoparticle; Article; cell activation; cell adhesion assay; cell fractionation; cell surface; cell vacuole; controlled study; endothelium cell; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exosome; first trimester pregnancy; human; human cell; hypertension; monocyte; placenta; preeclampsia; pregnancy; systolic blood pressure; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85025619843

The compounds incorporate 13 different amine-containing side chains designed to bind in the minor groove of DNA while spanning a wide range of base strength from pKa 9.64 to 5.24. The most favorable in vitro properties were associated with strongly basic side chains, but the greatest in vivo antitumor activity was found for compounds containing a weakly basic morpholine. This applies to single-agent activity and for activity in combination with irradiation or chemotherapy (gemcitabine or docetaxel). In combination with a single dose of γ irradiation 50 at 42 μmol/kg eliminated detectable clonogens in some SiHa cervical carcinoma xenografts, and in combination with gemcitabine using a well-tolerated multidose schedule, the same compound caused regression of all treated A2780 ovarian tumor xenografts.

These negative behaviours can have a significant impact on the health and particularly mental health of those involved in such behaviours, both as victims and as bullies. This UK study aims to investigate student-level and school-level characteristics of those who become involved in bullying and cyberbullying behaviours as victims or perpetrators. Methods: We used data from 6667 Year 7 students from the baseline survey of a cluster randomized trial in 40 English schools to investigate the associations between individual-level and school-level variables with bullying victimization, cyberbullying perpetration, and cyberbullying victimization. We ran multilevel models to examine associations of bullying outcomes with individual-level variables and school-level variables. Results: In multilevel models, at the school level, school type and school quality measures were associated with bullying risk: students in voluntary-aided schools were less likely to report bullying victimization (0.6 (0.4, 0.9) p = 0.008), and those in community (3.9 (1.5, 10.5) p = 0.007) and foundation (4.0 (1.6, 9.9) p = 0.003) schools were more likely to report being perpetrators of cyberbullying than students in mainstream academies. A school quality rating of ""Good"" was associated with greater reported bullying victimization (1.3 (1.02, 1.5) p = 0.03) compared to ratings of ""Outstanding."" Conclusions: Bullying victimization and cyberbullying prevalence vary across school type and school quality, supporting the hypothesis that organisational/management factors within the school may have an impact on students' behaviour. These findings will inform future longitudinal research investigating which school factors and processes promote or prevent bullying and cyberbullying behaviours.

In an effort to shift the current paradigm in dose and regimen selection and highlight the availability and usefulness of well-established and regulatory-acceptable methods, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in collaboration with the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries Association (EFPIA) hosted a multistakeholder workshop on dose finding (London 4-5 December 2014). Some methodologies that could constitute a toolkit for drug developers and regulators were presented. These methods are described in the present report: they include five advanced methods for data analysis (empirical regression models, pharmacometrics models, quantitative systems pharmacology models, MCP-Mod, and model averaging) and three methods for study design optimization (Fisher information matrix (FIM)-based methods, clinical trial simulations, and adaptive studies). Pairwise comparisons were also discussed during the workshop; however, mostly for historical reasons. This paper discusses the added value and limitations of these methods as well as challenges for their implementation. Some applications in different therapeutic areas are also summarized, in line with the discussions at the workshop. There was agreement at the workshop on the fact that selection of dose for phase III is an estimation problem and should not be addressed via hypothesis testing. Dose selection for phase III trials should be informed by well-designed dosefinding studies; however, the specific choice of method(s) will depend on several aspects and it is not possible to recommend a generalized decision tree. There are many valuable methods available, the methods are not mutually exclusive, and they should be used in conjunction to ensure a scientifically rigorous understanding of the dosing rationale. ? 2017 ASCPT All rights reserved.",,"cabozantinib; osimertinib; drug; area under the curve; Article; blood pressure; dose calculation; drug development; drug dose regimen; dynamics; forced expiratory volume; human; maximum tolerated dose; meta analysis (topic); minimum inhibitory concentration; nonhuman; pharmacodynamics; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); animal; clinical trial (topic); dose response; methodology; theoretical model; Animals; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Discovery; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Research Design",2-s2.0-85025085004

It is defined as a malevolent course of conduct involving fathers’ use of custody and/or child protection proceedings to overturn historic patterns of care for children. The experience of custody stalking is explored through three composite narratives derived from twelve mothers who participated in an exploratory, qualitative study on the involuntary loss of maternal care time following separation. The losses suffered caused these mothers tremendous grief, damaged their psychological wellbeing and had a detrimental effect on their mothering relationships. Yet custody stalking, as a form of malevolent attack, is not well recognised and mothers’ resultant losses are largely culturally invisible. This is in marked contrast to paternal filicides, another form of post-separation avenging attack committed by some fathers that also leads to maternal loss experiences, albeit more absolute. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Coercive control; Custody stalking; Harassment; Intimate partner violence; Post-separation,,2-s2.0-85023206114

Here, the role of SIRT1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and serum-induced SIRT1 protein expression (a novel assay that detects circulating factors that influence SIRT1 expression in vitro) were studied in the Concord Health and Ageing in Men Project (CHAMP), a prospective cohort of community dwelling men aged 70 years and older. Serum-induced SIRT1 expression was not associated with age or mortality, however participants within the lowest quintile were less likely to be frail (odds ratio (OR) 0.34, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.17-0.69, N = 1,309). Serum-induced SIRT1 expression was associated with some markers of body composition and nutrition (height, weight, body fat and lean % mass, albumin, and cholesterol) but not disease. SIRT1 SNPs rs2273773, rs3740051, and rs3758391 showed no association with age, frailty, or mortality but were associated with weight, height, body fat and lean, and albumin levels. There were some weak associations between SIRT1 SNPs and arthritis, heart attack, deafness, and cognitive impairment. There was no association between SIRT1 SNPs and the serum-induced SIRT1 assay. SIRT1 SNPs and serum-induced SIRT1 expression in older men may be more closely associated with nutrition and body composition than aging and age-related conditions. ?

Despite the identification of multiple isoforms of ANRIL, expression of certain transcripts has been found to be tissue-specific and the characterisation of ANRIL transcripts remains incomplete. Several functions have been associated with ANRIL. In our judgement, studies on ANRIL functionality are premature pending a more complete appreciation of the profusion of isoforms. We found differential expression of ANRIL exons, which indicates that multiple isoforms exist in melanoma cells. In addition to linear isoforms, we identified circular forms of ANRIL (circANRIL). Further characterisation of circANRIL in two patient-derived metastatic melanoma cell lines (NZM7 and NZM37) revealed the existence of a rich assortment of circular isoforms. Moreover, in the two melanoma cell lines investigated, the complements of circANRIL isoforms were almost completely different. Novel exons were also discovered. We also found the family of linear ANRIL was enriched in the nucleus, whilst the circular isoforms were enriched in the cytoplasm and they differed markedly in stability. With respect to the variable processing of circANRIL species, bioinformatic analysis indicated that intronic Arthrobacter luteus (Alu) restriction endonuclease inverted repeats and exon skipping were not involved in selection of back-spliced exon junctions. Based on our findings, we hypothesise that “ANRIL” has wholly distinct dual sets of functions in melanoma. This reveals the dynamic nature of the locus and constitutes a basis for investigating the functions of ANRIL in melanoma. ? 2017 by the authors.

Various feedback mechanisms or “brakes” have been proposed. While duodenal, jejunal, and ileal brakes are well described, a putative distal colonic brake is less well defined. Despite the high prevalence of colonic motility disorders, there is little knowledge of colonic motility owing to difficulties with organ access and technical difficulties in recording detailed motor patterns along its entire length. The motility of the colon is not under voluntary control. A wide range of motor patterns is seen, with long intervals of intestinal quiescence between them. In addition, the use of traditional manometric catheters to record contractile activity of the colon has been limited by the low number of widely spaced sensors, which has resulted in the misinterpretation of colonic motor patterns. The recent advent of high-resolution (HR) manometry is revolutionising the understanding of gastrointestinal motor patterns. It has now been observed that the most common motor patterns in the colon are repetitive two to six cycles per minute (cpm) propagating events in the distal colon. These motor patterns are prominent soon after a meal, originate most frequently in the rectosigmoid region, and travel in the retrograde direction. The distal prominence and the origin of these motor patterns raise the possibility of them serving as a braking mechanism, or the “rectosigmoid brake,” to limit rectal filling. This review aims to describe what is known about the “rectosigmoid brake,” including its physiological and clinical significance and potential therapeutic applications. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",colon; gastrointestinal motility; gastrointestinal tract; high-resolution manometry; rectosigmoid brake,chronic constipation; feces incontinence; feedback system; frequency; functional anatomy; human; intestinal dysmotility; intestine contraction; neuromodulation; nomenclature; postoperative ileus; rectosigmoid brake; rectum; Review; sacral nerve stimulation; sigmoid; animal; colon; enteropathy; gastrointestinal motility; nervous system; pathophysiology; rectum; Animals; Colon; Gastrointestinal Motility; Humans; Intestinal Diseases; Nervous System; Rectum,2-s2.0-85021329803

We hypothesised that inflammation accelerates senescence and thereby enhances the risk of cardiovascular disease in gout. Methods: We assessed replicative senescence by quantifying telomere length (TL) in a discovery cohort of 145 Dutch patients with gout and 273 healthy individuals and validated our results in 474 patients with gout and 293 healthy participants from New Zealand. Subsequently, we investigated the effect of cardiovascular disease on TL of all participants. Also, we measured TL of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, monocytes, natural killer cells and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Additionally, we assessed the potential temporal difference in TL and telomerase activity. Results: TL in PBMCs of healthy donors decreased over time, reflecting normal ageing. Patients with gout demonstrated shorter telomeres (p=0.001, R2 =0.01873). In fact, the extent of telomere erosion in patients with gout was higher at any age compared with healthy counterparts at any age (p&lt;0.0001, R2 =0.02847). Patients with gout with cardiovascular disease had the shortest telomeres and TL was an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease in patients with gout (p=0.001). TL was inversely associated with the number of gouty flares (p=0.005). Conclusions: Patients with gout have shorter telomeres than healthy participants, reflecting increased cellular senescence. Telomere shortening was associated with the number of flares and with cardiovascular disease in people with gout. ? 2017 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",Cardiovascular Disease; Gout; Inflammation,"allopurinol; colchicine; corticosteroid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; telomerase; telomerase; TERT protein, human; adult; Article; B lymphocyte; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; disease exacerbation; Dutchman; enzyme activity; female; genetic association; genetic erosion; gout; human; human cell; inflammation; major clinical study; male; monocyte; natural killer cell; New Zealand; plasmacytoid dendritic cell; priority journal; risk factor; senescence; telomere length; telomere shortening; validation study; aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; case control study; dendritic cell; disease course; genetics; gout; metabolism; middle aged; statistical model; telomere; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; B-Lymphocytes; Cardiovascular Diseases; Case-Control Studies; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Dendritic Cells; Disease Progression; Female; Gout; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Monocytes; Telomerase; Telomere",2-s2.0-85020579456

The M?ori and Pacific (Polynesian) population of New Zealand has the highest prevalence of gout worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine whether any Polynesian population–specific genetic variants in SLC22A6–8 and ABCC4 are associated with gout. Methods: All participants had ?3 self-reported M?ori and/or Pacific grandparents. Among the total sample set of 1,808 participants, 191 hyperuricemic and 202 normouricemic individuals were resequenced over the 4 genes, and the remaining 1,415 individuals were used for replication. Regression analyses were performed, adjusting for age, sex, and Polynesian ancestry. To study the functional effect of nonsynonymous variants of ABCC4, transport assays were performed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Results: A total of 39 common variants were detected, with an ABCC4 variant (rs4148500) significantly associated with hyperuricemia and gout. This variant was monomorphic for the urate-lowering allele in Europeans. There was evidence for an association of rs4148500 with gout in the resequenced samples (odds ratio [OR] 1.62 [P = 0.012]) that was replicated (OR 1.25 [P = 0.033]) and restricted to men (OR 1.43 [P = 0.001] versus OR 0.98 [P = 0.89] in women). The gout risk allele was associated with fractional excretion of uric acid in male individuals (β = ?0.570 [P = 0.01]). A rare population-specific allele (P1036L) with predicted strong functional consequence reduced the uric acid transport activity of ABCC4 by 30%. Conclusion: An association between ABCC4 and gout and fractional excretion of uric acid is consistent with the established role of MRP4 as a unidirectional renal uric acid efflux pump. ? 2017, American College of Rheumatology",,"breast cancer resistance protein; creatinine; multidrug resistance associated protein 4; organic anion transporter 1; organic anion transporter 2; organic anion transporter 3; urate; uric acid; ABCC4 protein, human; multidrug resistance protein; organic anion transporter; organic anion transporter 1; organic anion transporter 3; SLC22A7 protein, human; uric acid; 3' untranslated region; 5' untranslated region; adult; allele; animal cell; Article; chromosome 13; controlled study; female; gene frequency; gene identification; gene linkage disequilibrium; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; genome analysis; genotype; gout; human; hyperuricemia; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); New Zealand; nonhuman; oocyte; Polynesian; population genetics; priority journal; protein expression; single nucleotide polymorphism; transport assay; uric acid blood level; urinary excretion fraction; Western blotting; Xenopus laevis; animal; case control study; DNA sequence; genetics; gout; metabolism; middle aged; Oceanic ancestry group; statistical model; urine; Adult; Animals; Blotting, Western; Case-Control Studies; Female; Gout; Humans; Hyperuricemia; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Oocytes; Organic Anion Transport Protein 1; Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Independent; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Uric Acid; Xenopus laevis",2-s2.0-85020018644

The purpose of ovarian stimulation is to facilitate retrieval of multiple oocytes during a single IVF cycle. Availability of multiple oocytes compensates for inefficiencies in subsequent stages of the cycle, which include oocyte maturation, IVF, embryo culture, embryo transfer, and implantation. Multiple embryos can be transferred in most women, and spare embryos can be frozen to allow for future chances of pregnancy without the need for repeated ovarian stimulation and oocyte retrieval. Our evidence synthesis team addressed 10 clinical questions on management of ovarian stimulation for IVF, prepared a narrative review of the evidence and drafted recommendations to be considered through WHO guideline development processes.

The torque-displacement characteristics of the soft elastomeric core contained within the joint are modeled. This knowledge is used in conjunction with a dynamic system model to derive a sliding mode controller (SMC) to implement low-level torque control of the joint. The SMC controller is experimentally compared with a baseline feedback-linearised proportional-derivative controller across a range of conditions and shown to be robust to un-modeled disturbances. The torque controller is then tested with six healthy subjects while they perform a selection of activities of daily living, which has validated its range of performance. Finally, a case study with a participant with spastic cerebral palsy is presented to illustrate the potential of both the joint and controller to be used in a physiotherapy setting to assist clinical populations. ? 2001-2011 IEEE.",Control engineering; exoskeletons; rehabilitation robotics; series elastic actuator; sliding mode control,"Cables; Controllers; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Man machine systems; Robotics; Robots; Robust control; Sliding mode control; Torque control; Activities of Daily Living; Control engineering; Displacement characteristic; Dynamic system modeling; Proportional-derivative controllers; Rehabilitation robotics; Series elastic actuators; Sliding mode controller; Human robot interaction; adult; Article; biosensor; case report; cerebral palsy; clinical article; computer model; human; human computer interaction; human experiment; impedance; male; mathematical model; normal human; physiotherapy; robotic exoskeleton; robotics; torque; algorithm; biological model; computer simulation; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; exoskeleton (rehabilitation); feedback system; joint prosthesis; limb prosthesis; man machine interaction; neurorehabilitation; procedures; reproducibility; robotics; sensitivity and specificity; Young modulus; Algorithms; Artificial Limbs; Computer Simulation; Elastic Modulus; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Exoskeleton Device; Feedback; Humans; Joint Prosthesis; Man-Machine Systems; Models, Biological; Neurological Rehabilitation; Reproducibility of Results; Robotics; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-85019086700

Methods A systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane library was performed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. Studies including patients who underwent liver resection with and without PVE (N-PVE) were included. Results Thirteen studies including 1345 were included of which 539 patients had PVE and 806 had N-PVE. Eight studies reported that from a total of 450 patients who underwent PVE, 136 (30%) did not proceed to liver resection. In 114 (84%) patients this was due to disease progression. The postoperative morbidity was 42% (n = 151) after PVE and 10% (n = 35) developed postoperative liver failure after liver resection. Median overall survival, reported in all studies, was 38.9 months and 45.6 months respectively, following resection with PVE and N-PVE. The median disease free survival, reported in eight studies, was 15.7 (PVE) and 21.4 (N-PVE) months respectively. Conclusion Following PVE 70% of patients proceed to liver resection, with a 10% risk of postoperative liver failure.

As therapeutic hypothermia is only partially effective, adjunct therapies are needed to optimize outcomes. The aim was to assess whether hypothermia + dexmedetomidine treatment augments neuroprotection compared to routine treatment (hypothermia + fentanyl sedation) in a piglet model of NE using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) biomarkers, which predict outcomes in babies with NE, and immunohistochemistry. After hypoxia-ischaemia (HI), 20 large White male piglets were randomized to: (i) hypothermia + fentanyl with cooling to 33.5°C from 2 to 26 h, or (ii) hypothermia + dexmedetomidine (a loading dose of 2 μg/kg at 10 min followed by 0.028 μg/kg/h for 48 h). Whole-brain phosphorus-31 and regional proton MRS biomarkers were assessed at baseline, 24, and 48 h after HI. At 48 h, cell death was evaluated over 7 brain regions by means of transferase-mediated d-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Dexmedetomidine plasma levels were mainly within the target sedative range of 1 μg/L. In the hypothermia + dexmedetomidine group, there were 6 cardiac arrests (3 fatal) versus 2 (non-fatal) in the hypothermia + fentanyl group. The hypothermia + dexmedetomidine group required more saline (p = 0.005) to maintain blood pressure. Thalamic and white-matter lactate/N-acetylaspartate did not differ between groups (p = 0.66 and p = 0.21, respectively); the whole-brain nucleotide triphosphate/exchangeable phosphate pool was similar (p = 0.73) over 48 h. Cell death (TUNEL-positive cells/mm2) was higher in the hypothermia + dexmedetomidine group than in the hypothermia + fentanyl group (mean 5.1 vs. 2.3, difference 2.8 [95% CI 0.6-4.9], p = 0.036). Hypothermia + dexmedetomidine treatment was associated with adverse cardiovascular events, even within the recommended clinical sedative plasma level; these may have been exacerbated by an interaction with either isoflurane or low body temperature. Hypothermia + dexmedetomidine treatment was neurotoxic following HI in our piglet NE model, suggesting that caution is vital if dexmedetomidine is combined with cooling following NE. ? 2017 S.

However, limited data are available on ethnic/socio-economic differences in surgical treatment of breast cancer, or reasons for such variations within the local context. We investigated ethnic/socio-economic differences in rates of mastectomy, sentinel node biopsy (SNB), post-mastectomy breast reconstruction and definitive local therapy for breast cancer in New Zealand. Methods: A retrospective review of prospective data in the Waikato Breast Cancer Register for women diagnosed during 1999–2012 was performed. Differences in rates of mastectomy (for stage I/II, T1/T2 cancers), SNB (for stage I/II, T1/T2, cN0 cancers), post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (for non-metastatic cancers in women <70 years) and definitive local therapy (for stage I/II cancers) were analysed in univariate and multivariate regression models, adjusting for covariates. Results: Significantly lower mastectomy and higher reconstruction rates were associated with younger age, private compared with public hospital care and screen compared with non-screen detection. Compared with NZ Europeans, M?ori (41% versus 33%, P = 0.025) were significantly more likely to undergo mastectomy for cancers, which were potentially amenable for breast conserving surgery, but were significantly less likely to undergo post-mastectomy breast reconstruction (12% versus 35%, P < 0.001). No significant ethnic or socio-economic differences were observed in rates of SNB or definitive local therapy. Conclusions: This study has demonstrated lower rates of breast conserving surgery and reconstructions in M?ori compared with NZ European women, and highlight the need for future research to focus on understanding the reasons behind these findings. ? 2015 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons",breast cancer; breast conserving surgery; breast reconstruction; ethnicity; inequity; mastectomy,"adult; aged; breast reconstruction; breast tumor; Caucasian; comparative study; demography; ethnic group; female; human; mastectomy; middle aged; New Zealand; pathology; retrospective study; sentinel lymph node biopsy; socioeconomics; standards; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; Demography; Ethnic Groups; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Mammaplasty; Mastectomy; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Retrospective Studies; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy; Socioeconomic Factors",2-s2.0-84923584333

Despite this, there is a lack of high quality evidence supporting medication use after first line benzodiazepines, with current treatment protocols based solely on non-experimental evidence and expert opinion. The current standard of care, phenytoin, is only 60% effective, and associated with considerable adverse effects. A newer anti-convulsant, levetiracetam, can be given faster, is potentially more efficacious, with a more tolerable side effect profile. The primary aim of the study presented in this protocol is to determine whether intravenous (IV) levetiracetam or IV phenytoin is the better second line treatment for the emergency management of CSE in children. Methods/Design: 200 children aged between 3 months and 16 years presenting to 13 emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand with CSE, that has failed to stop with first line benzodiazepines, will be enrolled into this multicentre open randomised controlled trial. Participants will be randomised to 40 mg/kg IV levetiracetam infusion over 5 min or 20 mg/kg IV phenytoin infusion over 20 min. The primary outcome for the study is clinical cessation of seizure activity five minutes following the completion of the infusion of the study medication. Blinded confirmation of the primary outcome will occur with the primary outcome assessment being video recorded and assessed by a primary outcome assessment team blinded to treatment allocation. Secondary outcomes include: Clinical cessation of seizure activity at two hours; Time to clinical seizure cessation; Need for rapid sequence induction; Intensive care unit (ICU) admission; Serious adverse events; Length of Hospital/ICU stay; Health care costs; Seizure status/death at one-month post discharge. Discussion: This paper presents the background, rationale, and design for a randomised controlled trial comparing levetiracetam to phenytoin in children presenting with CSE in whom benzodiazepines have failed. This study will provide the first high quality evidence for management of paediatric CSE post first-line benzodiazepines.

Hysterectomy can be performed abdominally, laparoscopically, or vaginally, with or without laparoscopic assistance. Antibiotic prophylaxis consists of administration of antibiotics to reduce the rate of postoperative infection, which otherwise affects 40%-50% of women after vaginal hysterectomy, and more than 20% after abdominal hysterectomy. No Cochrane review has systematically assessed evidence on this topic. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and safety of antibiotic prophylaxis in women undergoing elective hysterectomy. Search methods: We searched electronic databases to November 2016 (including the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Studies (CRSO), MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), as well as clinical trials registers, conference abstracts, and reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria: All randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing use of antibiotics versus placebo or other antibiotics as prophylaxis in women undergoing elective hysterectomy. Data collection and analysis: We used Cochrane standard methodological procedures. Main results: We included in this review 37 RCTs, which performed 20 comparisons of various antibiotics versus placebo and versus one another (6079 women). The quality of the evidence ranged from very low to moderate. The main limitations of study findings were risk of bias due to poor reporting of methods, imprecision due to small samples and low event rates, and inadequate reporting of adverse effects. Any antibiotic versus placebo Vaginal hysterectomy Moderate-quality evidence shows that women who received antibiotic prophylaxis had fewer total postoperative infections (risk ratio (RR) 0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19 to 0.40; five RCTs, N = 610; I2 = 85%), less urinary tract infection (UTI) (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.43 to 0.77; eight RCTs, N = 1790; I2 = 44%), fewer pelvic infections (RR 0.28, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.39; 11 RCTs, N = 2010; I2 = 57%), and fewer postoperative fevers (RR 0.43, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.54; nine RCTs, N = 1879; I2 = 48%) than women who did not receive such prophylaxis. This suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the average risk of postoperative infection from about 34% to 7% to 14%. Whether this treatment has led to differences in rates of other serious infection remains unclear (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.01 to 4.10; one RCT, N = 146; very low-quality evidence). Data were insufficient for comparison of adverse effects. Abdominal hysterectomy Women who received antibiotic prophylaxis of any class had fewer total postoperative infections (RR 0.16, 95% CI 0.06 to 0.38; one RCT, N = 345; low-quality evidence), abdominal wound infections (RR 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.92; 11 RCTs, N = 2434; I2 = 0%; moderate-quality evidence), UTIs (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.51; 11 RCTs, N = 2547; I2 = 26%; moderate-quality evidence), pelvic infections (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.71; 11 RCTs, N = 1883; I2 = 11%; moderate-quality evidence), and postoperative fevers (RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.51 to 0.70; 11 RCTs, N = 2581; I2 = 51%; moderate-quality evidence) than women who did not receive prophylaxis, suggesting that antibiotic prophylaxis reduces the average risk of postoperative infection from about 16% to 1% to 6%. Whether this treatment has led to differences in rates of other serious infection remains unclear (RR 0.44, 95% CI 0.12 to 1.69; two RCTs, N = 476; I2 = 29%; very low-quality evidence). It is unclear whether rates of adverse effects differed between groups (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.62 to 5.18; two RCTs, N = 430; I2 = 0%; very low-quality evidence). Head-to-head comparisons between antibiotics Vaginal hysterectomy We identified four comparisons: cephalosporin versus penicillin (two RCTs, N = 470), cephalosporin versus tetracycline (one RCT, N = 51), antiprotozoal versus lincosamide (one RCT, N = 80), and cephalosporin versus antiprotozoal (one RCT, N = 78). Data show no evidence of differences between groups for any of the primary outcomes, except that fewer cases of total postoperative infection and postoperative fever were reported in women who received cephalosporin than in those who received antiprotozoal. Only one comparison (cephalosporin vs penicillin; two RCTs, N = 451) yielded data on adverse effects and showed no differences between groups. Abdominal hysterectomy We identified only one comparison: cephalosporin versus penicillin (N = 220). Data show no evidence of differences between groups for any of the primary outcomes. Adverse effects were not reported. Combined antibiotics versus single antibiotics Vaginal hysterectomy We identified three comparisons: cephalosporin plus antiprotozoal versus cephalosporin (one RCT, N = 78), cephalosporin plus antiprotozoal versus antiprotozoal (one RCT, N = 78), and penicillin plus antiprotozoal versus penicillin (one RCT, N = 230). Data were unavailable for most outcomes, including adverse effects. We found no evidence of differences between groups, except that fewer women receiving cephalosporin with antiprotozoal received a diagnosis of total postoperative infection, UTI, or postoperative fever compared with women receiving antiprotozoal. Abdominal hysterectomy We identified one comparison (penicillin plus antiprotozoal vs penicillin only; one RCT, N = 230). Whether differences between groups occurred was unclear. Adverse effects were not reported. Comparison of cephalosporins in different regimens Single small trials addressed dose comparisons and provided no data for most outcomes, including adverse effects. Whether differences between groups occurred was unclear. No trials compared route of administration. The quality of evidence for all head-to-head and dose comparisons was very low owing to very serious imprecision and serious risk of bias related to poor reporting of methods. Authors' conclusions: Antibiotic prophylaxis appears to be effective in preventing postoperative infection in women undergoing elective vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy, regardless of the dose regimen. However, evidence is insufficient to show whether use of prophylactic antibiotics influences rates of adverse effects. Similarly, evidence is insufficient to show which (if any) individual antibiotic, dose regimen, or route of administration is safest and most effective. The most recent studies included in this review were 14 years old at the time of our search.

Homocysteine (Hcy) is a sulfur-containing amino acid and metabolite of the methionine pathway. The interrelated methionine, purine, and thymidylate cycles constitute the one-carbon metabolism that plays a critical role in the synthesis of DNA, neurotransmitters, phospholipids, and myelin. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that one-carbon metabolites beyond Hcy are relevant to cognitive function and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of AD pathology in older adults. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis was performed on matched CSF and plasma collected from 120 older community-dwelling adults with (n = 72) or without (n = 48) cognitive impairment. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed to quantify one-carbon metabolites and their cofactors. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was initially applied to clinical and biomarker measures that generate the highest diagnostic accuracy of a priori-defined cognitive impairment (Clinical Dementia Rating-based) and AD pathology (i.e., CSF tau phosphorylated at threonine 181 [p-tau181]/β-Amyloid 1-42 peptide chain [Aβ1-42] &gt;0.0779) to establish a reference benchmark. Two other LASSO-determined models were generated that included the one-carbon metabolites in CSF and then plasma. Correlations of CSF and plasma one-carbon metabolites with CSF amyloid and tau were explored. LASSO-determined models were stratified by apolipoprotein E (APOE) ?4 carrier status. Results: The diagnostic accuracy of cognitive impairment for the reference model was 80.8% and included age, years of education, Aβ1-42, tau, and p-tau181. A model including CSF cystathionine, methionine, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), serine, cysteine, and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) improved the diagnostic accuracy to 87.4%. A second model derived from plasma included cystathionine, glycine, methionine, SAH, SAM, serine, cysteine, and Hcy and reached a diagnostic accuracy of 87.5%. CSF SAH and 5-MTHF were associated with CSF tau and p-tau181. Plasma one-carbon metabolites were able to diagnose subjects with a positive CSF profile of AD pathology in APOE ?4 carriers. Conclusions: We observed significant improvements in the prediction of cognitive impairment by adding one-carbon metabolites. This is partially explained by associations with CSF tau and p-tau181, suggesting a role for one-carbon metabolism in the aggregation of tau and neuronal injury. These metabolites may be particularly critical in APOE ?4 carriers. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Alzheimer's disease; Cognition; CSF; Homocysteine; Metabolomics; One-carbon metabolism; S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine; Tau,"5 methyltetrahydrofolic acid; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; apolipoprotein E; carbon; cystathionine; cysteine; drug metabolite; glycine; homocysteine; methionine; phosphoprotein; s adenosylhomocysteine; s adenosylmethionine; serine; tau protein; threonine; biological marker; carbon; homocysteine; inorganic compound; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; carbon metabolism; cerebrospinal fluid level; cognitive defect; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diagnostic accuracy; female; human; major clinical study; male; one carbon metabolism; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein aggregation; Alzheimer disease; blood; cerebrospinal fluid; cognitive defect; comorbidity; prevalence; risk factor; Switzerland; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Carbon; Carbon Compounds, Inorganic; Cognition Disorders; Comorbidity; Female; Homocysteine; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Switzerland",2-s2.0-85020892435

Supplemental protein intake is known to enhance gains in muscle mass through activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway, which initiates protein translation. While the optimal dose of high quality protein to promote post exercise anabolism in young or older men has been investigated, little is known about the minimum doses of protein required to potentiate the resistance exercise activation of anabolic signalling in middle aged men. Methods: Twenty healthy men (46.3 ± 5.7 years, BMI: 23.9 ± 6.6 kg/m2) completed a single bout of unilateral resistance exercise consisting of 4 sets of leg extension and press at 80% of 1 repetition maximum. Participants were randomised to consume either formulated milk product containing 9 g milk protein (FMP) or an isoenergetic carbohydrate placebo (CHO) immediately post exercise, in a double blind fashion. A single muscle biopsy was collected at pre-exercise baseline and then bilateral biopsies were collected 90 and 240 min after beverage consumption. Results: P70S6KThr389 phosphorylation was increased with exercise irrespective of group, P70S6KThr421/Ser424 was increased with exercise only in the FMP group at 240 min. Likewise, rpS6 Ser235/236 phosphorylation was increased with exercise irrespective of group, rpS6 Ser240/244 increased to a greater extent following exercise in the FMP group. mRNA expression of the amino acid transporter, LAT1/ SLC7A5 increased with both exercise and beverage consumption irrespective of group. PAT1/ SLC36A1, CAT1/ SLC7A1 and SNAT2/ SLC38A2 mRNA increased only after exercise regardless of group. Conclusions: Nine grams of milk protein is sufficient to augment some measures of downstream mTORC1 signalling after resistance exercise but does not potentiate exercise induced increases in amino acid transporter expression. Formulated products containing nine grams of milk protein would be expected stimulate muscle anabolism after resistance exercise.

Nonetheless, only three medical professional bodies (and none in nursing) across those jurisdictions have proactively developed authorised policy, practice standards, guidelines or protocols, or other professional supports for health practitioners who may legally participate in AD services, and the majority internationally remain formally opposed to AD. There is a perceived likelihood that AD may be legalised in New Zealand soon. AIM: This study explored the views of doctors and nurses as to support for or opposition to legalising AD, including reasons for those views, what might deter generally willing doctors and nurses from providing AD services and what professional supports were perceived as essential or desirable to enable willing engagement in AD service provision. RESULTS: While only 37% of doctors supported legalising AD in New Zealand, 67% of nurses were supportive. Of those respondents who were willing in principle to provide AD services, large majorities identified a range of practical and ethical professional supports as essential to safe practitioner engagement. Those respondents overwhelmingly saw the provision of most of those supports as the responsibility of the medical and nursing professional bodies. CONCLUSION: There is a substantial cohort of doctors and nurses in New Zealand who support legalising AD, potentially sufficient for reasonable seeker access to AD services once legalised. However, many doctors in particular still oppose AD, and international research shows that the main barrier to access to legal AD is a lack of capacity and capability among health professionals, due in large part to several related factors, in particular: a lack of either accredited training and education for the AD provider tasks and roles; inadequate immunities within the legislation to protect participating professionals; and most importantly, a lack of practice standards and guidelines authorised by the relevant medical and nursing professional bodies. The challenge is for such protections to be available well in advance of legalisation, so that health practitioners are not at risk ethically or otherwise in early participation. ?

AIM: To identify modifiable risk factors for SUDI. METHODS: A three-year (1 March 2012–28 February 2015) nationwide case-control study was conducted in New Zealand. RESULTS: There were 137 SUDI cases, giving a SUDI mortality rate of 0.76/1,000 live births. The rate for M?ori was 1.41/1,000, Pacific 1.01/1,000 and non-M?ori non-Pacific (predominantly European) 0.50/1,000. The parent(s) of 97% of the SUDI cases were interviewed. Six hundred and forty-nine controls were selected and 258 (40%) were interviewed. The two major risk factors for SUDI were: maternal smoking in pregnancy (adjusted OR=6.01, 95% CI=2.97, 12.15) and bed sharing (aOR=4.96, 95% CI=2.55, 9.64). There was a significant interaction (p=0.002) between bed sharing and antenatal maternal smoking. Infants exposed to both risk factors had a markedly increased risk of SUDI (aOR=32.8, 95% CI=11.2, 95.8) compared with infants not exposed to either risk factor. Infants not sharing the parental bedroom were also at increased risk of SUDI (aOR=2.77, 95% CI=1.45, 5.30). Just 21 cases over the three-year study were not exposed to smoking in pregnancy, bed sharing or front or side sleeping position. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown that many of the risk factors that were identified in the original New Zealand Cot Death Study (1987–1989) are still relevant today. The combination of maternal smoking in pregnancy and bed sharing is extremely hazardous for infants. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the SUDI prevention messages are still applicable today and should be reinforced. SUDI mortality could be reduced to just seven p.a. in New Zealand (approximately one in 10,000 live births). ?

Detailed studies over several years have demonstrated that phosphorothioate and 2'-Omethoxyethyl- modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeting the ISS-N1 site increase SMN2 exon 7 inclusion, thus increasing levels of SMN protein in a dose- and time-dependent manner in liver, kidney and skeletal muscle, and CNS tissues only when administered intrathecally. On a dose basis, nusinersen was found to be the most potent ASO for SMN2 splicing correction in the CNS of adult mice. After nusinersen was found to increase levels of SMN protein in the CNS of mice and subhuman primates without causing significant adverse events, it was advanced into clinical studies in patients with SMA. These trials in SMA patients have demonstrated significant improvements in various measures of motor function and in progression to movement developments not normally seen in SMA patients. In addition, there have been significant extensions in life expectancy. These findings led to the U.S. and European approval of nusinersen for use in SMA patients of all ages.

More than 80% of low-grade gliomas and secondary glioblastoma (GBM) harbor an IDH mutation. IDH mutations involve the catalytic pocket of the enzyme and lead to a neomorphic ability to produce 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG) while oxidizing NADPH to NADP+. 2HG is considered as an 'oncometabolite' which is thought to be responsible for many, if not all, biologic effects of IDH mutations. 2HG accumulation competitively inhibits α-KG-dependent dioxygenases, including histone lysine demethylases and DNA demethylases, resulting in a hypermethylation phenotype with alterations in cellular epigenetic status as well as a block in cellular differentiation. IDH mutations have been suggested as an important early event in tumorigenesis, however it remains unclear whether IDH mutation by itself causes cancer or if it requires other oncogenic events to initiate tumorigenesis. Significant efforts have been made to better understand the mechanisms of IDH mutations in tumor initiation and progression, and to develop targeted therapies for IDH-mutated tumors. This review provides an overview of the function of mutant IDH, and the current understanding of the role IDH mutations play in gliomagenesis. In addition, several potential therapeutic strategies for IDH-mutant gliomas, including mutant IDH inhibitors which have entered clinical evaluation in glioma patients, will be discussed. ?

Current targeted therapy regimes in melanoma largely target the proliferating cancer population, leaving slow-cycling cancer cells undamaged. Consequently, slow-cycling cells are enriched upon drug therapy and can remain in the body for years until acquiring proliferative potential that triggers cancer relapse. Here we overview the molecular mechanisms of slowcycling cells that underlie treatment resistance in melanoma. Three main areas of molecular reprogramming are discussed that mediate slow cycling and treatment resistance. First, a low microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) dedifferentiated state activates various signaling pathways. This includes WNT5A, EGFR, as well as other signaling activators, such as AXL and NF-kB. Second, the chromatin-remodeling factor Jumonji/ARID domain-containing protein 1B (JARID1B, KDM5B) orchestrates and maintains slow cycling and treatment resistance in a small subpopulation of melanoma cells. Finally, a shift in metabolic state toward oxidative phosphorylation has been demonstrated to regulate treatment resistance in slow-cycling cells. Elucidation of the underlying processes of slow cycling and its utilization by melanoma cells may reveal new vulnerable characteristics as therapeutic targets. Moreover, combining current therapies with targeting slow-cycling subpopulations of melanoma cells may allow for more durable and greater treatment responses. ?2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"AXL protein; epidermal growth factor receptor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; KDM5B protein; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; protein; retinoblastoma binding protein 2; unclassified drug; Wnt5a protein; antineoplastic agent; microphthalmia associated transcription factor; tumor marker; cancer resistance; cell cycle; cell dedifferentiation; cell survival; chromatin assembly and disassembly; human; melanoma; melanoma cell; metabolism; metastasis; molecular dynamics; nuclear reprogramming; oxidative phosphorylation; priority journal; Review; signal transduction; treatment response; animal; cell cycle; drug effects; drug resistance; energy metabolism; gene expression regulation; genetics; melanoma; molecularly targeted therapy; pathology; phenotype; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Cycle; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Melanoma; Microphthalmia-Associated Transcription Factor; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Neoplasm Metastasis; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Phenotype; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85020499575

We explored the predictors of mode of breastfeeding and its association with breastfeeding duration in a multi-ethnic Asian population. Methods: We included 541 breastfeeding mother—infant pairs from the Growing Up in Singapore Toward healthy Outcomes cohort. Mode of breastfeeding (feeding directly at the breast, expressed breast milk (EBM) feeding only, or mixed feeding (a combination of the former 2 modes)) was ascertained at three months postpartum. Ordinal logistic regression analyses identified predictors of breast milk expression. Cox regression models examined the association between mode of breastfeeding and duration of any and of full breastfeeding. Results: Maternal factors independently associated with a greater likelihood of breast milk expression instead of direct breastfeeding were Chinese (vs. Indian) ethnicity, (adjusted odds ratio, 95% CI; 3.41, 1.97–5.91), tertiary education (vs. secondary education or lower) (2.22, 1.22–4.04), primiparity (1.54, 1.04–2.26) and employment during pregnancy (2.53, 1.60–4.02). Relative to those who fed their infants directly at the breast, mothers who fed their infants EBM only had a higher likelihood of early weaning among all mothers who were breastfeeding (adjusted hazard ratio, 95% CI; 2.20, 1.61–3.02), and among those who were fully breastfeeding (2.39, 1.05–5.41). Mothers who practiced mixed feeding, however, were not at higher risk of earlier termination of any or of full breastfeeding. Conclusions: Mothers who fed their infants EBM exclusively, but not those who practiced mixed feeding, were at a higher risk of terminating breastfeeding earlier than those who fed their infants directly at the breast.

We sought to develop a score for use in primary care that estimates short-Term CVD risk in these patients. Methods Adults aged <80 years with prior CVD were identified from a New Zealand primary care cohort study (PREDICT), and linked to national mortality, hospitalisation and dispensing databases. A Cox model with an outcome of myocardial infarction, stroke or CVD death within 2 years was developed. External validation was performed in a cohort from the UK. Results 24 927 patients, 63% men, 63% European, median age 65 years (IQR 58-72 years), experienced 1480 CVD events within 2 years after a CVD risk assessment. A risk score including ethnicity, comorbidities, body mass index, creatine creatinine and treatment, in addition to established risk factors used in primary prevention, predicted a median 2-year CVD risk of 5.0% (IQR 3.5%-8.3%). A plot of actual against predicted event rates showed very good calibration throughout the risk range. The score performed well in the UK cohort but overestimated risk for those at highest risk, who were predominantly patients defined as having heart failure. Conclusions The PREDICT-CVD secondary prevention score uses routine measurements from clinical practice that enable it to be implemented in a primary care setting. The score will facilitate risk communication between primary care practitioners and patients with prior CVD, particularly as a resource to show the benefit of risk factor modification. ? ?

The aim of this study was to identify ultrasound features of the MTP1 joint in people with gout and people with asymptomatic hyperuricemia compared with normouricemic controls. Methods: Participants with gout (n = 23) and asymptomatic hyperuricemia (n = 29), and age- and sex-matched normouricemic control participants (n = 34), underwent a gray-scale and power Doppler ultrasound assessment of bilateral MTP1 joints by a single musculoskeletal radiologist. No participants had clinical evidence of joint inflammation at the time of scanning. The static images were later read by 2 musculoskeletal radiologists for the presence of the double contour sign, tophus, erosion, effusion, synovial hypertrophy, synovitis, and cartilage thickness. Results: Compared to normouricemic control participants, participants with gout and participants with asymptomatic hyperuricemia had more frequent double contour sign (odds ratio [OR] 3.91, P = 0.011 and OR 3.81, P = 0.009, respectively). Participants with gout also had more erosion (OR 10.13, P = 0.001) and synovitis (OR 9.00, P &lt; 0.001) and had greater tophus and erosion diameters (P = 0.035 and P &lt; 0.001, respectively). More severe erosion and synovitis grades and a less severe effusion grade were independently associated with gout compared with asymptomatic hyperuricemia (R2 = 0.65, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Urate deposition, synovitis, and bone erosion are common at the MTP1 joint in people with gout, even in the absence of flare.

Historically, authors have described the intrinsic muscles of the foot and/or the plantar fascia as attaching to the PCS. In this article we review the relationship between the PCS and surrounding soft tissues as well as examining the histology of the PCS. We identify a number of key associations with PCS, including age, weight, gender, arthritides, plantar fasciitis and foot position; these factors may function as risk factors in PCS formation. The etiology of these spurs is a contentious issue and it has been explained through a number of theories including the degenerative, inflammatory, traction, repetitive trauma, bone-formers and vertical compression theories.

Most research has, however, studied compassion fatigue rather than compassion itself and has concentrated on the role of the physician. The Transactional Model of Physician Compassion suggests that physician, patient, external environment, and clinical factors are all relevant. Because these factors vary both across different specialities and among physicians with differing degrees of experience, barriers to compassion are also likely to vary. Objectives We describe barriers to physician compassion as a function of specialization (psychiatry, general practice, surgery, internal medicine, and pediatrics) and physician experience. Methods We used a cross-sectional study using demographic data, specialization, practice parameters, and the Barriers to Physician Compassion Questionnaire. Nonrandom convenience sampling was used to recruit 580 doctors, of whom 444 belonged to the targeted speciality groups. The sample was characterized before conducting a factorial Multivariate Analysis of Covariance and further post hoc analyses. Results A 5 (speciality grouping) × 2 (more vs. less physician experience) Multivariate Analysis of Covariance showed that the barriers varied as a function of both speciality and experience. In general, psychiatrists reported lower barriers, whereas general practitioners and internal medicine specialists generally reported greater barriers. Barriers were generally greater among less experienced doctors. Conclusion Documenting and investigating barriers to compassion in different speciality groups have the potential to broaden current foci beyond the physician and inform interventions aimed at enhancing medical compassion. In addition, certain aspects of the training or practice of psychiatry that enhance compassion may mitigate barriers to compassion in other specialities. ? 2017 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine",Compassion; compassion fatigue; empathy; medical speciality,compassion fatigue; convenience sample; cross-sectional study; demography; empathy; general practitioner; human; human experiment; internal medicine; multivariate analysis of covariance; pediatrics; post hoc analysis; psychiatrist; psychiatry; questionnaire; specialization; surgery; clinical competence; female; general practice; general surgery; health personnel attitude; internal medicine; job stress; male; multivariate analysis; pediatrics; physician; psychiatry; psychology; specialization; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Empathy; Female; General Practice; General Surgery; Humans; Internal Medicine; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Occupational Stress; Pediatrics; Physicians; Psychiatry; Specialization; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85011798266

Key findings include the reporting of 28 urate-associated loci, the discovery that ABCG2 plays a central role on extra-renal uric acid excretion, the identification of genes associated with development of gout in the context of hyperuricaemia, recognition that ABCG2 variants influence allopurinol response, and the impact of HLA-B*5801 testing in reducing the prevalence of allopurinol hypersensitivity in high-risk populations. These advances, together with the reducing cost of whole genome sequencing, mean that integrated personalised medicine approaches may soon be possible in clinical practice. Genetic data may inform assessment of disease prognosis in individuals with hyperuricaemia or established gout, personalised lifestyle advice, selection and dosing of urate-lowering therapy, and prevention of serious medication adverse effects.

These early responders tend to be over represented among those who are well at termination and at follow-up. Early response patterns in psychotherapy have been investigated only for a few of mental disorders so far. The main aim of the current study was to examine early response after five therapy-preparing sessions of a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for syndromes of medically unexplained symptoms (MUS). Methods: In the context of a randomized, waiting-list controlled trial 48 patients who suffered from ?3 MUS over ?6 months received 5 therapy-preparing sessions and 20 sessions of CBT for somatoform disorders. They completed self-report scales of somatic symptom severity (SOMS-7 T), depression (BDI-II), anxiety (BSI), illness anxiety and behavior (IAS) at pre-treatment, after 5 therapy-preparing sessions (FU-5P) and at therapy termination (FU-20 T). Results: The current analyses are based on data from the treatment arm only. Repeated measure ANOVAs revealed a significant decrease of depression (d = 0.34), anxiety (d = 0.60), illness anxiety (d = 0.38) and illness behavior (d = 0.42), but no change of somatic symptom severity (d = -0.03) between pre-treatment and FU-5P. Hierarchical linear multiple regression analyses showed that symptom improvements between pre-treatment and FU-5P predict a better outcome at therapy termination for depression and illness anxiety, after controlling for pre-treatment scores. Mixed-effect ANOVAs revealed significant group*time interaction effects indicating differences in the course of symptom improvement over the therapy between patients who fulfilled a reliable change (i.e., early response) during the 5 therapy-preparing sessions and patients who did not reach an early reliable change. Demographic or clinical variables at pre-treatment were not significantly correlated with differential scores between pre-treatment and FU-5P (-.23 ? r ? .23). Conclusions: Due to several limitations (e.g., small sample size, lack of a control group) the results of this study have to be interpreted cautiously. Our findings show that reliable changes in regard to affective-cognitive and behavioral variables can take place very early in CBT of patients with distressing MUS. These early changes seem to be predictive of the outcome at therapy termination. Future studies are needed in order to replicate our results, and to identify mechanisms of these early response patterns in somatoform patients. Trial registration: ISRCTN. ISRCTN17188363.

It is widely accepted that the pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes is influenced by environmental factors in people with specific human leukocyte antigen haplotypes. We propose that a complex interplay between dietary triggers, permissive gut factors and potentially other influencing factors underpins disease progression. We present evidence that A1 β-casein cows' milk protein is a primary causal trigger of type 1 diabetes in individuals with genetic risk factors. Permissive gut factors (for example, aberrant mucosal immunity), intervene by impacting the gut's environment and the mucosal barrier. Various influencing factors (for example, breastfeeding duration, exposure to other dietary triggers and vitamin D) modify the impact of triggers and permissive gut factors on disease. The power of the dominant trigger and permissive gut factors on disease is influenced by timing, magnitude and/or duration of exposure. Within this framework, removal of a dominant dietary trigger may profoundly affect type 1 diabetes incidence. We present epidemiological, animal-based, in vitro and theoretical evidence for A1 β-casein and its β-casomorphin-7 derivative as dominant causal triggers of type 1 diabetes. The effects of ordinary milk containing A1 and A2 β-casein and milk containing only the A2 β-casein warrant comparison in prospective trials. ?

This study aimed to determine the effect of New Zealand’s six-hour time target (95% of ED patients discharged or admitted to hospital within six hours) on a range of quality indicators. METHODS: A nationwide observational study from 2006 to 2012 modelled differences in changes over time before and after target introduction in 2009. The observed model estimates in 2012 were compared to those predicted if pre-target trends had continued. Differences are absolute values except for morality, which is presented as a relative change. RESULTS: There were 5,793,767 ED presentations and 2,082,374 elective admissions from 18 out of a possible 20 district health boards included in the study. There were clinically important reductions in hospital LOS (-0.29 days), EDLOS (-1.1 hours), admitted patients EDLOS (-2.9 hours), ED crowding (-26.8%), ED mortality (-57.8%), elective inpatient mortality (-42.2%) and the proportion not waiting for assessment (-2.8%). Small changes were seen in time to assessment in the ED (-3.4 minutes), re-presentation to ED within 48 hours of the index ED discharge (-0.7%), re-presentation to ED within 48 hours from ward discharge (+0.4%) and acute admissions (+3.9%). An increase was observed in re-admission to a ward within 30 days of discharge (1.0%). These changes were all statistically significant (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Most outcomes we investigated either improved or were unchanged after the introduction of the time target policy in New Zealand. However, attention is required to ensure that reductions in hospital length of stay are not at the expense of subsequent re-admissions. ?

Achilles tendons of eight participants (Aged 25–35?years) were scanned with freehand 3D ultrasound at rest and during a 70% maximum voluntary isometric contraction. Ultrasound images were segmented, volume rendered and transformed into subject-specific 3D finite element meshes. The mean (±SD) lengths, volumes and cross-sectional areas of the tendons at rest were 62?±?13?mm, 3617?±?984?mm3 and 58?±?11?mm2 respectively. The measured tendon strain at 70% MVIC was 5.9?±?1.3%. Subject-specific material properties were obtained using an optimisation approach that minimised the difference between measured and modelled longitudinal free tendon strain. Generic geometry was represented by the average mesh and generic material properties were taken from the literature. Local stresses were subsequently computed for combinations of subject-specific and generic geometry and material properties. For a given geometry, changing from generic to subject-specific material properties had little effect on the stress distribution in the tendon. In contrast, changing from generic to subject-specific geometry had a 26-fold greater effect on tendon stress distribution. Overall, these findings indicate that the stress distribution experienced by the living free Achilles tendon of a young and healthy population during voluntary loading are more sensitive to variation in tendon geometry than variation in tendon material properties. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Achilles tendon; Finite element modelling; Material properties; Morphology; Strain; Stress; Subject specificity,"Finite element method; Geometry; Materials properties; Morphology; Strain; Stress analysis; Stress concentration; Stresses; Ultrasonics; Achilles tendons; Cross sectional area; Finite element modelling; Freehand 3D ultrasound; Isometric contractions; Subject specific geometry; Subject specificity; Threedimensional (3-d); Tendons; achilles tendon; adult; Article; controlled study; female; finite element analysis; geometry; human; human experiment; in vivo study; isometric exercise; male; muscle isometric contraction; normal human; rest; tendon stress; voluntary movement; achilles tendon; diagnostic imaging; echography; mechanical stress; physiology; Achilles Tendon; Adult; Female; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Isometric Contraction; Male; Stress, Mechanical; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-85016220737

Among 99 murine S. aureus isolates from Charles River Laboratories half belonged to the lineage CC88 (54.5%), followed by CC15, CC5, CC188, and CC8. A comparison of human and murine S. aureus isolates revealed features of host adaptation. In detail, murine strains lacked hlb-converting phages and superantigen-encoding mobile genetic elements, and were frequently ampicillin-sensitive. Moreover, murine CC88 isolates coagulated mouse plasma faster than human CC88 isolates. Importantly, S. aureus colonization clearly primed the murine immune system, inducing a systemic IgG response specific for numerous S. aureus proteins, including several vaccine candidates. Phospholipase C emerged as a promising test antigen for monitoring S. aureus colonization in laboratory mice. In conclusion, laboratory mice are natural hosts of S. aureus and therefore, could provide better infection models than previously assumed. Pre-exposure to the bacteria is a possible confounder in S. aureus infection and vaccination studies and should be monitored. ? 2017 Schulz, Grumann, Tr?be, Pritchett-Corning, Johnson, Reppschl?ger, Gumz, Sundaramoorthy, Michalik, Berg, van den Brandt, Fister, Monecke, Uy, Schmidt, Br?ker, Wiles and Holtfreter.",Antibody; CC88; Colonization; Genotype; Host adaptation; Laboratory mice; Staphylococcus aureus,"bacterial antigen; bacterial protein; bacterium antibody; immunoglobulin G; phospholipase C; staphylococcus protein A; virulence factor; animal; antibiotic resistance; bacteriophage; blood; C57BL mouse; disease model; enzymology; genetics; genotype; growth, development and aging; human; immune evasion; immunology; interspersed repeat; male; microbiology; mouse; multigene family; pathogenicity; penicillin resistance; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; transmission; vaccination; virulence; Ampicillin Resistance; Animals; Antibodies, Bacterial; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Bacteriophages; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Genotype; Humans; Immune Evasion; Immunoglobulin G; Interspersed Repetitive Sequences; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Multigene Family; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcal Protein A; Staphylococcus aureus; Type C Phospholipases; Vaccination; Virulence; Virulence Factors",2-s2.0-85027501116

Amylin and CGRP share a receptor and are reported to have several similar biological actions. Given the important role of CGRP in migraine and intense efforts to develop drugs against this target, it is important to consider potential areas of overlap between the amylin and CGRP systems. This short review provides a brief introduction to amylin biology, the use of an amylin analog to treat diabetes, and consideration of whether amylin could have any role in headache disorders. Finally, this review informs readers about the AMY1 (amylin subtype 1) receptor, which is a dual receptor for amylin and CGRP and potentially plays a role in the bioactivity of both of these peptides. ? 2017 American Headache Society",amylin; CGRP; migraine; receptor activity-modifying protein,"amylin; amylin receptor; calcitonin gene related peptide; calcitonin gene related peptide receptor; amylin; amylin receptor; Article; headache; human; pain; priority journal; satiety; animal; metabolism; Animals; Humans; Islet Amyloid Polypeptide; Receptors, Islet Amyloid Polypeptide",2-s2.0-85019129173

Blink rate may be influenced by corneal sub-basal nerve density, however, this relationship has not yet been investigated in Parkinson's disease. This case-control study examined the ocular surface in patients with moderately severe Parkinson's disease, including confocal microscopy of the cornea. Fifteen patients with moderately severe Parkinson's disease (modified Hoehn and Yahr grade 3 or 4) and fifteen control participants were recruited. Ophthalmic assessment included slit-lamp examination, blink rate assessment, central corneal aesthesiometry and in vivo corneal confocal microscopy. The effect of disease laterality was also investigated. Of the 15 patients with Parkinson's disease, ten were male and the mean age was 65.5?±?8.6?years. The corneal sub-basal nerve plexus density was markedly reduced in patients with Parkinson's disease (7.56?±?2.4?mm/mm2) compared with controls (15.91?±?2.6?mm/mm2) (p?&lt;?0.0001). Corneal sensitivity did not differ significantly between the patients with Parkinson's disease (0.79?±?1.2?mBAR) and the control group (0.26?±?0.35?mBAR), p?=?0.12. Sub-basal nerve density was not significantly different between the eye ipsilateral to the side of the body with most-severe motor symptoms, and the contralateral eye. There was a significant positive correlation between ACE-R scores and sub-basal corneal nerve density (R2?=?0.66, p?=?0.02). This is the first study to report a significant reduction in corneal sub-basal nerve density in Parkinson's disease and demonstrate an association with cognitive dysfunction. These results provide further evidence to support the involvement of the peripheral nervous system in Parkinson's disease, previously thought to be a central nervous system disorder. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Corneal sub-basal nerves; In vivo confocal microscopy; Parkinson's disease; Peripheral neuropathy,"ACE-R score; adult; aged; Article; central corneal aesthesiometry; clinical article; clinical assessment tool; cognitive defect; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cornea; corneal sensitivity; corneal sub-basal nerve plexus; disease association; disease severity; eyelid reflex; female; hospital based case control study; human; in vivo study; male; motor dysfunction; nerve plexus; nervous system parameters; Parkinson disease; scoring system; slit lamp microscopy; sub-basal corneal nerve density; symptom; visual system examination; visual system parameters; case control study; cornea; innervation; middle aged; Parkinson disease; pathology; pathophysiology; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Cornea; Female; Humans; Male; Microscopy, Confocal; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease",2-s2.0-85014165685

Currently, there are little data on doctors' perceptions of biosimilars and in what situations they are comfortable prescribing biosimilars. In this study, we investigated medical specialists' perceptions of biosimilars and the factors associated with the acceptance of biosimilars. Methods: A national sample of 110 of 327 medical specialists working in the areas of rheumatology, dermatology, gastroenterology, oncology and haematology completed an online questionnaire examining attitudes towards prescribing biosimilars, indication extrapolation and switching patients to a biosimilar. Results: Most specialists held positive views of biosimilars, with between 54 and 74% confident in the safety, efficacy, manufacturing and pharmacovigilance of biosimilars. Seventy-one percent of specialists agreed that they would prescribe biosimilars for all or some conditions meeting relevant clinical criteria. Specialists were less confident about indication extrapolation and switching patients from an existing biologic. Acceptance of biosimilars was significantly associated with a lower perceived time to explain a biosimilar to a patient and lower number of weekly patient appointments. The most common situations that they would not prescribe a biosimilar was where there was a lack of clinical data supporting efficacy (32%), or evidence of adverse effects (17%). Conclusions: Medical specialists held generally positive attitudes towards biosimilars but were less confident in indication extrapolation and switching patients from a biologic. Providing clinicians with guidance on how to explain biosimilars to patients and written patient material may help overcome some of the barriers to the use of biosimilars.

NMC is characterized by chromosomal rearrangements of the gene NUT, at 15q14. The BRD4 gene on 19q13 is the most common translocation partner forming a fusion oncogene, BRD4–NUT. By the end of 2014, the International NUT Midline Carcinoma Registry had 48 patients treated for NMC. Laryngeal NMC are exceedingly rare, and we report a case series of seven cases. Methods and results: We searched for cases in files of different hospitals as well as a thorough search of the English language literature. The diagnosis of NMC is made by demonstration of NUT rearrangement either by immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) or reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR). We found three previously published cases, and in this series add four cases of our own. Conclusions: NMC consists of monomorphic, often discohesive, cells with an epithelioid appearance and distinct nucleoli. The tumours typically show abrupt squamous differentiation. The mean age of the patients was 34 years, hence significantly lower than that for conventional laryngeal carcinoma. All tumours were located in the supraglottis and five patients died of the disease after 3, 7, 8, 9 and 11 months. Laryngeal NMC may be underdiagnosed, and an increased awareness among pathologists is warranted. NMC has characteristic morphological features, and positive immunostaining with the NUT antibody is diagnostic. Its aggressive behaviour demands a very intense treatment strategy and the need for its recognition is emphasized further by new promising treatment strategies. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",BRD4; larynx; NUT; NUT midline carcinoma; t(15;19); undifferentiated carcinoma,"adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer localization; case study; child; clinical article; controlled study; epiglottis; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene rearrangement; glottis; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; larynx carcinoma; male; middle aged; mortality; NUT midline carcinoma; preschool child; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; school child; squamous cell carcinoma; tissue section; tongue; tumor differentiation; undifferentiated carcinoma; young adult; carcinoma; genetics; Laryngeal Neoplasms; pathology; nuclear protein; NUT protein, human; oncoprotein; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Nuclear Proteins; Oncogene Proteins",2-s2.0-85013411103

Identifying the neural substrates of translational measures of attentional dysfunction would prove invaluable for developing therapeutics. Attentional performance is typically assessed via continuous performance tasks (CPTs), though many place additional cognitive demands with little cross-species test-relevance. Herein, event-related potentials (ERPs) were used to investigate the neurophysiological correlates of attention and response inhibition of SZ and healthy participants, whereas they performed the cross-species-translated five-choice CPT (5C-CPT). Chronically ill, medicated SZ patients and matched controls (n=25 SZ and 26 controls) were tested in the 5C-CPT, in conjunction with ERP and source localization assessments. The ERPs generated in response to correctly identified target and non-target trials revealed three peaks for analysis, corresponding to sensory registration (P 1), response selection (N 2), and response action (P 3). Behavioral responses revealed that SZ patients exhibited impaired attention driven by impaired and slower target detection, and poorer cognitive control. ERPs revealed decreased N 2 amplitudes reflecting poorer response selection for both target and non-target trials, plus reduced non-target P 3 s in SZ patients, the latter accounting for 37% of variance in negative symptoms. Source analyses revealed that the brain regions of significant differences localized to the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during response selection and the posterior cingulate cortex for cognitive processes. SZ patients exhibited impaired attention and cognitive control, characterized by less robust frontal and parietal ERP distributions across the response selection and cognitive response time windows, providing neurophysiological characterization of attentional dysfunction in SZ using the reverse-translated 5C-CPT. ? 2017 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.",,action potential amplitude; adult; Article; attention; attention disturbance; behavior; chronic patient; clinical article; continuous performance test; controlled study; correlation analysis; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; electrophysiological procedures; event related potential; executive function; female; human; left hemisphere; male; mental patient; neurophysiology; posterior cingulate; priority journal; response time; schizophrenia; task performance; cingulate gyrus; electroencephalography; evoked response; inhibition (psychology); middle aged; parietal lobe; pathophysiology; physiology; prefrontal cortex; psychomotor performance; schizophrenia; young adult; Adult; Attention; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials; Executive Function; Female; Gyrus Cinguli; Humans; Inhibition (Psychology); Male; Middle Aged; Parietal Lobe; Prefrontal Cortex; Psychomotor Performance; Schizophrenia; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85011799051

In 2002 the Australian Government mandated that 25% of commencing Australian medical students be of rural origin. Meeting this target has largely been achieved through reduced standards of entry for rural relative to urban applicants. This initiative is based on the assumption that rural origin students will succeed during training, and return to practice in rural locations. One aim of this study was to determine the relationships between student geographical origin (rural or urban), selection scores, and future practice intentions of medical students at course entry and course exit. Two multicentre databases containing selection and future practice preferences (location and specialisation) were combined (5862), representing 54% of undergraduate medical students commencing from 2006 to 2013 across nine Australian medical schools. A second aim was to determine course performance of rural origin students selected on lower scores than their urban peers. Selection and course performance data for rural (461) and urban (1431) origin students commencing 2006–2014 from one medical school was used. For Aim 1, a third (33.7%) of rural origin students indicated a preference for future rural practice at course exit, and even fewer (6.7%) urban origin students made this preference. Results from logistic regression analyses showed significant independent predictors were rural origin (OR 4.0), lower Australian Tertiary Admissions Rank (ATAR) (OR 2.1), or lower Undergraduate Medical and Health Sciences Admissions Test Section?3 (non-verbal reasoning) (OR 1.3). Less than a fifth (17.6%) of rural origin students indicated a preference for future generalist practice at course exit. Significant predictors were female gender (OR 1.7) or lower ATAR (OR 1.2), but not rural origin. Fewer (10.5%) urban origin students indicated a preference for generalist practice at course exit. For Aim 2, results of Mann–Whitney U tests confirmed that slightly reducing selection scores does not result in increased failure, or meaningfully impaired performance during training relative to urban origin students. Our multicentre analysis supports success of the rural origin WP pathway to increase rural student participation in medical training. However, our findings confirm that current selection initiatives are insufficient to address the continuing problem of doctor maldistribution in Australia. We argue for further reform to current medical student selection, which remains largely determined by academic meritocracy. Our findings have relevance to the selection of students into health professions globally. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Healthcare; Medical education; Medical student; Rural health; Selection; Sustainable healthcare; Widening access,"Australia; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; data base; female; gender; health care need; health science; human; logistic regression analysis; male; medical school; medical student; multicenter study; occupation; rural population; adolescent; age; Australia; decision making; education; manpower; medical school; rural health care; rural population; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adolescent; Age Factors; Australia; Career Choice; Educational Measurement; Female; Humans; Male; Rural Health Services; Rural Population; School Admission Criteria; Schools, Medical; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84994137583

Background: A minimum hourly urine output of 0.5 mL/kg is a key target guiding perioperative fluid therapy. Few data support this standard practice, which may contribute to perioperative fluid overloading. Methods: We randomized patients without significant risk factors for acute kidney injury undergoing elective colectomy to a minimum urine output target of 0.2 mL/kg/h (low group) or 0.5 mL/kg/h (standard group) from induction of anesthesia until 8 am 2 days after surgery. Maintenance fluids were standardized and additional fluids administered to achieve the targets. Primary outcome was noninferiority for urine neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin on the day after surgery. Results: Between November 21, 2011 and July 11, 2013, 40 participants completed the study. The low group received 3170 mL (95% confidence interval 2380-3960) intravenous fluids versus 5490 mL (95% confidence interval 4570-6410) in the standard group (P = 0.0004), and was noninferior for neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin [14.7 μg/L (interquartile range 7.60-28.9) vs 18.4 μg/L (interquartile range 8.30-21.2); Pnoninferiority = 0.0011], serum cystatin C (Pnoninferiority &lt; 0.0001), serum creatinine (Pnoninferiority = 0.0004), and measured glomerular filtration (Pnoninferiority = 0.0003). Effective renal plasma flow increased in both groups after surgery, and more in the standard group (Pnoninferiority = 0.125). Conclusions: A perioperative urine output target of 0.2 mL/kg/h is noninferior to the standard target of 0.5 mL/kg/h and results in a large intravenous fluid sparing. This target should be adopted in surgical patients without significant kidney injury risk factors. ? Copyright 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In waves two to six of the Baby (B) Cohort and one to six of the Kindergarten (K) Cohort of the population-based Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, parents or children reported biennially on the study child's consumption of twelve to sixteen healthy and less healthy food or drink items for the previous 24 h. For each wave, we derived a dietary score from 0 to 14, based on the 2013 Australian Dietary Guidelines (higher scores indicating healthier diet). We then used factor analyses to empirically derive dietary patterns for separate waves. Using group-based trajectory modelling, we generated trajectories of dietary scores and empirical patterns in 4504 B and 4640 K Cohort children. Four similar trajectories of dietary scores emerged for the B and K Cohorts, containing comparable proportions of children in each cohort: 'never healthy' (8·8 and 11·9 %, respectively), 'moderately healthy' (24·0 and 20·7 %), 'becoming less healthy' (16·6 and 27·3 %) and 'always healthy' (50·7 and 40·2 %). Deriving trajectories based on dietary patterns, rather than dietary scores, produced similar findings. For 'becoming less healthy' trajectories, dietary quality appeared to worsen from 7 years of age in both cohorts. In conclusion, a brief dietary measure administered repeatedly across childhood generated robust, nuanced dietary trajectories that were replicable across two cohorts and two methodologies. These trajectories appear ideal for future research into dietary determinants and health outcomes. Copyright ?

The resulting lack of knowledge has led to inconsistent guidelines, mainly based on systolic blood pressure (SBP), cardiovascular disease (CVD) but not on frailty despite the high prevalence in oldest-old. This may lead to variation how General Practitioners (GPs) treat hypertension. Our aim was to investigate treatment variation of GPs in oldest-olds across countries and to identify the role of frailty in that decision. Methods: Using a survey, we compared treatment decisions in cases of oldest-old varying in SBP, CVD, and frailty. GPs were asked if they would start antihypertensive treatment in each case. In 2016, we invited GPs in Europe, Brazil, Israel, and New Zealand. We compared the percentage of cases that would be treated per countries. A logistic mixed-effects model was used to derive odds ratio (OR) for frailty with 95% confidence intervals (CI), adjusted for SBP, CVD, and GP characteristics (sex, location and prevalence of oldest-old per GP office, and years of experience). The mixed-effects model was used to account for the multiple assessments per GP. Results: The 29 countries yielded 2543 participating GPs: 52% were female, 51% located in a city, 71% reported a high prevalence of oldest-old in their offices, 38% and had >20 years of experience. Across countries, considerable variation was found in the decision to start antihypertensive treatment in the oldest-old ranging from 34 to 88%. In 24/29 (83%) countries, frailty was associated with GPs’ decision not to start treatment even after adjustment for SBP, CVD, and GP characteristics (OR 0.53, 95%CI 0.48-0.59; ORs per country 0.11-1.78). Conclusions: Across countries, we found considerable variation in starting antihypertensive medication in oldest-old. The frail oldest-old had an odds ratio of 0.53 of receiving antihypertensive treatment. Future hypertension trials should also include frail patients to acquire evidence on the efficacy of antihypertensive treatment in oldest-old patients with frailty, with the aim to get evidence-based data for clinical decision-making. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Clinical variation; Elderly; Frailty; General practitioners; Hypertension; Oldest-old,"antihypertensive agent; aged; blood pressure; clinical competence; clinical decision making; clinical trial; drug effects; female; general practitioner; global health; human; hypertension; male; multicenter study; odds ratio; prevalence; questionnaire; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antihypertensive Agents; Blood Pressure; Clinical Competence; Clinical Decision-Making; Female; General Practitioners; Global Health; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85018500043

Its consumption is however linked with various types of diseases. This review focuses on the relationship of red meat with cancer, its dependency on the thermal processing methodology and the subsequent physiological effects. The epidemiological evidence is discussed, followed by introduction of the species that were hypothesized to contribute to these carcinogenic effects including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), heterocyclic amines (HCAs), N-nitroso compounds (NOCs), heme iron, and macromolecular oxidation products. Their carcinogenic mechanisms were then addressed with further emphasis on the involvement of inflammation and oxidative stress. The thermal processing dependency of the carcinogen generation and the partially elucidated carcinogenic mechanism both represent doorways of opportunities available for the scientific manipulation of their impact after human consumption, to minimize the cancer risks associated with red meat. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",carcinogenic; heme iron; heterocyclic amines; inflammation; N-nitroso compounds; oxidation products; oxidative stress; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,Amines; Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Diseases; Heat treatment; Hydrocarbons; Iron compounds; Meats; Nitrogen compounds; Organic compounds; Oxidative stress; Pathology; Physiology; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Porphyrins; carcinogenic; Heme iron; Heterocyclic amines; inflammation; N-nitroso compounds; Oxidation products; Thermal processing (foods); amine; carcinogen; nitroso derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; adverse effects; analysis; animal; chemically induced; cooking; drug effects; heat; human; inflammation; meta analysis (topic); Neoplasms; oxidative stress; randomized controlled trial (topic); red meat; risk factor; Amines; Animals; Carcinogens; Cooking; Hot Temperature; Humans; Inflammation; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Neoplasms; Nitroso Compounds; Oxidative Stress; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Red Meat; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85012155399

METHODS: The National Stroke Network introduced a central register of all ischaemic stroke patients treated with intravenous alteplase on January 1, 2015. The aim was to increase thrombolysis treatment rates and drive improvements in safety. RESULTS: From January 1, 2015 to June 30, 2016, alteplase was given to 623 patients [344 men, mean (range) age 70 (22–98) years] out of a total of 8,857 ischaemic and unspecified stroke patients, giving a thrombolysis rate of 7.0%. Between the first and second halves of the audit, there were more patients thrombolysed [350 of 4,456 (7.9%) versus 273 of 4,401 (6.8%); p=0.001] and more treated within 60 minutes of hospital arrival [137 of 325 (42%) versus 71 of 250 (28%), p=0.001]. Door-to-needle time reduced from 77 minutes to 64 minutes (p=0.002) and the onset-to-treatment reduced from 162 minutes to 140 minutes (p=0.070). Rates of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (4.3% patients) and survival at day seven (93%) were stable. CONCLUSIONS: There have been improvements in stroke thrombolysis rates and treatment delays in New Zealand hospitals since the institution of the National Stroke Network thrombolysis register. The Network will continue to adjust key performance indicators, and stroke thrombolysis targets for individual DHBs have been increased to 8% for 2017 and 10% for 2018. ?

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be used to assess inhibitory networks in the primary motor cortex via measures of 1-ms short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), long-interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), and late cortical disinhibition (LCD). These measures are thought to reflect extrasynaptic GABAA tonic inhibition, postsynaptic GABAB inhibition, and presynaptic GABAB disinhibition, respectively. The behavior of 1-ms SICI, LICI, and LCD during MI has not yet been explored. This study aimed to investigate how 1-ms SICI, LICI, and LCD are modulated during MI and voluntary relaxation (VR) of a target muscle. Twenty-five healthy young adults participated. TMS was used to assess nonconditioned motor evoked potential (MEP) amplitude, 1-ms SICI, 100-(LICI100) and 150-ms LICI, and LCD in the right abductor pollicis brevis (APB) and right abductor digiti minimi during rest, MI, and VR of the hand. Compared with rest, MEP amplitudes were facilitated in APB during MI. SICI was not affected by task or muscle. LICI100 decreased in both muscles during VR but not MI, whereas LCD was recruited in both muscles during both tasks. This indicates that VR modulates postsynaptic GABAB inhibition, whereas both tasks modulate presynaptic GABAB inhibition in a non-muscle-specific way. This study highlights further neurophysiological parallels between actual and imagined movement, which may extend to voluntary relaxation. ? 2017 the American Physiological Society.",Inhibition; Motor cortex; Motor imagery; Relaxation; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,"adult; Article; comparative study; controlled study; electromyography; female; hemispheric dominance; human; imagery; male; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; neuromodulation; normal human; primary motor cortex; priority journal; right handedness; transcranial magnetic stimulation; adolescent; analysis of variance; imagination; motor cortex; movement (physiology); nerve cell inhibition; physiology; skeletal muscle; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Electromyography; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Humans; Imagination; Male; Motor Cortex; Movement; Muscle, Skeletal; Neural Inhibition; Time Factors; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85017311293

Understanding how certain personality traits impact tinnitus perception and distress can be beneficial for the development of interventions to improve the lives of tinnitus sufferers. Purpose: Four key self-reported personality traits (social closeness, stress reaction, alienation, and selfcontrol) were identified from previous research as being associated with tinnitus. These were compared between tinnitus and age-, gender-, and hearing level-matched nontinnitus controls to see whether underlying profile differences exist, and if personality traits levels correlate with various tinnitus characteristics assessed in typical clinical questionnaires. Research Design: A Web-based personality survey was administered comprising of self-control, stress reaction, alienation, and social closeness subscale questions of the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire, the Hearing Handicap Inventory-Screening Version, TFI, and the Tinnitus Case History Questionnaire. Study Sample: A total of 154 participants with tinnitus (81 males, 73 females, mean age 5 62.6 yr) and 61 control (32 males, 29 females, mean age 5 59.62 yr) participants were recruited via e-mail invitations to a tinnitus research clinic database, poster, and social media Web site advertising. Data Collection and Analysis: Statistical analysis was conducted using parametric statistics and IBM SPSS? Version 22 software. Results: Tinnitus sufferers displayed higher levels of stress reaction, lower social closeness, lower selfcontrol, and higher alienation than the control group (p < 0.05). Alienation was related to tinnitus pitch and self-reported hyperacusis measured using the Tinnitus Case History Questionnaire (p < 0.05). Stress reaction correlated with self-reported hyperacusis, whether tinnitus sufferers had sought other treatments, and whether loud sounds make the tinnitus worse (p < 0.05). Conclusions: The four personality traits examined in this study exhibited a consistent association with tinnitus perception and distress, and differentiated tinnitus sufferers from nontinnitus control. Some of the traits also correlated significantly with certain characteristicsmeasured in tinnitus history questionnaires. Personality traits are described in relation to ""maladaptive"" residuals under the Adaptation Level Theorymodel of tinnitus.

Data included all clinical parameters and proteinuria in a 24?h urine collection. In cases of severe preeclampsia, significantly fewer patients had proteinuria levels <0.3?g/L in comparison to any of the other groups with proteinuria >0.3?g/L, but there was no difference in cases of severe preeclampsia when proteinuria levels were >0.3?g/L. Furthermore, when proteinuria levels were >0.3?g/L, the frequency of severe preeclampsia in each group was significantly higher than the frequency of mild pre-eclampsia cases.

The success of liver resection (LR) for other metastatic disease has led centres to explore the option of LR for patients with isolated breast cancer liver metastases (BCLM). A number of small series have been published in the literature, however the evidence is conflicting. This study aimed to systematically review the literature to determine the perioperative outcome and survival of patients undergoing LR for BCLM. Methods An electronic search of Medline and Embase databases was performed to identify all published series. Patient demographics, management, peri-operative outcome and overall survival (OS) were obtained. Results A total of 1705 articles were identified of which 531 included patients with non-colorectal and non-neuroendocrine metastases. 43 articles including 1686 patients, met?all the inclusion and exclusion criteria. R0 resection was achieved in 83% (683/825). Morbidity and 30-day mortality rates were 20% (174/852) and 0.7% (6/918), respectively. The median OS was 36 months (12–58 months). The median 1-, 3-and 5-year OS were 90%, 56% and 37%, respectively.

Many miRNAs have been linked to the development of hallmarks of cancer. miRNAs represent valuable therapeutic targets to exploit in the search for novel cancer treatments, due to their ubiquitous expression and their ability to tightly regulate the gene expression of a whole host of genes and pathways in a single hit. The miRNA system may be harnessed for therapeutic use either through replacement of tumour suppressive miRNAs lost in cancer, or through inhibition of oncogenic miRNAs overexpressed in cancer. There is a large body of work investigating optimal systemic and localised delivery strategies, and while miRNA therapeutics show promise, it is clear that further developments to delivery strategies may be required to allow safe translation of miRNAs to the clinic. The information gleaned from miRNA signatures as biomarkers is already proving invaluable in the fight to better understand and treat individual tumours, and there is great promise to the applications of these small, but mighty molecules in the future of cancer therapeutics.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] ? 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,antagomir; antineoplastic agent; doxorubicin; gefitinib; liposome; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 107; microRNA 135a; microRNA 182; microRNA 192; microRNA 203; microRNA 205; microRNA 215; microRNA 221; microRNA 222; microRNA 29; microRNA 34; microRNA 342 5p; microRNA 34a; microRNA 96; microRNA let 7b; miravirsen; mrx 34; nanoparticle; paclitaxel; small interfering RNA; tamoxifen; trastuzumab; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; microRNA; allergic rhinitis; Article; cancer inhibition; cell cycle arrest; cytokine release syndrome; drug efficacy; drug fatality; drug resistance; drug safety; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression regulation; gene overexpression; gene replacement therapy; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; hydrogel; liposomal delivery; liver cancer; liver cell carcinoma; malignant neoplasm; melanoma; metastasis; multiple myeloma; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; oncogene; ovary cancer; rhabdomyosarcoma; RNA sequence; tumor immunity; tumor suppressor gene; genetics; Neoplasms; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms,2-s2.0-85010985277

Compared to standard-exposure cyclosporine, everolimus with reduced exposure to cyclosporine may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer, particularly for non-melanoma skin cancer. Thus, if confirmed in larger patient cohorts, de novo use of everolimus with reduced exposure to calcineurin inhibitors may enable a reduction in cancer burden after transplantation. ? 2017 International Society of Nephrology",A2309 trial; ANZDATA; cancer; cyclosporine; epidemiology; everolimus,"cyclosporin; everolimus; mycophenolic acid; calcineurin inhibitor; cyclosporin; everolimus; immunosuppressive agent; mycophenolic acid; adult; Article; bk virus infection; cancer chemotherapy; cancer risk; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; cytomegalovirus infection; drug efficacy; drug exposure; drug withdrawal; edema; female; follow up; graft recipient; human; hyperlipidemia; kidney graft; kidney graft rejection; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; non melanoma skin cancer; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial; risk assessment; viremia; wound complication; Australia; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; comparative study; drug effects; graft rejection; graft survival; immunology; incidence; intention to treat analysis; Kaplan Meier method; kidney transplantation; middle aged; multicenter study; Neoplasms; New Zealand; proportional hazards model; protection; register; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; Adult; Australia; Calcineurin Inhibitors; Cyclosporine; Drug Therapy, Combination; Everolimus; Female; Graft Rejection; Graft Survival; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Incidence; Intention to Treat Analysis; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Mycophenolic Acid; Neoplasms; New Zealand; Proportional Hazards Models; Protective Factors; Registries; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85009815140

Reprogramming technology offers the ability to untangle the diverse contributing risk factors for PD, such as ageing, genetics and environmental toxins. In order to gain novel insights into such a complex disease, cell-based models of PD should represent, as closely as possible, aged human dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. However, the generation of high yields of functionally mature, authentic ventral midbrain dopamine (vmDA) neurons has not been easy to achieve. Furthermore, ensuring cells represent aged rather than embryonic neurons has presented a significant challenge. To date, induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells have received much attention for modelling PD. Nonetheless, direct reprogramming strategies (either to a neuronal or neural stem/progenitor fate) represent a valid alternative that are yet to be extensively explored. Direct reprogramming is faster and more efficient than iPS cell reprogramming, and appears to conserve age-related markers. At present, however, protocols aiming to derive authentic, mature vmDA neurons by direct reprogramming of adult human somatic cells are sorely lacking. This review will discuss the strategies that have been employed to generate vmDA neurons and their potential for the study and treatment of PD. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Direct reprogramming; Disease modelling; Dopamine neurons; Induced neural stem cells; Induced neurons; Induced pluripotent stem cells; Parkinson’s disease; Reprogramming,"activin A; ascorbic acid; brain derived neurotrophic factor; bucladesine; fibroblast growth factor 8; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; growth factor; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta; octamer transcription factor 4; sonic hedgehog protein; synuclein; tau protein; transcription factor Gli1; transcription factor PAX2; transcription factor Sox2; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta3; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; carcinogenesis; cell fusion; cell transdifferentiation; dopaminergic nerve cell; gene editing; gene mutation; human; hypoxia; nuclear reprogramming; Parkinson disease; priority journal; protein expression; Review; biological model; cell differentiation; cytology; genetics; induced pluripotent stem cell; metabolism; neural stem cell; Parkinson disease; stem cell transplantation; substantia nigra; transplantation; Cell Differentiation; Cellular Reprogramming; Dopaminergic Neurons; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Models, Neurological; Neural Stem Cells; Parkinson Disease; Stem Cell Transplantation; Substantia Nigra",2-s2.0-85009273512

Modulated Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-Term Depression (LTD) have been repeatedly demonstrated in aged rodents, however the translation to human research has been limited by a scarcity of non-invasive methods for doing so. We have previously demonstrated that, following a block of high frequency presentations of a visual stimulus (referred to as a “visual tetanus”), there is a LTP-like enhancement of the N1b component of the visually evoked potential (VEP) to subsequent low frequency presentations of the same stimulus. The aims of the current study were, firstly, to use this electroencephalography (EEG) paradigm to assess age group differences in neocortical plasticity in humans, and secondly, to expand on the visual LTP paradigm by examining plasticity in another component of the VEP; the P2a. While a young participant group (N = 29, age range = 19–35) demonstrated the expected LTP-like enhancement of the N1b immediately following the visual tetanus, an older participant group (N = 19, age range = 68–91) did not. However, both age groups demonstrated a positive shift of the P2a component after repeated presentations of low frequency baseline blocks, which is hypothesized to be an LTD-like shift in the VEP. These results support the rodent literature indicating an age-related shift in threshold for LTP, but a relative preservation of the threshold for LTD. This study not only provides valuable insight into healthy age-related alterations in neocortical plasticity, but is also the first to identify an LTD-like modulation of the VEP in humans. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Ageing; EEG; LTD; LTP; Neocortical plasticity; VEP,"adult; age; aged; Article; electroencephalography; female; groups by age; human; long term depression; long term potentiation; male; nerve cell plasticity; occipital cortex; priority journal; tetanus; visual evoked potential; visual stimulation; young adult; aging; neocortex; photostimulation; physiology; very elderly; visual evoked potential; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Humans; Long-Term Potentiation; Male; Neocortex; Neuronal Plasticity; Photic Stimulation; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85009188351

The aim of this study was to explore whether risk factors differ for depression symptoms that are present during pregnancy and/or after childbirth. Methods An ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample of 5301 women completed interviews during the third trimester of pregnancy and 9?months after childbirth. Depression symptoms were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Depression symptoms (defined as EPDS >12) among participants and associations with pre-pregnancy and pregnancy maternal characteristics were explored using logistic regression. Results The rate of antenatal depression symptoms (ADS) only was 8.5, 5% of women had depression symptoms at 9?months postpartum (PDS) only and 3% experienced depression symptoms at both time points. Perceived stress and Pacific or Asian ethnicity were risk factors for ADS and PDS. Anxiety during and before pregnancy was a risk factor for ADS only while having a pre-pregnancy diagnosis of depression was a risk factor for PDS only. Having ADS increased the odds ratio of PDS by 1.5 (95% CI 1.01–2.30). Conclusions The results supported evidence from previous longitudinal studies that depression symptoms appear to be higher during pregnancy than in the first year following childbirth. The study found that PDS may often be a continuation or recurrence of ADS. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Antenatal depression; Cohort study; Growing Up in New Zealand; Longitudinal research; Perceived stress; Postnatal depression,"adult; anxiety disorder; comparative study; female; human; longitudinal study; mother; New Zealand; postnatal depression; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnant woman; prenatal care; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; third trimester pregnancy; young adult; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Mothers; New Zealand; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Pregnant Women; Prenatal Care; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84994730536

Design The research adopted a qualitative methodology that was consistent with a Kaupapa M?ori research approach. Seven semi-structured interviews were conducted with grandparents to collect narrative data. Setting Sampling occurred in one Auckland suburb. The suburb was selected because of its high level of socio-economic deprivation and ethnic diversity. Subjects Seven grandparents participated in the study (five M?ori and two Samoan). Each participant met the inclusion criteria (i.e. they had provided at least five meals per week over the previous three months to grandchildren aged less than 24 months). Marae (i.e. meeting houses and areas used by local M?ori tribes/sub-tribes) and community organisations were used to recruit participants. Results A general inductive thematic analysis identified four key themes: (i) grandparents' understanding of optimal feeding practices; (ii) economic and material factors; (iii) previous experiences and customary norms; and (iv) social support and societal pressure. Conclusions The study showed that grandparents' complementary feeding practices in caring for infant grandchildren were influenced by upstream structural elements such as government policies related to welfare and pensions, employment, income and cultural knowledge. Frameworks that seek to achieve social justice and support cultural practices should be employed and promoted in the development of future policy and research in this area. ? 2016 The Authors.",Child health; Infant feeding practices; Kaupapa M?ori research; M?ori health,"attitude to health; demography; diet; evaluation study; feeding behavior; female; grandparent; health behavior; human; infant; middle aged; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; preschool child; psychology; social support; socioeconomics; Child, Preschool; Diet; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Feeding Behavior; Female; Grandparents; Health Behavior; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infant; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Residence Characteristics; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors",2-s2.0-84994669257

G proteins lie in the heart of GPCRs signalling and therefore can be therapeutically targeted to overcome complexities in GPCR responses and signalling. G proteins are classified into four families (Gi, Gs, G12/13 and Gq); Gq is further subdivided into four classes. Among them Gαq and Gαq/11 isoforms are most crucial and ubiquitously expressed; these isoforms are almost 88% similar at their amino acid sequence but may exhibit functional divergences. However, uncertainties often arise about Gαq and Gαq/11 inhibitors, these G proteins might also have suitability to the invention of novel-specific inhibitors for each isoforms. YM-254890 and UBO-QIC are discovered as potent inhibitors of Gαq functions and also investigated in thrombin protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 inhibitors and platelet aggregation inhibition. The most likely G protein involved in PAR-1 stimulates responses is one of the Gαq family isoforms. In this review, we highlight the molecular structures and pharmacological responses of Gαq family which may reflect the biochemical and molecular role of Gαq and Gαq/11.

Methods: 5004 participants free of known CVD had magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 2000-2002. Cine images were analysed to compute, SV = volume/(length3 x π/6) equivalent to LV volume/volume of sphere with length of LV as the diameter. The highest (greatest sphericity) and lowest (lowest sphericity) quintiles of SVI were compared against the reference group (2-4 quintiles combined). Risk-factor adjusted hazard's ratio (HR) from Cox regression assessed the predictive performance of SVI at end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) to predict incident outcomes over 10 years in retrospective interpretation of prospective data. Results: At baseline, participants were aged 61 ±10 years; 52% men and 39%/13%/26%/22% Cauc/Chinese/Afr-Amer/Hispanic. Low sphericity was associated with higher Framingham CVD risk, greater coronary calcium score and higher N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP); while increased sphericity was associated with higher NT-proBNP and lower ejection fraction. Low sphericity predicted incident CHD (HR: 1.48, 1.55-2.59 at ED) and CVD (HR: 1.82, 1.47-2.27 at ED). However, both low (HR: 1.81, 1.20-2.73 at ES) and high (HR: 2.21, 1.41-3.46 at ES) sphericity predicted incident HF. High sphericity also predicted AF. Conclusions: In a multiethnic population free of CVD at baseline, lowest sphericity was a predictor of incident CHD, CVD and HF over a 10-year follow-up period. Extreme sphericity was a strong predictor of incident HF and AF. SVI improved risk prediction models beyond established risk factors only for HF, but not for all CVD or CHD. ? 2017, BMJ Publishing Group.

Given a CT-segmented airway skeleton and surface, the proposed CL-based method automatically constructs subject-specific models that contain anatomical information regarding branches, include bifurcations and trifurcations, and extend from the trachea to terminal bronchioles. The resulting model can be anatomically realistic with the assistance of an image-based surface; alternatively a model with an idealized skeleton and/or branch diameters is also possible. This method systematically identifies and classifies trifurcations to successfully construct the models, which also provides the number and type of trifurcations for the analysis of the airways from an anatomical point of view. We applied this method to 16 normal and 16 severe asthmatic subjects using their computed tomography images. The average distance between the surface of the model and the image-based surface was 11?% of the average voxel size of the image. The four most frequent locations of trifurcations were the left upper division bronchus, left lower lobar bronchus, right upper lobar bronchus, and right intermediate bronchus. The proposed method automatically constructed accurate subject-specific three-dimensional airway geometric models that contain anatomical information regarding branches using airway skeleton, diameters, and image-based surface geometry. The proposed method can construct (i) geometry automatically for population-based studies, (ii) trifurcations to retain the original airway topology, (iii) geometry that can be used for automatic generation of computational fluid dynamics meshes, and (iv) geometry based only on a skeleton and diameters for idealized branches. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Computed tomography; Geometric fitting; Simulation; Visualization,"Computational fluid dynamics; Computational geometry; Flow visualization; Geometry; Musculoskeletal system; Respiratory system; Tomography; Anatomical information; Automatic construction; Automatic Generation; Computed tomography images; Geometric fitting; Simulation; Subject specific models; Surface geometries; Computerized tomography; airway; Article; asthma; automation; clinical article; controlled study; geometry; human; image analysis; lobar bronchus; priority journal; surface property; x-ray computed tomography; anatomy and histology; biological model; diagnostic imaging; lung; personalized medicine; trachea; x-ray computed tomography; Asthma; Humans; Lung; Models, Biological; Precision Medicine; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Trachea",2-s2.0-84990852357

However, several recent studies have reported an absence of GDM phenotype in their colony. We investigated several hypotheses for why the phenotype may be absent, with the aim of re-establishing it and preventing further resources being wasted on an ineffective model. Experiments were carried out across two laboratories in two countries (New Zealand and China), and were designed to assess type of control strain, diet, presence of the misty allele, and parity as potential contributors to the lost phenotype. While hyperleptinemia and pre-pregnancy weight gain were present in all db/+mice across the four studies, we found no consistent evidence of glucose intolerance or insulin resistance during pregnancy.

By investigating the influence of load carriage during exercises on the kinematics and kinetics of the body and on the biomechanical responses of bones, such as the tibia, we can quantify the role of load carriage on bone health. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study using an integrated musculoskeletal-finite-element model to analyze how the amount of load carriage in women affected the kinematics and kinetics of the body, as well as the tibial mechanical stress during running. We also compared the biomechanics of walking (studied previously) and running under various load-carriage conditions. Results: We observed substantial changes in both hip kinematics and kinetics during running when subjects carried a load. Relative to those observed during running without load, the joint reaction forces at the hip increased by an average of 49.1% body weight when subjects carried a load that was 30% of their body weight (ankle, 4.8%; knee, 20.6%). These results indicate that the hip extensor muscles in women are the main power generators when running with load carriage. When comparing running with walking, finite element analysis revealed that the peak tibial stress during running (tension, 90.6 MPa; compression, 136.2 MPa) was more than three times as great as that during walking (tension, 24.1 MPa; compression, 40.3 MPa), whereas the cumulative stress within one stride did not differ substantially between running (15.2 MPa · s) and walking (13.6 MPa · s). Conclusions: Our findings highlight the critical role of hip extensor muscles and their potential injury in women when running with load carriage. More importantly, our results underscore the need to incorporate the cumulative effect of mechanical stress when evaluating injury risk under various exercise conditions. The results from our study help to elucidate the mechanisms of stress fracture in women. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Finite element analysis; Load carriage; Running mechanics; Stress fracture; Tibial mechanical stress,"adduction; adult; anthropometry; Article; biceps femoris muscle; biomechanics; body weight; controlled study; cross-sectional study; endurance training; extensor muscle; female; finite element analysis; gastrocnemius muscle; ground reaction force; hamstring muscle; hip muscle; human; kinematics; load carriage; mechanical stress; muscle contraction; muscle strength; muscle tone; rectus femoris muscle; running; soldier; soleus muscle; stress fracture; tibia; tibialis anterior muscle; training; vastus lateralis muscle; vastus medialis muscle; walking; anatomy and histology; ankle; comparative study; electromyography; Fractures, Stress; hip; knee; physiology; skeletal muscle; tibia; Tibial Fractures; weight bearing; Adult; Ankle Joint; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cross-Sectional Studies; Electromyography; Female; Finite Element Analysis; Fractures, Stress; Hip; Humans; Knee Joint; Military Personnel; Muscle, Skeletal; Running; Stress, Mechanical; Tibia; Tibial Fractures; Walking; Weight-Bearing",2-s2.0-85016084021

The underlying causes are multifactorial, but include exposure to hypoxia. Immaturity of organs and their functional control may impair the physiological defence responses to hypoxia and the preterm fetal responses, or lack thereof, to moderate hypoxia appear to support this concept. However, as this review demonstrates, despite immaturity, the preterm fetus responds to asphyxia in a qualitatively similar manner to that seen at term. This highlights the importance in understanding metabolism versus homeostatic threat when assessing fetal responses to adverse challenges such as hypoxia. Data are presented to show that the preterm fetal adaptation to asphyxia is triphasic in nature. Phase one represents the rapid institution of maximal defences, designed to maintain blood pressure and central perfusion at the expense of peripheral organs. Phase two is one of adaptive compensation. Controlled reperfusion partially offsets peripheral tissue oxygen debt, while maintaining sufficient vasoconstriction to limit the fall in perfusion. Phase three is about decompensation. Strikingly, the preterm fetus generally performs better during phases two and three, and can survive for longer without injury. Paradoxically, however, the ability to survive can lead to longer exposure to hypotension and hypoperfusion and thus potentially greater injury. The effects of fetal sex, inflammation and drugs on the triphasic adaptations are reviewed. Finally, the review highlights the need for more comprehensive studies to understand the complexity of perinatal physiology if we are to develop effective strategies to improve preterm outcomes.

Airway remodeling in asthmatics contributes to fixed airflow obstruction and can amplify airway narrowing caused by ASM activation. Previous modeling studies have shown that the increase in ASM mass has the largest effect on increasing maximal airway narrowing. Simulated heterogeneity in the dimensions and properties of the airway wall can further amplify airway narrowing. Using measurements made on histological sections from donor lungs, we show for the first time that there is profound heterogeneity of ASM area and wall area in both nonasthmatics and asthmatics. Using a mathematical model, we found that this heterogeneity, together with changes in the mean values, contributes to an increased baseline resistance and elastance in asthmatics as well as a leftward shift in the responsiveness of the airways to a simulated agonist in both nonasthmatics and asthmatics. The ability of heterogeneous wall dimensions to shift the dose-response curve is largely due to an increased susceptibility for the small airways to close. This research confirms that heterogeneity of airway wall dimensions can contribute to exaggerated airway narrowing and provides an actual assessment of the magnitude of these effects. ? 2017 the American Physiological Society.",Airway hyperresponsiveness; Airway resistance; Asthma; Remodeling,"corticosteroid; methacholine; steroid; methacholine chloride; adolescent; adult; airway obstruction; airway remodeling; airway resistance; Article; asthma; breathing muscle; child; clinical article; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; disease simulation; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; lung compliance; lung function; male; mathematical model; priority journal; respiratory tract allergy; statistical model; steroid therapy; terminal care; asthma; biomechanics; demography; drug effect; impedance; lung; lung function test; middle aged; pathophysiology; preschool child; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Asthma; Biomechanical Phenomena; Child; Child, Preschool; Demography; Electric Impedance; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Methacholine Chloride; Middle Aged; Respiratory Function Tests; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85015256377

Study Design: The primary outcome measure was the Tinnitus Functional Index (TFI). Secondary measures were: loudness and annoyance ratings, loudness level matches, minimum masking levels, positive and negative emotionality, attention reaction and discrimination time, anxiety, depression and stress. Each sound was administered using MP3 players with earbuds for 8 continuous weeks, with a 3 week wash-out period before crossing over to the other treatment sound. Measurements were undertaken for each arm at sound fitting, 4 and 8 weeks after administration. Qualitative interviews were conducted at each of these appointments. Results: From a baseline TFI score of 41.3, sound therapy resulted in TFI scores at 8 weeks of 35.6; broadband noise resulted in significantly greater reduction (8.2 points) after 8 weeks of sound therapy use than nature sounds (3.2 points). The positive effect of sound on tinnitus was supported by secondary outcome measures of tinnitus, emotion, attention, and psychological state, but not interviews. Tinnitus loudness level match was higher for BBN at 8 weeks; while there was little change in loudness level matches for nature sounds. There was no change in minimum masking levels following sound therapy administration. Self-reported preference for one sound over another did not correlate with changes in tinnitus. Conclusions: Modeled under an adaptation level theory framework of tinnitus perception, the results indicate that the introduction of broadband noise shifts internal adaptation level weighting away from the tinnitus signal, reducing tinnitus magnitude. Nature sounds may modify the affective components of tinnitus via a secondary, residual pathway, but this appears to be less important for sound effectiveness. The different rates of adaptation to broadband noise and nature sound by the auditory system may explain the different tinnitus loudness level matches. In addition to group effects there also appears to be a great deal of individual variation. A sound therapy framework based on adaptation level theory is proposed that accounts for individual variation in preference and response to sound. ? 2017 Durai and Searchfield.",Adaptation; Auditory perception; Clinical trial; Ecology model; Psychoacoustics; Sound therapy; Tinnitus,adaptation level theory; adult; aged; anxiety; Article; attention; auditory discrimination; auditory masking; clinical article; controlled study; crossover procedure; depression; emotion; female; hearing impairment; human; loudness; male; mental stress; neurologic disease assessment; noise; qualitative research; quantitative study; randomized controlled trial; self report; sound therapy; theory; tinnitus; Tinnitus Functional Index,2-s2.0-85017403636

In this context, this study aims to survey, analyze and compare prices of medicines that likely contribute to high expenditure for the public payers in high-income countries. Methods: We chose the following 16 European countries: Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Slovakia, Spain and United Kingdom. The ex-factory price data of 30 medicines in these countries were collected in national databases accessible through the Pharmaceutical Price Information (PPI) service of Gesundheit ?sterreich GmbH (Austrian Public Health Institute). Results: The ex-factory prices (median) per unit (e.g. per tablet, vial) ranged from 10.67 cent (levodopa + decarboxylase inhibitor) to 17,000 euro (ipilimumab). A total of 53% of the medicines surveyed had a unit ex-factory price (median) above 200 Euro. For two thirds of the medicines, price differences between the highest-priced country and lowest-priced country ranged between 25 and 100%; the remaining medicines, mainly low-priced medicines, had higher price differential, up to 251%. Medicines with unit prices of a few euros or less were medicines for the treatment of diseases in the nervous system (anti-depressants, medicines to treat Parkinson and for the management of neuropathic pain), of obstructive airway diseases and cardio-vascular medicines (lipid modifying agents). High-priced medicines were particularly cancer medicines. Conclusion: Medicine prices of Greece, Hungary, Slovakia and UK were frequently at the lower end, German and Swedish, as well as Danish and Irish prices at the upper end. For high-priced medicines, actual paid prices are likely to be lower due to confidential discounts and similar funding arrangements between industry and public payers. Pricing authorities refer to the higher undiscounted prices when they use price data from other countries for their pricing decisions. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",comparison; discounts; Europe; external price referencing; High-cost medicines; medicine prices; price analysis; price study; price survey; transparency,"alteplase; anidulafungin; antidepressant agent; antilipemic agent; azacitidine; beta1a interferon; bevacizumab; bortezomib; bosentan; caspofungin; decarboxylase inhibitor; duloxetine; enoxaparin; ezetimibe plus simvastatin; glatiramer; golimumab; infliximab; insulin aspart; ipilimumab; lenalidomide; leuprorelin; levodopa; linezolid; pemetrexed; pregabalin; ranibizumab; rituximab; tiotropium bromide; trastuzumab; unindexed drug; drug; Article; Austria; Belgium; controlled study; Denmark; drug cost; Finland; France; Germany; Greece; Hungary; Ireland; Italy; Netherlands; Portugal; Slovakia; Spain; Sweden; United Kingdom; commercial phenomena; cost; decision making; developed country; drug cost; drug industry; economics; Europe; factual database; human; statistics and numerical data; Commerce; Costs and Cost Analysis; Databases, Factual; Decision Making; Developed Countries; Drug Costs; Drug Industry; Europe; Humans; Pharmaceutical Preparations",2-s2.0-84991032520

Objectives To compare reaction profiles from food challenges and parent-reported reactions on accidental ingestion, and assess predictors of severe reactions. Methods HealthNuts is a longitudinal population-based cohort study of 5276 1-year-old infants. Infants underwent skin prick tests and those with identifiable wheals were offered food challenges. Food challenges were repeated at age 4 years in those with previous food allergy or reporting new food allergies. Community-reported reactions were ascertained from parent questionnaires. Results Food challenges were undertaken in 916 children at age 1 year and 357 children at age 4 years (a total of 2047 peanut, egg, or sesame challenges). Urticaria was the most common sign in positive challenges at both ages (age 1 year, 88.7%, and age 4 years, 71.2%) although angioedema was significantly more common at age 4 years (40.1%) than at age 1 year (12.9%). Anaphylaxis was equally uncommon at both ages (2.1% and 2.8% of positive challenges at ages 1 and 4 years, respectively) but more common for peanut than for egg (4.5% and 1.2% of positive challenges at ages 1 and 4 years, respectively). The patterns of presenting signs reported during community reactions were similar to those observed in formal food challenges. Serum food-specific IgE levels of 15 kU/L or more were associated with moderate to severe reactions but skin prick test was not. Conclusions There was a shift from the most common presenting reaction of urticaria during food challenges toward more angioedema in older children. Serum food-specific IgE levels were associated with reaction severity. ? 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",Anaphylaxis; Angioedema; Community reactions; Egg allergy; Food allergy; Oral food challenge; Peanut allergy; Reaction profiles; Sesame allergy; Skin prick test; Specific IgE; Urticaria,"immunoglobulin E; allergen; immunoglobulin E; allergic reaction; angioneurotic edema; Article; child; clinical skin reaction; clinical trial; cohort analysis; community assessment; controlled study; egg allergy; food allergy; food intake; human; hypotension; immunization; ingestion; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; peanut allergy; population research; predictor variable; provocation test; sesame; skin anaphylaxis; urticaria; vomiting; wheezing; anaphylaxis; Arachis; blood; complication; egg; Egg Hypersensitivity; female; immunology; infant; oral drug administration; Peanut Hypersensitivity; preschool child; procedures; questionnaire; Sesamum; Administration, Oral; Allergens; Anaphylaxis; Arachis; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Egg Hypersensitivity; Eggs; Female; Humans; Immunization; Immunoglobulin E; Infant; Male; Peanut Hypersensitivity; Sesamum; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85021154392

In 13-36% of women, stretching results in avulsion injury whereby the puborectalis muscle disconnects from its insertion points on the pubis bone. Until now, few studies have investigated the effect of this lesion on pelvic floor muscles in the early postpartum period. Objective The primary aim of this study was to compare pelvic floor muscle morphometry and function in primiparous women with and without puborectalis avulsion in the early postpartum period. Our secondary objective was to compare the 2 groups for pelvic floor disorders and impact on quality of life. Study Design In all, 52 primiparous women diagnosed with (n?= 22) or without (n?= 30) puborectalis avulsion injury were assessed at 3 months postpartum. Pelvic floor muscle morphometry was evaluated with 3-/4-dimensional transperineal ultrasound at rest, maximal contraction, and Valsalva maneuver. Different parameters were measured in the midsagittal and axial planes: bladder neck position, levator plate angle, anorectal angle, and levator hiatus dimensions. The dynamometric speculum was used to assess pelvic floor muscle function including: passive properties (passive forces and stiffness) during dynamic stretches, maximal strength, speed of contraction, and endurance. Pelvic floor disorder–related symptoms (eg, urinary incontinence, vaginal and bowel symptoms) and impact on quality of life were evaluated with the International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire and the Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire-Short Form. Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification was also assessed. Results In comparison to women without avulsion, women with avulsion presented an enlarged hiatus area at rest, maximal contraction, and Valsalva maneuver (P ? .013) and all other ultrasound parameters were found to be significantly altered during maximal contraction (P ? .014). They showed lower passive forces at maximal and 20-mm vaginal apertures as well as lower stiffness at 20-mm aperture (P ? .048). Significantly lower strength, speed of contraction, and endurance were also found in women with avulsion (P ? .005). They also presented more urinary incontinence symptoms (P?= .040) whereas vaginal and bowel symptoms were found to be similar in the 2 groups. Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification revealed greater anterior compartment descent in women with avulsion (P ? .010). The impact of pelvic floor disorders on quality of life was found to be significantly higher in women with avulsion (P?= .038). Conclusion This study confirms that pelvic floor muscle morphometry and function are impaired in primiparous women with puborectalis avulsion in the early postpartum period. Moreover, it highlights specific muscle parameters that are altered such as passive properties, strength, speed of contraction, and endurance. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",childbirth; dynamometry; pelvic floor disorders; puborectalis avulsion; ultrasound,adult; avulsion injury; bladder neck; Conference Paper; controlled study; endurance; enteropathy; female; four dimensional echocardiography; human; ICIQ (incontinence); major clinical study; morphometry; muscle length; Pelvic Floor Impact Questionnaire Short Form; Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification; pelvis floor muscle; priority journal; puborectalis avulsion; puerperium; quality of life; quality of life assessment; three dimensional imaging; ultrasound; urinary tract disease assessment; urine incontinence; vagina disease; vaginal delivery; Valsalva maneuver; velocity; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; echography; injuries; pathology; pathophysiology; Pelvic Floor Disorders; pelvis floor; puerperium; time factor; Adult; Female; Humans; Pelvic Floor; Pelvic Floor Disorders; Postpartum Period; Time Factors; Ultrasonography,2-s2.0-85019902795

To determine mortality rates and predictors of death at baseline in people with a recent onset of gout. Methods. People with gout disease duration < 10 years were recruited from primary and secondary care settings. Comprehensive clinical assessment was completed at baseline. Participants were prospectively followed for at least 1 year. Information about death was systematically collected from primary and secondary health records. Standardized mortality ratios (SMR) were calculated and risk factors for mortality were analyzed using Cox proportional hazard regression models. Results. The mean (SD) followup duration was 5.1 (1.6) years (a total 1511 patient-yrs accrued). Of the 295 participants, 43 (14.6%) had died at the time of censorship (SMR 1.96, 95% CI 1.44-2.62). In the reduced Cox proportional hazards model, these factors were independently associated with an increased risk of death from all causes: older age (70-80 yrs: HR 9.96, 95% CI 3.30-30.03; 80-91 yrs: HR 9.39, 95% CI 2.68-32.89), Maori or Pacific ethnicity (HR 2.48, 95% CI 1.17-5.29), loop diuretic use (HR 3.99, 95% CI 2.15-7.40), serum creatinine (per 10 μmol/l change; HR 1.04, 95% CI 1.00-1.07), and the presence of subcutaneous tophi (HR 2.85, 95% CI 1.49-5.44). The presence of subcutaneous tophi was the only baseline variable independently associated with both cardiovascular (CV) cause of death (HR 3.13, 95% CI 1.38-7.10) and non-CV cause of death (HR 3.48, 95% CI 1.25-9.63). Conclusion. People with gout disease duration < 10 years have an increased risk of death. The presence of subcutaneous tophi at baseline is an independent predictor of mortality, from both CV and non-CV causes. Copyright ? 2017.

Objectives: We examined this in a large, prospective study of older heavy smokers from the American College of Radiology Imaging Network subcohort of the National Lung Screening Trial (ACRIN). Airflow limitation was defined by prebronchodilator spirometry subgrouped according to Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 1-4. Methods: In the National Lung Screening Trial-ACRIN cohort of 18,473 screening participants, 6,436 had airflow limitation (35%) and 12,037 (65%) had no airflow limitation. From these groups, 758 lung cancer cases were prospectively identified. Participants with airflow limitation were stratified according to GOLD groups 1 (n = 1,607), 2 (n = 3,528), 3 (n = 1,083), and 4 (n = 211). Lung cancer incidence at study end (mean follow-up, 6.4 yr) was compared between the GOLD groups and those with no airflow limitation (referent group). Measurements and Main Results: Compared with those with no airflow limitation, where lung cancer incidence was 3.78/1,000 person years, incidence rates increased in a simple linear relationship: GOLD 1 (6.27/1,000 person yr); GOLD 2 (7.86/1,000 person yr); GOLD 3 (10.71/1,000 person yr); and GOLD 4 (13.25/1,000 person yr). All relationships were significant versus the reference group at a P value of 0.0001 or less. Conclusions: In a large prospective study of high-risk cigarette smokers, we report a strong linear relationship between increasing severity of airflow limitation and risk of lung cancer.

Yet, little is known about how the gendered nature of caregiving contributes to older women's understandings of providing care. Aim: To explore how gender norms constructed older women's views about the appropriate roles of women and men in providing palliative and end-of-life care for family members. Design: Six focus groups were conducted with 39 community dwelling older adults (36 women and 3 men) using two vignettes to prompt discussion about experience of end of life caring and attitudes towards Advance Care Planning. This article reports on data gathered from female participants' reactions to Vignette 1 which prompted significant discussion regarding the intersection of gender and older women's caregiving experience. Setting/participants: A total of 36 women in the age ranges of '50-59 years' through to '90-99 years' from New Zealand. Results: Three themes regarding gender and caregiving were identified: the expectation women will care, women's duty to care and women's construction of men in relation to caregiving and illness. The women adhered to stereotypical gender norms that regard women as primary caregivers. There was little connection between the burden they associated with caregiving and this gender construction. Conclusion: The expectation that older women will provide end-of-life care even when experiencing considerable burden is an unacknowledged outcome of gender norms that construct women as caregivers. ?

Previous research has examined this only using a proxy measure of value-added education (a measure of whether school-level attendance and attainment are higher than predicted by students' social profile), finding associations with smoking tobacco, use of alcohol and illicit drugs, and violence. These findings do not provide direct insights into the associations between school-level aggregate student commitment and health behaviours, and may simply reflect the proxy measure being residually confounded by unmeasured student characteristics. We examined the previously used proxy measure of value-added education, as well as direct measures at the level of the school and the student of lack of student commitment to school to see whether these were associated with students' self-reported smoking tobacco, alcohol use and school misbehaviour. Design: Cross-sectional survey. Setting: A total of 40 schools in south-east England. Methods: Multi-level analyses. Results: There were associations between school- and student-level measures of lack of commitment to school and tobacco smoking, alcohol use and school misbehaviour outcomes, but the proxy measure of school-level commitment, value-added education, was not associated with these outcomes.

In common with the population at large, student nurses have embraced this technology since the advent of the Apple iPhone in 2010. Little is known internationally or in New Zealand about the way student nurses may apply personally owned handheld referencing technology to their education process. The perceptions of New Zealand nurse managers, toward personally owned handheld referencing technology, could not be located. Using a qualitative descriptive methodology, semi structured interviews were conducted with New Zealand student nurses (n?=?13), and nurse managers (n?=?5) about their perceptions of use of personally owned handheld referencing technology as an educational tool in clinical settings. A thematic analysis was conducted on the resulting text. Student nurses said they wanted to use their own handheld referencing technology to support clinical decisions. Nurse managers perceived the use of personally owned handheld referencing technology as unprofessional, and do not trust younger cohorts of student nurses to act ethically when using this technology. This research supports historical research findings from the student perspective about the usefulness of older hand held referencing devices to augment clinical decisions. However, due to perceptions held by nurse mangers regarding professional behaviour, safety and the perceived institutional costs of managing personally owned handheld referencing technology, the practice may remain problematic in the studied setting. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Nursing education; Personally owned handheld referencing technology; Smartphone; Undergraduate student nurses information technology,"clinical article; financial management; historical research; human; information technology; New Zealand; nurse manager; nursing education; nursing student; perception; safety; semi structured interview; smartphone; tablet; thematic analysis; trust; undergraduate student; attitude to computers; female; health personnel attitude; information processing; interview; mobile application; nurse administrator; nursing education; nursing student; personal digital assistant; professionalism; psychology; qualitative research; Attitude of Health Personnel; Attitude to Computers; Computers, Handheld; Education, Nursing; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Mobile Applications; New Zealand; Nurse Administrators; Professionalism; Qualitative Research; Smartphone; Students, Nursing",2-s2.0-85010648467

Methods This study is part of a longitudinal cohort study, the Akershus Birth Cohort Study, which targeted all women giving birth at Akershus University Hospital in Norway. The current sample is comprised of 1480 women who participated at all three time points, yielding a participation rate of 32% of the 4662 women who originally consented to participate. The Bergen Insomnia Scale (BIS) was used to measure insomnia and a latent profile analysis (LPA) was used to identify subsets of women who shared a similar pattern of responses on the BIS-scale across the three time points. Pain was measured using the bodily pain scale, derived from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders (PRIME-MD) and symptoms of depression were measured by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). Results Using a latent profile analysis a three class model showed the best fit and identified one major group (55.6%) with a low BIS scores across all three time points, one group with intermediate BIS scores (32.9%), and a smaller group (11.5%) with higher BIS scores across all three times. The chronic high insomnia group had a 2.8-fold increased risk of reporting high levels of bodily pain. The chronic intermediate group was associated with a 2.2-fold increased risk of bodily pain at two years postpartum. Adjusting for demographics and lifestyle behaviors did not reduce any of the associations, while adjusting for depression significantly attenuated the associations. Additional adjustment for pain at eight weeks postpartum further reduced the magnitude of the associations, but both chronic intermediate insomnia and chronic high insomnia remained strongly associated with the onset of bodily pain in the fully adjusted models (RR?=?1.75, 95% CI: 1.37–2.23) and RR?=?1.63, 95% CI: 1.15–2.32, respectively). Conclusions The high prevalence of insomnia among women during and after childbirth, in combination with the strong prospective association with impaired physical health, emphasizes the importance of adequately identifying, preventing and treating insomnia for this population. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Epidemiology; Longitudinal; Pain; Pregnancy; Sleep,"adult; Article; Bergen Insomnia Scale; childbirth; chronic disease; cohort analysis; depression; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; female; human; insomnia; lifestyle; longitudinal study; major clinical study; model; Norway; pain assessment; population; postpartum pain; predictive value; prevalence; Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders; priority journal; psychologic assessment; rating scale; risk assessment; risk factor; university hospital; insomnia; pain; postnatal depression; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; Adult; Depression, Postpartum; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Norway; Pain; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",2-s2.0-85010223601

This study assesses the impact of PSMVR on resection margin status and survival. Method An electronic search was performed to identify relevant articles. Pooled odds ratios were calculated for outcomes using the fixed or random-effects models for meta-analysis. A decision analytical model was developed for estimating cost effectiveness. Results Sixteen studies with 4145 patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy were included: 1207 patients had PSMVR and 2938 patients had no PSMVR. The R1 resection rate and post-operative mortality was significantly higher in PSMVR group (OR1.59[1.35, 1.86] p=<0.0001, and OR1.72 [1.02,2.92] p?=?0.04 respectively). The overall survival at 5-years was worse in the PSMVR group (HR0.20 [0.07,0.55] P?=?0.020). Tumour size (p?=?0.030) and perineural invasion (P?=?0.009) were higher in the PSMVR group. Not performing PSMVR yielded cost savings of $1617 per additional month alive without reduction in overall outcome. Conclusion On the basis of retrospective data this study shows that PD with PSMVR is associated with a higher R1 rate, lower 5-year survival and is not cost-effective. It appears that PD with PSMVR can only be justified if R0 resection can be achieved. The continuing challenge is accurate selection of these patients. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Margins; Pancreatoduodenectomy; Survival; Venous resection,cancer patient; cancer survival; clinical outcome; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; human; meta analysis; mortality rate; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreaticoduodenectomy; perineural invasion; portal superior mesenteric vein resection; postoperative complication; priority journal; Review; segmentectomy; superior mesenteric vein; surgical margin; surgical mortality; surgical patient; systematic review; tumor volume; vein surgery; economics; hepatic portal vein; mesenteric vein; mortality; Pancreatic Neoplasms; pancreaticoduodenectomy; pathology; prognosis; survival rate; Humans; Mesenteric Veins; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreaticoduodenectomy; Portal Vein; Prognosis; Survival Rate,2-s2.0-85009929152

Current rehabilitation techniques are labor intensive and time consuming for therapists and difficult to perform effectively. Research suggests that starting rehabilitation during the acute or subacute stage of recovery results in better outcomes than therapy delivered in the chronic stage. To improve the gait rehabilitation process, robot-assisted gait rehabilitation has gained much interest over the past years. However, many robot-assisted rehabilitation devices have limitations; one of which is being bulky and complex to handle. Large and expensive devices that require special training to operate are less attractive to clinics and therapists, and ultimately less likely to be available to patients especially at the early stage of stroke. To address these limitations, this research proposes a new gait rehabilitation device called the linkage design gait trainer (LGT). The device is based on a walking frame design with a simple four-bar linkage ""end-effector"" mechanism to generate normal gait trajectories during general walking and exercise. The design of the four-bar linkage mechanism was optimized for a particular gait pattern. A prototype of the device was developed and tested. The kinematics of the device itself and gait kinematics with and without assistance from the device were recorded and analyzed using an optical motion capture system. The results show the linkage mechanism is able to guide the leg of the user during over ground walking. There were some differences in the hip (20.5 deg RMS) and knee (14.8 deg RMS) trajectory between the person walking with and without the device assistance. The study demonstrated the concept and feasibility of this novel gait training device. ? 2017 by ASME.",,Kinematics; Patient rehabilitation; Four-bar linkage; Gait rehabilitation; Labor intensive; Linkage mechanism; Optical motion capture; Physical disability; Rehabilitation techniques; Robot-assisted rehabilitation; Walking aids; Article; case report; cerebrovascular accident; exercise; gait disorder; human; kinematics; linkage design gait trainer; motion; motor system; normal human; rehabilitation equipment; walker; walking,2-s2.0-85007470620

Although applicable to a variety of neurological conditions, we provide direct pipeline applicative examples in the context of cerebral palsy (CP). This paper highlights technologies in: (1) patient-specific segmental rigid body models developed from magnetic resonance imaging for use in inverse kinematics and inverse dynamics pipelines; (2) efficient population-based approaches to derive skeletal models and muscle origins/insertions that are useful for population statistics and consistent creation of continuum models; (3) continuum muscle descriptions to account for complex muscle architecture including spatially varying material properties with muscle wrapping; (4) muscle and tendon properties specific to CP; and (5) neural-based electromyography-informed methods for muscle force prediction. This represents a novel modeling pipeline that couples for the first time electromyography extracted features of disrupted neuromuscular behavior with advanced numerical methods for modeling CP-specific musculoskeletal morphology and function. The translation of such pipeline to the clinical level will provide a new class of biomarkers that objectively describe the neuromusculoskeletal determinants of pathological locomotion and complement current clinical assessment techniques, which often rely on subjective judgment.

However, one or both of these inflammatory biomarkers can be normal in AC. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the discriminative powers of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with WCC and CRP in diagnosing AC. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study. For more than a period of 5?y, 1959 patients were identified from the cholecystectomy Registry. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy patients with histologic evidence of AC were included if they also had preoperative WCC and CRP measurements. Eligibility criteria were met by 177 patients. These patients were compared with 45 control subjects who had normal gallbladder histology. Results One unit of increase in the NLR was associated with a 2.5 times increase in the odds of AC (odds ratio?=?2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.5-4.1; P?<?0.0005). NLR cutoff values of 4.1 (95% CI, 3.42-4.79), 3.25 (95% CI, 1.95-4.54), and 4.17 (95% CI, 3.76-4.58) were diagnostic for the overall AC, mild, and moderate-severe AC, respectively. The NLR areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve in AC, mild, and moderate-severe AC were 94% (95% CI, 91%-97%), 87% (95% CI, 81%-93%), and 98% (95% CI, 96%-100%), respectively. The discriminative power of an NLR was superior to that of the WCC and similar to CRP for diagnosing AC and different grades of severity. Conclusions NLR can be considered as a potential inflammatory biomarker for AC. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Acute cholecystitis; C-reactive protein; Diagnosis; Inflammatory biomarkers; Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; White cell count,"biological marker; C reactive protein; biological marker; C reactive protein; acute cholecystitis; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diagnostic value; disease severity; female; gallbladder; histology; human; intermethod comparison; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; observational study; priority journal; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly; acute cholecystitis; blood; comparative study; lymphocyte count; metabolism; middle aged; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Cholecystitis, Acute; Female; Humans; Lymphocyte Count; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84994012849

We aimed to identify risk factors for ID hospitalisation in infancy within a birth cohort of NZ children, and to identify differences in risk factors between ethnic groups. Methods: We investigated an established cohort of 6846 NZ children, born in 2009–2010, with linkage to a national data set of hospitalisations. We used multivariable logistic regression to obtain odds ratios (OR) for factors associated with ID hospitalisation in the first year of life, firstly for all children, and then separately for M?ori or Pacific children. Results: In the whole cohort, factors associated with ID hospitalisation were M?ori (OR: 1.49, 95% CI: 1.17–1.89) or Pacific (2.51; 2.00–3.15) versus European maternal ethnicity, male gender (1.32; 1.13–1.55), low birthweight (1.94, 1.39–2.66), exclusive breastfeeding for <4 months (1.22, 1.04–1.43), maternal experience of health-care racism (1.60, 1.19–2.12), household deprivation (most vs. least deprived quintile of households (1.50, 1.12–2.02)), day-care attendance (1.43, 1.12–1.81) and maternal smoking (1.55, 1.26–1.91). Factors associated with ID hospitalisation for M?ori infants were high household deprivation (2.16, 1.06–5.02) and maternal smoking (1.48, 1.02–2.14); and for Pacific infants were delayed immunisation (1.72, 1.23–2.38), maternal experience of health-care racism (2.20, 1.29–3.70) and maternal smoking (1.59, 1.10–2.29). Conclusions: M?ori and Pacific children in NZ experience a high burden of ID hospitalisation. Some risk factors, for example maternal smoking, are shared, while others are ethnic-specific. Interventions aimed at preventing ID hospitalisations should address both shared and ethnic-specific factors. ? 2016 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",ethnic disparity; infant; infection; M?ori; Pacific Islanders,"Article; breast feeding; cohort analysis; day care; ethnicity; European; female; gastrointestinal infection; health disparity; hospitalization; human; immunization; infancy; infant; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); maternal smoking; New Zealand; perinatal infection; racism; respiratory tract infection; risk factor; sex difference; skin infection; soft tissue infection; urogenital tract infection; Caucasian; Communicable Diseases; ethnology; factual database; hospitalization; Oceanic ancestry group; Communicable Diseases; Databases, Factual; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Male; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-84990975364

However, like all industries, health care is exposed to potentially disruptive technological changes. Automated dispensing systems have been available to pharmacy for over a decade and have been applied to a range of repetitive technical processes which are at risk of error, including record keeping, item selection, labeling and dose packing. To date, most applications of this technology have been at the local level, such as hospital pharmacies or single-site community pharmacies. However, widespread implementation of a more centralized automated dispensing model, such as the ‘hub and spoke’ model currently being debated in the United Kingdom, could cause a ‘technology shock,’ delivering industry-wide efficiencies, improving medication accessibility and lowering costs to consumers and funding agencies. Some of pharmacists' historical roles may be made redundant, and new roles may be created, decoupling pharmacists to a certain extent from the dispensing and supply process. It may also create an additional opportunity for pharmacists to be acknowledged and renumerated for professional services that extend beyond the dispensary. Such a change would have significant implications for the organization and funding of community pharmacy services as well as pharmacy workforce planning. This paper discusses the prospect of centralized automated dispensing systems and how this may impact on the pharmacy workforce. It concludes that more work needs to be done in the realm of pharmacy workforce planning to ensure that the introduction of any new technology delivers optimal outcomes to consumers, insurers and the pharmacy workforce. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Automation; Community pharmacy; Workforce,"automation; consumer; funding; hospital pharmacy; human; model; pharmacist; United Kingdom; health care delivery; manpower; medical technology; organization and management; pharmaceutics; pharmacist; pharmacy; professional standard; trends; Automation; Biomedical Technology; Community Pharmacy Services; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Pharmacists; Professional Role; Technology, Pharmaceutical",2-s2.0-84973514453

Nurses and lay workers treated culture-proven GAS sore throats (including siblings) with 10 days of amoxicillin. ARF cases were identified from a population-based secondary prophylaxis register. Annual pharyngeal GAS prevalence was assessed in a subset. RESULTS:: ARF rates in 5-13 year olds dropped from 88 (95% CI 79, 111)/100,000 pre-clinics to 37 (95% CI 15, 83)/100,000 after 2 years of clinic availability, a 58% reduction.No change in rate was demonstrated before the introduction of clinics (p=0.88, incidence risk ratio (IRR) for a one year change 0.98 (95% CI 0.63, 1.52)) but there was a significant decrease of first presentation ARF rates with time following the introduction of the sore throat program (p=0.008, IRR 0.61 (95% CI 0.43, 0.88)).Pharyngeal GAS cross sectional prevalence fell from 22.4% (16.5, 30.5) pre-intervention to 11.9% (8.6, 16.5) and 11.4% (8.2, 15.7) one and two years later (p=0.005) CONCLUSIONS:: ARF declined significantly following school-based GAS pharyngitis management using oral amoxicillin paralleled by a decline in pharyngeal GAS prevalence.

In addition, websites (n=70) of food and beverage brands most frequently marketed to children through television, sports, magazines and Facebook were included. Marketing techniques and features on those websites were analysed.RESULTS: The extent of food marketing on popular non-food websites was low. A wide range of marketing techniques and features was, however, identified on food brand websites, including advercation (87%), viral marketing (64%), cookies (54%), free downloadable items (43%), promotional characters (39%), designated children’s sections (19%) and advergaming (13%). Most techniques appeared more frequently on websites specifically targeting children and adolescents, than on other websites targeting the general public.CONCLUSION: Compared to traditional media, the internet allows food marketers to use engaging techniques to directly interact with children. While the range of marketing techniques and features identified on food brand websites was extensive, the most popular websites among children and adolescents were non-food related, and the extent of food marketing on those websites was found to be low. Additional assessment of food marketing to children through social and other digital media is recommended. ?

By predisposing both the affected mothers and children to future disease, GDM contributes to an intergenerational cycle of obesity and diabetes. In order to stop this cycle, safe and effective treatments for GDM are required. This study sought to determine the treatment effects of dietary supplementation with myo-inositol (MI) and vitamins B2, B6, B12, and D in a mouse model of GDM (pregnant db/+ dams). In addition, the individual effects of vitamin B2 were examined. Suboptimal B2 increased body weight and fat deposition, decreased GLUT4 adipose tissue expression, and increased expression of inflammatory markers. MI supplementation reduced weight and fat deposition, and reduced expression of inflammatory markers in adipose tissue of mice on suboptimal B2. MI also significantly reduced the hyperleptinemia observed in db/+ mice, when combined with supplemented B2. MI was generally associated with adipose tissue markers of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose uptake, while the combination of vitamins B2, B6, B12, and D was associated with a reduction in adipose inflammatory marker expression. These results suggest that supplementation with MI and vitamin B2 could be beneficial for the treatment/prevention of GDM. ? 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",B12; B2; B6; D; Db/+; Db/db; Gestational diabetes; LepR; Mice; Myo-inositol; Riboflavin,"casein kinase I; chemokine receptor CCR5; cryopyrin; cyanocobalamin; Fas antigen; glucokinase; glucose; glucose 6 phosphatase; glucose transporter 4; inositol; interleukin 1beta; leptin receptor; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (ATP); pyridoxine; riboflavin; toll like receptor 4; tumor necrosis factor receptor 2; vitamin B group; vitamin D; autacoid; inositol; riboflavin; vitamin; vitamin D; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight; controlled study; female; fetus growth; food intake; gene expression; gestational weight gain; glucose transport; gonadal fat; inflammation; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; litter size; mouse; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; perirenal fat; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; progeny; protein expression; retroperitoneal fat; signal transduction; vitamin supplementation; weight reduction; animal; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes, Gestational; dietary supplement; disease model; metabolism; pregnancy; Adipose Tissue; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes, Gestational; Dietary Supplements; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Inflammation Mediators; Inositol; Mice; Pregnancy; Riboflavin; Vitamin D; Vitamins",2-s2.0-85013156342

Fetal state 1F is more likely to occur in maternal supine or right lateral positions. Fetal state 4F is less likely to occur when the woman lies supine or semi-recumbent. Fetal state change is more likely when the woman is supine or semi-recumbent. Fetal heart rate variability is affected by maternal position with variability reduced in supine and semi-recumbent positions. Abstract: Fetal behavioural states (FBS) are measures of fetal wellbeing. In acute hypoxaemia, the human fetus adapts to a lower oxygen consuming state with changes in the cardiotocograph and reduced fetal activity. Recent studies of late gestation stillbirth described the importance of sleep position in the risk of intrauterine death. We designed this study to assess the effects of different maternal positions on FBS in healthy late gestation pregnancies under controlled conditions. Twenty-nine healthy women had continuous fetal ECG recordings under standardized conditions in four randomly allocated positions, left lateral, right lateral, supine and semi-recumbent. Two blinded observers, assigned fetal states in 5?min blocks. Measures of fetal heart rate variability were calculated from ECG beat to beat data. Compared to state 2F, state 4F was less likely to occur when women were semi-recumbent [odds ratio (OR)?=?0.11, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.02, 0.55], and supine (OR?=?0.27, 95% CI 0.07, 1.10). State 1F was more likely on the right (OR?=?2.36, 95% CI 1.11, 5.04) or supine (OR?=?4.99, 95% CI 2.41, 10.43) compared to the left. State change was more likely when the mother was semi-recumbent (OR?=?2.17, 95% CI 1.19, 3.95) or supine (OR?=?2.67, 95% CI 1.46, 4.85). There was a significant association of maternal position to mean fetal heart rate. The measures of heart rate variability (SDNN and RMSSD) were reduced in both semi-recumbent and supine positions. In healthy late gestation pregnancy, maternal position affects FBS and heart rate variability. These effects are likely fetal adaptations to positions which may produce a mild hypoxic stress. ? 2016 The Authors.

While there is high level evidence in adults demonstrating an improvement in the rate of complete recovery of facial nerve function when treated with steroids compared with placebo, similar high level studies on the use of steroids in Bell's palsy in children are not available. The aim of this study is to assess the utility of steroids in Bell's palsy in children in a randomised placebo-controlled trial. Methods/Design: We are conducting a randomised, triple-blinded, placebo controlled trial of the use of prednisolone to improve recovery from Bell's palsy at 1 month. Study sites are 10 hospitals within the Australian and New Zealand PREDICT (Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative) research network. 540 participants will be enrolled. To be eligible patients need to be aged 6 months to < 18 years and present within 72 hours of onset of clinician diagnosed Bell's palsy to one of the participating hospital emergency departments. Patients will be excluded in case of current use of or contraindications to steroids or if there is an alternative diagnosis. Participants will receive either prednisolone 1 mg/kg/day to a maximum of 50 mg/day or taste matched placebo for 10 days. The primary outcome is complete recovery by House-Brackmann scale at 1 month. Secondary outcomes include assessment of recovery using the Sunnybrook scale, the emotional and functional wellbeing of the participants using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory and Child Health Utility 9D Scale, pain using Faces Pain Scale Revised or visual analogue scales, synkinesis using a synkinesis assessment questionnaire and health utilisation costs at 1, 3 and 6 months. Participants will be tracked to 12 months if not recovered earlier. Data analysis will be by intention to treat with primary outcome presented as differences in proportions and an odds ratio adjusted for site and age. Discussion: This large multicenter randomised trial will allow the definitive assessment of the efficacy of prednisolone compared with placebo in the treatment of Bell's palsy in children.

We utilize high-resolution confocal microscopy and custom computational tools to characterize the morphologies of four neuron types in the stomatogastric ganglion (STG) of the crab Cancer borealis. Macroscopic branching patterns and fine cable properties are variable within and across neuron types. We compare these neuronal structures to synthetic minimal spanning neurite trees constrained by a wiring cost equation and find that STG neurons do not adhere to prevailing hypotheses regarding wiring optimization principles.

Diabetic cells formed larger clusters of mitochondria (60% more mitochondria per cluster) and the effective surface-to-volume ratio of these clusters increased by 22.5%.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Oxidative stress leads to the modification of HSPA2 by the lipid aldehyde 4-hydroxynonenal (4HNE) and initiates its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Previous work has revealed a deficiency in HSPA2 protein expression within the spermatozoa of infertile men that have failed fertilization in a clinical setting. While the biological basis of this reduction in HSPA2 remains to be established, we have recently shown that the HSPA2 expressed in the spermatozoa of normozoospermic individuals is highly susceptible to adduction, a form of post-translational modification, by the lipid aldehyde 4HNE that has been causally linked to the degradation of its substrates. This modification of HSPA2 by 4HNE adduction dramatically reduced human sperm-egg interaction in vitro. Moreover, studies in a mouse model offer compelling evidence that the co-chaperone BCL2-associated athanogene 6 (BAG6) plays a key role in regulating the stability of HSPA2 in the testis, by preventing its ubiquitination and subsequent proteolytic degradation. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Dose-dependent studies were used to establish a 4HNE-treatment regime for primary culture(s) of male mouse germ cells. The influence of 4HNE on HSPA2 protein stability was subsequently assessed in treated germ cells. Additionally, sperm lysates from infertile patients with established zona pellucida recognition defects were examined for the presence of 4HNE and ubiquitin adducts. A minimum of three biological replicates were performed to test statistical significance. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Oxidative stress was induced in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids isolated from the mouse testis, as well as a GC-2 cell line, using 50-200 μM 4HNE or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the expression of HSPA2 was monitored via immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting approaches. Using the GC-2 cell line as a model, the ubiquitination and degradation of HSPA2 was assessed using immunoprecipitation techniques and pharmacological inhibition of proteasomal and lysosomal degradation pathways. Finally, the interaction between BAG6 and HSPA2 was examined in response to 4HNE exposure via proximity ligation assays. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: HSPA2 protein levels were significantly reduced compared with controls after 4HNE treatment of round spermatids (P &lt; 0.01) and GC-2 cells (P &lt; 0.001) but not pachytene spermatocytes. Using GC-2 cells as a model, HSPA2 was shown to be both adducted by 4HNE and targeted for ubiquitination in response to cellular oxidative stress. Inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 prevented HSPA2 degradation after 4HNE treatment indicating that the degradation of HSPA2 is likely to occur via a proteasomal pathway. Moreover, our assessment of proteasome activity provided evidence that 4HNE treatment can significantly increase the proteasome activity of GC-2 cells (P &lt; 0.05 versus control). Finally, 4HNE exposure to GC-2 cells resulted in the dissociation of HSPA2 from its regulatory co-chaperone BAG6, a key mediator of HSPA2 stability in male germ cells. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: While these experiments were performed using a mouse germ cell-model system, our analyses of patient sperm lysate imply that these mechanisms are conserved between mouse and human germ cells. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: This study suggests a causative link between non-enzymatic post-translational modifications and the relative levels of HSPA2 in the spermatozoa of a specific sub-class of infertile males. In doing so, this work enhances our understanding of failed sperm-egg recognition and may assist in the development of targeted antioxidant-based approaches for ameliorating the production of cytotoxic lipid aldehydes in the testis in an attempt to prevent this form of infertility.

Average BMI standard deviation score was 3.09 (SD = 0.60, range 1.52-5.34 SDS). Reported median daily activity was 80 minutes (IQR = 88). Although 44% of the cohort met the national recommended screen time of &lt;2 hours per day, the mean screen time was longer at 165 minutes (SD = 135). Accelerometer data (n = 130) showed low physical activity time (median 34 minutes [IQR = 29]). Only 18.5% of the total cohort met national recommended physical activity guidelines of 60 minutes per day. There were minimal ethnic differences. In conclusion, obese children/adolescents in this cohort had low levels of physical activity. The vast majority are not meeting national physical activity recommendations. ?

Internationally, stakeholder involvement in palliative care research and health technology assessment requires development. Stakeholder involvement adds value throughout research (from prioritising topics to disseminating findings). Philosophies and understandings about the best ways to involve stakeholders in research differ internationally. Stakeholder involvement took place in seven countries (England, Germany, Italy, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Norway and Poland). Findings informed a project that developed concepts and methods for health technology assessment and applied these to evaluate models of palliative care service delivery. Aims: To report on stakeholder involvement in the INTEGRATE-HTA project and how issues identified informed project development. Design: Using stakeholder consultation or a qualitative research design, as appropriate locally, stakeholders in seven countries acted as 'advisors' to aid researchers' decision making. Thematic analysis was used to identify key issues across countries. Setting/participants: A total of 132 stakeholders (82 professionals and 50 'lay' people) aged 3/418 participated in individual face-to-face or telephone interviews, consultation meetings or focus groups. Results: Different stakeholder involvement methods were used successfully to identify key issues in palliative care. A total of 23 issues common to three or more countries informed decisions about the intervention and comparator of interest, sub questions and specific assessments within the health technology assessment. Conclusion: Stakeholders, including patients and families undergoing palliative care, can inform project decision making using various involvement methods according to the local context. Researchers should consider local understandings about stakeholder involvement as views of appropriate and feasible methods vary. Methods for stakeholder involvement, especially consultation, need further development. ?

Since that time potential roles for this serine protease inhibitor have been identified in neuronal and non-neuronal systems. Many are linked to inhibition of neuroserpin's principal enzyme target, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), although some have been suggested to involve alternate non-inhibitory mechanisms. This review focuses mainly on the inhibitory roles of neuroserpin and discusses the evidence supporting tPA as the physiological target. While the major sites of neuroserpin expression are neural, endocrine and immune tissues, most progress on characterizing functional roles for neuroserpin have been in the brain. Roles in emotional behaviour, synaptic plasticity and neuroprotection in stroke and excitotoxicity models are discussed. Current knowledge on three neurological diseases associated with neuroserpin mutation or activity, Familial Encephalopathy with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies (FENIB), Alzheimer's disease and brain metastasis is presented.

Methods Four studies (target fasting plasma glucose [FPG] ?100?mg/dL [?5.6?mmol/L]; duration ?24?weeks) were included. Standardised data from 2091 subjects (Gla-100, n?=?1024; NPH insulin, n?=?1067) were analysed. Endpoints included glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and FPG change, glycaemic target achievement, hypoglycaemia, weight change, and insulin dose. Results Mean HbA1c and FPG reductions were similar with Gla-100 and NPH insulin regardless of concomitant OAD (P?=?0.184 and P?=?0.553, respectively) and similar proportions of subjects achieved HbA1c <7.0% (P?=?0.603). There was a trend for more subjects treated with Gla-100 achieving FPG ?100?mg/dL versus NPH insulin (relative risk [RR] 1.09 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97–1.23]; P?=?0.135).

Our automated non-invasive system for computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of prostate cancer segments the prostate on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images (DW-MRI) acquired at different b-values, estimates its apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC), and classifies their descriptors – empirical cumulative distribution functions (CDF) – with a trained deep learning network. To segment the prostate, an evolving geometric (level-set-based) deformable model is guided by a speed function depending on intensity attributes extracted from the DW-MRI with nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). For a more robust evolution, the attributes are fused with a probabilistic shape prior and estimated spatial dependencies between prostate voxels. To preserve continuity, the ADCs of the segmented prostate volume at different b-values are normalized and refined using a generalized Gauss-Markov random field image model. The CDFs of the refined ADCs at different b-values are considered global water diffusion features and used to distinguish between benign and malignant prostates. A deep learning network of stacked non-negativity-constrained auto-encoders (SNCAE) is trained to classify the benign or malignant prostates on the basis of the constructed CDFs. Our experiments on 53 clinical DW-MRI data sets resulted in 92.3% accuracy, 83.3% sensitivity, and 100% specificity, indicating that the proposed CAD system could be used as a reliable non-invasive diagnostic tool. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",CAD; DW-MRI; MGRF; NMF; Prostate cancer,"Computer aided design; Computer aided instruction; Diagnosis; Diffusion; Diseases; Distribution functions; Factorization; Gaussian distribution; Learning systems; Magnetic levitation vehicles; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Markov processes; Matrix algebra; Noninvasive medical procedures; Surface diffusion; Urology; Apparent diffusion coefficient; Computer Aided Diagnosis(CAD); Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance; Empirical cumulative distribution functions; Gauss markov random fields; MGRF; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Prostate cancers; Computer aided diagnosis; Article; cancer diagnosis; diagnostic accuracy; diffusion weighted imaging; human; human tissue; image segmentation; k nearest neighbor; male; multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; oncological parameters; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostate volume; random forest; sensitivity and specificity; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; early cancer diagnosis; evaluation study; machine learning; pathology; procedures; prostate tumor; receiver operating characteristic; reproducibility; Algorithms; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Machine Learning; Male; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Prostatic Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-85008152019

Design: Three longitudinal, population-based cohort studies. Setting: Newcastle-upon-Tyne, United Kingdom; Leiden, the Netherlands; and Lakes and Bay of Plenty District Health Board areas, New Zealand. Participants: Newcastle 85+ Study participants (n = 616), Leiden 85-plus Study participants (n = 444), and Life and Living in Advanced Age, a Cohort Study in New Zealand (LiLACS NZ Study) participants (n = 396). Measurements: FSRP, CAIDE risk score, oxi-inflammatory load, FSRP incorporating oxi-inflammatory load, and CAIDE risk score incorporating oxi-inflammatory load. Oxi-inflammatory load could be calculated only in the Newcastle 85+ and the Leiden 85-plus studies. Measures of global cognitive function were available for all three data sets. Domain-specific measures were available for the Newcastle 85+ and the Leiden 85-plus studies. Results: Meta-analysis of pooled results showed greater risk of incident global cognitive impairment with higher FSRP (hazard ratio (HR) = 1.46, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.08–1.98), CAIDE (HR = 1.53, 95% CI = 1.09–2.14), and oxi-inflammatory load (HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.04–2.88) scores.

Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, we identified observational and interventional studies reporting associations between several different sexual behaviours and OPC or OCC. Study quality was assessed independently by two reviewers using a validated scoring system. Results: From 513 papers identified, 21, reporting on 20 studies, fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two cohort studies were rated as moderate quality. The 18 case–control studies were rated as weak; nine comparing people with OPC or OCC to people without cancer, eight comparing HPV-positive to HPV-negative cancer patients and one comparing OPCs to other head and neck cancers. One study was a pooled analysis of seven of the included studies with some additional information. Twelve sexual behaviours were assessed and 69 associations reported. The studies differed in the comparisons made, the sexual behaviours assessed, and how these were reported and categorized, so no quantitative meta-analyses were appropriate. Most studies combined OPC and OCC. Several significantly increased risks were seen with a high number of lifetime sexual partners (nine studies) and with the practice of oral sex (five studies), although two studies found a significant negative association with OCC and ever performing oral sex. Two cohort studies of men and women in homosexual relationships found increases in oral cancer risk, and a cohort study of men married to women who had a history of cervical cancer also showed an increased risk of oral cancers. Results for other sexual behaviours were limited and inconsistent, and these included the following: younger age at first sexual intercourse, number of lifetime oral sex partners, the practice of oral–anal sex, the number of oral–anal sex partners, and ever performing anal sex. Only one study assessed casual sex, never or rare use of a condom and having a sexual partner with a history of genital warts, finding significant associations in the two former behaviours. Conclusion: The current evidence for sexual behaviours being risk factors for oral and oropharyngeal cancer is limited and inconsistent. Evidence suggests that the number of sexual partners and performing oral sex are associated with a greater risk. Furthermore men whose partners have had cervical cancer may have an increased risk. More studies looking at OPC specifically will be useful to determine whether these behaviours are subsite-selective. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Methods: Randomized studies and reviews published in the English language from July 2006 (end date of last review) to March 2016, assessing analgesic, anaesthetic, and operative interventions pertaining to excisional haemorrhoidectomy in adults, and reporting pain scores, were retrieved from the EMBASE and MEDLINE databases. Results: An additional 464 studies were identified of which 74 met the inclusion criteria. There were 48 randomized controlled trials and 26 reviews. Quantitative analyses were not performed, as there were limited numbers of trials with a sufficiently homogeneous design. Conclusion: Pudendal nerve block, with or without general anaesthesia, is recommended for all patients undergoing haemorrhoidal surgery. Either closed haemorrhoidectomy, or open haemorrhoidectomy with electrocoagulation of the pedicle is recommended as the primary procedure. Combinations of analgesics (paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and opioids), topical lignocaine and glyceryl trinitrate, laxatives, and oral metronidazole are recommended post-operatively. The recommendations are largely based on single intervention, not multimodal intervention, studies. ? 2016, Soci?t?

Design Data on the current level of implementation of food environment policies were assessed independently using the adapted Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI) by two groups of actors. Concrete actions were proposed for Thai Government. A joint meeting between both groups was subsequently held to reach consensus on priority actions. Setting Thailand. Subjects Thirty state actors and twenty-seven non-state actors. Results Level of policy implementation varied across different domains and actor groups. State actors rated implementation levels higher than non-state actors. Both state and non-state actors rated level of implementation of monitoring of BMI highest. Level of implementation of policies promoting in-store availability of healthy foods and policies increasing tax on unhealthy foods were rated lowest by state and non-state actors, respectively. Both groups reached consensus on eleven priority actions for implementation, focusing on food provision in public-sector settings, food composition, food promotion, leadership, monitoring and intelligence, and food trade. Conclusions Although the implementation gaps identified and priority actions proposed varied between state and non-state actors, both groups achieved consensus on a comprehensive food policy package to be implemented by the Thai Government to improve the healthiness of food environments.

Gestational diabetes, glucose intolerance first recognised during pregnancy, usually resolves after birth and is associated with short- and long-term complications for the mother and her infant. Treatment options can include oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies. Objectives: To evaluate the effects of oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies for treating women with GDM. Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register (14 May 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, WHO ICTRP (14 May 2016) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials assessing the effects of oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies for treating pregnant women with GDM. We included studies comparing oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies with 1) placebo/standard care, 2) another oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy, 3) combined oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies. Trials using insulin as the comparator were excluded as they are the subject of a separate Cochrane systematic review. Women with pre-existing type 1 or type 2 diabetes were excluded. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and trial quality. Two review authors independently extracted data and data were checked for accuracy. Main results: We included 11 studies (19 publications) (1487 women and their babies). Eight studies had data that could be included in meta-analyses. Studies were conducted in Brazil, India, Israel, UK, South Africa and USA. The studies varied in diagnostic criteria and treatment targets for glycaemic control for GDM. The overall risk of bias was 'unclear' due to inadequate reporting of methodology. Using GRADE the quality of the evidence ranged from moderate to very low quality. Evidence was downgraded for risk of bias (reporting bias, lack of blinding), inconsistency, indirectness, imprecision and for oral anti-diabetic therapy versus placebo for generalisability. Oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies versus placebo/standard care There was no evidence of a difference between glibenclamide and placebo groups for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (risk ratio (RR) 1.24, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.81 to 1.90; one study, 375 women, very low-quality evidence), birth by caesarean section (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.34; one study, 375 women, very low-quality evidence), perineal trauma (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.06 to 15.62; one study, 375 women, very low-quality evidence) or induction of labour (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.76; one study, 375 women; very low-quality evidence). No data were reported for development of type 2 diabetes or other pre-specified GRADE maternal outcomes (return to pre-pregnancy weight, postnatal depression). For the infant, there was no evidence of a difference in the risk of being born large-for-gestational age (LGA) between infants whose mothers had been treated with glibenclamide and those in the placebo group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.58; one study, 375, low-quality evidence). No data were reported for other infant primary or GRADE outcomes (perinatal mortality, death or serious morbidity composite, neurosensory disability in later childhood, neonatal hypoglycaemia, adiposity, diabetes). Metformin versus glibenclamide There was no evidence of a difference between metformin- and glibenclamide-treated groups for the risk of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.30; three studies, 508 women, moderate-quality evidence), birth by caesarean section (average RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.20; 95% CI 0.83 to 1.72, four studies, 554 women, I2 = 61%, Tau2 = 0.07 low-quality evidence), induction of labour (0.81, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.07; one study, 159 women; low-quality evidence) or perineal trauma (RR 1.67, 95% CI 0.22 to 12.52; two studies, 158 women; low-quality evidence). No data were reported for development of type 2 diabetes or other pre-specified GRADE maternal outcomes (return to pre-pregnancy weight, postnatal depression). For the infant there was no evidence of a difference between the metformin- and glibenclamide-exposed groups for the risk of being born LGA (average RR 0.67, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.83; two studies, 246 infants, I2 = 54%, Tau2 = 0.30 low-quality evidence). Metformin was associated with a decrease in a death or serious morbidity composite (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.94; one study, 159 infants, low-quality evidence). There was no clear difference between groups for neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.42 to 1.77; four studies, 554 infants, low-quality evidence) or perinatal mortality (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.06 to 14.55, two studies, 359 infants). No data were reported for neurosensory disability in later childhood or for adiposity or diabetes. Glibenclamide versus acarbose There was no evidence of a difference between glibenclamide and acarbose from one study (43 women) for any of their maternal or infant primary outcomes (caesarean section, RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.70; low-quality evidence; perinatal mortality - no events; low-quality evidence; LGA, RR 2.38, 95% CI 0.54 to 10.46; low-quality evidence). There was no evidence of a difference between glibenclamide and acarbose for neonatal hypoglycaemia (RR 6.33, 95% CI 0.87 to 46.32; low-quality evidence). There were no data reported for other pre-specified GRADE or primary maternal outcomes (hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, development of type 2 diabetes, perineal trauma, return to pre-pregnancy weight, postnatal depression, induction of labour) or neonatal outcomes (death or serious morbidity composite, adiposity or diabetes). Authors' conclusions: There were insufficient data comparing oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapies with placebo/standard care (lifestyle advice) to inform clinical practice. There was insufficient high-quality evidence to be able to draw any meaningful conclusions as to the benefits of one oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy over another due to limited reporting of data for the primary and secondary outcomes in this review. Short- and long-term clinical outcomes for this review were inadequately reported or not reported. Current choice of oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy appears to be based on clinical preference, availability and national clinical practice guidelines. The benefits and potential harms of one oral anti-diabetic pharmacological therapy compared with another, or compared with placebo/standard care remains unclear and requires further research. Future trials should attempt to report on the core outcomes suggested in this review, in particular long-term outcomes for the woman and the infant that have been poorly reported to date, women's experiences and cost benefit. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"acarbose; biological marker; glibenclamide; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; placebo; acarbose; antidiabetic agent; glibenclamide; metformin; tolbutamide; birth injury; birth weight; cesarean section; disability; drug therapy; female; fetus outcome; fracture; gestational age; glycemic control; health care quality; health care utilization; health service; human; hyperbilirubinemia; hypertension; hypoglycemia; labor induction; large for gestational age; macrosomia; maternal disease; nerve paralysis; newborn death; newborn disease; newborn intensive care; newborn jaundice; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; parameters concerning the fetus, newborn and pregnancy; perinatal death; perineum injury; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnant woman; premature labor; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); respiratory distress syndrome; Review; sensory dysfunction; shoulder dystocia; small for date infant; stillbirth; systematic review; time; weight gain; chemically induced; Diabetes, Gestational; hypoglycemia; meta analysis; oral drug administration; Acarbose; Administration, Oral; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Glyburide; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Metformin; Pregnancy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tolbutamide",2-s2.0-85011019638

These numbers might even be higher for high-risk women such as those with polycystic ovaries or a high oocyte yield from ovum pickup. Objectives: The objective of this overview is to identify and summarise all evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on interventions for prevention or treatment of moderate, severe and overall OHSS in couples with subfertility who are undergoing ART cycles. Methods: Published Cochrane systematic reviews reporting on moderate, severe or overall OHSS as an outcome in ART cycles were eligible for inclusion in this overview. We also identified Cochrane submitted protocols and title registrations for future inclusion in the overview. The evidence is current to 12 December 2016. We identified reviews, protocols and titles by searching the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Database of Systematic Reviews and Archie (the Cochrane information management system) in July 2016 on the effectiveness of interventions for outcomes of moderate, severe and overall OHSS. We undertook in duplicate selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and quality assessment. We used the AMSTAR (Assessing the Methodological Quality of Systematic Reviews) tool to assess the quality of included reviews, and we used GRADE methods to assess the quality of the evidence for each outcome. We summarised the characteristics of included reviews in the text and in additional tables. Main results: We included a total of 27 reviews in this overview. The reviews were generally of high quality according to AMSTAR ratings, and included studies provided evidence that ranged from very low to high in quality. Ten reviews had not been updated in the past three years. Seven reviews described interventions that provided a beneficial effect in reducing OHSS rates, and we categorised one additional review as 'promising'. Of the effective interventions, all except one had no detrimental effect on pregnancy outcomes. Evidence of at least moderate quality indicates that clinicians should consider the following interventions in ART cycles to reduce OHSS rates. ? Metformin treatment before and during an ART cycle for women with PCOS (moderate-quality evidence). ? Gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol in ART cycles (moderate-quality evidence). ? GnRH agonist (GnRHa) trigger in donor oocyte or 'freeze-all' programmes (moderate-quality evidence). Evidence of low or very low quality suggests that clinicians should consider the following interventions in ART cycles to reduce OHSS rates. ? Clomiphene citrate for controlled ovarian stimulation in ART cycles (low-quality evidence). ? Cabergoline around the time of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) administration or oocyte pickup in ART cycles (low-quality evidence). ? Intravenous fluids (plasma expanders) around the time of hCG administration or oocyte pickup in ART cycles (very low-quality evidence). ? Progesterone for luteal phase support in ART cycles (low-quality evidence). ? Coasting (withholding gonadotrophins) - a promising intervention that needs to be researched further for reduction of OHSS. On the basis of this overview, we must conclude that evidence is currently insufficient to support the widespread practice of embryo cryopreservation. Authors' conclusions: Currently, 27 reviews in the Cochrane Library were conducted to report on or to try to report on OHSS in ART cycles. We identified four review protocols but no new registered titles that can potentially be included in this overview in the future. This overview provides the most up-to-date evidence on prevention of OHSS in ART cycles from all currently published Cochrane reviews on ART. Clinicians can use the evidence summarised in this overview to choose the best treatment regimen for individual patients - a regimen that not only reduces the chance of developing OHSS but does not compromise other outcomes such as pregnancy or live birth rate. Review results, however, are limited by the lack of recent primary studies or updated reviews. Furthermore, this overview can be used by policymakers in developing local and regional protocols or guidelines and can reveal knowledge gaps for future research. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"adjuvant therapy; embryo transfer; female; human; in vitro fertilization; infertility therapy; luteal phase; outcome assessment; ovary hyperstimulation; ovulation; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; stimulation; systematic review; adverse effects; agonists; infertility therapy; literature; meta analysis; Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome; pregnancy; cabergoline; ergoline derivative; gonadorelin; metformin; progesterone; Ergolines; Female; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Humans; Metformin; Ovarian Hyperstimulation Syndrome; Pregnancy; Progesterone; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Review Literature as Topic",2-s2.0-85011093306

In this study, human liver samples were collected from hepatitis C-, alcoholic-, and cholestatic-associated fibrotic and healthy individuals. Two mouse models of liver fibrosis were established: Bile duct ligation and carbon tetrachloride injection. We constructed adenovirus vectors to overexpress VHL, normoxia-active HIF-α, and lentiviral vectors to silence HIF-α. The results showed that liver sections from fibrosis patients had a lower level of VHL and higher levels of HIF-1α and HIF-2α compared with healthy sections, a finding which was confirmed in mice. Overexpression of VHL attenuated liver fibrosis, downregulated fibrogenic genes, and inhibited liver inflammation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis. Overexpression of VHL was more successful at inhibiting fibrosis compared with silencing HIF-1α plus HIF-2α. Normoxia-active HIF-1α or HIF-2α prevented the inhibitory effect of VHL on liver fibrosis, indicating that attenuating fibrosis via VHL is HIF-1α- and HIF-2α-dependent to some extent. In addition, overexpression of VHL inhibited mouse hepatic stellate cells activation and proliferation and promoted apoptosis. Taken together, VHL may be considered a new target to inhibit liver fibrosis. ?

Previous studies have used activation of the target leg to facilitate MEPs in the LL but this may not be possible after stroke due to hemiplegia. The dominance of the target limb may also be important, however the neurophysiological effects of LL dominance are not known. We investigated whether voluntary activation of the non-target leg combined with optimal TMS coil orientation increases corticomotor excitability in healthy adults, and whether limb dominance influences these results. TMS was delivered to induce a posterior-anterior (PA) and a medial-lateral (ML) cortical current in 22 healthy adults. MEPs were recorded in tibialis anterior (TA) with the participant at rest and when activating the non-target leg. We found that non-target leg activation increased corticomotor excitability in the target leg (reduced rest motor threshold (RMT) and MEP latency, and increased recruitment curve slope). ML cortical current also reduced RMT and MEP latency. The degree of footedness correlated with the degree of RMT asymmetry, with a PA but not ML cortical current direction. In summary, cross-facilitation by activating the non-target leg in a task requiring postural stabilisation and inducing ML current increase corticomotor excitability regardless of limb dominance. This protocol may have practical application in testing CST integrity after stroke when paretic limb thresholds are high, by increasing the likelihood of eliciting a MEP. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Corticomotor excitability; Footedness; Lower limb; Stroke; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,"adult; Article; cerebrovascular accident; facilitation; hemispheric dominance; human; human experiment; leg movement; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; nerve cell excitability; normal human; priority journal; pyramidal tract; tibialis anterior muscle; transcranial magnetic stimulation; analysis of variance; devices; electromyography; female; hemispheric dominance; lower limb; male; middle aged; motor cortex; physiology; procedures; rest; statistical model; stroke rehabilitation; time factor; transcranial magnetic stimulation; young adult; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Electromyography; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Linear Models; Lower Extremity; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Cortex; Rest; Stroke Rehabilitation; Time Factors; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84995735664

METHODS: 15,822 participants responded to the 2014/15 New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (NZAVS) survey. This survey included an item on people’s attitudes towards euthanasia, and information on their demographic and psychological characteristics. RESULTS: The majority of New Zealanders expressed support for euthanasia, which was assessed by asking “Suppose a person has a painful incurable disease. Do you think that doctors should be allowed by law to end the patient’s life if the patient requests it?” Non-religious, liberal, younger, employed, non-parents and those living in rural areas were more supportive. Those of Pacific or Asian ethnicity, with lower income and higher deprivation, education and socio-economic status were less supportive. Furthermore, those high on extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism showed more support, while those high on agreeableness and honesty-humility exhibited less support. CONCLUSION: There is strong public support for euthanasia when people are asked whether doctors should be allowed by law to end the life of a patient with a painful incurable disease upon their request. There are reliable demographic and personality dierences in support for euthanasia. ?

Cytotoxicity was evaluated in an nfsB-transfected EMT6 mouse mammary carcinoma cell line. Cellular uptake of liposomes was evaluated by both high performance liquid chromatography and flow cytometry. Intracellular trafficking was visualised by confocal microscopy. High drug loading (7.0?±?0.2% w/w) was achieved after systematic optimization of drug loading conditions. pPSL-SN25860 demonstrated a 21 and 24- fold increase in antiproliferative potency compared to nPSL-SN25860 and free drug, respectively. Cells treated with pPSL had a 1.6–2.5- fold increase in intracellular drug concentration compared to nPSL. This trend was consistent with flow cytometry results. Cells treated with chlorpromazine demonstrated reduced uptake of both nPSL (40%) and pPSL (46%), indicating clathrin-mediated endocytosis was the major pathway. Confocal microscopy showed that pPSL had not only undergone faster and greater endocytosis than nPSL but was also homogeneously distributed in the cytosol and nuclei suggesting endosome escape, in contrast to nPSL. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Active loading; Endosome escape; Gene-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy; pH-sensitive liposomes,"3 [5 [bis(2 bromoethyl)amino] 2,4 dinitrobenzamido]propanoic acid; chlorpromazine; clathrin; cytotoxic agent; liposome; macrogol 2000; prodrug; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; benzamide derivative; chlormethine derivative; liposome; macrogol derivative; prodrug; animal cell; antiproliferative activity; Article; breast cancer cell line; cancer cell; concentration (parameters); confocal microscopy; controlled study; cryoelectron microscopy; cytosol; dispersity; drug cytotoxicity; drug formulation; drug potency; drug release; drug targeting; endocytosis; endosome; flow cytometry; high performance liquid chromatography; internalization; intracellular transport; liposomal delivery; mouse; nonhuman; particle size; pH; priority journal; temperature; transmission electron microscopy; zeta potential; animal; cell proliferation; chemistry; comparative study; drug delivery system; drug effects; female; genetic transfection; Mammary Neoplasms, Animal; metabolism; pathology; pH; procedures; solubility; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Benzamides; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Drug Delivery Systems; Endosomes; Female; Flow Cytometry; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Liposomes; Mammary Neoplasms, Animal; Mice; Microscopy, Confocal; Nitrogen Mustard Compounds; Polyethylene Glycols; Prodrugs; Solubility; Transfection",2-s2.0-84997646416

Currently, the drugs used to treat T2D improve hyperglycemic symptom of the disease but the underlying mechanism causing the high blood glucose levels have not been fully resolved. Recently published data showed that salt form of niclosamide improved glucose metabolism in high fat fed mice via mitochondrial uncoupling. However, based on our previous work we hypothesised that niclosamide might also improve glucose metabolism via inhibition of the glucagon signalling in liver in vivo. In this study, mice were fed either a chow or high fat diet containing two different formulations of niclosamide (niclosamide ethanolamine salt - NENS or niclosamide - Nic) for 10 weeks. We identified both forms of niclosamide significantly improved whole body glucose metabolism without altering total body weight or body composition, energy expenditure or insulin secretion or sensitivity. Our study provides evidence that inhibition of the glucagon signalling pathway contributes to the beneficial effects of niclosamide (NENS or Nic) on whole body glucose metabolism. In conclusion, our results suggest that the niclosamide could be a useful adjunctive therapeutic strategy to treat T2D, as hepatic glucose output is elevated in people with T2D and current drugs do not redress this adequately. ?

We assessed this schedule in New Zealand (NZ), a setting with historically high rates of pertussis disease, and low but recently improved immunisation coverage. We further evaluated protection following the preschool-age booster dose. Methods We performed a nested case-control study using national-level healthcare data. Hospitalised and non-hospitalised pertussis was detected among children 6?weeks to 7?years of age between January 2006 and December 2013. The NZ National Immunisation Register provided vaccination status for cases and controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate dose-specific VE with duration of immunity examined by stratifying VE into ages aligned with the immunisation schedule. Results VE against pertussis hospitalisation was 93% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 87, 96) following three doses among infants aged 5–11?months who received three compared to zero doses. This protection was sustained through children's fourth birthdays (VE???91%). VE against non-hospitalised pertussis was also sustained after three doses, from 86% (95% CI: 80, 90) among 5–11?month olds to 84% (95% CI: 80, 88) among 3-year-olds. Following the first booster dose at 4?years of age, the protective VE of 93% (95% CI: 90, 95) among 4-year-olds continued through 7?years of age (VE???91%). Conclusions We found a high level of protection with no reduction in VE following both the primary course and the first booster dose. These findings support a 3-dose primary course of acellular vaccine with no booster dose until 4?years of age. ? 2016 The Authors",Effectiveness; Immunization; Pertussis; Vaccine; Waning,"diphtheria pertussis poliomyelitis tetanus Haemophilus influenzae type b hepatitis B vaccine; acellular vaccine; pertussis vaccine; age specific care; Article; case control study; child; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; female; hospitalization; human; immunization; incidence; infant; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; pertussis; preschool child; priority journal; protection; register; vaccination; age; immunology; pertussis; treatment outcome; Age Factors; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Male; New Zealand; Pertussis Vaccine; Treatment Outcome; Vaccines, Acellular; Whooping Cough",2-s2.0-84999737921

An integrative literature review,2017,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978493533&doi=10.1080%2f09699260.2016.1189483&partnerID=40&md5=3e558bc13faa45cc883f0496363d1d21,"Background: Public health and palliative care are both broad disciplines with blurred boundaries. There is growing support for an alignment of palliative care to public health. Given the novel nature of this alignment and the ambiguity of the parent definitions, there is an understandable lack of clarity around this merged model. Methods: The aim of this study is to describe the theoretical features of the public health approach to palliative care as articulated in the current research literature. An integrative literature review was conducted using systematic methods to identify qualitative and quantitative studies that expressly support such an approach. Results: The search identified 18 studies. A thematic synthesis of these studies identified three different paradigms of a public health approach to palliative care within the current empirical research. These were defined as a health-promotion approach focussed on empowerment at community level, a World Health Organisation approach which focussed on systems at country level, and a population-based approach which typically viewed palliative care issues from an epidemiological perspective. Conclusion: This review highlights that the public health approach to palliative care is understood in various ways. It is important that future research studies clarify which public health approach they are referring to. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",End of life; Frameworks; Health promotion; Models; Palliative care; Public health; Theory,empirical research; empowerment; health promotion; palliative therapy; public health; quantitative study; synthesis; theoretical model; world health organization,2-s2.0-84978493533

The pulls of casual sex are often depicted as sexual gratification and the drawbacks relayed in terms of physical risk, for example, sexually transmitted infections (STIs)/human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission. Most of the research in this area has largely focused on undergraduate university students or “emerging adults” in North America, using primarily quantitative methodologies. We build on this work and a small but growing amount of qualitative research to unpack the complex psychoemotional and experiential dimensions of casual sex. We report on a critical thematic analysis of interviews with 30 ethnically diverse women and men (aged 18 to 46) in New Zealand about their experiences of heterosexual casual sex to achieve two things. First, we demonstrate the complexity with which women and men discussed their casual sex experiences, highlighting how the practice was varied, contradictory, and multifaceted, and played in a localized way during the conversation. Second, we illustrate how this talk was governed by contemporary Western discourses of intimate relationships and the shape of (gendered) heterosexuality. We conclude that casual sex research must always consider the broader sociocultural context, as well as the interpersonal context, within which any sexual relating is situated. Copyright ?

Each miRNA controls the expression of multiple messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and their dysregulation has been implicated in multiple cancer phenotypes. While some miRNAs are upregulated, global downregulation of miRNA expression is often the rule in cancer. A multitude of potential mechanisms drive aberrant miRNA expression in cancer; miRNA coding regions can harbour genomic defects including mutations, amplifications or deletions, and some miRNAs are broadly repressed by transcription factors such as Myc or have epigenetic modifications to their promoter regions such as hypermethylation of CpG islands. Additionally, the suppression of components of the miRNA processing machinery has been shown to reduce mature miRNA expression and contribute to the malignant phenotype. Understanding the mechanisms driving miRNA downregulation is important in uncovering the critical and complex role of miRNAs in cancer biology. This review will outline the multiple mechanisms by which cancer cells suppress miRNA expression. Copyright?

A large proportion of young people in New Zealand (NZ) are affected by depression, suicidal ideation and other mental health concerns, but the majority do not access help. For NZ indigenous Maori, the burden of morbidity and mortality associated with mental health is considerably higher. Targeted screening for risky behaviours and mental health concerns among youth in primary care settings can lead to early detection and intervention for emerging or current mental health and psychosocial issues. Opportunistic screening for youth in primary care settings is not routinely undertaken due to competing time demands, lack of context-specific screening tools and insufficient knowledge about suitable interventions. Strategies are required to improve screening that are acceptable and appropriate for the primary care environment. This article outlines the development, utilisation and ongoing evaluation and implementation strategies for YouthCHAT. YouthCHAT: YouthCHAT is a rapid, electronic, self-report screening tool that assesses risky health-related behaviours and mental health concerns, with a 'help question' that enables youth to prioritise areas they want help with. The young person can complete YouthCHAT in the waiting room prior to consultation, and after completion, the clinician can immediately access a summary report which includes algorithms for stepped-care interventions using a strength-based approach. A project to scale up the implementation is about to commence, using a co-design participatory research approach to assess acceptability and feasibility with successive roll-out to clinics. In addition, a counterbalanced randomised trial of YouthCHAT versus clinician-administered assessment is underway at a NZ high school. Conclusion: Opportunistic screening for mental health concerns and other risky health behaviours during adolescence can yield significant health gains and prevent unnecessary morbidity and mortality. The systematic approaches to screening and provision of algorithms for stepped-care intervention will assist in delivering time efficient, early, more comprehensive interventions for youth with mental health concerns and other health compromising behaviours. The early detection of concerns and facilitation to evidence-based interventions has the potential to lead to improved health outcomes, particularly for under-served indigenous populations. ?

Psychological stress is a ubiquitous facet of life, and although stress affects us all at some point, prolonged or unmanageable stress may become harmful for some individuals, negatively impacting on their health, including fertility. For instance, women who struggle to conceive are twice as likely to suffer from emotional distress than fertile women. Assisted reproductive technology treatments place an additional physical, emotional, and financial burden of stress, particularly on women, who are often exposed to invasive techniques associated with treatment. Stress-reduction interventions can reduce negative affect and in some cases to improve in vitro fertilization outcomes. Although it has been well-established that stress negatively affects fertility in animal models, human research remains inconsistent due to individual differences and methodological flaws. Attempts to isolate single causal links between stress and infertility have not yet been successful due to their multifaceted etiologies. In this review, we will discuss the current literature in the field of stress-induced reproductive dysfunction based on animal and human models, and introduce a recently unexplored link between stress and infertility, the gut-derived hormone, ghrelin. We also present evidence from recent seminal studies demonstrating that ghrelin has a principal role in the stress response and reward processing, as well as in regulating reproductive function, and that these roles are tightly interlinked. Collectively, these data support the hypothesis that stress may negatively impact upon fertility at least in part by stimulating a dysregulation in ghrelin signaling. ? 2017 Endocrine Society.",,"4 aminobutyric acid; corticotropin releasing factor; ghrelin; ghrelin receptor; glucocorticoid; gonadorelin; gonadotropin; kisspeptin; ghrelin; gonadorelin; Article; connectome; energy; fertilization; fetus development; hormonal regulation; human; human cell; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis gonad system; infertility; mood disorder; nonhuman; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy disorder; priority journal; puberty; reward; signal transduction; stress; testis; adrenal gland; animal; complication; female; hypothalamus hypophysis system; infertility; infertility therapy; male; mental stress; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; reproductive health; Adrenal Glands; Animals; Female; Fetal Development; Ghrelin; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Humans; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Infertility; Male; Reproductive Health; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Signal Transduction; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-85047727691

A better understanding of the features of the built environment that encourage PA or ST is therefore of critical importance to promote health and wellbeing in adolescents. The aim of this study was to estimate the associations of GIS-determined and perceived walkability components in individual residential buffer zones with accelerometer-assessed moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and ST in adolescents. Methods: The Built Environment in Adolescent New Zealanders (BEANZ) study was conducted in two cities (Auckland and Wellington) during the 2013-2014 academic school years. The exposure measures were subjective and objective environmental indices of activity-friendliness using four residential buffers. Road network buffers were calculated around participant’s residential addresses using the sausage buffer approach at 250 m, 500 m, 1 km, and 2 km scales. A 25 m radius was used for the buffers. Data were analysed using Generalized Additive Mixed Models in R. Results: Data were analysed from 524 participants (15.78 ± 1.62 years; 45% male). Participants accumulated ~114 min/ day of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and ~354 min/day of ST during accelerometer wear-time (~828 min/day). The estimated difference in MVPA between participants with the 1st and 3rd quartiles observed values on the composite subjective environmental index of activity-friendliness (perceived land use mix - diversity, street connectivity and aesthetics) was equivalent to ~8 min/day (~56 MVPA min/week) and for the objective environmental index of activity-friendliness (gross residential density and number of parks within 2 km distance from home) was ~6 min of MVPA/day (~45 MVPA min/week). When both indices were entered in a main-effect model, both indices remained significantly correlated with MVPA with sex as a moderator. The predicted difference in sedentary time between those with the minimum and maximum observed values on the subjective index of non-sedentariness was ~20 min/day. Conclusions: The combined assessment of the main effects of subjective and objective indices of activity-friendliness on NZ adolescents’ PA and ST showed positive relationships with MVPA for the subjective index only. The subjective index was a significant correlate of PA in both girls and boys, while the objective index was significant only in boys when sex was entered as a moderator. Further research is warranted to understand the relationships of ST with the built environment. ?

Induced sputum (IS) may provide diagnostic information about the etiology of pneumonia. The safety of this procedure across a heterogeneous population with severe pneumonia in low- and middle-income countries has not been described. Methods. IS specimens were obtained as part a 7-country study of the etiology of severe and very severe pneumonia in hospitalized children <5 years of age. Rigorous clinical monitoring was done before, during, and after the procedure to record oxygen requirement, oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, consciousness level, and other evidence of clinical deterioration. Criteria for IS contraindications were predefined and serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported to ethics committees and a central safety monitor. Results. A total of 4653 IS procedures were done among 3802 children. Thirteen SAEs were reported in relation to collection of IS, or 0.34% of children with at least 1 IS specimen collected (95% confidence interval, 0.15%-0.53%). A drop in oxygen saturation that required supplemental oxygen was the most common SAE. One child died after feeding was reinitiated 2 hours after undergoing sputum induction; this death was categorized as ""possibly related"" to the procedure. Conclusions. The overall frequency of SAEs was very low, and the nature of most SAEs was manageable, demonstrating a lowrisk safety profile for IS collection even among severely ill children in low-income-country settings. Healthcare providers should monitor oxygen saturation and requirements during and after IS collection, and assess patients prior to reinitiating feeding after the IS procedure, to ensure patient safety. ?

Sputum microscopy and culture are commonly used for diagnosing the cause of pneumonia in adults but are rarely performed in children due to difficulties in obtaining specimens. Induced sputum is occasionally used to investigate lower respiratory infections in children but has not been widely used in pneumonia etiology studies. Methods. We evaluated the diagnostic utility of induced sputum microscopy and culture in patients enrolled in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study, a large study of community-acquired pneumonia in children aged 1-59 months. Comparisons were made between induced sputum samples from hospitalized children with radiographically confirmed pneumonia and children categorized as nonpneumonia (due to the absence of prespecified clinical and laboratory signs and absence of infiltrate on chest radiograph). Results. One induced sputum sample was available for analysis from 3772 (89.1%) of 4232 suspected pneumonia cases enrolled in PERCH. Of these, sputum from 2608 (69.1%) met the quality criterion of <10 squamous epithelial cells per low-power field, and 1162 (44.6%) had radiographic pneumonia. Induced sputum microscopy and culture results were not associated with radiographic pneumonia, regardless of prior antibiotic use, stratification by specific bacteria, or interpretative criteria used. Conclusions. The findings of this study do not support the culture of induced sputum specimens as a diagnostic tool for pneumonia in young children as part of routine clinical practice. ?

Herein we argue that selecting controls regardless of respiratory symptoms provides the least biased estimates of pneumonia etiology. We review reasons investigators may choose to exclude controls with respiratory symptoms in light of epidemiologic principles of control selection and present data from the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study where relevant to assess their validity. We conclude that exclusion of controls with respiratory symptoms will result in biased estimates of etiology. Randomly selected community controls, with or without respiratory symptoms, as long as they do not meet the criteria for case-defining pneumonia, are most representative of the general population from which cases arose and the least subject to selection bias. ?

Variable adherence to standardized case definitions, clinical procedures, specimen collection techniques, and laboratory methods has complicated the interpretation of previous multicenter pneumonia etiology studies. To circumvent these problems, a program of clinical standardization was embedded in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) study. Methods. Between March 201and August 2013, standardized training on the PERCH case definition, clinical procedures, and collection of laboratory specimens was delivered to 33clinical staff at study sites in countries (The Gambia, Kenya, Mali, South Africa, Zambia, Thailand, and Bangladesh), through 3on-site courses and a training website. Staff competency was assessed throughout 2months of enrollment with multiple-choice question (MCQ) examinations, a video quiz, and checklist evaluations of practical skills. Results. MCQ evaluation was confined to 15clinical staff members who enrolled PERCH cases and controls, with scores obtained for >86% of eligible staff at each time-point. Median scores after baseline training were =80%, and improved by 1percentage points with refresher training, with no significant intersite differences. Percentage agreement with the clinical trainer on the presence or absence of clinical signs on video clips was high (=89%), with interobserver concordance being substantial to high (ACstatistic, 0.62-0.82) for of signs assessed. Staff attained median scores of >90% in checklist evaluations of practical skills. Conclusions. Satisfactory clinical standardization was achieved within and across all PERCH sites, providing reassurance that any etiological or clinical differences observed across the study sites are true differences, and not attributable to differences in application of the clinical case definition, interpretation of clinical signs, or in techniques used for clinical measurements or specimen collection. ?

Sputum examination can be useful in diagnosing the cause of pneumonia in adults but is less well established in children. We sought to assess the diagnostic utility of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for detection of respiratory viruses and bacteria in induced sputum (IS) specimens from children hospitalized with severe or very severe pneumonia. Methods. Among children aged 1-59 months, we compared organism detection by multiplex PCR in IS and nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) specimens. To assess whether organism presence or density in IS specimens was associated with chest radiographic evidence of pneumonia (radiographic pneumonia), we compared prevalence and density in IS specimens from children with radiographic pneumonia and children with suspected pneumonia but without chest radiographic changes or clinical or laboratory findings suggestive of pneumonia (nonpneumonia group). Results. Among 4232 cases with World Health Organization-defined severe or very severe pneumonia, we identified 1935 (45.7%) with radiographic pneumonia and 573 (13.5%) with nonpneumonia. The organism detection yield was marginally improved with IS specimens (96.2% vs 92.4% for NP/OP specimens for all viruses combined [P = .41]; 96.9% vs 93.3% for all bacteria combined [P = .01]). After accounting for presence in NP/OP specimens, no organism was detected more frequently in the IS specimens from the radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases. Among high-quality IS specimens, there were no statistically significant differences in organism density, except with cytomegalovirus, for which there was a higher quantity in the IS specimens from cases with radiographic pneumonia compared with the nonpneumonia cases (median cycle threshold value, 27.9 vs 28.5, respectively; P = .01). Conclusions. Using advanced molecular methods with IS specimens provided little additional diagnostic information beyond that obtained with NP/OP swab specimens. ?

Lack of a gold standard for identifying bacterial and viral etiologies of pneumonia has limited evaluation of C-reactive protein (CRP) for identifying bacterial pneumonia. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of CRP for identifying bacterial vs respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) pneumonia in the Pneumonia Etiology Research for Child Health (PERCH) multicenter case-control study. Methods. We measured serum CRP levels in cases with World Health Organization-defined severe or very severe pneumonia and a subset of community controls. We evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of elevated CRP for ""confirmed"" bacterial pneumonia (positive blood culture or positive lung aspirate or pleural fluid culture or polymerase chain reaction [PCR]) compared to ""RSV pneumonia"" (nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal or induced sputum PCR-positive without confirmed/suspected bacterial pneumonia). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to assess the performance of elevated CRP in distinguishing these cases. Results. Among 601 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative tested controls, 3% had CRP ?40 mg/L. Among 119 HIVnegative cases with confirmed bacterial pneumonia, 77% had CRP ?40 mg/L compared with 17% of 556 RSV pneumonia cases. The ROC analysis produced an area under the curve of 0.87, indicating very good discrimination; a cut-point of 37.1 mg/L best discriminated confirmed bacterial pneumonia (sensitivity 77%) from RSV pneumonia (specificity 82%). CRP ?100 mg/L substantially improved specificity over CRP ?40 mg/L, though at a loss to sensitivity. Conclusions. Elevated CRP was positively associated with confirmed bacterial pneumonia and negatively associated with RSV pneumonia in PERCH.

Examining the network of social relations may help us reveal important information about our psyche. We build on this idea and propose a model that is consistent with social psychological theories and connects individuals' emotional states with their social relations. The model consists of a social network of agents. Using a centrality-based measure of self-evaluation, the model quantifies the amount of interpersonal loss experienced by agents as their social relation- s change. Applying this model, we analyze interpersonal loss of agents in standard network structures under different conditions. We then draw a link to suicide and discuss two real-world suicide incidents. Finally, we simulate dynamics of large random networks and investigate how network structures affect suicide ideation and its possible cascades. ?

Hindering progress in our mechanistic understanding of olfactory dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is the paucity of literature about the human olfactory bulb, both from normal and Parkinson's disease cases. Qualitatively it is well established that the neat arrangement of the glomerular array seen in the mouse olfactory bulb is missing in humans. But rigorous quantitative approaches to describe and compare the thousands of glomeruli in the human olfactory bulb are not available. Here we report a quantitative approach to describe the glomerular component of the human olfactory bulb, and its application to draw statistical comparisons between olfactory bulbs from normal and Parkinson's disease cases. We subjected horizontal 10 mm sections of olfactory bulbs from six normal and five Parkinson's disease cases to fluorescence immunohistochemistry with antibodies against vesicular glutamate transporter-2 and neural cell adhesion molecule. We scanned the immunostained sections with a fluorescence slide scanner, segmented the glomeruli, and generated 3D reconstructions of whole olfactory bulbs. We document the occurrence of atypical glomerular morphologies and glomerular-like structures deep in the olfactory bulb, both in normal and Parkinson's disease cases. We define a novel and objective parameter: the global glomerular voxel volume, which is the total volume of all voxels that are classified immunohistochemically as glomerular. We find that the global glomerular voxel volume in Parkinson's disease cases is half that of normal cases. The distribution of glomerular voxels along the dorsal-ventral dimension of the olfactory bulb in these series of horizontal sections is significantly altered in Parkinson's disease cases: whereas most glomerular voxels reside within the ventral half of olfactory bulbs from normal cases, glomerular voxels are more evenly spread among the ventral and dorsal halves of olfactory bulbs from Parkinson's disease cases. These quantitative whole-olfactory bulb analyses indicate a predominantly ventral deficit in the glomerular component in Parkinson's disease, consistent with the olfactory vector hypothesis for the pathogenesis of this neurodegenerative disease. The distribution of serine 129-phosphorylated a-synuclein immunoreactive voxels correlates with that of glomerular voxels. The higher the serine 129-phosphorylated a-synuclein load of an olfactory bulb from a Parkinson's disease case, the lower the global glomerular voxel volume. Our rigorous quantitative approach to the whole olfactory bulb will help understand the anatomy and histology of the normal human olfactory bulb and its pathological alterations in Parkinson's disease. ?

The overall poor performance in health care is reflected in the form of enormous burden of communicable and non-communicable diseases, and high maternal, neonatal and infant mortality rates. These issues are coupled with a reduced health sector investment and a lack of health insurance schemes. There is no pharmacovigilance system, and there are also problems with counterfeit medications. Nevertheless, Pakistan has a dynamic pharmaceutical sector ranking10th largest in the Asia-Pacific region and fulfilling 70% of the country’s medicinal demands. Many finished pharmaceutical products from Pakistan have been deemed acceptable by countries across Asia, Africa and the United States. Pharmaceutical regulation is governed by the Drug Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) which ensures the implementation of the Drugs Act, 1976 (XXXI of 1976). Pakistan’s national essential medicine list (NEML) is based on the WHO standards and promotes generic prescribing; however, this list is generally only followed in the public sector hospitals. The majority of prescribers in the private sector health facilities are influenced by pharmaceutical marketing. There are concerns related to underuse and overuse of certain medicines reflecting an irrational medicines use in the country. There are also policy concerns related to drug pricing due to an absence of a sound medicine pricing formula. A full range of essential drugs is not available in public sector hospitals, either because of inadequate operational budget or due to lack of efficient management. Many consumers in Pakistan can buy medicines without prescription, leading to poor dispensing practices. However, despite numerous issues, the country has shown signs of improvement with regard to healthcare system. The Prime Minister’s National Health Insurance Program initiative, the establishment of drug testing laboratories and the strict punishments for the breach of laws related to medicines’ related offences are few examples that show that the government is serious to improve healthcare. ?

Therefore, we review the literature of, (i) the occurrences of 1a in humans, waters and products and the effectiveness of widely deployed mitigation methods in 1a stewardship and, (ii) the adverse effects of 1a exposures on human cells and fish. Within this broad context, we present and evaluate experimental results on TAML/H2O2 purification of 1a contaminated waters. TAML/H2O2 catalysis readily oxidizes BPA (1a) and the ring-tetramethyl (1b), tetrachloro (1c), and tetrabromo (1d)-substituted derivatives. At pH 8.5, TAML/H2O2 induces controllable, oxidative oligomerisation of 1a (2-, 3-, 4-, and 5-unit species were identified) with precipitation, establishing a green synthetic pathway to these substances for biological safety characterisation and an easy method for near quantitative removal of 1a from water. TAML/H2O2 (24 nM/4 mM) treatment of 1a (10000 μg L-1) in pH 8.5 (0.01 M, carbonate) lab water effects a &gt;99% reduction (to &lt;100 μg L-11a) within 30 min. Yeast oestrogen screens (YES) of the pH 8.5, TAML/H2O2 treated, catalase quenched, and filtered oxidation solutions show elimination of 1a oestrogenicity. Zebrafish developmental assays of TAML/H2O2 treated, unfiltered, agitated pH 7, 1a solutions showed no significant incidences of abnormality among any of 22 endpoints - treated samples showed an insignificant increase in mortality. At pH 11, the TAML/H2O2 oxidations of 1a-d are fast with second order rate constants for the substrate oxidation process (kII values) of (0.57-8) × 104 M-1 s-1. The 1a oxidation gives CO and CO2 (?78%), acetone (?25%) and formate (?1%). In striking contrast with pH 8.5 treatment, no oligomers were detected. TAML/H2O2 (150 nM/7.5 mM) treatment of 1a (34244 μg L-1) in pH 11 (0.01 M, phosphate) lab water effected a &gt;99.9% reduction (to &lt;23 μg L-11a) within 15 min. The pH dependent behaviour of 1a was examined as a possible origin of the differing outcomes. The 1st and 2nd pKa values of 1a were estimated by fitting the pH dependence of the UV-vis spectra (pKa1 = 9.4 ± 0.3; pKa2 = 10.37 ± 0.07). At pH 8.5, coupling of the radical produced on initial oxidation evidently outcompetes further oxidation. A linear free energy relationship between the logarithm of the pH 11, kII values and the redox potentials of 1a-d as determined by differential pulse voltammetry in CH3CN is consistent with rate-limiting, electron transfer from the dianionic form of 1a at pH 11, followed by a multistep, deep degradation without observation of 4-(prop-1-en-2-yl)phenol 12, a common 1a oxidation product - an improved synthesis of 12 is described. Microtox? analyses of pH 12, TAML/H2O2 treated 1a solutions showed significantly reduced toxicity. The facility and high efficiency by which TAML/H2O2 catalysis eliminates 1a from water, by either mechanism, suggests a new and simple procedure for 1a stewardship. ?

These children are also at risk of significant morbidity, with acute and chronic impact on the family and the health and social care systems. The current recommended first-choice, second-line treatment in children aged 6 months and above is intravenous phenytoin (fosphenytoin in the USA), although there is a lack of evidence for its use and it is associated with significant side effects. Emerging evidence suggests that intravenous levetiracetam may be effective as a second-line agent for CSE, and fewer adverse effects have been described. This trial therefore aims to determine whether intravenous phenytoin or levetiracetam is more effective, and safer, in treating childhood CSE. Methods/design: This is a phase IV, multi-centre, parallel group, randomised controlled, open-label trial. Following treatment for CSE with first-line treatment, children with ongoing seizures are randomised to receive either phenytoin (20 mg/kg, maximum 2 g) or levetiracetam (40 mg/kg, maximum 2.5 g) intravenously. The primary outcome measure is the cessation of all visible signs of CSE as determined by the treating clinician. Secondary outcome measures include the need for further anti-seizure medications or rapid sequence induction for ongoing CSE, admission to critical care areas, and serious adverse reactions. Patients are recruited without prior consent, with deferred consent sought at an appropriate time for the family. The primary analysis will be by intention-to-treat. The primary outcome is a time to event outcome and a sample size of 140 participants in each group will have 80% power to detect an increase in CSE cessation rates from 60% to 75%. Our total sample size of 308 randomised and treated participants will allow for 10% loss to follow-up. Discussion: This clinical trial will determine whether phenytoin or levetiracetam is more effective as an intravenous second-line agent for CSE, and provide evidence for management recommendations. In addition, this trial will also provide data on which of these therapies is safer in this setting. ?

Young children are an age group for whom antibiotics are frequently prescribed. Objectives: To describe community antibiotic dispensing during the first 5 years of life in a large, socioeconomically and ethnically diverse cohort of children, and to determine how antibiotic dispensing varied between population subgroups. Methods: This study was performed within the Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal cohort study (www.gro wingup.co.nz) with linkage to national administrative antibiotic dispensing data. Descriptive statistics and univariate andmultivariable associations were determined. Results: The 5581 cohort children received 53 052 antibiotic courses, of which 54% were amoxicillin. By age 5 years, 97% of children had received one or more antibiotic courses, and each child had received a median of eight antibiotic courses (IQR 4-13). The mean incidence of antibiotic dispensing was 1.9 courses/child/year. Multivariable negative binomial regression showed that M?ori and Pacific children received more antibiotic courses than European children, as did children in the most-deprived compared with the least-deprived areas. A distinct seasonal pattern was noted. Conclusions: This study provided a detailed description of antibiotic dispensing within a large and diverse child cohort. Antibiotic exposure was near universal by age 5 years. The predominance of amoxicillin use and the seasonal pattern suggest much antibiotic use may have been for self-limiting respiratory infections. There is a need for safe and effective interventions to improve antibiotic prescribing practices for New Zealand children. ? The Author 2017.

In this article, we summarise the potential benefits of reducing nicotine in combusted tobacco and address some of the common concerns. We focus specifically on New Zealand because it may be ideally situated to implement such a policy. The available data suggest that, in current smokers, very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes decrease nicotine exposure, decrease cigarette dependence, reduce the number of cigarettes smoked per day and increase the likelihood of contemplating, making and succeeding at a quit attempt. New smokers would almost certainly be exposed to far less nicotine as a result of smoking VLNC cigarettes and, consequently, would probably be less likely to become chronic, dependent, smokers. Many of the concerns about reducing nicotine including compensatory smoking, an exacerbation of psychiatric symptoms, the perception that VLNC cigarettes are less harmful, and the potential for a black market are either not supported by the available data, likely mitigated by other factors including the availability of nicotinecontaining e-cigarettes, or unlikely to offset the potential benefit to public health. Although not all concerns have been addressed or can be a priori, the magnitude of the potential benefits and the growing evidence of relatively few potential harms should make nicotine reduction one of the centrepieces for discussion of how to rapidly advance tobacco control. Policies that aim to render the most toxic tobacco products less addictive could help New Zealand attain their goal of becoming smokefree by 2025.",,nicotine; analysis; electronic cigarette; epidemiology; health care policy; human; New Zealand; procedures; smoking; smoking cessation; statistics and numerical data; tobacco; tobacco dependence; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Health Policy; Humans; New Zealand; Nicotine; Smokers; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Products; Tobacco Use Disorder,2-s2.0-85021287664

In humans, debate surrounds the role of environmental pathogens and economic development in determining facial attractiveness. We tested whether women and men's preferences for facial dimorphism, symmetry, skin tone, and adiposity differ among Melanesian participants from 3 islands (Espiritu Santo, Efate, and Tanna) in Vanuatu in the South West Pacific. These islands vary in their historical malarial pathogens respectively from pronounced to almost absent and are characterized by within and between island differences in economic development, ranging from urbanized market-based economies to remote rural horticultural communities. We found no support for the hypothesis that masculine male faces or feminine female faces are more attractive in environments with higher exposure to malarial pathogens or urban development. However, preferences for facial symmetry were highest in islands with higher malarial rates, possibly as symmetry indicates health and guides mate selection in disease rich environments. However, past evidence linking symmetry and health is weak, and we therefore interpret our findings cautiously. Women from peri-urban communities preferred male faces with lighter skin to rural and urban participants. Men from urban areas stated higher preferences for symmetry than peri-urban and rural male participants. All other effects were not statistically significant.

The majority of these risk variants reside in noncoding regions of the genome making their functional evaluation difficult; however, they also infer the presence of unconventional regulatory regions that may reside at these locations. We know from these studies that rare familial cases of AD account for less than 5% of all AD cases and autosomal dominant mutations in APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 account for less than 10% of the genetic basis of these familial cases [1]. The sporadic form of AD, while more complex, still has a substantial genetic component evidenced by observational studies where 30–48% of AD patients have a first degree relative who is also affected [2]. In addition, the strongest risk factor after age is the APOE E4 polymorphism, and more than 20 other risk variants have been identified to date, reviewed in two recent papers [3, 4]. Monozygotic twin studies have revealed a discordance for AD, implicating that a combination of epigenetic and genetic factors are likely involved in the development of AD [5]. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Epigenetics; Histone modifications; Human brain,"4 phenylbutyric acid; amyloid precursor protein; apolipoprotein E4; butyric acid; histone acetyltransferase; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase inhibitor; histone H2A; histone H2B; histone H3; histone H4; histone methyltransferase; presenilin 1; presenilin 2; tadalafil; valproic acid; vorinostat; apolipoprotein E4; histone; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase inhibitor; histone lysine methyltransferase; histone methyltransferase; nerve protein; Alzheimer disease; APOE E4 gene; APP gene; autosomal dominant inheritance; chromatin immunoprecipitation; cognitive defect; drug potentiation; enzyme regulation; epigenetics; family study; gene; gene mutation; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; heredity; histone code; histone methylation; histone modification; human; memory disorder; monozygotic twins; nonhuman; observational study; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein processing; PSEN1 gene; PSEN2 gene; relative; risk assessment; risk factor; twin discordance; acetylation; Alzheimer disease; animal; brain chemistry; disease model; genetic epigenesis; genetics; histone code; metabolism; methylation; mouse; mutation; phosphorylation; Acetylation; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Apolipoprotein E4; Brain Chemistry; Disease Models, Animal; Epigenesis, Genetic; Histone Code; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Histone Deacetylases; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Histones; Humans; Methylation; Mice; Mutation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Phosphorylation; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85020433703

Objective: We examined the cross-sectional associations of dietary protein intake from different food sources during pregnancy with the risk of GDM in a multiethnic Asian population. Methods: We included 980 participants with singleton pregnancies from the Growing Up in Singapore Toward healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort. Protein intake was ascertained from 24-h dietary recall and 3-d food diaries at 26-28 wk gestation. GDM was defined as fasting glucose ?7.0 mmol/L and/or 2-h postload glucose ?7.8 mmol/L at 26-28 wk gestation. We evaluated the association of dietary protein intake with GDM risk by substituting carbohydrate with protein in an isocaloric model with the use of multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: The prevalence of GDM was 17.9% among our participants. After adjustment for potential confounders, a higher total dietary protein intake was associated with a higher risk of GDM; the OR comparing the highest with the lowest quartile of intake was 2.15 (95% CI: 1.27, 3.62; P-trend = 0.016). Higher intake levels of both animal protein (OR: 2.87; 95% CI: 1.58, 5.20; P-trend = 0.001) and vegetable protein (OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 0.99, 3.20; P-trend = 0.009) were associated with a higher risk of GDM. Among the animal protein sources, higher intake levels of seafood protein (OR: 2.17; 95%CI: 1.26, 3.72; P-trend = 0.023) and dairy protein (OR: 1.87; 95% CI: 1.11, 3.15; P-trend = 0.017) were significantly associated with a higher GDM risk.

However, formalised or structured pharmacy services to support consumers with mental health conditions are scarce. Australian mental health consumers indicated a need for targeted community pharmacy mental health services which presented an opportunity to develop an intervention that were integrated with remunerated professional services. Objectives The study aimed to pilot a mental health medication management intervention in Australian community pharmacies. Pharmacists worked in partnership with consumers, carers and mental health workers over three to six months to set and support achievement of individual goals related to medicines use, physical health and mental wellbeing. This paper provides a comparison of community pharmacies that successfully delivered the intervention with those that did not and identifies facilitators and challenges to service implementation. Methods One hundred pharmacies opted to pilot the delivery of the intervention in three Australian states (Queensland, Western Australia and northern New South Wales). Of those, 55 successfully delivered the intervention (completers) whilst 45 were unsuccessful (non-completers). A mixed methods approach, including quantitative pharmacy surveys and qualitative semi-structured interviews, was used to gather data from participating pharmacies. Following intervention development, 142 pharmacists and 21 pharmacy support staff attended training workshops, received resource kits and ongoing support from consumer and pharmacist mentors throughout intervention implementation. Baseline quantitative data was collected from each pharmacy on staff profile, volume of medicines dispensed, the range of professional services delivered and relationships with health professionals. At the completion of the study participants were invited to complete an online exit survey and take part in a semi-structured interview that explored their experiences of intervention implementation and delivery. Twenty-nine staff members from completer pharmacies returned exit surveys and interviews were conducted with 30 staff from completer and non-completer pharmacies. Results Descriptive analyses of quantitative data and thematic analyses of qualitative data were used to compare completers and non-completers. Baseline similarities included numbers of general and mental health prescriptions dispensed and established professional services. However, there was greater prevalence of diabetes management, opioid substitution services, and relationships with mental health services in completer pharmacies. Key facilitators for completers included pharmacy owner/manager support, staff buy-in and involvement, intervention flexibility, recruitment immediately following training, integration of intervention with existing services, changes to workflow, and regular consumer contact. Key barriers for both groups included lack of pharmacy owner/manager support or staff buy-in, time constraints, privacy limitations and pilot project associated paperwork. Conclusions Insights into factors that underpinned successful intervention implementation and delivery should inform effective strategies for similar future studies and allocation of pharmacy mental health service delivery resources. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,Australia; human; medication therapy management; mental disease; organization and management; pharmacist; pharmacy; pilot study; Australia; Community Pharmacy Services; Humans; Medication Therapy Management; Mental Disorders; Pharmacists; Pilot Projects,2-s2.0-85020059348

Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome is a rare, severe adverse event during treatment with raltegravir. The occurrence of DRESS syndrome during treatment with other drugs is strongly associated with particular HLA alleles. Methods. We performed HLA testing in 3 of the 5 patients previously reported to have developed raltegravir-induced DRESS syndrome and in 1 previously unreported patient. We then used virtual modeling to visualize interactions between raltegravir and the imputed HLA molecule. Results. Five of the 6 patients who developed raltegravir-induced DRESS syndrome were African, and 1 was Hispanic. HLA typing was performed in 4 patients, all of whom carried both the HLA-B?53 allele and the HLA-C?04 allele to which it is commonly haplotypic. No other HLA alleles were shared by all of the tested patients. Given the approximate prevalence of HLA-B?53 carriage in African (20%) and Hispanic (6%) populations, the probability of all 4 patients being HLA-B?53 carriers, and 2 of 3 African patients being homozygous for HLA-B?53:01, is approximately 0.00002. Conclusions. These data implicate the prevalent African allele HLA-B?53:01 in the immunopathogenesis of raltegravir-induced DRESS syndrome. Although the immunopathogenic mechanisms are currently unknown, virtual modeling suggests that raltegravir may bind within the antigen binding cleft of the HLA-B?53:01 molecule, but not within the closely related HLA-B?35:01 molecule. Further studies are necessary to confirm the strength of the association between carriage of the HLA-B?53:01 allele and raltegravir- induced DRESS syndrome, and the potential utility of HLA screening before raltegravir treatment. ?

However, economic research in palliative care is very limited and little is known about the range and extent of the costs that are involved in palliative care provision. Aim: To undertake a systematic review of the health and social care literature to determine the range of financial costs related to a palliative care approach and explore approaches used to measure these costs. Design: A systematic review of empirical literature with thematic synthesis. Study quality was evaluated using the Weight of Evidence Framework. Data sources: The databases CINAHL, Cochrane, PsycINFO and Medline were searched from 1995 to November 2015 for empirical studies which presented data on the financial costs associated with palliative care. Results: A total of 38 papers met our inclusion criteria. Components of palliative care costs were incurred within four broad domains: hospital care, community or home-based care, hospice care and informal care. These costs could be considered from the economic viewpoint of three providers: state or government, insurers/third-party/not-for-profit organisations and patient and family and/or society. A wide variety of costing approaches were used to derive costs. Conclusion: The evidence base regarding the economics of palliative care is sparse, particularly relating to the full economic costs of palliative care.

It is standard practice for laboratories to assess the cellular quality of expectorated sputum specimens to check that they originated from the lower respiratory tract. The presence of low numbers of squamous epithelial cells (SECs) and high numbers of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells are regarded as indicative of a lower respiratory tract specimen. However, these quality ratings have never been evaluated for induced sputum specimens from children with suspected pneumonia. Methods. We evaluated induced sputum Gram stain smears and cultures from hospitalized children aged 1-59 months enrolled in a large study of community-acquired pneumonia. We hypothesized that a specimen representative of the lower respiratory tract will contain smaller quantities of oropharyngeal flora and be more likely to have a predominance of potential pathogens compared to a specimen containing mainly saliva. The prevalence of potential pathogens cultured from induced sputum specimens and quantity of oropharyngeal flora were compared for different quantities of SECs and PMNs. Results. Of 3772 induced sputum specimens, 2608 (69%) had <10 SECs per low-power field (LPF) and 2350 (62%) had >25 PMNs per LPF, measures traditionally associated with specimens from the lower respiratory tract in adults. Using isolation of low quantities of oropharyngeal flora and higher prevalence of potential pathogens as markers of higher quality, <10 SECs per LPF (but not >25 PMNs per LPF) was the microscopic variable most associated with high quality of induced sputum. Conclusions. Quantity of SECs may be a useful quality measure of induced sputum from young children with pneumonia. ?

Methods and results Individual person linkage of national data sets identified all IHD hospitalizations and deaths in New Zealand from December 2008 to November 2010. Outcome measures were proportions of people: (i) hospitalized with IHD and alive at 28 days; (ii) hospitalized with IHD and died within 28 days; (iii) hospitalized for a non-IHD cause and died from IHD within 28 days; and (iv) not hospitalized and died from IHD. Three event definitions were used [broad-balanced: IHD deaths and IHD hospitalizations, unbalanced: IHD deaths and myocardial infarction (MI) hospitalizations, and narrow-balanced: MI deaths and MI hospitalizations]. About 37 867 IHD hospitalizations and 9409 IHD deaths were identified using the broad IHD definition. Approximately one-quarter of IHD events were fatal: 4% were deaths within 28 days of an IHD hospitalization, 6% were IHD deaths within 28 days of a non-IHD hospitalization, and 14% were nonhospitalized IHD deaths. Using different event definitions, overall case fatality varied from 24-25% (broad and narrow balanced) to 37-39% (unbalanced), whereas the proportion of all deaths that were non-hospitalized was approximately 60%. Forty per cent of deaths were first-ever events that manifested as non-hospitalized IHD deaths. Conclusion About one-quarter of IHD are fatal, although the proportion is dependent on disease definitions and age. About 60% of all IHD deaths occur out of hospital, and of these 60% are in people not previously hospitalized for IHD. ?

The modern scientific era of medical light therapy and skin diseases started in 1877 when Downs and Blunt reported that exposure to light inhibited fungal growth in test tubes. Continuing research generated a growing medical interest in the potential the effects of light to treat and cure skin diseases considered as parasitic. This culminated in the awarding of the 1903 Nobel Prize in Medicine to Niels Finsen for his pioneering work showing that light could successfully treat cutaneous mycobacterium tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris), a disfiguring disorder common at the time. Cod liver oil was used as a folk remedy to treat rickets prior to 1789 in Manchester, UK and sunlight was published as the cure for this disease in 1921. The work by Hess and Weinstock in 1925 showed that food irradiated with ultraviolet (UV) light prevented rickets in rats, which paved the way for the discovery of vitamin D. The range of skin diseases treated by light therapy increased in the following years, to the point where a 1932 review by the American Medical Association on the use of UV therapy in dermatology listed 34 skin conditions for which UV radiation may be useful. This period coincided with the development of sanatoria in Europe and North America which used heliotherapy for the treatment of tuberculosis. UV therapy and vitamin D continued to be used successfully for the treatment of tuberculosis up to the 1950s when it was superseded by more effective antibiotics. Modern phototherapy developed in the 1980s with the discovery of the action spectrum for psoriasis leading to the development of narrow band UVB. Subsequently a biological mechanism by which UV light and vitamin D treated tuberculosis was identified in 2006. This involves activation of human macrophages via toll-like receptors to upregulate the vitamin D receptor gene resulting in induction of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin. The role of UV light and vitamin D in the treatment of skin diseases is currently an active area of research. ?

We assessed data on 201,382 women (born in 1973-1988) from the Swedish Birth Register. The mean age was 26.0 years. Of the women in our cohort, 663 were born very preterm (<32 weeks of gestation), 8,247 were born moderately preterm (at least 32 weeks but <37 weeks), and 192,472 were born at term (37-41 weeks). Subgroup analyses were carried out among siblings and also after adjustment for maternal anthropometric data. Statistical tests were 2-sided. Decreasing gestational age was associated with lower height (-1.1 mm per week of gestation; P < 0.0001), so that women who were born very preterm were on average 12 mm shorter than women who were born moderately preterm (P < 0.0001) and 17 mm shorter than women born at term (P < 0.0001). Compared with women who were born at term, those who were born very preterm had 2.9 times higher odds of short stature (<155.4 cm), and those born moderately preterm had 1.43 times higher odds. Subgroup analyses showed no differences between women born moderately preterm and those born at term but accentuated differences from women born very preterm. Among siblings (n = 2,388), very preterm women were 23 mm shorter than those born at term (P = 0.003), with a 20-mm difference observed in subgroup analyses (n = 27,395) that were adjusted for maternal stature (P < 0.001). A shorter final height was associated with decreasing gestational age, and this association was particularly marked in women born very preterm. ? The Author 2016.

M. tuberculosis latently infects a third of the world's population, resulting in ~1.5 million deaths per year. Due to the difficulties and expense of carrying out animal drug trials using M. tuberculosis and rodents, infections of the zebrafish Danio rerio with Mycobacterium marinum have become a useful surrogate. However, the infection methods described to date require specialized equipment and a high level of operator expertise. Methods: We investigated whether zebrafish larvae could be naturally infected with bioluminescently labelled M. marinum by immersion, and whether infected larvae could be used for rapid screening of anti-mycobacterial compounds using bioluminescence. We used rifampicin and a variety of nitroimidazole-based next-generation and experimental anti-mycobacterial drugs, selected for their wide range of potencies against M. tuberculosis, to validate this model for anti-mycobacterial drug discovery. Results:We observed that five of the six treatments (rifampicin, pretomanid, delamanid, SN30488 and SN30527) significantly reduced the bioluminescent signal from M. marinum within naturally infected zebrafish larvae. Importantly, these same five treatments also retarded the growth of M. tuberculosis in vitro. In contrast, only three of the six treatments tested (rifampicin, delamanid and SN30527) retarded the growth of M. marinum in vitro. Conclusions:We have demonstrated that zebrafish larvae naturally infected with bioluminescent M. marinum M can be used for the rapid screening of anti-mycobacterial compounds with readily available equipment and limited expertise. The result is an assay that can be carried out by a wide variety of laboratories for minimal cost and without high levels of zebrafish expertise. ?

Our objective was to develop multivariable prediction models for small for gestational age combining clinical risk factors and biomarkers at 15±1 weeks' with ultrasound parameters at 20±1 weeks' gestation. Methods: Data from 5606 participants in the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) cohort study were divided into Training (n = 3735) and Validation datasets (n = 1871). The primary outcomes were All-SGA (small for gestational age with birthweight <10th customised centile), Normotensive-SGA (small for gestational age with a normotensive mother) and Hypertensive- SGA (small for gestational age with an hypertensive mother). The comparison group comprised women without the respective small for gestational age phenotype. Multivariable analysis was performed using stepwise logistic regression beginning with clinical variables, and subsequent additions of biomarker and then ultrasound (biometry and Doppler) variables. Model performance was assessed in Training and Validation datasets by calculating area under the curve. Results: 633 (11.2%) infants were All-SGA, 465(8.2%) Normotensive-SGA and 168 (3%) Hypertensive- SGA. Area under the curve (95% Confidence Intervals) for All-SGA using 15±1 weeks' clinical variables, 15±1 weeks' clinical+ biomarker variables and clinical + biomarkers + biometry/Doppler at 20±1 weeks' were: 0.63 (0.59-0.67), 0.64 (0.60-0.68) and 0.69 (0.66-0.73) respectively in the Validation dataset; Normotensive-SGA results were similar: 0.61 (0.57-0.66), 0.61 (0.56-0.66) and 0.68 (0.64-0.73) with small increases in performance in the Training datasets. Area under the curve (95% Confidence Intervals) for Hypertensive- SGA were: 0.76 (0.70-0.82), 0.80 (0.75-0.86) and 0.84 (0.78-0.89) with minimal change in the Training datasets. Conclusion: Models for prediction of small for gestational age, which combine biomarkers, clinical and ultrasound data from a cohort of low-risk nulliparous women achieved modest performance. Incorporation of biomarkers into the models resulted in no improvement in performance of prediction of All-SGA and Normotensive-SGA but a small improvement in prediction of Hypertensive-SGA. Our models currently have insufficient reliability for application in clinical practice however, they have potential utility in two-staged screening tests which include third trimester biomarkers and or fetal biometry. ? 2017 McCowan et al.

While a growing body of theoretical and empirical literature has identified plausible protective factors and explored their underlying mechanisms and additional value to risk factors, little has been written concerning clinical assessment of protective factors. A challenge faced by clinicians working in correctional and forensic settings is how to translate emerging knowledge into applied approaches to assessment and treatment. The current paper explores the clinical assessment of protective factors. Within often time-pressed legal and clinical practice environments, feasible assessment methods are needed that add value to the current predominantly risk-focused assessment practice. The valid and reliable assessment of protective factors should aid in risk-management decision-making and help inform strengths-based treatment efforts. This paper aims to demonstrate ways to bridge the gap between theoretical and empirical knowledge regarding protective factors and their clinical applicability, and to highlight the added value of assessing protective factors. Several protective factor assessment tools are described and short cases are used to exemplify how consideration of protective factors can enhance clinical practice. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Desistance; Protective factors; Risk assessment; Strengths; Treatment; Violence,clinical practice; cooperation; forensic medicine; human; legal aspect; medical decision making; motivation; practice guideline; protection; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; risk management; risk reduction; sexual violence; violence,2-s2.0-85008318940

There is a need to develop a finite course of treatment which can provide sustained off-treatment virological and clinical response. The likely marker of such a clinical HBV CURE would be HBsAg clearance, but in addition cccDNA elimination would be required to prevent future reactivation (ie complete HBV cure). Chronic HBV infection is characterised by high viral and antigen burden and inadequate host immune responses, both of which will need to be overcome to achieve HBV CURE. Innovative approaches to restore innate and adaptive immune responses against HBV currently in clinical development include therapeutic vaccines, TLR-7 and TLR-8 agonists. In future, strategies to reverse T-cell exhaustion such as checkpoint inhibitors may be feasible. Currently, the only antivirals in clinical use are the HBV polymerase inhibitors. However, many other steps of HBV virion life cycle can be targeted by small molecules, including inhibitors of HBV entry, nucleocapsid formation and virion assembly and release. siRNAs could inhibit many different steps by blocking multiple HBV transcripts. But, the ultimate goal will be to successfully eradicate or silence cccDNA. It is likely that successful HBV cure will require combination of immunomodulatory, antiviral and cccDNA silencing strategies. Efficacy, safety, route of administration and cost will ultimately determine the impact of these new regimens on the burden of HBV. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We thus aimed to investigate the relations between maternal dietary patterns and offspring adiposity in a multi-ethnic Asian mother-offspring cohort in Singapore. We derived maternal dietary patterns using maternal dietary intake information at 26-28 weeks of gestation, of which associations with offspring body mass index (BMI), abdominal circumference (AC), subscapular skinfold (SS), and triceps skinfold (TS) were assessed using longitudinal data analysis (linear mixed effects (LME)) and multiple linear regression at ages 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 54 months. Three dietary patterns were derived: (1) vegetables-fruit-and-white rice (VFR); (2) seafood-and-noodles (SfN); and (3) pasta-cheese-and-bread (PCB). In the LME model adjusting for potential confounders, each standard deviation (SD) increase in maternal VFR pattern score was associated with 0.09 mm lower offspring TS. Individual time-point analysis additionally revealed that higher VFR score was generally associated with lower postnatal offspring BMI z-score, TS, SS, and sum of skinfolds (SS + TS) at ages 18 months and older. Maternal adherence to a dietary pattern characterized by higher intakes of fruit and vegetables and lower intakes of fast food was associated with lower offspring adiposity. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Adiposity; BMI; Children; Developmental origins of health and diseases; Dietary patterns; Fruit; Pregnancy; Subscapular skinfold; Triceps skinfold; Vegetables,"abdominal circumference; Article; body mass; bread; cheese; child; childhood obesity; dietary intake; fast food; female; fruit; gestation period; human; infant; male; maternal nutrition; nutritional assessment; pregnancy; progeny; rice; scoring system; sea food; skinfold; triceps brachii muscle; vegetable; adolescent; adult; blood; diet; healthy diet; middle aged; obesity; preschool child; prospective study; questionnaire; Singapore; statistical model; young adult; folic acid; vitamin D; Adiposity; Adolescent; Adult; Body Mass Index; Child, Preschool; Diet; Female; Folic Acid; Fruit; Healthy Diet; Humans; Infant; Linear Models; Male; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Middle Aged; Nutrition Assessment; Pregnancy; Prospective Studies; Singapore; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vegetables; Vitamin D; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85007388313

Low nano-molar potency was observed in the sea urchin embryos for the most active compounds (1–5) suggestive of a microtubule-destabilising effect. The molecular modelling studies indicated that the tubulin colchicine site is inhibited, which often leads to microtubule-destabilisation in line with the sea urchin embryo results.

We aimed to compare patient outcomes between diabetic and non-diabetic transplant recipients, and to determine the effect of age and era on patient survival. Methods This population cohort study included all primary kidney-only transplant recipients included in the Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant registry between Jan 1, 1994, and Dec 31, 2012. The primary outcomes were all-cause mortality and death with functioning graft. Associations between outcomes and diabetes status were examined using adjusted Cox regression, and interactions between diabetes status and transplant era and recipient age were examined. Findings Of 10?714 transplant recipients, 985 (9%) had type 2 diabetes. Mortality rates in the first 10 years after transplantation were higher in recipients with diabetes (25·3 per 100 recipients) compared to those without diabetes (11·5 per 100 recipients). Compared with recipients without diabetes, the adjusted hazard ratios (HR) for all-cause mortality and death with a functioning graft in recipients with diabetes were 1·60 (95% CI 1·37–1·86; p&lt;0·0001) and 1·54 (1·28–1·85 p&lt;0·0001), respectively. The association between diabetes status, all-cause mortality, and death with a functioning graft was modified by recipient age (pinteraction&lt;0·0001), with the highest risk in recipients with diabetes aged younger than 40 years (adjusted HR 5·16 [95% CI 2·84–9·35], p&lt;0·0001; and 9·83 [4·51–21·43], p&lt;0·0001; for all-cause mortality and death with a functioning graft, respectively). Risk was increased to a lesser extent in recipients with diabetes aged older than 55 years (adjusted HR 1·41 [95% CI 1·17–1·71; p=0·002] and 1·27 [1·02–1·59; p=0·03], for all-cause mortality and death with a functioning graft, respectively). Transplant era did not modify the association between diabetes status and mortality. Interpretation Kidney transplant recipients with type 2 diabetes had substantially poorer patient survival, with 5-year mortality rates exceeding those for non-diabetic recipients by over two times. The magnitude of this survival disadvantage was greatest in recipients with diabetes aged less than 40 years. By contrast with the general population, there was no evidence of improvement in mortality over time among people with type 2 diabetes following kidney transplantation.

Methods: Clinical data were obtained from 264 patients. Total concentrations for S- and R-warfarin were measured by ultra-high performance liquid tandem mass spectrometry. Genotypes were measured using pyrosequencing. A sequential population PK parameter with data method was used to describe the international normalized ratio (INR) time course. Data were analyzed with NONMEM. Model evaluation was based on parameter plausibility and prediction-corrected visual predictive checks. Results: Warfarin PK was described using a one-compartment model. CYP2C9 *1/*3 genotype had reduced clearance for S-warfarin, but increased clearance for R-warfarin. The in vitro parameters for the relationship between prothrombin complex activity (PCA) and INR were markedly different (A?=?0.560, B?=?0.386) from the theory-based values (A?=?1, B?=?0). There was a small difference between healthy subjects and patients. A sigmoid Emax PD model inhibiting PCA synthesis as a function of S-warfarin concentration predicted INR. Small R-warfarin effects was described by competitive antagonism of S-warfarin inhibition. Patients with VKORC1 AA and CYP4F2 CC or CT genotypes had lower C50 for S-warfarin. Conclusion: A theory-based PKPD model describes warfarin concentrations and clinical response. Expected PK and PD genotype effects were confirmed. The role of predicted fat free mass with theory-based allometric scaling of PK parameters was identified. R-warfarin had a minor effect compared with S-warfarin on PCA synthesis.

However, the effect of surgery on the sinonasal microbiota remains poorly understood. This study examined changes in bacterial communities in CRS patients before and after surgery. Methods: Swab samples were taken from the middle meatus of 23 patients undergoing ESS. Follow-up swabs were taken in clinic (mean 120 days postsurgery). Symptom scores and antibiotic use were recorded. Bacterial communities were characterized using 16s ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene-targeted amplicon sequencing and bacterial abundance was measured using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Coexisting asthma, aspirin sensitivity, antibiotic use, and presence of polyps were controlled for. Results: Unpredictable shifts in bacterial community composition were seen postoperatively. ESS was associated with increased bacterial richness. Many taxa had changes in average relative abundance and prevalence. Staphylococcus was the only dominant taxa to increase significantly in relative abundance (p = 0.002). Changes in bacterial communities were driven more by intersubject variability (p = 0.007) than other study factors. Finegoldia, a minority taxon, was associated with a reduction in abundance following ESS, increases in patients with higher symptoms scores, and reductions in patients with reduced total bacterial burden. Conclusion: This study documented changes in bacterial composition and abundance in the middle meatus following ESS. The complexity of these changes reflects the variability between patients. Modern molecular techniques highlight the currently limited knowledge of the impact of therapies on the microbiology of CRS. ? 2016 ARS-AAOA, LLC",bacteria; microbiota; postoperative period; sinusitis; surgery,"acetylsalicylic acid; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; antibiotic agent; azithromycin; cefaclor; cefalexin; ciprofloxacin; clindamycin; cotrimoxazole; doxycycline; erythromycin; flucloxacillin; RNA 16S; roxithromycin; bacterial RNA; fluticasone; RNA 16S; adult; aged; amplicon; Article; asthma; bacterial load; bacterial microbiome; chronic rhinosinusitis; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; endoscopic sinus surgery; female; Finegoldia; follow up; gene targeting; human; male; microbial community; nonhuman; nose polyp; population abundance; population research; prevalence; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; scoring system; sequence analysis; species composition; species richness; Staphylococcus; taxon; bacterium; chronic disease; classification; endoscopy; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; middle aged; paranasal sinus; rhinitis; sinusitis; Adult; Aged; Bacteria; Chronic Disease; Endoscopy; Female; Fluticasone; Humans; Male; Microbiota; Middle Aged; Paranasal Sinuses; Rhinitis; RNA, Bacterial; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sinusitis",2-s2.0-85005990020

Analysis Multiple regression models determined the relationships between family meals and mental health indicators; sociodemographic variables and family connection were included as covariates. Results Approximately 60% of adolescents shared family meals ?5 times in the previous week, whereas 22% reported that they shared ?2 meals in the previous week. Greater frequency of family meals was associated with fewer depressive symptoms (P?<?.001), fewer emotional difficulties (P?<?.001) and better emotional well-being (<.001). These relationships between family meals and depressive symptoms were attenuated by sex; the relationship was stronger for females than for males. Conclusions and Implications Frequent family meals may have a protective effect on the mental health of adolescents, particularly for depressive symptoms in girls.

Therefore genetic testing is recommended for all patients presenting with MTC. Approximately 40% of MTCs have somatic RET mutations. Somatic mutations in the RAS genes are the next most common driver mutations and appear to be mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation. The single most common somatic RAS mutation is HRASQ61R (c.182A&gt;G), reported in 4.6% to 11% of all MTCs. Mutation-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) initially developed to identify the NRASQ61R mutation in melanoma (clone SP174) has proven highly sensitive and specific. Because the amino acid sequences for the HRAS and NRAS proteins at codon 61 are identical, we postulated that SP174 IHC would also identify the somatic HRASQ61R mutation. IHC with SP174 was performed on a tissue microarray of 68 patients with MTC including 13 (22.8%) with molecularly confirmed MEN2. Seven (10.3%) MTCs demonstrated positive staining. Six of these patients had already undergone germline RET mutation testing as part of clinical care and were all confirmed to be wild type, excluding the diagnosis of MEN2. All SP174 immunohistochemically positive MTCs were proven to have HRASQ61R mutation (and lack KRASQ61R and NRASQ61R) by Sanger sequencing. All MEN2 patients showed negative staining. We conclude that IHC with SP174 is highly specific for the HRASQ61R mutation in MTC. Because current data suggest that this mutation is mutually exclusive with germline RET mutation, IHC may also have a role in triaging formal genetic testing for MEN2. ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",HRASQ61R; medullary thyroid cancer; MEN2; NRASQ61R; RET; SP174,"guanosine triphosphatase; HRAS protein, human; membrane protein; monoclonal antibody; NRAS protein, human; protein p21; tumor marker; adult; aged; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; dna mutational analysis; female; genetic screening; genetics; human; immunohistochemistry; male; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; middle aged; multiple endocrine neoplasia; polymerase chain reaction; procedures; Thyroid Neoplasms; tissue microarray; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; DNA Mutational Analysis; Female; Genetic Testing; GTP Phosphohydrolases; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Membrane Proteins; Middle Aged; Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization; Thyroid Neoplasms; Tissue Array Analysis; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84987898782

Such decisions may be made difficult by incomplete information, clinical, resourcing or scene challenges and ethical dilemmas. This systematic integrative review identifies all research papers examining resuscitation providers' perspectives on resuscitation decision-making for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients. A total of 14 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria: nine quantitative, four qualitative and one mixed-methods design. Five themes were identified, describing factors informing resuscitation provider decision-making: The arrest event; patient characteristics; the resuscitation scene; resuscitation provider perspectives; and medicolegal concerns. Established prognostic factors are generally considered important, but there is a lack of resuscitation provider consensus on other factors, indicating that decision-making is influenced by the perspective of resuscitation providers themselves. Resuscitation decision-making research typically draws conclusions from evaluation of cardiac arrest registry data or clinical notes, but these may not capture all salient factors. Future research should explore resuscitation provider perspectives to better understand these important decisions and the clinical, ethical, emotional and cognitive demands placed on resuscitation providers. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",cardiopulmonary resuscitation; decision-making; emergency medical services; heart arrest; medical futility; out-of-hospital cardiac arrest; prehospital; systematic review,atrial fibrillation; emotional bias; English (language); ethical decision making; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; medical research; out of hospital cardiac arrest; priority journal; publication; quality control; quality of life; resuscitation; Review; scientific literature; systematic review; treatment outcome; decision making; emergency health service; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; procedures; psychology; resuscitation; treatment withdrawal; Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation; Decision Making; Emergency Medical Services; Humans; Out-of-Hospital Cardiac Arrest; Withholding Treatment,2-s2.0-84965006899

Weakness at these junctions is considered to be an important factor in the aetiology of disc herniations. Methods: Magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of cadaveric lumbar spines were graded for degeneration and motion segments from a range of degenerative grades isolated and bisected sagittally. Following fixation and decalcification, these were cut into segments containing anterior or posterior annulus fibrosus or nucleus pulposus. The segments were cryo-sectioned and sections visualised using both standard light and DIC microscopy. Results: Detachment at the interface between the disc and vertebrae increased with greater degenerative grade (from 1.9?% in Grade I to 28?% in Grade V), especially at the boundary between the cartilage and vertebral endplates. DIC microscopy revealed the fibrous organisation at the IVD–cartilage endplate interface with structural features, such as annular lamellae branching and nodal insertions in the nucleus pulposus region; these have been previously observed in ovine spines, but were less uniform in humans. Structural integrity of the IVD and cartilage endplate was also lost with increasing degeneration. Conclusions: This preliminary study shows that microscopic structural features may act to maintain attachment between the IVD and CEP in the human spine. Loss of structural integrity in this region may destabilise the spine, possibly altering the mechanical environment of the cells in the disc and so potentially contribute to the aetiopathogenesis of IVD degeneration. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Collagen; Degeneration; Differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy; Lamellae branching; Nodal insertions,annulus fibrosus; anterior posterior axis; Article; cartilage; controlled study; differential interference contrast microscopy; human; intervertebral disk; intervertebral disk hernia; lumbar spine; lumbar vertebra; microscopy; musculoskeletal disease assessment; nerve ending; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nucleus pulposus; Pfirrmann degenerative grade; priority journal; spinal cord atrophy; spine radiography; cadaver; cartilage; diagnostic imaging; intervertebral disk; intervertebral disk degeneration; lumbar vertebra; microscopy; pathology; procedures; Cadaver; Cartilage; Humans; Intervertebral Disc; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Lumbar Vertebrae; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Microscopy,2-s2.0-84963738788

Studies suggested that the subtypes of endometrial cancer share many common risk factors. Whether the levels of sex hormones differ between types 1 and 2 endometrial cancer has not been investigated. In this study, levels of estrogen, progesterone, testosterone, follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) were investigated between type 1 and type 2 endometrial cancer taking into account menopausal status and parity. The sex hormones levels and estrogen and progesterone receptors were measured in 187 women with endometrial cancer. The levels of estradiol (E2), progesterone, testosterone, FSH and LH were not different between the subtypes of endometrial cancer regardless of menopausal status. In addition, the sex hormones were not different between patients of different party regardless of the menopausal status. The majority of type 1 (96%) and type 2 (82%) endometrial cancers were estrogen and progesterone receptor positive.

These neurons are involved in a number of cognitive functions including attention, learning and memory. Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (BFCNs) are particularly vulnerable in a number of neurological diseases with the most notable being Alzheimer’s disease, with evidence for a link between decreasing cholinergic markers and the degree of cognitive impairment. The neurotrophin growth factor system is present on these BFCNs and has been shown to promote survival and differentiation on these neurons. Clinical and animal model studies have demonstrated the neuroprotective effects of 17β-estradiol (E2) on neurodegeneration in BFCNs. It is believed that E2 interacts with neurotrophin signaling on cholinergic neurons to mediate these beneficial effects. Evidence presented in our recent study confirms that altering the levels of circulating E2 levels via ovariectomy and E2 replacement significantly affects the expression of the neurotrophin receptors on BFCN. However, we also showed that E2 differentially regulates neurotrophin receptor expression on BFCNs with effects depending on neurotrophin receptor type and neuroanatomical location. In this review, we aim to survey the current literature to understand the influence of E2 on the neurotrophin system, and the receptors and signaling pathways it mediates on BFCN. In addition, we summarize the physiological and pathophysiological significance of E2 actions on the neurotrophin system in BFCN, especially focusing on changes related to Alzheimer’s disease. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Alzheimer’s disease; Basal forebrain cholinergic neurons 4; Estradiol 1; Neurotrophin receptors 3; Neurotrophins 2,"estradiol; estrogen receptor; neurotrophin; neurotrophin receptor; estradiol; nerve growth factor; nerve growth factor receptor; Alzheimer disease; basal forebrain; cell differentiation; cell survival; cholinergic nerve cell; cognitive defect; diagonal band of Broca; human; neuroprotection; neurotransmission; nonhuman; nucleus basalis magnocellularis; protein expression; protein interaction; Review; septum pellucidum; signal transduction; Alzheimer disease; animal; biosynthesis; blood; cholinergic nerve cell; female; male; memory; metabolism; mouse; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Basal Forebrain; Cholinergic Neurons; Cognitive Dysfunction; Estradiol; Female; Humans; Male; Memory; Mice; Nerve Growth Factors; Receptors, Nerve Growth Factor; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85007124095

However, needle phobia, pain, and risks of needle-stick injuries have manifested in poor patient compliance. Needle-free jet injections (NFJI) have been developed to address these drawbacks but the reliability of dose and depth of delivery have been limited by a lack of control over jet parameters, and by variability in the skin's mechanical properties among individuals. Moreover, the device size and cost have been restrained by the high pressure (> 20 MPa) required to penetrate the skin. Needle-assisted jet injections have been proposed to improve delivery reliability of conventional jet injectors by penetrating the skin with a short needle (< 5 mm) and thereby allowing jet delivery to a desired injection depth at a reduced pressure. This study characterized needle-assisted jet injections performed after first penetrating the skin with a 1.5 mm needle, examining the effect of needle size on jet parameters, and evaluating injection performance in porcine skin. A voice-coil actuated jet injector was modified to incorporate needles of 30 G, 31 G and 32 G. A series of pulse tests was performed to compare jet velocity and injection volume across the needle sizes, where it was found that the jet velocity and injection volume achieved with 32 G needles were 13% and 16% lower, respectively, than with 30 G. In contrast, there was no significant difference in jet velocity and injection volume between 30 G and 31 G needles, suggesting that a reduction of 10 μm in the mean inner diameter of the 31 G needle has minimal impact on jet velocity and injection volume. Injection studies performed in porcine skin revealed that injections driven by fluid pressures ranging between 0.8 MPa and 1.4 MPa were able to achieve substantial injectate penetration (~ 10 mm) and delivery (~ 100 μL) into subcutaneous fat regardless of needle size, in a period of 40 ms. The required pressures are an order of magnitude lower than those used in NFJI, yet still maintain the high-speed nature of jet injection by achieving a delivery rate of 2.25 mL/s. The lower pressures required in needle-assisted drug delivery can lead to reduced device size and cost, as well as reduced shear stresses during jet injection and can therefore minimise the potentially adverse effect of shear on the structural integrity of proteins, vaccines and DNA. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Jet injection; Needle-assisted; Transdermal delivery; Voice coil,"Drug delivery; Needles; Shear flow; Shear stress; Velocity; Delivery reliability; Injection performance; Injection studies; Jet injection; Patient compliance; Reduced pressure; Transdermal delivery; Voice coil; Fighter aircraft; polyacrylamide gel; drug; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; drug delivery system; health care cost; hypodermic needle; jet injection; jet injector; needle assisted jet injection; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; shear stress; skin; skin penetration; subcutaneous fat; velocity; animal; comparative study; equipment design; jet injection; metabolism; needle; pig; reproducibility; Animals; Drug Delivery Systems; Equipment Design; Injections, Jet; Needles; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Reproducibility of Results; Skin; Subcutaneous Fat; Swine",2-s2.0-84992643591

The impact of antenatal breastfeeding (BF) education on the duration of BF has not been evaluated. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of antenatal breastfeeding (BF) education for increasing BF initiation and duration. Search methods: We searched Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth's Trials Register on 1 March 2016, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library, 2016, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1966 to 1 March 2016) and Scopus (January 1985 to 1 March 2016). We contacted experts and searched reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria: All identified published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of formal antenatal BF education or comparing two different methods of formal antenatal BF education, on the duration of BF. We included RCTs that only included antenatal interventions and excluded those that combined antenatal and intrapartum or postpartum BF education components. Cluster-randomised trials were included in this review. Quasi-randomised trials were not eligible for inclusion. Data collection and analysis: We assessed all potential studies identified as a result of the search strategy. Two review authors extracted data from each included study using the agreed form and assessed risk of bias. We resolved discrepancies through discussion. We assessed the quality of the evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: This review update includes 24 studies (10,056 women). Twenty studies (9789 women) contribute data to analyses. Most studies took place in high-income countries such as the USA, UK, Canada and Australia. In the first five comparisons, we display the included trials according to type of intervention without pooling data. For the 'Summary of findings' we pooled data for a summary effect. Five included studies were cluster-randomised trials: all of these adjusted data and reported adjustments as odds ratios (OR). We have analysed the data using the generic inverse variance method and presented results as odds ratios, because we were unable to derive a cluster-adjusted risk ratio from the published cluster-trial. We acknowledge that the use of odds ratio prevents the pooling of these cluster trials in our main analyses. One method of BF education with standard (routine) care There were no group differences for duration of any BF in days or weeks. There was no evidence that interventions improved the proportion of women with any BF or exclusive BF at three or six months. Single trials of different interventions were unable to show that education improved initiation of BF, apart from one small trial at high risk of attrition bias. Many trial results marginally favoured the intervention but had wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect. BF complications such as mastitis and other BF problems were similar in treatment arms in single trials reporting these outcomes. Multiple methods of BF education versus standard care For all trials included in this comparison we have presented the cluster-adjusted odds ratios as reported in trial publications. One three-arm study found the intervention of BF booklet plus video plus Lactation Consultant versus standard care improved the proportion of women exclusively BF at three months (OR 2.60, 95% CI 1.25 to 5.40; women = 159) and marginally at six months (OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.00 to 5.76; women = 175). For the same trial, an intervention arm without a lactation consultant but with the BF booklet and video did not have the same effect on proportion of women exclusively BF at three months (OR 1.80, 95% CI 0.80 to 4.05; women = 159) or six months (OR 0.90, 95% CI 0.30 to 2.70; women = 184). One study compared monthly BF sessions and weekly cell phone message versus standard care and reported improvements in the proportion of women exclusively BF at both three and six months (three months OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.10 to 2.95; women = 390; six months OR 2.40, 95% CI 1.40 to 4.11; women = 390). One study found monthly BF sessions and weekly cell phone messages improved initiation of BF over standard care (OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.61 to 4.24; women = 380). BF education session versus standard care, pooled analyses for 'Summary of findings' (SoF) This comparison does not include cluster-randomised trials reporting adjusted odds ratios. We did not downgrade any evidence for trials' lack of blinding; no trial had adequate blinding of staff and participants. The SoF table presents risk ratios for all outcomes analysed. For proportion of women exclusively BF there is no evidence that antenatal BF education improved BF at three months (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.25; women = 822; studies = 3; moderate quality evidence) or at six months (RR 1.07, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.30; women = 2161; studies = 4; moderate quality evidence). For proportion of women with any BF there were no group differences in BF at three (average RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.18; women = 654; studies = 2; I2 = 60%; low-quality evidence) or six months (average RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.23; women = 1636; studies = 4; I2 = 61%; high-quality evidence). There was no evidence that antenatal BF education could improve initiation of BF (average RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.09; women = 3505; studies = 8; I2 = 69%; high-quality evidence). Where we downgraded evidence this was due to small sample size or wide confidence intervals crossing the line of no effect, or both. There was insufficient data for subgroup analysis of mother's occupation or education. Authors' conclusions: There was no conclusive evidence supporting any antenatal BF education for improving initiation of BF, proportion of women giving any BF or exclusively BF at three or six months or the duration of BF. There is an urgent need to conduct a high-quality, randomised controlled study to evaluate the effectiveness and adverse effects of antenatal BF education, especially in low- and middle-income countries.

Although recent literature has described a link between ailments such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer and a protective effect of polyphenols in the OLE, the mode of action is still unclear. Here, we describe a double-blinded placebo (PBO)-controlled trial, in which gene expression profiles of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy male volunteers (n = 29) were analysed to identify genes that responded to OLE, following an eight-week intervention with 20 mL daily consumption of either OLE or PBO. Differences between groups were determined using an adjusted linear model. Subsequent analyses indicated downregulation of genes important in inflammatory pathways, lipid metabolism and cancer as a result of OLE consumption. Gene expression was verified by real-time PCR for three genes (EGR1, COX-2 and ID3). The results presented here suggest that OLE consumption may result in health benefits through influencing the expression of genes in inflammatory and metabolic pathways. Future studies with a larger study group, including male and female participants, looking into direct effects of OLE on lipid metabolism and inflammation are warranted. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Inflammation; Nutraceutical; Polyphenols; Transcriptomics,"antiinflammatory agent; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor; early growth response factor 1; early growth response factor 2; heparin binding epidermal growth factor; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; inhibitor of differentiation 3; interleukin 8; kruppel like factor; macrophage migration inhibition factor; mesodermal growth factor; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; Ndc80 complex; nuclear receptor related factor 1; nucleosome assembly protein 1; olive leaf extract; oncostatin M; placebo; plant extract; polyphenol; prostaglandin synthase; unclassified drug; messenger RNA; plant extract; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cyclooxygenase 2 gene; double blind procedure; early growth response 1 gene; enzyme induction; gene; gene expression; gene ontology; human; inhibitor of differentiation 3 gene; intervention study; lipid metabolism; male; microarray analysis; nutritional assessment; olive; patient compliance; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; protein analysis; quality control; randomized controlled trial; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; treatment outcome; chemistry; controlled study; dietary supplement; DNA microarray; drug effects; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; innate immunity; metabolism; molecular genetics; mononuclear cell; olive tree; plant leaf; reproducibility; Dietary Supplements; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Ontology; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Male; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Olea; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Placebos; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reproducibility of Results; RNA, Messenger; Transcription, Genetic",2-s2.0-85003819834

We used a point process model to investigate this association using information that included tumor localization data from the INTERPHONE Study (Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, and the United Kingdom). Our main analysis included 792 regular mobile phone users diagnosed with a glioma between 2000 and 2004. Similar to earlier results, we found a statistically significant association between the intracranial distribution of gliomas and the selfreported location of the phone. When we accounted for the preferred side of the head not being exclusively used for all mobile phone calls, the results were similar. The association was independent of the cumulative call time and cumulative number of calls. However, our model used reported side of mobile phone use, which is potentially influenced by recall bias. The point process method provides an alternative to previously used epidemiologic research designs when one is including localization in the investigation of brain tumors and mobile phone use. ?

Current treatment involves frequent intravitreal administration of corticosteroids such as dexamethasone. The aim of this research was to formulate an electrically controlled delivery system for dexamethasone. Polypyrrole (PPy) was polymerized with dexamethasone sodium phosphate (Dex-P) through two approaches. Firstly, conventional films (CFs) of PPy were electropolymerized by applying a constant current density of 2?mA/cm2 for 4?min. Secondly, for the first time, we report drug-loaded ethanol-washed films (EWFs). EWFs were prepared in the same manner as CFs, except ethanol washing steps were introduced in the middle and at the end of PPy electropolymerization. The ethanol washing removed unbound PPy oligomers resulting in the formation of smooth surfaces with two distinct layers when viewed in cross-section. The EWFs showed superior electrochemical activity compared to CFs. Sustained release was observed from both CFs and EWFs with bursts of release triggered by electrical stimulation. The EWFs were initially more responsive to the electrical trigger, offering future opportunities to fine tune release. The cytotoxicity of aqueous extracts collected from both films was evaluated on human adult retinal pigment epithelium (ARPE-19) cells using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay with negligible toxicity observed. The results suggest PPy-Dex-P films are highly suitable for the development of electro-responsive implants for the treatment of AMD and DME. ? 2016, Controlled Release Society.",Conducting polymer; Electrically triggered release; Ocular implant; Sequential polymerization; Smart materials; Solvent washing,dexamethasone sodium phosphate; monomer; oligomer; polypyrrole; delayed release formulation; dexamethasone; polymer; polypyrrole; pyrrole derivative; adult; age related macular degeneration; Article; cell viability; controlled study; cyclic potentiometry; cytotoxicity; diabetic macular edema; drug release; electrostimulation; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; limit of quantitation; polymerization; priority journal; retina pigment cell; retinal pigment epithelium; scanning electron microscopy; sustained drug release; ultraviolet spectroscopy; administration and dosage; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; delayed release formulation; drug delivery system; drug effects; drug release; electrochemistry; macular degeneration; macular edema; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Delayed-Action Preparations; Dexamethasone; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Electrochemistry; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Macular Edema; Polymerization; Polymers; Pyrroles,2-s2.0-85014028318

AIM: To update an earlier Cochrane review on the effectiveness of antidepressants in primary care to include newer antidepressant classes, and to examine the efficacy of individual agents. METHODS: Selection criteria included antidepressant studies with a randomly assigned placebo group where half or more subjects were recruited from primary care. The Cochrane Collaboration Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis (CCDAN) group searched multiple databases to identify eligible studies. Data extraction was performed independently by two reviewers. Data were analysed using Revman version 5.3.5. RESULTS:? In total, 17 papers and 22 comparisons were included for analysis. Significant benefits in terms of response were found for tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) with a relative risk (RR) = 1.23 (95% CI, 1.01-1.48), and serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) with a RR = 1.33 (95% CI, 1.20-1.48). Mianserin was effective for continuous outcomes. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) for TCA = 8.5; SSRI = 6.5; and venlafaxine = 6. Most studies were industry-funded and of a brief duration (? 8 weeks). There was evidence of publication bias. There were no studies comparing newer antidepressants against placebo. CONCLUSION: Antidepressants such as TCA, SSRI, SNRI (serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and NaSSA (noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant) classes appear to be effective in primary care when compared with placebo. However, in view of the potential for publication bias and that only four studies were not funded by industry, caution is needed when considering their use in primary care. ?

We first examine the role of social modeling in influencing treatment outcomes through modifying placebo and nocebo responses, and then explore possible mechanisms for these effects. Viewing another person show improvement after taking a drug can increase the placebo component of the medicine and thus the overall potency of the treatment. Likewise, seeing another person who has taken the same medicine report side effects can substantially increase adverse effects. Such effects can also occur on a wider scale following changes in medicine formulations or from vaccinations programs, when the media transmit adverse effects from these treatments to a wider audience. Females seem to be more susceptible than males to the social modeling of adverse effects of treatments. A greater awareness of the effects of social modeling has potential to improve the effectiveness of medical treatments, minimize side-effect burden, and also lead to more effective management of health scares. ? 2016, ?

On the basis of fiber connections in pigeons, however, we previously proposed that the dorsomedial subdivision (DM) and the V-shaped layer of the hippocampal formation correspond to Ammon's horn and the dentate gyrus of mammals, respectively. In the present study, we provide evidence in support of this hypothesis by double staining hippocampal neurons using tract-tracing and gene expression. After cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the lateral septal nucleus (SL), and vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (vGluT2) mRNA, a gene marker for glutamatergic neurons, was visualized in the same retrogradely labeled neurons with in situ hybridization, most CTB+/vGluT2+ neurons were concentrated in DM, but were rare in the V-shaped layer. The distribution pattern of CTB+/vGluT2+ neurons in the hippocampal formation did not change when CTB injection sites were shifted in a rostrocaudal direction in SL. SL expresses a variety of mRNAs for ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits (GluA1, GluA2, GluK2, GluK4, and GluN1). The findings indicate that DM neurons provide descending glutamatergic axons to SL. Additionally, the present study showed that Prox1 mRNA, a gene marker for the dentate gyrus in mammals, was intensely expressed in the V-shaped layer in the pigeon hippocampus. Together these results strengthen our original hypothesis that DM and the V-shaped layer in the pigeon hippocampus are homologous to Ammon's Horn and the dentate gyrus, respectively. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",bird; cholera toxin subunit B; lateral septum; Prox1; vesicular glutamate transporter 2,"cholera toxin B subunit; ionotropic receptor; messenger RNA; vesicular glutamate transporter 2; avian protein; cholera toxin; glutamate receptor; glutamic acid; homeodomain protein; neuronal tract tracer; adult; animal cell; Article; axon; controlled study; dentate gyrus; dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus; female; gene expression; glutamatergic neuron; hippocampus; horn; in situ hybridization; injection site; male; marker gene; nerve cell; nonhuman; priority journal; septum nucleus; staining; anatomy and histology; animal; Columbidae; cytology; hippocampus; immunohistochemistry; metabolism; neuroanatomical tract tracing; species difference; Animals; Avian Proteins; Cholera Toxin; Columbidae; Female; Glutamic Acid; Hippocampus; Homeodomain Proteins; Immunohistochemistry; In Situ Hybridization; Male; Neuroanatomical Tract-Tracing Techniques; Neuronal Tract-Tracers; Neurons; Receptors, Glutamate; Species Specificity; Vesicular Glutamate Transport Protein 2",2-s2.0-84994751922

Methods: Participants were residents of a semi-rural region of New Zealand (NZ). Eligibility was defined by a body mass index (BMI) of ?98th percentile or >91st centile with weight-related comorbidities. Fasting blood, medical and physical assessments were obtained. Results: During the recruitment period from January 2012 to August 2014, 239 participants, aged 4.8–16.8 years, undertook assessment. Average BMI standard deviation score was 3.09 (standard deviation (SD) = 0.60, range 1.52–5.34 SD). The majority of participants were of either Maori (NZ’s indigenous people (45%)) or NZ European (45%) ethnicity; 29% of participants were from the most deprived quintile of household deprivation. Maori participants were more likely than NZ Europeans to have a mother who smoked during pregnancy (52% vs. 28%, P = 0.001), a family history of type 2 diabetes (66% vs. 53%, P = 0.04), acanthosis nigricans on examination (58% vs. 20%, P < 0.0001), a low serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (27% vs. 14%, P = 0.03) or high serum triglyceride (38% vs. 24%, P = 0.03) concentration. Conclusion: The unique aspect of this study was the ability to recruit high levels of Maori participants and those from most deprived areas, indicating a high level of acceptability for these target groups. Comorbidities were prevalent in this cohort of overweight/obese school-aged children. While there were some differences in comorbidity prevalence between Maori and NZ Europeans, the overall clinical picture in our cohort, irrespective of ethnicity, was of concern. ? 2016 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",adolescent; comorbidity; Indigenous population; New Zealand; pediatric obesity,"glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; acanthosis nigricans; adolescent; adolescent obesity; Article; body mass; child; childhood obesity; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; European; female; glucose blood level; health program; human; indigenous people; male; Maori (people); maternal smoking; New Zealand; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pregnancy; prevalence; priority journal; rural area; triacylglycerol blood level; community care; comorbidity; obesity; physical examination; preschool child; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Community Networks; Comorbidity; Humans; New Zealand; Obesity; Physical Examination; Prevalence",2-s2.0-84992539302

Methods: Women answered PA and SB (sitting time and television time) interview questions and self-completed the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) questionnaires, at week 26–28 gestation. Sufficient levels of PA (?600MET-minutes/week) and higher sitting time (?7?h/day) were determined. Associations of PA and SB with probable antenatal depression (EPDS-score ?15), higher state anxiety (score ?42), and higher trait anxiety (score ?43) were determined by logistic regression analysis. Results: Among the 1144 pregnant women included in the study, 7.3, 22.5, and 23.6?% had probable antenatal depression, higher state anxiety, and higher trait anxiety symptoms, respectively. In the adjusted models, women with sufficient level of PA were less likely to have probable antenatal depression (OR 0.54, 95?% CI 0.31–0.94, p = 0.030) and higher trait anxiety symptoms (OR 0.68, 95?% CI 0.48–0.94, p = 0.022). PA was not associated with state anxiety symptoms. SB was not associated with any of the investigated outcomes. Conclusions: Sufficient PA was associated with a reduced likelihood of probable antenatal depression and trait anxiety symptoms. Further investigation of these findings is warranted to determine cause-effect relationships and identify potential preventive strategies. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.",Anxiety; Depression; Physical activity; Pregnancy; Sedentary behavior,"adult; anxiety disorder; Article; Chinese; cohort analysis; depression; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; ethnic difference; female; human; Indian; interview; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; Malay (people); physical activity; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prenatal period; priority journal; psychological well-being; sedentary lifestyle; sitting; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; anxiety; anxiety assessment; depression; exercise; pathophysiology; pregnancy; psychological interview; psychological rating scale; psychology; statistical model; Adult; Anxiety; Depression; Exercise; Female; Humans; Interview, Psychological; Logistic Models; Pregnancy; Pregnant Women; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Sedentary Lifestyle; Test Anxiety Scale",2-s2.0-84988699888

Results: Chow-fed Alb-Cre;Gpx1lox/lox mice did not exhibit any alterations in body composition or energy expenditure, but had improved insulin sensitivity and reduced fasting blood glucose. This was accompanied by decreased gluconeogenic and increased glycolytic gene expression as well as increased hepatic glycogen. Hepatic insulin receptor Y1163/Y1163 phosphorylation and Akt Ser-473 phosphorylation were increased in fasted chow-fed Alb-Cre;Gpx1lox/lox mice, associated with increased H2O2 production and insulin signalling in isolated hepatocytes. The enhanced insulin signalling was accompanied by the increased oxidation of hepatic protein tyrosine phosphatases previously implicated in the attenuation of insulin signalling. High-fat-fed Alb-Cre;Gpx1lox/lox mice did not exhibit alterations in weight gain or hepatosteatosis, but exhibited decreased hepatic inflammation, decreased gluconeogenic gene expression and increased insulin signalling in the liver. Alb-Cre;Gpx1lox/lox mice fed a CDAA diet that promotes non-alcoholic steatohepatitis exhibited decreased hepatic lymphocytic infiltrates, inflammation and liver fibrosis. Conclusions/interpretation: Increased hepatocyte-derived H2O2 enhances hepatic insulin signalling, improves glucose control and protects mice from the development of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Fibrosis; Glutathione peroxidase-1; Hepatocyte; Inflammation; Insulin resistance; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis; Protein tyrosine phosphatase; Reactive oxygen species; Type 2 diabetes,"glucose; glutathione peroxidase 1; hydrogen peroxide; insulin; protein tyrosine phosphatase; glucose; glutathione peroxidase; glutathione peroxidase 1; hydrogen peroxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body composition; choline deficient amino acid defined diet; controlled study; diet; energy expenditure; enzyme deficiency; gene deletion; gene expression; gluconeogenesis; glucose blood level; glucose homeostasis; glucose metabolism; glycogen liver level; hepatitis; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; liver cell; mouse; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; obesity; oxidation; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; tissue homogenate; allele; animal; C57BL mouse; deficiency; enzymology; fatty liver; genetics; insulin resistance; knockout mouse; liver; liver cell; male; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; pathology; physiology; polymerase chain reaction; Alleles; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Fatty Liver; Glucose; Glutathione Peroxidase; Hepatocytes; Hydrogen Peroxide; Insulin Resistance; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatases; Reactive Oxygen Species",2-s2.0-84988422006

However, studies have not directly tested whether vmHRV is associated with the ability to facially express emotions. In extending prior work, the current report tested links between resting vmHRV and the objectively assessed ability to facially express emotions, hypothesizing that higher vmHRV would predict greater expressive skill. Eighty healthy women completed self-reported measures, before attending a laboratory session in which vmHRV and the ability to express six emotions in the face were assessed. A repeated measures analysis of variance revealed a marginal main effect for vmHRV on skill overall; individuals with higher resting vmHRV were only better able to deliberately facially express anger and interest. Findings suggest that differences in resting vmHRV are associated with the objectively assessed ability to facially express some, but not all, emotions, with potential implications for health and well-being. ? 2016 Society for Psychophysiological Research",Emotion; Emotion regulation; Expressive skill; Health; Heart rate variability,adolescent; adult; emotion; facial expression; female; heart; heart rate; human; innervation; physiology; vagus nerve; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Emotions; Facial Expression; Female; Heart; Heart Rate; Humans; Vagus Nerve; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84983527071

However, rising antibiotic resistance has raised concerns over the adequacy of conventional prophylaxis. This study aimed to identify organisms causing PJIs in hip and knee arthroplasty secondary to perioperative contamination and their susceptibility to current prophylactic antibiotics. Methods: We performed a retrospective audit of 4009 primary hip and knee arthroplasties (1852 hips and 2157 knees) at three tertiary referral hospitals. PJIs were identified according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America definition, and patients were followed-up for 2 years. For patients with confirmed PJIs, causative bacteria and their antibiotic susceptibilities were identified. Results: Thirty-five PJI cases were identified (13 hips and 22 knees). The overall definite PJI rate was 0.87% (0.7% for hips, 1.0% for knees). Ninety-six percent of patients with PJI received cefazolin prophylaxis. Culture information was available for 30 cases. The most common infecting organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), causing 35% of infections. Ninety-two percent of CoNS strains were cefazolin-resistant. Twenty-five percent of patients were infected with Staphylococcus aureus, 9.1% of which were methicillin-resistant. Overall, 53% of infecting organisms were cefazolin-resistant. Conclusions: The majority of bacteria causing early PJI are resistant to cefazolin. Whilst many organisms cultured were susceptible to vancomycin, there is currently insufficient evidence to justify its routine use as a prophylactic. However, when treating PJI in the early postoperative period, surgeons should be aware that most organisms will be methicillin-resistant, and the choice of empirical antibiotic treatment should reflect this. ? 2016 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons",antibiotic prophylaxis; arthroplasty; cephalosporin resistance,"antiinfective agent; adverse effects; aged; antibiotic prophylaxis; antibiotic resistance; clinical trial; female; follow up; hip prosthesis; human; isolation and purification; knee prosthesis; male; microbiology; multicenter study; procedures; Prosthesis-Related Infections; retrospective study; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; time factor; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Drug Resistance, Microbial; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hip Prosthesis; Humans; Knee Prosthesis; Male; Prosthesis-Related Infections; Retrospective Studies; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84983410681

There is a need to refine stimulation protocols for clinical benefit, but a lack of accurate techniques for assessing mechanisms in clinical trials, such as slow wave modulation, has hindered progress. We thereby aimed to assess acute slow wave responses to GES in gastroparesis patients using high-resolution (HR) (multi-electrode) mapping, across a range of stimulation doses achievable by the Enterra stimulation device (Medtronic Inc., MN, USA). Materials and Methods: Patients with medically refractory gastroparesis (n = 8) undergoing device implantation underwent intraoperative HR mapping (256 electrodes). Baseline recordings were followed by four protocols of increasing stimulation intensity, with washout periods. Slow wave patterns, frequency, velocity, amplitude, and dysrhythmia rates were quantified by investigators blinded to stimulation settings. Results: There was no difference in slow wave pattern, frequency, velocity, or amplitude between baseline, washout, and stimulation periods (all p > 0.5). Dysrhythmias included ectopic pacemakers, conduction blocks, retrograde propagation, and colliding wavefronts, and dysrhythmia rates were unchanged with stimulation off vs. on (31% vs. 36% duration dysrhythmic; p > 0.5). Symptom scores and gastric emptying were improved at 5.8 month follow-up (p < 0.05). Conclusions: High-frequency GES protocols achievable from a current commercial device did not acutely modulate slow wave activity or dysrhythmias. This study advances clinical methods for identifying and assessing therapeutic GES parameters, and can be applied in future studies on higher-energy protocols and devices. ? 2016 International Neuromodulation Society",Diabetes mellitus; electrophysiology; high-resolution mapping; pacing; slow wave,"acute slow wave response; adult; Article; clinical article; electrode implant; electrophysiology parameters; electrostimulation; female; follow up; gastric pacemaker; high frequency electrotherapy; high resolution mapping; high-frequency gastric electrical stimulation; human; male; middle aged; scoring system; stomach emptying; stomach paresis; treatment response; biophysics; electrotherapy; Gastroparesis; manometry; physiology; procedures; treatment outcome; Adult; Biophysics; Electric Stimulation Therapy; Electrodes, Implanted; Female; Gastric Emptying; Gastroparesis; Humans; Male; Manometry; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84977472402

This is important to identify the characteristics of participants who are at most risk of treatment burden. Objective: The aim of this study is to identify the characteristics of participants who are at most risk of treatment burden. Methods: This cross-sectional study was part of a larger project and recruitment was conducted across four Australian regions: rural, semi-rural and metropolitan. Participants were asked about their treatment burden using an adapted version of a measure, which included the following five dimensions: medication, time and administrative, lifestyle change, social life and financial burden. Results: In total, 581 participants with various chronic health conditions reported a mean global treatment burden of 56.5 out of 150 (standard deviation?=?34.5). Number of chronic conditions (β?=?.34, p?<?0.01), age, (β?=??.27, p?<?0.01), the presence of an unpaid carer (β?=?.22, p?<?0.001) and the presence of diabetes mellitus and other endocrine conditions (β?=?.13, p?<?0.01) were significant predictors of overall treatment burden. For the five dimensions of treatment burden, social, medicine and administrative burden were predicted by the same cluster of variables: number of conditions, age, presence of an unpaid carer and diabetes. However, in addition to these variables, financial dimensions were also predicted by education level, ethnicity and health insurance. Educational level also influenced lifestyle burden. Conclusion: A substantial proportion of community-dwelling adults with chronic conditions have considerable levels of treatment burden. Specifically, health professionals should provide greater focus on managing overall treatment burden for persons who are of young age, have an endocrine condition or an unpaid carer, or a combination of these factors. ? 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",,adult; age; Article; caregiver; chronic disease; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; education; endocrine disease; ethnicity; female; health care financing; health insurance; health practitioner; high risk patient; human; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; social life; Australia; chronic disease; cost of illness; risk; Australia; Caregivers; Chronic Disease; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Risk,2-s2.0-84965047350

It has a complex structure, and alterations to this structure across spatial scales are associated with several pregnancy complications, including intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The relationship between placental structure and its efficiency as an oxygen exchanger is not well understood in normal or pathological pregnancies. Here we present a computational framework that predicts oxygen transport in the placenta which accounts for blood and oxygen transport in the space around a placental functional unit (the villous tree). The model includes the well-defined branching structure of the largest villous tree branches, as well as a smoothed representation of the small terminal villi that comprise the placenta's gas exchange interfaces. The model demonstrates that oxygen exchange is sensitive to villous tree geometry, including the villous branch length and volume, which are seen to change in IUGR. This is because, to be an efficient exchanger, the architecture of the villous tree must provide a balance between maximising the surface area available for exchange, and the opposing condition of allowing sufficient maternal blood flow to penetrate into the space surrounding the tree. The model also predicts an optimum oxygen exchange when the branch angle is 24 °, as villous branches and TBs are spread out sufficiently to channel maternal blood flow deep into the placental tissue for oxygen exchange without being shunted directly into the DVs. Without concurrent change in the branch length and angles, the model predicts that the number of branching generations has a small influence on oxygen exchange. The modelling framework is presented in 2D for simplicity but is extendible to 3D or to incorporate the high-resolution imaging data that is currently evolving to better quantify placental structure. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Computational model; Gas exchange; Intervillous blood flow; Placenta; Placental structure,"blood; imaging method; modeling; oxygen; pregnancy; transport process; Article; blood flow; decidua; decidual vein; gas exchange; geometry; intrauterine growth retardation; maternal blood; mathematical model; oxygen consumption; oxygen transport; parameters concerning the fetus, newborn and pregnancy; placenta; placenta circulation; placenta tissue; placental transfer; placental villous tree; prediction; priority journal; structure analysis; surface area; vein; villous branch angle; villous branch length; villous branch volume; anatomy and histology; animal; biological model; chorion villus; female; fetomaternal transfusion; human; mammal; metabolism; physiology; placenta; pregnancy; vascularization; oxygen; Animals; Chorionic Villi; Female; Humans; Mammals; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Models, Biological; Oxygen; Placenta; Pregnancy",2-s2.0-84982803664

Assessment of pain in CP is required for clinical management and clinical studies. International consensus guidelines recognized a lack of specific and validated pain assessment tools for CP. Therefore, the aim of this systematic review is to identify and compare all clinical studies that assessed pain in the context of a treatment for pain in CP. Methods A systematic literature search was performed in PubMed, Cochrane Library and Ovid MEDLINE. The search identified all intervention studies for pain in CP and the pain assessment tools used based on pre-defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results Of 341 articles identified, 137 studies were included. Pain assessment tools were both general and CP-specific. The latter were used in only 22 (16%) studies. Despite recommendations the aspects of pain assessed were limited and variable between tools. Validation of these tools in CP patients was limited to quality of life measures. None of the pain assessment tools evaluated duration of pain and postprandial pain. Conclusions There are no published pain assessment tools for CP that includes all relevant aspects of pain. There is the need to develop a comprehensive and validated pain assessment tool for patients with CP to standardised pain assessment, identify likely underlying pain mechanisms, help select appropriate treatments, report outcomes from interventions, improve clinical communication and aid the allocation of patients to clinical trials. ? 2016 IAP and EPC",Central sensitisation; Chronic pain; Neuropathic pain; Pain evaluation; Pain management,"abdominal pain; chronic pancreatitis; disease duration; human; instrument validation; intermethod comparison; pain assessment; postprandial state; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; analgesia; chronic pancreatitis; comparative study; complication; pain; pain measurement; procedures; Humans; Pain; Pain Management; Pain Measurement; Pancreatitis, Chronic",2-s2.0-84999635270

Methods: An expert panel of physical activity (PA) researchers collated and reviewed available nationally representative survey data between March and May 2016. In the absence of new data, (2014-2016) regional level data were used to inform the direction of existing grades. Grades were assigned based on the percentage of children and youth meeting each indicator: A is 81% to 100%; B is 61% to 80%; C is 41% to 60%, D is 21% to 40%; F is 0% to 20%; INC is Incomplete data. Results: Overall PA, Active Play, and Government Initiatives were graded B-; Community Environments was graded B; Sport Participation and School Environment received a C+; Sedentary Behaviors and Family/Peer Support were graded C; and Active Travel was graded C-. Conclusions: Overall PA participation was satisfactory for young children but not for youth.

Methods: Baseline dietary intake and eating behaviour records were assessed from those enrolled in a clinical unblinded randomised controlled trial of a multi-disciplinary intervention. The setting was a community-based obesity programme in Taranaki, New Zealand. Children or adolescents who were enrolled from January 2012 to August 2014, with a BMI ?98th percentile or &gt;91st centile with weight-related comorbidities were eligible. Results: 239 participants (45% Ma?ri, 45% NZ Europeans, 10% other ethnicities), aged 5-17 years were assessed. Two-thirds of participants experienced hyperphagia and half were not satiated after a meal. Comfort eating was reported by 62% of participants, and daily energy intake was above the recommended guidelines for 54%. Fruit and vegetable intake was suboptimal compared with the recommended 5 servings per day (mean 3.5 [SD = 1.9] servings per day), and the mean weekly breakfasts were less than the national average (5.9 vs 6.5; p&lt;0.0001). Median sweet drink intake amongst Ma?ri was twice that of NZ Europeans (250 vs 125 ml per day; p = 0.0002). Conclusions: There was a concerning prevalence of abnormal eating behaviours and significant differences in dietary intake between obese participants and their national counterparts. Ethnic differences between Indigenous and non-Indigenous participants were also present, especially in relation to sweet drink consumption. Eating behaviours, especially sweet drink consumption and fruit/vegetable intake need to be addressed. ? 2016 Anderson et al.

Design Cohort study. Methods One observer assessed the clinical data of 500 consecutive cases, prior to phacoemulsification cataract surgery performed between April and June 2015 at Greenlane Clinical Centre, Auckland, New Zealand. Preoperatively 2 risk scores were calculated for each case using the Muhtaseb and Buckinghamshire risk stratification systems. Complications, intraoperative and postoperative, and visual outcomes were analyzed in relation to these risk scores. Results Intraoperative complication rates increased with higher risk scores using the Muhtaseb or Buckinghamshire stratification system (P = .001 and P = .003, respectively, n = 500). The odds ratios for residents and fellows were not significantly different from attending physicians after case-mix adjustment according to risk scores (P > .05). Postoperative complication rates increased with higher Buckinghamshire risk scores but not with Muhtaseb scores (P = .014 and P = .094, respectively, n = 476). Postoperative corrected-distance visual acuity was poorer with higher risk scores (P < .001 for both, n = 476). Conclusion This study confirms that the risk of intraoperative complications increases with higher preoperative risk scores. Furthermore, higher risk scores correlate with poorer postoperative visual acuity and the Buckinghamshire risk score also correlates with postoperative complications. Therefore, preoperative assessment using such risk stratification systems could assist individual informed consent, preoperative surgical planning, safe allocation of cases to trainees, and more meaningful analyses of outcomes for individual surgeons and institutions. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"doxazosin; tamsulosin; adolescent; adult; age; aged; anterior eye chamber depth; Article; Buckinghamshire risk stratification system; case mix; cataract; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; congenital cornea dystrophy; cornea injury; corrected distance visual acuity; diabetic retinopathy; disease assessment; eye axis length; female; human; hypermetropia; lens disease; major clinical study; male; Muhtaseb risk stratification system; myopia; New Zealand; observational study; peroperative complication; phacodonesis; phacoemulsification; postoperative complication; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; prospective study; pseudoexfoliation; public hospital; pupil disease; resident; risk assessment; surgeon; surgical risk; teaching hospital; very elderly; vision; vitrectomy; adverse effects; cataract; clinical competence; education; follow up; Intraoperative Complications; medical education; middle aged; ophthalmology; phacoemulsification; preoperative period; procedures; retrospective study; risk factor; teaching hospital; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cataract; Clinical Competence; Education, Medical, Graduate; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Internship and Residency; Intraoperative Complications; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Ophthalmology; Phacoemulsification; Preoperative Period; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84995743405

Research points to the potential of lifestyle improvement for the population-level prevention of mental disorders. However, most studies examine single relationships without considering the combined contribution of lifestyle factors to variance in depression. This study examined associations between adolescent diet, physical activity and screen time behaviours and depressive symptomatology. Methods: A cross-sectional sample of year 8 and 10 students was recruited from 23 participating schools in 18 Victorian communities. Students were recruited using opt-out consent, resulting in 3295 participants from 4680 registered school enrolments (Participation Rate: 70.4%). Participants completed a supervised self-report questionnaire comprising Moods and Feelings Questionnaire-Short Form, an assessment of physical activity and sedentary behaviours during and outside school, and weekly food intake. Surveyed covariates included hours of sleep per night, age, socio-economic status and measured anthropometry. A hierarchical regression stratified by gender was conducted, with dichotomised Moods and Feelings Questionnaire-Short Form score as the outcome, and screen time, physical activity and dietary patterns as predictors. Nested regression analyses were then conducted to ascertain the variance in Moods and Feelings Questionnaire-Short Form score attributable to each significant predictor from the initial regression. Results: Increased scores on an unhealthy dietary pattern (odds ratio = 1.18; 95% confidence interval = [1.07, 1.32]) and physical activity guideline attainment (0.91; [0.85, 0.97]) were associated with depressive symptomatology in males, while screen time guideline attainment (0.95; [0.91, 0.98]) was associated with depression in females. No association was observed between healthy diet pattern and Moods and Feelings Questionnaire-Short Form. Overall, effect sizes were generally small, and the regression model accounted for 5.22% of Moods and Feelings Questionnaire-Short Form variance. Conclusion: Gender-specific associations were observed between physical activity and both sedentary and dietary behaviours and depressive symptomatology among adolescents, although reverse causality cannot be refuted at this stage. Lifestyle behaviours may represent a modifiable target for the prevention of depressive symptomatology in adolescents. ?

Methods Self-reported data based on the EQ-5D standardized measure of health status were collected from 29 770 participants in the Injury-VIBES injury cohort study, which covered Australia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America. The data were combined to calculate new disability weights for each common injury classification and for each type of diagnosis covered by the 10th revision of the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems. Weights were calculated separately for hospital admissions and presentations confined to emergency departments. Findings There were 29 770 injury cases with at least one EQ-5D score. The mean age of the participants providing data was 51 years. Most participants were male and almost a third had road traffic injuries. The new disability weights were higher for admitted cases than for cases confined to emergency departments and higher than the corresponding weights used by the Global Burden of Disease 2013 study. Long-term disability was common in most categories of injuries. Conclusion Injury is often a chronic disorder and burden of disease estimates should reflect this. Application of the new weights to burden studies would substantially increase estimates of disability-adjusted life-years and provide a more accurate reflection of the impact of injuries on peoples’ lives. ? 2016, World Health Organization.

Given the majority of endometrial cancer occurs in postmenopausal women, it has not been widely recognized that?obesity is a significant risk factor for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer in young, symptomatic, premenopausal women. Objective We sought to evaluate the effect of body mass index on risk of endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding. Study Design This was a retrospective cohort study in a single large?urban secondary women's health service. Participants were 916 premenopausal women referred for abnormal uterine bleeding of any cause and had an endometrial biopsy from 2008 through 2014. The primary outcome was complex endometrial hyperplasia (with or without atypia) or endometrial cancer. Results Almost 5% of participants had complex endometrial hyperplasia or cancer. After adjusting for clinical and demographic factors, women with a measured body mass index ?30 kg/m2 were 4 times more likely to develop complex hyperplasia or cancer (95% confidence interval, 1.36–11.74). Other risk factors were nulliparity (adjusted odds ratio, 3.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.43–6.64) and anemia (adjusted odds ratio, 2.23; 95% confidence interval, 1.14–4.35). Age, diabetes, and menstrual history were not significant. Conclusion Obesity is an important risk factor for complex endometrial hyperplasia or cancer in premenopausal women with abnormal uterine bleeding who had an endometrial biopsy in a secondary gynecology service. As over half of women with the outcome in this study were age &lt;45 years, deciding to biopsy primarily based on age, as currently recommended in national guidelines, potentially misses many cases or delays diagnosis. Body mass index should be the first stratification in the decision to perform endometrial biopsy and/or to refer secondary gynecology services. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",biopsy; endometrial hyperplasia; endometrial neoplasms; menorrhagia; menstruation disturbances; obesity; premenopause,adult; age; anemia; Article; biopsy device; body mass; cancer risk; clinical decision making; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; endometrium biopsy; endometrium cancer; endometrium hyperplasia; female; human; human tissue; major clinical study; medical history; menstrual cycle; middle aged; nullipara; obesity; patient referral; premenopause; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; treatment outcome; uterus bleeding; age; biopsy; body mass; complication; Endometrial Hyperplasia; Endometrial Neoplasms; endometrium; New Zealand; obesity; pathology; Uterine Hemorrhage; Adult; Age Factors; Biopsy; Body Mass Index; Clinical Decision-Making; Cohort Studies; Endometrial Hyperplasia; Endometrial Neoplasms; Endometrium; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Obesity; Premenopause; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Uterine Hemorrhage,2-s2.0-84994462148

Accepted blood pressures reported in standard charts for healthy awake children may not apply to those undergoing anesthesia. Aim: Our goal was to define observed blood pressures (BP) and heart rate (HR) in children 0–5 years during anesthesia. Methods: Data from the electronic health record database were available for a 10-year period from June 29, 2005 to July 22, 2015. A simple band-pass filter was applied to remove artifact in the physiologic time-series data for heart rate and blood pressure, with heart rate values 40 or above 250, mean or diastolic blood pressures below 20 or above 200, and systolic blood pressures below 30 or above 200 all excluded. For each anesthetic, the centiles of physiological variables (BP, HR) were calculated. Results: Data were available for 54 896 anesthetics in children 6 years and younger. There were 898 anesthesia reports available that included blood pressure measures immediately before induction. A larger number of anesthesia records (n = 30 008) were available for intraoperative blood pressure recording. The BP decrease after anesthesia induction was most pronounced in infants 0–10 weeks of age where there was a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) decrease of 16.6–34.5% (mean 28.6%). Systolic blood pressure decreased by 16.3–32.6% (mean 25.5%). Values above a systolic blood pressure of 60 mm Hg were only noted in half the neonates during anesthesia. Heart rates, both before and after anesthesia induction, were similar. Conclusion: Heart rate while under anesthesia appears a poor indicator for blood pressure changes. Recorded blood pressures in this current study, measured immediately before induction, were consistent with those in the literature.

Methods: We conducted a content analysis of popular newspaper articles for reporting about the causes, management, and depictions of gout. The Factiva database was used to identify articles from the 21 highest circulation newspapers in the UK and US from August 2010 to August 2015. Articles with a primary focus on gout were analyzed (n = 114). Results: Overindulgence of certain foods and beverages was most commonly reported as the cause of gout (72 of 114 articles). The range of dietary advice for gout management was extensive, with advice to decrease intake of 44 different food and beverage items and increase intake of 17 different food and beverage items. Strong advice was given for 23 of 40 dietary strategies (58%), 13 of 29 antiinflammatory strategies (45%), and 4 of 42 urate-lowering therapy strategies (10%) (P < 0.0001). Serum urate monitoring or treatment targets were rarely reported. Social embarrassment due to gout was reported in 27 of 114 articles (23.7%). Jokes or humorous references to gout were reported in 30 of 114 articles (26.3%), often highlighting causal beliefs related to lifestyle and drinking alcohol. Conclusion: Popular newspaper articles depict gout as a self-inflicted condition that is socially embarrassing and the focus of humor. Dietary solutions are overemphasized compared to effective urate-lowering strategies. Initiatives that challenge popular perceptions of gout may play an important role in changing public understanding about the disease, ultimately increasing the uptake of effective urate-lowering therapy and reducing reliance on unproven strategies. ? 2016, American College of Rheumatology",,allopurinol; colchicine; urate; antigout agent; Article; beverage; content analysis; controlled study; drinking behavior; food intake; genetic variability; gout; human; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; medical literature; perception; publication; qualitative research; United Kingdom; United States; adverse effects; consumer health information; diet; female; gout; lifestyle; male; procedures; psychology; publication; Alcohol Drinking; Consumer Health Information; Diet; Female; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Life Style; Male; Newspapers as Topic; United Kingdom; United States,2-s2.0-84990866207

Here, we comprehensively analyzed the maternal characteristics, health behaviors before and during pregnancy, as well as pregnancy and birth outcomes, across three different pregnancy planning status in 861 women participating in an ongoing Asian mother-offspring cohort study. At 26–28?weeks’ gestation, the women’s intention and enthusiasm toward their pregnancy were used to classify their pregnancy into planned or unplanned, and unplanned pregnancy was further subdivided into mistimed or unintended. Data on maternal characteristics, health behaviors, and pregnancy outcomes up to that stage were recorded. After delivery, birth outcomes of the offspring were recorded. Linear and logistic regression analyses were performed. Overall, 56?% had a planned pregnancy, 39?% mistimed, and 5?% unintended. Compared to women who planned their pregnancy, women with mistimed pregnancy had higher body mass index and were more likely to have cigarette smoke exposure and less likely to have folic acid supplementation. At 26–28?weeks’ gestation, unintended pregnancy was associated with increased anxiety. Neonates of mistimed pregnancy had shorter birth length compared to those of planned pregnancy, even after adjustment for maternal baseline demographics. These findings suggest that mothers who did not plan their pregnancy had less desirable characteristics or health behaviors before and during pregnancy and poorer pregnancy and birth outcomes. Shorter birth length in mistimed pregnancy may be attributed to maternal behaviors before or in the early stages of pregnancy, therefore highlighting the importance of preconception health promotion and screening for women of child-bearing age. ? 2016, Society for Prevention Research.",Family planning; Maternal health behavior; Neonatal outcome; Pregnancy,adult; cohort analysis; family size; female; gestational age; health behavior; human; male; maternal behavior; outcome assessment; pregnancy; prenatal care; procedures; Singapore; Adult; Cohort Studies; Family Characteristics; Female; Gestational Age; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Maternal Behavior; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Singapore,2-s2.0-84984821842

However, the relationship between abnormally elevated serum eNAMPT and type 2 diabetes pathophysiology is unclear. eNAMPT circulates in functionally and structurally distinct monomeric and dimeric forms. Dimeric eNAMPT promotes NAD biosynthesis. The role of eNAMPT-monomer is unclear but it may have NAD-independent proinflammatory effects. However, studies of eNAMPT in type 2 diabetes have not distinguished between monomeric and dimeric forms. Since type 2 diabetes is characterised by chronic inflammation, we hypothesised a selective NAD-independent role for eNAMPT-monomer in type 2 diabetes. Methods: Two mouse models were used to examine the role of eNAMPT-monomer in type 2 diabetes; (1) a mouse model of diabetes fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 10?weeks received i.p. injections with an anti-monomeric-eNAMPT antibody; and (2) lean non-diabetic mice received i.p. injections with recombinant monomeric eNAMPT daily for 14?days. Results: Serum monomeric eNAMPT levels were elevated in HFD-fed mouse models of diabetes, whilst eNAMPT-dimer levels were unchanged. eNAMPT-monomer neutralisation in HFD-fed mice resulted in lower blood glucose levels, amelioration of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and whole-body insulin resistance, improved pancreatic islet function, and reduced inflammation. These effects were maintained for at least 3?weeks post-treatment. eNAMPT-monomer administration induced a diabetic phenotype in mice, characterised by elevated blood glucose, IGT, impaired pancreatic insulin secretion and the presence of systemic and tissue inflammation, without changes in NAD levels. Conclusions/interpretation: We demonstrate that elevation of monomeric-eNAMPT plays an important role in the pathogenesis of diet-induced diabetes via proinflammatory mechanisms. These data provide proof-of-concept evidence that the eNAMPT-monomer represents a potential therapeutic target for type 2 diabetes. ? 2016, The Author(s).",Beta cell; eNAMPT; Extracellular nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; Inflammation; Islet; Type 2 diabetes,"CD11b antigen; glucose; insulin; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; liver protein; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monomer; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; antibody; insulin; nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody specificity; apoptosis; Article; body weight; chronic inflammation; controlled study; cytokine production; disease severity; enzyme activation; experimental diabetes mellitus; fat content; gene expression; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid liver level; male; mouse; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet cell function; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; priority journal; triacylglycerol blood level; white adipocyte; adverse effects; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; blood; C57BL mouse; cell line; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug effects; genetics; in vitro study; lipid diet; lipid metabolism; liver; metabolism; pancreas islet; physiology; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Animals; Antibodies; Cell Line; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diet, High-Fat; In Vitro Techniques; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Islets of Langerhans; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nicotinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",2-s2.0-84982296480

Methods: Patients at least 2?years from sleeve gastrectomy, who had experienced weight regain, were invited to participate in a focus group discussion. Participants were asked to complete a demographic survey and discussions were audio-recorded. Transcripts underwent content analysis using an inductive approach. Results: Thirty-eight participants participated in one of seven focus group discussions. The majority of participants were female, European and satisfied with the surgery and follow-up care. Participants described positive and negative aspects of the surgery, their follow-up care and causes of weight regain. Important emergent themes included the desire for more support, that is delivered within the overarching principles of providing individualised, specialised care by providers that maintain good rapport and assist in maintaining motivation. Furthermore, this follow-up support may be delivered in non-traditional ways rather than conventional face-to-face consultations.

The study aim was to determine if this same pattern in ethnic variation occurred in more recent NHANES surveys. Cross-sectional data came from the NHANES carried out from 1988 to 1994 (NHANES III) and from 2001 to 2006 (NHANES 01-06). The analysis included 11,331 people (5641 non-Hispanic white, 2714 non-Hispanic black and 2976 Mexican American) without known diabetes mellitus, fasting for ?8 h and aged ?20 years, with available measurements of 25(OH)D, fasting glucose, fasting insulin and body mass index (BMI). Adjusting for age, gender, BMI, leisure time physical activity and season, higher levels of 25(OH)D were associated with decreased fasting glucose, decreased fasting insulin, and decreased diabetes risk in both non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans for both surveys and when combined. When combining NHANES III and NHANES 01-06 the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for having diabetes was 0.28 (0.19, 0.41) in the highest 25(OH)D quartile compared to the lowest quartile in non-Hispanic whites, and 0.13 (0.06, 0.28) in Mexican Americans (both p < 0.0001); but 1.54 (0.62, 3.82) in non-Hispanic blacks, among whom 25(OH)D was not associated with fasting glucose, fasting insulin, or diabetes risk (p > 0.05). There was a significant interaction between non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans combined, compared with non-Hispanic blacks, when 25(OH)D was regressed against fasting glucose (p = 0.016) but not against fasting insulin (p > 0.05). The major finding in both NHANES surveys of consistent inverse associations between serum 25(OH)D concentrations and diabetes risk in non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, but not in non-Hispanic blacks, suggests this finding is unlikely due to chance. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd",25-Hydroxyvitamin D; Diabetes mellitus; Glucose; Insulin; Population survey; Vitamin D,25 hydroxyvitamin D; glucose; insulin; glucose blood level; insulin; vitamin D; adult; Black person; body mass; Caucasian; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; diet restriction; ethnic difference; female; health survey; high risk population; human; leisure; major clinical study; male; Mexican American; middle aged; National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey; nutritional assessment; physical activity; population research; Review; risk reduction; season; vitamin blood level; young adult; African American; aged; analysis; blood; diabetes mellitus; ethnology; glucose blood level; nutrition; odds ratio; risk factor; United States; Adult; African Americans; African Continental Ancestry Group; Aged; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Insulin; Male; Mexican Americans; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Odds Ratio; Risk Factors; United States; Vitamin D; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84950134713

Existing evidence-based treatments for children include patching the nonamblyopic eye to encourage use of the amblyopic eye. Currently there are no widely accepted treatments available for adults with amblyopia. The aim of this trial is to assess the efficacy of a new binocular, videogame-based treatment for amblyopia in older children and adults. We hypothesise that binocular treatment will significantly improve amblyopic eye visual acuity relative to placebo treatment. Methods/design: The BRAVO study is a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre trial to assess the effectiveness of a novel videogame-based binocular treatment for amblyopia. One hundred and eight participants aged 7 years or older with anisometropic and/or strabismic amblyopia (defined as ?0.2 LogMAR interocular visual acuity difference, ?0.3 LogMAR amblyopic eye visual acuity and no ocular disease) will be recruited via ophthalmologists, optometrists, clinical record searches and public advertisements at five sites in New Zealand, Canada, Hong Kong and Australia. Eligible participants will be randomised by computer in a 1:1 ratio, with stratification by age group: 7-12, 13-17 and 18 years and older. Participants will be randomised to receive 6 weeks of active or placebo home-based binocular treatment. Treatment will be in the form of a modified interactive falling-blocks game, implemented on a 5th generation iPod touch device viewed through red/green anaglyphic glasses. Participants and those assessing outcomes will be blinded to group assignment. The primary outcome is the change in best-corrected distance visual acuity in the amblyopic eye from baseline to 6 weeks post randomisation. Secondary outcomes include distance and near visual acuity, stereopsis, interocular suppression, angle of strabismus (where applicable) measured at baseline, 3, 6, 12 and 24 weeks post randomisation. Treatment compliance and acceptability will also be assessed along with quality of life for adult participants. Discussion: The BRAVO study is the first randomised controlled trial of a home-based videogame treatment for older children and adults with amblyopia. The results will indicate whether a binocular approach to amblyopia treatment conducted at home is effective for patients aged 7 years or older.

These AGEs typically occur at lysine and arginine residues of long-lived proteins, such as collagen, and can modify the structure and function of the native protein. AGEs accumulate during the normal aging process, and AGE formation is dramatically accelerated with diabetes. AGEs have also been implicated in a wide range of debilitating conditions including cardiovascular, renal failure, and neurodegenerative diseases. Thus, there is an ongoing interest in studying the role of AGEs in different aspects of these disorders. Typically, glycated proteins are prepared using nonspecific in vitro incubation techniques. However, this method results in a complex mixture of products which is then employed without further purification. In order to determine the effect of individual AGEs in a peptide sequence, in this Account, we highlight our synthetic methods for site-specifically introducing five frequently occurring AGEs, namely, N?-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML), N?-(carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL), pyrraline, glyoxal-lysine dimer (GOLD), and methylglyoxal-lysine dimer (MOLD) into collagen peptides. Both a collagen model peptide (CMP) and the telopeptide region of human type I α1 collagen (CTP) were chosen due to being prone to glycation and cross-linking in vivo. For the preparation of the AGE-modified collagen peptides, we investigated both the initial preparation of AGE building blocks in solution followed by incorporation into Fmoc-SPPS, as well as an on-resin method whereby AGEs were selectively introduced by modification of the side-chain of an unprotected resin-bound lysine. Both of our synthetic methods enabled the site-specifically modified AGE-containing collagen peptides to be obtained in high purity and yield. In addition, the on-resin method had the added advantage of requiring fewer synthetic steps. We then evaluated the impact of the specific AGEs on the properties of the native protein and found that the AGE modifications protected against proteolytic digestion, enhanced copper binding at physiological pH, and, for the cross-linking AGEs, disrupted the triple helical structure of CMPs. Overall these synthetic methods offered a new strategy for preparing peptides site-specifically modified by AGEs, which can be applied to other peptidic systems, thereby enabling further insights into the biochemical consequences of AGEs. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"advanced glycation end product; peptide; chemical structure; chemistry; glycosylation; synthesis; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Glycosylation; Molecular Structure; Peptides",2-s2.0-84991764297

Methods: A systematic review of the application of such theoretical frameworks within the field of obesity prevention policy was conducted. A meta-synthesis was also undertaken to identify the key influences on policy decision-making. Results: The review identified 17 studies of obesity prevention policy underpinned by political science theories. The majority of included studies were conducted in the United States (US), with significant heterogeneity in terms of policy level (e.g., national, state) studied, areas of focus, and methodologies used. Many of the included studies were methodologically limited, in regard to rigour and trustworthiness. Prominent themes identified included the role of groups and networks, political institutions, and political system characteristics, issue framing, the use of evidence, personal values and beliefs, prevailing political ideology, and timing. Conclusions: The limited application of political science theories indicates a need for future theoretically based research into the complexity of policy-making and multiple influences on obesity prevention policy processes. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Food; Nutrition; Obesity prevention; Policy; Policy process,health care policy; human; management; meta analysis; obesity; politics; United States; Health Policy; Humans; Obesity; Policy Making; Politics; United States,2-s2.0-84992084030

However, contemporary data are lacking regarding circulating group A Streptococcal (GAS) strains in NZ. Such information is important in guiding vaccine development. Methods: GAS isolates from April to June 2015 were recovered from skin and pharyngeal samples from children living in areas of high social deprivation in Auckland, NZ, a significant proportion of which are Maori or Pacific. These children are among the highest risk group for developing ARF. Isolates were compared to concurrently collected pharyngeal isolates from Dunedin, NZ, where both the proportion of Maori and Pacific children and risk of developing ARF is low. Emm typing, emm cluster typing and theoretical coverage of the 30-valent vaccine candidate were undertaken as previously described. Results: A high diversity of emm types and a high proportion of emm-pattern D and cluster D4 isolates were detected amongst both skin and pharyngeal isolates in children at high risk of ARF. Pharyngeal isolates from children at low risk of ARF within the same country were significantly less diverse, less likely to be emm pattern D, and more likely to be theoretically covered by the 30-valent M protein vaccine. Conclusions: The high proportion of emm pattern D GAS strains amongst skin and pharyngeal isolates from children at high risk of ARF raises further questions about the role of skin infection in ARF pathogenesis. Emm types and emm clusters differed considerably between ARF endemic and non-endemic settings, even within the same country. This difference should be taken into account for vaccine development. ? 2016 The Author(s).",,"bacterial vaccine; M protein; M protein vaccine; unclassified drug; bacterial antigen; carrier protein; outer membrane protein; streptococcal M protein; Streptococcus vaccine; adolescent; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; bacterium detection; bacterium isolate; child; controlled study; drug research; emm gene; female; gene cluster; genetic variability; high risk population; human; low risk population; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); molecular epidemiology; New Zealand; nonhuman; Pacific Islander; pathogenesis; pharyngitis; poverty; protein analysis; rheumatic fever; skin infection; Streptococcus group A; Streptococcus pyogenes; comparative study; immunology; microbiology; pharyngitis; Skin Diseases, Infectious; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Carrier Proteins; Child; Female; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Pharyngitis; Skin Diseases, Infectious; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcal Vaccines; Streptococcus pyogenes",2-s2.0-84991215019

The study also examined whether discrepancy in patient and caregiver perceptions at diagnosis predicted patient health-related quality of life (HRQL) at six months. Design: Forty-two patient–caregiver dyads completed the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief IPQ) at diagnosis and again six months later. Patients also completed a HRQL questionnaire at both time points. Analyses were performed using the Actor–Partner Interdependence Model. Main Outcome Measure: Total patient HRQL assessed by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT-H&N). Results: Perceptions of emotional impact and illness concern reduced over time in patients and caregivers. Perceptions of treatment control and identity increased in caregivers only. After controlling for the effects of baseline HRQL, and the individual contribution of patient and caregiver illness perceptions, greater discrepancy in perceptions of timeline, personal control, and illness identity among dyads at diagnosis predicted lower patient HRQL at six-month follow-up. Conclusion: Patients’ and their caregivers’ perceptions of HNC are dynamic over time.

OBJECTIVE To compare overall survival (OS) and functional outcomes among patients with T3 glottic SCC receiving nonsurgical and surgical management. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This secondary analysis used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registry and Medicare databases. All patients with T3 glottic SCC who received a diagnosis from January 1, 1992, to December 31, 2010, were included. Data were analyzed from April 2014 to August 2015. INTERVENTIONS Surgery with or without adjuvant radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Five-year OS and functional outcomes. RESULTS Among the 487 patients identified with T3 glottic SCC (418 men [85.8%]; 69 women [14.2%]; median age, 74.3 [interquartile range, 70.4-80.6] years), the 5-year OS for nonsurgical management, surgery alone, and surgery plus adjuvant treatment were 36% (95%CI, 30%-42%), 41%(95%CI, 30%-53%), and 41%(95%CI, 32%-51%), respectively. Multivariable analyses revealed an adjusted hazard ratio for OS of 0.68 (95%CI, 0.49-0.94) for patients receiving surgery alone vs nonsurgical management and 0.75 (95%CI, 0.57-0.98) for patients receiving surgery plus adjuvant treatment vs nonsurgical management. Gastrostomy tube dependence was highest in patients receiving surgery plus adjuvant treatment (30 of 98 patients [30.6%]). Tracheostomy dependence was highest in patients receiving chemoradiotherapy (34 of 92 patients [37.0%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Overall survival showed a statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvement in patients with T3 glottic SCC who underwent surgery compared with a nonsurgical treatment.

To facilitate further development of QQ as antimycobacterial drugs, we investigated the molecular mechanism and target of QQ in mycobacteria. Methods: Cell viability of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu?rin was determined in the presence of QQ8c, a representative QQ compound, and isoniazid, a frontline antitubercular drug. The effect of QQ8c on mycobacterial energetics was studied using inverted membrane vesicles. NADH oxidation and formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were measured in the presence and absence of KCN. Generation of ROS was measured via oxygen consumption in an oxygen electrode. The effects of QQ8c were compared with the antimycobacterial drug clofazimine in side-by-side experiments. Results: QQ8c challenge resulted in complete sterilization of cultures with no refractory resistant population observed. QQ8c stimulated NADH oxidation by type II NADH dehydrogenase (NDH-2) and oxygen consumption in inverted membrane vesicles. Large quantities of ROS were produced in the presence of QQ8. Even when oxygen consumption was blocked with KCN, activation of NDH-2 by QQ8c occurred suggesting QQ8c was redox cycling. Conclusions: QQ8c targets NDH-2 of the mycobacterial respiratory chain leading to activation of NADH oxidation and generating bactericidal levels of ROS in a manner similar to, but more effectively than, the antimycobacterial drug clofazimine. Our results validate respiratory-generated ROS as an avenue for antimycobacterial drug development. ? The Author 2016.

However, the extent to which their effects might vary in different participants and settings is uncertain. We aim to conduct a systematic review and individual participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of randomised clinical trials examining text message interventions aimed to prevent cardiovascular diseases (CVD) through modification of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs). Methods and analysis Systematic review and IPD meta-analysis will be conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic review and Meta-Analysis of IPD (PRISMA-IPD) guidelines. Electronic database of published studies (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Cochrane Library) and international trial registries will be searched to identify relevant randomised clinical trials. Authors of studies meeting the inclusion criteria will be invited to join the IPD meta-analysis group and contribute study data to the common database. The primary outcome will be the difference between intervention and control groups in blood pressure at 6-month follow-up. Key secondary outcomes include effects on lipid parameters, body mass index, smoking levels and self-reported quality of life. If sufficient data is available, we will also analyse blood pressure and other secondary outcomes at 12 months. IPD meta-analysis will be performed using a one-step approach and modelling data simultaneously while accounting for the clustering of the participants within studies. This study will use the existing data to assess the effectiveness of text message-based interventions on CVRFs, the consistency of any effects by participant subgroups and across different healthcare settings. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was obtained for the individual studies by the trial investigators from relevant local ethics committees. This study will include anonymised data for secondary analysis and investigators will be asked to check that this is consistent with their existing approvals. Results will be disseminated via scientific forums including peer-reviewed publications and presentations at international conferences. ?

Current antibiotic therapy is guided by swab culture results. In the absence of detailed molecular microbiology studies of CSOM patients, our current understanding of the microbiota of CSOM (and indeed of the healthy ear) remains incomplete. In this prospective study, 24 patients with CSOM were recruited, along with 22 healthy controls. Culture-based techniques and 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing were used to profile the bacterial community for each patient. Comparisons between patients with and without cholesteatoma in the middle ear and mastoid cavity were also made. A major finding was that the middle ear of many healthy controls was not sterile, which is contradictory to the results of previous studies. However, sequencing data showed that Staphylococcus aureus, along with a range of other Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, were present in all subgroups of CSOM and healthy controls. Large interpatient variability in the microbiota was observed within each subgroup of CSOM and controls, and there was no bacterial community ""signature"" which was characteristic of either health or disease. Comparisons of the culture results with the molecular data show that culture-based techniques underestimate the diversity of bacteria found within the ear. This study reports the first detailed examination of bacterial profiles of the ear in healthy controls and patients with CSOM. Copyright ? 2016, American Society for Microbiology.

To obtain reliable insights, the need for bacterial DNA of high quality and integrity following appropriate faecal sample collection and preservation steps is paramount. In a study of dietary mineral balance in the context of type 2 diabetes (T2D), faecal samples were collected from healthy and T2D individuals throughout a 13-day residential trial. These samples were freeze-dried, then stored mostly at -20°C from the trial date in 2000/2001 until the current research in 2014. Given the relative antiquity of these samples (?14 years), we sought to evaluate DNA quality and comparability to freshly collected human faecal samples. Following the extraction of bacterial DNA, gel electrophoresis indicated that our DNA extracts were more sheared than extracts made from freshly collected faecal samples, but still of sufficiently high molecular weight to support amplicon-based studies. Likewise, spectrophotometric assessment of extracts revealed that they were of high quality and quantity. A subset of bacterial 16S rRNA gene amplicons were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq and compared against publicly available sequence data representing a similar cohort analysed by the American Gut Project (AGP). Notably, our bacterial community profiles were highly consistent with those from the AGP data. Our results suggest that when faecal specimens are stored appropriately, the microbial profiles are preserved and robust to extended storage periods. ? 2016 Kia et al.

This study aimed to identify biomarkers predicting prognosis and/or response to sorafenib, with or without erlotinib, in hepatocellular carcinoma patients from the phase III SEARCH trial. Experimental Design: A total of 720 patients were randomized to receive oral sorafenib 400 mg twice daily plus erlotinib 150 mg once daily or placebo. Fifteen growth factors relevant to the treatment regimen and/or to hepatocellular carcinoma were measured in baseline plasma samples. Results: Baseline plasma biomarkers were measured in 494 (69%) patients (sorafenib plus erlotinib, n = 243; sorafenib plus placebo, n = 251). Treatment arm-independent analyses showed that elevated hepatocyte growth factor [HGF; HR, 1.687 (high vs. low expression); endpoint multiplicity adjusted (e-adj) P = 0.0001] and elevated plasma VEGFA (HR, 1.386; e-adj P = 0.0377) were significantly associated with poor overall survival (OS) in multivariate analyses, and low plasma KIT [HR, 0.75 (high vs. low); P = 0.0233; e-adj P = 0.2793] tended to correlate with poorer OS. High plasma VEGFC independently correlated with longer TTP (HR, 0.633; e-adj P = 0.0010) and trended toward associating with improved disease control rate (univariate: OR, 2.047; P = 0.030; e-adj P = 0.420). In 67% of evaluable patients (339/494), a multimarker signature of HGF, VEGFA, KIT, EPGN, and VEGFC correlated with improved median OS in multivariate analysis (HR, 0.150; P < 0.00001). No biomarker predicted efficacy from erlotinib. Conclusions: Baseline plasma HGF, VEGFA, KIT, and VEGFC correlated with clinical outcomes in hepatocellular carcinoma patients treated with sorafenib with or without erlotinib. These biomarkers plus EPGN constituted a multimarker signature for improved OS.

To facilitate research on SSC implementation, a valid and reliable instrument is needed for measuring OR team behaviours during its administration. We developed a behaviourally anchored rating scale (BARS) for this purpose. Methods We used a modified Delphi process, involving 16 subject matter experts, to compile a BARS with behavioural domains applicable to all three phases of the SSC. We evaluated the instrument in 80 adult OR cases and 30 simulated cases using two medical student raters and seven expert raters, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to assess inter-rater reliability. Internal consistency and instrument discrimination were explored. Sample size estimates for potential study designs using the instrument were calculated. Results The Delphi process resulted in a BARS instrument (the WHOBARS) with five behavioural domains. Intraclass correlation coefficients calculated from the OR cases exceeded 0.80 for 80% of the instrument's domains across the SSC phases. The WHOBARS showed high internal consistency across the three phases of the SSC and ability to discriminate among surgical cases in both clinical and simulated settings. Fewer than 20 cases per group would be required to show a difference of 1 point between groups in studies of the SSC, where α=0.05 and β=0.8. Conclusion We have developed a generic instrument for comprehensively rating the administration of the SSC and informing initiatives to realise its full potential. We have provided data supporting its capacity for discrimination, internal consistency and inter-rater reliability. Further psychometric evaluation is warranted. ? 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",Checklists; Communication; Patient safety; Surgery; Teamwork,adult; Article; behavior assessment; behaviourally anchored rating scale; checklist; correlation analysis; Delphi study; evaluation study; human; internal consistency; interrater reliability; medical student; operating room; patient safety; rating scale; sample size; scoring system; surgical equipment; surgical safety checklist; teamwork; world health organization; checklist; interpersonal communication; organization and management; patient care; questionnaire; reproducibility; standards; world health organization; Checklist; Communication; Humans; Operating Rooms; Patient Care Team; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; World Health Organization,2-s2.0-84990232953

In many conditions, CPET outperforms the traditional variables in predicting mortality. Aim: In patients with cirrhosis listed for liver transplantation, our primary aim was to determine the prognostic value of CPET for pre-and post-transplant mortality and, in particular, whether CPET remained predictive after adjustment for liver disease severity. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted in databases Medline, Scopus, Embase and PubMed. Where possible, data were pooled for meta-analyses using a DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Results: A total of seven studies were retrieved, including 1107 patients with a mean MELD of 14.2 (standard deviation 1.6) and peak baseline VO2 of 17.4 mL/kg/min. In all of the studies in which multivariable analysis was performed, CPET variables were independent predictors of pre-transplant mortality (three studies) and post-transplant mortality (four studies). In the three studies where we could aggregate post-transplant mortality data, post-transplant mortality was predicted by AT with a mean difference of 2.0 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.42–3.59; Z = 2.48, P = 0.01) between survivors and nonsurvivors. The peak VO2 was not significant (0.77 95% CI: ?1.36 to 2.90; Z = 0.71, P = 0.48). Conclusions: Patient's listed for liver transplant have significant functional limitations, with a weighted mean VO2 below the threshold level required for independent living. Although heterogeneity in study designs with respect to timing, CPET variables, and cut-off values precluded the determination of CPET mortality thresholds, the studies support CPET as an objective and independent predictor of pre- and post-transplant mortality. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,anaerobic threshold; cardiopulmonary exercise test; human; length of stay; liver transplantation; Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score; mortality; outcome assessment; oxygen consumption; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; prognosis; Review; sensitivity and specificity; survival; systematic review,2-s2.0-84987776574

Pain, undesirable inflammation and infection are common complications experienced by patients following surgery. Opioids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), local anaesthetics (LAs) and antibiotics are the commonly administered drugs peri-operatively to manage these complications. Post-operative pharmacotherapy is typically achieved using immediate-release dosage forms of drugs, which lead to issues around fluctuating plasma concentrations, systemic adverse effects and poor patient adherence. Controlled release (CR) systems for certain medicines including opioids, NSAIDs and antibiotics have demonstrably enhanced treatment efficacy in the post-surgical setting. However, challenges remain to ensure patient safety while achieving individual therapeutic needs. Newer CR systems in the research and development pipeline have a high level of control over medicine release, which can be initiated, tuned or stopped on-demand. Future systems will self-regulate drug release in response to biological markers providing precise individualized therapy. In this review, we cover currently adopted CR systems in post-operative pharmacotherapy, including drug eluting medical devices, and highlight a series of examples of novel CR technologies that have the potential for translation into post-surgical settings to improve medication efficacy and enhance post-surgical recovery. ? 2016, Controlled Release Society.",Controlled release systems; Pharmacotherapy; Post-operative management; Surgery; Surgical recovery,"antibiotic agent; antibiotic bone cement; local anesthetic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; antiinfective agent; narcotic analgesic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; biodegradable implant; bone cement device; catheter infection; central venous catheter; controlled drug release; drug delivery system; drug dose; drug efficacy; human; levonorgestrel releasing intrauterine system; medical device complication; medication compliance; nonhuman; orthopedic implant; patient safety; perioperative period; polyglactin suture; postoperative care; postoperative infection; postoperative inflammation; postoperative pain; priority journal; prosthesis infection; prosthesis loosening; Review; surgical mesh; surgical patient; wound dressing; delayed release formulation; drug delivery system; postoperative complication; procedures; therapeutic use; Analgesics, Opioid; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Postoperative Complications",2-s2.0-84983670715

Here, we expand on these studies and investigate the effects of load carriage on joint reaction forces (JRFs) and the resulting spatiotemporal stress/strain distributions in the tibia. Using full-body motion and ground reaction forces from a female subject, we computed joint and muscle forces during walking for four load carriage conditions. We applied these forces as physiological loading conditions in a finite-element (FE) analysis to compute strain and stress. We derived material properties from computed tomography (CT) images of a sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched subject using a mesh morphing and mapping algorithm, and used them within the FE model. Compared to walking with no load, the knee JRFs were the most sensitive to load carriage, increasing by as much as 26.2% when carrying a 30% of body weight (BW) load (ankle: 16.4% and hip: 19.0%). Moreover, our model revealed disproportionate increases in internal JRFs with increases in load carriage, suggesting a coordinated adjustment in the musculature functions in the lower extremity. FE results reflected the complex effects of spatially varying material properties distribution and muscular engagement on tibial biomechanics during walking. We observed high stresses on the anterior crest and the medial surface of the tibia at pushoff, whereas high cumulative stress during one walking cycle was more prominent in the medioposterior aspect of the tibia. Our findings reinforce the need to include: (1) physiologically accurate loading conditions when modeling healthy subjects undergoing short-Term exercise training and (2) the duration of stress exposure when evaluating stress-fracture injury risk. As a fundamental step toward understanding the instantaneous effect of external loading, our study presents a means to assess the relationship between load carriage and bone biomechanics. ?

Changes in sensory quality, such as color and rheology, during 4?weeks storage at 4?°C were also investigated. The temperature of DAP rose to 70?°C in 37 and 122?s at 11 and 4.4?W/g?MW, respectively. It was observed that over 80% PPO could be inactivated in 80?s at 11.0?W/g. During storage, the residual PPO activity of untreated samples continuously increased to 250% whereas for MW treated samples the residual PPO activity remained constant at around 20%; however, no PME activity was detected. At the end of storage, for samples treated at 11?W/g for 80?s total phenolic content increased by 29.41% and negligible losses in chlorophyll a and b content occurred whereas for control samples the decrease in chlorophyll a and b was 38.2% and 37.1%, respectively. Although not significant (p?&gt;?0.05), the a* value of MW treated samples increased whereas the L* value decreased. MW treatment did not alter the pseudoplastic flow behavior and particle size distribution of DAP, while the apparent viscosity was slightly higher than that of untreated DAP at lower shear rates (1–10?s??1). Industrial relevance The defatted avocado puree (DAP) can be used in cosmetics industry as an ingredient and can also be used in human consumption as it helps to reduce body weight and total hepatic fat. However, due to polyphenol oxidase (PPO) present in DAP, browning can take place and therefore PPO must be inactivated. We have found that microwave treatment could considerably lower the activity of PPO and aids in preserving the sensory and nutritional quality during storage at 4?°C. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Avocado; Microwave treatment; Nutrition; Polyphenoloxidase; Sensory; Storage,Chlorophyll; Energy storage; Fruits; Microwave heating; Microwaves; Nutrition; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Sensory aids; Shear flow; Avocado; Enzyme inactivation; Microwave treatment; Nutritional qualities; Pectin methylesterase; Polyphenol oxidase; Sensory; Total phenolic content; Food storage,2-s2.0-84981340609

However, there is also evidence of lipid dyshomeostasis-mediated AD pathology. Given the structural diversity of lipids, mass spectrometry is a useful tool for studying lipid changes in AD. Although there have been a few studies investigating lipid changes in the human hippocampus in particular, there are few reports on how lipids change in each hippocampal subfield (e.g., Cornu Ammonis [CA] 1–4, dentate gyrus [DG] etc.). Since each subfield has its own function, we postulated that there could be lipid changes that are unique to each. Methods: We used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry to investigate specific lipid changes in each subfield in AD. Data from the hippocampus region of six age- and gender-matched normal and AD pairs were analyzed with SCiLS lab 2015b software (SCiLS GmbH, Germany; RRID:SCR_014426), using an analysis workflow developed in-house. Hematoxylin, eosin, and luxol fast blue staining were used to precisely delineate each anatomical hippocampal subfield. Putative lipid identities, which were consistent with published data, were assigned using MS/MS. Results: Both positively and negatively charged lipid ion species were abundantly detected in normal and AD tissue. While the distribution pattern of lipids did not change in AD, the abundance of some lipids changed, consistent with trends that have been previously reported. However, our results indicated that the majority of these lipid changes specifically occur in the CA1 region. Additionally, there were many lipid changes that were specific to the DG. Conclusions: Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-imaging mass spectrometry and our analysis workflow provide a novel method to investigate specific lipid changes in hippocampal subfields. Future work will focus on elucidating the role that specific lipid differences in each subfield play in AD pathogenesis. ? 2016 The Authors.

Two emerging fields are computational analysis of cardiac remodelling (shape and motion changes due to disease) and computational analysis of physiology and mechanics to estimate biophysical properties from non-invasive imaging. Many large cohort studies now underway around the world have been specifically designed based on non-invasive imaging technologies in order to gain new information about the development of heart disease from asymptomatic to clinical manifestations. These give an unprecedented breadth to the quantification of population variation and disease development. Also, for the individual patient, it is now possible to determine biophysical properties of myocardial tissue in health and disease by interpreting detailed imaging data using computational modelling. For these population and patient-specific computational modelling methods to develop further, we need open benchmarks for algorithm comparison and validation, open sharing of data and algorithms, and demonstration of clinical efficacy in patient management and care. The combination of population and patient-specific modelling will give new insights into the mechanisms of cardiac disease, in particular the development of heart failure, congenital heart disease, myocardial infarction, contractile dysfunction and diastolic dysfunction. ? 2016",Biomechanics; Cardiac atlases; Computational modelling,"Artificial intelligence; Biomechanics; Biophysics; Cardiology; Computation theory; Computational methods; Heart; Imaging techniques; Learning systems; Medical computing; Population statistics; Biophysical properties; Cardiac atlases; Clinical manifestation; Computational image analysis; Computational modelling; Congenital heart disease; Contractile dysfunction; Patient-specific modelling; Diseases; algorithm; biomechanics; cardiac imaging; clinical study; diagnostic imaging; Editorial; heart disease; heart function; human; image analysis; mathematical model; physiology; preclinical study; priority journal; quality control; validation process; benchmarking; biological model; heart; heart disease; pathology; reproducibility; standards; Algorithms; Benchmarking; Cardiac Imaging Techniques; Heart; Heart Diseases; Humans; Models, Cardiovascular; Reproducibility of Results",2-s2.0-84977480772

We attempted to determine whether outcomes differed between patients treated either with a beta-lactam or with a macrolide or lincosamide. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of published trials in which patients with cellulitis or erysipelas were randomised to treatment either with a beta-lactam or with a macrolide or lincosamide. We searched PUBMED, EMBASE, MEDLINE and SCOPUS (up to March 2014) using the terms: cellulitis/erysipelas, penicillin/beta-lactam, macrolide/lincosamide, random*/controlled*/trial* as keywords. We included randomised trials that compared monotherapy with a beta-lactam with monotherapy with a macrolide or lincosamide for cellulitis or erysipelas. Results: We identified 15 studies, 9 in patients with cellulitis or erysipelas and 6 in patients with various skin and soft tissue infections including cellulitis and erysipelas. The efficacy of treatment of cellulitis or erysipelas was similar with a beta-lactam [27/221 (12?%) not cured] and a macrolide or lincosamide [21/241 (9?%) not cured, RR 1.24, 95?% CI 0.72–2.41, p?=?0.44]. Treatment efficacy was also similar for skin or soft tissue infections including cellulitis and erysipelas (RR 1.28, 95?% CI 0.96–1.69, p?=?0.09).

The objective of this study was to investigate whether coping strategies at HNC diagnosis were related to outcomes of post-traumatic stress and health-related quality of life (HRQL) 6?months later. Sixty-five patients with HNC completed an assessment of coping, distress, and health-related quality of life at diagnosis and again 6?months later, and an assessment of post-traumatic stress at 6?months. Correlations and regression analyses were performed to examine relationships between coping and outcomes over time. Regression analyses showed that denial, behavioural disengagement and self-blame at diagnosis predicted post-traumatic stress symptoms. Self-blame at diagnosis also predicted poor HRQL.

However, a suite of process and outcome indicators is needed for RMNCH to monitor care and to ensure comparability between settings. Here we report on the assessment of current global indicators and the development of a suite of indicators for the WHO Essential Interventions for use at various levels of health care systems nationally and globally. Methods: Currently available indicators from both household and facility surveys were collated through publicly available global databases and respective survey instruments. We then developed a suite of potential indicators and associated data points for the 45 WHO Essential Interventions spanning preconception to newborn care. Four types of performance indicators were identified (where applicable): process (i.e. coverage) and outcome (i.e. impact) indicators for both screening and treatment/prevention. Indicators were evaluated by an international expert panel against the eRegistries indicator evaluation criteria and further refined based on feedback by the eRegistries technical team. Results: Of the 45 WHO Essential Interventions, only 16 were addressed in any of the household survey data available. A set of 216 potential indicators was developed. These indicators were generally evaluated favourably by the panel, but difficulties in data ascertainment, including for outcome measures of cause-specific morbidity and mortality, were frequently reported as barriers to the feasibility of indicators. Indicators were refined based on feedback, culminating in the final list of 193 total unique indicators: 93 for preconception and antenatal care; 53 for childbirth and postpartum care; and 47 for newborn and small and ill baby care. Conclusions: Large gaps exist in the availability of information currently collected to support the implementation of the WHO Essential Interventions. The development of this suite of indicators can be used to support the implementation of eRegistries and other data platforms, to ensure that data are utilised to support evidence-based practice, facilitate measurement and accountability, and improve maternal and child health outcomes. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Ehealth; Intervention coverage; Maternal health; Newborn health; Outcome indicators; Performance indicators; Perinatal health; Process indicators; Registries,"child; childbirth; clinical article; data base; evidence based practice center; feasibility study; female; health care system; household; human; infant; maternal welfare; morbidity; mortality; newborn; newborn care; prenatal care; prevention; puerperium; register; screening; telehealth; adult; birth; electronic health record; family planning; health care quality; infant care; maternal child health care; obstetric delivery; pregnancy; register; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; world health organization; young adult; Adult; Delivery, Obstetric; Electronic Health Records; Family Planning Services; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Care; Infant, Newborn; Maternal-Child Health Services; Outcome and Process Assessment (Health Care); Parturition; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Registries; World Health Organization; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84992073559

General practitioners and accident and emergency departments are often used unnecessarily for the treatment of minor ailments. Community pharmacy is often the first port of call for patients in the provision of advice on minor ailments, advising the patient on treatment or referring the patient to an appropriate health professional when necessary. The potential for community pharmacists to act as providers of triage services has started to be recognised, and community pharmacy triage services (CPTS) are emerging in a number of countries. This review aimed to explore whether key components of triage services can be identified in the literature surrounding community pharmacy, to explore the evidence for the feasibility of implementing CPTS and to evaluate the evidence for the appropriateness of such services. Methods: Systematic searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA) databases from 1980 to March 2016. Results: Key elements of community pharmacy triage were identified in 37 studies, which were included in the review. When a guideline or protocol was used, accuracy in identifying the presenting condition was high, with concordance rates ranging from 70 % to 97.6 % between the pharmacist and a medical expert. However, when guidelines and protocols were not used, often questioning was deemed insufficient. Where other health professionals had reviewed decisions made by pharmacists and their staff, e.g. around advice and referral, the decisions were considered to be appropriate in the majority of cases. Authors of the included studies provided recommendations for improving these services, including use of guidelines/protocols, education and staff training, documentation, improving communication between health professional groups and consideration of privacy and confidentiality. Conclusion: Whilst few studies had specifically trialled triage services, results from this review indicate that a CPTS is feasible and appropriate, and has the potential to reduce the burden on other healthcare services. Questions still remain on issues such as ensuring the consistency of the service, whether all pharmacies could provide this service and who will fund the service. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Advice; Community pharmacy services; Patient outcome assessment; Pharmacist; Primary health care; Referral; Triage,confidentiality; documentation; Embase; emergency health service; feasibility study; health practitioner; human; medical expert; Medline; outcome assessment; patient referral; pharmacist; practice guideline; primary health care; privacy; staff training; systematic review,2-s2.0-84990032688

This study assessed the extent and nature of nutrition and health claims on the front-of-pack of 'healthy' and 'less-healthy' packaged foods in New Zealand. Foods from eight categories, for which consumption may affect the risk of obesity and diet-related chronic diseases, were selected from the 2014 Nutritrack database. The internationally standardised International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-Communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) taxonomy was used to classify claims on packages. The Nutrient Profiling Scoring Criterion (NPSC) was used to classify products as 'healthy' or 'less healthy'. In total, 7526 products were included, with 47 % (n 3557) classified as 'healthy'. More than one-third of products displayed at least one nutrition claim and 15 % featured at least one health claim on the front-of-pack. Claims were found on one-third of 'less-healthy' products; 26 % of those products displayed nutrition claims and 7 % featured health claims. About 45 % of 'healthy' products displayed nutrition claims and 23 % featured health claims. Out of 7058 individual claims, the majority (69 %) were found on 'healthy' products. Cereals displayed the greatest proportion of nutrition and health claims (1503 claims on 564 products), of which one-third were displayed on 'less-healthy' cereals. Such claims could be misleading consumers' perceptions of nutritional quality of foods. It needs to be explored how current regulations on nutrition and health claims in New Zealand could be further strengthened (e.g. using the NPSC for nutrition claims, including general health claims as per the INFORMAS taxonomy) to ensure consumers are protected and not misled. ?

In addition, existent literature rarely takes into consideration racial discrimination experienced by the partner. Methods: We analysed data from the Growing Up in New Zealand study to examine the burden of lifetime and past year experiences of racial discrimination on prenatal and postnatal mental health among M?ori, Pacific, and Asian women in New Zealand (NZ), and to study the individual and joint contribution of mother's and partner's experiences of lifetime and past year racial discrimination to women's prenatal and postnatal mental health. Results: Our findings show strong associations between lifetime and past year experiences of ethnically-motivated interpersonal attacks and unfair treatment on mother's mental health. M?ori, Pacific, and Asian women who had experienced unfair treatment by a health professional in their lifetime were 66 % more likely to suffer from postnatal depression, compared to women who did not report these experiences. We found a cumulative effect of lifetime experiences of ethnically-motivated personal attacks on poor maternal mental health if both the mother and the partner had experienced a racist attack. Conclusions: Experiences of racial discrimination have severe direct consequences for the mother's mental health. Given the importance of mother's mental health for the basic human needs of a healthy child, racism and racial discrimination should be addressed. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Depression; Ethnicity; New Zealand; Perceived stress; Postnatal; Prenatal; Racial discrimination,cohort analysis; ethnicity; maternal effect; mental health; parentage; racial disparity; racism; adult; Article; Asian; cohort analysis; depression; ethnic difference; ethnicity; female; human; human needs; maternal welfare; mental health; motivation; New Zealand; personal experience; prenatal depression; prenatal stress; prevalence; priority journal; puerperal depression; racism; New Zealand,2-s2.0-84994868769

Inflammation is thought to be a driver of BBB breakdown, but the underlying mechanisms for this are unclear. Brain pericytes are critical cells for maintaining the BBB and are immunologically active. We sought to test the hypothesis that inflammation regulates the BBB by altering pericyte biology. Methods: We exposed primary adult human brain pericytes to chronic interferon-gamma (IFNγ) for 4 days and measured associated functional aspects of pericyte biology. Specifically, we examined the influence of inflammation on platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFRβ) expression and signalling, as well as pericyte proliferation and migration by qRT-PCR, immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and western blotting. Results: Chronic IFNγ treatment had marked effects on pericyte biology most notably through the PDGFRβ, by enhancing agonist (PDGF-BB)-induced receptor phosphorylation, internalization, and subsequent degradation. Functionally, chronic IFNγ prevented PDGF-BB-mediated pericyte proliferation and migration. Conclusions: Because PDGFRβ is critical for pericyte function and its removal leads to BBB leakage, our results pinpoint a mechanism linking chronic brain inflammation to BBB dysfunction. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Blood-brain barrier; Inflammation; Migration; Proliferation,gamma interferon; platelet derived growth factor beta receptor; adult; Article; blood brain barrier; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; female; flow cytometry; growth inhibition; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; internalization; intracellular signaling; male; migration inhibition; pericyte; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein phosphorylation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting,2-s2.0-84988527691

However substrate selectivity is compromised due to metabolism by the human one- and two-electron oxidoreductases cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR) and aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3). Using rational drug design we developed a novel mono-nitro analog of PR-104A that is essentially free of this off-target activity in vitro and in vivo. Unlike PR-104A, there was no biologically relevant cytotoxicity in cells engineered to express AKR1C3 or POR, under aerobic or anoxic conditions, respectively. We screened this inert prodrug analog, SN34507, against a type I bacterial nitroreductase library and identified E. coli NfsA as an efficient bioactivator using a DNA damage response assay and recombinant enzyme kinetics. Expression of E. coli NfsA in human colorectal cancer cells led to selective cytotoxicity to SN34507 that was associated with cell cycle arrest and generated a robust ‘bystander effect’ at tissue-like cell densities when only 3% of cells were NfsA positive. Anti-tumor activity of SN35539, the phosphate pre-prodrug of SN34507, was established in ‘mixed’ tumors harboring a minority of NfsA-positive cells and demonstrated marked tumor control following heterogeneous suicide gene expression. These experiments demonstrate that off-target metabolism of PR-104 can be avoided and identify the suicide gene/prodrug partnership of E. coli NfsA/SN35539 as a promising combination for development in armed vectors. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Aldo-keto reductase 1C3; Alkylation; Hypoxia; Oxidoreductase; Prodrug,"bacterial enzyme; cytotoxic agent; drug analog; nitroreductase; pr 104; prodrug; sn 34507; sn 35539; unclassified drug; 15 hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase; 3(or 17)beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; AKR1C3 protein, human; alkylating agent; benzamide derivative; enzyme inhibitor; Escherichia coli protein; mesylic acid derivative; NfsA protein, E coli; phosphonic acid derivative; prodrug; recombinant protein; SN34507; SN35539; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; bystander effect; cancer control; cancer inhibition; cancer size; cancer survival; cell cycle arrest; cell density; cell viability; colorectal cancer; controlled study; DNA replication; drug design; drug efficacy; drug metabolism; drug screening; drug synthesis; enzyme kinetics; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme prodrug therapy; Escherichia coli; gene expression; HCT116 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; maximum tolerated dose; median survival time; molecular docking; mouse; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; protein expression; restriction site; single drug dose; steady state; suicide gene; weight reduction; X ray crystallography; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; carcinoma; cell proliferation; chemistry; Colorectal Neoplasms; drug effects; drug resistance; enzyme specificity; genetics; germfree animal; HCT 116 cell line; metabolic activation; metabolism; molecular model; nude mouse; pathology; randomization; survival analysis; tumor volume; 3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Activation, Metabolic; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating; Benzamides; Carcinoma; Cell Proliferation; Colorectal Neoplasms; Drug Design; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Enzyme Inhibitors; Escherichia coli Proteins; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases; Mesylates; Mice, Nude; Models, Molecular; Molecular Docking Simulation; Nitroreductases; Organophosphonates; Prodrugs; Random Allocation; Recombinant Proteins; Specific Pathogen-Free Organisms; Substrate Specificity; Survival Analysis; Tumor Burden; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84983792029

In 2011, Pacific Forum Leaders declared ""a human, social and economic crisis"" due to the significant and growing burden of NCDs in the region. In 2013, Pacific Health Ministers' commitment to 'whole of government' strategy prompted calls for the development of a robust, sustainable, collaborative NCD monitoring and accountability system to track, review and propose remedial action to ensure progress towards the NCD goals and targets. The purpose of this paper is to describe a regional, collaborative framework for coordination, innovation and application of NCD monitoring activities at scale, and to show how they can strengthen accountability for action on NCDs in the Pacific. A key component is the Dashboard for NCD Action which aims to strengthen mutual accountability by demonstrating national and regional progress towards agreed NCD policies and actions. Discussion: The framework for the Pacific Monitoring Alliance for NCD Action (MANA) draws together core country-level components of NCD monitoring data (mortality, morbidity, risk factors, health system responses, environments, and policies) and identifies key cross-cutting issues for strengthening national and regional monitoring systems. These include: capacity building; a regional knowledge exchange hub; innovations (monitoring childhood obesity and food environments); and a robust regional accountability system. The MANA framework is governed by the Heads of Health and operationalised by a multi-agency technical Coordination Team. Alliance membership is voluntary and non-conditional, and aims to support the 22 Pacific Island countries and territories to improve the quality of NCD monitoring data across the region. In establishing a common vision for NCD monitoring, the framework combines data collected under the WHO Global Framework for NCDs with a set of action-orientated indicators captured in a NCD Dashboard for Action. Summary: Viewing NCD monitoring as a multi-component system and providing a robust, transparent mutual accountability mechanism helps align agendas, roles and responsibilities of countries and support organisations. The dashboard provides a succinct communication tool for reporting progress on implementation of agreed policies and actions and its flexible methodology can be easily expanded, or adapted for other regions. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Dashboard; Monitoring and accountability; Non communicable diseases; Pacific; Policy,"capacity building; chronic disease; health survey; human; Pacific islands; premature mortality; procedures; risk factor; social behavior; trends; Capacity Building; Chronic Disease; Humans; Mortality, Premature; Pacific Islands; Public Health Surveillance; Risk Factors; Social Responsibility",2-s2.0-84992220318

This qualitative study explored the views of patients, to elicit information regarding factors influencing medicine sharing behaviours, their experiences of the consequences of prescription medicine sharing, and their risk assessment strategies when deciding to share. Methods: One-on-one, face-to-face, semi-structured interviews were carried out in Auckland, New Zealand between September 2013 and August 2014 with 17 patients, purposively sampled to provide information from different socio-demographic backgrounds. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a general inductive approach. The study received ethical approval, and all interviewees provided written informed consent. Results: Findings were captured within five overarching themes: types of shared medicines; perceived benefits of sharing medicines; negative experiences of sharing; factors influencing sharing behaviours; and risk assessment strategies. Participants reported that sharing helped them to avoid treatment costs and the inconvenience associated with medical visits such as booking appointments. Conversely, unanticipated side effects, allergies, and taking inappropriate medicines were the main adverse consequences of sharing. Altruism, limited access to medicines/health services, sociocultural factors, and having unused prescription medicines were factors influencing sharing behaviours. Participants reported assessing the safety of sharing a medicine primarily based on symptom matching, past illness experiences, and knowledge about the medicines. Conclusions: This study enriches previous survey findings, by providing insight into patients' reasons for medicines sharing. Healthcare providers should consider asking their patients about any medicines they have shared and their future sharing intentions, in order to use the opportunity for discussing safer sharing practices, without promoting the behaviour. The findings are helpful for informing the development of potential interventions and targeted educational messages about safe medicine use for patients. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Auckland; Medicine borrowing; Medicine lending; Medicine sharing; Non-recreational sharing,acetylsalicylic acid; amoxicillin; analgesic agent; antiallergic agent; antiasthmatic agent; antibiotic agent; antidiarrheal agent; antiemetic agent; antihistaminic agent; antihypertensive agent; antiinflammatory agent; antipsoriasis agent; botulinum toxin A; codeine; glipizide; glucosamine; homeopathic agent; hypnotic agent; metformin; morphine; muscle relaxant agent; nose spray; omeprazole; oral contraceptive agent; pethidine; salbutamol; simvastatin; sumatriptan; tramadol; unindexed drug; adult; aged; allergy; altruism; Article; clinical article; controlled study; demography; drug dependence; ethnicity; female; health belief; health care access; health hazard; household income; human; inappropriate prescribing; knowledge; male; medicine borrowing; medicine lending; medicine sharing; New Zealand; New Zealander; personal experience; prescription; prescription medicine sharing; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; risk assessment; semi structured interview; social aspect; social support; symptomatology,2-s2.0-84986628304

Current strategies employed to increase detection of early, curable stages of this disease are contributing to a reduction of the negative health impact from it. While there is a genetic component to the risk of disease, diet and environment are known to have major effects on the risk of an individual for developing the disease. However, there is the potential to reduce the impact of this disease further by preventing disease development. Biomarkers which can either predict the risk for or early stages of colorectal cancer could allow intervention at a time when prospects could be modified by environmental factors, including lifestyle and diet choices. Thus, such biomarkers could be used to identify high risk individuals who would benefit from lifestyle and dietary interventions to prevent this disease. This review will give an overview on one type of biomarker in the form of microRNAs, which have the potential to predict an individual's risk for colorectal cancer, as well as providing a highly sensitive and non-invasive warning of disease presence and/or progression. MicroRNA biomarkers which have been studied and whose levels look promising for this purpose include MiR- 18a, MiR-21, MiR-92a, MiR-135b, MiR-760, MiR-601. Not only have several individual microRNAs appeared promising as biomarkers, but panels of these may be even more useful. Furthermore, understanding dietary sources and ways of dietary modulation of these microRNAs might be fruitful in reducing the incidence and slowing the progression of colorectal cancer. ? 2016 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

METHODS: A total of 11 145 patients were randomized to cangrelor or clopidogrel in the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial (Cangrelor versus Standard Therapy to Achieve Optimal Management of Platelet Inhibition). We explored the effects of cangrelor on myocardial infarction (MI) using different definitions and performed sensitivity analyses on the primary end point of the trial. RESULTS: A total of 462 patients (4.2%) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention had an MI as defined by the second universal definition. The majority of these MIs (n=433, 93.7%) were type 4a. Treatment with cangrelor reduced the incidence of MI at 48 hours (3.8% versus 4.7%; odds ratio [OR], 0.80; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.67-0.97; P=0.02). When the Society of Coronary Angiography and Intervention definition of periprocedural MI was applied to potential ischemic events, there were fewer total MIs (n=134); however, the effects of cangrelor on MI remained significant (OR, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.46-0.92; P=0.01). Similar effects were seen in the evaluation of the effects of cangrelor on MIs with peak creatinine kinase-MB ?10 times the upper limit of normal (OR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.45-0.91) and those with peak creatinine kinase-MB ?10 times the upper limit of normal, ischemic symptoms, or ECG changes (OR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.48-0.84). MIs defined by any of these definitions were associated with increased risk of death at 30 days. Treatment with cangrelor reduced the composite end point of death, MI (Society of Coronary Angiography and Intervention definition), ischemia-driven revascularization, or Academic Research Consortium definite stent thrombosis (1.4% versus 2.1%; OR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.51-0.92). CONCLUSIONS: MI in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, regardless of definition, remains associated with increased risk of death in the current era. Cangrelor compared with clopidogrel significantly reduces MI regardless of the definition. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: http://clinicaltrials.gov.

Methods In a prospective Singaporean birth cohort study, pregnant women were screened for gestational diabetes at 26-28 weeks gestation using a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. Four hundred and seventy three children (n = 74 and n = 399 born to mothers with and without gestational diabetes respectively) underwent neurocognitive assessments at 6, 18, and/or 24 month, including electrophysiology during an attentional task and behavioral measures of attention, memory and cognition. Results Gestational diabetes is related to left hemisphere EPmax amplitude differences (oddball versus standard) at both six (P = 0.039) and eighteen months (P = 0.039), with mean amplitudes suggesting offspring of mothers with gestational diabetes exhibit greater neuronal activity to standard stimuli and less to oddball stimuli. Associations between 2-hour maternal glucose levels and the difference in EPmax amplitude were marginal at 6 months [adjusted β = -0.19 (95% CI: -0.42 to +0.04) μV, P = 0.100] and significant at 18 months [adjusted β = -0.27 (95% CI: -0.49 to -0.06) μV, P = 0.014], and the EPmax amplitude difference (oddball-standard) associated with the Bayley Scales of Infant and toddler Development-III cognitive score at 24 months [β = 0.598 (95% CI: 0.158 to 1.038), P = 0.008]. Conclusion Gestational diabetes and maternal blood glucose levels are associated with offspring neuronal activity during an attentional task at both six and eighteen months. Such electrophysiological differences are likely functionally important, having been previously linked to attention problems later in life. ? 2016 Cai et al.

Methods and results: Computed tomographic angiograms from 300 adults with a zero calcium score and no stenoses were segmented for centreline and luminal models. A computational atlas was constructed enabling automatic quantification of 3D angles, diameters and lengths of the coronary tree. The diameter (mean±SD) of the left main coronary was 3.5±0.8 mm and the length 10.5±5.3 mm. The left main bifurcation angle (distal angle or angle B) was 89±21° for cases with, and 75±23° for those without an intermediate artery (p<0.001). Analogous measurements of diameter and angle were tabulated for the other major bifurcations (left anterior descending/diagonal, circumflex/obtuse marginal and right coronary crux). Novel 3D angle definitions are proposed and analysed. Conclusions: A computational atlas of normal coronary artery anatomy provides distributions of diameter, lengths and bifurcation angles as well as more complex shape analysis. These data define normal anatomical variation, facilitating stent design, selection and optimal treatment strategy. These population models are necessary for accurate computational flow dynamics, can be 3D printed for bench testing bifurcation stents and deployment strategies, and can aid in the discussion of different approaches to the treatment of coronary bifurcations. ? 2016 Europa Digital & Publishing.

However, the reliability of that activation, its localization within the cerebellum, and its relationship to other areas of the AM network remains unknown. The current study used Activation Likelihood Estimation meta-analysis (ALE) as well as resting-state and task-related functional connectivity analyses to better characterize cerebellar activation in relation to AM. The ALE meta-analysis was run on 32 neuroimaging studies of AM retrieval. The results revealed a cluster of reliable AM-related activity within the Crus I lobule of the right posterior cerebellum. Using the peak ALE coordinate within Crus I as a seed region, both task-related and resting state functional connectivity analyses were run on fMRI data from 38 healthy participants. To determine the specificity of connectivity patterns to Crus I, we also included a cerebellar seed region in right Lobule VI previously identified in an ALE meta-analysis as associated with working memory. Resting-state functional connectivity analyses indicated that Crus I was intrinsically connected with other areas of the AM network as well as surrounding and contralateral cerebellar regions. In contrast, the Lobule VI seed was functionally connected with cerebral and cerebellar regions typically associated with working memory. The task-related connectivity analyses revealed a similar pattern, where the Crus I seed exhibited significant connectivity with key nodes of the AM network while the Lobule IV seed did not. During a semantic control task, both Crus I and Lobule VI showed significant correlations with a network of regions that was largely distinct from the AM network. Together these results indicate that right Crus I lobule is reliably engaged during AM retrieval and is functionally connected to the AM network both during rest, and more importantly, during AM retrieval. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Activation-Likelihood Estimation; Autobiographical memory; Cerebellum; Connectivity; FMRI,"autobiographical memory; cerebellum; controlled study; functional connectivity; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; information retrieval; meta analysis; neuroimaging; normal human; plant seed; rest; statistical model; working memory; adolescent; bibliographic database; blood; brain mapping; cerebellum; diagnostic imaging; episodic memory; female; image processing; male; meta analysis (topic); nerve tract; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; recall; statistics and numerical data; young adult; oxygen; Adolescent; Brain Mapping; Cerebellum; Databases, Bibliographic; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Likelihood Functions; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Episodic; Mental Recall; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Neural Pathways; Oxygen; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84989924800

Clinical studies found that the circulating levels of adiponectin, a peptide secreted from adipocytes, are inversely related to visceral fat mass and bone mineral density, and it has been suggested that adiponectin contributes to the coupling between fat and bone. Our study tested the hypothesis that adiponectin affects bone tissue by comparing the bone phenotype of wild-type and adiponectin-knockout (APN-KO) female mice between the ages of 8-37 weeks. Using a longitudinal study design, we determined body composition and bone density using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. In parallel, groups of animals were killed at different ages and bone properties were analyzed by microcomputed tomography, dynamic histomorphometry, 3-point bending test, nanoindentation, and computational modelling. APN-KO mice had reduced body fat and decreased whole-skeleton bone mineral density. Microcomputed tomography analysis identified reduced cortical area fraction and average cortical thickness in APN-KO mice in all the age groups and reduced trabecular bone volume fraction only in young APN-KO mice. There were no major differences in bone strength and material properties between the 2 groups. Taken together, our results demonstrate a positive effect of adiponectin on bone geometry and density in our mouse model. Assuming adiponectin has similar effects in humans, the low circulating levels of adiponectin associated with increased fat mass are unlikely to contribute to the parallel increase in bone mass.

Methods We randomised M?ori and non-M?ori primary care patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease (either because of a prior event or with an estimated 5-year risk of a first event of at least 15%) to a polypill (containing aspirin, statin and two antihypertensives) or usual care for a minimum of 12 months. All patients had indications for all polypill components according to their general practitioner, and all medications (including the polypill) were prescribed by the patient's general practitioner and dispensed at community pharmacies. The main outcome for this study was the use of all recommended medications (antiplatelet, statin and two antihypertensives) at 12 months. Heterogeneity in the effect of polypill-based care compared with usual care on this outcome by ethnicity was assessed by logistic regression. Results Baseline use of recommended medications was 36% (93/257) among M?ori and 51% (130/156) among non-M?ori participants. Polypill-based care was associated with an increase in the use of recommended medications among M?ori (relative risk [RR]: 1.87; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.50-2.34) and non-M?ori (RR: 1.66; 95% CI: 1.37-2.00) when compared with usual care at 12 months, and there was no statistically significant heterogeneity in this outcome by ethnicity (p = 0.92). Conclusion Polypill-based care is likely to reduce absolute inequities between M?ori and non-M?ori in the use of recommended cardiovascular preventative medications given baseline absolute differences and the consistency of the proportional effect of this intervention by ethnicity in this pragmatic trial in primary care. ? 2016 European Society of Cardiology.",Cardiovascular diseases; ethnic groups; healthcare disparities; polypill; secondary prevention,acetylsalicylic acid; atenolol; cholesterol; hydrochlorothiazide; lisinopril; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; simvastatin; triacylglycerol; cardiovascular agent; adult; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug use; ethnicity; female; follow up; Framingham risk score; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); open study; polypharmacy; priority journal; prophylaxis; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; unspecified side effect; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial; drug combination; epidemiology; ethnic group; ethnology; middle aged; morbidity; multicenter study; New Zealand; retrospective study; risk assessment; time factor; trends; Cardiovascular Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; Drug Combinations; Ethnic Groups; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; New Zealand; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84984908026

Methods - The fourth Auckland Regional Community Stroke study (ARCOS IV) used multiple overlapping case ascertainment methods to identify all hospitalized and nonhospitalized cases of TIA that occurred in people ?16 years of age usually resident in Auckland (population ?16 years of age is 1.12 million), during the 12 months from March 1, 2011. All first-ever and recurrent new TIAs (any new TIA 28 days after the index event) during the study period were recorded. Results - There were 785 people with TIA (402 [51.2%] women, mean [SD] age 71.5 [13.8] years); 614 (78%) of European origin, 84 (11%) M?ori/Pacific, and 75 (10%) Asian/Other. The annual incidence of TIA was 40 (95% confidence interval, 36-43), and attack rate was 63 (95% confidence interval, 59-68), per 100 000 people, age standardized to the World Health Organization world population. Approximately two thirds of people were known to be hypertensive or were being treated with blood pressure-lowering agents, half were taking antiplatelet agents and just under half were taking lipid-lowering therapy before the index TIA. Two hundred ten (27%) people were known to have atrial fibrillation at the time of the TIA, of whom only 61 (29%) were taking anticoagulant therapy, suggesting a failure to identify or treat atrial fibrillation. Conclusions - This study describes the burden of TIA in an era of aggressive primary and secondary vascular risk factor management. Education programs for medical practitioners and patients around the identification and management of atrial fibrillation are required. ? 2016 American Heart Association, Inc.",anticoagulant; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular disorders; hypertension; incidence,"anticoagulant agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; antithrombocytic agent; adult; aged; anticoagulant therapy; antihypertensive therapy; Asian; atrial fibrillation; diabetes mellitus; ethnic difference; European; female; human; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); middle aged; New Zealand; priority journal; Review; transient ischemic attack; adolescent; Ischemic Attack, Transient; New Zealand; register; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Incidence; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Registries; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84983637922

This paper brings 20 families’ mundane outdoor play experiences in Auckland's temperate climate to the fore. Through drawings and interviews, families residing in both suburban detached houses and central city apartments revealed locally constituted beliefs about appropriate play spaces (e.g. garden, park). While the majority of participants retreated to indoor activities during winter, some children and their parents viewed the outdoors as the only opportunity for ‘real fun’. We advocate the importance of a better understanding of children's seasonal outdoor play. In particular, we argue that in order to promote year-round healthy levels of outdoor activities it is necessary to understand variations in societal, neighbourhood and family values attributed to outdoor activities. Further, to develop a more nuanced understanding of the locational complexities of outdoor play it is important to understand the meanings of, and practices associated with, seasonal and weather conditions in different international locations. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Obesity; Play; Qualitative; Seasonality; Urban intensification,"child health; lifestyle; obesity; outdoor recreation; physical activity; play; qualitative analysis; seasonality; urban area; weather; adult; Article; child; climate; female; health promotion; human; leisure; lifestyle; male; neighborhood; New Zealander; parental behavior; physical activity; play; priority journal; recreation; recreational park; school child; seasonal variation; social environment; suburban population; weather; child behavior; child parent relation; city; comparative study; demography; health promotion; interview; lifestyle; middle aged; New Zealand; parent; psychology; recreation; recreational park; season; socioeconomics; urban population; weather; Auckland; New Zealand; North Island; Adult; Child; Child Behavior; Cities; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Parent-Child Relations; Parents; Parks, Recreational; Play and Playthings; Residence Characteristics; Seasons; Socioeconomic Factors; Urban Population; Weather",2-s2.0-84983488665

Methods We conducted an individual participant data meta-analysis of three trials including patients from Australia, England, India, Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand that compared a strategy using a polypill containing aspirin, statin and antihypertensive therapy with usual care in patients with a prior CVD event or who were at high risk of their first event. Analyses investigated any differential effect on anthropometric measures and self-reported lifestyle behaviours. Results Among 3140 patients (75% male, mean age 62 years and 76% with a prior CVD event) there was no difference in lifestyle risk factors in those randomised to polypill-based care compared with usual care over a median of 15 months, either across all participants combined, or in a range of subgroups. Furthermore, narrow confidence intervals (CIs) excluded any major effect; for example differences between the groups in body mass index was -0.1 (95% CI -0.2 to 0.1) kg/m2, in weekly duration of moderate intensity physical activity was -2 (-26 to 23) minutes and the proportion of smokers was 16% vs 17% (RR 0.98, 0.84 to 1.15) at the end of trial. Discussion This analysis allays concern that polypill-based care may lead to neglect of lifestyle risk factors, at least among high-risk patients. Maximally effective preventive approaches should address lifestyle factors alongside pharmaceutical interventions, as recommended by major international guidelines. ?

The Social Disorganization Theory suggests that neighborhood-level disadvantage may reduce collective efficacy to control adolescent risky behavior. Collective perceptions of physical disorder are also implicated in this neighborhood pathway. Drawing on data from a nationally-representative survey of urban high school students in New Zealand, multilevel path analysis was used to estimate the direct and mediating effects of neighborhood disadvantage, physical disorder, and collective efficacy on current drinking, frequency of binge drinking, and typical quantity of alcohol consumed. The findings supported an indirect pathway from disadvantage to binge drinking and high typical quantities in young adolescents (<16 years), mediated by physical disorder and reduced collective efficacy. Collective efficacy was not associated with current drinking in young adolescents. An opposing indirect effect was evident among older adolescents (?16 years), whereby collective efficacy was positively associated with drinking outcomes.

The aim of this study was to measure esophageal transit of liquid, paste, and pill during upright videofluoroscopy. Methods: One hundred eighteen healthy adults (mean age 54; range 20-98 years; SD = 21.40) with no complaints of dysphagia completed a videofluoroscopy with esophageal visualization including 20 ml liquid barium, 5 ml paste, and pill. Results: Mean ETTs were: 20 ml fluid, 10.7 seconds (SD = 13.6, median = 5.76, IQR = 4.33, range, 2.0-60.0); pill, 25.3 seconds (SD = 24.0, median = 12.70, IQR = 49.81, range, 1.0-60.0); paste, 28.6 seconds (SD = 23.31, median = 17.47, IQR = 53, range, 4.0-60.0). Age was significantly associated with increasing 20 ml fluid ETT (P <.001) but not pill (P =.58) or paste ETT (P =.12). Fluid ETT over 10 seconds occurred in 10% of participants between 20 and 59 years, in comparison to 35% over 60 years (P <.001). Conclusions: These normative values provide a standardized protocol and guidance in interpretation when completing esophageal visualization as part of videofluoroscopy. While measuring fluid ETT may support referral for further specialist investigations, slower paste and pill ETT may be normal findings. Age-related slowing in fluid ETT was seen in healthy adults. Further investigation of ETT is needed in both normal and dysphagic subjects. ?

However, neurodegeneration typically manifests in HD only in middle age, and mechanisms linking the causative mutation to brain disease are poorly understood. Brain metabolism is severely perturbed in HD, and some studies have indicated a potential role for mutant Htt as a driver of these metabolic aberrations. Here, our objective was to determine the effects of HD on brain metabolism by measuring levels of polar metabolites in regions known to undergo varying degrees of damage. We performed gas-chromatography/mass spectrometry-based metabolomic analyses in a case-control study of eleven brain regions in short post-mortem-delay human tissue from nine well-characterized HD patients and nine matched controls. In each patient, we measured metabolite content in representative tissue-samples from eleven brain regions that display varying degrees of damage in HD, thus identifying the presence and abundance of 63 different metabolites from several molecular classes, including carbohydrates, amino acids, nucleosides, and neurotransmitters. Robust alterations in regional brain-metabolite abundances were observed in HD patients: these included changes in levels of small molecules that play important roles as intermediates in the tricarboxylic-acid and urea cycles, and amino-acid metabolism. Our findings point to widespread disruption of brain metabolism and indicate a complex phenotype beyond the gradient of neuropathologic damage observed in HD brain. ? 2016 The Authors.",Brain urea metabolism; Huntington's disease; Inositol pathway; Metabolic brain disease; Neurodegenerative disease; Polyol pathway,4 aminobutyric acid; 4 hydroxybutyric acid; alanine; aromatic amino acid; aspartic acid; beta alanine; cysteine; fructose; glucose; glutamine; isoleucine; leucine; lysine; malic acid; methionine; n acetylglutamic acid; neurotransmitter; nucleoside; phenylalanine; polyglutamine; proline; pyroglutamic acid; serine; sorbitol; threonine; tricarboxylic acid; tryptophan; tyrosine; unindexed drug; valine; aged; amino acid metabolism; Article; autopsy; basal ganglion; brain metabolism; brain region; CAG repeat; carbohydrate metabolism; case control study; cerebellum; cingulate gyrus; controlled study; energy resource; energy transfer; entorhinal cortex; female; globus pallidus; hippocampus; human; human tissue; Huntington chorea; male; mass fragmentography; metabolite; metabolomics; middle frontal gyrus; middle temporal gyrus; motor cortex; priority journal; putamen; sensory cortex; substantia nigra; urea cycle,2-s2.0-84973452248

PTX is used in combination with other drugs in both the adjuvant setting and in advanced breast cancer. Because a proportion of patients respond poorly to PTX or relapse after its use, a greater understanding of the mechanisms conferring resistance to PTX is required. One protein shown to be involved in drug resistance is Y-box binding protein 1 (YB-1). High levels of YB-1 have previously been associated with resistance to PTX in TNBCs. In this study, we aimed to determine mechanisms by which YB-1 confers PTX resistance. We generated isogenic TNBC cell lines that differed by YB-1 levels and treated these with PTX. Using microarray analysis, we identified EGR1 as a potential target of YB-1. We found that low EGR1 mRNA levels are associated with poor breast cancer patient prognosis, and that EGR1 and YBX1 mRNA expression was inversely correlated in a TNBC line and in a proportion of TNBC tumours. Reducing the levels of EGR1 caused TNBC cells to become more resistant to PTX. Given that PTX targets cycling cells, we propose a model whereby high YB-1 levels in some TNBC cells can lead to reduced levels of EGR1, which in turn promotes slow cell cycling and resistance to PTX. Therefore YB-1 and EGR1 levels are biologically linked and may provide a biomarker for TNBC response to PTX. ? 2016 UICC.",ABCB1; DUSP4; early growth response 1; MDR1; Y-box binding protein 1,"early growth response factor 1; messenger RNA; paclitaxel; Y box binding protein 1; antineoplastic agent; early growth response factor 1; messenger RNA; paclitaxel; Y box binding protein 1; Article; breast cancer cell line; cancer resistance; chemosensitivity; controlled study; EGR1 gene; gene expression; human; major clinical study; microarray analysis; priority journal; protein function; YBX1 gene; drug resistance; female; gene expression profiling; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; mortality; prognosis; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Cell Line, Tumor; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Early Growth Response Protein 1; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Paclitaxel; Prognosis; RNA, Messenger; Triple Negative Breast Neoplasms; Y-Box-Binding Protein 1",2-s2.0-84971268127

Socially assistive robotics is challenging as it is required to move robots out of laboratories and industrial settings to interact with ordinary human beings as peers, which requires social skills. The design process usually requires multidisciplinary research teams, which may comprise subject matter experts from various domains such as robotics, systems integration, medicine, psychology, gerontology, social and cognitive sciences, and neuroscience, among many others. Unlike most other robotic applications, socially assistive robotics faces some unique software and systems integration challenges. In this paper, the HealthBot robot architecture, which was designed to overcome these challenges, is presented. The presented architecture was implemented and used in several field trials.

While commonly described in the neurogenic niches of the adult human brain, there is limited evidence of its distribution in other brain regions. PSA-NCAM is an important regulator of cell-cell interactions and facilitates cell migration and plasticity. Recent evidence suggests these functions may be altered in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). This study provides a detailed description of the PSA-NCAM distribution throughout the human brain and quantitatively compares the staining load in cortical regions and sub-cortical structures between the control, AD and PD brain. Our results provide evidence of widespread, yet specific, PSA-NCAM expression throughout the human brain including regions devoid of PSA-NCAM in the rodent brain such as the caudate nucleus (CN) and cerebellum (CB). We also detected a significant reduction in PSA-NCAM load in the entorhinal cortex (EC) of cases that was inversely correlated with hyperphosphorylated tau load. These results demonstrate that PSA-NCAM-mediated structural plasticity may not be limited to neurogenic niches and is conserved in the aged brain. We also provide evidence that PSA-NCAM is reduced in the EC, a region severely affected by AD pathology. ? 2016 IBRO.",Alzheimer's disease; Neural cell adhesion molecule; Parkinson's disease; Plasticity; Polysialic acid; Tau,"amyloid beta protein; glycoprotein; polysialated neural cell adhesion molecule; unclassified drug; nerve cell adhesion molecule L1; polysialyl neural cell adhesion molecule; sialic acid derivative; Alzheimer disease; Article; brain region; caudate nucleus; cell body; cell population; cerebellum; corpus striatum; entorhinal cortex; hippocampal CA1 region; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; interneuron; Parkinson disease; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; Purkinje cell; stratum pyramidale; substantia nigra pars compacta; substantia nigra pars reticulata; aged; Alzheimer disease; brain; comparative study; enzyme immunoassay; female; fluorescent antibody technique; male; metabolism; middle aged; Parkinson disease; pathology; very elderly; Western blotting; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Blotting, Western; Brain; Female; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule L1; Parkinson Disease; Sialic Acids",2-s2.0-84975215492

Methods: Longitudinal study of 109 children aged between 8–16 years who had experienced a mild TBI, with an embedded case control study. Parents completed assessments of the child’s sleep quality, symptoms and behaviour at baseline, 1, 6 and 12 months post-injury. Regression analyses explored the impact of poor sleep on 12-month outcomes. Healthy control children were assessed at one time point for comparison to determine the longer-term impact of brain injury on sleep. Results: The number of children experiencing poor sleep quality peaked 1-month post-injury (39%), reducing to 28% 12-months post-injury. Poor sleep quality at 1-month was associated with increased frequency and severity of symptoms and poorer behavioural outcomes 1 year post-TBI. Cases with TBI were significantly more likely to have sleep difficulties 1-year post-injury than controls (Odds ratio = 3.09). Conclusions: Sleep difficulties are common following mild TBI in children and are predictive of longer-term outcomes.

Despite the fact that they provide the majority of direct care for residents, little is known about a key care aspect of their work, namely their experience of caring for dying residents. Methods: Twenty-six Health Care Assistants working in aged residential care facilities in Auckland, New Zealand participated in six focus group discussions. Focus groups were designed to explore the experiences of Health Care Assistants caring for imminently dying residents in aged care facilities and to identify barriers and facilitators to their work in this area. The focus groups were digitally recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a general inductive approach. Results: Participants confirmed that Health Care Assistants provide the majority of hands on care to dying residents and believed they had a valuable role to play at this time due to their unique 'familial' relationship with residents and families. However, it was apparent that a number of barriers existed to them maximising their contribution to supporting dying residents, most notably the lack of value placed on their knowledge and experience by other members of the multidisciplinary team. Whilst a need for additional palliative and end of life care education was identified, a preference was identified for hands on education delivered by peers, rather than the didactic education they currently receive. Conclusion: Given ageing populations internationally coupled with a constrained health budget, the role of Health Care Assistants in most developed countries is likely to become even more significant in the short to medium term. This study makes a unique contribution to the international literature by identifying the barriers to caring for dying residents experienced by this valuable sector of the aged care workforce. These data have the potential to inform new, innovative, interventions to address the urgent need identified to improve palliative and end of life care management in aged care internationally. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Aged residential care; Care home; Dying; End of life; Health care assistant; Nursing home; Older people; Palliative; Residential aged care settings,aging; budget; developed country; DNA transcription; doctor patient relation; education; family; human; human experiment; information processing; New Zealand; nursing home; resident; residential care; terminal care; voice; adolescent; adult; aged; caregiver; clinical competence; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; home for the aged; human relation; middle aged; nursing home; psychology; satisfaction; standards; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Caregivers; Clinical Competence; Focus Groups; Health Personnel; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Nursing Homes; Personal Satisfaction; Professional-Family Relations; Terminal Care; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84982273197

A series of water-soluble 3-trifluoromethyl (4-10), 3-phenyl (11-19), and 3-methyl (20-21) substituted QDO compounds were designed to span a range of electron affinities consistent with bioreduction. The stoichiometry of loss of QDOs by steady-state radiolysis of anaerobic aqueous formate buffer indicated that one-electron reduction of QDOs generates radicals able to initiate chain reactions by oxidation of formate. The 3-trifluoromethyl analogues exhibited long chain reactions consistent with the release of the HO?, as identified in EPR spin trapping experiments. Several carbon-centered radical intermediates, produced by anaerobic incubation of the QDO compounds with N-terminal truncated cytochrome P450 reductase (POR), were characterized using N-tert-butyl-α-phenylnitrone (PBN) and 5-(diethoxyphosphoryl)-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DEPMPO) spin traps and were observed by EPR. Experimental data were well simulated for the production of strongly oxidizing radicals, capable of H atom abstraction from methyl groups. The kinetics of formation and decay of the radicals produced following one-electron reduction of the parent compounds, both in oxic and anoxic solutions, were determined using pulse radiolysis. Back oxidation of the initially formed radical anions by molecular oxygen did not compete effectively with the breakdown of the radical anions to form oxidizing radicals. The QDO compounds displayed low hypoxic selectivity when tested against oxic and hypoxic cancer cell lines in vitro.

Despite great worldwide efforts in preterm birth prevention, there are no recent effective therapeutic strategies able to decrease spontaneous preterm birth rates or their consequent neonatal morbidity/mortality. The Preterm SAMBA study will associate metabolomics technologies to identify clinical and metabolite predictors for preterm birth. These innovative and unbiased techniques might be a strategic key to advance spontaneous preterm birth prediction. Methods/design: Preterm SAMBA study consists of a discovery phase to identify biophysical and untargeted metabolomics from blood and hair samples associated with preterm birth, plus a validation phase to evaluate the performance of the predictive modelling. The first phase, a case-control study, will randomly select 100 women who had a spontaneous preterm birth (before 37 weeks) and 100 women who had term birth in the Cork Ireland and Auckland New Zealand cohorts within the SCOPE study, an international consortium aimed to identify potential metabolomic predictors using biophysical data and blood samples collected at 20 weeks of gestation. The validation phase will recruit 1150 Brazilian pregnant women from five participant centres and will collect blood and hair samples at 20 weeks of gestation to evaluate the performance of the algorithm model (sensitivity, specificity, predictive values and likelihood ratios) in predicting spontaneous preterm birth (before 34 weeks, with a secondary analysis of delivery before 37 weeks). Discussion: The Preterm SAMBA study intends to step forward on preterm birth prediction using metabolomics techniques, and accurate protocols for sample collection among multi-ethnic populations. The use of metabolomics in medical science research is innovative and promises to provide solutions for disorders with multiple complex underlying determinants such as spontaneous preterm birth. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Biological biomarker; Mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Prediction; Spontaneous preterm birth,"biological marker; biological marker; adult; Article; biophysics; Brazilian; case control study; controlled study; criterion variable; ethnicity; female; human; labor induction; lifestyle; major clinical study; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; phenotype; practice guideline; predictive value; premature labor; protein analysis; questionnaire; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; social status; validation study; algorithm; Brazil; clinical protocol; hair; Ireland; metabolism; New Zealand; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; prenatal diagnosis; procedures; risk factor; second trimester pregnancy; Algorithms; Biomarkers; Brazil; Case-Control Studies; Clinical Protocols; Female; Hair; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Ireland; Metabolomics; New Zealand; Predictive Value of Tests; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Premature Birth; Prenatal Diagnosis; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-84981273829

While adverse effects on cardiovascular health have also been linked with noise (after controlling for air pollution), noise exposure has been commonly linked to sleep impairment and negative emotional reactions. Health is multi-faceted, both conceptually and operationally; Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) is one of many measures capable of probing health. In this study, we examine pre-collected data from postal surveys probing HRQOL obtained from a variety of urban, suburban, and rural contexts across the North Island of New Zealand. Analyses focus on the covariance between air pollution annoyance and noise annoyances, and their independent and combined effects on HRQOL. Results indicate that the highest ratings of air pollution annoyance and noise annoyances were for residents living close to the motorway, while the lowest were for rural residents. Most of the city samples indicated no significant difference between air pollution-and noise-annoyance ratings, and of all of the correlations between air pollution-and noise-annoyance, the highest were found in the city samples. These findings suggest that annoyance is driven by exposure to environmental factors and not personality characteristics. Analysis of HRQOL indicated that air pollution annoyance predicts greater variability in the physical HRQOL domain while noise annoyance predicts greater variability in the psychological, social and environmental domains. The lack of an interaction effect between air pollution annoyance and noise annoyance suggests that air pollution and noise impact on health independently. These results echo those obtained from objective measures of health and suggest that mitigation of traffic effects should address both air and noise pollution. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Air pollution; Covariance; Environmental noise; Health related quality of life (HRQOL); Noise annoyance; Traffic,"atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; covariance analysis; environmental factor; health impact; noise pollution; quality of life; respiratory disease; risk factor; traffic emission; adult; aged; air pollution; annoyance; Article; city; controlled study; covariance; environmental factor; female; health impact assessment; health survey; highway; human; male; New Zealand; noise pollution; postal mail; quality of life; rural area; suburban area; traffic; urban area; adolescent; adverse effects; air pollution; environmental exposure; middle aged; noise; satisfaction; very elderly; young adult; New Zealand; North Island; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Noise; Personal Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84981489687

On average, the foods advertised during cartoon programming had the highest energy (367 kcal) and sugar (30.0 g) content, while foods advertised during sport programming had the highest amount of total fat (9.5 g) and sodium (412 mg) content. More than 60 % of the foods advertised did not meet any nutritional quality standards. 64.3 % of the products did not comply with the Mexican nutritional standards, as compared with 83.1 % and 78.7 % with WHO Europe and UKNPM standards, respectively. The food groups most frequently advertised were beverages (24.6 %), followed by chocolate and confectionery sugar (19.7 %), cakes, sweet biscuits and pastries (12.0 %), savory snacks (9.3 %), breakfast cereals (7.1 %), ready-made food (6.4 %) and dairy products (6.0 %). Conclusion: The majority of foods and beverages advertised on Mexican TV do not comply with any nutritional quality standards, and thus should not be marketed to children. The nutritional quality standards applied by the Mexican regulation are much weaker than those applied by the WHO Europe and United Kingdom. The Mexican government should improve the nutrition standards in its new regulation, especially the sugar cut off points. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Advertising; Food and beverages; Mexico; Nutrient profile models; Nutritional content; Television,"sodium intake; advertising; beverage; child; dairy product; diet; fast food; food; food industry; food packaging; food preference; human; Internet; marketing; Mexico; nutritional value; sodium intake; television; Advertising as Topic; Beverages; Child; Dairy Products; Diet; Food; Food Industry; Food Labeling; Food Preferences; Humans; Internet; Marketing; Mexico; Nutritive Value; Snacks; Sodium, Dietary; Television",2-s2.0-84982856684

However, ADT has well documented side effects that could alter the patient's health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The current study aims to test whether a genetic stratification could provide better knowledge for optimising ADT options to minimize HRQoL effects. Methods: A cohort of 206 PC survivors (75 treated with and 131 without ADT) was recruited with written consent to collect patient characteristics, clinical data and HRQoL data related to PC management. The primary outcomes were the percentage scores under each HRQoL subscale assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and PR25) and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scales developed by the University of Melbourne, Australia. Genotyping of these men was carried out for the aldo-keto reductase family 1, member C3 (AKR1C3) rs12529 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). Analysis of HRQoL scores were carried out against ADT duration and in association with the AKR1C3 rs12529 SNP using the generalised linear model. P-values <0 · 05 were considered significant, and were further tested for restriction with Bonferroni correction. Results: Increase in hormone treatment-related effects were recorded with long-term ADT compared to no ADT. The C and G allele frequencies of the AKR1C3rs12529 SNP were 53·4 % and 46·6 % respectively. Hormone treatment-related symptoms showed an increase with ADT when associated with the AKR1C3 rs12529 G allele. Meanwhile, decreasing trends on cancer-specific symptoms and increased sexual interest were recorded with no ADT when associated with the AKR1C3 rs12529 G allele and reverse trends with the C allele. As higher incidence of cancer-specific symptoms relate to cancer retention it is possible that associated with the C allele there could be higher incidence of unresolved cancers under no ADT options. Conclusions: If these findings can be reproduced in larger homogeneous cohorts, a genetic stratification based on the AKR1C3 rs12529 SNP, can minimize ADT-related HRQoL effects in PC patients. Our data additionally show that with this stratification it could also be possible to identify men needing ADT for better oncological advantage. ? 2016 The Author(s).",AKR1C3 rs12529 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP); Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); Health related quality of life (HRQoL),"aldo keto reductase family 1 member C3; antiandrogen; bicalutamide; cyproterone acetate; flutamide; gonadorelin agonist; goserelin; leuprorelin; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; 15 hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase; 3(or 17)beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; AKR1C3 protein, human; aldehyde reductase; antiandrogen; carbonyl reductase; gonadorelin; aged; androgen deprivation therapy; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer survivor; chronic drug administration; cohort analysis; controlled study; depression; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; drug effect; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire C30 subscale; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life questionnaire PR25 subscale; gene frequency; genetic association; genotype; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; New Zealand; prostate cancer; quality of life; quality of life assessment; sexual behavior; side effect; single nucleotide polymorphism; symptom; treatment duration; trend study; agonists; enzymology; genetics; Prostatic Neoplasms; very elderly; 3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aldehyde Reductase; Androgen Antagonists; Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone; Humans; Hydroxyprostaglandin Dehydrogenases; Male; New Zealand; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prostatic Neoplasms; Quality of Life",2-s2.0-84987984621

Over the past decade there has been an increasing trend to extending culture from cleavage-stage to blastocyst transfer. There has also been a trend to single ET and reporting the success of an assisted reproductive cycle as a cumulative live-birth rate after using both fresh and frozen embryos. There is low evidence that fresh blastocyst transfer is associated with improved live-birth rates compared with fresh cleavage-stage embryos. However, in the few studies that report cumulative pregnancy rates after fresh and frozen transfers, no significant difference was found. Cleavage-stage transfer is associated with greater numbers of embryos available for freezing, and blastocyst transfer is associated with increased number of cycles with no embryos to transfer. Further well-designed studies are warranted to evaluate the outcomes for blastocyst transfer including cumulative live-birth rate after fresh and frozen transfers, time to live birth, costs of the different transfer strategies, and perinatal mortality and severe perinatal morbidity. ? 2016 American Society for Reproductive Medicine",blastocyst; cleavage; Embryo transfer,"blastocyst; blastocyst transfer; cleavage stage transfer; cost effectiveness analysis; embryo culture; embryo transfer; freezing; human; infertility therapy; live birth; oocyte cleavage; oocyte retrieval; outcome assessment; perinatal morbidity; perinatal mortality; perinatal period; pregnancy outcome; pregnancy rate; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; treatment failure; adverse effects; blastocyst; chi square distribution; cost benefit analysis; cryopreservation; economics; embryo transfer; female; fertility; health care cost; in vitro fertilization; infertility; nidation; odds ratio; oocyte cleavage; pathology; pathophysiology; pregnancy; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; treatment outcome; Blastocyst; Chi-Square Distribution; Cleavage Stage, Ovum; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Cryopreservation; Embryo Culture Techniques; Embryo Implantation; Embryo Transfer; Female; Fertility; Fertilization in Vitro; Health Care Costs; Humans; Infertility; Live Birth; Odds Ratio; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Rate; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84991784095

Structured Operational Research and Training Initiative (SORT IT) courses have been developed to train participants to conduct and publish operational research and influence policy and practice. Twenty courses were completed in Asia, Africa, Europe and the South Pacific between 2009 and 2014. Objectives: In the 20 completed SORT IT courses, to assess where the research was conducted, who was trained, who became facilitators in subsequent courses and course outcomes. Design: A cohort study of completed SORT IT courses Results: There were 236 participants (41% female) including 64 nationalities who conducted research in 59 countries, mostly from Asia and Africa (mean course duration = 9.7 months). Most participants (68%) were from government health programs and non-governmental agencies. A total of 213(90%) participants completed all milestones successfully with 41 (19%) becoming subsequent course facilitators, 88% of whom were from LMICs. Of 228 manuscripts submitted to scientific journals, 197(86%) were either published or in press; in 86%, the principal investigator (first author) was a LMIC national. Papers were published in 23 scientific journals (impact factor 0.5-4.4) and covered 21 disease categories (median publication time = 5.7 months). Published papers (186) had 94,794 cumulative article views/downloads. Article views/downloads for immediate open access articles were double those from closed access journals. Conclusion: The SORT IT model has been effective in training personnel to produce relevant operational research in LMICs. It merits continued commitment and support for further scale-up and development. ? 2016 Zachariah et al.

There is growing recognition of the importance of influencing the training of adult physicians as well as paediatricians. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians (RACP) is responsible for overseeing all aspects of specialist physician training across the two countries. Following advocacy from adolescent physicians, the RACP is advancing a three-tier strategy to build greater specialist capacity and sustain leadership in adolescent and young adult medicine (AYAM). The first tier of the strategy supports universal training in adolescent and young adult health and medicine for all basic trainees in paediatric and adult medicine through an online training resource. The second and third tiers support advanced training in AYAM for specialist practice, based on an advanced training curriculum that has been approved by the RACP. The second tier is dual training; advanced trainees can undertake 2 years training in AYAM and 2 years training in another area of specialist practice. The third tier consists of 3 years of advanced training in AYAM. The RACP is currently seeking formal recognition from the Australian Government to have AYAM accredited, a process that will be subsequently undertaken in New Zealand. The RACP is expectant that the accreditation of specialist AYAM physicians will promote sustained academic and clinical leadership in AYAM to the benefit of future generations of young Australasians. ? 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",adolescent medicine; Australia; medical education; New Zealand; specialisation; Young adult medicine,"accreditation; adolescent; adult; Australia and New Zealand; college; curriculum; government; human; human experiment; investment; leadership; medical education; medicine; model; pediatrician; recognition; teaching; young adult; accreditation; adolescent health; Australia; education; New Zealand; nonbiological model; organization and management; procedures; social behavior; specialization; standards; trends; Accreditation; Adolescent; Adolescent Health; Adolescent Medicine; Australia; Curriculum; Education; Humans; Models, Organizational; New Zealand; Social Responsibility; Specialization",2-s2.0-84983335819

In comparison, the globus pallidus (GP), a main striatal output nucleus, has received less focus in HD research. This study characterizes the pattern of neurodegeneration in 3 subdivisions of the human GP, and its relation to clinical symptomatology. Methods: Stereology was used to measure regional atrophy, neuronal loss, and soma neuronal atrophy in 3 components of the GP—the external segment (GPe), internal segment (GPi), and ventral pallidum (VP)—in 8 HD cases compared with 7 matched control cases. The findings in the HD patients were compared with HD striatal neuropathological grade, and symptom scores of motor impairment, chorea, cognition, and mood. Results: Relative to controls, in the HD patients the GPe showed a 54% overall volume decline, 60% neuron loss, and 34% reduced soma volume. Similarly, the VP was reduced in volume by 31%, with 48% neuron loss and 64% reduced soma volume. In contrast, the GPi was less affected, with a 38% reduction in overall volume only. The extent of GP neurodegeneration correlated with increasing striatal neuropathological grade. Decreasing GPe and VP volumes were associated with poorer cognition and increasing motor impairments, but not chorea. In contrast, decreasing GPi volumes were associated with decreasing levels of irritability. Interpretation: The HD gene mutation produces variable degrees of GP segment degeneration, highlighting the differential vulnerability of striato-GP target projections. The relationship established between clinical symptom scores and pallidal degeneration provides a novel contribution to understanding the clinicopathological associations in HD.

As such, many countries are now developing national sodium reduction strategies, a key component of which is a sodium reduction model that includes sodium targets for packaged foods and other sources of dietary sodium. Objective: We sought to develop a sodium reduction model to determine the reductions required in the sodium content of packaged foods and other dietary sources of sodium to reduce adult population salt intake by ? 30% toward the optimal WHO target of 5 g/d. Design: Nationally representative household food-purchasing data for New Zealand were linked with branded food composition information to determine the mean contribution of major packaged food categories to total population sodium consumption. Discretionary salt use and the contribution of sodium from fresh foods and foods consumed away from the home were estimated with the use of national nutrition survey data. Reductions required in the sodium content of packaged foods and other dietary sources of sodium to achieve a 30% reduction in dietary sodium intakes were estimated. Results: A 36% reduction (1.6 g salt or 628 mg Na) in the sodium content of packaged foods in conjunction with a 40% reduction in discretionary salt use and the sodium content of foods consumed away from the home would reduce total population salt intake in New Zealand by 35% (from 8.4 to 5.5 g/d) and thus meet the WHO 2025 30% relative reduction target. Key reductions required include a decrease of 21% in the sodium content of white bread, 27% for hard cheese, 42% for sausages, and 54% for ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. Conclusions: Achieving the WHO sodium target in New Zealand will take considerable efforts by both food manufacturers and consumers and will likely require a national government-led sodium reduction strategy. ? 2016 American Society for Nutrition.",Chronic disease; Salt; Sodium; Target; WHO,"sodium; sodium chloride; salt intake; sodium intake; Article; bread; breakfast cereal; cheese; consumer; dietary supplement; food composition; food intake; food packaging; health survey; household; human; meat; nutrient content; nutritional assessment; population; risk reduction; salt intake; sodium intake; world health organization; administration and dosage; adult; analysis; catering service; diet; fast food; feeding behavior; food packaging; health promotion; New Zealand; nutrition; nutrition policy; sodium intake; theoretical model; Adult; Diet; Fast Foods; Feeding Behavior; Food Packaging; Health Promotion; Humans; Models, Theoretical; New Zealand; Nutrition Policy; Nutrition Surveys; Restaurants; Sodium Chloride, Dietary; Sodium, Dietary; World Health Organization",2-s2.0-84980328157

Furthermore, most of those studies have used proxy measures of body composition that may not reflect body fat distribution, particularly abdominal internal adiposity. Objective: We investigated the relation between maternal macronutrient intake and neonatal abdominal adiposity measured by using MRI in a multiethnic Asian mother-offspring cohort. Methods: The macronutrient intake of mothers was ascertained by using a 24-h dietary recall at 26-28 wk gestation. Neonatal abdominal adiposity was assessed by using MRI in week 2 of life. Mother-offspring dyads with complete macronutrient intake and adiposity information (n = 320) were included in the analysis. Associations were assessed by both substitution and addition models with the use of multivariable linear regressions. Results: Mothers (mean age: 30 y) consumed (mean ± SD) 15.5% ± 4.3% of their energy from protein, 32.4% ± 7.7% from fat, and 52.1% ± 9.0% from carbohydrate.

These associations were stronger in boys than in girls (P-interaction < 0.05). Higher maternal intake of animal protein, but not plant protein, was associated with lower offspring IAT.

Conclusions: Higher maternal protein intake at the expense of carbohydrate or fat intake at 26-28 wk gestation was associated with lower abdominal internal adiposity in neonates. Optimizing maternal dietary balance might be a new approach to improve offspring body composition. ? 2016 American Society for Nutrition.",Abdominal adiposity; Adiposity distribution; Carbohydrate; Developmental origins; Fat; Infant; Internal fat; Macronutrient; Pregnancy; Protein,"carbohydrate; fat; protein; vegetable protein; carbohydrate diet; fat intake; protein intake; abdominal circumference; abdominal fat; abdominal obesity; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; birth weight; body fat; body mass; caloric intake; cohort analysis; fat intake; female; food intake; gestation period; human; lipid diet; lipid storage; macronutrient; major clinical study; male; neonatal abdominal adiposity; newborn disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physical activity; pregnancy; protein intake; skinfold thickness; smoking; young adult; administration and dosage; adolescent; carbohydrate diet; diet; gestational age; intraabdominal fat; maternal nutrition; medical record; metabolism; newborn; obesity; Obesity, Abdominal; pharmacology; pregnancy; prospective study; recall; sex difference; Singapore; waist circumference; Adiposity; Adolescent; Adult; Birth Weight; Diet; Diet Records; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Male; Mental Recall; Obesity, Abdominal; Pregnancy; Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Prospective Studies; Sex Factors; Singapore; Skinfold Thickness; Waist Circumference; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84980316048

Bioidentical hormones are chemically identical to those produced by the human body, and several types are well-tested and available on prescription. Many women have opted for bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) on the assumption that it is safer than other forms of HT. We evaluated the evidence. Objectives: To determine the effectiveness and safety of bioidentical hormones compared to placebo or non-bioidentical hormones for the relief of vasomotor symptoms. Search methods: In July 2015 we searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PubMed, Embase, Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ci?ncias da Sa?de (LILACS), registers of ongoing trials and the reference lists of articles retrieved. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing bioidentical hormone therapy (BHT) versus placebo or non-bioidentical hormones. Data collection and analysis: We used standard methodological procedures expected by the Cochrane Collaboration. Our primary outcome was vasomotor symptoms (hot flushes and night sweats). We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria (GRADE). Main results: We included 23 RCTs (5779 participants). Most studies (20/23) included only women with moderate to severe hot flushes. All studies compared unopposed 17 beta-estradiol (beta-estradiol) versus placebo or conjugated equine estrogens (CEE). None of the studies reported night sweats as a separate outcome. BHT patch versus placebo Frequency of hot flushes Four RCTs reported data suitable for analysis. There were fewer hot flushes in the BHT group, with a moderate to large effect size (SMD -0.68, 95% CI -0.83 to -0.53, four RCTs, 793 women, I2 = 67%, low quality evidence). There was moderate heterogeneity, but a consistent direction of effect. Seven RCTs reported data unsuitable for analysis; all reported a benefit in the intervention group. Symptom intensity Two RCTs reported analysable data. Measured on a 0-100 visual analogue scale (VAS), hot flush intensity was lower in the BHT group (MD -19.94 points, 95% CI -24.86 to -15.02, two RCTs, 393 women, I2 = 54%, low quality evidence). There was moderate heterogeneity, but a consistent direction of effect. Adverse effects Adverse events (such as headache, vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness and skin reactions) were more common in the intervention group (odds ratio (OR) 2.14, 95% CI 1.29 to 3.54, 9 RCTs, 1822 women, I2 = 73%, low quality evidence). There was moderate heterogeneity, but a consistent direction of effect. In one study, five women in the intervention group developed endometrial hyperplasia. BHT gel versus placebo Hot flush frequency Three RCTs reported this outcome, but the data were unsuitable for analysis. All reported a benefit in the BHT group. Adverse effects Adverse events were more common in the BHT group (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 to 1.83, 3 RCTs, 1086 women, I2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence). Oral BHT versus placebo Hot flush frequency Two studies reported analysable data. There were fewer hot flushes in the BHT group, with a moderate to large effect size (SMD -0.80, 95% CI -1.03 to -0.57, two RCTs, 356 women, I2 = 14%, low quality evidence). Adverse effects There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 1.28, 95% CI 0.84 to 1.96, 3 RCTs, 433 women, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence). Topical BHT emulsion versus placebo Hot flush frequency One study with data unsuitable for analysis reported a benefit in the intervention group. Adverse effects There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 1.46, 95% CI 0.80 to 2.66, one RCT, 200 women, low quality evidence). Intranasal BHT versus placebo Hot flush frequency Only one study reported analysable data. There were fewer hot flushes per day in the BHT group (MD -3.04 95% CI -4.05 to -2.03, one study, 458 women, moderate quality evidence) Adverse effects Adverse events (such as headache, breast tenderness, arthralgia and nausea) were more common in the intervention group (OR 1.96, 95% CI 1.26 to 3.03, one RCT, 458 women, moderate quality evidence). Subgroup analyses Subgroup analyses by dose of BHT suggested that higher doses of BHT may be associated with more effectiveness but also higher risk of adverse effects. BHT patch versus 0.625 mg CEE Two RCTs reported this comparison, but the data were unsuitable for analysis. Hot flush frequency Both RCTs reported no evidence of a difference between the groups. Adverse effects Findings were inconsistent. In one comparison (0.1 mg BHT versus CEE), breast pain and vaginal bleeding were more frequent in the BHT group. Oral BHT versus 0.625 mg CEE Hot flush frequency One study with data unsuitable for analysis reported no evidence of a difference between the groups. Adverse effects There was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 1.20, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.87, one RCT, 103 women, very low quality evidence). Authors' conclusions: There was low to moderate quality evidence that BHT in various forms and doses is more effective than placebo for treating moderate to severe menopausal hot flushes. There was low to moderate quality evidence of higher rates of adverse effects such as headache, vaginal bleeding, breast tenderness and skin reactions in the BHT group. There was some evidence to suggest that higher doses of BHT are associated with greater effectiveness but also with higher risk of adverse effects. Although all the included studies used unopposed estrogen, it is recommended best practice to use progestogen therapy in women with a uterus taking estrogen in order to avoid endometrial hyperplasia, regardless of the source of the estrogen. No data are yet available about the safety of BHT with regard to long-term outcomes such as heart attack, stroke and breast cancer. There was no good evidence of a difference in effectiveness between BHT and CEE, and findings with regard to adverse effects were inconsistent. The quality of the evidence was too low to reach any firm conclusions. The main limitations in the quality of the evidence were study risk of bias (mainly due to poor reporting of methods), imprecision and lack of data suitable for analysis. ? 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"conjugated estrogen; estradiol; conjugated estrogen; estradiol; estrogen; breast tenderness; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; headache; hormonal therapy; hot flush; human; outcome assessment; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; skin manifestation; symptomatology; systematic review; vagina bleeding; vasomotor disorder; Hot Flashes; meta analysis; Estradiol; Estrogens; Estrogens, Conjugated (USP); Female; Hot Flashes; Humans; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",2-s2.0-84979999684

The aim of this research was to develop a technique using high resolution X-ray imaging to study pharmacologically induced aged rat models of chronic GI dysmotility that mimic accelerated transit (diarrhea) or constipation. The 5-hydroxytryptamine type 4 (5-HT4) receptor agonist prucalopride was used to accelerate transit, and the opioid agonist loperamide was used to delay transit. Methods: Male rats (18 months) were given 0, 1, 2, or 4 mg/kg/day prucalopride or loperamide (in dimethyl sulfoxide, DMSO) for 7 days by continuous 7-day dosing. To determine the GI region-specific effect, transit of six metallic beads was tracked over 12 h using high resolution X-ray imaging. An established rating scale was used to classify GI bead location in vivo and the distance beads had propagated from the caecum was confirmed postmortem. Key Results: Loperamide (1 mg/kg) slowed stomach emptying and GI transit at 9 and 12 h. Prucalopride (4 mg/kg) did not significantly alter GI transit scores, but at a dose of 4 mg/kg beads had moved significantly more distal than the caecum in 12 h compared to controls. Conclusions &amp; Inferences: We report a novel high-resolution, non-invasive, X-ray imaging technique that provides new insights into GI transit rates in live rats. The results demonstrate that loperamide slowed overall transit in aged rats, while prucalopride increased stomach emptying and accelerates colonic transit. ? 2016 The Authors.

Since the CSANZ 2011 guidelines, adjunctive clinical tests have proven useful in the diagnosis of LQTS and are discussed in this update. Understanding of the diagnostic and risk stratifying role of LQTS genetics is also discussed. At least 14 LQTS genes are now thought to be responsible for the disease. High-risk individuals may have multiple mutations, large gene rearrangements, C-loop mutations in KCNQ1, transmembrane mutations in KCNH2, or have certain gene modifiers present, particularly NOS1AP polymorphisms. In regards to treatment, nadolol is preferred, particularly for long QT type 2, and short acting metoprolol should not be used. Thoracoscopic left cardiac sympathectomy is valuable in those who cannot adhere to beta blocker therapy, particularly in long QT type 1. Indications for ICD therapies have been refined; and a primary indication for ICD in post-pubertal females with long QT type 2 and a very long QT interval is emerging. ? 2016",Diagnosis; Genetics; Long QT syndrome; Management; Sudden death,"nadolol; potassium channel KCNQ1; sodium channel Nav1.5; KCNH2 protein, human; KCNQ1 protein, human; NOS1AP protein, human; potassium channel HERG; signal transducing adaptor protein; cardiovascular risk; clinical feature; electrocardiography; family history; gene; gene rearrangement; genetic counseling; genetic screening; heart denervation; high risk population; human; implantable cardioverter defibrillator; KCNH2 gene; KCNQ1 gene; left cardiac sympathetic denervation; Letter; lifestyle modification; long QT syndrome; molecular genetics; mutational analysis; NOS1AP gene; patient counseling; priority journal; residue analysis; risk assessment; SCN5A gene; screening test; sudden cardiac death; sympathectomy; treatment indication; female; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; genetic polymorphism; genetics; long QT syndrome; male; mutation; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; ERG1 Potassium Channel; Female; Genetic Diseases, Inborn; Humans; KCNQ1 Potassium Channel; Long QT Syndrome; Male; Mutation; Polymorphism, Genetic",2-s2.0-84973880496

Examining structural differences in individuals with high levels of schizotypy may help elucidate the course of disorder progression, and provide further support for the schizotypy-schizophrenia continuum. Thus far, the few studies investigating grey matter differences in schizotypy have produced inconsistent results. In the current study, we used a multivariate partial least squares (PLS) approach to clarify the relationship between psychometric schizotypy (measured by the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences) and grey matter volume in 49 healthy adults. We found a negative association between all schizotypy dimensions and grey matter volume in the frontal and temporal lobes, as well as the insula. We also found a positive association between all schizotypy dimensions and grey matter volume in the parietal and temporal lobes, and in subcortical regions. Further correlational analyses revealed that positive and disorganised schizotypy were strongly associated with key regions (left superior temporal gyrus and insula) most consistently reported to be affected in schizophrenia and schizotypy. We also compared PLS with the typically used General Linear Model (GLM) and demonstrate that PLS can be reliably used as an extension to voxel-based morphometry (VBM) data. This may be particularly valuable for schizotypy research due to PLS' ability to detect small, but reliable effects.Together, the findings indicate that healthy schizotypal individuals exhibit structural changes in regions associated with schizophrenia. This adds to the evidence of an overlap of phenotypic expression between schizotypy and schizophrenia, and may help establish biological endophenotypes for the disorder. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Gray matter volume; Neuroanatomy; Schizophrenia; Schizotypy; Structural PLS,"adult; Article; brain size; female; frontal lobe; general linear model; gray matter; human; human experiment; insula; male; normal human; parietal lobe; partial least squares regression; psychological theory; psychometry; schizophrenia; schizotypy; statistical model; subcortex; superior temporal gyrus; temporal lobe; voxel based morphometry; brain cortex; brain mapping; gray matter; image processing; least square analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; schizotypal personality disorder; Adult; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Least-Squares Analysis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Schizophrenia; Schizotypal Personality Disorder",2-s2.0-84968918901

Methods National hospitalisation and mortality data were anonymously linked to determine receipt of angiography and revascularisation for 30-84 year-olds hospitalised with ACS between 2007 and 2012. Multilevel Cox regression, accounting for individual factors and admitting hospital, was used to estimate adjusted procedural rates within 30 days of admission. Results Of the 50,324 ACS patients included, 10% were M?ori, 4% Pacific, 3% Indian and 83% New Zealand European or Other ethnicities (NZEO). A larger proportion of M?ori (48%) than NZEO (36%), Pacific (19%) and Indian (14%) patients were admitted to hospitals without catheterisation facilities. More M?ori and Pacific (22-24%) than NZEO and Indian patients (12-13%) had severe comorbidities. M?ori and Pacific were less likely than NZEO patients to receive angiography (adjusted HRs 0.94 [0.91-0.98] and 0.93 [0.87-0.98] respectively) and revascularisation (adjusted HRs 0.79 [0.75-0.83] and 0.77 [0.71-0.83]), even after adjusting for important demographic and clinical factors. Conclusions A higher comorbidity burden in M?ori and Pacific patients and reduced access to catheterisation facilities for non-urban M?ori contributed to lower procedure rates after ACS admission. Ethnic differences remained after adjustment for these factors and require further investigation. ? 2016 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)",Acute coronary syndromes; Coronary revascularisation; Myocardial infarction,"acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; Article; catheterization; comorbidity; coronary angiography; disease severity; ethnic difference; female; health care access; heart muscle revascularization; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; priority journal; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; unstable angina pectoris; acute coronary syndrome; clinical trial; epidemiology; ethnology; factual database; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; Myocardial Infarction; percutaneous coronary intervention; very elderly; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; New Zealand; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention",2-s2.0-84964329481

Methods and results: Baseline data on ORA and serum 25(OH)D, collected from 11,746 participants aged 30-90 years in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey during 1988-1994, were linked to the National Death Index for assessment of CVD deaths from baseline through December 2006. CVD mortality as a primary cause of death was assessed during a mean follow up of 12.9 (SD, 4.2) years.There were 1519 CVD deaths during follow up. A strong positive association was observed between frequency of ORA in the last month and serum 25(OH)D (p < 0.001). Compared to participants who did no ORA in the last month, the hazard ratio (HR) of CVD mortality was 0.72 (95% confidence interval 0.58-0.90) for those doing ORA 1-4 times, 0.64 (0.47-0.89) for 5-12 times, 0.70 (0.56-0.89) for 13-30 times and 0.63 (0.47-0.84) for ?30 times (p-trend < 0.001), in a Cox proportional hazards regression model which included 25(OH)D and CVD risk factors. Serum 25(OH)D was inversely associated with CVD mortality (p-trend, 0.01) in this same model. Conclusions: An inverse association between ORA and CVD mortality was observed independent of 25(OH)D. The underlying mechanism for this association may not involve 25(OH)D hence, further studies are warranted to confirm and investigate the underlying mechanism. ? 2016 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University.",CVD; Outdoor recreational activity; Physical activity; Vitamin D,25 hydroxyvitamin D; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; biological marker; vitamin D; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular mortality; cross-sectional study; disease association; female; health survey; human; male; NHANES III; priority journal; radioimmunoassay; recreational game; analogs and derivatives; blood; Cardiovascular Diseases; cause of death; epidemiology; exercise; middle aged; mortality; nutrition; recreation; risk assessment; risk factor; season; time factor; United States; vitamin D deficiency; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Recreation; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Seasons; Time Factors; United States; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency,2-s2.0-84963674167

Design: Cross-sectional. Methods: Data from two-year waves (2003-2004 and 2005-2006) of the National Health and Nutritional Examination survey were analysed in 2014. Accelerometer-derived time and proportion of time spent sedentary and on moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were calculated to generate four activity profiles based on cut-points to define low and high levels for the respective behaviours. Using health outcome data, CVDR was calculated for each person. Weighted multiple linear regression models were used to evaluate the predicted effects of sedentary and physical activity behaviours on the CVDR score, adjusting for participants' sex, age group, race, annual household income, and accelerometer wear time. Results: The lowest CVDR was observed among Busy Exercisers (high MVPA and low sedentary; 8.5%), whereas Couch Potatoes (low MVPA and high sedentary) had the highest (18.6%). Compared with the reference group (Busy Exercisers), the activity profile associated with the highest CVDR was Couch Potatoes (adjusted mean difference 3.6, SE 0.38, p < 0.0001). A smoothed three-dimensional response surface ""risk landscape"" was developed to better visualise the conjoint associations of MVPA and sedentary behaviour on CVDR for each activity profile. The association between MVPA was greater than that of sedentary behaviour; however, for people with low MVPA, shifts in sedentary behaviour may have the greatest impact on CVDR. Conclusions: Activity profiles that consider the interrelationships between physical activity and sedentary behaviour differ in terms of CVDR. Future interventions may need to be tailored to specific profiles and be dynamic enough to reflect change in the profile over time. ? 2015 Sports Medicine Australia.",Accelerometer; Cardiovascular diseases; Motor activity; Physical activity; Sedentary lifestyle; Sitting,"glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; accelerometry; adult; aged; Article; cardiorespiratory fitness; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; clinical examination; cross-sectional study; female; Framingham risk score; glucose blood level; health status; health survey; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; physical activity; practice guideline; prediction; sedentary lifestyle; smoking; Cardiovascular Diseases; exercise; middle aged; nutrition; procedures; risk; sedentary lifestyle; statistical model; time factor; very elderly; Accelerometry; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Nutrition Surveys; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Risk; Sedentary Lifestyle; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84940092730

Menopause status is a well-known risk factor for endometrial cancer and most cases occur after menopause. It is, however, less clear how the menopause status is associated with endometrial cancer including its subtypes in Chinese women. Methods: Data on 1,746 women with endometrial cancer including age at diagnosis, age at menopause, and tumor histology from two large obstetrical and gynecological hospitals in China were analyzed. Results: The median age of women at diagnosis was 50 years. Fifty-eight percent of women were diagnosed after menopause. Fifty-six percent of women with type 1 and 69% with type 2 were diagnosed after menopause. In addition, in both pre- and postmenopausal women, there was no difference in the age at diagnosis between type 1 (46 vs 46 y) and type 2 endometrial cancer (53 vs 52 y). Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that although both type 1 and type 2 endometrial cancers are more likely to occur in Chinese women after menopause than before, the total prevalence of endometrial cancer is lower in our study population than in previous reports from white women (80%).

The number of patients with end-stage renal disease being relisted for a second kidney transplant is increasing worldwide. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between waiting time for a second transplant and outcomes after that second transplant. Methods. Using Australia and New Zealand Dialysis and Transplant registry, patients who have received second kidney transplants between 1997 and 2009 were included. The associations between waiting time, defined as duration of dialysis between first allograft failure and second transplantation, and clinical outcomes including acute rejection, graft and patient survival were examined using adjusted logistic and Cox regression models. Results. Of the 911 recipients, the median follow-up time was 4.7 years resulting in 4825 person-years of follow-up. Increasing waiting time before second transplants was associated with an increased risk of early acute rejection occurring within the first 6 months after transplant (adjusted odds ratio, 1.11; 95%confidence interval [95%CI], 1.06-1.16; P < 0.001), severe vascular and/or humoral rejection (adjusted odds ratio, 1.06; 95%CI, 1.01-1.11; P = 0.011), overall graft failure (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.06; 95% CI, 1.02-1.10; P = 0.001), all-cause mortality (adjusted HR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.07-1.19; P < 0.001), and death with a functioning graft (adjusted HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.18; P < 0.001), independent of donor, recipient, and immunological factors. Conclusions. Prolonged waiting time for a second transplant was associated with inferior patient and graft outcomes. Copyright ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The World Health Organisation's recognition of palliative care as a basic human right has seen many countries worldwide develop national policy in palliative and end of life care. There is increasing debate about what form comprehensive palliative care services should take, particularly in relation to the balance between acute and community based services. It is therefore timely to review how national policy positions the current and future role of the acute hospital in palliative care provision. The aim of this exploratory review is to identify the role envisaged for the acute hospital in palliative and end of life care provision in five countries with an 'advanced' level of integration. Method: Countries were identified using the Global Atlas of Palliative Care. Policies were accessed through internet searching of government websites between October and December 2014. Using a process of thematic analysis key themes related to palliative care in hospital were identified. Results: Policies from Switzerland, England, Singapore, Australia and Ireland were analysed for recurring themes. Three themes were identified: preferences for place of care and place of death outside the hospital setting, unnecessary or avoidable hospital admissions, and quality of care in hospital. No policy focused upon exploring how palliative care could be improved in the hospital setting or indeed what role the hospital may have in the provision of palliative care. Conclusions: Palliative care policy in five countries with 'advanced' levels of palliative care integration focuses on solving the 'problems' associated with hospital as a place of palliative care and death. No positive role for hospitals in palliative care provision is envisaged. Given the rapidly increasing population of people requiring palliative care, and emerging evidence that patients themselves report benefits of hospital admissions, this area requires further investigation. In particular, a co-design approach to policy development is needed to ensure that services match the needs and wants of patients and families. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Hospital; Palliative care; Policy,"Australia; death; England; family study; government; hospital admission; human; Internet; palliative therapy; Singapore; Switzerland; terminal care; thematic analysis; clinical trial; health care policy; health care quality; hospitalization; integrated health care system; Ireland; multicenter study; organization and management; organizational policy; palliative therapy; patient preference; standards; statistics and numerical data; unnecessary procedure; Australia; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; England; Health Policy; Hospitalization; Humans; Ireland; Organizational Policy; Palliative Care; Patient Preference; Quality of Health Care; Singapore; Switzerland; Unnecessary Procedures",2-s2.0-84979608013

Methods During 2011 (Phase 1) and again in 2014 (Phase 2) MEF and NP samples from 325 children and 319 children were taken at the time of VT insertion. A matched comparison group had NP swabs collected with 137 children (Phase 1) and 154 (Phase 2). Culture was performed on all NP and MEF samples with further molecular identification of Haemophilus species, serotyping of S. pneumoniae, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on all MEF samples. Results In Phase 2 immunisation coverage with ?3 doses of PHiD-CV10 was 93%. The rate and ratios of culture and molecular detection of the 3 main otopathogens was unchanged between Phase 1 and Phase 2 in both MEF and NP. Haemophilus influenzae was cultured in one quarter and detected by PCR in 53% of MEF samples in both time periods. S. pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis were cultured in up to 13% and detected by PCR in 27% and 40% respectively of MEF samples. H. influenzae was the most common organism isolated from NP samples (61%) in the children undergoing VT surgery whilst M. catarrhalis (49%) was the most common in the non-otitis prone group. 19A was the most prominent S. pneumoniae serotype in both MEF and NP samples in Phase 2. Of Haemophilus isolates, 95% were confirmed to be non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi) over both time periods. Conclusion Following implementation of PHiD-CV10 in New Zealand, there has been no significant change in the 3 major otopathogens in NP or MEF in children with established ear disease. For these children non-typeable H. influenzae remains the dominant otopathogen detected. ? 2016 The Authors",Child; Nasopharyngeal carriage; Otitis media; Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine,"amoxicillin; antibiotic agent; Pneumococcus vaccine; 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; acute otitis media; antibiotic sensitivity; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacterium carrier; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; bodily secretions; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; family history; female; Haemophilus influenzae; human; major clinical study; male; middle ear; minimum inhibitory concentration; Moraxella catarrhalis; New Zealand; otitis media; penicillin resistance; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; recurrent infection; secretory otitis media; serotyping; Streptococcus pneumoniae; tympanostomy tube; vaccination; infant; isolation and purification; microbiology; Otitis Media with Effusion; preschool child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Ear, Middle; Female; Haemophilus influenzae; Heptavalent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine; Humans; Infant; Male; Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis; New Zealand; Otitis Media with Effusion; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Streptococcus pneumoniae",2-s2.0-84990964636

Peer-led programs have not been formally assessed in a medical student population, where psychological issues exist and where it has been shown that students approach peers for help in preference to staff members or professional services. Intervention: Medical students elected peer leaders who underwent training and then provided the intervention. The peer leaders provided support to students in the intervention group, as well as offering teaching in mindfulness meditation. Context: An exploratory study was conducted with 2nd- and 3rd-year medical students at 1 medical school in New Zealand randomized into 2 groups. In addition to existing mental health resources, intervention participants received a program including peer support and peer-taught mindfulness practice. Study participants not offered the intervention participants could use existing mental health resources. Primary measures included depression (PHQ-9) and anxiety (GAD-7) scores. Secondary measures were quality of life, resilience (15-item resilience scale), academic self-concept, and motivation to learn, assessed at baseline and 6 months. Outcome: Of the 402 students eligible, 275 (68%) participated and 232 (58%) completed the study. At baseline, 53% were female and mean age was 21?years (SD = 3)—PHQ-9 score (M = 5.2, SD = 3.7) and GAD-7 score (M = 4.5, SD = 3.4). Twelve peer leaders were elected. There was good participation in the intervention. One fourth of intervention students used the face-to-face peer support and more than 50% attended a peer social event and/or participated in the mindfulness program. Although improvements in mental health were seen in the intervention group, the difference between the intervention and nonintervention groups did not reach statistical significance. Lessons Learned: Although evidence exists for effectiveness of peer support and mindfulness in other contexts, this exploratory study was not able to show a statistically significant effect. Future studies could consider using a longer training period for the peer leaders, as well as targeting the study population to those most likely to benefit such as those with poorer mental health, or using a more intensive intervention or larger sample size.

However, these repeated injections have been associated with pain, risk of infection, hemorrhages, retinal detachment and high treatment costs. To overcome these limitations, light-responsive in situ forming injectable implants (ISFIs) may emerge as novel systems providing site-specific controlled drug delivery to the retinal tissues with great accuracy, safety, minimal invasiveness and high cost efficiency. Area covered: Complex ocular barriers, routes for drug delivery, types of injectable implants, ocular application of light and benefits of light-responsive systems are discussed with regards to challenges and strategies employed for effective drug delivery to the posterior segment of the eye. In particular, we have highlighted photoresponsive moieties, photopolymerization mechanisms and different development strategies with their limitations as well as recent advancements in the field. Expert opinion: Biodegradable light-responsive ISFIs are promising drug delivery systems that have shown a high degree of biocompatibility with sustained drug release in a number of applications. However, their use in intravitreal drug delivery is still in the very early stages. Issues related to the biocompatibility of the photoinitiator and the elimination of photo-degraded by-products from the ocular tissues need careful consideration, not only from a chemistry standpoint, but also from a biological perspective to improve the suitability of these systems for clinical applications. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Injectable implants; light-responsive systems; ocular drug delivery; photocleavage; photodimerization; photoisomerization,azobenzene; bevacizumab; nintedanib; photoinitiator; polymer; timolol maleate; delayed release formulation; drug implant; biocompatibility; drug delivery system; elasticity; eye disease; human; injectable implant; intraocular drug administration; light responsive in situ forming injectable implant; nonhuman; particle size; photoreactivity; retinal tissue; Review; sustained drug release; viscosity; administration and dosage; delayed release formulation; drug implant; eye; Eye Diseases; intravitreal drug administration; metabolism; Delayed-Action Preparations; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Implants; Eye; Eye Diseases; Humans; Intravitreal Injections,2-s2.0-84961392627

Setting Auckland District Health Board, Auckland, New Zealand. Design Prospective randomized controlled study. Methods Both eyes of all patients were examined preoperatively and 1, 3, 6, and 12?months postoperatively. One eye of each patient was treated with corneal CXL, with the contralateral eye serving as the control. Examinations included uncorrected distance visual acuity and corrected distance visual?acuity (CDVA), slitlamp biomicroscopy, and Scheimpflug tomography (Pentacam). Results Thirty-six eyes of 36 patients were enrolled. The mean preoperative corneal densitometry was 19.0?±?3.2 (SD). Postoperatively, the mean densitometry peaked at 1?month, decreasing to baseline level after 6?months without application of topical corticosteroids. The development of haze was significant compared with the contralateral untreated eyes (P?<?.01). The anterior (120?μm) and inner (central 0.0 to 2.0?mm) zones of the cornea had the highest densitometry after treatment. Lower preoperative central corneal thickness (CCT) was significantly correlated with higher corneal densitometry (P?=?.03). However, the preoperative CCT, keratometry, and astigmatism did not influence the difference in densitometry between the treated eyes and untreated eyes. There was no evidence of a relationship between densitometry and CDVA (P?=?.30). Conclusions After corneal CXL, patients with keratoconus developed transient corneal haze in the anterior central cornea that might not require specific treatment. Thin corneas were associated with higher densitometry; thus, there might be a greater expectancy of corneal haze in patients with advanced keratoconus.

Bariatric surgery is the only effective therapy for achieving remission of T2D among those with morbid obesity. It is unclear which of the two most commonly performed types of bariatric surgery, laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) and laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB), is most effective for obese patients with T2D. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether LSG or LRYGB is more effective in achieving HbA1c<6% (<42 mmol/mol) without the use of diabetes medication at 5 years. Methods and analysis: Single-centre, double-blind (assessor and patient), parallel, randomised clinical trial (RCT) conducted in New Zealand, targeting 106 patients. Eligibility criteria include age 20-55 years, T2D of at least 6 months duration and body mass index 35-65 kg/m2 for at least 5 years. Randomisation 1:1 to LSG or LRYGB, used random number codes disclosed to the operating surgeon after induction of anaesthesia. A standard medication adjustment schedule will be used during postoperative metabolic assessments. Secondary outcomes include proportions achieving HbA1c<5.7% (39 mmol/mol) or HbA1c<6.5% (48 mmol/mol) without the use of diabetes medication, comparative weight loss, obesity-related comorbidity, operative complications, revision rate, mortality, quality of life, anxiety and depression scores. Exploratory outcomes include changes in satiety, gut hormone and gut microbiota to gain underlying mechanistic insights into T2D remission. Ethics and dissemination: Ethics approval was obtained from the New Zealand regional ethics committee (NZ93405) who also provided independent safety monitoring of the trial.

Women with SLE are at increased risk of cardiovascular events (CVEs), but a relationship with traditional cardiovascular and SLE-specific risk factors has not been established. In unselected populations, adverse pregnancy outcomes linked to maternal-placental syndrome (MPS) are associated with an increased risk of CVEs. However, the effect of MPS on CVEs is unknown in women with SLE. The aim of this study was to determine if MPS increased the risk and accelerated the development of CVEs in women with SLE. Methods. Utilizing Swedish population registries, parous women with SLE were identified. Exposures were the following: MPS defined as hypertensive disorders of pregnancy; small-for-gestational-age; placental abruption and stillbirth; and preterm delivery<34 weeks. Outcomes were CVE encompassing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Risk of an event was modelled using Cox proportional hazards adjusted for year of delivery, age at CVE, severity of SLE and cardiovascular risk factors. Time-to-CVE was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methods. Results. Over the 38-year study period, there were 3977 women with 7410 pregnancies, of whom 413 (10.2%) suffered a CVE. Hazard of CVE was higher in those with MPS, particularly when MPS (adjusted HR= 1.64; 95% CI: 1.31, 2.05) was combined with preterm delivery<34 weeks' gestation (adjusted HR 1.99; 95% CI 1.39, 2.84). There was accelerated development of CVEs in women with MPS of 10.5% (vs 7.3% in uncomplicated pregnancies) over the 38-year interval (P<0.05). Conclusion. Pregnancy complicated by MPS and preterm delivery exerts an independent effect to increase the risk and accelerate the development of CVEs in parous women with SLE. ?

The extent of necrosis is associated with poor survival, most likely because it reflects aggressive tumour outgrowth and inflammation. Intravenously injected spores of anaerobic bacteria from the genus Clostridium infiltrate and selectively germinate in these necrotic regions, providing cancer-specific colonisation. The specificity of this system was first demonstrated over 60 years ago and evidence of colonisation has been confirmed in multiple tumour models. The use of “armed” clostridia, such as in Clostridium Directed Enzyme Prodrug Therapy (CDEPT), may help to overcome some of the described deficiencies of using wild-type clostridia for treatment of cancer, such as tumour regrowth from a well-vascularised outer rim of viable cells. Successful preclinical evaluation of a transferable gene that metabolises both clinical stage positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents (for whole body vector visualisation) as well as chemotherapy prodrugs (for conditional enhancement of efficacy) would be a valuable early step towards the prospect of “armed” clostridia entering clinical evaluation. The ability to target the immunosuppressive hypoxic tumour microenvironment using CDEPT may offer potential for synergy with recently developed immunotherapy strategies. Ultimately, clostridia may be most efficacious when combined with conventional therapies, such as radiotherapy, that sterilise viable aerobic tumour cells. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Cancer; Clostridium; Gene therapy; Imaging; Immunotherapy; Prodrug; Radiotherapy,bacterial vector; oncolytic virus; tumor marker; antineoplastic activity; bacterial colonization; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; cancer chemotherapy; cancer gene therapy; cancer immunotherapy; cancer staging; Clostridium; Clostridium directed enzyme prodrug therapy; Clostridium novyi; Clostridium sporogenes; enzyme prodrug therapy; gene directed enzyme prodrug therapy; human; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; Review; tumor cell destruction; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumor necrosis; viral gene delivery system; wild type,2-s2.0-84976578475

In addition, 31?% of women used one or more strategies to maintain their motivation to adhere and the use of cognitive self-talk (e.g., thoughts regarding endocrine therapy efficacy) was related to higher adherence. Hierarchical linear regressions revealed a significant behavioral barrier?×?behavioral facilitator interaction (P?&lt;?0.05); participants who endorsed a behavioral barrier in the absence of a behavioral facilitator reported the lowest adherence.

Recent data indicate that osteoporotic fractures are more common than other diseases, which usually attract public attention (e.g., heart attack and breast cancer). The prevention and treatment of this skeletal disorder are therefore of paramount importance. Majority of osteoporosis medications restore skeletal balance by reducing osteoclastic activity, thereby reducing bone resorption. These agents, however, do not regenerate damaged bone tissue, leaving limited options for patients once bone loss has occurred. Recently, attention has turned to bone-anabolic agents. Such agents have the ability to increase bone mass and strength, potentially reversing structural damage. To date, only one bone-anabolic drug is available in the market. The discovery of more novel, cost-effective bone anabolic agents is therefore a priority to treat those suffering from this disabling condition. Short peptides offer an important alternative for the development of novel bone-anabolic agents given their high target binding specificity, which translates into potent activity with limited side effects.

Food-based materials have great potential as efficient anti-diabetic agents.

Various types of fruits, vegetables, legumes, cereals, spices, beverages, oilseeds, and edible oils showed antidiabetic effects in different animal models. Animal feeding trials rarely had identical designs in food doses, feeding schedules, and routes of administration, as well as biochemical markers for antidiabetic evaluation. A range of possible cellular and metabolic targets were speculated for the anti-hyperglycemic effects of the dietary materials, and the molecular mechanisms of action remain to be better explored. Short-term (maximum 16 weeks) antidiabetic studies have been established. Limited safety/tolerability data are available for antidiabetic dietary materials.

It has been 10 years since China implemented its new web-based infection surveillance system, which covers the largest population in the world. Methods: In this study, time series data were collected for 28 infectious diseases reported from 2005 to 2014 Seasonality and long-term trends were explored using decomposition methods. Seasonality was expressed by calculating the seasonal indices. Long-term trends in the diseases were assessed using a linear regression model on the deseasonalized series. Results: During the 10-year period, 38 982 567 cases and 126 372 deaths were reported in the system. The proportion of deaths caused by AIDS increased from 12% in 2005 to 78% in 2014. There were six diseases for which the seasonal index range was greater than 2: dengue fever, Japanese encephalitis, leptospirosis, anthrax, cerebrospinal meningitis, and measles Among the 28 diseases, the incidence of syphilis increased fastest, with an average increase of 0.018626/100 000 every month after adjustment for seasonality. Conclusions: Effective surveillance is helpful in gaining a better understanding of the infection behaviour of infectious diseases; this will greatly facilitate disease control and management. ? 2016 The Authors.

Accordingly, the aims of this study were to assess the prevalence, persistence and molecular epidemiology of S. aureus colonization in the nares and oropharynx of M?ori and Pacific children, a population with strikingly high rates of S. aureus infection. Methods: A cross-sectional study of predominantly M?ori and Pacific school-aged children in Auckland, New Zealand was performed in October 2013, and swabs were taken from the nares and oropharynx. Sampling was repeated from the same schools in October 2014. All S. aureus isolates underwent antimicrobial susceptibility testing and spa typing. Results: Overall, 506/893 (56.7%) children were colonized with S. aureus, and the colonization prevalence was significantly higher in the oropharynx than nares (41.1% vs. 31.5%; P < 0.001). Longitudinal colonization was significantly higher in the oropharynx than the nares, and children with longitudinal oropharyngeal colonization were more likely to be colonized with the same spa type than those colonized in the nares (67.6% vs. 37.0%; P = 0.01). Approximately 40% of children had discordant spa types at the nares and oropharynx. Conclusions: Oropharyngeal S. aureus colonization represents a significant reservoir of S. aureus and it is possible that the oropharynx may represent a protected anatomical niche, enabling persistent colonization with the same S. aureus strain.

Our understanding of the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of GCA has advanced rapidly in recent times. The validity of using the American College of Rheumatology guidelines for diagnosis of GCA in a clinical setting has been robustly challenged. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate, an important marker of inflammation, is lowered by the use of statins and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Conversely, it may be falsely elevated with a low hematocrit. Despite the emergence of new diagnostic modalities, temporal artery biopsy remains the gold standard. Evidence suggests that shorter biopsy lengths and biopsies done weeks to months after initiation of steroid therapy are still useful. New imaging techniques such as positron emission tomography have shown that vascular inflammation in GCA is more widespread than originally thought. GCA, Takayasu arteritis, and polymyalgia rheumatica are no longer thought to exist as distinct entities and are more likely parts of a spectrum of disease. A range of immunosuppressive drugs have been used in conjunction with corticosteroids to treat GCA.

In this study, we hypothesized that the extent of such drug effects on impulse control is related to specific dopamine gene polymorphisms. This double-blind, placebo-controlled study aimed to examine the effect of single doses of 0.5 and 1.0 mg of the dopamine agonist ropinirole on impulse control in healthy adults of typical age for PD onset. Impulse control was measured by stop signal RT on a response inhibition task and by an index of impulsive decision-making on the Balloon Analogue Risk Task. A dopamine genetic risk score quantified basal dopamine neurotransmission from the influence of five genes: catechol-O-methyltransferase, dopamine transporter, and those encoding receptors D1, D2, and D3. With placebo, impulse control was better for the high versus low genetic risk score groups. Ropinirole modulated impulse control in a manner dependent on genetic risk score. For the lower score group, both doses improved response inhibition (decreased stop signal RT) whereas the lower dose reduced impulsiveness in decisionmaking. Conversely, the higher score group showed a trend for worsened response inhibition on the lower dose whereas both doses increased impulsiveness in decision-making. The implications of the present findings are that genotyping can be used to predict impulse control and whether it will improve or worsen with the administration of dopamine agonists. ? 2016 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.",,"Amines; Decision making; Disease control; Genes; Neurophysiology; Risk assessment; Catechol-O-methyltransferase; Dopamine transporters; Drug effects; Gene polymorphism; Genetic risks; Impulse control; Parkinson disease; Typical ages; Controlled drug delivery; catechol methyltransferase; domperidone; dopamine; dopamine 1 receptor; dopamine 2 receptor; dopamine 3 receptor; dopamine transporter; ropinirole; catechol methyltransferase; COMT protein, human; dopamine 1 receptor; dopamine 2 receptor; dopamine 3 receptor; dopamine receptor stimulating agent; dopamine transporter; DRD1 protein, human; DRD2 protein, human; DRD3 protein, human; indole derivative; ropinirole; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; decision making; dizziness; DNA polymorphism; dose response; double blind procedure; female; gene; genetic risk; genotype; headache; human; human experiment; impulse control disorder; impulsiveness; male; nausea; neurotransmission; Parkinson disease; patient compliance; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; reinforcement; single drug dose; task performance; vomiting; working memory; xerostomia; drug effects; genetic predisposition; genetics; impulsiveness; middle aged; motor activity; reaction time; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; Aged; Catechol O-Methyltransferase; Decision Making; Dopamine Agonists; Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Indoles; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Activity; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reaction Time; Receptors, Dopamine D1; Receptors, Dopamine D2; Receptors, Dopamine D3",2-s2.0-84959869119

Background: Inguinal hernia repair is a common operative procedure. The development of postoperative pain is uncommon, but at times debilitating. The role of inguinal neurectomy is currently unknown, with no single large study available, and previous reviews included only a few heterogeneous studies. Methods: Relevant randomized trials were identified from searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, and EBM Review databases until October 2014. Meta-analysis was performed based on Cochrane Methods using RevMan v5.3 software. Pain, pain scores, sensory changes, and complications over short (half to <3 months), mid (3 to <12 mo), and long term (?12 mo) were recorded. Results: All included studies performed Lichtenstein hernia repair. Eleven studies on 1031 patients showed significant reduction in pain with neurectomy for short (RR = 0.61, 0.40-0.93) and midterm (RR = 0.30, 0.20-0.46), but not for long term (RR = 0.50, 0.25-1.01). Three studies (270 patients) showed significantly reduced short-term pain (RR = 0.69, 0.52-0.90). No studies included genitofemoral neurectomy. Rates of hematoma, infection, urinary retention, and recurrence were not different between groups. Conclusions: Routine ilioinguinal neurectomy during Lichtenstein-type herniorrhaphy seems to be a safe and effective method to reduce pain in the short and midterm, but may have little long-term impact. Iliohypogastric neurectomy seems to reduce pain in at least the short term. ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",chronic pain; genitofemoral; iliohypogastric; ilioinguinal; neurectomy; pain,"Article; conservative treatment; follow up; hematoma; hernioplasty; human; inguinal hernia; meta analysis; neurectomy; postoperative complication; postoperative pain; priority journal; prophylactic surgical procedure; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; risk reduction; systematic review; urine retention; visual analog scale; wound infection; Hernia, Inguinal; herniorrhaphy; inguinal canal; innervation; neurosurgery; Pain, Postoperative; procedures; quality of life; surgical mesh; treatment outcome; Hernia, Inguinal; Herniorrhaphy; Humans; Inguinal Canal; Neurosurgical Procedures; Pain, Postoperative; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Surgical Mesh; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84954349531

Methods The contributions of age, sex, ancestry, Q141K genotype for ABCG2, FCU, sugar-sweetened beverage and alcohol consumption, metabolic syndrome disorders and measures of renal function to the risk of hyperuricaemia were evaluated by comparing hyperuricaemic (serum urate?0.42 mmol/L, n=448) with normouricaemic (serum urate<0.42 mmol/L, n=344) participants using stepwise logistic regression. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC). Results ABCG2 genotype, FCU, male sex, body mass index, serum triglyceride concentrations, estimated glomerular filtration rate and consumption of alcohol were the best predictors of hyperuricaemia (AUROC 0.90, 81% accuracy). Homozygosity in the 141K variant for ABCG2 conferred an adjusted OR of 10.5 for hyperuricaemia (95% CI 2.4 to 46.2). For each 1% decrease of FCU, the adjusted OR increased by 51% (OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.37 to 1.66). There was no association between ABCG2 genotype and FCU (r=0.02, p=0.83). Conclusions The ABCG2 141K variant and the FCU contribute strongly but independently to hyperuricaemia.

We evaluated 14 unrelated probands who had a clinical diagnosis of PPCD who were previously determined to be negative for mutations in ZEB1 by direct sequencing. A combination of techniques was used including whole-exome sequencing (WES), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array copy number variation (CNV) analysis, quantitative real-time PCR, and long-range PCR. Segregation of potentially pathogenic changes with disease was confirmed, where possible, in family members. A putative run of homozygosity on chromosome 10 was identified by WES in a three-generation PPCD family, suggestive of a heterozygous deletion. SNP array genotyping followed by long-range PCR and direct sequencing to define the breakpoints confirmed the presence of a large deletion that encompassed multiple genes, including ZEB1. Identification of a heterozygous deletion spanning ZEB1 prompted us to further investigate potential CNVs at this locus in the remaining probands, leading to detection of two additional heterozygous ZEB1 gene deletions. This study demonstrates that ZEB1 mutations account for a larger proportion of PPCD than previously estimated, and supports the hypothesis that haploinsufficiency of ZEB1 is the underlying molecular mechanism of disease for PPCD3. ? 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Based on the Growing Up in Singapore towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) mother-offspring cohort, cross-sectional dietary patterns were derived by factor analysis using 24-h recalls and food diaries of infants at 6-, 9- and 12-months of age. Dietary pattern trajectories were modeled by mapping similar dietary patterns across each age using multilevel mixed models. Associations with maternal socio-demographic variables, collected through questionnaires during pregnancy, were assessed using general linear models. In n = 486 infants, four dietary pattern trajectories were established from 6- to 12-months. Predominantly breastmilk: mainly breastmilk and less formula milk, Guidelines: rice porridge, vegetables, fruits and low-fat fish and meat, Easy-to-prepare foods: infant cereals, juices, cakes and biscuits and Noodles (in soup) and seafood: noodle and common accompaniments. In adjusted models, higher maternal education attainment was correlated with higher start scores on Predominantly breastmilk, but lowest education attainment increased its adherence over time. Older mothers had higher start scores on Easy-to-prepare foods, but younger mothers had increased adherence over time. Chinese mothers had higher start scores on Predominantly breastmilk but greater adherence to Guidelines over time, while Indian mothers had higher start scores on Easy-to-prepare foods but greater adherence to Predominantly breastmilk with time (p < 0.05 for all). Changes in trajectories over time were small. Hence, dietary patterns established during weaning are strongly influenced by maternal socio-demographic factors and remain stable over the first year of life. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Asian; Dietary pattern trajectories; Factor analysis; First year of life; Infant dietary patterns; Multilevel mixed models,"artificial milk; biscuit; cereal; Chinese; diet; education; factorial analysis; female; fruit; human; Indian; infant; major clinical study; mental capacity; mother; population model; practice guideline; pregnancy; questionnaire; sea food; statistical model; vegetable; weaning; Asian continental ancestry group; breast milk; China; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; ethnic group; infant nutrition; medical record; nutritional assessment; Singapore; socioeconomics; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; China; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Diet Records; Ethnic Groups; Fruit; Humans; Infant; Infant Formula; Infant Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Linear Models; Milk, Human; Nutrition Assessment; Singapore; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vegetables; Weaning",2-s2.0-84975080912

Multiple functions of cohesin, including cell division and gene expression, highlight its potential as a novel therapeutic target. The SMC3 subunit of cohesin is acetylated (ac) during S phase to establish cohesion between replicated chromosomes. Following anaphase, ac-SMC3 is deacetylated by HDAC8. Reversal of SMC3 acetylation is imperative for recycling cohesin so that it can be reloaded in interphase for both non-mitotic and mitotic functions. We blocked deacetylation of ac-SMC3 using an HDAC8-specific inhibitor PCI-34051 in MCF7 breast cancer cells, and examined the effects on transcription of cohesin-dependent genes that respond to estrogen. HDAC8 inhibition led to accumulation of ac-SMC3 as expected, but surprisingly, had no influence on the transcription of estrogen-responsive genes that are altered by siRNA targeting of RAD21 or SMC3. Knockdown of RAD21 altered estrogen receptor α (ER) recruitment at SOX4 and IL20, and affected transcription of these genes, while HDAC8 inhibition did not. Rather, inhibition of HDAC8 delayed cell cycle progression, suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis in a concentration-dependent manner. We conclude that HDAC8 inhibition does not change the estrogen-specific transcriptional role of cohesin in MCF7 cells, but instead, compromises cell cycle progression and cell survival. Our results argue that candidate inhibitors of cohesin function may differ in their effects depending on the cellular genotype and should be thoroughly tested for predicted effects on cohesin's mechanistic roles. ? 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Acetylation; Cell death; Cell proliferation; Cells; Chromosomes; Cytology; Diseases; Gene expression; Gene therapy; Genes; Cell-cycle progression; Concentration-dependent manners; Estrogen receptor; Induced apoptosis; MCF-7 breast cancer cells; Protein complexes; Specific inhibitors; Therapeutic targets; Transcription; cell protein; cohesin; estrogen receptor alpha; histone deacetylase 8; histone deacetylase inhibitor; interleukin 20; pci 34051; small interfering RNA; SMC3 protein; transcription factor Sox4; unclassified drug; cell cycle protein; cohesin; estrogen; estrogen receptor; HDAC8 protein, human; histone deacetylase; hydroxamic acid; indole derivative; nonhistone protein; nuclear protein; PCI 34051; phosphoprotein; proteochondroitin sulfate; RAD21 protein, human; repressor protein; SMC3 protein, human; Article; cell cycle progression; cell viability; concentration (parameters); controlled study; deacetylation; enzyme inhibition; gene; gene targeting; genetic transcription; genotype; IL20 gene; MCF 7 cell line; priority journal; protein function; protein protein interaction; RAD21 gene; SOX4 gene; transcription initiation; acetylation; antagonists and inhibitors; apoptosis; breast tumor; cell cycle checkpoint; cell proliferation; confocal microscopy; dose response; drug effects; female; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; human; immunoblotting; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; pathology; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; Acetylation; Apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Proliferation; Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycans; Chromosomal Proteins, Non-Histone; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Estrogens; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Histone Deacetylases; Humans; Hydroxamic Acids; Immunoblotting; Indoles; MCF-7 Cells; Microscopy, Confocal; Nuclear Proteins; Phosphoproteins; Receptors, Estrogen; Repressor Proteins; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA Interference; Transcription, Genetic",2-s2.0-84974633238

This study aims to explore the experience of treating gout among primary care clinicians and understand the perceived barriers to effective therapy. Methods: Fourteen health professionals from primary care practices in South Auckland were recruited. Each participated in a semi-structured interview exploring their experience of treating and managing gout patients were analysed thematically. Findings: Participants described the large burden of gout in their communities and the importance of the clinician–patient relationship in gout management. Four themes summarise the perceived barriers to effective urate lowering therapy (ULT); unique gout factors, eg its intermittent nature and potential for stigmatisation; systemic barriers to optimal treatment, or barriers that emerge from working within a certain organisation; uncertainty about ownership, or who should carry responsibility for overcoming barriers to optimal treatment; and cultural barriers to optimal treatment. Conclusion: Clinicians in primary practice perceive gout management to be mainly acute rather than preventive care. Patients may be stigmatised and management difficult particularly when diet is emphasised over ULT. Practice nurses are a group potentially available and willing to assist in educating patients.

Methods: Children aged 0 to14 years hospitalised with pleural empyema or PPE were retrospectively identified. Empyema was defined by ultrasound and pleural tap criteria. PPE was defined as the presence of pleural fluid on chest xray not fulfilling empyema criteria. Epidemiology, clinical features, microbiology and outcomes of empyema and PPE were compared and incidence rates analysed. Results: Of 184 cases identified, 104 met the criteria for empyema. Empyema incidence increased from 1 per 100 000 children aged 0 to 14 years in 1998 to 10 per 100 000 in 2012, with a peak incidence of 13 per 100 000 in 2009. Staphylococcus aureus was most frequently detected (n=38), followed by Streptococcus pneumoniae (n=31). Cases of S. aureus empyema increased 4 fold over the 15 years. Dominant S. pneumoniae serotypes were 1 and 14. Thirty-five percent of empyema and 53% of PPE cases received pre-hospital antibiotics. Children who received pre-hospital antibiotics were more than 40% less likely to require surgical intervention than those not pre-treated. Conclusions: Childhood empyema incidence has increased markedly in South Auckland. Paediatric S. aureus empyema is becoming increasingly common in South Auckland. Pre-hospital antibiotic prescribing may mitigate the need for surgical intervention in our population. ? 2016 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",antibiotic prescription; pleural empyema; pneumococcus; staphylococcus; vaccine,antibiotic agent; adolescent; antibiotic therapy; Article; child; clinical feature; community acquired pneumonia; controlled study; female; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; incidence; infant; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; New Zealand; outcome assessment; parapneumonic effusion; pathophysiology; pleura effusion; pleura empyema; population distribution; prescription; priority journal; retrospective study; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; thoracotomy; thorax radiography; treatment indication; tuberculous pleurisy; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery,2-s2.0-84976507630

Disruption to this barrier through inflammation is a major contributor to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The amyloid beta (Aβ) protein is known to exist in several forms and is a key modulator of AD that is known to cause inflammation and changes to BBB function. While one of these forms, fibrillary Aβ (fAβ), is known to cause endothelial cell death at the BBB, no studies have looked specifically at its role on inflammation in a model of the human BBB. Aims To determine if fAβ is inflammatory to the human BBB. As statins have been shown to be anti-inflammatory and protective in AD, we also tested if these could inhibit the inflammatory effect of fAβ. Methods Using cultured cerebral endothelial cells and astrocytes we determined changes in cytokine release, cell toxicity and barrier function in response to fibrillary β-amyloid1-42 (fAβ1-42 ) alone and in combination with statins. Results fAβ1-42 induced inflammatory cytokine release from endothelial cells in the absence of cell toxicity. It also induced astrocyte cytokine release and cell death and caused a loss of barrier integrity. Statin treatment inhibited all of these effects. Conclusions We conclude that fAβ1-42 has both inflammatory and cytotoxic effects on the BBB and the protective effect of statins in AD may in part be through inhibiting these effects. ? 2016 Griffin et al.

Over this time until December 2014, LT took place in 3700 adults and 800 children. LT is regulated with 1 unit, supported by the government, per state or region. Currently approximately 270 transplants take place per year. Organ donation rates are moderate in Australia (17 per 1 million of population) but very low in New Zealand (11 per 1 million of population). All the units share organ donors for fulminant hepatic failure cases (status 1). Recipient listing criteria and organ allocation criteria are commonly agreed to via National and Trans-Tasman agreements, which are published online. Current survival rates indicate approximately 94% 1-year survival with median survival in adults of approximately 20 years, whereas 75% of children are alive at 20 years. All units collaborate in research projects via the Australia and New Zealand Liver Transplant Registry and have published highly cited articles particularly on the prevention of hepatitis B virus recurrence. Outcomes for indigenous populations have also been analyzed.

However, robust evidence of the cost-effectiveness of pricing manipulations on dietary behaviour is limited. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of a 20% price reduction on fruits and vegetables and a combined skills-based behaviour change and price reduction intervention. Design and methods: Cost-effectiveness analysis from a societal perspective was undertaken for the randomized controlled trial Supermarket Healthy Eating for Life (SHELf). Female shoppers in Melbourne, Australia were randomized to: (1) skill-building (n = 160); (2) price reductions (n = 161); (3) combined skill-building and price reduction (n = 161); or (4) control group (n = 161). The intervention was implemented for three months followed by a six month follow-up. Costs were measured in 2012 Australian dollars. Fruit and vegetable purchasing and consumption were measured in grams/week. Results: At three months, compared to control participants, price reduction participants increased vegetable purchases by 233 g/week (95% CI 4 to 462, p = 0.046) and fruit purchases by 364 g/week (95% CI 95 to 633, p = 0.008). Participants in the combined group purchased 280 g/week more fruits (95% CI 27 to 533, p = 0.03) than participants in the control group. Increases were not maintained six-month post intervention. No effect was noticed in the skill-building group. Compared to the control group, the price reduction intervention cost an additional A$2.3 per increased serving of vegetables purchased per week or an additional A$3 per increased serving of fruit purchased per week. The combined intervention cost an additional A$12 per increased serving of fruit purchased per week compared to the control group. Conclusions: A 20% discount on fruits and vegetables was effective in promoting overall fruit and vegetable purchases during the period the discount was active and may be cost-effective.

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 is overexpressed in many types of cancers including HCC and promotes its metastasis. Meloxicam is a selective COX-2 inhibitor that has been reported to exert an anti-proliferation and invasion/migration response in various tumors. In this study,we examined the role of meloxicam on HCC cell proliferation and migration and explored the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect. We found that meloxicam inhibited HCC cell proliferation and had a cell cycle arrest effect in human HCC cells. Furthermore,meloxicam suppressed the ability of HCC cells expressing higher levels of COX-2 and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) to migration via potentiating expression of E-cadherin and alleviating expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and -9. COX-2/PGE2 has been considered to activate the β-catenin signaling pathway which promotes cancer cell migration. We found that treatment with PGE2 significantly enhanced nuclear accumulation of β-catenin and the activation of GSK3β which could be reversed by meloxicam in HCC cells. We also observed that HCC cell migration and upregulation of the level of MMP-2/9 and downregulation of E-cadherin induced by PGE2 were suppressed by FH535,an inhibitor of β-catenin. Taken together,these findings provide a new treatment strategy against HCC proliferation and migration.",COX-2/PGE2; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Meloxicam; Migration; β-catenin signaling pathway,"cyclooxygenase 2; fh 535; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; meloxicam; prostaglandin E2; protein inhibitor; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; beta catenin; cadherin; CDH1 protein, human; cyclooxygenase 2; FH535; gelatinase A; gelatinase B; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; meloxicam; MMP2 protein, human; MMP9 protein, human; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin synthase inhibitor; PTGS2 protein, human; small interfering RNA; sulfonamide; thiazine derivative; thiazole derivative; Article; cancer inhibition; carcinoma cell; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle G1 phase; cell migration; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme activation; human; human cell; in vitro study; liver cell carcinoma; priority journal; protein expression; protein targeting; signal transduction; upregulation; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; cell cycle checkpoint; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; drug effects; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; Liver Neoplasms; metabolism; pathology; RNA interference; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; beta Catenin; Cadherins; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cyclooxygenase 2; Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors; Dinoprostone; Enzyme Activation; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Matrix Metalloproteinase 2; Matrix Metalloproteinase 9; Neoplasm Invasiveness; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; Sulfonamides; Thiazines; Thiazoles",2-s2.0-84964905354

Objective To determine rare and potentially functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with the risk of COPD and severity of airflow limitation. Methods 3226 current or former smokers of European ancestry with lung function measures indicative of Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2 COPD or worse were genotyped using an exome array. An analysis of risk of COPD was carried out using ever smoking controls (n=4784). Associations with % predicted FEV1 were tested in cases. We followed-up signals of interest (p&lt;10-5) in independent samples from a subset of the UK Biobank population and also undertook a more powerful discovery study by metaanalysing the exome array data and UK Biobank data for variants represented on both arrays. Results Among the associated variants were two in regions previously unreported for COPD; a low frequency non-synonymous SNP in MOCS3 (rs7269297, pdiscovery =3.08×10-6, preplication =0.019) and a rare SNP in IFIT3, which emerged in the meta-analysis (rs140549288, pmeta =8.56×10-6). In the meta-analysis of % predicted FEV1 in cases, the strongest association was shown for a splice variant in a previously unreported region, SERPINA12 (rs140198372, pmeta =5.72×10-6). We also confirmed previously reported associations with COPD risk at MMP12, HHIP, GPR126 and CHRNA5. No associations in novel regions reached a stringent exome-wide significance threshold (p&lt;3.7×10-7).

Gastroparesis affects the gastric slow wave, but non-invasive assessment has been limited to the electrogastrogram (EGG), which reliably characterizes temporal dynamics but does not provide spatial information. Methods: We measured gastric slow wave parameters from the EGG and magnetogastrogram (MGG) in patients with gastroparesis and in healthy controls. In addition to dominant frequency (DF) and percentage power distribution (PPD), we measured the propagation velocity from MGG spatiotemporal patterns and the percentage of slow wave coupling (%SWC) from EGG. Key Results: No significant difference in DF was found between patients and controls. Gastroparesis patients had lower percentages of normogastric frequencies (60 ± 6% vs 78 ± 4%, p < 0.05), and higher brady (9 ± 2% vs 2 ± 1%, p < 0.05) and tachygastric (31 ± 2% vs 19 ± 1%, p < 0.05) frequency content postprandial, indicative of uncoupling. Propagation patterns were substantially different in patients and longitudinal propagation velocity was retrograde at 4.3 ± 2.9 mm/s vs anterograde at 7.4 ± 1.0 mm/s for controls (p < 0.01). No difference was found in %SWC from EGG. Conclusions & Inferences: Gastric slow wave parameters obtained from MGG recordings distinguish gastroparesis patients from controls. Assessment of slow wave propagation may prove critical to characterization of underlying disease processes. Future studies should determine pathologic indicators from MGG associated with other functional gastric disorders, and whether multichannel EGG with appropriate signal processing also reveals pathology.",Electrogastrogram; Functional gastric disorders; Magnetogastrogram,adult; Article; clinical article; controlled study; diabetic stomach paresis; electrode; electrogastrography; female; gastric slow wave; human; magnetic field; male; middle aged; priority journal; stomach parameters; complication; diabetes mellitus; gastrointestinal motility; magnetometry; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; stomach emptying; stomach paresis; Adult; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Gastric Emptying; Gastrointestinal Motility; Gastroparesis; Humans; Magnetometry; Middle Aged,2-s2.0-84956897993

Method: Female cigarette smokers (n = 413) participating in a supervised exercise and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) smoking cessation program were randomized to one of four conditions: exercise + smoking cessation maintenance, exercise maintenance + contact control, smoking cessation maintenance + contact control or contact control. The primary outcome was continuous smoking abstinence. Results: Abstinence differences were found between the exercise and equal contact non-exercise maintenance groups at weeks 14 (57 vs 43?%), 26 (27 vs 21?%) and 56 (26 vs 23.5?%), respectively. Only the week 14 difference approached significance, p = 0.08. Conclusions: An exercise-aided NRT smoking cessation program with built-in maintenance components enhances post-intervention cessation rates at week 14 but not at weeks 26 and 56. ? 2016, The Society of Behavioral Medicine.",Exercise; Maintenance; NRT; Smoking cessation,controlled clinical trial; controlled study; exercise; female; human; major clinical study; nicotine replacement therapy; randomized controlled trial; smoking cessation; smoking cessation program; adolescent; adult; aged; cognitive therapy; exercise; male; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; physiology; procedures; psychology; smoking cessation; tobacco dependence; treatment outcome; young adult; nicotine gum; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cognitive Therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Use Cessation Products; Tobacco Use Disorder; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84954550901

Design: Cross-sectional online survey of nutrition-related child-care policy and practice. Written nutrition policies were analysed using the Wellness Child Care Assessment Tool. Setting: Licensed child-care services in the Auckland, Counties Manukau and Waikato regions of New Zealand. Subjects: Eight hundred and forty-seven services (private and community day care, kindergartens and playcentres). Results: Managers/head teachers of 257 child-care services completed the survey. Of services, 82·4 % had a written food, nutrition or wellness policy. Most policies did not refer to the national Food and Nutrition Guidelines and lacked directives for staff regarding recommended behaviours to promote healthy eating. Food was provided daily to children in 56·4 % of child-care services, including 33·5 % that provided lunch and at least two other meals/snacks every day. Teachers talked to children about food, and cooked with children, at least weekly in 60 % of child-care services. Nearly all services had an edible garden (89·5 %). Foods/beverages were sold for fundraising in the past 12 months by 37·2 % of services. The most commonly reported barrier to promoting nutrition was a lack of support from families (20·6 %). Conclusions: Although the majority of child-care services had a written nutrition policy, these were not comprehensive and contained weak statements that could be difficult to action. Foods served at celebrations and for fundraising were largely high in sugar, salt and/or saturated fat. Most services promoted some healthy eating behaviours but other widespread practices encouraged children to overeat or form unhealthy food preferences. ?

Although most adrenal incidentalomas are benign non-functioning adenomas, lesions may be hormonally active and/or malignant. The aim of this study was to determine adherence to recommended international guidelines and potential influencing factors when an adrenal incidentaloma is identified in routine clinical practice. Methods: A retrospective study was performed of all CT and MRI reports from December 2009 to December 2011 using a key phrase search to identify patients with an incidental adrenal lesion. Results: A total of 125 patients with incidental adrenal lesions were identified, of which 74 patients were considered appropriate for further endocrine/radiological workup. Of the 74 patients, only 19 (26%) were initially referred to the endocrine service for investigation; 21/74 (28%) had complete biochemical workup and 24/74 (32%) had imaging follow-up arranged. The reporting radiologist provided advice for follow-up in 31/74 (42%), and action was more likely to be taken when this recommendation was given. Follow-up of the patients who had not received investigation was attempted resulting in assessment of a further 23 patients. Of the 44 patients who have undergone full assessment, four patients were found to have clinically significant lesions (one each of: Cushing's syndrome, phaeochromocytoma, Conn's syndrome and plasmacytoma). Conclusion: This study suggests that the majority of adrenal incidentalomas may not be investigated according to current international guidelines. The recommendations by the reporting radiologist appear to influence whether a patient is referred for further investigation. ? 2016 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.",Adrenal cortex neoplasm; Adrenal gland neoplasm; Adrenalectomy; Adrenocortical adenoma; Health care; Quality assurance,"Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; adult; aged; female; follow up; human; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; protocol compliance; reproducibility; retrospective study; standards; time factor; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84904715187

Our aim was to compare estimates of nutrient exposure from a store survey of packaged food with those from household panel food purchases. A cross-sectional store survey of all packaged foods for sale in two major supermarkets was undertaken in Auckland, New Zealand, between February and May 2012. Longitudinal household food purchase data (November 2011 to October 2012) were obtained from the nationally representative, population-weighted New Zealand Nielsen HomeScan? panel. Data on 8440 packaged food and non-alcoholic beverage products were collected in the store survey. Food purchase data were available for 1229 households and 16 812 products. Store survey data alone produced higher estimates of exposure to Na and sugar compared with estimates from household panel food purchases. The estimated mean difference in exposure to Na was 94 (95 % CI 72, 115) mg/100 g (20 % relative difference; P<0·01), to sugar 1·6 (95 % CI 0·8, 2·5) g/100 g (11 %; P<0·01), to SFA -0·3 (95 % CI -0·8, 0·3) g/100 g (6 %; P=0·3) and to energy -18 (-71, 35) kJ/100 g (2 %; P=0·51). Compared with household panel food purchases, store survey data provided a reasonable estimate of average population exposure to key nutrients from packaged foods. However, caution should be exercised in using such data to estimate population exposure to Na and sugar and in generalising these findings to other countries, as well as over time. ?

We aimed to describe dietary patterns of 5664 pregnant women from the Growing Up in New Zealand study, and investigate associations between these patterns and maternal socio-demographic, place of birth, health and lifestyle factors. Participants completed a food frequency questionnaire prior to the birth of their child. Principal components analysis was used to extract dietary patterns and multivariable analyses used to determine associations. Four dietary components were extracted. Higher scores on, ‘Junk’ and ‘Traditional/White bread’, were associated with decreasing age, lower educational levels, being of Pacific or M?ori ethnicity and smoking. Higher scores on, ‘Health conscious’ and ‘Fusion/Protein’, were associated with increasing age, better self-rated health, lower pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) and not smoking. Higher scores on ‘Junk’ and ‘Health conscious’ were associated with being born in New Zealand (NZ), whereas higher scores on ‘Fusion/Protein’ was associated with being born outside NZ and being of non-European ethnicity, particularly Asian. High scores on the ‘Health conscious’ dietary pattern showed the highest odds of adherence to the pregnancy dietary guidelines. In this cohort of pregnant women different dietary patterns were associated with migration, ethnicity, socio-demographic characteristics, health behaviors and adherence to dietary guidelines. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Dietary patterns; Ethnicity; Pregnancy; Principal component analysis,body mass; child; diet; ethnicity; extract; female; food frequency questionnaire; health behavior; human; lifestyle; major clinical study; New Zealand; practice guideline; pregnancy; pregnant woman; principal component analysis; smoking; adolescent; adult; classification; diet; feeding behavior; food; health behavior; maternal nutrition; middle aged; New Zealand; pregnancy; social class; socioeconomics; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Diet Surveys; Feeding Behavior; Female; Food; Health Behavior; Humans; Life Style; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Pregnancy; Prenatal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84969506918

However, the ability to accurately recall sleep practices during pregnancy has been questioned. The aim of this study is to test the accuracy of recall of normal sleep practices in late pregnancy. Methods: Thirty healthy women between 35 and 38weeks of gestation underwent level III respiratory polysomnography (PSG) with infrared digital video recordings in their own homes. Data regarding sleep positions, number of times getting out of bed during the night and respiratory measures were collected. A sleep questionnaire was administered the morning after the recorded sleep. Continuous data were assessed using Spearman's Rho and Bland-Altman. Cohen's Kappa was used to assess recall in the categorical variables. Results: Two-thirds of participants went to sleep on their left side. There was good agreement in sleep onset position between video and questionnaire data (Kappa 0.52), however the there was poor agreement on position on wakening (Kappa 0.24). The number of times getting out of bed during the night was accurately recalled (Kappa 0.65). Twenty five out of 30 participants snored as recorded by PSG. Questionnaire data was inaccurate for this measure. Bland-Altman plots demonstrated acceptable agreement between video and questionnaire data for estimated sleep duration, but not the time taken to fall asleep (sleep latency). One participant had mild obstructive sleep apnoea and another probable high upper airways resistance. Conclusions: Sleep onset position, sleep duration and the number of times getting out of bed during the night were accurately recalled, but sleep latency and sleep position on waking were not.

Animal models and anecdotal clinical evidence indicate a potential role of hGH and hPRL in HCC. However, the prognostic relevance and the functional role of tumor expression of these hormones in human HCC are not defined. Herein, we analyzed the mRNA and protein expression of hGH and hPRL in histopathological samples of non-neoplastic liver and HCC by in situ hybridization, PCR and immunohistochemistry techniques. Increased mRNA and protein expression of both hormones was observed in HCC compared with non-neoplastic liver tissues. hGH expression was significantly associated with tumor size and tumor grade. No significant association was observed between the expression of hPRL and any histopathological features. Amplification of both hGH and hPRL genes in HCC was observed when compared to non-neoplastic tissue. Expression of both hGH and hPRL was associated with worse relapse-free and overall survival in HCC patients. In vitro and in vivo functional assays performed with HCC cell lines demonstrated that autocrine expression of hGH or hPRL in HCC cells increased STAT3 activation, oncogenicity and tumor growth while functional antagonism with hGH-G120R significantly reduced these parameters.

We examined the association of maternal feeding patterns with glycaemic levels among lean and overweight pregnant women. In a prospective cohort study in Singapore, maternal 24-h dietary recalls, fasting glucose (FG) and 2-h postprandial glucose (2HPPG) concentrations were measured at 26-28 weeks of gestation. Women (n 985) were classified into lean (BMI&lt;23 kg/m2) or overweight (BMI?23 kg/m2) groups. They were further categorised as predominantly daytime (pDT) or predominantly night-time (pNT) feeders according to consumption of greater proportion of energy content from 07.00 to 18.59 hours or from 19.00 to 06.59 hours, respectively. On stratification by weight status, lean pNT feeders were found to have higher FG than lean pDT feeders (4.36 (sd 0.38) v. 4.22 (sd 0.35) mmol/l; P=0.002); however, such differences were not observed between overweight pDT and pNT feeders (4.49 (sd 0.60) v. 4.46 (sd 0.45) mmol/l; P=0.717). Using multiple linear regression with confounder adjustment, pNT feeding was associated with higher FG in the lean group (β=0.16 mmol/l; 95 % CI 0.05, 0.26; P=0.003) but not in the overweight group (β=0.02 mmol/l; 95 % CI -0.17, 0.20; P=0.879). No significant association was found between maternal feeding pattern and 2HPPG in both the lean and the overweight groups. In conclusion, pNT feeding was associated with higher FG concentration in lean but not in overweight pregnant women, suggesting that there may be an adiposity-dependent effect of maternal feeding patterns on glucose tolerance during pregnancy.

METHODS: We undertook a survey of all the managers of rural hospitals in New Zealand. We also analysed the Medical Council data relevant to doctors with a vocational scope of rural hospital medicine, followed by online surveys of rural hospital doctors and registrars in training. RESULTS: There were 26 rural hospitals identified. 18/26 (69%) directly employed medical staff. Managers identified a shortage of rural hospital doctors, although this was much improved compared to 2009. While most vocationally registered doctors working in rural hospitals were older, male and predominantly international medical graduates, we found that registrars in training were more likely to be female, from a rural background and to have trained in New Zealand. Seventy-five percent of rural trainees are either trained in general practice or are pursuing dual training. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides useful information for rural hospital managers, clinical leaders and others involved in workforce planning. While there has been a reduction of the workforce shortages of a few years ago, there are still shortages for many hospitals.

It is frequently managed by providing infants with an alternative source of glucose, given enterally with formula or intravenously with dextrose solution. This often requires that mother and baby are cared for in separate environments and may inhibit breast feeding. Dextrose gel is simple and inexpensive and can be administered directly to the buccal mucosa for rapid correction of hypoglycaemia, in association with continued breast feeding and maternal care. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of dextrose gel in correcting hypoglycaemia and in reducing long-term neurodevelopmental impairment. Search methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Web of Science from inception of the database to February 2016. We also searched international clinical trials networks and handsearched proceedings of specific scientific meetings. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised studies comparing dextrose gel versus placebo, no treatment or other therapies for treatment of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted data and did not assess publications for which they themselves were study authors. Main results: We included two trials involving 312 infants. No data were available for correction of hypoglycaemia for each hypoglycaemic event. We found no evidence of a difference between dextrose gel and placebo gel for major neurosensory disability at two-year follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 6.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.77 to 51.03; one trial, n = 184; quality of evidence very low). Dextrose gel compared with placebo gel or no gel did not alter the need for intravenous treatment for hypoglycaemia (typical RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.46 to 1.32; two trials, 312 infants; quality of evidence very low). Infants treated with dextrose gel were less likely to be separated from their mothers for treatment of hypoglycaemia (RR 0.54, 95% CI 0.31 to 0.93; one trial, 237 infants; quality of evidence moderate) and were more likely to be exclusively breast fed after discharge (RR 1.10, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.18; one trial, 237 infants; quality of evidence moderate). Estimated rise in blood glucose concentration following dextrose gel was 0.4 mmol/L (95% CI -0.14 to 0.94; one trial, 75 infants). Investigators in one trial reported no adverse outcomes (n = 237 infants). Authors' conclusions: Treatment of infants with neonatal hypoglycaemia with 40% dextrose gel reduces the incidence of mother-infant separation for treatment and increases the likelihood of full breast feeding after discharge compared with placebo gel. No evidence suggests occurrence of adverse effects during the neonatal period or at two years' corrected age. Oral dextrose gel should be considered first-line treatment for infants with neonatal hypoglycaemia. ? 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Receptors for amylin and calcitonin are targets for treating obesity, diabetes, and bone disorders. CGRP receptors represent a target for pain and migraine. Amylin receptors (AMY) are a heterodimer formed by the coexpression of CTR with receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs). CTR with RAMP1 responds potently to both amylin and CGRP. The brain stem is a major site of action for circulating amylin and is a rich site of CGRP binding. This study aimed to enhance our understanding of these hormone systems by mapping CTR expression in the human brain stem, specifically the medulla oblongata. Widespread CTR-like immunoreactivity was observed throughout the medulla. Dense CTR staining was noted in several discrete nuclei, including the nucleus of the solitary tract, the hypoglossal nucleus, the cuneate nucleus, spinal trigeminal nucleus, the gracile nucleus, and the inferior olivary nucleus. CTR staining was also observed in the area postrema, the lateral reticular nucleus, and the pyramidal tract. The extensive expression of CTR in the medulla suggests that CTR may be involved in a wider range of functions than currently appreciated. ? 2016 the American Physiological Society.",Amylin; Brain stem; Calcitonin gene-related peptide; Migraine; Obesity,"calcitonin receptor; messenger RNA; antibody; calcitonin receptor; aged; area postrema; Article; brain mapping; controlled study; cuneate nucleus; gene expression; gracile nucleus; human; human cell; hypoglossal nucleus; immunoreactivity; inferior olivary nucleus; lateral reticular nucleus; medulla oblongata; motoneuron; Nissl staining; normal human; priority journal; protein analysis; protein expression; protein function; pyramidal tract; solitary tract nucleus; spinal trigeminal nucleus; autoradiography; cohort analysis; gene expression regulation; genetics; immunology; medulla oblongata; metabolism; physiology; radioassay; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies; Autoradiography; Cohort Studies; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Medulla Oblongata; Radioligand Assay; Receptors, Calcitonin",2-s2.0-84984618911

A created search strategy was run against Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE and EMBASE classic, CINAHL, and AMED. The returned studies were initially screened, and 2 reviewers independently assessed the remaining studies for eligibility against prespecified criteria. Fourteen studies, of 387 initially identified, were included in this review, and the primary outcome measure was the effect of flavonoids on URTI incidence, duration, and severity. Of the included studies, flavonoid supplementation ranged from 0.2 to 1.2 g/d. Overall, flavonoid supplementation decreased URTI incidence by 33% (95% CI: 31%, 36%) compared with control, with no apparent adverse effects. Sick-day count was decreased by 40% with flavonoid supplementation, although unclear. Differences in bioimmune markers (e.g., interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-a, interferon-g, neutrophils) were trivial between the intervention and control groups during the intervention and after exercise when a postintervention exercise bout was included. These findings suggest that flavonoids are a viable supplement to decrease URTI incidence in an otherwise healthy population. ? 2016 American Society for Nutrition.",Common cold; Exercise; Flavonoids; Immune function; Meta-analysis; Polyphenols; Quercetin; Systematic review; Upper respiratory tract infection,cytokine; flavonoid; plant extract; dietary supplement; drug effects; female; human; immunity; immunology; male; meta analysis; metabolism; neutrophil; phytotherapy; Respiratory Tract Infections; Cytokines; Dietary Supplements; Female; Flavonoids; Humans; Immunity; Male; Neutrophils; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; Respiratory Tract Infections,2-s2.0-84971376340

The distribution of abdominal adipose tissue at birth may give insights into whether ethnicity-associated variations in metabolic risk originate partly in utero. Objective: We assessed the influence of ethnicity on abdominal adipose tissue compartments in Asian neonates in the Growing Up in Singapore Toward Healthy Outcomes mother-offspring cohort. Design: MRI was performed at #2 wk after birth in 333 neonates born at $34 wk of gestation and with birth weights $2000 g. Abdominal superficial subcutaneous tissue (sSAT), deep subcutaneous tissue (dSAT), and internal adipose tissue (IAT) compartment volumes (absolute and as a percentage of the total abdominal volume) were quantified. Results: In multivariate analyses that were controlled for sex, age, and parity, the absolute and percentage of dSATand the percentage of sSAT (but not absolute sSAT) were greater, whereas absolute IAT (but not the percentage of IAT) was lower, in Indian neonates than in Chinese neonates. Compared with Chinese neonates, Malay neonates had greater percentages of sSAT and dSAT but similar percentages of IAT. Marginal structural model analyses largely confirmed the results on the basis of volume percentages with controlled direct effects of ethnicity on abdominal adipose tissue; dSAT was significantly greater (1.45 mL; 95% CI: 0.49, 2.41 mL, P = 0.003) in non-Chinese (Indian or Malay) neonates than in Chinese neonates. However, ethnic differences in sSAT and IAT were NS [3.06 mL (95% CI:20.27, 6.39 mL; P = 0.0712) for sSAT and 21.30 mL (95% CI: 22.64, 0.04 mL; P = 0.057) for IAT in non-Chinese compared with Chinese neonates, respectively]. Conclusions: Indian and Malay neonates have a greater dSAT volume than do Chinese neonates. This finding supports the notion that in utero influences may contribute to higher cardiometabolic risk observed in Indian and Malay persons in our population. If such differences persist in the longitudinal tracking of adipose tissue growth, these differences may contribute to the ethnic disparities in risks of cardiometabolic diseases.

The three clinically relevant, well-characterized aPL are anti-cardiolipin antibodies, lupus anticoagulant and anti-beta-2-glycoprotein I (β2GPI) antibodies. aPL do not bind directly to phospholipids but instead bind to a plasma-binding 'cofactor'. The most extensively studied cofactor is β2GPI, whose role in pregnancy is not fully elucidated. Although the pathogenicity of aPL in recurrent pregnancy loss is well established in humans and animal models, the association of aPL with infertility does not appear to be causative. aPL may exert their detrimental effects during pregnancy by directly binding trophoblast cells of the placenta, altering trophoblast signalling, proliferation, invasion and secretion of hormones and cytokines, and by increasing apoptosis. Heparin is commonly used to treat pregnant women with aPL; however, as thrombotic events do not occur in the placentae of all women with aPL, it may exert a protective effect by preventing the binding of aPL to β2GPI or by acting through non-thrombotic pathways.

We assessed predictors of availability, uptake and timeliness of these vaccines in a rural Malawian setting. Methods: Commencing on the first date of PCV13 eligibility we conducted a prospective population-based birth cohort study of 2,616 children under demographic surveillance in Karonga District, northern Malawi who were eligible for PCV13, or from the date of RV1 introduction both PCV13 and RV1. Potential predictors of vaccine uptake and timeliness for PCV13, RV1 and MV were analysed respectively using robust Poisson and Cox regression. Results: Vaccine coverage was high for all vaccines, ranging from 86.9% for RV1 dose 2 to 95.4% for PCV13 dose 1. Median time delay for PCV13 dose 1 was 17 days (IQR 7-36), 19 days (IQR 8-36) for RV1 dose 1 and 20 days (IQR 3-46) for MV. Infants born to lower educated or farming mothers and those living further away from the road or clinic were at greater risk of being not fully vaccinated and being vaccinated late. Delays in vaccination were also associated with non-facility birth. Vaccine stock-outs resulted in both a delay in vaccine timeliness and in a decrease in completion of schedule. Conclusion: Despite high vaccination coverage in this setting, delays in vaccination were common. We identified programmatic and socio-demographic risk factors for uptake and timeliness of vaccination. Understanding who remains most vulnerable to be unvaccinated allows for focussed delivery thereby increasing population coverage and maximising the equitable benefits of universal vaccination programmes. ? 2016 Mvula et al.

To efficiently segment a 3-D lung, we extract voxel-wise features of spatial image contexts by unsupervised learning with a proposed incremental constrained nonnegative matrix factorization (ICNMF). The method applies smoothness constraints to learn the features, which are more robust to lung tissue inhomogeneities, and thus, help to better segment internal lung pathologies than the known state-of-the-art techniques. Compared to the latter, the ICNMF depends less on the domain expert knowledge and is more easily tuned due to only a few control parameters. Also, the proposed slice-wise incremental learning with due regard for interslice signal dependencies decreases the computational complexity of the NMF-based segmentation and is scalable to very large 3-D lung images. The method is quantitatively validated on simulated realistic lung phantoms that mimic different lung pathologies (seven datasets), in vivo datasets for 17 subjects, and 55 datasets from the Lobe and Lung Analysis 2011 (LOLA11) study. For the in vivo data, the accuracy of our segmentation w.r.t. the ground truth is 0.96 by the Dice similarity coefficient, 9.0 mm by the modified Hausdorff distance, and 0.87% by the absolute lung volume difference, which is significantly better than for the NMF-based segmentation. In spite of not being designed for lungs with severe pathologies and of no agreement between radiologists on the ground truth in such cases, the ICNMF with its total accuracy of 0.965 was ranked fifth among all others in the LOLA11. After excluding the nine too pathological cases from the LOLA11 dataset, the ICNMF accuracy increased to 0.986. ? 2015 IEEE.",Constrained nonnegative matrix factorization; incremental learning; lung segmentation,"Biological organs; Computerized tomography; Factorization; Image segmentation; Pathology; Computed tomography images; Domain expert knowledge; Incremental learning; Lung segmentation; Modified Hausdorff Distance; Nonnegative matrix factorization; Similarity coefficients; State-of-the-art techniques; Matrix algebra; Article; computer assisted tomography; human; image reconstruction; incremental constrained nonnegative matrix factorization; lung parenchyma; lung volume; machine learning; radiologist; statistical analysis; three dimensional imaging; three dimensional lung segmentation; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; factual database; lung; Lung Neoplasms; procedures; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Databases, Factual; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Lung; Lung Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84968610503

Beyond theselimitations, phosphoproteomics has the potential to play a pivotal role in translational studies and contribute to advancesin different tumour groups, including rare disease sites like sarcoma. In this review, we propose that deploying phosphoproteomictechnologies in translational research may facilitate the identification of better defined predictive biomarkers forpatient stratification, inform drug selection in umbrella trials and identify new combinations to overcome drug resistance.We provide an overview of current phosphoproteomic technologies, such as affinity-based assays and mass spectrometry-based approaches, and discuss their advantages and limitations. We use sarcoma as an example to illustrate thecurrent challenges in evaluating targeted kinase therapies in clinical trials. We then highlight useful lessons from preclinicalstudies in sarcoma biology to demonstrate how phosphoproteomics may address some of these challenges.

This study explored the prevalence and motivations for CE use in a New Zealand university. Design and Methods: Students from the Schools of Pharmacy, Nursing, Medicine, Law and Accounting at a university in New Zealand were invited to complete a paper-based questionnaire that elicited their views on the prevalence, reasons for use and attitudes towards use of CEs. Questionnaires were distributed at the end of a third-year lecture (August-October 2012). Reasons for use and attitudes towards use was measured using a 7-point Likert scale from strongly agree (1) to strongly disagree (7). Descriptive and prevalence statistics were calculated. Inferential statistics were generated to explore the overall associations between CE use and how the respondents had first learnt about CEs, and to investigate reasons for CE use. Results: The response fraction was 88.6 % (442/499) and the prevalence of CE use was 6.6% (95% confidence interval 4.5-9.0). Commonly cited reasons for use were to get high [M=4.43, standard deviation (SD) 2.36], experimentation (M=4.17, SD 2.36), increase alertness (M=3.55, SD 2.48), to help concentrate (M=3.48, SD 2.42), to help stay awake (M=3.20, SD 2.33), to help study (M=3.10, SD 2.47) and to concentrate better while studying (M=3.00, SD 2.43). Discussion and Conclusions: Use of CEs was uncommon in contrast to the prevalence reported in the USA. The reasons for use also varied depending on which CE was used.

Methods Sixty community-dwelling adults older than 65 years were enrolled in the study. Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks and included proprioception (ankle joint position sense), postural stability (static posturography), sensorimotor function (choice stepping reaction time), multisensory integration (sound-induced flash illusion), and health-related quality of life (SF-36). Results Over 12 weeks, the chiropractic group improved compared with the control group in choice stepping reaction time (119 milliseconds; 95% confidence interval [CI], 26-212 milliseconds; P =.01) and sound-induced flash illusion (13.5%; 95% CI, 2.9%-24.0%; P =.01). Ankle joint position sense improved across the 4- and 12-week assessments (0.20°; 95% CI, 0.01°-0.39°; P =.049). Improvements were also seen between weeks 4 and 12 in the SF-36 physical component of quality of life (2.4; 95% CI, 0.04-4.8; P =.04) compared with control. Conclusion Sensorimotor function and multisensory integration associated with fall risk and the physical component of quality of life improved in older adults receiving chiropractic care compared with control. Future research is needed to investigate the mechanisms of action that contributed to the observed changes in this study and whether chiropractic care has an impact on actual falls risk in older adults. ? 2016 National University of Health Sciences.","Accidental Falls; Aged; Chiropractic; Feedback, Sensory; Postural Balance; Proprioception; Quality of Life","aged; Article; chiropractic; chiropractic practice; chiropractor; controlled study; fall risk; falling; female; high risk patient; human; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; outcome assessment; proprioception; randomized controlled trial; response time; sensorimotor function; Short Form 36; therapy effect; treatment duration; visual stimulation; body equilibrium; chiropractic manipulation; falling; physiology; prevention and control; procedures; quality of life; reaction time; sensation; single blind procedure; very elderly; walking; Accidental Falls; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Manipulation, Chiropractic; Postural Balance; Proprioception; Quality of Life; Reaction Time; Sensation; Single-Blind Method; Walking",2-s2.0-84961875799

Jowsey T.,35753379600;,Time and chronic illness: a narrative review,2016,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84945585805&doi=10.1007%2fs11136-015-1169-2&partnerID=40&md5=905af988b8409be417026223f0c8bd15,"Purpose: This narrative review is concerned with the ways in which the relationships between time and chronic illnesses have been chartered in recent literature. It aims to identify types of time (referred to here as temporal structures) most commonly reported in chronic illness literature and to assess their bearing on people’s lived experiences. Methods: Literature searches of three electronic databases (Google Scholar, MEDLINE, and PubMed) were carried out in November 2014 of articles published between 1970 and 2013 using the following search terms (and derivatives): chronic illness AND time AND (patient OR carer). The review followed four procedural steps: (a) comprehensive search, (b) temporal structure appraisal, (c) synthesis of findings, and (d) critical appraisal. Results: Forty studies met the inclusion criteria and were included for review. Four types of called temporal structures had a strong presence in the literature: calendar and clocked time, biographical time, past–present–future time, and inner time and rhythms. The first three temporal structures are largely understood socially, and the fourth is predominantly understood in and through the body. Several studies reported more than one temporal structure as informing people’s chronic illness experiences. A wide array of chronic illnesses were represented in these studies. Few studies reported on the experiences of people with multi-morbid chronic illnesses. Conclusion: Chronic illness induces new relationships to time. Drawing on Hyden (Sociol Health Illn 19(1):48–69, 1997), it is suggested that “narrative” storytelling—as a temporally informed analytic device—might prove effective for reconciling the tensions emergent from new and multiple relationships to time that chronic and multiple illnesses create. Opportunities exist for healthcare practitioners and health services to offer patients illness support that is cognisant of their relationships to time. ? 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Biographical; Chronic illness; Literature review; Narrative; Qualitative; Time,chronic disease; human; Review; rhythm; storytelling; time; caregiver; chronic disease; psychology; quality of life; time factor; Caregivers; Chronic Disease; Humans; Quality of Life; Time Factors,2-s2.0-84945585805

Understanding these values for individuals and across healthcare professions can help improve patient-centred decision-making by individual practitioners and interprofessional teams, respectively. We aimed to identify these values and integrate them into a single framework using Schwartz’s values model. We searched Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL and ERIC databases for articles on personal and professional values of healthcare practitioners and students. We extracted values from included papers and synthesized them into a single framework using Schwartz’s values model. We summarised the framework within the context of healthcare practice. We identified 128 values from 50 included articles from doctors, nurses and allied health professionals. A new framework for the identified values established the following broad healthcare practitioner values, corresponding to Schwartz values (in parentheses): authority (power); capability (achievement); pleasure (hedonism); intellectual stimulation (stimulation); critical-thinking (self-direction); equality (universalism); altruism (benevolence); morality (tradition); professionalism (conformity); safety (security) and spirituality (spirituality). The most prominent values identified were altruism, equality and capability. This review identified a comprehensive set of personal and professional values of healthcare practitioners. We integrated these into a single framework derived from Schwartz’s values model. This framework can be used to assess personal and professional values of healthcare practitioners across professional groups, and can help improve practitioners’ awareness of their values so they can negotiate more patient-centred decisions. A common values framework across professional groups can support shared education strategies on values and help improve interprofessional teamwork and decision-making. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Clinical decision-making; Clinical education; Healthcare practitioners; Interprofessional practice; Personal values; Professional values; Schwartz’s values model,"clinical decision making; ethics; health care personnel; human; medical ethics; patient care; psychological model; psychology; social psychology; Clinical Decision-Making; Ethics, Clinical; Health Personnel; Humans; Models, Psychological; Patient Care Team; Patient-Centered Care; Social Values",2-s2.0-84937828901

Some retailers have stopped selling tobacco. Therefore, we investigated how willing New Zealand convenience store owners were to stop selling tobacco or sell nicotine replacement therapy. Promotion of their stores was offered as an incentive to stop selling tobacco. Methods We asked convenience store owners in the Auckland metropolitan region of New Zealand to choose one of three actions. The first was to stop selling tobacco for a short period of time; the second was to restrict the hours that they sold tobacco; the third was to display and sell nicotine replacement therapy. All participating retailers completed a short interview about selling tobacco. We also surveyed customers about nicotine replacement and cessation. Results One-third of eligible retailers agreed to participate. Most who participated (93%) were unwilling to stop or restrict tobacco sales and 2 (7%) had already stopped selling tobacco. Tobacco was perceived as a key product for their businesses. Very few customers who purchased cigarettes noticed nicotine replacement therapy or obtained it from convenience stores. Conclusions Substantially reducing the availability of tobacco in communities is likely to require legislative approaches, underpinned by sustained community pressure and support for convenience store owners who are willing to change their business model. ? 2016, BMJ Publishing Group.

Objectives: To describe the methodology for: 1) assessing changes in the prevalence of measured childhood obesity and associated risks between primary and secondary school students in HTV communities, compared with comparison communities; and 2) assessing community-level system changes that influence childhood obesity in HTC and comparison communities. Methods: Twenty-four geographically bounded areas were randomized to either prevention or comparison (2012). A repeat cross-sectional study utilising opt-out consent will collect objectively measured height, weight, waist and self-reported behavioral data among primary [Grade 4 (aged 9-10y) and Grade 6 (aged 11-12y)] and secondary [Grade 8 (aged 13-14y) and Grade 10 (aged 15-16y)] school students (2014 to 2018). Relationships between measured childhood obesity and system causes, as defined in the Foresight obesity systems map, will be assessed using a range of routine and customised data.

Recombinant technology has allowed the production of two drugs, recombinant human chorionic gonadotrophin (rhCG) and recombinant luteinising hormone (rLH), that can be used for the same purpose, to mimic the endogenous luteinising hormone (LH) surge. This allows commercial manufacturers to adjust production according to market requirements and to remove all urinary contaminants, facilitating the safe subcutaneous administration of a compound with less batch-to-batch variation. However, prior to a change in practice, it is necessary to compare the effectiveness of the recombinant drugs to the currently used urinary human chorionic gonadotrophin (uhCG). Objectives: To assess the effects of subcutaneous rhCG and high dose rLH versus uhCG for inducing final oocyte maturation in subfertile women undergoing IVF and ICSI cycles. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Trials Register (April 2015), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (2015, Issue 3), MEDLINE (1946 to April 2015), EMBASE (1980 to April 2015) and PsycINFO (1806 to April 2015) as well as trial registers at ClinicalTrials.gov on 13 May 2015 and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (WHO ICTRP) search portal on 14 May 2015. Selection criteria: Two review authors independently scanned titles and abstracts and selected those that appeared relevant for collection of the full paper. We included randomised controlled trials comparing rhCG and rLH with urinary hCG for final oocyte maturation triggering in IVF and ICSI cycles for treatment of infertility in normogonadotropic women. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently performed assessment for inclusion or exclusion, quality assessment and data extraction. We discussed any discrepancies in the presence of a third author to reach a consensus. The primary review outcomes were ongoing pregnancy/live birth and incidence of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS). Clinical pregnancy, miscarriage rate, number of oocytes retrieved and adverse events were secondary outcomes. We combined data to calculate pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and assessed statistical heterogeneity using the I2 statistic. We evaluated the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods. Main results: We included 18 RCTs involving 2952 participants; 15 compared rhCG with uhCG, and 3 compared rhLH with uhCG. The evidence for different comparisons ranged from very low to high quality: limitations were poor reporting of study methods and imprecision. Pharmaceutical companies funded 9 of the 18 studies, and 5 studies did not clearly report funding source. Ongoing pregnancy/live birth There was no conclusive evidence of a difference between rhCG and uhCG (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.49; 7 RCTs, N = 1136, I2 = 0%, moderate quality evidence) or between rhLH and uhCG (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.78, 2 RCTs, N = 289, I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence) for ongoing pregnancy/live birth rates. OHSS There was no evidence of a difference between rhCG and uhCG in the incidence of OHSS: moderate to severe OHSS (OR 1.76, 95% CI 0.37 to 8.45; 3 RCTs, N = 417, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence), moderate OHSS (OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.27 to 2.27; 1 RCT, N = 243, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence), mild to moderate OHSS (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.42 to 2.38; 2 RCTs, N = 320, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence) or undefined OHSS (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.78; 3 RCTs, N = 495, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence). Likewise, there was no evidence of a difference between rhLH and uhCG in OHSS rates for moderate OHSS (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.39 to 1.69, 2 RCTs, N = 280, I2 = 5%, very low quality evidence). Other adverse events There was no evidence of a difference in miscarriage rates between rhCG and uhCG (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.25; 8 RCTs, N = 1196, I2 = 0%, low quality evidence) or between rhLH and uhCG (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.38 to 2.40; 2 RCTs, N = 289, I2 = 0%, very low quality evidence). For other adverse effects (most commonly injection-site reactions) rhCG was associated with a lower number of adverse events than uhCG (OR 0.52, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.76; 5 RCTS, N = 561; I2 = 67%, moderate quality evidence). However, when we used a random-effects model due to substantial statistical heterogeneity, there was no evidence of a difference between the groups (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.13). Only one study comparing rLH and uhCG reported other adverse events, and it was impossible to draw conclusions. Authors' conclusions: We conclude that there is no evidence of a difference between rhCG or rhLH and uhCG for live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates or rates of OHSS. ? 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,chorionic gonadotropin; gonadorelin agonist; gonadorelin antagonist; luteinizing hormone; recombinant chorionic gonadotropin; recombinant luteinizing hormone; unclassified drug; urinary human chorionic gonadotropin; abdominal pain; backache; comparative effectiveness; diarrhea; drug industry; ectopic pregnancy; endometriosis; fertilization in vitro; human; infertility; injection site reaction; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; live birth; menstruation disorder; missed abortion; oocyte maturation; oocyte retrieval; ovary hyperstimulation; ovary torsion; preeclampsia; pregnancy rate; priority journal; Review; spontaneous abortion; subfertility,2-s2.0-84964345981

The mechanisms related to lipid deposition in the liver, however, remain poorly understood. This study was aimed to investigate the effects of medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) on the lipolysis and expression of lipid-sensing genes in human liver cells with steatosis. A cellular steatosis model, which is suitable to experimentally investigate the impact of fat accumulation in the liver, was established in human normal liver cells (LO2 cells) with a mixture of free fatty acids (oleate/palmitate, 2:1) at 200 m for 24 h incubation. MCFA was found to down-regulate expression of liver X receptor-α, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthase, CD 36 and lipoprotein lipase in this cellular model, and have positive effects on adipose triglyceride lipase and hormone-sensitive lipase. These results suggest that MCFA may reduce lipid accumulation by regulating key lipid-sensing genes in human liver cells with steatosis. ? 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Lipolysis; Liver X receptor-α; Medium-chain fatty acid; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Sterol regulatory element binding protein-1,"fatty acid; messenger RNA; apoptosis; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effects; fatty liver; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; lipid metabolism; liver cell; metabolism; physiology; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Fatty Acids; Fatty Liver; Gene Expression Regulation; Hepatocytes; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; RNA, Messenger",2-s2.0-84978318072

Interventions to support patients to effectively self-manage their condition have the potential to reduce the risk of costly and debilitating complications. The utilisation of mobile phones to deliver self-management support allows for patient-centred care at the frequency and intensity that patients desire from outside the clinic environment. Self-Management Support for Blood Glucose (SMS4BG) is a novel text message-based intervention for supporting people with diabetes to improve self-management behaviours and achieve better glycaemic control and is tailored to individual patient preferences, demographics, clinical characteristics, and culture. This study aims to assess whether SMS4BG can improve glycaemic control in adults with poorly controlled diabetes. This paper outlines the rationale and methods of the trial. Methods/design: A two-arm, parallel, randomised controlled trial will be conducted across New Zealand health districts. One thousand participants will be randomised at a 1:1 ratio to receive SMS4BG, a theoretically based and individually tailored automated text message-based diabetes self-management support programme (intervention) in addition to usual care, or usual care alone (control). The primary outcome is change in glycaemic control (HbA1c) at 9months. Secondary outcomes include glycaemic control at 3 and 6months, self-efficacy, self-care behaviours, diabetes distress, health-related quality of life, perceived social support, and illness perceptions. Cost information and healthcare utilisation will also be collected as well as intervention satisfaction and interaction. Discussion: This study will provide information on the effectiveness of a text message-based self-management support tool for people with diabetes. If found to be effective it has the potential to provide individualised support to people with diabetes across New Zealand (and internationally), thus extending care outside the clinic environment.

Design: Fifty eight participants with estimated fracture risk above that at which guidelines recommend pharmacological intervention were randomised to receive either a standard physician interview or an interview augmented by the presentation of 3-D bone models. Main outcome measures: Participants’ beliefs about osteoporosis and bisphosphonate treatment, initiation of bisphosphonate therapy assessed at two months using self-report and pharmacy dispensing data. Results: Individuals in the 3-D bone model intervention condition were more emotionally affected by osteoporosis immediately after the interview (p?=?.04) and reported a greater understanding of osteoporosis at follow-up (p?=?.04), than the control group. While a greater proportion of the intervention group initiated an oral bisphosphonate regimen (alendronate) (52%) in comparison with the control group (21%), the overall initiation of medication for osteoporosis, including infusion (zoledronate), did not differ significantly (intervention group 62%, control group 45%, p?=?.19). Conclusion: The presentation of 3-D bone models during a medical consultation can modify cognitive and emotional representations relevant to treatment initiation among people with osteoporosis and might facilitate commencement of bisphosphonate treatment. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.",3-D printing; bone models; illness perceptions; risk perceptions; treatment initiation; visualisation,"alendronic acid; bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; imidazole derivative; zoledronic acid; aged; anatomic model; anatomy and histology; attitude to health; bone; controlled study; female; follow up; human; male; osteoporosis; patient attitude; patient education; pilot study; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Alendronate; Bone and Bones; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diphosphonates; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Imidazoles; Male; Models, Anatomic; Osteoporosis; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Patient Education as Topic; Pilot Projects",2-s2.0-84959216107

In aeromedical literature and in the media, these very different events are both described as pilot suicide, but in psychiatry they are considered separate events with distinct risk factors. Methods: Medical databases, internet search engines, and aviation safety databases were searched in a systematic way to obtain relevant cases. Relevant articles were searched for additional references. Results: There were 65 cases of pilot suicide and 6 cases of passengers who jumped from aircraft found. There were also 18 cases of homicide-suicide found involving 732 deaths. Pilots perpetrated 13 homicide-suicide events. Compared to nonaviation samples, a large percentage of pilot suicides in this study were homicide-suicides (17%). Discussion: Homicide-suicide events occur extremely rarely. However, their impact in terms of the proportion of deaths is significant when compared to deaths from accidents. There is evidence of clustering where pilot suicides occur after by media reports of suicide or homicide-suicide. Five of six homicide-suicide events by pilots of commercial airliners occurred after they were left alone in the cockpit. This, along with a sixth incident in which active intervention by a Japan Air crew saved 147 lives, suggests that having two flight members in the cockpit is potentially protective. No single factor was associated with the risk for suicide or homicide-suicide. Factors associated with both events included legal and financial crises, occupational conflict, mental illness, and relationship stressors. Drugs and/or alcohol played a role in almost half of suicides, but not in homicide-suicides. ? by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.",Intentional crash; Mental health; Substance abuse,aircraft; homicide; human; statistics and numerical data; suicide; Aircraft; Homicide; Humans; Suicide,2-s2.0-84974815686

Practice patterns and rates of PD-related infection vary widely across renal units in Australia and New Zealand and are known to vary significantly from guideline recommendations, resulting in PD technique survival rates that are lower than those achieved in many other countries. The aim of this study was to determine if there is an association between current practice and PD-related infection outcomes and to identify the barriers and enablers to good clinical practice. MethodsThis is a multicentre network study involving eight PD units in Australia and New Zealand, with a focus on adherence to guideline recommendations on antimicrobial prophylaxis in PD patients. Current practice was established by asking the PD unit heads to respond to a short survey about practice/protocols/policies and a 'process map' was constructed following a face-to-face interview with the primary PD nurse at each unit. The perceived barriers/enablers to adherence to the relevant guideline recommendations were obtained from the completion of 'cause and effect' diagrams by the nephrologist and PD nurse at each unit. Data on PD-related infections were obtained for the period 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011. ResultsPerceived barriers that may result in reduced adherence to guideline recommendations included lack of knowledge, procedural lapses, lack of a centralized patient database, patients with non-English speaking background, professional concern about antibiotic resistance, medication cost and the inability of nephrologists and infectious diseases staff to reach consensus on unit protocols. The definitions of PD-related infections used by some units varied from those recommended by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, particularly with exit-site infection (ESI). Wide variations were observed in the rates of ESI (0.06-0.53 episodes per patient-year) and peritonitis (0.31-0.86 episodes per patient-year). ConclusionsDespite the existence of strongly evidence-based guideline recommendations, there was wide variation in adherence to these recommendations between PD units which might contribute to PD-related infection rates, which varied widely between units. Although individual patient characteristics may account for some of this variability, inconsistencies in the processes of care to prevent infection in PD patients also play a role. ? 2015 The Author 2015.

KstR is a highly conserved TetR family transcriptional repressor that regulates a large set of genes responsible for cholesterol catabolism. Many genes in this regulon, including kstR, are either induced during infection or are essential for survival of M. tuberculosis in vivo. In this study, we identified two ligands for KstR, both of which are CoA thioester cholesterol metabolites with four intact steroid rings.Ametabolite in which one of the rings was cleaved was not a ligand.Weconfirmed the ligand-protein interactions using intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence and showed that ligand binding strongly inhibited KstR-DNA binding using surface plasmon resonance (IC50 for ligand 25 nM). Crystal structures of the ligandfree form of KstR show variability in the position of the DNA-binding domain. In contrast, structures of KstRligand complexes are highly similar to each other and demonstrate a position of the DNA-binding domain that is unfavorable for DNA binding. Comparison of ligand-bound and ligand-free structures identifies residues involved in ligand specificity and reveals a distinctive mechanism by which the ligand-induced conformational change mediates DNA release. ? 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Amino acids; Bins; Carbon; Cholesterol; Complexation; DNA; Genes; Metabolism; Metabolites; Surface plasmon resonance; Conformational change; DNA binding domain; Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescences; Ligand specificity; Ligand-free structures; Ligand-protein interaction; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Transcriptional repressors; Ligands; cholesterol ester; CoA thioester cholesterol metabolite; protein KstR; repressor protein; unclassified drug; bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; cholesterol; protein binding; repressor protein; Article; bacterial survival; binding affinity; binding site; catabolism; cholesterol catabolism; cholesterol degradation; complex formation; conformational transition; controlled study; crystal structure; DNA binding domain; fluorescence analysis; ligand binding; ligand specificity; lipid degradation; lipid metabolism; metabolic regulation; molecular biology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein DNA binding; protein domain; structure activity relation; structure analysis; surface plasmon resonance; transcription regulation; tryptophan fluorescence; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; protein tertiary structure; X ray crystallography; Bacterial Proteins; Cholesterol; Crystallography, X-Ray; DNA, Bacterial; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Repressor Proteins",2-s2.0-84965164284

This study investigated if this applied to New Zealand women and identified factors that could explain such disparities. Methods This study involved all women who were diagnosed with primary breast cancer in two health regions in New Zealand, covering about 40% of the national population, between June 2000 and May 2013. Patients who received public care for primary treatment, mostly surgical treatment, were compared with those who received private care in terms of demographics, mode of presentation, disease factors, comorbidity index and treatment factors. Cox regression modelling was performed with stepwise adjustments, and hazards of breast cancer specific mortality associated with the type of health care received was assessed. Results Of the 14,468 patients, 8,916 (61.6%) received public care. Compared to patients treated in private care facilities, they were older, more likely to be Maori, Pacifika or Asian and to reside in deprived neighbourhoods and rural areas, and less likely to be diagnosed with early staged cancer and to receive timely cancer treatments. They had a higher risk of mortality from breast cancer (hazard ratio: 1.95; 95% CI: 1.75, 2.17), of which 80% (95% CI: 63%, 100%) was explained by baseline differences, particularly related to ethnicity, stage at diagnosis and type of loco-regional therapy. After controlling for these demographic, disease and treatment factors, the risk of mortality was still 14% higher in the public sector patients. Conclusions Ethnicity, stage at diagnosis and type of loco-regional therapy were the three key contributors to survival disparities between patients treated in public and private health care facilities in New Zealand. The findings underscore the need for more efforts to improve the quality, timeliness and equitability of public cancer care services. ? 2016 Tin Tin et al.

The aim of this study was to assess the use of imaging instruments in gout according to the Outcomes in Rheumatology Clinical Trials (OMERACT) filter to inform the development of imaging as an outcome measure. Methods: A systematic literature search of imaging modalities for gout was undertaken. Articles were assessed by two reviewers to identify imaging domains and summarize information according to the OMERACT filter. Results: The search identified 78 articles (one abstract). Modalities included were conventional radiography (CR) (16 articles), ultrasound (US) (29), conventional computed tomography (CT) (11), dual energy computed tomography (DECT) (20), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (16). Three domains were identified as follows: urate deposition, joint damage, and inflammation. Although sufficient data were available to assess feasibility, validity, and reliability, comprehensive assessment of discrimination was not possible due to the paucity of prospective imaging studies. CR is widely accessible, inexpensive with a validated damage scoring system. US and MRI offer radiation-free methods of evaluating urate deposition, damage and inflammation, but may be limited by accessibility. DECT provides excellent definition of urate deposition and bone damage, but has restricted availability and requires radiation. Conclusions: Imaging methods can detect urate deposition, damage, and inflammation in gout. More than one modality may be required depending on the domains and therapeutic agent of interest. No single imaging method currently fulfils all aspects of the OMERACT filter for any domain. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Gout; Imaging; Outcome measure; Radiology,"uric acid; antigout agent; bone erosion; bone radiography; computer assisted tomography; dual energy computed tomography; echography; gout; human; joint injury; musculoskeletal system parameters; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteitis; priority journal; radiological procedures; Review; scoring system; synovitis; systematic review; urate deposition; diagnostic imaging; gout; outcome assessment; procedures; treatment outcome; x-ray computed tomography; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-84961652519

Methods: The medical records of all adults and young people (> 15 years) with Type 1 diabetes admitted to Auckland City Hospital over a 15-year period from 1997 to 2011 with a primary diagnosis of ketoacidosis were analysed. Patients readmitted with ketoacidosis within 5 years of their index admission were identified and compared with patients without ketoacidosis readmission who were matched for age, gender, ethnicity and duration of diabetes. Results: A total of 268 patients accounted for a total of 412 admissions. In all, 58 patients had more than one admission for diabetic ketoacidosis during this period. Of these, 40 patients readmitted with diabetic ketoacidosis were compared with matched control subjects (n = 40) who had only one admission for diabetic ketoacidosis. The mean ± sd age of the cohort was 31 ± 12 years. The readmission group had more severe diabetic ketoacidosis and poorer glycaemic control. Alcohol abuse was commonly noted in both groups, with insulin dose omission being the main contributor to the development of ketoacidosis. Both groups had high rates of clinic non-attendance. There were no other differences noted between the groups. Conclusion: When patients with recurrent diabetic ketoacidosis were matched for age, duration of diabetes, gender and ethnicity with patients who had only one admission for diabetic ketoacidosis, few differences were noted. This makes designing intervention strategies to reduce readmission with diabetic ketoacidosis difficult. ? 2015 Diabetes UK.",,"insulin; antidiabetic agent; insulin; adult; age distribution; alcohol abuse; Article; controlled study; diabetic ketoacidosis; disease duration; ethnicity; female; glycemic control; hospital readmission; human; major clinical study; male; recurrent disease; risk assessment; sex ratio; smoking; substance abuse; alcoholism; blood; case control study; cohort analysis; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; diabetic ketoacidosis; electronic health record; hospital readmission; medication compliance; middle aged; New Zealand; pathophysiology; public hospital; recurrent disease; retrospective study; risk factor; severity of illness index; young adult; Adult; Alcoholism; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetic Ketoacidosis; Electronic Health Records; Female; Hospitals, Municipal; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Patient Readmission; Recurrence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84961218841

The effects of estrogen in preeclampsia are normally mediated by the classical estrogen receptors. Intriguingly, a novel estrogen receptor, G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30), has been recently found to play an important role in several estrogenic effects. However, the mechanisms by which GPR30 may mediate the development of preeclampsia remain unknown. Method: We observed that the expression of GPR30 in placental trophoblast cells is lower in preeclamptic placentas compared with normotensive controls. We then investigated the role of GPR30 in trophoblast cell invasion by utilizing placental explants and the immortalized human trophoblast cell line (HTR8/SVneo). Results: The selective GPR30 agonist G1 and a general estrogen receptors agonist 17-β-estradiol (E2) both improved trophoblast cells invasion by upregulating MMP9 expression and the PI3K-Akt signaling pathway. This effect was abolished by a selective GPR30 inhibitor G15, implying that GPR30 may be involved in regulating trophoblast invasion, and that down-regulation of this receptor may result in the development of preeclampsia. Conclusion: The present study suggests that GPR30 is a critical regulator of trophoblast cell invasion, and as such may be a potential therapeutic interventional target for preeclampsia and other pregnancy complications resulting from impaired trophoblast invasion. ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",G protein-coupled receptor 30 (GPR30); invasion; preeclampsia; trophoblast cells,"estradiol; estrogen receptor antagonist; G protein coupled receptor 30; G protein coupled receptor 30 agonist G1; G protein coupled receptor 30 inhibitor G15; gelatinase B; hormone receptor stimulating agent; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; unclassified drug; estrogen receptor; G protein coupled receptor; GPER protein, human; adult; Article; cell invasion; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; explant; female; human; human cell; human tissue; placenta; preeclampsia; priority journal; protein expression; receptor down regulation; trophoblast; trophoblastic disease; cell line; metabolism; pathophysiology; physiology; placenta; preeclampsia; pregnancy; Cell Line; Female; Humans; Placenta; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Receptors, Estrogen; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Trophoblasts",2-s2.0-84960429393

These were explored across a range of different services including a face-to-face hospital-based mental health service, a face-to-face school-based counseling service, a telephone counseling service and a new form of counseling using mobile phone text. Interviews were conducted with 63 young people aged 13–18 who had used at least one of these services. A thematic analysis identified that there were common priorities for participants across the different services including their need to keep control; not to have their parents involved; to have a relationship with a counselor which was more like a friendship than a professional relationship; to talk freely and be listened to; and to have the service be accessible and flexible enough to fit around their lives. Text and telephone counseling were seen to be particularly appropriate for meeting some of these needs. Professionals working with young people should consider offering a suite of options for psychological support, allowing young people to balance their different needs and priorities and thus facilitate their engagement. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Adolescence; Counseling; E-counseling; Psychological services; Psychotherapy; Text counseling; Youth culture,,2-s2.0-84959560628

We previously described a family with an autosomal dominant epithelial recurrent erosion dystrophy (ERED). We aimed to identify the underlying genetic cause of ERED in this family and 3 additional ERED families. We sought to characterize the potential function of the candidate genes using the human and zebrafish cornea. Design Case series study of 4 white families with a similar ERED. An experimental study was performed on human and zebrafish tissue to examine the putative biological function of candidate genes. Participants Four ERED families, including 28 affected and 17 unaffected individuals. Methods HumanLinkage-12 arrays (Illumina, San Diego, CA) were used to genotype 17 family members. Next-generation exome sequencing was performed on an uncle-niece pair. Segregation of potential causative mutations was confirmed using Sanger sequencing. Protein expression was determined using immunohistochemistry in human and zebrafish cornea. Gene expression in zebrafish was assessed using whole-mount in situ hybridization. Morpholino-induced transient gene knockdown was performed in zebrafish embryos. Main Outcome Measures Linkage microarray, exome analysis, DNA sequence analysis, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and morpholino-induced genetic knockdown results. Results Linkage microarray analysis identified a candidate region on chromosome chr10:12,576,562-112,763,135, and exploration of exome sequencing data identified 8 putative pathogenic variants in this linkage region. Two variants segregated in 06NZ-TRB1 with ERED: COL17A1 c.3156C→T and DNAJC9 c.334G→A. The COL17A1 c.3156C→T variant segregated in all 4 ERED families. We showed biologically relevant expression of these proteins in human cornea. Both proteins are expressed in the cornea of zebrafish embryos and adults. Zebrafish lacking Col17a1a and Dnajc9 during development show no gross corneal phenotype. Conclusions The COL17A1 c.3156C→T variant is the likely causative mutation in our recurrent corneal erosion families, and its presence in 4 independent families suggests that it is prevalent in ERED. This same COL17A1 c.3156C→T variant recently was identified in a separate pedigree with ERED. Our study expands the phenotypic spectrum of COL17A1 disease from autosomal recessive epidermolysis bullosa to autosomal dominant ERED and identifies COL17A1 as a key protein in maintaining integrity of the corneal epithelium. ? 2016 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology Published by Elsevier Inc.",,"collagen; collagen type 17 alpha 1; Dnajc9 protein; morpholino oligonucleotide; protein; unclassified drug; autoantigen; collagen type 17; DNAJC9 protein, human; heat shock protein 40; microsatellite DNA; nonfibrillar collagen; adolescent; adult; aged; animal tissue; child; clinical article; clinical feature; Conference Paper; controlled study; cornea endothelium; cornea erosion; cornea stroma; DNA sequence; embryo; epithelial recurrent erosion dystrophy; female; gene expression; gene frequency; gene function; gene mutation; gene sequence; gene silencing; genetic association; genetic linkage; genetic screening; genetic variability; genotype; haplotype; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; male; microsatellite marker; middle aged; nonhuman; phenotype; preschool child; priority journal; protein expression; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; upregulation; alternative RNA splicing; animal; confocal microscopy; cornea epithelium; Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary; disease model; gene expression regulation; genetics; high throughput sequencing; mutation; pathology; pedigree; physiology; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; single nucleotide polymorphism; zebra fish; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Alternative Splicing; Animals; Autoantigens; Child; Corneal Dystrophies, Hereditary; Disease Models, Animal; Epithelium, Corneal; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Silencing; Genetic Linkage; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; HSP40 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; In Situ Hybridization; Male; Microsatellite Repeats; Microscopy, Confocal; Middle Aged; Mutation; Non-Fibrillar Collagens; Pedigree; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-84954357822

Currently, the only way to treat cataracts is by surgery. However, with an ageing population, the demand for surgery and the need for cost effective alternative solutions grows exponentially. To reduce the need for cataract surgery, alternative medical therapies to delay cataracts are urgently required. However, given the difficulty in accessing human cataract lenses, investigating the process of cataract formation and testing the efficacy of potential therapies in humans is problematic. Therefore, researchers have looked to create suitable animal models of cataractogenesis to identify therapeutic options. This review will provide an overview of the cataract specific changes previously reported in human cataract lenses, before focussing on the specific changes that occur in age related nuclear (ARN) cataract, the most common form of cataract in humans. This will be followed by a discussion of a range of existing animal cataract models and their respective suitability for mimicking the processes associated with the development of ARN cataract, and therefore their utility as models to test anti-cataract therapies for future use in humans. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Animal models; Lens; Nuclear cataract,"blindness; cataract; cataractogenesis; epidemic; experimental animal; human; morphology; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; visual impairment; animal; cataract; disease model; lens; medical research; pathology; procedures; standards; Animals; Biomedical Research; Cataract; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Lens, Crystalline",2-s2.0-84951737362

Psychological and educational interventions are frequently offered to subfertile couples, but their effectiveness, both in improving mental health and pregnancy rates, is unclear. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions for subfertile couples on psychological and fertility treatment outcomes. Search methods: We searched (from inception to 2 April 2015) the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of Controlled Trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; Issue 2, 2015), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, EBSCO CINAHL, DARE, Web of Science, OpenGrey, LILACS, PubMed, and ongoing trials registers. We handsearched reference lists and contacted experts in the field. Selection criteria: We included published and unpublished randomised controlled trials (RCTs), cluster randomised trials, and cross-over trials (first phase) evaluating the effectiveness of psychological and educational interventions on psychological and fertility treatment outcomes in subfertile couples. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial risk of bias and extracted data. We contacted study authors for additional information. Our primary outcomes were psychological measures (anxiety and depression) and fertility rates (live birth or ongoing pregnancy). We assessed the overall quality of the evidence using GRADE criteria. As we did not consider the included studies to be sufficiently similar to permit meaningful pooling, we summarised the results of the individual studies by presenting the median and interquartile range (IQR) of effects as well as the minimum and maximum values. We calculated standardised mean differences (SMDs) for continuous variables and odds ratios (ORs) for dichotomous outcomes. Main results: We included 39 studies involving 4925 participants undergoing assisted reproductive technology. Studies were heterogeneous with respect to a number of factors, including nature and duration of interventions, participants, and comparator groups. As a result, we judged that pooling results would not result in a clinically meaningful estimate of a treatment effect. There were substantial methodological weaknesses in the studies, all of which were judged to be at high risk of bias for one or more quality assessment domains. There was concern about attrition bias (24 studies), performance bias for psychological outcomes (27 studies) and fertility outcomes (18 studies), and detection bias for psychological outcomes (26 studies). We therefore considered study-specific estimates of intervention effects to be unreliable. Thirty-three studies reported the outcome mental health. Only two studies reported the outcome live birth, and both of these had substantial attrition. One study reported ongoing pregnancy, again with substantial attrition. We have combined live birth and ongoing pregnancy in one outcome. Psychological outcomes Studies utilised a variety of measures of anxiety and depression. In all cases a low score denoted benefit from the intervention. SMDs for anxiety were as follows: psychological interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median (IQR) = -0.30 (-0.84 to 0.00), minimum value -5.13; maximum value 0.84, 17 RCTs, 2042 participants; educational interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median = 0.03, minimum value -0.38; maximum value 0.23, 4 RCTs, 330 participants. SMDs for depression were as follows: psychological interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median (IQR) = -0.45 (-0.68 to -0.08), minimum value -3.01; maximum value 1.23, 12 RCTs, 1160 participants; educational interventions versus attentional control or usual care: median = -0.33, minimum value -0.46; maximum value 0.17, 3 RCTs, 304 participants. Fertility outcomes When psychological interventions were compared with attentional control or usual care, ORs for live birth or ongoing pregnancy ranged from minimum value 1.13 to maximum value 10.05. No studies of educational interventions reported this outcome. Authors' conclusions: The effects of psychological and educational interventions on mental health including distress, and live birth or ongoing pregnancy rates is uncertain due to the very low quality of the evidence. Existing trials of psychological and educational interventions for subfertility were generally poorly designed and executed, resulting in very serious risk of bias and serious inconsistency in study findings. There is a need for studies employing appropriate methodological techniques to investigate the benefits of these treatments for this population. In particular, attentional control groups should be employed, that is groups receiving a treatment that mimics the amount of time and attention received by the treatment group but is not thought to have a specific effect upon the participants, in order to distinguish between therapeutic and non-specific effects of interventions. Where attrition cannot be minimised, appropriate statistical techniques for handling drop-out must be applied. Failure to address these issues in study design has resulted in studies that do not provide a valid basis for answering questions about the effectiveness of these interventions. ? 2016 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"anxiety; anxiety assessment; assessment of humans; Beck Anxiety Inventory; Beck Depression Inventory; body mind well being inventory; cattell anxiety inventory; cognitive therapy; copenhagen multi center psychosocial infertility; coping behavior; daily record keeping; depression; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; distress syndrome; Dyadic Adjustment Scale; female; fertility problem inventory; General Health Questionnaire; genital system disease assessment; group therapy; Hamilton Anxiety Scale; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; Health Promotion Model; hospital admission; human; infertility distress scale; infertility therapy; interpersonal communication; interpersonal therapy; kansas marital satisfaction; live birth; male; marriage; medical information; medical personnel; medically assisted reproduction; mental disease assessment; mental health; music therapy; nursing intervention; outcome assessment; patient counseling; patient satisfaction; Perceived Stress Scale; personnel; Positive and Negative Affect Schedule; positive reappraisal coping intervention; pregnancy; pregnancy rate; Profile of Mood States; psychoeducation; psychosocial care; psychotherapy; quality control; quality of life; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; self help; Self-rating Anxiety Scale; sensitivity analysis; sexual satisfaction; sexual satisfaction questionnaire; Short Form 36; social support; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; subfertility; Symptom Checklist 90; telephone; temperament and character inventory; therapy resistance; treatment outcome; videotape; wellbeing; writing; adult; depression; infertility; mental stress; patient dropout; psychology; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Anxiety; Depression; Female; Humans; Infertility; Live Birth; Male; Patient Dropouts; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Rate; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Stress, Psychological; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84962145359

A γ-glutamyl ligase catalyzes the final steps of the F420 biosynthesis pathway by successive additions of L-glutamate residues to F420-0, producing a poly-γ- glutamate tail. The enzyme responsible for this reaction in archaea (CofE) comprises a single domain and produces F420-2 as the major species. The homologous M. tuberculosis enzyme, FbiB, is a two-domain protein and produces F420 with predominantly 5-7 L-glutamate residues in the poly-γ-glutamate tail. The N-terminal domain of FbiB is homologous to CofE with an annotated γ-glutamyl ligase activity, whereas the C-terminal domain has sequence similarity to an FMN-dependent family of nitroreductase enzymes. Here we demonstrate that full-length FbiB adds multiple L-glutamate residues to F420-0 in vitro to produce F420-5 after 24 h; communication between the two domains is critical for full γ-glutamyl ligase activity. We also present crystal structures of the C-terminal domain of FbiB in apo-, F420-0-, and FMN-bound states, displaying distinct sites for F420-0 and FMN ligands that partially overlap. Finally, we discuss the features of a full-length structural model produced by small angle x-ray scattering and its implications for the role of N- and C-terminal domains in catalysis. ? 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Biochemistry; Catalysis; Enzymes; Plants (botany); Biosynthesis pathways; C-terminal domains; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; N-and C-terminal domains; N-terminal domains; Nitroreductase enzyme; Sequence similarity; Structural modeling; X ray scattering; flavine mononucleotide; flavoprotein; glutamic acid; ligase; protein F420; protein FbiB; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; coenzyme; ligase; poly(gamma-glutamic acid); polyglutamic acid; amino terminal sequence; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; catalysis; controlled study; crystal structure; enzyme activity; in vitro study; ligand binding; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein function; protein purification; protein structure; protein synthesis; RNA translation; structure analysis; X ray crystallography; amino acid sequence; analogs and derivatives; biocatalysis; chemistry; coenzyme; enzyme active site; enzymology; Escherichia coli; gene expression; genetics; metabolism; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; molecular model; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; protein multimerization; protein secondary structure; sequence alignment; Amino Acid Sequence; Bacterial Proteins; Biocatalysis; Catalytic Domain; Cloning, Molecular; Coenzymes; Crystallography, X-Ray; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Ligases; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Polyglutamic Acid; Protein Multimerization; Protein Structure, Secondary; Sequence Alignment",2-s2.0-84964792479

Tandem mass spectrometry incorporating iTRAQ reagents was used as a screen to identify and comparatively quantify the expression of proteins in membrane-enriched samples isolated from primary human melanocytes or three melanoma cells lines. Real-time PCR was used to validate significant hits. Immunohistochemistry was used to validate the expression of proteins of interest in melanocytes in human skin and in melanoma-infiltrated lymph nodes. Publically available databases were examined to assess mRNA expression and correlation to patient outcome in a larger cohort of samples. Finally, preliminary functional studies were carried out using siRNAs to reduce the expression of a protein of interest in primary melanocytes and in a keratinocyte cell line. Two proteins, AHNAK and ANXA2, were significantly downregulated in the melanoma cell lines compared with melanocytes. Downregulation was confirmed in tumor cells in a subset of human melanoma-infiltrated human lymph nodes compared with melanocytes in human skin. Examination of Gene Expression Omnibus database data sets suggests that downregulation of AHNAK mRNA and mutation of the AHNAK gene are common in metastatic melanoma and correlates to a poor outcome. Knockdown of AHNAK in primary melanocytes and in a keratinocyte cell line led to a reduction in detectable cadherin-1. This is the first report that we are aware of which correlates a loss of AHNAK with melanoma and poor patient outcome.

However, little is published about the nature and extent of foot complaints in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). We aimed to explore foot complaints among people with (SLE) and to evaluate the associations between foot pain and self-reported activities of daily living and well-being. Methods: We developed and tested a new 40-item item self-administered questionnaire, using a five-stage development process utilising patient involvement throughout to ensure face and content validity. The self-administered instrument was posted to 406 people with SLE attending adult rheumatology clinics across three health boards in Auckland, New Zealand. The questionnaire enquired about symptoms of foot pain, extra-articular features, anatomical distribution of symptoms according to validated foot-mannequins and the impact of foot symptoms on activities of daily living and well-being. Results: In total, 406 questionnaires were posted, with 131 responses (response rate 32 %). We found 89 % were women, mean (SD) age 51 (15) years, mean (SD) diagnosis 12.5 (11.1) years. Overall, 77 % of those responding to the questionnaire reported foot pain during their SLE, with 45 % reporting current foot pain. All regions of the feet were affected, with the hindfoot (32 %) and ankles (30 %) most troublesome. The most common self-reported extra-articular foot complaints were cold feet, swelling and numbness. Almost two-thirds (61 %) reported foot pain adversely affected their lives; foot pain prevented sleeping in 36 % and had a negative effect on emotions for 33 %. Only 33 % of participants had seen a podiatrist. Significant association was found between foot pain and standing longer than 15 min (p < 0.001), walking (p < 0.001), climbing stairs (p < 0.001) and going shopping (p < 0.001). Pain was the primary symptom to affect quality of life (47/100). Conclusion: Foot complaints in SLE are heterogeneous in nature, and may have a substantial negative impact on patient well-being. Foot complaints need to be addressed to reduce the burden of SLE and our findings support the need for wider access to specific foot care services. ? 2016 Otter et al.",Disability; Foot; Impairment; Pain; Quality of life; Systemic lupus erythematosus,"cross-sectional study; daily life activity; disability; female; foot; human; male; middle aged; pain; pathophysiology; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; systemic lupus erythematosus; visual analog scale; Activities of Daily Living; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disability Evaluation; Female; Foot; Humans; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires; Visual Analog Scale",2-s2.0-84962467929

The growth inhibitory effect of combination treatment with derivative 3 and paclitaxel (tubulin inhibitor), doxorubicin (topoisomerase II inhibitor) or camptothecin (topoisomerase I inhibitor) was evaluated. A preliminary mouse toxicity assay was used to evaluate the pharmacological properties. Results: Addition of the thieno[2,3-b]pyridine derivative 3 to the MDA-MB-231 cells induced G2/M growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest in G2-phase, membrane blebbing and the formation of multinucleated cells. It did not induce DNA damage, mitotic arrest or changes in calcium ion flux. Combination of derivative 3 with paclitaxel showed a high degree of synergy, while combinations with doxorubicin and camptothecin showed only additive effects. A mouse pharmacokinetic study of derivative 3 showed that after intraperitoneal injection of a single does (10 mg/Kg), the Cmax was 0.087 μmol/L and the half-life was 4.11 h. Conclusions: The results are consistent with a mechanism in which thieno[2,3-b]pyridine derivatives interact with PLC isoforms (possibly PLC-δ), which in turn affect the cellular dynamics of tubulin-β, inducing cell cycle arrest in G2-phase. We conclude that these compounds have novelty because of their PLC target and may have utility in combination with mitotic poisons for cancer treatment. ? 2016 Reynisson et al.",3-b]pyridine; Cancer; Cell cycle arrest; Membrane blebbing; Paclitaxel; Phospholipase C; Synergy; Thieno[2,"antibody; calcium ion; camptothecin; doxorubicin; histone H2AX; nsc 768313; paclitaxel; phospholipase C; thieno[2,3 b]pyridine derivative; tubulin; unclassified drug; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; breast cancer cell line; calcium transport; cell cycle arrest; cell structure; DNA damage; drug half life; drug potency; drug potentiation; drug toxicity; enzyme inhibition; flow cytometry; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; IC50; immunocytochemistry; male; maximum plasma concentration; MDA MB 231 cell line; mitosis inhibition; mouse; multinuclear cell; nonhuman; protein expression",2-s2.0-84960371540

However, inconsistencies across studies highlight the need for more objective measures. This paper examines the relationship between sleep duration and objectively measured physical activity, sedentary time and weight status, among a sample of Victorian Primary School children. Methods: A sub-sample of 298 grades four (n = 157) and six (n = 132) Victorian primary school children (aged 9.2-13.2 years) with complete accelerometry and anthropometry data, from 39 schools, were taken from a pilot study of a larger state based cluster randomized control trial in 2013. Data comprised: researcher measured height and weight; accelerometry derived physical activity and sedentary time; and self-reported sleep duration and hypothesised confounding factors (e.g. age, gender and environmental factors). Results: Compared with sufficient sleepers (67 %), those with insufficient sleep (<10 hrs/day) were significantly more likely to be overweight (OR 1.97, 95 % CI:1.11-3.48) or obese (OR 2.43, 95 % CI:1.26-4.71). No association between sleep and objectively measured physical activity levels or sedentary time was found. Conclusion: The strong positive relationship between weight status and sleep deprivation merits further research though PA and sedentary time do not seem to be involved in the relationship. Strategies to improve sleep duration may help obesity prevention initiatives in the future. ? 2016 Morrissey et al.",Accelerometry; ActiGraph; Children; Obesity; Overweight; Physical activity; School children; Sedentary behaviour; Sleep; Sleep duration,accelerometry; adolescent; anthropometry; child; controlled study; exercise; female; human; male; Overweight; Pediatric Obesity; pilot study; randomized controlled trial; risk; risk factor; school; sedentary lifestyle; self report; sleep; sleep deprivation; statistics and numerical data; student; time factor; Victoria; Accelerometry; Adolescent; Anthropometry; Child; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Overweight; Pediatric Obesity; Pilot Projects; Risk; Risk Factors; Schools; Sedentary Lifestyle; Self Report; Sleep; Sleep Deprivation; Students; Time Factors; Victoria,2-s2.0-84960435155

Methods: An online questionnaire was completed by 106 young women taking ET for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. In addition to demographic and medical characteristics, the survey assessed symptom attribution, emotions, and perceptions related to ET. A supplemental survey measuring adherence to ET was completed by 82/106 women. Means, medians, and frequency distributions were calculated for continuous and categorical covariates, respectively. An exploratory analysis evaluated whether adherence was associated with patient characteristics and views. Results: The mean age of respondents was 39 years (range 22-45 years). Two-thirds of women had stage 1 or 2 breast cancer. Women attributed an average of nine symptoms to ET; hot flashes, night sweats, and decreased libido were the most frequently attributed symptoms. Positive emotions toward ET were more common than negative emotions were, although only 48% of respondents believed that ET was essential. Women of higher financial status and those who reported more positive emotions toward ET reported greater adherence with ET. A significant difference in symptom attribution was not detected between less and more adherent respondents. Conclusions: Young women's views regarding ET may play an important role in determining adherence behavior. Given that young women have a higher risk of recurrence, some of which may be attributable to ET non-adherence, further work is needed to confirm these findings and determine whether interventions designed to modify young women's perceptions of ET could promote adherence. ?

Increasing BF or MF concentration led to higher cold paste viscosity and setback viscosity of pasting properties gel adhesiveness, storage modulus (G′) and loss modulus (G?) of dynamic oscillatory rheology, and yield stress (σ0) of flow curve of WF. BF and MF addition decreased peak viscosity and breakdown of pasting, gel hardness, swelling volume, and consistency coefficient (K) of flow curve of WF. Thermal properties of the blends appeared additive of that of individual flour. Nonadditive effects were observed for some property changes in the mixtures, and indicated interactions between flour components.

The mechanisms that promote disease progression from NAFLD to further liver injury are still unclear. We hypothesize that the progression involved ""2nd hit"" is strongly influenced by the type of fatty acids in diets. Flow cytometric analysis showed that medium-chain fatty acid (MCFA) markedly decreased the percentage of late apoptotic and necrotic cells compared with long-chain fatty acid (LCFA), and MCFA inhibited the activities of caspase-3 and -9 in human liver cells with steatosis. Western blot analysis found that the levels of inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1-β, and tumor necrosis factor-α) were substantially reduced by MCFA compared with LCFA. Proteomic analysis further showed that LCFA inhibited the expression of antioxidant enzymes, and increased the expression of proteins associated with oxidative stress. It was found that LCFA (palmitate), not MCFA induced apoptosis, oxidative stress and chronic inflammatory responses in the hepatic cells with steatosis. In conclusion, reasonable selection of dietary fats has potential to translate therapeutically by ameliorating disease progression in patients with NAFLD. ? 2016 Institute of Food Technologists?",Apoptosis; Caspase; Inflammatory responses; Long-chain fatty acid; Medium-chain fatty acid; Oxidative stress,antioxidant; caspase; cytokine; fat intake; fatty acid; apoptosis; complication; diet; diet therapy; disease course; drug effects; fat intake; fatty liver; human; inflammation; liver; liver cell; male; metabolism; necrosis; obesity; oxidative stress; pathology; pharmacology; proteomics; therapeutic use; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Caspases; Cytokines; Diet; Dietary Fats; Disease Progression; Fatty Acids; Fatty Liver; Hepatocytes; Humans; Inflammation; Liver; Male; Necrosis; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Proteomics,2-s2.0-84959274610

This high incidence is generally unexplained although higher rates of obesity and alcohol intake are modifiable risk factors that may be important. M?ori women are less likely to attend mammographic breast screening and are likely to be diagnosed with more advanced disease. This is one of the reasons for the excess mortality. Another factor is differences in the treatment pathway. M?ori women are more likely to experience delay in receiving treatment, are less likely to receive radiotherapy, are more likely to be treated with a mastectomy and are less likely to adhere to long-term adjuvant endocrine therapy. However, genetic factors in M?ori women do not seem to impact significantly on mortality. This review looks at the inequity between M?ori and non-M?ori women and addresses the causes. It proposes ways of reducing inequity through primary prevention, increased participation in breast screening and greater standardisation of the treatment pathway for women newly diagnosed with breast cancer. We believe that health system improvements will decrease barriers to health care participation for M?ori women and suggest that further research into identifying and modifying obstacles within health systems is required. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Breast cancer; Epidemiology; Ethnicity; Maori; New Zealand; Screening; Treatment,"antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; adjuvant chemotherapy; adjuvant radiotherapy; Breast Neoplasms; Caucasian; delayed diagnosis; drinking behavior; early cancer diagnosis; epidemiology; ethnology; female; health care disparity; health disparity; human; incidence; mammography; mastectomy; New Zealand; obesity; Oceanic ancestry group; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; time to treatment; utilization; Alcohol Drinking; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Breast Neoplasms; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Delayed Diagnosis; Early Detection of Cancer; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Health Status Disparities; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Incidence; Mammography; Mastectomy; New Zealand; Obesity; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Risk Factors; Time-to-Treatment",2-s2.0-84959041360

By mid-childhood they had made little developmental progress and remained severely hypotonic and bradykinetic. They developed epilepsy and had problems with autonomic dysfunction and oculogyric crises. They had a number of orthopaedic problems secondary to their hypotonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurotransmitters were initially normal, apart from mildly elevated 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid, and the children did not respond favourably to a trial of levodopa-carbidopa. The youngest died from respiratory complications at 10?years of age. Repeat CSF neurotransmitters in the older sibling at eight years of age showed slightly low homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid levels. Whole-exome sequencing revealed a novel mutation homozygous in both children in the monoamine transporter gene SLC18A2 (p.Pro237His), resulting in brain dopamine-serotonin vesicular transport disease.

This may reflect barriers to communication between professionals, patients and families in the face of lack of consensus about the process. This study aimed to methodically investigate consensus views of how ACP should be explained and carried out with people with dementia. A three-round Delphi study explored views of how and when ACP should be addressed, what should be covered, who should be involved and why rates of ACP are low. Seventeen participants took part comprising family members, old age psychiatrists and policy makers. Thirty-two items reached consensus. The panel agreed on 11 different areas for discussion. They concurred that ACP was best addressed after the person has come to terms with the diagnosis when the individual feels ready to do so. There was a consensus view that the process should be couched in terms of 'certain possibilities'. Consensus items emphasised personal choice and autonomy, while also prioritising the need to discuss financial aspects and to include spouses. There was no consensus that professionals should be involved, although the panel viewed them as carrying some responsibility for low uptake. It is suggested that ACP should include general discussion of values as well as coverage of specific points. Professionals need to offer discussion and information on ACP, but also make clear that the patient has the right to choose whether to pursue ACP or not. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Advance care planning; Alzheimer's disease; Consensus; Delphi technique; Patient care planning,advance care planning; consensus; Delphi study; dementia; doctor patient relation; female; human; male; organization and management; questionnaire; Advance Care Planning; Consensus; Delphi Technique; Dementia; Female; Humans; Male; Physician-Patient Relations; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-84956766049

The PENm is modified based on the current EMG-driven models by decreasing the calculation time and ensuring good prediction accuracy. To ensure the calculation efficiency, the PENm is simplified into two EMG channels around one joint with minimal physiological parameters. In addition, a dynamic computation model is developed to achieve real-time calculation. To ensure the calculation accuracy, patient-specific muscle kinematics information, such as the musculotendon lengths and the muscle moment arms during the entire gait cycle, are employed based on the patient-specific musculoskeletal model. Moreover, an improved force-length-velocity relationship is implemented to generate accurate muscle forces. Gait analysis data including kinematics, ground reaction forces, and raw EMG signals from six adolescents at three different speeds were used to evaluate the PENm. The simulation results show that the PENm has the potential to predict accurate joint moment in real-time. The design of advanced human-robot interaction control strategies and human-inspired gait rehabilitation robots can benefit from the application of the human internal state provided by the PENm. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Gait rehabilitation; Hill-type muscle; Musculoskeletal model; Robot control; Sensitivity analysis,"Biophysics; Design; Electromyography; Gait analysis; Human robot interaction; Kinematics; Machine design; Muscle; Musculoskeletal system; Physiological models; Robots; Sensitivity analysis; Force-length-velocity relationships; Gait rehabilitation; Gait rehabilitation robots; Ground reaction forces; Human-robot interaction control; Musculoskeletal model; Physiological parameters; Robot controls; Patient rehabilitation; activation time constant; Article; computer model; electromyogram; gait; ground reaction force; kinematics; man machine interaction; measurement accuracy; muscle strength; patient specific electromyography driven neuromuscular model; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; torque; velocity; adolescent; biological model; devices; electromyography; female; gait; human; male; personalized medicine; procedures; rehabilitation; robotics; Adolescent; Electromyography; Female; Gait; Humans; Male; Models, Neurological; Precision Medicine; Rehabilitation; Robotics",2-s2.0-84955067691

Design: This team evaluated the evidence to support the timely and appropriate provision of interventions and the most defensible outcome measures during a 4-year voluntary information gathering and assimilation effort, as a basis for the sequencing of an algorithm informed by the data and directed by changes in impairment and chronicity. Outcome measures: The primary outcome was the formulation of a testable app that will be available for minimal user cost. The app is for a smartphone, and the comments of a focus group (audience at a World Confederation for Physical Therapy 2015 presentation, approximate n = 175) during a 30-minute 'Questions and Answers' session were assessed. Results: Analysis of documented, extensive input offered by the audience indicated a highly favourable disposition towards this novel tool, with provision of concrete suggestions prior to launching the final version.

SHELf tested the impact of individual (skill-building), environmental (20 % price reductions), and combined (skill-building + 20 % price reductions) interventions on women's purchasing and consumption of fruits, vegetables, low-calorie carbonated beverages and water. This process evaluation investigated the reach, effectiveness, implementation, and maintenance of the SHELf interventions. Methods: RE-AIM provided a conceptual framework to examine the processes underlying the impact of the interventions using data from participant surveys and objective sales data collected at baseline, post-intervention (3 months) and 6-months post-intervention. Fisher's exact, χ 2 and t-tests assessed differences in quantitative survey responses among groups. Adjusted linear regression examined the impact of self-reported intervention dose on food purchasing and consumption outcomes. Thematic analysis identified key themes within qualitative survey responses. Results: Reach of the SHELf interventions to disadvantaged groups, and beyond study participants themselves, was moderate. Just over one-third of intervention participants indicated that the interventions were effective in changing the way they bought, cooked or consumed food (p &lt; 0.001 compared to control), with no differences among intervention groups. Improvements in purchasing and consumption outcomes were greatest among those who received a higher intervention dose. Most notably, participants who said they accessed price reductions on fruits and vegetables purchased (519 g/week) and consumed (0.5 servings/day) more vegetables. The majority of participants said they accessed (82 %) and appreciated discounts on fruits and vegetables, while there was limited use (40 %) and appreciation of discounts on low-calorie carbonated beverages and water. Overall reported satisfaction with, use, and impact of the skill-building resources was moderate. Maintenance of newly acquired behaviours was limited, with less than half of participants making changes or using study-provided resources during the 6-month post-intervention period. Conclusions: SHELf's reach and perceived effectiveness were moderate. The interventions were more effective among those reporting greater engagement with them (an implementation-related construct). Maintenance of newly acquired behaviours proved challenging.

It is a key component of the immune response against virus-infected and transformed cells and has been implicated in a number of human diseases. Perforin activity can be inhibited by small-molecular-weight compounds, although less is known about their delivery to the site of action. Therefore, in the present study, it was explored if perforin inhibitors could be efficiently and site-selectively delivered firstly into the cytotoxic effector cells and secondly into lytic granules, in which perforin is stored. This was accomplished by designing and synthesizing four prodrugs of perforin inhibitors that could utilize l-type amino acid transporter (LAT1), since activated immune cells are known to over-express LAT1. The results demonstrate that cellular uptake of perforin inhibitors can be increased by LAT1-utilizing prodrugs (into human breast adenocarcinoma cells (MCF-7)). Furthermore, these prodrugs were also able to deliver perforin inhibitors into the cell organelles having lower pH (rat liver lysosomes). Therefore, by using these prodrugs, intracellular mechanisms of perforin inhibitory activity can be studied more thoroughly in future. Moreover, this prodrug approach can be applied for other drugs that would benefit from targeted delivery into cells expressing LAT1, such as cancer. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",L-type amino acid; Perforin inhibitor; Prodrug; Targeted drug delivery; Transporter 1 (LAT1); Transporter-mediated drug delivery,"2 amino 3 [3 [[4 [5 (1 oxo 1,3 dihydroisobenzofuran 5 yl)thiophen 2 yl]phenoxy]carbonyl]phenyl]propanoic acid; 2 amino 3 [3 [[4 [5 (1 oxo 1,3 dihydroisobenzofuran 5 yl)thiophen 2 yl]phenyl]carbonyl]phenyl]propanoic acid; 2 amino 3 [3 [[[4 [5 (1 oxo 1,3 dihydroisobenzofuran 5 yl)thiophen 2 yl]benzyl]oxy]carbonyl]phenyl]propanoix acid; 2 amino 3 [4 [4 [[4 [5 (1 oxo 5 thioxoimidazolidin 4 ylidene)methyl]thiophen 2 yl]phenoxy]carbonyl]phenyl]propanoic acid; 4 [[5 [4 [1 (hydrazonoethyl)phenyl]thiophen 2 yl]methylene] 5 thioxoimidazolidin 2 one; 4 [[5 [4 [1 (hydroxyimino)ethyl]phenyl]thiophen 2 yl]methylene] 5 thioxoimidazolidin 2 one; 5 (1 oxo 1,3 dihydroisobenzofuran 5 yl) thiophene 2 carbaldehyde oxime; 5 [5 (hydrazonomethyl)thiophen 2 yl]isobenzofuran 1 (3h)one; amino acid transporter; levo type amino acid transporter 1; perforin; perforin inhibitor; prodrug; protein inhibitor; unclassified drug; amino acid transporter; perforin; prodrug; animal cell; Article; breast adenocarcinoma; cell organelle; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug synthesis; effector cell; gene overexpression; human; human cell; immunocompetent cell; liver lysosome; nonhuman; pH; physical chemistry; priority journal; rat; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; dose response; drug delivery system; MCF-7 cell line; procedures; Animals; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Large Neutral Amino Acid-Transporter 1; MCF-7 Cells; Perforin; Prodrugs; Rats",2-s2.0-84951117673

Methods: Three-hundred forty-nine 3-year old Asian children from The Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort study underwent AL and CRC measurements with a noncontact ocular biometer and cycloplegic refraction using an autorefractor. The ratio of AL to CRC (AL/CRC) was calculated for all the participants, and subsequently AL, CRC, and AL/CRC were analyzed in relationship to SE. Results: The SE showed better correlation with AL/CRC (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, ρ = -0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.66; -0.49; P&lt;0.001) compared to either AL or CRC alone ([ρ = -0.36; 95% CI: -0.51 to 0.51; P=0.01] and [ρ = 0.05; 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.17; P = 0.34], respectively). Mean AL/CRC was 2.91 ± 0.06 among myopes and decreased to 2.79 ± 0.06 among hyperopes. Axial length to corneal radius of curvature was strongly correlated with SE in myopes (ρ = -0.78; 95% CI: -3.76; -0.79; P =&lt;0.001), but not in emmetropes and hyperopes ([ρ = -0.39; 95% CI: -10.73; -0.57; P = 0.01] and [ρ = -0.18; 95% CI: -17.28; 12.42; P = 0.38], respectively). Linear regression adjusted for gender and ethnicity showed a 0.74diopter shift in SE towards myopia with every 0.1 increase in AL/CRC ratio (P&lt;0.001, r2 = 0.33). Conclusion: The correlation between SE and AL/CRC is stronger than that between AL or CRC alone.

The purpose of this study was to examine the validity of the Short Questionnaire to Assess Health-Enhancing Physical Activity (SQUASH)13 for measuring PAEE among adolescents. Methods: The participants were seventeen adolescents (9 females; Mean age = 17.53; SD = 0.62). Energy expenditure was measured during a 9-day period with doubly labeled water (DLW). The SQUASH was self-administered on the morning of the 10th day and assessed commuting activities, leisure time activities, household activities, and activities at work and school over the previous 9 days. Results: A Bland-Altman plot indicated that the SQUASH underestimated PAEE compared with DLW by a mean difference of 126 kcal·d-1 (95% limits of agreement:-1,207 to 1,459 kcal·d-1), representative of a 10% underestimation. The Spearman rank order correlation coefficient showed there was a significant association between the SQUASH and DLW (r =.50, P =.04), for estimating PAEE. Conclusion: When using a sample of highly active adolescents, the SQUASH is a valid self-report tool for measuring PAEE at the group and individual rank order level. ? 2016 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Measurement; Physical activity energy expenditure; Self-report,"water; adolescent; energy metabolism; female; health status indicator; human; leisure; motor activity; nonparametric test; Ontario; physiology; questionnaire; reproducibility; self report; standards; Adolescent; Energy Metabolism; Female; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Leisure Activities; Motor Activity; Ontario; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Statistics, Nonparametric; Surveys and Questionnaires; Water",2-s2.0-84963720051

As a result, there was an increasing reliance on ageing carers, a lack of permanent and respite accommodation, and reduced employment and educational opportunities. Individuals with disabilities and their families were often isolated and financially disadvantaged. In March 2013, legislation was passed in Australia to establish a National Disability Insurance Scheme, a radical new way of funding disability services. No longer would funding be directed to agencies, but rather to individuals who would make their own plan and select their preferred services and service providers, giving them more control over the services and supports they receive.

Methods Data from patients with poor glycemic control on oral antihyperglycemic drugs who were initiated on a 'basal-plus' regimen for up to 6 months were pooled from four randomized, multicenter studies. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose (PPG), insulin dose and demographics were measured at baseline and end of study. Results 711 patients with a mean age of 59.9 years and a mean duration of diabetes of 11.0 years were included in the analysis population. A 'basal-plus' regimen was associated with significant decreases in HbA1c and PPG at 6 months, an increase in glargine and glulisine doses and small, but statistically significant, changes in body weight and BMI in all patient subsets. The proportion of patients with HbA1c < 7% also increased in all populations studied, while the prevalence of severe hypoglycemia was low and did not significantly differ across patient groups.

However there is less evidence suggesting there is a meaningful association between uric acid and the development of preeclampsia. A total of 877 women with preeclampsia at presentation and 580 normotensive pregnancies were retrospectively recruited from January 2009 to May 2014. In addition, 5556 pregnant women were also prospectively recruited from September 2012 to December 2013. Retrospective serum levels of uric acid were obtained from women with preeclampsia at the time of presentation (n=877), and serum levels of uric acid in the first, second and third trimester were prospectively collected in women who later developed preeclampsia (n=78), as well as those who did not (n=5478). The serum levels of uric acid were significantly increased in women with preeclampsia at presentation from retrospective samples and this increase correlated with the time of onset and the severity of preeclampsia. However, in prospective samples, serum levels of uric acid were not increased in the first and second trimesters in women who later developed preeclampsia compared with those who did not. The serum level of uric acid in the first and second trimesters in women who developed preeclampsia was not different. Our results demonstrate that the serum levels of uric acid were only increased after the presentation of clinical symptoms of preeclampsia.

Initially, we performed an in-depth evaluation of the accuracy of WES variant calling in the pharmacogenes CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 by comparison with MiSeq? amplicon sequencing data (n = 36). This analysis revealed that the concordance rate between WES and MiSeq? was high, achieving 99.60% for variants that were called without exceeding the truth-sensitivity threshold (99%), defined during variant quality score recalibration (VQSR). Beyond this threshold, the proportion of discordant calls increased markedly. Subsequently, we expanded our findings beyond CYP2D6 and CYP2C19 to include more genes genotyped by the iPLEX? ADME PGx Panel in the subset of twelve samples. WES performed well, agreeing with the genotyping panel in approximately 99% of the selected pass-filter variant calls. Overall, our results have demonstrated WES to be a promising approach for pharmacogenomic profiling, with an estimated error rate of lower than 1%. Quality filters, particularly VQSR, are important for reducing the number of false variants.

Methods: We used two different comparison groups, all patients who tested negative for influenza and only those patients who tested negative for influenza and had a non-influenza respiratory virus detected, to calculate the vaccine effectiveness in a test negative study design. Estimates were made separately for general practice outpatient consultations and hospitalised patients, stratified by age group and by influenza type and subtype. Vaccine status was confirmed by electronic record for general practice patients and all respiratory viruses were detected by real time polymerase chain reaction. Results: 1039 hospitalised and 1154 general practice outpatient consultations met all the study inclusion criteria and had a respiratory sample tested for influenza and other respiratory viruses. Compared to general practice patients, hospitalised patients were more likely to be very young or very old, to be Maori or Pacific Islander, to have a low income and to suffer from chronic disease. Vaccine effectiveness (VE) adjusted for age and other participant characteristics using all influenza negative controls was 42% (95% CI: 16 to 60%) for hospitalised and 56% (95% CI: 35 to 70%) for general practice patients. The vaccine appeared to be most effective against the influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 strain with an adjusted VE of 62% (95% CI:38 to 77%) for hospitalised and 59% (95% CI:36 to 74%) for general practice patients, using influenza virus negative controls. Similar results found when patients testing positive for a non-influenza respiratory virus were used as the control group. Conclusion: This study contributes to validation of the test negative design and confirms that inactivated influenza vaccines continue to provide modest but significant protection against laboratory-confirmed influenza. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Immunisation; Influenza vaccine; Test case negative design; Vaccination; Vaccine effectiveness,"influenza vaccine; inactivated vaccine; influenza vaccine; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; chronic disease; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; hospital patient; human; infant; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); lowest income group; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; nonhuman; Pacific Islander; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; respiratory virus; urban area; virus detection; virus strain; comparative study; control group; general practice; hospitalization; immunology; Influenza, Human; middle aged; preschool child; Respiratory Tract Diseases; sentinel surveillance; statistics and numerical data; vaccination; very elderly; virology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Control Groups; Female; General Practice; Hospitalization; Humans; Infant; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Sentinel Surveillance; Vaccination; Vaccines, Inactivated; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84952990772

Many prisoners with SMI do not receive care. Screening tools have been developed but better detection has not translated to higher rates of treatment. In New Zealand a Prison Model of Care (PMOC) was developed by forensic mental health and correctional services to address this challenge. The PMOC broadened triggers for referrals to mental health teams. Referrals were triaged by mental health nurses leading to multidisciplinary team assessment within specified timeframes. This pathway for screening, referral and assessment was introduced within existing resources. Method: The PMOC was implemented across four prisons. An AB research design was used to explore the extent to which mentally ill prisoners were referred to and accepted by prison in-reach mental health teams and to determine the proportion of prison population receiving specialist mental health care. Results: The number of prisoners in the study in the year before the PMOC (n = 19,349) was similar to the year after (n = 19,421). 24.6 % of prisoners were screened as per the PMOC in the post period. Referrals increased from 491 to 734 in the post period (Z = -7.23, p < 0.0001). A greater number of triage assessments occurred after the introduction of the PMOC (pre = 458; post = 613, Z = 4.74, p < 0.0001) leading to a significant increase in the numbers accepted onto in-reach caseloads (pre = 338; post = 426, Z = 3.16, p < 0.01). Numbers of triage assessments completed within specified time frames showed no statistically significant difference before or after implementation. The proportion of prison population on in-reach caseloads increased from 5.6 % in the pre period to 7.0 % in the year post implementation while diagnostic patterns did not change, indicating more prisoners with SMI were identified and engaged in treatment. Conclusions: The PMOC led to increased prisoner numbers across screening, referral, treatment and engagement. Gains were achieved without extra resources by consistent processes and improved clarity of professional roles and tasks. The PMOC described a more effective pathway to specialist care for people with SMI entering prison. ? 2016 Pillai et al.",Mental health in-reach services; Mental health screening tool; Offender; Prisoner mental health,Article; clinical assessment; controlled study; forensic mental health; health care concepts; health care planning; human; major clinical study; male; mass screening; mental disease; mental health; mental health care; mental health in reach caseload; mental health nurse; nurse; patient care; patient referral; prison model of care; prisoner; screening test; serious mental illness; specialist mental health care; study design; treatment engagement; triage assessment; emergency health service; female; Mental Disorders; mental health service; New Zealand; organization and management; patient care; psychology; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; New Zealand; Patient Care Team; Prisoners; Referral and Consultation; Triage,2-s2.0-84954217529

Univariate analysis showed that fallers had significantly longer mean disease duration, more co-morbid conditions, an increase in lower limb tender joints, higher midfoot peak plantar pressures and were more likely to have a history of vascular disease than non-fallers. Fallers also reported greater difficulty with activities of daily living, increased fear of falling and greater self-reported foot impairment. Logistic regression analysis revealed that increased midfoot peak plantar pressures (odds ratio (OR) 1.12 [for each 20 kPa increase], 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.00-1.25), self-reported foot impairment (OR 1.17 [for each three point increase], 95 % CI 1.05-1.31) and history of vascular disease (OR 3.22, 95 % CI 1.17-8.88) were independently associated with a fall in the preceding 12 months. Conclusions: Elevated midfoot peak plantar pressures, self-reported foot impairment and vascular disease are associated with falls in people with RA. Assessment of foot deformity, foot function and self-reported foot impairment may be of benefit when considering falls prevention strategies in people with RA.

The effects on mortality and morbidity of extreme heat in Tibet have been examined in previous studies; no heat adaptation initiatives have yet been implemented. We estimated heat vulnerability of urban and rural populations in 73 Tibetan counties and identified potential areas for public health intervention and further research. Methods: According to data availability and vulnerability factors identified previously in Tibet and elsewhere, we selected 10 variables related to advanced age, low income, illiteracy, physical and mental disability, small living spaces and living alone. We separately created and mapped county-level cumulative heat vulnerability indices for urban and rural residents by summing up factor scores produced by a principal components analysis (PCA). Results: For both study populations, PCA yielded four factors with similar structure. The components for rural and urban residents explained 76.5 % and 77.7 % respectively of the variability in the original vulnerability variables. We found spatial variability of heat vulnerability across counties, with generally higher vulnerability in high-altitude counties. Although we observed similar median values and ranges of the cumulative heat vulnerability index values among urban and rural residents overall, the pattern varied strongly from one county to another. Conclusions: We have developed a measure of population vulnerability to high temperatures in Tibet. These are preliminary findings, but they may assist targeted adaptation plans in response to future rapid warming in Tibet. ? 2016 Bai et al.",Adaption; Climate change; Heat; Rural; Tibet; Urban; Vulnerability,adaptation; climate change; global warming; heat transfer; high temperature; mental health; morbidity; mortality; population structure; public health; rural area; spatial variation; urban area; vulnerability; adult; aging; altitude; Article; China; climate change; disability; education; geographic distribution; heat acclimatization; heat vulnerability; household; human; income; principal component analysis; priority journal; risk factor; rural population; urban population; vulnerable population; adverse effects; epidemiology; greenhouse effect; health status; heat; rural population; season; statistics and numerical data; Tibet; urban population; China; Xizang; Extreme Heat; Global Warming; Health Status; Hot Temperature; Humans; Rural Population; Seasons; Tibet; Urban Population,2-s2.0-84954369229

Trophoblasts are placenta-specific epithelial cells that maximize nutrient exchange. All trophoblast lineages are thought to arise from a population of trophoblast stem cells (TSCs). However, whilst the isolation of murine TSC has led to an explosion in understanding murine placentation, the isolation of an analogous human TSC has proved more difficult. Consequently, alternative methods of studying human trophoblast lineage development have been employed, including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) and transformed cell lines; but what do these proxy models tell us about what is happening during early placental development? OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: In this systematic review, we evaluate current approaches to understanding human trophoblast lineage development in order to collate and refine these models and inform future approaches aimed at establishing human TSC lines. SEARCH METHODS: To ensure all relevant articles were analysed, an unfiltered search of Pubmed, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science was conducted for 25 key terms on the 13th May 2016. In total, 47 313 articles were retrieved and manually filtered based on non-human, non-English, non-full text, non-original article and off-topic subject matter. This resulted in a total of 71 articles deemed relevant for review in this article. OUTCOMES: Candidate human TSC populations have been identified in, and isolated from, both the chorionic membrane and villous tissue of the placenta, but further investigation is required to validate these as 'true' human TSCs. Isolating human TSCs from blastocyst trophectoderm has not been successful in humans as it was in mice, although recently the first reported TSC line (USFB6) was isolated from an eight-cell morula. In lieu of human TSC lines, trophoblast-like cells have been induced to differentiate from hESCs and iPS. However, differentiation in these model systems is difficult to control, culture conditions employed are highly variable, and the extent to which they accurately convey the biology of 'true' human TSCs remains unclear, particularly as a consensus has not been met among the scientific community regarding which characteristics a human TSC must possess. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Human TSC models have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of trophoblast differentiation, allowing us to make significant gains in understanding the underlying pathology of pregnancy disorders and to test potential therapeutic interventions on cell function in vitro. In order to do this, a collaborative effort is required to establish the criteria that define a human TSC to confirm the presence of human TSCs in both primary isolates and to determine how accurately trophoblast-like cells derived from current model systems reflect trophoblast from primary tissue. The in vitro systems currently used to model early trophoblast lineage formation have provided insights into early human placental formation but it is unclear whether these trophoblast-like cells are truly representative of primary human trophoblast. Consequently, continued refinement of current models, and standardization of culture protocols is essential to aid our ability to identify, isolate and propagate 'true' human TSCs from primary tissue. ?

14q24.1, close to RAD51B, has been associated with breast cancer: rs999737 and rs2588809 with the risk of female breast cancer and rs1314913 with the risk of male breast cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of RAD51B variants in breast cancer predisposition, particularly in the context of familial breast cancer in Finland. We sequenced the coding region of RAD51B in 168 Finnish breast cancer patients from the Helsinki region for identification of possible recurrent founder mutations. In addition, we studied the known rs999737, rs2588809, and rs1314913 SNPs and RAD51B haplotypes in 44,791 breast cancer cases and 43,583 controls from 40 studies participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) that were genotyped on a custom chip (iCOGS). We identified one putatively pathogenic missense mutation c.541C&gt;T among the Finnish cancer patients and subsequently genotyped the mutation in additional breast cancer cases (n = 5259) and population controls (n = 3586) from Finland and Belarus. No significant association with breast cancer risk was seen in the meta-analysis of the Finnish datasets or in the large BCAC dataset. The association with previously identified risk variants rs999737, rs2588809, and rs1314913 was replicated among all breast cancer cases and also among familial cases in the BCAC dataset. The most significant association was observed for the haplotype carrying the risk-alleles of all the three SNPs both among all cases (odds ratio (OR): 1.15, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.11-1.19, P = 8.88 × 10-16) and among familial cases (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.16-1.32, P = 6.19 × 10-11), compared to the haplotype with the respective protective alleles. Our results suggest that loss-of-function mutations in RAD51B are rare, but common variation at the RAD51B region is significantly associated with familial breast cancer risk.",,"cytosine; thymine; DNA binding protein; RAD51B protein, human; allele; Article; breast cancer; cancer susceptibility; controlled study; female; Finland; Finn (citizen); gene; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic predisposition; genetic variability; genotype; haplotype; hereditary tumor syndrome; heterozygote; human; major clinical study; male; meta analysis (topic); missense mutation; population based case control study; RAD51B gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; Breast Neoplasms; genetics; genotyping technique; middle aged; physiology; Breast Neoplasms; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Finland; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotyping Techniques; Haplotypes; Heterozygote; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation, Missense; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-85023753787

Few studies report changes in hospitalisation rates before and after entry into LTC. This study compares hospitalisation rates 1 year before and after LTC entry.Methods: the Older Persons' Ability Level (OPAL) study was a 2008 census-type survey of LTC facilities in Auckland, New Zealand. OPAL resident hospital admissions and deaths were obtained from routinely collected national databases.Results: all 2,244 residents (66% = female) who entered LTC within 12 months prior to OPAL were included. There were 3,363 hospitalisations, 2,424 in 12 months before and 939 in 12 months after entry, and 364 deaths. In the 6 to 12 months before LTC entry, the hospitalisation rate/100 person-years was 67.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 62.5-72.1). Weekly rates then rose steeply to over 450/100 person-years in the 6 months immediately before LTC entry. In the 6 months after LTC entry, the rate fell to 49.1 (CI 44.9-53.3; RR 0.73 (CI 0.65-0.82, P < 0.0001)) and decreased further 6 to 12 months after entry to 41.1 (CI 37.1-45.1; rate ratio [RR] 0.61 (CI 0.54-0.69, P < 0.0001)).Conclusions: increased hospitalisations a few months before LTC entry suggest functional and medical instability precipitates LTC entry. New residents utilise hospital beds less frequently than when at home before that unstable period. Further research is needed to determine effective interventions to avoid some hospitalisations and possibly also LTC entry. ? The Author 2016.

SUMMARY ANSWER: Many combinations of numerator and denominator are in use, and are often employed in a manner that compromises the validity of the study. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: The choice of numerator and denominator governs the meaning, relevance and statistical integrity of a study's results. RCTs only provide reliable evidence when outcomes are assessed in the cohort of randomised participants, rather than in the subgroup of patients who completed treatment. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Review of outcome measures reported in 142 IVF RCTs published in 2013 or 2014. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Trials were identified by searching the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Specialised Register. English-language publications of RCTs reporting clinical or preclinical outcomes in peer-reviewed journals in the period 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2014 were eligible. Reported numerators and denominators were extracted. Where they were reported, we checked to see if live birth rates were calculated correctly using the entire randomised cohort or a later denominator. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Over 800 combinations of numerator and denominator were identified (613 in no more than one study). No single outcome measure appeared in the majority of trials. Only 22 (43%) studies reporting live birth presented a calculation including all randomised participants or only excluding protocol violators. A variety of definitions were used for key clinical numerators: for example, a consensus regarding what should constitute an ongoing pregnancy does not appear to exist at present. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Several of the included articles may have been secondary publications. Our categorisation scheme was essentially arbitrary, so the frequencies we present should be interpreted with this in mind. The analysis of live birth denominators was post hoc. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: There is massive diversity in numerator and denominator selection in IVF trials due to its multistage nature, and this causes methodological frailty in the evidence base. The twin spectres of outcome reporting bias and analysis of non-randomised comparisons do not appear to be widely recognised. Initiatives to standardise outcome reporting, such as requiring all effectiveness studies to report live birth or cumulative live birth, are welcome. However, there is a need to recognise that early outcomes of treatment, such as stimulation response or embryo quality, may be appropriate choices of primary outcome for early phase studies. ?

Determining how these genetic variants influence growth is important, but most are noncoding, and there is little understanding of how these variants contribute to adult height. To determine the mechanisms by which human variation contributes to growth, we combined spatial genomic connectivity (high-throughput conformation capture) with functional (gene expression, expression Quantitative Trait Loci) data to determine how non-genic loci associated with infant length, pubertal and adult height and contribute to gene regulatory networks. This approach identified intergenic single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) ~85 kb upstream of FBXW11 that spatially connect with distant loci. These regulatory connections are reinforced by evidence of SNP-enhancer effects and altered expression in genes influencing the action of human growth hormone. Functional assays provided evidence for enhancer activity of the intergenic region near FBXW11 that harbors SNP rs12153391, which is associated with an expression Quantitative Trait Loci. Our results suggest that variants in this locus have genome-wide effects as key modifiers of growth (both overgrowth and short stature) acting through a regulatory network.We believe that the genes and pathways connected with this regulatory network are potential targets that could be investigated for diagnostic, prenatal and carrier testing for growth disorders. Finally, the regulatory networks we generated illustrate the power of using existing datasets to interrogate the contribution of intergenic SNPs to common syndromes/diseases. ? The Author 2016.

This study characterizes the physical and biological properties of a novel collagen-based scaffold. Transparency, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to analyze the structure of the scaffold, synthesized using rat tail collagen I. Water content was determined. The tensile strength was assessed using a micro-mechanical analyzer. In vitro biocompatibility was assessed by culturing the scaffold with epithelial or keratocyte spheres. The mean scaffold transmittance was 0.72 at 358 nm, 0.88 at 570 nm, and 0.92 at 900 nm. OCT imaging confirmed that the scaffold maintained a corneal shape, with a central thickness of 502 mm and a reflectivity profile comparable to that of a normal human cornea. SEM of the scaffold revealed multiple lamellae on cross section. The mean water content was 88.7% -0.7%. Ultimate tensile strength for the noncross-linked scaffold was 1.23-0.27 MPa compared with 2.21-0.70 MPa for the cross-linked scaffold (human corneal anterior stroma 1.53-0.86 MPa) at a strain rate of 0.5%/s. Epithelial cells migrated over the scaffold to confluence. Keratocytes populated the scaffold and maintained a lamellar arrangement. The properties of this novel scaffold suggest that it has potential to be developed into a corneal tissue substitute for human transplantation. ?

The Neighbourhoods for Active Kids (NfAK) study examines how neighbourhood built environments are associated with the independent mobility, active travel, physical activity and neighbourhood experiences of children aged 9-12 years in primary and intermediate schools across Auckland, New Zealand's largest city. Methods and analysis: Child-specific indices of walkability, destination accessibility and traffic exposure will be constructed to measure the built environment in 8 neighbourhoods in Auckland. Interactive onlinemapping software will be used to measure children's independent mobility and transport mode to destinations and to derive measures of neighbourhood use and perceptions. Physical activity will be measured using 7-day accelerometry. Height, weight and waist circumference will be objectively measured. Parent telephone interviews will collect sociodemographic information and parent neighbourhood perceptions. Interviews with school representative will capture supports and barriers for healthy activity and nutrition behaviours at the school level. Multilevel modelling approaches will be used to understand how differing built environment variables are associated with activity, neighbourhood experiences and health outcomes. Discussion: We anticipate that children who reside in neighbourhoods considered highly walkable will be more physically active, accumulate more independent mobility and active travel, and be more likely to have a healthy body size. This research is timely as cities throughout New Zealand develop and implement plans to improve the liveability of intensifying urban neighbourhoods. Results will be disseminated to participants, local government agencies and through conventional academic avenues. ? 2016 BMJ Publishing Group.

This study explores diversity in the experience of antidepressant users. Methods: One thousand seven hundred forty-seven New Zealand antidepressant users responded to an openended question about their experience of antidepressants. This was analysed using content and thematic analysis. Results: There was considerable diversity in participants' responses including positive (54 %), negative (16 %) and mixed (28 %) experiences with antidepressants. Those with positive experiences saw antidepressants as a necessary treatment for a 'disease', a life saver, a way of meeting social obligations, dealing with difficult circumstances or a stepping stone to further help. Negative themes described antidepressants as being ineffective, having unbearable side effects, undermining emotional authenticity, masking real problems and reducing the experience of control. Mixed experience themes showed how participants weighed up the unpleasant side effects against the benefits, felt calmer but less like themselves, struggled to find the one or dosage and felt stuck with continuing on antidepressants when they wished to stop. Conclusions: Mental health professions need to recognize that antidepressants are not a 'one size fits all' solution. ? 2016 Gibson et al.",Antidepressants; Depression; Medication use; Patient experiences,antidepressant agent; antidepressant agent; Article; attitude to illness; content analysis; drug efficacy; drug indication; drug safety; drug use; emotionality; human; major clinical study; personal experience; qualitative analysis; questionnaire; thematic analysis; unspecified side effect; adult; attitude to health; Depressive Disorder; evaluation study; female; male; middle aged; New Zealand; patient satisfaction; psychology; Adult; Antidepressive Agents; Attitude to Health; Depressive Disorder; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Patient Satisfaction; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85007490218

In arguing this, we attempt to understand the particular effects of certain models on practice and students. We draw on the theoretical concepts of Deleuze, in particular his notion of 'striated' space to analyze SPARK-PE, HOPE, and Sport Education.

Design/methodology/approach - A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of IPS programs. In total, 30 studies provided information characterizing 69 cohorts and 8,392 participants. Predictive validity was assessed by a precision and negative prediction analysis and by multivariate analysis of deviance. Findings: Fidelity scores on the IPS-15 scale of 60 or less accurately predicted poor outcomes, defined as 43 percent or less of participants commencing employment, in 100 percent of cohorts. Among cohorts with IPS-15 fidelity scores of 61-75, 63 percent attained good employment outcomes defined as 44 percent or more commencing employment. A similar pattern emerged from the precision analysis of the smaller sample of IPS-25 cohorts. Multivariate analysis of deviance for studies using the IPS-15 scale examined six cohort characteristics. Following adjustment for fidelity score, only fidelity score (? = 15.31, df= 1, p&lt; 0.001) and author group (x2 = 35.01, df=17, p = 0.01) representing an aspect of cohort heterogeneity, remained associated with commencing employment. Research limitations/implications: This study provides evidence of moderate, yet important, predictive validity of the IPS-15 scale across diverse international and research contexts. The smaller sample of IPS-25 studies limited the analysis that could be conducted. Practical implications: Program implementation leaders are encouraged to first focus on attaining good fidelity, then supplement fidelity monitoring with tracking the percentage of new clients who obtain a competitive job employment over a pre-defined period of time. Originality/value: The evidence indicates that good fidelity may be necessary but not sufficient for good competitive employment outcomes. ?

Methods: Data on 1,127 women with endometrial cancer including body mass index (BMI), age at diagnosis, parity, menopausal status and cancer subtype were collected from the largest obstetrics & gynaecology hospital in China and analysed. Results: After adjusting for age and parity, the odds for developing endometrial cancer in overweight or obese perimenopausal women was significantly higher than that in women with normal weight (OR=2.6 with 95%CI:1.9-3.5, and OR=3.5 with 95%CI: 2.2-5.4, respectively). The odds of developing endometrial cancer in overweight postmenopausal women were significantly higher than that in women who were normal weight (OR=2.4 with 95%CI: 1.8-3.1), however this was not the case for obese postmenopausal women. We further found that BMI, menopausal status, age and parity were not associated with subtypes of endometrial cancer. Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that obesity is positively associated with the incidence of developing endometrial cancer in Chinese women, with more significant effects in perimenopausal women. ?

Using a rat model, we aimed to assess the effects of supplementation with oxidized fish oil during pregnancy in mothers and offspring, focusing on newborn viability and maternal insulin sensitivity. Female rats were allocated to a control or high-fat diet and then mated. These rats were subsequently randomized to receive a daily gavage treatment of 1 ml of unoxidized fish oil, a highly oxidized fish oil, or control (water) throughout pregnancy. At birth, the gavage treatment was stopped, but the same maternal diets were fed ad libitum throughout lactation. Supplementation with oxidized fish oil during pregnancy had a marked adverse effect on newborn survival at day 2, leading to much greater odds of mortality than in the control (odds ratio 8.26) and unoxidized fish oil (odds ratio 13.70) groups. In addition, maternal intake of oxidized fish oil during pregnancy led to increased insulin resistance at the time of weaning (3 wks after exposure) compared with control dams (HOMA-IR 2.64 vs. 1.42; P = 0.044). These data show that the consumption of oxidized fish oil is harmful in rat pregnancy, with deleterious effects in both mothers and offspring. ? 2016 the American Physiological Society.",Dams; Lipid peroxides; Lipids; n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; Omega-3; Pups,"fish oil; insulin; fish oil; animal experiment; Article; birth; controlled study; diet supplementation; female; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lactation; lipid diet; maternal nutrition; newborn mortality; nonhuman; pregnancy; priority journal; progeny; rat; weaning; adverse effects; animal; chemically induced; dietary supplement; human; hyperglycemia; infant; infant mortality; newborn; oxidation reduction reaction; pathophysiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Dietary Supplements; Female; Fish Oils; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Infant; Infant Mortality; Insulin Resistance; Oxidation-Reduction; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",2-s2.0-84986538369

Changes in circadian rhythms such as bright light exposure may affect female reproductive physiology. Night shift work is associated with higher risks of developing gynaecological cancers. In addition, the season of birth is also suggested as an important environmental risk factor for developing gynaecological cancers. Melatonin may play an important role in this association as a marker of circadian rhythms. Serum from 96 women with ovarian cancer and 40 healthy women were collected and the level of melatonin was measured. In addition 277 women with ovarian cancer and 1076 controls were retrospectively collected for season of birth analysis over seven years. The serum levels of melatonin were significantly lower in women with ovarian cancer compared with healthy women (p < 0.05). However there was no difference in melatonin levels in perimenopausal and postmenopausal patients. In addition, there is no statistically significant difference in seasonal distribution of birth between ovarian cancer patients and the control group. The melatonin levels in ovarian cancer patients and controls were not associated with the season of birth. Our results demonstrate the lower serum levels of melatonin in ovarian cancer patients which may contribute to the pathogenesis of ovarian cancer. The incidence of ovarian cancer was not associated with the season of birth. The serum levels of melatonin do not appear to be associated with season of birth in ovarian cancer patients. ?

GDM is defined as a carbohydrate intolerance resulting in hyperglycaemia or any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first recognition during pregnancy from 24 weeks' gestation onwards and which resolves following the birth of the baby. Rates for GDM can be as high as 25% depending on the population and diagnostic criteria used and rates are increasing globally. Risk factors associated with GDM include advanced maternal age, obesity, ethnicity, family history of diabetes, and a previous history of GDM, macrosomia or unexplained stillbirth. There is wide variation internationally in glycaemic treatment target recommendations for women with GDM that are based on consensus rather than high-quality trials.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effect of different intensities of glycaemic control in pregnant women with GDM on maternal and infant health outcomes.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Pregancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (31 January 2016), ClinicalTrials.gov, the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) (1 February 2016) and reference lists of the retrieved studies.SELECTION CRITERIA: We included one randomised controlled trial. Cluster-randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials were eligible for inclusion.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used the methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions for carrying out data collection, assessing study quality and analysing results. Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility for inclusion, evaluated methodological quality and extracted data for the one included study. We sought additional information from one trial author but had no response. We assessed the quality of evidence for selected outcomes using the GRADE approach.MAIN RESULTS: We included one Canadian trial of 180 women, recruited between 20 to 32 weeks' gestation, who had been diagnosed with GDM. Data from 171 of the 180 women were published as a conference abstract and no full report has been identified. The overall risk of bias of the single included study was judged to be unclear.The included trial did not report on any of this review's primary outcomes. For the mother, these were hypertension disorders of pregnancy or subsequent development of type 2 diabetes. For the infant, our primary outcomes were (perinatal (fetal and neonatal) mortality; large-for-gestational age; composite of death or severe morbidity or later childhood neurosensory disability).The trial did report data relating to some of this review's secondary outcomes. There was no clear difference in caesarean section rates for women assigned to using strict glycaemic targets (pre-prandial 5.0 mmol/L (90 mg/L) and at one-hour postprandial 6.7 mmol/L (120 mg/dL)) (28/85, 33%) when compared with women assigned to using liberal glycaemic targets (pre-prandial 5.8 mmol/L (103 mg/dL) and at one-hour postprandial 7.8 mmol/L (140 mg/dL)) (21/86, 24%) (risk ratio (RR) 1.35, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83 to 2.18, one trial, 171 women; very low quality). Using the GRADE approach, we found the quality of the evidence to bevery low for caesarean section due to poor reporting of risk of bias, imprecision and publication bias. Strict glycaemic targets were associated with an increase in the use of pharmacological therapy (identified as the use of insulin in this study) (33/85; 39%) compared with liberal glycaemic targets (18/86; 21%) (RR 1.85, 95% CI 1.14 to 3.03; one trial, 171 women). CIs are wide suggesting imprecision and caution is required when interpreting the data. No other secondary maternal outcome data relevant to this review were reported. For the infant, there were no clear differences between the groups of women receiving strict and liberal glycaemic targets for macrosomia (birthweight greater than 4000 g) (RR 1.35, 95% CI 0.31 to 5.85, one trial, 171 babies); small-for-gestational age (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.48 to 2.63, one trial, 171 babies); birthweight (mean difference (MD) -92.00 g, 95% CI -241.97 to 57.97, one trial, 171 babies) or gestational age (MD -0.30 weeks, 95% CI -0.73 to 0.13, one trial, 171 babies). Adverse effects data were not reported. No other secondary neonatal outcomes relevant to this review were reported.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This review is based on a single study (involving 180 women) with an unclear risk of bias. The trial (which was only reported in a conference abstract) did not provide data for any of this review's primary outcomes but did provide data for a limited number of our secondary outcomes. There is insufficient evidence to guide clinical practice for targets for glycaemic control for women with GDM to minimise adverse effects on maternal and fetal health. Glycaemic target recommendations from international professional organisations for maternal glycaemic control vary widely and are reliant on consensus given the lack of high-quality evidence.Further high-quality trials are needed, and these should compare different glycaemic targets for guiding treatment of women with GDM, assess both short-term and long-term health outcomes for women and their babies, include women's experiences and assess health services costs.

Aim: We sought to determine the prognostic importance of anaemia in a large multinational pooled dataset of prospectively enrolled HF patients, with the specific aim to determine the prognostic role of anaemia in HF with preserved and reduced ejection fraction (HF-PEF and HF-REF, respectively). Design: Individual person data meta-analysis. Methods: Patients with haemoglobin (Hb) data fromthe MAGGIC dataset were used. Anaemia was defined as Hb < 120 g/l in women and <130 g/l inmen. HF-PEF was defined as EF ? 50%; HF-REF was EF < 50%. Cox proportional hazardmodelling, with adjustment for clinically relevant variables, was undertaken to investigate factors associated with 3-year all-causemortality. Results: Thirteen thousand two hundred and ninety-five patients with HF from 19 studies (9887 with HF-REF and 3408 with HF-PEF). The prevalence of anaemia was similar among those with HF-REF and HF-PEF (42.8 and 41.6% respectively). Compared with patients with normal Hb values, those with anaemia were older, were more likely to have diabetes, ischaemic aetiology, New York Heart Association class IV symptoms, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate and were more likely to be taking diuretic and less likely to be taking a beta-blocker. Patients with anaemia had higher all-cause mortality (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.25-1.51), independent of EF group: aHR 1.67 (1.39-1.99) in HFPEF and aHR 2.49 (2.13-2.90) in HF-REF. Conclusions: Anaemia is an adverse prognostic factor in HF irrespective of EF. The prognostic importance of anaemia was greatest in patients with HF-REF. ? The Author 2015.

Methodology: Sixty-three adult survivors of marasmus and kwashiorkor could freely compose a diet from foods containing 10, 15 and 25 percentage energy from protein (percentage of energy derived from protein (PEP); Phase 1) for 3 days. Participants were then randomized in Phase 2 (5 days) to diets with PEP fixed at 10%, 15% or 25%. Results: Self-selected PEP was similar in both groups. In the groups combined, selected PEP was 14.7, which differed significantly (P < 0.0001) from the null expectation (16.7%) of no selection. Self-selected PEP was inversely related to birthweight, the effect disappearing after adjusting for sex and current body weight. In Phase 2, PEP correlated inversely with EI (P = 0.002) and weight change from Phase 1 to 2 (P = 0.002). Protein intake increased with increasing PEP, but to a lesser extent than energy increased with decreasing PEP. Conclusions and implications: Macronutrient intakes were not independently related to birthweight or diagnosis. In a free-choice situation (Phase 1), subjects selected a dietary PEP significantly lower than random. Lower PEP diets induce increased energy and decreased protein intake, and are associated with weight gain. ?

Methods A comprehensive search of Cochrane Library, PubMed, MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify relevant articles. The perioperative, postoperative and long term outcomes were compared. Results Eleven studies including 6051 patients met the inclusion criteria. The perioperative outcomes were comparable between the 2 groups. The BDTT group had higher proportion poorly differentiated tumours (OR?=?1.87, X2?=?10.00, df?=?6, p?=?0.002, I2?=?40%), Lymphovascular invasion (LVI) (OR?=?4.85, X2?=?28.21, df?=?9, p?=?&lt;0.001, I2?=?68%) and Macrovascular invasion (MVI) (OR?=?5.41, X2?=?8.73, df?=?9, p?=?&lt;0.001, I2?=?0%).

Recent studies investigating airway inflammation have demonstrated an association between hyaluronan (HA) accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration of the airways. The ECM proteoglycan versican interacts with HA and is important in the recruitment and activation of leukocytes during inflammation. We investigated the role of versican in the pathogenesis of asthmatic airway inflammation. Using cockroach antigen (CRA)–sensitized murine models of allergic asthma, we demonstrate increased subepithelial versican in the airways of CRA-treated mice that parallels subepithelial increases in HA and leukocyte infiltration. During the acute phase, CRA-treated mice displayed increased gene expression of the four major versican isoforms, as well as increased expression of HA synthases. Furthermore, in a murine model that examines both acute and chronic CRA exposure, versican staining peaked 8 days following CRA challenge and preceded subepithelial leukocyte infiltration. We also assessed versican and HA expression in differentiated primary human airway epithelial cells from asthmatic and healthy children. Increases in the expression of versican isoforms and HA synthases in these epithelial cells were similar to those of the murine model. These data indicate an important role for versican in the establishment of airway inflammation in asthma. ? 2016 The Histochemical Society.",Airway inflammation; Asthma; Cockroach antigen; Extracellular matrix; Hyaluronan; Macrophages; Versican,"antigen; cockroach antigen; hyaluronic acid; synthetase; unclassified drug; versican; antigen; Cspg2 protein, mouse; hyaluronic acid; versican; allergic asthma; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; child; clinical article; controlled study; extracellular matrix; female; human; human cell; inflammatory infiltrate; leukocyte activation; mouse; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; protein protein interaction; adolescent; animal; asthma; Bagg albino mouse; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; bronchus; C57BL mouse; case control study; cell culture; cell differentiation; cockroach; cytology; epithelium cell; immediate type hypersensitivity; immunology; leukocyte; lung; male; metabolism; pathology; Adolescent; Animals; Antigens; Asthma; Bronchi; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Case-Control Studies; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Child; Cockroaches; Epithelial Cells; Female; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Hypersensitivity, Immediate; Leukocytes; Lung; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Versicans",2-s2.0-84971434544

Data Sources: Databases were searched up to June 10, 2014, using medical subject headings. A secondary aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of social media use compared with no social media use in reducing the risk factors for noncommunicable diseases, stratifying the results by the extent of bias on outcomes, by social media use alone, and by the levels of social presence and media richness. Study Selection: Sixteen trials (n=10 711 participants) met the inclusion criteria, but interventions mostly used social media with low levels of media richness and presence (e.g., discussion boards, bulletin boards). Data Synthesis: Meta-analysis of all trials showed no significant differences (standardized mean difference [SMD] -0.14; 95%CI -0.28 to 0.01), with similar findings for physical activity (SMD 0.07; 95%CI -0.25 to 0.38), body weight (SMD 0.07; 95%CI -0.17 to 0.20), and fruit and vegetable intake (SMD 0.39; 95%CI -0.11 to 0.89). Trials assessing social media interventions aimed at modifying risk factors for noncommunicable diseases showed that social media use improved the primary outcomes, but the overall quality of the included studies limits the generalizability of these findings. Conclusion: Further trials are warranted, especially to isolate the effect of social media use and to fully evaluate the effect of the social presence and media richness of social media platforms. ?

The ubiquity of mobile devices and their effectiveness in promoting adherence in other areas of health behaviour change make them a promising tool to address adherence in Internet smoking cessation interventions. Text messaging is used by most adults, and messages can proactively encourage use of a web-based intervention. Text messaging can also be integrated with an Internet intervention to facilitate the use of core Internet intervention components. Methods and analysis: We identified four aspects of a text message intervention that may enhance its effectiveness in promoting adherence to a web-based smoking cessation programme: personalisation, integration, dynamic tailoring and message intensity. Phase I will use a two-level full factorial design to test the impact of these four experimental features on adherence to a web-based intervention. The primary outcome is a composite metric of adherence that incorporates general utilisation metrics (eg, logins, page views) and specific feature utilisation shown to predict abstinence. Participants will be N=860 adult smokers who register on an established Internet cessation programme and enrol in its text message programme. Phase II will be a two-arm randomised trial to compare the efficacy of the web-based cessation programme alone and in conjunction with the optimised text messaging intervention on 30-day point prevalence abstinence at 9 months. Phase II participants will be N=600 adult smokers who register to use an established Internet cessation programme and enrol in text messaging. Secondary analyses will explore whether adherence mediates the effect of treatment condition on outcome. Ethics and dissemination: This protocol was approved by Chesapeake IRB.

This study examined cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between obesogenic risk factors, weight status, and depressive symptomatology in a cohort of Australian adolescents. Design: Prospective cohort study. Setting: The study used repeated measures data from the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Its Your Move project, an Australian community-based obesity prevention intervention. Intervention effect was nonsignificant therefore intervention and comparison groups were combined in this study. Participants: Total sample was 634 secondary school students (female n=338, male n=296) with mean age 13 years (SD=0.6) at baseline (2012) and 15 years (SD=0.6) at follow-up (2014) recruited from 6 government secondary schools in the ACT. Primary and secondary outcomes measures: Primary outcome was depressive symptomatology measured by Short Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes were weight status, physical activity, screen time and diet related measures. Results: Increased physical activity was associated to lower depressive symptomatology among males (OR=0.35, p<0.05). Sweet drink (OR=1.15, p<0.05) and takeaway consumption (OR=1.84, p<0.05) were associated with higher levels of depressive symptomatology among females at follow-up. Males who were classified as overweight or obese at baseline, and remained so over the study period, were at increased risk of depressive symptomatology at followup (b=1.63, 95% CI 0.33 to 2.92). Inactivity among males over the 2-year study period was predictive of higher depressive symptomatology scores at follow-up (b=2.55, 95% CI 0.78 to 4.32). For females, those who increased their consumption of takeaway foods during the study period were at increased risk for developing depressive symptomatology (b=1.82, 95% CI -0.05 to 3.71). Conclusions: There are multiple, probably complex, relationships between diet, physical activity and outcomes of obesity and mental health as well as between the outcomes themselves. Healthier diets and increased physical activity should be foundations for healthier body weight and mental health.

However, the leading cause of mortality following a stroke is due to coronary artery disease (CAD) and myocardial infarction (MI) but that risk has not been robustly quantified. We sought to reliably quantify the risk of ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in patients presenting with acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) in the absence of a known cardiac history. Setting: A meta-analysis study. PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE and Google Scholar were searched for potential studies up to October 2015. Included studies reported an acute cerebral ischaemic event and followed for CAD or MI within 1 year in patients without known IHD. Using arcsine transformed proportions for meta-analysis, studies were combined using a generic inverse variance random-effects model to calculate the pooled standardised mean difference and 95% CIs. These were interpreted as the percentage prevalence of CAD or incidence of MI following AIS. Results: 17 studies with 4869 patients with AIS demonstrated a mean average of asymptomatic CAD in 52%. Anatomical methods of CAD detection revealed a prevalence of asymptomatic ?50% coronary stenosis in 32% (95% CI 19% to 47%; p<0.00001). 8 studies with 47229 patients with ischaemic stroke revealed an overall risk of MI in the year following stroke of 3% (95% CI 1% to 5%; p<0.00001) despite the absence of any cardiac history. Conclusions: One-third of patients with ischaemic stroke with no cardiac history have more than 50% coronary stenosis and 3% are at risk of developing MI within a year.

Methods: We employed a high-resolution spectral-temporal analysis of the cortical auditory evoked potential in response to a 150 ms speech sound /da/ in quiet and 3 dB SNR in 21 typically developing children (mean age = 10.7 years, standard deviation = 1.7) and 44 children with reported listening problems (LP) with absence of hearing loss (mean age = 10.3 years, standard deviation = 1.6). Children with LP were assessed for auditory processing disorder (APD) by which 24 children had APD, and 20 children did not. Peak latencies, magnitudes, and frequencies were compared between these groups. Results: Children with LP had frequency shifts in the theta, and alpha bands (< 0.05), and children with LP + APD had additional frequency (< 0.01) and latency shifts (< 0.05) in the upper beta and in the lower gamma bands. Conclusions: These results provide evidence for differences in higher level modulatory processing in children with LP, and that APD is driven by differences in early auditory encoding.

To develop an effective vaccine against T. gondii infection, we constructed a DNA vaccine encoding the T. gondii rhoptry protein 17 (TgROP17) and evaluated its immune protective efficacy against acute T. gondii infection in mice. The DNA vaccine (p3×Flag-CMV-14-ROP17) was intramuscularly injected to BALB/c mice and the immune responses of the vaccinated mice were determined. Compared to control mice treated with empty vector or PBS, mice immunized with the ROP17 vaccine showed a relatively high level of specific anti-T. gondii antibodies, and a mixed IgG1/IgG2a response with predominance of IgG2a production. The immunized mice also displayed a specific lymphocyte proliferative response, a Th1-type cellular immune response with production of IFN-γ and interleukin-2, and increased number of CD8+ T cells. Immunization with the ROP17 DNA significantly prolonged the survival time (15.6 ± 5.4 days, P &lt; 0.05) of mice after challenge infection with the virulent T. gondii RH strain (Type I), compared with the control groups which died within 8 days. Therefore, our data suggest that DNA vaccination with TgROP17 triggers significant humoral and cellular responses and induces effective protection in mice against acute T. gondii infection, indicating that TgROP17 is a promising vaccine candidate against acute toxoplasmosis. ?

It occurs both in isolation and as a complication of ankylosing spondylitis (AS). It is strongly associated with HLA-B?27, but previous studies have suggested that further genetic factors may confer additional risk. We sought to investigate this using the Illumina Exomechip microarray, to compare 1504 cases with AS and AAU, 1805 with AS but no AAU and 21 133 healthy controls. We also used a heterogeneity test to test the differences in effect size between AS with AAU and AS without AAU. In the analysis comparing AS+AAU+ cases versus controls, HLA-B?27 and HLA-A?02:01 were significantly associated with the presence of AAU (P<10 -300 and P=6 × 10 -8, respectively). Secondary independent association with PSORS1C3 (P=4.7 × 10 -5) and TAP2 (P=1.1 × 10 -5) were observed in the major histocompatibility complex. There was a new suggestive association with a low-frequency variant at zinc-finger protein 154 in the AS without AAU versus control analysis (zinc-finger protein 154 (ZNF154), P=2.2 × 10 -6). Heterogeneity testing showed that rs30187 in ERAP1 has a larger effect on AAU compared with that in AS alone. These findings also suggest that variants in ERAP1 have a differential impact on the risk of AAU when compared with AS, and hence the genetic risk for AAU differs from AS. ? 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited All rights reserved.",,"HLA antigen; HLA B antigen; zinc finger protein; HLA B27 antigen; acute anterior uveitis; ankylosing spondylitis; Article; controlled study; effect size; gene frequency; gene locus; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; heredity; human; iridocyclitis; major clinical study; major histocompatibility complex; overlapping gene; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; ankylosing spondylitis; case control study; complication; genetic heterogeneity; genetics; iridocyclitis; single nucleotide polymorphism; Case-Control Studies; Genetic Heterogeneity; HLA-B27 Antigen; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Spondylitis, Ankylosing; Uveitis, Anterior",2-s2.0-84956819816

Methods: This was an observational study of women with gestational diabetes diagnosed by early HbA1c screening or subsequent oral glucose tolerance test at &lt; 34 weeks' gestation who delivered at National Women's Health, Auckland, from July 2012 to June 2014. Data were extracted from the hospital database. Women with HbA1c 41-49 mmol/mol (5.9-6.6%) were divided into those seen &lt; 24 weeks (Early, n = 134) and those seen ? 24 weeks (Later, n = 151). Those with HbA1c &lt; 41 mmol/mol (5.9%) were labelled Other GDM (n = 661). Results: The Early and Later groups, compared with Other GDM, had more Polynesian and fewer (non-Indian) Asian women, higher BMI and more required medication (P &lt; 0.001). More were smokers (P = 0.007, 0.02) and more had chronic hypertension (P &lt; 0.001, 0.02). There were higher rates of adverse outcomes in the Later group than the Other GDM group (pre-eclampsia 8.0% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.001, preterm birth 16.6% vs. 8.2%, P = 0.002, neonatal admission 15.5% vs. 9.2%, P = 0.02). Outcomes were similar between the Early group and Other GDM group (pre-eclampsia 1.5% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.5, preterm birth 10.5% vs. 8.2% P = 0.4, neonatal admission 13.6% vs. 9.2%, P = 0.12). Comparing the Early and Later groups, the Early group had less pre-eclampsia, 1.5% vs. 8.0%, adjusted P = 0.03. Other outcomes were not statistically different. Conclusions: An HbA1c of 41-49 mmol/mol (5.9-6.7%) identifies a higher-risk group of women with gestational diabetes.

We hypothesized that a gene expression profile associated with WT1 expression levels might be a good surrogate marker. We identified high WT1 gene sets by comparing the gene expression profiles in the highest and lowest quartiles of WT1 expression in two large AML studies. Two high WT1 gene sets were found to be highly correlated in terms of the altered genes and expression profiles. We identified a 17-probe set signature of the high WT1 set as the optimal prognostic predictor in the first AML set, and showed that it was able to predict prognosis in the second AML series after adjustment for European LeukaemiaNet genetic groups. The gene signature also proved to be of prognostic value in a third AML series of 163 samples assessed by RNA sequencing, demonstrating its cross-platform consistency. This led us to derive a 4-gene expression score, which faithfully predicted adverse outcome. In conclusion, a short gene signature associated with high WT1 expression levels and the resultant 4-gene expression score were found to be predictive of adverse prognosis in AML. This study provides new clues to the molecular pathways underlying high WT1 states in leukaemia. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",AML; Expression score; Gene signature; Prognosis; WT1,"4 gene expression score; acute myeloblastic leukemia; adult; Article; cancer prognosis; event free survival; gene expression; gene mutation; genetic analysis; genetic association; human; major clinical study; molecular dynamics; oncogene; overall survival; priority journal; RNA sequence; sequence analysis; signal transduction; WT1 gene; blood; gene expression profiling; genetic marker; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; middle aged; procedures; prognosis; tumor suppressor gene; genetic marker; tumor marker; WT1 protein; WT1 protein, human; Adult; Biomarkers, Tumor; Gene Expression Profiling; Genes, Wilms Tumor; Genetic Markers; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Middle Aged; Prognosis; WT1 Proteins",2-s2.0-84955714491

This study investigates the risk of amputation among different ethnic groups after adjusting for demographic, socio-economic status and clinical variables. Methods: We used primary care data from a large national multi-ethnic cohort of patients with Type 2 diabetes in New Zealand and linked hospital records. The primary outcome was time from initial data collection to first lower limb amputation. Demographic variables included age of onset and duration since diabetes diagnosis, gender, ethnicity and socio-economic status. Clinical variables included smoking status, height and weight, blood pressure, HbA1c, total cholesterol/HDL ratio and albuminuria. Cox proportional hazards models were used. Results: There were 892 lower limb amputations recorded among 62 002 patients (2.11 amputations per 1000 person-years), followed for a median of 7.14 years (422 357 person-years). After adjusting for demographic and socio-economic variables and compared with Europeans, M?ori had the highest risk [hazard ratio (HR) 1.84 (95%CI:1.54-2.19)], whereas East Asians [HR 0.18, (0.08-0.44)] and South Asians [HR 0.39 (0.22-0.67)] had the lowest risk. Adjusting for available clinical variables reduced the differences but they remained substantial [HR 1.61 (1.35-1.93), 0.23 (0.10-0.56) and 0.48 (0.27-0.83), respectively]. Conclusions: Ethnic groups had significantly different risk of lower limb amputation, even after adjusting for demographic and some major clinical risk factors. Barriers to care should be addressed and intensive prevention strategies known to reduce the incidence of lower limb amputations could be prioritized to those at greatest risk. ? 2016 Diabetes UK.",,"cholesterol; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; Article; blood pressure; body height; body weight; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; diabetic patient; East Asian; ethnic group; ethnicity; European; human; Indian; leg amputation; macroalbuminuria; Maori (people); microalbuminuria; New Zealand; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; Pacific Islander; primary medical care; prospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; smoking; social status; South Asian; systolic blood pressure; amputation; Asian continental ancestry group; Caucasian; complication; diabetic foot; disease course; ethnology; female; follow up; health disparity; incidence; information retrieval; male; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Oceanic ancestry group; pathophysiology; primary health care; public health; public hospital; risk factor; survival analysis; Amputation; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Foot; Disease Progression; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status Disparities; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Incidence; Information Storage and Retrieval; Male; Middle Aged; National Health Programs; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Primary Health Care; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-84955644585

The authors hypothesize that any brain region demonstrating reduced activation to multisensory external stimuli around LOBR represents a key cortical gate underlying this transition. Furthermore, the authors hypothesize that this localized suppression is associated with breakdown in frontoparietal communication. Methods: During both simultaneous electroencephalography and functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) and electroencephalography data acquisition, 15 healthy volunteers experienced an ultraslow induction with propofol anesthesia while a paradigm of multisensory stimulation (i.e., auditory tones, words, and noxious pain stimuli) was presented. The authors performed separate analyses to identify changes in (1) stimulus-evoked activity, (2) functional connectivity, and (3) frontoparietal synchrony associated with LOBR. Results: By using an FMRI conjunction analysis, the authors demonstrated that stimulus-evoked activity was suppressed in the right dorsal anterior insula cortex (dAIC) to all sensory modalities around LOBR. Furthermore, the authors found that the dAIC had reduced functional connectivity with the frontoparietal regions, specifically the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and inferior parietal lobule, after LOBR. Finally, reductions in the electroencephalography power synchrony between electrodes located in these frontoparietal regions were observed in the same subjects after LOBR. Conclusions: The authors conclude that the dAIC is a potential cortical gate responsible for LOBR. Suppression of dAIC activity around LOBR was associated with disruption in the frontoparietal networks that was measurable using both electroencephalography synchrony and FMRI connectivity analyses. ? 2016, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc.

The increasing use of endoscopic submucosal dissection to treat early gastric cancer is a concern because regional lymph nodes are not addressed. The aim of the study was thus to critically evaluate current evidence with regard to tumour-specific factors associated with lymph node metastases in “early gastric cancer” to develop a more precise definition and improve clinical management. Methods: A systematic and comprehensive search of major reference databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and the Cochrane Library) was undertaken using a combination of text words “early gastric cancer”, “lymph node metastasis”, “factors”, “endoscopy”, “surgery”, “lymphadenectomy” “mucosa”, “submucosa”, “lymphovascular invasion”, “differentiated”, “undifferentiated” and “ulcer”. All available publications that described tumour-related factors associated with lymph node metastases in early gastric cancer were included. Results: The initial search yielded 1494 studies, of which 42 studies were included in the final analysis. Over time, the definition of early gastric cancer has broadened and the indications for endoscopic treatment have widened. The mean frequency of lymph node metastases increased on the basis of depth of infiltration (mucosa 6?% vs. submucosa 28?%), presence of lymphovascular invasion (absence 9?% vs. presence 53?%), tumour differentiation (differentiated 13?% vs. undifferentiated 34?%) and macroscopic type (elevated 13?% vs. flat 26?%) and tumour diameter (?2?cm 8?% vs. >2?cm 25?%). Conclusion: There is a need to re-examine the diagnosis and staging of early gastric cancer to ensure that patients with one or more identifiable risk factor for lymph node metastases are not denied appropriate chemotherapy and surgical resection. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Early gastric cancer, definitions, endoscopy; Outcome; Stomach",Article; cancer infiltration; cancer risk; early cancer; gastrointestinal endoscopy; human; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel metastasis; priority journal; stomach cancer; submucosa; systematic review; tumor differentiation; cancer staging; early cancer diagnosis; gastroscopy; lymph node; lymph node dissection; lymph node metastasis; pathology; retrospective study; stomach; Stomach Neoplasms; tumor invasion; Early Detection of Cancer; Gastroscopy; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Retrospective Studies; Stomach; Stomach Neoplasms,2-s2.0-84955204243

The intestine also plays key roles in the elimination of waste and protection from infection. Critical to all of these functions is the intricate, highly coordinated motion of the intestinal tract, known as motility, which is coregulated by hormonal, neural, electrophysiological and other factors. The Virtual Intestine encapsulates a series of mathematical models of intestinal function in health and disease, with a current focus on motility, and particularly electrophysiology. The Virtual Intestine is being cohesively established across multiple physiological scales, from sub/cellular functions to whole organ levels, facilitating quantitative evaluations that present an integrative in silico framework. The models are also now finding broad physiological applications, including in evaluating hypotheses of slow wave pacemaker mechanisms, smooth muscle electrophysiology, structure-function relationships, and electromechanical coupling. Clinical applications are also beginning to follow, including in the pathophysiology of motility disorders, diagnosing intestinal ischemia, and visualizing colonic dysfunction. These advances illustrate the emerging potential of the Virtual Intestine to effectively address multiscale research challenges in interdisciplinary gastrointestinal sciences.

Purpose Evaluate the influences of lower limb muscle performance, static balance, functional independence and quality of life on fall risk as assessed with the timed up and go (TUG) test. Design Cross-sectional study. Methods Fifty-two residents aged 80 or older were assessed and distributed in one of the two study groups (no risk of falls; risk of falls) according to the time to complete the TUG test. A Kistler force platform and linear transducer was used to determinate lower limb muscle performance. Postural Stability (static balance) was measured by recording the center of pressure. The EuroQol-5 dimension was used to assess Health-related quality of life and the Barthel index was used to examine functional status. Student's t-test was performed to evaluate the differences between groups. Correlations between variables were analyzed using Spearman or Pearson coefficient. ROC (receiver operating charasteristic) analysis was used to determine the cut-off points related to a decrease in the risk of a fall. Findings Participants of no-fall risk group showed better lower limb performance, quality of life, and functional status. Cut-off points were determined for each outcome. Conclusions Risk of falls in nursing home residents over the age of 80 is associated with lower limb muscle performance, functional status, and quality of Life. Clinical Relevance Cut-off points can be used by clinicians when working toward fall prevention and could help in determining the optimal lower limb muscle performance level for preventing falls. ? 2015 Association of Rehabilitation Nurses.",accidental falls; aging; Cross-sectional study; lower extremity; Nursing homes; quality of life,"aged; body equilibrium; cross-sectional study; falling; female; human; male; nursing home; prevention and control; procedures; quality of life; rehabilitation nursing; risk assessment; risk factor; Spain; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Accidental Falls; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Nursing Homes; Postural Balance; Quality of Life; Rehabilitation Nursing; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Spain",2-s2.0-84954372379

Cumulative evidence has implicated vitamin D deficiency in increasing susceptibility to various gastrointestinal disorders, including colorectal cancer, inflammatory bowel diseases, diverticulitis, and irritable bowel syndrome. There is also reason to suggest adjunct vitamin D therapy for such diseases. Although there is justification for increasing vitamin D intake overall, optimal intakes will vary among individuals. Genomic technologies have revealed several hundreds of genes associated with vitamin D actions. The nature of these genes emphasizes the potentially negative implications of modulating vitamin D intakes in the absence of complementary human genetic and genomic data, including information on the gut microbiome. However, we are not yet in a position to apply this information. Genomic data (transcriptomics, metabolomics, proteomics, and metagenomics) could provide evidence that vitamin D sufficiency has been achieved. We suggest that there is an increasingly strong case for considering the more widespread use of vitamin D fortified foods and/or dietary supplements to benefit gastrointestinal health. However, intake levels might beneficially be informed by personalized genetic and genomic information, for optimal disease prevention and maintenance of remission. ? 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Mdr1a-/- and FVB control mice were randomly assigned to an AIN-76A (control) diet or AIN-76A+0.2% curcumin. At 21 or 24weeks of age, colonic histological injury score (HIS) was determined, colon mRNA transcript levels were assessed using microarrays and colon protein expression was measured using 2D gel electrophoresis and LCMS protein identification. Colonic HIS of Mdr1a-/- mice fed the AIN-76A diet was higher (P&lt;.001) than FVB mice fed the same diet; the curcumin-supplemented diet reduced colonic HIS (P&lt;.05) in Mdr1a-/- mice. Microarray and proteomics analyses combined with new data analysis tools, such as the Ingenuity Pathways Analysis regulator effects analysis, showed that curcumin's antiinflammatory activity in Mdr1a-/- mouse colon may be mediated by activation of α-catenin, which has not previously been reported. We also show evidence to support curcumin's action via multiple molecular pathways including reduced immune response, increased xenobiotic metabolism, resolution of inflammation through decreased neutrophil migration and increased barrier remodeling. Key transcription factors and other regulatory molecules (ERK, FN1, TNFSF12 and PI3K complex) activated in inflammation were down-regulated by dietary intervention with curcumin. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Alpha catenin; Curcuma longa; Extracellular matrix; Oligonucleotide array sequence analysis; Two-dimensional difference gel electrophoresis,"alpha catenin; curcumin; FN1 protein; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; proteome; TNFSF12 protein; transcription factor; transcriptome; unclassified drug; curcumin; multidrug resistance protein; multidrug resistance protein 3; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell migration; controlled study; diet therapy; down regulation; histological injury score; immune response; inflammatory bowel disease; male; microarray analysis; mouse; neutrophil; nonhuman; protein expression; proteomics; scoring system; transcriptomics; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; xenobiotic metabolism; animal; colitis; diet; disease model; genetics; inflammatory bowel disease; molecular model; pathology; Animals; Colitis; Curcumin; Diet; Disease Models, Animal; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Mice; Models, Molecular; P-Glycoproteins",2-s2.0-84952862240

Although the diagnostic criteria are the same in each subgroup of preeclampsia, it has been suggested that the maternal and perinatal mortalities of early onset and late onset preeclampsia are different. However, studies that compare clinical parameters or laboratory biomarkers between early onset and late onset preeclampsia are limited. Data on 177 women with early or late preeclampsia with severe hypertension were collected from a University Teaching Hospital from January 2010 to January 2011 and analysed. Data included all the clinical parameters and laboratory biomarkers of liver and renal function. 63 women and 114 women were diagnosed with early and late preeclampsia with severe hypertension, respectively. There was no difference in the maternal age and the incidence of clinical symptoms including edema, vision disturbance, severe headache and stillbirth between two groups. There was a decrease in alkaline phosphatase levels in early preeclampsia with severe hypertension but other markers of liver function were not altered. However, renal function including blood urea nitrogen, creatinine and uric acid were significantly higher in early preeclampsia with severe hypertension. Umbilical artery systolic velocity/diastolic velocity ratio was significantly higher in early preeclampsia with severe hypertension.

Cabozantinib has recently been approved for treating advanced medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), but its long-term benefit remains uncertain and dose-dependent adverse events are very common. The present study has demonstrated that 2-methoxyestradiol (2ME2), an inhibitor of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs) and a promising anticancer agent under investigation in clinical trials, strengthens anticancer activities of cabozantinib against MTC cells in vitro and in vivo. The activated hypoxia-inducible pathways, which are mainly regulated by HIF-1, contribute to the resistance of hypoxic MTC cells to cabozantinib. Cabozantinib upregulated HIF-1α expression at translational levels and increased the expression of the downstream factors including VEGF, lactate dehydrogenase A (LDHA), HGF, and MET. 2ME2 corrected the activated pathways by cabozantinib through downregulating HIF-1α expression and inhibiting its nuclear translocation in hypoxic MTC cells. Administration of 2ME2 enhanced the efficacy of cabozantinib in suppressing the growth of MTC cell line xenografts and patient-derived xenografts established in mice. Given that 2ME2 targets insensitive hypoxic cancer cells to cabozantinib and can inhibit the activated pathways by cabozantinib, the present results warrant further investigation of 2ME2, particularly in combination with cabozantinib, for the treatment of MTC. ? 2015, International Society of Oncology and BioMarkers (ISOBM).",2-Methoxyestradiol; Cabozantinib; Hypoxia-inducible factor; Medullary thyroid carcinoma; Signal transduction pathway,"2 methoxyestradiol; cabozantinib; cyclin D1; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; hypoxia inducible factor 2alpha; lactate dehydrogenase; lactate dehydrogenase A; protein Ret; scatter factor; scatter factor receptor; unclassified drug; vasculotropin receptor 2; 2-methoxyestradiol; anilide; antineoplastic agent; cabozantinib; estradiol; HIF1A protein, human; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; isoenzyme; Ki 67 antigen; lactate dehydrogenase; lactate dehydrogenase 5; pyridine derivative; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; case report; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; female; gene expression; human; human cell; human tissue; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; nonhuman; nuclear localization signal; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; thyroid medullary carcinoma; upregulation; active transport; analogs and derivatives; animal; Bagg albino mouse; cancer transplantation; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; cell survival; chemistry; drug screening; hypoxia; metabolism; mouse; nude mouse; signal transduction; Thyroid Neoplasms; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; Adult; Anilides; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Estradiol; Female; Humans; Hypoxia; Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; Isoenzymes; Ki-67 Antigen; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Neoplasm Transplantation; Pyridines; Signal Transduction; Thyroid Neoplasms; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84938117930

The recounting of autobiographical events is inextricably linked to linguistic knowledge, yet no study to date has investigated whether tense use during autobiographical narration is disrupted in dementia syndromes. This study investigated the incidence of correct past tense use during ABM narration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n?=?10) and semantic dementia (SD, n?=?10) in comparison with healthy older Controls (n?=?10). Autobiographical narratives were analysed for episodic content (internal/external) and classified according to tense use (past/present). Across both patient groups, use of the past tense was significantly compromised relative to Controls, with increased levels of off-target present tense verbs observed. Voxel-based morphometry analyses based on structural MRI revealed differential associations between past tense use and regions of grey matter intensity in the brain. Bilateral temporal cortices were implicated in the SD group, whereas frontal, lateral, and medial temporal regions including the right hippocampus emerged in AD. This preliminary study provides the first demonstration of the disruption of specific linguistic constructs during autobiographical narration in AD and SD.

Using bioinformatics analysis of the complete S. pyogenes strain SF370 genome, we have identified a novel S. pyogenes virulence factor, which we termed streptococcal 5'-nucleotidaseA(S5nA).Arecombinant form of S5nA hydrolyzed AMP and ADP, but not ATP, to generate the immunomodulatory molecule adenosine. Michaelis-Menten kinetics revealed aKmof 169'Mand aVmax of 7550 nmol/mg/min for the substrate AMP. Furthermore, recombinant S5nA acted synergistically with S. pyogenes nuclease A to generate macrophagetoxic deoxyadenosine from DNA. The enzyme showed optimal activity betweenpH5 andpH6.5 and between 37 and 47 ?°C. Like other 5'-nucleotidases, S5nA requires divalent cations and was active in the presence of Mg2+, Ca2+, or Mn2+. However, Zn2+ inhibited the enzymatic activity. Structural modeling combined with mutational analysis revealed a highly conserved catalytic dyad as well as conserved substrate and cation-binding sites. Recombinant S5nA significantly increased the survival of the non-pathogenic bacterium Lactococcus lactis during a human whole blood killing assay in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting a role as an S. pyogenes virulence factor. In conclusion, we have identified a novel S. pyogenes enzyme with 5'-nucleotidase activity and immune evasion properties. ? 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,Bacteria; Binding sites; Positive ions; Bioinformatics analysis; Dose-dependent manner; Enzymatic activities; Michaelis-Menten kinetic; Mutational analysis; Non-pathogenic bacterium; Streptococcus pyogenes; Structural modeling; Enzyme activity; calcium ion; deoxyadenosine; DNA; magnesium ion; manganese; recombinant enzyme; Streptococcal 5' nucleotidase A protein; unclassified drug; virulence factor; zinc ion; bacterial protein; glycosidase; virulence factor; Article; bacterial survival; binding site; controlled study; enzyme specificity; hydrolysis; immune evasion; Lactococcus lactis; Michaelis Menten kinetics; mutational analysis; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; Streptococcus pyogenes; structure analysis; genetics; human; immunology; macrophage; microbial viability; pathogenicity; serum bactericidal activity; Bacterial Proteins; Blood Bactericidal Activity; Humans; Immune Evasion; Lactococcus lactis; Macrophages; Microbial Viability; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases; Streptococcus pyogenes; Virulence Factors,2-s2.0-84951774202

The volume of enteral nutrition received, however, is often much less than prescribed due to multiple functional and process issues. To deliver the prescribed volume and correct the energy deficit associated with enteral nutrition alone, parenteral nutrition can be used in combination (termed ""supplemental parenteral nutrition""), but benefits of this method have not been firmly established. A multi-centre, randomised, clinical trial is currently underway to determine if prescribed energy requirements can be provided to critically ill patients by using a supplemental parenteral nutrition strategy in the critically ill. Methods/design: This prospective, multi-centre, randomised, stratified, parallel-group, controlled, phase II trial aims to determine whether a supplemental parenteral nutrition strategy will reliably and safely increase energy intake when compared to usual care. The study will be conducted for 100 critically ill adults with at least one organ system failure and evidence of insufficient enteral intake from six intensive care units in Australia and New Zealand. Enrolled patients will be allocated to either a supplemental parenteral nutrition strategy for 7 days post randomisation or to usual care with enteral nutrition. The primary outcome will be the average energy amount delivered from nutrition therapy over the first 7 days of the study period. Secondary outcomes include protein delivery for 7 days post randomisation; total energy and protein delivery, antibiotic use and organ failure rates (up to 28 days); duration of ventilation, length of intensive care unit and hospital stay. At both intensive care unit and hospital discharge strength and health-related quality of life assessments will be undertaken. Study participants will be followed up for health-related quality of life, resource utilisation and survival at 90 and 180 days post randomisation (unless death occurs first). Discussion: This trial aims to determine if provision of a supplemental parenteral nutrition strategy to critically ill adults will increase energy intake compared to usual care in Australia and New Zealand. Trial outcomes will guide development of a subsequent larger randomised controlled trial.

It seems plausible that such a volume-outcome relationship is also present in dialysis. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched in November 2014 for non-experimental studies evaluating the association between center volume and patient outcomes [mortality, morbidity, peritonitis, switch to hemodialysis (HD) or any other treatment], without language restrictions or other limits. Selection of relevant studies, data extraction and critical appraisal were performed by two independent reviewers. We did not perform meta-analysis due to clinical and methodological heterogeneity (e.g. different volume categories). Results: 16 studies met out inclusion criteria. Most studies were performed in the US. The study quality ranged from fair to good. Only few items were judged to have a high risk of bias, while many items were judged to have an unclear risk of bias due to insufficient reporting. All 10 studies that analyzed peritoneal dialysis (PD) technique survival by modeling switch to HD or any other treatment as an outcome showed a statistical significant effect. The relative effect measures ranged from 0.25 to 0.94 (median 0.73) in favor of high volume centers. All nine studies indicated a lower mortality for PD in high volume centers, but only study was statistical significant. Conclusions: This systematic review supports a volume-outcome relationship in peritoneal dialysis with respect to switch to HD or any other treatment. An effect on mortality is probably present in HD. Further research is needed to identify and understand the associations of center volume that are causally related to patient benefit. ? 2015 Pieper et al.","Dialysis; Hospitals, high volume; Kidney failure; Outcome assessment; Review","hemodialysis; high volume hospital; human; outcome assessment; Renal Insufficiency; statistics and numerical data; Hospitals, High-Volume; Humans; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Renal Dialysis; Renal Insufficiency",2-s2.0-84951268922

This synthesis originates in the use of a highly selective acyl-Claisen reaction to provide a syn morpholine amide which ultimately determines a trans relationship at the 3- and 4-positions on the central ring. Initial attempts at the synthesis resulted in premature cyclisation, producing either dihydro-pyrrole or tetrahydrofuran structures. Later stage introduction of the amine functionality resulted in successful synthesis of aza-lignans. This synthesis allows for several variations in the aza-lignan structure, including the substitution on the aromatic ring and the amine that can be incorporated, resulting in the synthesis of a range of aza-analogues of fragransin A2 and galbelgin. Furthermore, these analogues have been tested for their anti-proliferative properties against various human cancer cell lines, along with their naturally occurring THF counterparts. Results show that for most cases, aza-derivatives are more active than the corresponding THF compound, with the most active compound, the aza-derivative of fragransin A2, IC50 5.1 μM against a human breast cancer cell line. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.All rights reserved.",Acyl-Claisen; Anti-proliferative activity; Aza-lignan; Lignan; Pyrrolidines,"1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethyl 1 (methoxymethoxy) 4 butanal; 1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethyl 1 (methoxymethoxy)pent 4 ene; 1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethyl 1 (tert butyldimethylsilyloxy) 4 butanal; 1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethyl 1 (tert butyldimethylsilyloxy)pent 4 ene 23; 1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethylpent 4 en 1 ol; 1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethylpent 4 en 1 one; 1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethylpent 4 enyl(phenyl)carbamate; 1,4 bis(4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethyl 1 (methoxymethoxy) 4 butanone; 1,4 bis(4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethyl 1 (methoxymethoy)butan 4 ol; 1,4 bis(4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethyl 1 (tert butyldimethylsilyloxy) 4 butan 4 ol; 1,4 bis(4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethyl 4 (phenylamino)butan 1 ol; 2 (4 methoxyphenyl) 3,4 dimethyl 1 phenyl 2,3 dihydro 1h pyrrole; 2,3 dimethyl 1 morpholinopent 4 en 1 one; 2,5 bis(4 methoxyphenyl) 3,4 dimethyltetrahydrofuran; 4 [(tert butyldimethylsilyl)oxy] 1,4 bis(4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethylbutan 1 one; 5 (4 methoxyphenyl) 3,4 dimethyl 5 (phenylamino)pentane 1,2 diol; amine; antineoplastic agent; fragransin a2; galbelgin; lignan; n [1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethylpent 4 enyl] aniline; n [1 (methoxymethoxy) 1,4 bis(4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethylbutylidene]aniline; n [1 (methoxymethoxy) 1,4 bis(4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethylbutyl]aniline; n [1 [(tert butyldimethylsilyl)oxy] 1,4 bis(4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethylbutylidene]aniline; n [1 [(tert butyldimethylsilyl)oxy] 1,4 bis(4 methoxyphenyl)2,3 dimethylbutyl]aniline; pyrrole derivative; tetrahydrofuran; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; [1 (4 methoxyphenyl) 2,3 dimethylpent 4 enylidene]aniline; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; controlled study; cyclization; drug selectivity; drug synthesis; human; human cell; IC50; priority journal",2-s2.0-84946760979

There is no consensus as to the safety profile of different treatment regimens with respect to dose, duration, route and timing of administration. Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of alternative magnesium sulphate regimens when used as single agent tocolytic therapy during pregnancy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (30 September 2015) and reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomised trials comparing different magnesium sulphate treatment regimens when used as single agent tocolytic therapy during pregnancy in women in preterm labour. Quasi-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion but none were identified. Cross-over and cluster trials were not eligible for inclusion. Health outcomes were considered at the level of the mother, the infant/child and the health service. Intervention: intravenous or oral magnesium sulphate given alone for tocolysis. Comparison: alternative dosing regimens of magnesium sulphate given alone for tocolysis. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Main results: Three trials including 360 women and their infants were identified as eligible for inclusion in this review. Two trials were rated as low risk of bias for random sequence generation and concealment of allocation. A third trial was assessed as unclear risk of bias for these domains but did not report data for any of the outcomes examined in this review. No trials were rated to be of high quality overall. Intravenous magnesium sulphate was administered according to low-dose regimens (4 g loading dose followed by 2 g/hour continuous infusion and/or increased by 1 g/hour hourly until successful tocolysis or failure of treatment), or high-dose regimens (4 g loading dose followed by 5 g/hour continuous infusion and increased by 1 g/hour hourly until successful tocolysis or failure of treatment, or 6 g loading dose followed by 2 g/hour continuous infusion and increased by 1 g/hour hourly until successful tocolysis or failure of treatment). There were no differences seen between high-dose magnesium sulphate regimens compared with low-dose magnesium sulphate regimens for the primary outcome of fetal, neonatal and infant death (risk ratio (RR) 0.43, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.12 to 1.56; one trial, 100 infants). Using the GRADE approach, the evidence for fetal, neonatal and infant death was considered to be VERY LOW quality. No data were reported for any of the other primary maternal and infant health outcomes (birth less than 48 hours after trial entry; composite serious infant outcome; composite serious maternal outcome). There were no clear differences seen between high-dose magnesium sulphate regimens compared with low-dose magnesium sulphate regimens for the secondary infant health outcomes of fetal death; neonatal death; and rate of hypocalcaemia, osteopenia or fracture; and secondary maternal health outcomes of rate of caesarean birth; pulmonary oedema; and maternal self-reported adverse effects. Pulmonary oedema was reported in two women given high-dose magnesium sulphate, but not in any of the women given low-dose magnesium sulphate. In a single trial of high and low doses of magnesium sulphate for tocolysis including 100 infants, the risk of respiratory distress syndrome was lower with use of a high-dose regimen compared with a low-dose regimen (RR 0.31, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.88; one trial, 100 infants). Using the GRADE approach, the evidence for respiratory distress syndrome was judged to be LOW quality. No difference was seen in the rate of admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. However, for those babies admitted, a high-dose regimen was associated with a reduction in the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit compared with a low-dose regimen (mean difference -3.10 days, 95% confidence interval -5.48 to -0.72). We found no data for the majority of our secondary outcomes. Authors' conclusions: There are limited data available (three studies, with data from only two studies) comparing different dosing regimens of magnesium sulphate given as single agent tocolytic therapy for the prevention of preterm birth. There is no evidence examining duration of therapy, timing of therapy and the role for repeat dosing. Downgrading decisions for our primary outcome of fetal, neonatal and infant death were based on wide confidence intervals (crossing the line of no effect), lack of blinding and a limited number of studies. No data were available for any of our other important outcomes: birth less than 48 hours after trial entry; composite serious infant outcome; composite serious maternal outcome. The data are limited by volume and the outcomes reported. Only eight of our 45 pre-specified primary and secondary maternal and infant health outcomes were reported on in the included studies. No long-term outcomes were reported. Downgrading decisions for the evidence on the risk of respiratory distress were based on wide confidence intervals (crossing the line of no effect) and lack of blinding. There is some evidence from a single study suggesting a reduction in the length of stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and a reduced risk of respiratory distress syndrome where a high-dose regimen of magnesium sulphate has been used compared with a low-dose regimen. However, given that evidence has been drawn from a single study (with a small sample size), these data should be interpreted with caution. Magnesium sulphate has been shown to be of benefit in a wide range of obstetric settings, although it has not been recommended for tocolysis. In clinical settings where health benefits are established, further trials are needed to address the lack of evidence regarding the optimal dose (loading dose and maintenance dose), duration of therapy, timing of therapy and role for repeat dosing in terms of efficacy and safety for mothers and their children. Ongoing examination of different regimens with respect to important health outcomes is required. ? 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"magnesium sulfate; magnesium sulfate; uterus spasmolytic agent; clinical effectiveness; confusion; dose response; drowsiness; drug safety; fetus mortality; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; health service; human; length of stay; lethargy; lung edema; maternal care; medical decision making; muscle weakness; neonatal respiratory distress syndrome; newborn care; outcome assessment; polydipsia; premature labor; priority journal; respiratory arrest; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; side effect; systematic review; tocolysis; treatment duration; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; child death; female; fetus death; Fractures, Bone; hypocalcemia; infant; intravenous drug administration; meta analysis; newborn; Obstetric Labor, Premature; perinatal death; pregnancy; Premature Birth; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); tocolysis; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; Female; Fetal Death; Fractures, Bone; Humans; Hypocalcemia; Infant; Infant Death; Infant, Newborn; Injections, Intravenous; Magnesium Sulfate; Obstetric Labor, Premature; Perinatal Death; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Tocolysis; Tocolytic Agents",2-s2.0-84959136205

Thus, we propose that inhibitors that bind to a coactivator-binding pocket on ERaα, called activation function 2 (AF2), might overcome some of these limitations. Methods: In silico virtual screening was used to identify small-molecule ERaα AF2 inhibitors. These compounds were screened for inhibition of ERaα transcriptional activity using stably transfected T47D-KBluc cell line. A direct physical interaction between the AF2 binders and the ERaα protein was measured using biolayer interferometry (BLI) and an ERaα coactivator displacement assay. Cell viability was assessed by MTS assay in ERaα-positive MCF7 cells, tamoxifen-resistant (TamR) cell lines TamR3 and TamR6, and ERaα-negative MDA-MB-453 and HeLa cell lines. In addition, ERaα inhibition in TamR cells and the effect of compounds on mRNA and protein expression of oestrogen-dependent genes, pS2, cathepsin D and cell division cycle 2 (CDC2) were determined. Results: Fifteen inhibitors from two chemical classes, derivatives of pyrazolidine-3,5-dione and carbohydrazide, were identified. In a series of in vitro assays, VPC-16230 of the carbohydrazide chemical class emerged as a lead ERaα AF2 inhibitor that significantly downregulated ERaα transcriptional activity (half-maximal inhibitory concentration = 5.81 μM). By directly binding to the ERaα protein, as confirmed by BLI, VPC-16230 effectively displaced coactivator peptides from the AF2 pocket, confirming its site-specific action. VPC-16230 selectively suppressed the growth of ERaα-positive breast cancer cells. Furthermore, it significantly inhibited ERaα mediated transcription in TamR cells. More importantly, it reduced mRNA and protein levels of pS2, cathepsin D and CDC2, validating its ER-directed activity. Conclusion: We identified VPC-16230 as an ERaα AF2-specific inhibitor that demonstrated promising antiproliferative effects in breast cancer cell lines, including TamR cells. VPC-16230 reduced the expression of ERaα-inducible genes, including CDC2, which is involved in cell division. We anticipate that the application of ERaα AF2 inhibitors will provide a novel approach that can act as a complementary therapeutic to treat ERaα-positive, tamoxifen-resistant and metastatic breast cancers. ? 2015 Singh et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",,"activation function 2; antineoplastic agent; carbohydrazide; cathepsin D; cell cycle protein; cell division cycle 2; chemical compound; cyclin dependent kinase 1; estrogen receptor alpha; estrogen receptor antagonist; messenger RNA; protein pS2; pyrazolidine 3,5 dione; tamoxifen; unclassified drug; vpc 13002; vpc 16225; vpc 16230; carrier protein; estradiol; estrogen; estrogen receptor alpha; ligand; molecular library; protein binding; selective estrogen receptor modulator; antiproliferative activity; Article; biolayer interferometry; breast cancer cell line; cancer inhibition; cathepsin D gene; CDC2 gene; cell viability; controlled study; down regulation; estrogen binding; gene expression regulation; growth inhibition; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; hydrophobicity; IC50; in vitro study; inhibition kinetics; interferometry; MCF 7 cell line; MDA MB 453 cell line; molecular docking; MTS assay; pharmacological blocking; protein determination; protein expression; protein protein interaction; pS2 gene; stable transfection; TamR3 cell line; TamR6 cell line; transcription initiation; validation study; antagonists and inhibitors; binding site; breast tumor; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; computer simulation; drug development; drug effects; drug resistance; drug screening; enzyme active site; female; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; molecular library; procedures; protein conformation; protein domain; reproducibility; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Binding Sites; Breast Neoplasms; Carrier Proteins; Catalytic Domain; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Computer Simulation; Drug Discovery; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Estrogen Receptor Modulators; Estrogens; Female; Humans; Ligands; MCF-7 Cells; Models, Molecular; Protein Binding; Protein Conformation; Protein Interaction Domains and Motifs; Reproducibility of Results; Small Molecule Libraries; Transcription, Genetic",2-s2.0-84928738989

Three main developments support this style of analysis: state-of-the-Art cardiac imaging technologies, modern computational infrastructure, and advanced mathematical modeling techniques. In vivo measurements of cardiac structure and function can be integrated using sophisticated computational methods to investigate mechanisms of myocardial function and dysfunction, and can aid in clinical diagnosis and developing personalized treatment. In this article, we review the state-of-the-Art in cardiac imaging modalities, model-based interpretation of 3D images of cardiac structure and function, and recent advances in modeling that allow personalized predictions of heart mechanics. We discuss how using such image-based modeling frameworks can increase the understanding of the fundamental biophysics behind cardiac mechanics, and assist with diagnosis, surgical guidance, and treatment planning. Addressing the challenges in this field will require a coordinated effort from both the clinical-imaging and modeling communities. We also discuss future directions that can be taken to bridge the gap between basic science and clinical translation. ? 2015 by Annual Reviews.

In contrast to the understanding of bone development within the epiphyseal growth plate, factors that regulate periosteal osteogenesis have not been studied as intensively. Osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD) is a congenital disorder of osteogenesis and is typically sporadic and characterized by radiolucent lesions affecting the cortical bone immediately under the periosteum of the tibia and fibula. We identified germline mutations in MET, encoding a receptor tyrosine kinase, that segregate with an autosomal-dominant form of OFD in three families and a mutation in a fourth affected subject from a simplex family and with bilateral disease. Mutations identified in all families with dominant inheritance and in the one simplex subject with bilateral disease abolished the splice inclusion of exon 14 in MET transcripts, which resulted in a MET receptor (METΔ14) lacking a cytoplasmic juxtamembrane domain. Splice exclusion of this domain occurs during normal embryonic development, and forced induction of this exon-exclusion event retarded osteoblastic differentiation in vitro and inhibited bone-matrix mineralization. In an additional subject with unilateral OFD, we identified a somatic MET mutation, also affecting exon 14, that substituted a tyrosine residue critical for MET receptor turnover and, as in the case of the METΔ14 mutations, had a stabilizing effect on the mature protein. Taken together, these data show that aberrant MET regulation via the juxtamembrane domain subverts core MET receptor functions that regulate osteogenesis within cortical diaphyseal bone. ? 2015 The American Society of Human Genetics.",,"acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme; alkaline phosphatase; complementary DNA; cycline; DNA; oligoribonucleotide; osteoclast differentiation factor; scatter factor receptor; transcription factor osterix; tyrosine; MET protein, human; scatter factor receptor; adult; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; autosomal dominant inheritance; bone development; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; cellular distribution; chromosome 11; chromosome 7; chromosome identification; controlled study; DNA extraction; dominant inheritance; exon; exon skipping; female; fibrous dysplasia; genetic linkage; genetic transfection; germline mutation; haplotype; human; human cell; human tissue; in situ hybridization; in vitro study; intron; linkage analysis; male; microsatellite marker; missense mutation; mouse; nonhuman; osteofibrous dysplasia; phylogeny; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; RNA sequence; somatic mutation; transient transfection; Western blotting; bone dysplasia; child; dominant gene; exon; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; middle aged; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; osteoblast; pathology; pedigree; periosteum; primary cell culture; protein tertiary structure; RNA splicing; Adult; Base Sequence; Bone Diseases, Developmental; Cell Differentiation; Child; Exons; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genes, Dominant; Germ-Line Mutation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Sequence Data; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Pedigree; Periosteum; Primary Cell Culture; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; RNA Splicing",2-s2.0-84951826019

Clinical trials conducted over the past decade have shown that these benefits may be increased further through administration of repeat doses of antenatal glucocorticoids in women at ongoing risk of preterm and in those undergoing elective cesarean at term. At the same time, a growing body of experimental animal evidence and observational data in humans has linked fetal overexposure to maternal glucocorticoids with increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic and other disorders in later life. Despite these concerns, and somewhat surprisingly, there has been little evidence to date from randomized trials of longer-term harm from clinical doses of synthetic glucocorticoids. However, with wider clinical application of antenatal glucocorticoid therapy there has been greater need to consider the potential for later adverse effects. This paper reviews current evidence for the short- and long-term health effects of antenatal glucocorticoids and discusses the apparent discrepancy between data from randomized clinical trials and other studies. ?

The current study investigated the role of self-compassion in predicting depression, diabetes-specific distress and HbA1c in patients with diabetes. Aims: To assess the specific operationalization of negative emotionality that best predicted HbA1c and to test whether self-compassion would buffer HbA1c in patients with diabetes against the negative effects of distress. Methods: Patients with diabetes (n?=?110) completed measures assessing trait self-compassion, depression and diabetes-distress. HbA1c results were obtained through medical records. Results: As expected, diabetes-specific distress was a better predictor of HbA1c than depression; self-compassion moderated the relationship between distress and HbA1c such that higher distress predicted higher HbA1c at lower levels of self-compassion, but not at higher levels of self-compassion. Conclusions: In addition to further demonstrating the link between distress and metabolic outcomes, these findings suggest that self-compassion might buffer patients from the negative metabolic consequences of diabetes-distress. ? 2015 Diabetes UK.",,"hemoglobin A1c; insulin; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; adult; Article; controlled study; depression; distress syndrome; emotionality; female; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major clinical study; male; medical record; metabolic regulation; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prediction; adverse effects; aged; attitude to health; blood; complication; cost of illness; cross-sectional study; depression; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; hyperglycemia; mental stress; middle aged; multimodality cancer therapy; patient compliance; prevention and control; psychological adjustment; psychological rating scale; psychology; Adult; Aged; Combined Modality Therapy; Cost of Illness; Cross-Sectional Studies; Depression; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Emotional Adjustment; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Male; Medical Records; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-84983212554

heritable trait, but genome-wide association studies have identified few genetic risk factors. Epidemiological studies suggest associations between BMD and several traits and diseases, but the nature of the suggestive comorbidity is still unknown. We used a novel genetic pleiotropy-informed conditional False Discovery Rate (FDR) method to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with BMD by leveraging cardiovascular disease (CVD) associated disorders and metabolic traits. By conditioning on SNPs associated with the CVD-related phenotypes, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high density lipoprotein, low density lipoprotein, triglycerides and waist hip ratio, we identified 65 novel independent BMD loci (26 with femoral neck BMD and 47 with lumbar spine BMD) at conditional FDR < 0.01. Many of the loci were confirmed in genetic expression studies. Genes validated at the mRNA levels were characteristic for the osteoblast/osteocyte lineage, Wnt signaling pathway and bone metabolism. The results provide new insight into genetic mechanisms of variability in BMD, and a better understanding of the genetic underpinnings of clinical comorbidity. ? 2015 Reppe et al.

Objective: To obtain insight into the quality of community pharmacy services from the perspectives of mental health consumers and carers. Methods: A computer-assisted telephone interview was used to gauge perceptions of pharmacy service using frameworks of service quality and patient-centred care. A convenience sample of 210 consumers and carers from three Australian states completed an interview comprising rating scales, multiple choice checklists and open-ended questions to explore their experience of pharmacy services. Results: Participants were consumers experiencing on-going mental health condition(s) (n = 172), carers for someone who experienced a mental health condition (n = 15) or both (n = 23). For 60% of participants, medicines were dispensed within ten minutes of arriving at the pharmacy, and 36% received verbal advice. The majority of participants were not asked by pharmacy staff whether they experienced side-effects, and 60% reported rarely or never receiving written medicine information. However, the majority of participants reported that their expectations were met despite the absence of such services. Qualitative data showed that participants valued high-quality services that reflected patient-centred care, and they were inclined to engage with these services particularly if they perceived them as surpassing basic expectations. Discussion and conclusions: Participants clearly valued high-quality pharmacy service yet did not routinely expect it. When service exceeded expectations, community pharmacies were viewed as safe health-care spaces to seek advice on mental health and well-being. This study has positive implications for the role of pharmacists. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Community pharmacy; Consumer expectations; Mental health; Patient-centred care; Service quality,"adult; aged; Australia; caregiver; consumer attitude; female; human; interview; male; Mental Disorders; middle aged; organization and management; patient care; pharmacist; pharmacy; psychology; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Caregivers; Community Pharmacy Services; Consumer Behavior; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Patient-Centered Care; Pharmacists; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84955209234

Early engagement with mental health services and other community agencies could provide the substrate for reducing risk. Aim To evaluate the impact of implementing an assertive community treatment informed prison in-reach model of care (PMOC) on post-release engagement with community mental health services and on reoffending rates. Methods One hundred and eighty prisoners with SMI released from four prisons in the year before implementation of the PMOC were compared with 170 such prisoners released the year after its implementation. Results The assertive prison model of care was associated with more pre-release contacts with community mental health services and contacts with some social care agencies in some prisons. There were significantly more post-release community mental health service engagements after implementation of this model (Z = -2.388, p = 0.02). There was a trend towards reduction in reoffending rates after release from some of the prisons (Z = 1.82, p = 0.07). Conclusions and implications for practice Assertive community treatment applied to prisoners with mental health problems was superior to 'treatment as usual', but more work is needed to ensure that agencies will engage prisoners in pre-release care. The fact that the model showed some benefits in the absence of any increase in resources suggests that it may be the model per se that is effective.

The aim of this study was to develop a patient-reported outcome (PRO) tool to assess tophus burden in people with gout. Methods The responses from interviews with 25 people with tophaceous gout were used to generate items for a preliminary PRO tool. Following cognitive testing of each item, a preliminary 34-item questionnaire was administered to 103 people with tophaceous gout. Rasch analysis generated a 20-item Tophus Impact Questionnaire (TIQ-20). Test-retest reproducibility and construct validity of the TIQ-20 were assessed. Results The TIQ-20 responses fit the Rasch model and demonstrated unidimensionality, adequate precision, absence of differential item functioning and adequate person separation index. The TIQ-20 included items related to pain, activity limitation, footwear modification, participation, psychological impact and healthcare use due to tophi. In the 103 patients with tophaceous gout, floor effects were observed in 4.9% and ceiling effects in 1%. The TIQ-20 test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.76 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.85). All predicted correlations for construct validity testing were observed, including weak correlation with serum urate concentrations (r<0.30), moderate correlation with subcutaneous tophus count and dual energy CT urate volume (r=0.30-0.50), and stronger correlation with Health Assessment Questionnaire scores (r>0.50). Conclusions We have developed a tophus-specific PRO in patients with tophaceous gout. The TIQ-20 demonstrates acceptable psychometric properties. Initial results show internal, face and construct validity, reproducibility and feasibility.

New Zealand has an increasing need for primary and preventive health care to reduce the burden of non-communicable disease. AIM: To review the recent evidence of effectiveness of dietetic intervention in primary health care on health and wider economic outcomes. Health benefits and cost benefits of employing dietitians to perform nutrition intervention in the primary health care setting are evaluated in the areas of obesity in conjunction with diabetes and cardiovascular disease, and malnutrition in older adults. METHODS: An electronic literature search of four scientific databases, websites of major dietetic associations and high-impact nutrition and dietetic journals was conducted. Randomised controlled trials and non-randomised studies conducted from 2000 to 2014 were included. RESULTS: Dietetic intervention demonstrates statistically and clinically significant impacts on health outcomes in the areas of obesity, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and malnutrition in older adults, when compared to usual care. Dietitians working in primary health care can also have significant economic benefits, potentially saving the health care system NZ$5.50–$99 for every NZ$1 spent on dietetic intervention. DISCUSSION: New Zealand must look to new models of health care provision that are not only patient-centred but are also cost-effective. This review demonstrates that dietitians in primary health care can improve patients’ health and quality of life. Increasing the number of dietitians working in primary health care has the potential to make quality nutrition care accessible and affordable for more New Zealanders. ? 2015, Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners.

(MGDRx EyeBag?). Methods: In vitro evaluation: surface temperature profiles of activated eye masks and heated eye bags? (both n=10), were tracked every 10s until return to ambient temperature.Heat-transfer assessment: outer and inner eyelid temperature profiles throughout the eye mask and eye bag? treatment application period (10min) were investigated in triplicate. The devices were applied for 12 different time intervals in a randomised order, with a cool-down period in between to ensure ocular temperatures returned to baseline. Temperature measurements were taken before and immediately after each application. Results: In vitro evaluation: on profile, the eye bag? surface temperature peaked earlier (0±0s vs. 100±20s, p&lt;0.001), cooled more slowly and displayed less variability than the eye mask (all p&lt;0.05).Heat-transfer assessment: the eye bag? effected higher peak inner eyelid temperatures (38.1±0.4°C vs. 37.4±0.2°C, p=0.04), as well as larger inner eyelid temperature increases over the first 2min, and between 9 and 10min (all p&lt;0.05). Conclusions: The eye bag? surface temperature profile displayed greater uniformity and slower cooling than the eye mask, and was demonstrated to be significantly more effective in raising ocular temperatures than the eye mask, both statistically and clinically. This has implications for MGD treatment, where the melting points of meibomian secretions are likely to be higher with increasing disease severity. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Dry eye conditions; Eyelid temperature; Eyelid-warming therapy; Meibomian gland dysfunction; Warm compress therapy,"adult; Article; cooling; environmental temperature; ethnicity; eyelid warming therapy; heat transfer; human; human experiment; hyperthermic therapy; melting point; ophthalmological therapeutic device; priority journal; surface property; temperature sensitivity; warming; adolescent; body temperature; comparative study; devices; eyelid; Eyelid Diseases; heat; meibomian gland; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; thermography; thermotherapy; Adolescent; Body Temperature; Eyelid Diseases; Eyelids; Hot Temperature; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Meibomian Glands; Thermography",2-s2.0-84948714680

Dislocation within the first year after surgery is typically related to either surgical error or patient inattention to precautions, but the reasons for dislocation after the first year are often unclear, and whether ceramic bearings are associated with an increased or decreased likelihood of late dislocation is controversial. Questions/purposes: The purpose of this study was to use a national registry to assess whether the choice of bearings–metal-on-polyethylene (MoP), ceramic-on-polyethylene (CoP), ceramic-on-ceramic (CoC), or metal-on-metal (MoM)–is associated with differences in the risk of late dislocation. Methods: Data from primary THAs were extracted from the New Zealand Joint Registry over a 10-year period. The mean age of patients was 69?years (SD?±?12?years), and 53% were women. The median followup in this population was 7?years (range, 1–13?years). The surgical approach used was posterior in 66% of THAs, lateral in 29%, and anterior in 5%. The primary endpoint was late revision for dislocation with “late” defined as greater than 1?year postoperatively. A total of 73,386 hips were available for analysis: 65% MoP, 17% CoP, 10% CoC, and 7% MoM. In general, patients receiving CoC and MoM bearings were younger compared with patients receiving CoP and MoP bearings. Results: Four percent of the hips were revised (3130 THAs); 867 THAs were revised for dislocation. Four hundred seventy THAs were revised for dislocation after the first postoperative year. After adjusting for head size, age, and surgical approach, only CoP (hazard ratio [HR], 2.10; p?=?0.021) demonstrated a higher proportion of revision, whereas MoP did not (HR, 1.76; 95% p?=?0.075). There were no differences of revisions for dislocation in the CoC (HR, 1.60; p?=?0.092) and MoM cohorts (HR, 1.54; p?=?0.081). Conclusions: Dislocation is a common reason for revision after THA. The relationships between bearing materials and risk of revision for late dislocation remain controversial. This large registry study demonstrated that bearing surface had little association with the incidence of late dislocation. Future studies with longer followups should continue to investigate this question.

This can be derived non-invasively using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Changes in PWV during exercise may reveal further information on vascular pathology. However, most known CMR methods for quantifying PWV are currently unsuitable for exercise stress testing. Methods: A velocity-sensitive real-time acquisition and evaluation (RACE) pulse sequence was adapted to provide interleaved acquisition of two locations in the descending aorta (at the level of the pulmonary artery bifurcation and above the renal arteries) at 7.8 ms temporal resolution. An automated method was used to calculate the foot-to-foot transit time of the velocity pulse wave. The RACE method was validated against a standard gated phase contrast (STD) method in flexible tube phantoms using a pulsatile flow pump. The method was applied in 50 healthy volunteers (28 males) aged 22-75 years using a MR-compatible cycle ergometer to achieve moderate work rate (38 ± 22 W, with a 31 ± 12 bpm increase in heart rate) in the supine position. Central pulse pressures were estimated using a MR-compatible brachial device. Scan-rescan reproducibility was evaluated in nine volunteers. Results: Phantom PWV was 22 m/s (STD) vs. 26 ± 5 m/s (RACE) for a butyl rubber tube, and 5.5 vs. 6.1 ± 0.3 m/s for a latex rubber tube. In healthy volunteers PWV increased with age at both rest (R2 = 0.31 p &lt; 0.001) and exercise (R2 = 0.40, p &lt; 0.001). PWV was significantly increased at exercise relative to rest (0.71 ± 2.2 m/s, p = 0.04). Scan-rescan reproducibility at rest was -0.21 ± 0.68 m/s (n = 9). Conclusions: This study demonstrates the validity of CMR in the evaluation of PWV during exercise in healthy subjects. The results support the feasibility of using this method in evaluating of patients with systemic aortic disease. ? 2015 Roberts et al.",Aortic stiffness; Exercise stress test; Pulse wave velocity; Real time imaging,"butyl rubber; latex rubber; rubber; unclassified drug; adult; age; aged; aorta disease; aortic pulse wave velocity; arterial stiffness; Article; augmentation index; bicycle ergometry; blood flowmetry; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; controlled study; descending aorta; diastolic blood pressure; elasticity; female; heart ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart left ventricle mass; heart output; heart rate; heart stroke volume; human; human experiment; imaging and display; limit of quantitation; male; mean arterial pressure; normal human; phantom; priority journal; pulse pressure; pulse wave; real time acquisition and evaluation pulse sequence; reproducibility; standard gated phase contrast; supine position; systolic blood pressure; validation study; aorta; arterial stiffness; automation; cine magnetic resonance imaging; computer assisted diagnosis; cycling; devices; exercise test; feasibility study; imaging phantom; middle aged; physiology; predictive value; procedures; pulse wave; time factor; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aorta; Automation; Bicycling; Exercise Test; Feasibility Studies; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Heart Rate; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Male; Middle Aged; Phantoms, Imaging; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulse Wave Analysis; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Vascular Stiffness; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84943609053

Most climate-mortality research has focused on seasonal extremes during winter and summer when mortality is the highest, while relatively little attention has been paid to mortality during the transitional seasons of autumn and spring. The body acclimatizes to heat in the summer and cold in winter and readjusts through acclimatization during the transitions between the two during which time the body experiences the thermophysiological strain of readjustment. To better understand the influences of weather on mortality through the acclimatization process, the aim here is to examine the periods that link very cold and very warms seasons. The study uses the Acclimatization Thermal Strain Index (ATSI), which is a comparative measure of short-term thermophysiological impact on the body. ATSI centers on heat exchange with the body’s core via the respiratory system, which cannot be protected. The analysis is based on data for a major city in the climatic region of the Russian Far East characterized by very hot summers and extremely cold winters. The results show that although mortality peaks in winter (January) and is at its lowest in summer (August), there is not a smooth rise through autumn nor a smooth decline through spring. A secondary peak occurs in autumn (October) with a smaller jump in May. This suggests the acclimatization from warm-to-cold produces more thermophysiological strain than the transition from cold-to-warm. The study shows that ATSI is a useful metric for quantifying the extent to which biophysical adaptation plays a role in increased strain on the body during re-acclimatization and for this reason is a more appropriate climatic indictor than air temperature alone. The work gives useful bioclimatic information on risks involved in transitional seasons in regions characterized by climatic extremes. This could be handy in planning and managing health services to the public and measures that might be used to help mitigate impacts. ? 2015 by the authors, licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland..",Acclimatization; Acclimatization thermal strain index; Cold strain; Heat strain; Human bioclimate; Physiological adaptation; Seasonal mortality,"acclimation; adaptation; autumn; bioclimatology; climate effect; environmental stress; extreme event; mortality; respiratory disease; spring (season); acclimatization; air temperature; autumn; cold stress; Far East; heat exchange; human; latitude; mortality; respiratory system; season; spring; summer; weather; winter; adolescent; adult; adverse effects; age; aged; cause of death; child; cold; cold shock response; female; forecasting; heat; heat injury; infant; male; middle aged; mortality; newborn; preschool child; Russian Federation; season; sex difference; trends; very elderly; young adult; Acclimatization; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Child; Child, Preschool; Cold Temperature; Cold-Shock Response; Extreme Heat; Female; Forecasting; Heat Stress Disorders; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Russia; Seasons; Sex Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84949032757

String vessel formation contributes to vascular degeneration in Alzheimer disease. By comparing to age-matched control cases we have recently reported endothelial degeneration in brain capillaries of human Parkinson disease (PD). Objective: Current study evaluated changes of basement membrane of capillaries, string vessel formation and their association with astrocytes, blood-brain-barrier integrity and neuronal degeneration in PD. Methods: Brain tissue from human cases of PD and age-matched controls was used. Immunohistochemical staining for collagen IV,GFAP, NeuN, tyrosine hydroxylase, fibrinogen and Factor VIIIwas evaluated by image analysis in the substantia nigra, caudate nucleus and middle frontal gyrus. Results: While the basement-membrane-associated vessel density was similar between the two groups, the density of string vessels was significantly increased in the PD cases, particularly in the substantia nigra. Neuronal degeneration was found in all brain regions. Astrocytes and fibrinogen were increased in the caudate nuclei of PD cases compared with control cases. Conclusions: Endothelial degeneration and preservation of basement membrane result in an increase of string vessel formation in PD. The data may suggest a possible role for cerebral hypoperfusion in the neuronal degeneration characteristic of PD, which needs further investigation. Elevated astrocytosis in the caudate nucleus of PD cases could be associated with disruption of the blood-brain barrier in this brain region. ? 2015 IOS Press and the authors.

Current healthcare robot systems do not address healthcare workflows well and our goal is to provide distributed, heterogeneous multiple robot systems that are capable of integrating with healthcare workflows and are easy to modify when workflow requirements change. The proposed system consists of three subsystems: a receptionist robot system, a nurse assistant robot system, and a medical server. The roles of the receptionist robot and the nurse assistant robot are to do tasks to help the human receptionist and nurse. The healthcare robots upload and download patient information through the medical server and provide data summaries to human care givers via a web interface. We developed these healthcare robot systems based on our new robotic software framework, which is designed to easily integrate different programming frameworks, and minimize the impact of framework differences and new versions. We test the functionalities of each healthcare robot system, evaluate the robot-robot collaboration, and present a case study. ? 2015 IEEE.",,Computer programming; Health care; Nursing; Robotics; Robots; Healthcare facility; Hospital environment; Multiple robot system; Patient information; Programming framework; Receptionist robots; Robotic software frameworks; Workflow requirements; Robot programming,2-s2.0-84954065547

Samples were selected as a nested case-control study from the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) biobank in Auckland, New Zealand. Cervicovaginal swabs were collected at 20 weeks from women who were originally assessed as being at low risk of sPTB. Samples were analysed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Despite the low amount of biomass (16-23 mg), 112 compounds were detected. Statistical analysis showed no significant correlations with sPTB. Comparison of reported infection and plasma inflammatory markers from early pregnancy showed two inflammatory markers were correlated with reported infection, but no correlation with any compounds in the metabolite profile was observed. We hypothesise that the lack of biomarkers of sPTB in the cervicovaginal fluid metabolome is simply because it lacks such markers in early pregnancy. We propose alternative biofluids be investigated for markers of sPTB. Our results lead us to call for greater scrutiny of previously published metabolomic data relating to biomarkers of sPTB in cervicovaginal fluids, as the use of small, high risk, or late pregnancy cohorts may identify metabolite biomarkers that are irrelevant for predicting risk in normal populations. ? 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Biomarkers; Cervicovaginal; Metabolomics; Spontaneous preterm birth,biological marker; C reactive protein; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; gelatinase B; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; tumor necrosis factor receptor 1; autacoid; biological marker; adult; Article; body mass; cervical length measurement; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; ethnicity; female; first trimester pregnancy; human; mass fragmentography; maternal age; metabolite; metabolomics; pregnancy termination; premature labor; uterine cervix mucus; vagina bleeding; vagina candidiasis; case control study; extracellular fluid; gestational age; metabolism; metabolome; pregnancy; prematurity; procedures; risk factor; uterine cervix; vagina; Adult; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Cervix Uteri; Extracellular Fluid; Female; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Gestational Age; Humans; Inflammation Mediators; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Risk Factors; Vagina,2-s2.0-84947556348

Ensuring that patients receive the most appropriate combinations of medications (appropriate polypharmacy) is a significant challenge. The quality of evidence to support the effectiveness of interventions to improve appropriate polypharmacy is low. Systematic identification of mediators of behaviour change, using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF), provides a theoretically robust evidence base to inform intervention design. This study aimed to (1) identify key theoretical domains that were perceived to influence the prescribing and dispensing of appropriate polypharmacy to older patients by general practitioners (GPs) and community pharmacists, and (2) map domains to associated behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to include as components of an intervention to improve appropriate polypharmacy in older people in primary care. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with members of each healthcare professional (HCP) group using tailored topic guides based on TDF version 1 (12 domains). Questions covering each domain explored HCPs' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to ensuring the prescribing and dispensing of appropriate polypharmacy to older people. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. Data analysis involved the framework method and content analysis. Key domains were identified and mapped to BCTs based on established methods and discussion within the research team. Results: Thirty HCPs were interviewed (15 GPs, 15 pharmacists). Eight key domains were identified, perceived to influence prescribing and dispensing of appropriate polypharmacy: 'Skills', 'Beliefs about capabilities', 'Beliefs about consequences', 'Environmental context and resources', 'Memory, attention and decision processes', 'Social/professional role and identity', 'Social influences' and 'Behavioural regulation'. Following mapping, four BCTs were selected for inclusion in an intervention for GPs or pharmacists: 'Action planning', 'Prompts/cues', 'Modelling or demonstrating of behaviour' and 'Salience of consequences'. An additional BCT ('Social support or encouragement') was selected for inclusion in a community pharmacy-based intervention in order to address barriers relating to interprofessional working that were encountered by pharmacists. Conclusions: Selected BCTs will be operationalised in a theory-based intervention to improve appropriate polypharmacy for older people, to be delivered in GP practice and community pharmacy settings. Future research will involve development and feasibility testing of this intervention. ? 2015 Cadogan et al.",Behaviour change; Dispensing; Intervention; Polypharmacy; Prescribing; Qualitative; Theoretical Domains Framework,"adult; aged; attitude to health; clinical competence; environment; female; general practitioner; health personnel attitude; human; male; middle aged; organization and management; pharmacist; polypharmacy; primary health care; professional standard; psychological theory; psychology; self concept; social environment; social support; total quality management; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Environment; Female; General Practitioners; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pharmacists; Polypharmacy; Primary Health Care; Professional Role; Psychological Theory; Quality Improvement; Self Efficacy; Social Environment; Social Support",2-s2.0-84960100480

This study covered an intergenerational retrospective cohort of 26,561 Swedish mothers and their 26,561 first-born daughters. There was a 4-fold increase in obesity rates, which rose from 3.1% among women entering pregnancy in 1982-1988 to 12.3% among their daughters in 2000-2008 (p<0.0001) when entering pregnancy. The greater the maternal BMI, the greater the odds of overweight and/or obesity among daughters. Underweight mothers had half the odds of having an overweight or obese daughter in comparison to mothers of normal BMI (p<0.0001). In contrast, the odds ratio of obese mothers having obese daughters was 3.94 (p<0.0001). This study showed a strong association between maternal obesity and the risk of obesity among their first-born daughters. In addition, we observed a considerable increase in obesity rates across generations in mother-daughter pairs of Swedish women entering pregnancy. Thus, it is important to have preventative strategies in place to halt the worsening intergenerational cycle of obesity. ? 2015, Nature Publishing Group.

However, the literature assessing pain therapy for this procedure has not been systematically evaluated. Thus, optimal pain therapy for patients undergoing radical prostatectomy remains controversial. Methods: Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for studies assessing the effects of analgesic and anesthetic interventions on pain after radical prostatectomy. All searches were conducted in October 2012 and updated in June 2015. Results: Most treatments studied improved pain relief and/or reduced opioid requirements. However, there were significant differences in the study designs and the variables evaluated, precluding quantitative analysis and consensus recommendations. Conclusions: This systematic review reveals that there is a lack of evidence to develop an optimal pain management protocol in patients undergoing radical prostatectomy. Most studies assessed unimodal analgesic approaches rather than a multimodal technique. There is a need for more procedure-specific studies comparing pain and analgesic requirements for open and minimally invasive surgical procedures. Finally, while we wait for appropriate procedure specific evidence from publication of adequate studies assessing optimal pain management after radical prostatectomy, we propose a basic analgesic guideline. ? 2015 Joshi et al.",Multimodal analgesia; Pain; Postoperative; Radical prostatectomy,"acetylsalicylic acid; amantadine; belladonna alkaloid; buprenorphine; celecoxib; clonidine; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor; diclofenac; fentanyl; gabapentin; ketamine; lidocaine; lornoxicam; magnesium; melatonin; morphine; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; narcotic analgesic agent; nicotine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; oxybutynin; paracetamol; parecoxib; placebo; pregabalin; rofecoxib; ropivacaine; tiaprofenic acid; unindexed drug; analgesic agent; anesthetic agent; narcotic analgesic agent; analgesia; Article; clinical protocol; general anesthesia; human; minimally invasive surgery; postoperative pain; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; quantitative analysis; regional anesthesia; spinal anesthesia; systematic review; male; Pain, Postoperative; practice guideline; procedures; prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Analgesics; Analgesics, Opioid; Anesthetics; Humans; Male; Minimally Invasive Surgical Procedures; Pain, Postoperative; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84946202943

We hypothesized that information maximizing component analysis (IMCA), a supervised feature extraction method, can provide more efficient and sensitive indices of overall remodeling. Methods: IMCA was compared to linear discriminant analysis (LDA), both supervised methods, to extract the most discriminatory global shape changes associated with remodeling after MI. Finite element shape models from 300 patients with myocardial infarction from the DETERMINE study (age 31-86, mean age 63, 20% women) were compared with 1991 asymptomatic cases from the MESA study (age 44-84, mean age 62, 52% women) available from the Cardiac Atlas Project. IMCA and LDA were each used to identify a single mode of global remodeling best discriminating the two groups. Logistic regression was employed to determine the association between the remodeling index and MI. Goodness-of-fit results were compared against a baseline logistic model comprising standard clinical indices. Results: A single IMCA mode simultaneously describing end-diastolic and end-systolic shapes achieved best results (lowest Deviance, Akaike information criterionand Bayesian information criterion, and the largest area under thereceiver-operating-characteristiccurve). This mode provided a continuous scale where remodeling can be quantified and visualized, showing that MI patients tend to present larger size and more spherical shape, more bulging of the apex, and thinner wall thickness. Conclusions: IMCA enables better characterization of global remodeling than LDA, and can be used to quantify progression of disease and the effect of treatment.

Preeclampsia has dire consequences for both maternal and neonatal health: it is associated with 50,000 - 100,000 annual deaths globally, as well as serious fetal and neonatal morbidity and mortality, including increased risk of fetal growth restriction and still birth. Despite the severe health, social, and economic costs of preeclampsia, currently the only curative therapy is delivery of the baby and placenta, which itself carries the associated risks of premature birth. The lack of treatments for this condition is attributable to a number of causes, including but not limited to: a partial understanding of the complex pathophysiological mechanisms underlying this complex disease; an inability to sensitively predict women who will go on to develop the disease; and a paucity of robust animal models with which to test new treatments.Areas covered: Recently, progress has been made in identifying potential new therapeutic targets. This review will discuss in detail the evidence supporting further investigation of these targets, which include angiogenic factors, agents that increase vasodilation, anti-inflammatory drugs, substances that reduce oxidative stress, and statins.Expert opinion: New therapeutic targets have the potential to make a significant positive impact on maternal and neonatal health. It is exciting that a number of potential therapies are currently being investigated; however, it is also vital that basic research continues to identify potential mechanisms and targets, and that any potential therapy is thoroughly tested before progression to clinical trial. ? 2015 ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.",angiogenic factors; anti-inflammatory; melatonin; nitric oxide; oxidative stress; preeclampsia; sildenafil; statins; VEGF,"acetylsalicylic acid; angiogenic factor; anticoagulant agent; antiinflammatory agent; arginine; citrulline; endothelin 1; hydrogen sulfide; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; melatonin; nitric oxide; nitric oxide donor; pravastatin; sildenafil; vasculotropin; vitamin; drug targeting; human; immunomodulation; inflammation; maternal morbidity; nonhuman; oxidative stress; perinatal morbidity; perinatal mortality; preeclampsia; process optimization; Review; vasoconstriction; vasodilatation; animal; drug design; drug effects; female; molecularly targeted therapy; newborn; pathophysiology; Pre-Eclampsia; pregnancy; Animals; Drug Design; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Oxidative Stress; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy",2-s2.0-84947019020

Design, setting and participants: Management and outcomes are described for patients enrolled in the 2012 Australian and New Zealand SNAPSHOT ACS audit. Patients were stratified according to their presentation to hospitals with or without cardiac catheterisation facilities. Data linkage ascertained patient vital status 18 months after admission. Descriptive and Cox proportional hazards analyses determined predictors of outcomes, and were used to estimate the numbers of deaths that could be averted by improved application of evidence-based care. Main outcome measures: Mortality for ACS patients from admission to 18 months after admission. Results: Definite ACS patients presenting to catheterisation-capable (CC) hospitals (n = 1326) were more likely to undergo coronary angiography than those presenting to non-CC hospitals (n = 1031) (61.5% v 50.8%; P = 0.0001), receive timely reperfusion (for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients: 45.2% v 19.2%; P < 0.001), and be referred for cardiac rehabilitation (57% v 53%; P = 0.05). All-cause mortality over 18 months was highest for STEMI (16.2%) and non-STEMI (16.3%) patients, and lowest for those presenting with unstable angina (6.8%) and non-cardiac chest pain (4.8%; P < 0.0001 for trend). After adjustment for patient propensity to present to a CC hospital and patient risk, presentation to a CC hospital was associated with 21% (95% CI, 2%–37%) lower mortality than presentation to a non-CC hospital. This mortality difference was attenuated after adjusting for delivery of evidence-based care. Conclusion: In Australia and New Zealand, the availability of a catheterisation laboratory appears to have a significant impact on longterm mortality in ACS patients, which is still substantial. This mortality may be reduced by improvements in evidence-based care in both CC and non-CC hospitals. ? 2015 AMPCo Pty Ltd. Produced with Elsevier B.V.

Objective To date, the dependence of tDCS after-effects on I-wave recruitment has only been investigated in intrinsic hand muscles. In order to better understand the effects of tDCS across the upper limb, the present study examined I-wave recruitment and MEP modulation by a-tDCS or dual-hemisphere tDCS in muscles of the forearm (Extensor Carpi Radialis; ECR) and proximal upper limb (Biceps Brachii; BB). Methods We conducted a randomized double-blind study with 18 healthy adults. Each received anodal, dual-hemisphere, or sham tDCS over M1 in separate sessions (tDCS, 1 mA for 15 min). Results Linear regression analyzes showed a-tDCS modulated MEP size dependent on the latency difference in the ECR (P = 0.01) but not BB (P = 0.28). Individuals with small MEP latency differences showed the expected facilitation of ECR MEPs after a-tDCS, whereas those with large MEP latency differences had suppressed ECR MEPs after a-tDCS. This relationship was not present after dual-hemisphere or sham tDCS in either muscle (all P > 0.32). Conclusions I-wave recruitment can predict the after-effects of a-tDCS in the distal but not proximal upper limb. These findings provide further insight into the variability of tDCS after-effects, and the relationship between I-wave recruitment and putative mechanisms of tDCS. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Electrode montage; I-waves; MEP; Proximal; tDCS; TMS,"adult; arm muscle; Article; biceps brachii muscle; controlled study; double blind procedure; female; forearm; hand muscle; hemisphere; human; human experiment; latent period; male; neuromuscular facilitation; neuromuscular stimulator; normal human; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; stimulus response; transcranial direct current stimulation; waveform; electromyography; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; physiology; transcranial magnetic stimulation; upper limb; young adult; Adult; Double-Blind Method; Electromyography; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Humans; Male; Motor Cortex; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation; Upper Extremity; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84955628778

We investigated the association between a healthy Nordic diet and clinical diagnosis of cardiovascular disease. Objective: Our aim was first to examine the association between a healthy Nordic food index (wholegrain bread, oatmeal, apples/pears, root vegetables, cabbages and fish) and the incidence of overall cardiovascular disease (ischaemic heart disease, stroke, arrhythmia, thrombosis and hypertensive disease), and secondly to test for possible effect modification by smoking, body mass index (BMI), alcohol consumption and age. Methods: We conducted an analysis of data from the prospective Swedish Women's Lifestyle and Health cohort, including 43 310 women who completed a food frequency questionnaire in 1991-1992, and followed up until 31 December 2012 through Swedish registries. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models. Results: During follow-up, 8383 women developed cardiovascular disease. We found no association between the healthy Nordic food index and overall cardiovascular disease risk or any of the subgroups investigated. There was a statistically significant interaction with smoking status (P = 0.02), with a beneficial effect only amongst former smokers (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.94-0.99 per 1-point increment). Conclusion: The present results do not support an association between a healthy Nordic food index and risk of cardiovascular disease in Swedish women.

A major symptom of this pathology is the loss to the visual field in a peripheral to central pattern. Flavonoids are polyphenol compounds sourced from plants, commonly found in green tea, red wine and cocoa, and they have neuroprotective and antioxidant characteristics proposed to be advantageous within the context of glaucoma. Currently, the literature presents conflicting evidence regarding the effect of flavonoids on patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension; hence a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. Method: Databases included in our literature search were EMBASE (1980-present), MEDLINE Ovid, Alternative and Complementary Medicine Database (AMED), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5 (Review Manager) 5 software, version 5.3 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen). The primary outcomes were visual field mean deviation (MD) and intraocular pressure (IOP). Secondary outcomes were ocular blood flow and blood pressure (BP). Conclusion: Meta-analyses showed that flavonoids have a promising role in improving visual function in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension (OHT), and appear to play a part in both improving and slowing the progression of visual field loss. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Blood flow; Glaucoma; Intraocular pressure; Polyphenol; Visual field,flavonoid; flavonoid; blood flowmetry; blood pressure; closed angle glaucoma; drug effect; eye blood flow; human; intraocular hypertension; intraocular pressure; laser Doppler flowmetry; low tension glaucoma; meta analysis; open angle glaucoma; priority journal; retina ganglion cell; Review; risk assessment; vision; visual field; drug effects; glaucoma; Ocular Hypertension; pathophysiology; visual acuity; Blood Pressure; Flavonoids; Glaucoma; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Ocular Hypertension; Visual Acuity; Visual Fields,2-s2.0-84944352478

A thorough understanding of what controls macrophage activation will likely reveal new pathways that can be manipulated for therapeutic benefit. Live imaging fluorescent macrophages within transgenic zebrafish larvae has provided a valuable window to investigate macrophage behavior invivo. Here we describe the first transgenic zebrafish line that reports macrophage activation, as evidenced by induced expression of an immunoresponsive gene 1(irg1):EGFP transgene. When combined with existing reporter lines that constitutively mark macrophages, we reveal this unique transgenic line can be used to live image macrophage activation in response to the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide and xenografted human cancer cells.

In the US, over 65 million people have high blood pressure and a large proportion of these individuals are prescribed antihypertensive medications. Although large long-term clinical trials conducted in the last several decades have identified a number of effective antihypertensive treatments that reduce the risk of future clinical complications, responses to therapy and protection from cardiovascular events vary among individuals. Methods Using a genome-wide association study among 21,267 participants with pharmaceutically treated hypertension, we explored the hypothesis that genetic variants might influence or modify the effectiveness of common antihypertensive therapies on the risk ofmajor cardiovascular outcomes. The classes of drug treatments included angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. In the setting of the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium, each study performed array-based genome-wide genotyping, imputed to HapMap Phase II reference panels, and used additive genetic models in proportional hazards or logistic regressionmodels to evaluate drug-gene interactions for each of four therapeutic drug classes. We used meta-analysis to combine study-specific interaction estimates for approximately 2 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a discovery analysis among 15,375 European Ancestry participants (3,527 CVD cases) with targeted follow-up in a case-only study of 1,751 European Ancestry GenHAT participants as well as among 4,141 African-Americans (1,267 CVD cases). Results Although drug-SNP interactions were biologically plausible, exposures and outcomes were well measured, and power was sufficient to detect modest interactions, we did not identify any statistically significant interactions from the four antihypertensive therapy meta-analyses (Pinteraction > 5.0×10-8). Similarly, findings were null for meta-analyses restricted to 66 SNPs with significant main effects on coronary artery disease or blood pressure from large published genome-wide association studies (Pinteraction ? 0.01). Our results suggest that there are no major pharmacogenetic influences of common SNPs on the relationship between blood pressure medications and the risk of incident CVD.",,"antihypertensive agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; antihypertensive agent; adult; African American; aged; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; coronary artery disease; European; female; genetic association; genetic model; genetic variability; genotype; heart infarction; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; pharmacogenomics; single nucleotide polymorphism; sudden death; Cardiovascular Diseases; Caucasian; genetics; genome-wide association study; incidence; meta analysis; middle aged; single nucleotide polymorphism; treatment outcome; African Americans; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84950335587

Methods: Muscle samples from obese or obese T2DM donors were stored or processed into human primary skeletal muscle myotubes, which were treated for 6?h with a saturated (palmitic acid) or a monounsaturated (oleic acid) FA with or without a polyunsaturated FA (eicosapentaenoic acid: EPA). Real-time PCR analysis was used to determine mRNA expression. Results: Basal pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) mRNA expression in whole muscle samples from obese and T2DM subjects was increased compared to lean (P?<?0.05; n?=?13–20/group). In obese- and T2DM-derived myotubes, oleic acid treatment alone and in combination with EPA increased PDK4 mRNA expression compared to control (P?<?0.05; n?=?7/group), whereas palmitic acid alone and in combination with EPA only increased PDK4 mRNA in T2DM-derived myotubes compared to control (P?<?0.05; n?=?7/group). EPA alone did not alter mRNA expression of PDK4. Conclusions: These findings show that FAs induce the expression of PDK4 mRNA, which was increased in myotubes cultured from obese and T2DM donors.

We aim to find prevalence estimates of tinnitus that are representative of the New Zealand population. METHOD: We obtained data from random-digit dialled telephone surveys of households, conducted by Roy Morgan Research Limited between August, 2007, and July, 2013, for people aged ?14 years in New Zealand (n=69,976). As part of the survey, participants were asked whether they have had tinnitus in the last 12 months. The response options were “yes” or “no”. Estimates were standardised to the New Zealand population structure based on the 2013 national census. Sex, age and ethnic differences were explored. RESULTS: The overall weighted prevalence for any tinnitus was 6.0% in the total New Zealand population age ?14 years. Tinnitus was higher among males (6.5%) compared to females (5.5%). Males were 55% more likely to report tinnitus compared to females among young adults aged 14 to 24 years, while males were 32% more likely to report tinnitus compared to females among adults aged 50 to 64 years. Tinnitus prevalence increased with age, peaking at 13.5% for older adults aged ?65 years. Adults aged ?65 years are three times more likely to report tinnitus than people aged below 65 years. Tinnitus prevalence was highest among people identifying as European (7.05%) and lowest among people identifying as Asian (1.00%). CONCLUSION: This is the first nationally representative study of tinnitus prevalence in New Zealand and largest study sample internationally for tinnitus prevalence to date. Tinnitus is a public health problem affecting approximately 207,000 people in the New Zealand population aged ?14 years. This study has highlighted the importance of sex and age in defining a high-risk tinnitus population, but our knowledge falls short of profiling their ethnic and social-economic characteristics. ?

However, in many cases, it would bemore practical for interventions to be delivered after wounding. This preliminary study investigated whether a brief relaxation intervention could improve healing when administered either before or after skin damage produced by tape stripping in comparison to a control group. Methods: One hundred twenty-one healthy adults were randomized into one of three groups: A) relaxation prestripping group, b) relaxation poststripping group, or c) no relaxation. Participants completed measures of stress, fatigue, relaxation, and pain. Relaxation consisted of listening to 20 minutes of guided relaxation, whereas the control condition was quiet reading for 20 minutes. Skin barrier function was measured using transepidermal water loss at baseline, immediately after tape stripping and 25 minutes later. Results: Relaxation either before or after tape stripping improved skin barrier recovery compared with the control group (F(2,92) = 3.58, p = .032, partial η2 = 0.074). Participants who took part in the relaxation intervention were significantly more relaxed and reported greater reductions in pain than the control group did 25 minutes after tape stripping. Perceived stress over the last month was not significantly related to healing. Conclusions: This study showed that a relaxation intervention had a beneficial effect on skin barrier recovery regardless of whether the intervention was administered before or after wounding. Future research needs to replicate these findings in other wound types and in clinical settings, and investigate the biological mechanisms involved.

However, oral feeding intolerance remains one of the most common complications in patients with this disease. It often results in longer periods of hospitalization, increased treatment costs, increased risk of readmission, and reduced quality of life. The traditional practice involves keeping patients nil by mouth followed by gradual stepwise reintroduction of food. However, it does not have a solid evidence base and, hence, there is increasing interest in determining alternative strategies that may be beneficial in reducing the occurrence of oral feeding intolerance.

CKDu is characterized as slowly progressing, irreversible, and asymptomatic until late stages and, importantly, not attributed to diabetes, hypertension, or other known risk factors. It is postulated that the etiology of CKDu is multifactorial, involving genetic predisposition, nutritional and dehydration status, exposure to one or more environmental nephrotoxins, and lifestyle factors. The objective of this limited geochemical laboratory analysis was to determine the concentration of a suite of heavy metals and trace element nutrients in biological samples (human whole blood and hair) and environmental samples (drinking water, rice, soil, and freshwater fish) collected from two towns within the endemic NCP region in 2012 and 2013. This broad panel, metallomics/mineralomics approach was used to shed light on potential geochemical risk factors associated with CKDu. Based on prior literature documentation of potential nephrotoxins that may play a role in the genesis and progression of CKDu, heavy metals and fluoride were selected for analysis. The geochemical concentrations in biological and environmental media areas were quantified. Basic statistical measurements were subsequently used to compare media against applicable benchmark values, such as US soil screening levels. Cadmium, lead, and mercury were detected at concentrations exceeding US reference values in many of the biological samples, suggesting that study participants are subjected to chronic, low-level exposure to these elements. Within the limited number of environmental media samples, arsenic was determined to exceed initial risk screening and background concentration values in soil, while data collected from drinking water samples reflected the unique hydrogeochemistry of the region, including the prevalence of hard or very hard water, and fluoride, iron, manganese, sodium, and lead exceeding applicable drinking water standards in some instances. Current literature suggests that the etiology of CKDu is likely multifactorial, with no single biological or hydrogeochemical parameter directly related to disease genesis and progression. This preliminary screening identified that specific constituents may be present above levels of concern, but does not compare results against specific kidney toxicity values or cumulative risk related to a multifactorial disease process. The data collected from this limited investigation are intended to be used in the subsequent study design of a comprehensive and multifactorial etiological study of CKDu risk factors that includes sample collection, individual surveys, and laboratory analyses to more fully evaluate the potential environmental, behavioral, genetic, and lifestyle risk factors associated with CKDu. ? 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Arsenic; Biological media; Cadmium; Chronic kidney disease; CKD of non-traditional causes; CKD of unknown etiology; CKDnT; CKDu; Environmental media; Fluoride; Geochemical; Lead; Mercury; Metals; Non-communicable disease; North Central Province; Regional laboratory analysis; Risk factors; Sri Lanka,"Analytical geochemistry; Arsenic; Cadmium; Diagnosis; Exploratory geochemistry; Factor analysis; Fluorine compounds; Heavy metals; Hydrochemistry; Laboratories; Lead; Mercury (metal); Metal analysis; Metals; Potable water; Risk assessment; Screening; Soils; Trace elements; Biological media; Chronic kidney disease; CKD of unknown etiology; CKDnT; CKDu; Environmental media; Fluoride; Geochemical; Laboratory analysis; Non-communicable disease; Non-traditional; North Central Province; Risk factors; Sri Lanka; Risk analysis; drinking water; heavy metal; trace element; drinking water; heavy metal; soil pollutant; trace element; water pollutant; arsenic; cadmium; concentration (composition); disease; etiology; fluoride; health risk; lead; public health; risk factor; adult; analytic method; Article; biochemical analysis; blood sampling; chronic kidney disease; chronic kidney disease of unknown etiology; controlled study; disease course; endemic disease; environmental factor; food analysis; freshwater fish; geochemistry; hair analysis; human; laboratory test; nonhuman; nutrient; pathogenesis; rice; risk assessment; risk factor; rural area; soil analysis; Sri Lanka; analysis; animal; blood; chemically induced; chemistry; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; fish; food contamination; hair; male; metabolism; middle aged; Oryza; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; risk factor; soil pollutant; water pollutant; Sri Lanka; Adult; Animals; Drinking Water; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Fishes; Food Contamination; Hair; Humans; Male; Metals, Heavy; Middle Aged; Oryza; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Soil Pollutants; Sri Lanka; Trace Elements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",2-s2.0-84984918462

Methods: Cross-national qualitative research using a heuristic approach in the US, UK, Japan, Australia and New Zealand, supplemented by data from Canada, Denmark, the Netherlands and Singapore. In-depth interviews with 80 key informants (65 interviews) explored and compared factors in terms of barriers and enablers to reclassification of medicines in each country. Document analysis supplemented interview data. Results: Each country had a unique mix of enablers and barriers to reclassification. Enablers included government policy (particularly in UK), pharmacist-only scheduling (particularly in Australia and New Zealand) and large market size (particularly in the US and Europe). Local barriers included limited market potential in small countries, the cost of a reclassification (particularly in the US), competition from distributors of generic medicines, committee inconsistency and consumer behavior. UK had more enablers than barriers, whereas in Australia the opposite was true. Conclusions: Different factors limit or enable reclassification, affecting consumer access to medicines in different countries. For countries attempting to reduce barriers to reclassification, solutions may include garnering government support for reclassification, support and flexibility from the medicines regulator, having a pharmacy-only and/or pharmacist-only category, providing market exclusivity, ensuring best practice in pharmacy, and minimizing the cost and delays of reclassification. ?

Participants: Healthy men and women aged 60-75 (n=15) years, and young controls aged 20-25 years (n=15) matched for body mass index and insulin sensitivity based on the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance. Intervention: High protein mixed meal of complete food products. Measurements: Circulating amino acid concentrations were determined hourly before and for 5 hours after meal ingestion. Results: There was no difference between cohorts in postprandial appearance of non-essential amino acids, or area under the curve of any individual amino acid or amino acid class. However, older adults had higher baseline concentrations of aspartic acid, glutamic acid, glycine, ornithine, threonine and tyrosine and lower baseline concentrations of hydroxyproline, isoleucine, leucine, methionine and valine compared to younger adults. Younger adults showed peak essential (EAA) and branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) concentrations at 1 hour post meal while older adults’ peak EAA and BCAA concentration was at 3 hours. Similarly, peak total amino acid concentrations were at 3 hours in older adults. Conclusion: Older adults digested and absorbed the protein within a mixed meal more slowly than younger adults.

To examine and evaluate ocular biomechanical metrics and additionally derived corneal and orbital components using a noncontact Scheimpflug-based tonometer (CorVis ST) in a population of healthy eyes. METHODS. A total of 152 eyes of 152 participants were examined by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, corneal tomography, and the CorVis ST (CST). This determined the distribution of outputs from the CST, such as deformation amplitude (DA), and additionally derived parameters, including maximum corneal deformation (MCD), maximum orbital deformation (MOD), and corneal energy dissipation (CED). RESULTS. The mean age of participants was 35.88 6 13.8 years. Deformation amplitude significantly correlated with age (r = 0.24, P = 0.002) but not sex or ethnicity (P > 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant correlations between DA and age (r = 0.19, P = 0.006) and DA and IOP (r = -0.59, P < 0.001). Age correlated with MCD (r = 0.20, P = 0.01), MOD (r = 0.18, P = 0.03), and CED (r = 0.39, P < 0.001). Males had a lower MOD than females (0.24 vs. 0.26 mm, respectively, P = 0.01); however, there were no differences in MCD or CED between sexes (P > 0.05). There were no significant ifferences between ethnicities for MCD, MOD, and CED (P > 0.05). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed significant correlations between MCD and IOP (r = -0.65, P < 0.001), CED and age (r = 0.41, P < 0.001), CED and IOP (r = 0.28, P = 0.001), and between CED and central corneal thickness (CCT) (r = -0.36, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. The isolation of the corneal component (MCD) should be used when analyzing deformation characteristics in diseases that only affect the cornea.

This study investigated the expression of B and T lymphocyte markers by the CD45+ population, and the expression of Thy-1, a marker of thymocyte progenitors, which have the ability to give rise to both B and T cells. Methods Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed on proliferating and involuted IHs for the expression of CD45, CD3, CD20, CD79a, Thy-1 and CD34. The presence of mRNA corresponding to CD45, CD3G, CD20 and Thy-1 was confirmed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in snap-frozen IH tissues. Cell counting of 3,3-diaminobenzidine IHCstained slides was performed on CD45+ only cells and dually stained CD45+/CD3+ cells or CD45+/CD20+ cells and analysed statistically. In situ hybridisation and mass spectrometry were also performed to confirm the presence and abundance of Thy-1, respectively. Results IHC staining showed a subpopulation of CD45+ interstitial cells that expressed the T lymphocyte marker, CD3, and another subpopulation that expressed the B lymphocyte marker, CD20, in proliferating and diminished in involuted IHs.

Adult patient-focused guidelines (British Thoracic Society 2003 and 2010) introduced aspiration as first-line intervention for primary spontaneous pneumothorax (PSP) and small secondary spontaneous pneumothoraces (SSP). Paediatric practice is unclear, and evidence for aspiration success rates is urgently required to develop paediatric-specific recommendations. Methods Retrospective analysis of PSP and SSP management at nine paediatric emergency departments across Australia and New Zealand (2003-2010) to compare PSP and SSP management. Results 219 episodes of spontaneous pneumothorax occurred in 162 children (median age 15 years, 71% male); 155 PSP episodes in 120 children and 64 SSP episodes in 42 children. Intervention in PSP vs SSP episodes occurred in 55% (95% CI 47% to 62%) vs 70% (60% to 79%), p<0.05. An intercostal chest catheter (ICC) was used in 104/219 (47%) episodes. Aspiration was used in more PSP than in SSP episodes with interventions (27% (18% to 37%) vs 9% (3% to 21%), p<0.05). Aspiration success was 52% (33% to 70%) overall and not significantly different between PSP and SSP. Aspiration success was greater in small vs large pneumothoraces (80% (48% to 95%) vs 33% (14% to 61%), p=0.01). Small-bore ICCs were used in 40% of ICCs and usage increased during the study. Conclusions In this descriptive study of pneumothorax management, PSP and SSP management did not differ and ICC insertion was the continuing preferred intervention. Overall success of aspiration was lower than reported results for adults, although success was greater for small than for large pneumothoraces. Paediatric prospective studies are urgently required to determine optimal paediatric interventional management strategies.",,oxygen; adolescent; Article; asymptomatic disease; ataxia telangiectasia; Australia; bronchiolitis obliterans; catheter; childhood disease; clinical feature; conservative treatment; coughing; cystic adenomatoid malformation; dyspnea; emphysema; female; follow up; hospital discharge; human; intercostal chest catheter; length of stay; lung hydatid cyst; major clinical study; male; Marfan syndrome; multicenter study (topic); New Zealand; oxygen therapy; pleurectomy; pleurodesis; primary spontaneous pneumothorax; priority journal; retrospective study; secondary spontaneous pneumothorax; spontaneous pneumothorax; staphylococcal pneumonia; thorax pain; thorax tube; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; child; clinical trial; disease management; multicenter study; pneumothorax; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Australia; Child; Disease Management; Female; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Pneumothorax; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84942983660

However, there is a worldwide shortage of population data to inform understanding of non-fatal injury burden. An improved understanding of the pattern of recovery following trauma is needed to better estimate the burden of injury, guide provision of rehabilitation services and care to injured people, and inform guidelines for the monitoring and evaluation of disability outcomes. Objective To provide a comprehensive overview of patient outcomes and experiences in the first 5 years after serious injury. Design This is a population-based, nested prospective cohort study using quantitative data methods, supplemented by a qualitative study of a seriously injured participant sample. Participants All 2547 paediatric and adult major trauma patients captured by the Victorian State Trauma Registry with a date of injury from 1 July 2011 to 30 June 2012 who survived to hospital discharge and did not opt-off from the registry. Analysis To analyse the quantitative data and identify factors that predict poor or good outcome, whether there is change over time, differences in rates of recovery and change between key participant subgroups, multilevel mixed effects regression models will be fitted. To analyse the qualitative data, thematic analysis will be used to identify important themes and the relationships between themes. Contribution to the field The results of this project have the potential to inform clinical decisions and public health policy, which can reduce the burden of non-fatal injury and improve the lives of people living with the consequences of severe injury. ? 2015 BMJ Publishing Group.

In the case of wind farms, factors contributing to noise annoyance have been theorised to include wind turbine sound characteristics, the noise sensitivity of residents, and contextual aspects, such as receiving information creating negative expectations about sound exposure. Objective: The experimental aim was to assess whether receiving positive or negative expectations about wind farm sound would differentially influence annoyance reactions during exposure to wind farm sound, and also influence associations between perceived noise sensitivity and noise annoyance. Method: Sixty volunteers were randomly assigned to receive either negative or positive expectations about wind farm sound. Participants in the negative expectation group viewed a presentation which incorporated internet material indicating that exposure to wind turbine sound, particularly infrasound, might present a health risk. Positive expectation participants viewed a DVD which framed wind farm sound positively and included internet information about the health benefits of infrasound exposure. Participants were then simultaneously exposed to sub-audible infrasound and audible wind farm sound during two 7 min exposure sessions, during which they assessed their experience of annoyance. Results: Positive expectation participants were significantly less annoyed than negative expectation participants, while noise sensitivity only predicted annoyance in the negative group. Conclusion: Findings suggest accessing negative information about sound is likely to trigger annoyance, particularly in noise sensitive people and, importantly, portraying sound positively may reduce annoyance reactions, even in noise sensitive individuals. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Environmental noise annoyance; Expectations; Noise sensitivity; Wind farms,experimental study; health risk; noise; psychology; public health; sound propagation; symptom; wind farm; wind turbine; World Wide Web; annoyance; Article; environmental noise annoyance; expectation; experience; female; health; health hazard; human; information; Internet; male; noise; priority journal; sound; wind; wind farm sound; affect; pollution; Affect; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Noise,2-s2.0-84941287177

However, the term 'M?ori' can refer to a wide range of people of varying ethnic compositions and cultural identity. We present a statistical model identifying 6 distinct types, or 'M?ori Identity Signatures,' and estimate their proportion in the M?ori population. The model is tested using a Latent Profile Analysis of a national probability sample of 686 M?ori drawn from the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study. We identify 6 distinct signatures: Traditional Essentialists (22.6%), Traditional Inclusives (16%), High Moderates (31.7%), Low Moderates (18.7%), Spiritually Orientated (4.1%), and Disassociated (6.9%). These distinct Identity Signatures predicted variation in deprivation, age, mixed-ethnic affiliation, and religion. This research presents the first formal statistical model assessing how people's identity as M?ori is psychologically structured, documents the relative proportion of these different patterns of structures, and shows that these patterns reliably predict differences in core demographics. We identify a range of patterns of M?ori identity far more diverse than has been previously proposed based on qualitative data, and also show that the majority of M?ori fit a moderate or traditional identity pattern.

Methods: Objective environment, body size (body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC)), and sedentary time and physical activity data were collected from a random selection of 2033 adults aged 20-65 years living in 48 neighbourhoods across four New Zealand cities. Multilevel regression models were calculated for each comparison between body size outcome and built environment exposure. Results and Discussion: Street connectivity and neighborhood destination accessibility were significant predictors of body size (1 SDchange predicted a 1.27 to 1.41 % reduction in BMI and a 1.76 to 2.29 % reduction in WC). Significantrelationships were also observed for streetscape (1 SD change predicted a 1.33 % reduction in BMI) anddwelling density (1 SD change predicted a 1.97 % reduction in BMI). Mediation analyses revealed asignificant mediating effect of physical activity on the relationships between body size and street connectivity and neighbourhood destination accessibility (explaining between 10.4 and 14.6 % of the total effect). No significant mediating effect of sedentary behaviour was found. Findings from this cross-sectional study of a random selection of New Zealand adults are consistent with international research. Findings are limited to individual environment features only; conclusions cannot be drawn about the cumulative and combined effect of individual features on outcomes. Conclusions: Built environment features were associated with body size in the expected directions.

Hypoglycaemia can cause brain damage and death, and babies born at risk have an increased risk of developmental delay in later life. Treatment of hypoglycaemia usually involves additional feeding, often with infant formula, and admission to Neonatal Intensive Care for intravenous dextrose. This can be costly and inhibit the establishment of breast feeding. Prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia would be desirable, but there are currently no strategies, beyond early feeding, for prevention of neonatal hypoglycaemia. Buccal dextrose gel is safe and effective in treatment of hypoglycaemia. The aim of this trial is to determine whether 40 % dextrose gel given to babies at risk prevents neonatal hypoglycaemia and hence reduces admission to Neonatal Intensive Care. Methods/design: Design: Randomised, multicentre, placebo controlled trial. Inclusion criteria: Babies at risk of hypoglycaemia (preterm, infant of a diabetic, small or large), less than 1 h old, with no apparent indication for Neonatal Intensive Care Unit admission and mother intends to breastfeed. Trial entry & randomisation: Eligible babies of consenting parents will be allocated by online randomisation to the dextrose gel group or placebo group, using a study number and corresponding trial intervention pack. Study groups: Babies will receive a single dose of 0.5 ml/kg study gel at 1 h after birth; either 40 % dextrose gel (200 mg/kg) or 2 % hydroxymethylcellulose placebo. Gel will be massaged into the buccal mucosal and followed by a breast feed. Primary study outcome: Admission to Neonatal Intensive Care. Sample size: 2,129 babies are required to detect a decrease in admission to Neonatal Intensive Care from 10-6 % (two-sided alpha 0.05, 90 % power, 5 % drop-out rate). Discussion: This study will investigate whether admission to Neonatal Intensive Care can be prevented by prophylactic oral dextrose gel; a simple, cheap and painless intervention that requires no special expertise or equipment and hence is applicable in almost any birth setting.

Target CLAB Zero was a national campaign that ran from October 2011 to March 2013 across all New Zealand ICUs (intensive care units). The campaign aimed to reduce the national CLAB rate to less than one incident per 1,000 line days and to establish a national measurement system for CLAB. METHOD: We used Institute for Healthcare Improvement (IHI) Breakthrough Series methodology to structure the campaign. IHI bundles of care for catheter insertion and maintenance were implemented across 25 New Zealand ICUs. We collected monthly data on line days, CLAB infections and compliance with the bundles. Data were analysed using run charts. RESULTS: The rate of CLAB per 1,000 line days fell from 3.32 at baseline to an average of 0.28 between April 2012 and March 2013. In the final 3-month period, January to March 2013, average insertion bundle compliance was 80% and average maintenance bundle compliance was 75%. All ICUs participated in the collaborative. Over 90% of those invited attended all three national learning sessions and bi-monthly regional learning sessions. CONCLUSION: National collaboratives can effect improvement and shared learning in New Zealand. International evidence combined with New Zealand experience, a supportive methodology, partnership, clinical respect and an effective communication plan were keys to successful engagement. ?

Many types of animal models are used world-wide, with the most common being small laboratory animals, such as mice. However, rodents often do not faithfully replicate human disease, despite their predominant use in research. This discordancy is due in part to physiological differences, such as body size and longevity. In contrast, large animal models, including sheep, provide an alternative to mice for biomedical research due to their greater physiological parallels with humans. Completion of the full genome sequences of many species, and the advent of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies, means it is now feasible to screen large populations of domesticated animals for genetic variants that resemble human genetic diseases, and generate models that more accurately model rare human pathologies. In this review, we discuss the notion of using sheep as large animal models, and their advantages in modelling human genetic disease. We exemplify several existing naturally occurring ovine variants in genes that are orthologous to human disease genes, such as the Cln6 sheep model for Batten disease. These, and other sheep models, have contributed significantly to our understanding of the relevant human disease process, in addition to providing opportunities to trial new therapies in animals with similar body and organ size to humans. Therefore sheep are a significant species with respect to the modelling of rare genetic human disease, which we summarize in this review. ? 2015 Pinnapureddy et al.",DNA sequencing; genetic disease; human genome; Large animal model; ovine genome; sheep,"body size; Cln6 gene; Gaucher disease; gene; gene sequence; genetic disorder; genetic variability; genome analysis; human; longevity; Meckel syndrome; neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; ovine model; phenotype; rare disease; Review; Tay Sachs disease; animal; disease model; genetics; high throughput sequencing; sheep; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Phenotype; Rare Diseases; Sheep",2-s2.0-84940570535

Severity of voice problems, recovery time, days away from work, symptoms, health assistance, and voice education were also investigated. Results. Prevalence of self-reported vocal problems was 33.2% during their teaching career, 24.7% over the teaching year, and 13.2% on the day of the survey. Primary teachers (P < 0.001; odds ratio [OR] = 1.74; confidence interval [CI] = 1.33-2.40), females (P = 0.008; OR = 1.63; CI = 1.13-2.37), and those aged 51-60 years (P = 0.010; OR = 1.45; CI = 1.11-3.00) were more likely to report problems. Among teachers reporting voice problems during the year, 47% were moderate or severe; for 30%, voice recovery took more than 1 week. Approximately 28% stayed away from work 1-3 days owing to a vocal problem and 9% for more than 3 days. Women reported longer recovery times and more days away. Symptoms associated with voice problems (P < 0.001) were voice quality alteration (OR = 4.35; CI = 3.40-5.57), vocal effort (OR = 1.15; CI = 0.96-1.37), voice breaks (OR = 1.55; CI = 1.30-1.84), voice projection difficulty (OR = 1.25; CI = 1.04-1.50), and throat discomfort (OR = 1.22; CI = 1.02-1.47). Of the teachers reporting voice problems, only 22.5% consulted a health practitioner. Only 38% of the teachers with chronic voice problems visited an otolaryngologist. Higher hours of voice training/education were associated with fewer self-reported voice problems. Conclusions. Voice problems are of concern for NZ teachers, as has been reported for teachers in other countries. There is still limited awareness among teachers about vocal health, potential risks, and specialized health services for voice problems. ? 2015 The Voice Foundation.",Epidemiology; Hoarseness; Prevalence; Teachers; Voice disorder; Voice symptoms; Voice-related health seeking,"adult; aged; Article; disease association; disease severity; female; health survey; human; male; New Zealand; otolaryngologist; prevalence; self report; speech rehabilitation; symptomatology; teacher; teaching; throat disease; voice disorder; absenteeism; attitude to health; chi square distribution; convalescence; cross-sectional study; health care survey; medical leave; middle aged; Occupational Diseases; occupational health; odds ratio; pathophysiology; patient education; questionnaire; risk factor; severity of illness index; statistical model; time factor; university; voice; Voice Disorders; young adult; Absenteeism; Adult; Aged; Chi-Square Distribution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Faculty; Female; Health Care Surveys; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Health; Odds Ratio; Patient Education as Topic; Prevalence; Recovery of Function; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Sick Leave; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Voice Disorders; Voice Quality; Voice Training; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84941314418

Methods: We analysed the 2006-2011 national HIV behavioural surveillance data from YMSM who reported anal intercourse in four scenarios of partner type and sexual position: casual insertive, casual receptive, regular insertive and regular receptive. For each, respondents' condom use was classified as frequent (always/almost always) or otherwise, with associated factors identified with multivariate mixed-effect logistic regression. Habitual condom use across scenarios was examined using a latent variable technique that estimated the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results: Frequent condom use was reported for 63.6% of 5153 scenarios reported from 2412 YMSM. Frequent use increased from boyfriend to fuckbuddy to casual partners. Infrequent use was associated with online recruitment, Pacific ethnicity, less education, HIV positivity, sex with women, having ?20 sexual partners versus 1 and reporting insertive and receptive sexual positions. Frequent condom use was associated with having two to five sexual partners versus one and shorter regular partnerships. The ICC=0.865 indicated highly habitual patterns of use; habitual infrequent condom use was most prevalent with regular partners (53.3%) and habitual frequent condom use was most prevalent with casual partners (70.2%) and for either sexual position (50.5% and 49.1%). Conclusions: Habitual condom use among YMSM highlights the value of early, engaging and sustained condom promotion. Public health should provide better and more compelling condom education, training and promotion for YMSM.",,"adolescent; adult; anal intercourse; behavioral risk factor surveillance system; bisexual male; casual insertive; casual receptive; casual sex; concurrent sexual partnership; condom; condom use; controlled study; ethnicity; habitual condom use; homosexual male; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; male; men who have sex with men; New Zealand; normal human; prevalence; priority journal; regular insertive; regular receptive; Review; sexual behavior; sexual position; attitude to health; bisexuality; health promotion; health survey; male homosexuality; psychology; sexual behavior; sexuality; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; utilization; young adult; Bisexuality; Condoms; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Promotion; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; New Zealand; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Sexual Behavior; Sexual Partners; Sexually Transmitted Diseases; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84940032722

One of the brain changes that occurs in HD is the expression of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a receptor protein capable of activating multiple signalling pathways by interacting with a range of ligands leading to either beneficial or harmful effects to the cell. Here, we demonstrate in human HD brains a high degree of co-localization of RAGE with its putative ligands S100B and N-carboxymethyllysine (CML) in the caudate nucleus (CN) and the subependymal layer (SEL). The level of co-staining for both RAGE-S100B and RAGE-CML was the highest in the astrocytes but was low in neurons and microglia. The immunostaining for RAGE, S100B and CML extended in a medio-lateral (SEL-CN) direction with increasing grade, such that any change in the expression and co-localization pattern between grades was less prominent in the lateral CN. Additionally, signalling molecules that are downstream of RAGE activation showed changes in their activation status in HD brains. A larger number of RAGE-positive astrocytic cells had NF-kB translocated to the nucleus and the level of phospho-ERK1/2 was also increased in HD brains. Interestingly, the level of mDia-1, that interacts directly with the cytoplasmic domain of RAGE, decreased in HD. Overall, the results suggest a correlation between the functions of RAGE and the HD pathology, but the influence of RAGE on astrocytes and the impact of this on HD progression requires further study. ? 2015 International Society for Neurochemistry.",astrocytes; Huntington's disease; N-carboxymethyllysine; receptor for advanced glycation end products; S100B,"6 n carboxymethyllysine; advanced glycation end product; advanced glycation end product receptor; brain protein; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; ligand; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; n carboxymethyllysine; protein mDia 1; protein S100B; unclassified drug; advanced glycosylation end-product receptor; DIAPH1 protein, human; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; immunoglobulin receptor; lysine; N(6)-carboxymethyllysine; nerve protein; protein S100B; S100B protein, human; signal transducing adaptor protein; Article; astrocyte; caudate nucleus; cell nucleus; controlled study; corpus striatum; cytoplasm; disease course; enzyme phosphorylation; human; human cell; human tissue; Huntington chorea; immunohistochemistry; intracellular transport; microglia; priority journal; protein carbohydrate interaction; protein domain; protein expression; protein localization; subventricular zone; aged; analogs and derivatives; astrocyte; corpus striatum; ependyma; female; Huntington chorea; male; metabolism; middle aged; nerve cell; pathology; severity of illness index; signal transduction; very elderly; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Astrocytes; Corpus Striatum; Ependyma; Female; Humans; Huntington Disease; Lysine; Male; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Microglia; Middle Aged; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Neurons; NF-kappa B; Receptors, Immunologic; S100 Calcium Binding Protein beta Subunit; Severity of Illness Index",2-s2.0-84939000082

While deregulated glutamate pathways impact oncogenicity in some cancers, the role of glutamate and NMDARs in megakaryocytic malignancies remains unknown. The aim of this study was to determine if NMDARs participate in Ca2+responses in leukemic megakaryoblasts and if so, whether modulating NMDAR activity could influence cell growth. Three human cell lines, Meg-01, Set-2 and K-562 were used as models of leukemic megakaryoblasts. NMDAR components were examined in leukemic cells and human bone marrow, including in megakaryocytic disease. Well-established NMDAR modulators (agonists and antagonists) were employed to determine NMDAR effects on Ca2+flux, cell viability, proliferation and differentiation. Leukemic megakaryoblasts contained combinations of NMDAR subunits that differed from normal bone marrow and the brain. NMDAR agonists facilitated Ca2+entry into Meg-01 cells, amplified Ca2+responses to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and promoted growth of Meg-01, Set-2 and K-562 cells. Low concentrations of NMDAR inhibitors (riluzole, memantine, MK-801 and AP5; 5-100μM) were weakly cytotoxic but mainly reduced cell numbers by suppressing proliferation. The use-dependent NMDAR inhibitor, memantine (100μM), reduced numbers and proliferation of Meg-01 cells to less than 20% of controls (IC5020μM and 36μM, respectively). In the presence of NMDAR inhibitors cells acquired morphologic and immunophenotypic features of megakaryocytic differentiation.In conclusion, NMDARs provide a novel pathway for Ca2+entry into leukemic megakaryoblasts that supports cell proliferation but not differentiation. NMDAR inhibitors counteract these effects, suggesting a novel opportunity to modulate growth of leukemic megakaryoblasts. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Blood; Cancer; Leukemia; Megakaryocyte; Memantine; N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor,"calcium; glutamic acid; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; acute megakaryocytic leukemia; calcium signaling; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; female; genetics; human; K-562 cell line; male; metabolism; pathology; Calcium; Calcium Signaling; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Female; Glutamic Acid; Humans; K562 Cells; Leukemia, Megakaryoblastic, Acute; Male; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate",2-s2.0-84934435067

In this study, we aimed to assess whether birth order was associated with height and BMI in a large cohort of Swedish women. Methods Information was obtained from antenatal clinic records from the Swedish National Birth Register over 20 years (1991-2009). Maternal anthropometric data early in pregnancy (at approximately 10-12 weeks of gestation) were analysed on 13 406 pairs of sisters who were either first-born or second-born (n=26 812). Results Early in pregnancy, first-born women were of BMI that was 0.57 kg/m2 (2.4%) greater than their second-born sisters (p &lt; 0.0001). In addition, first-borns had greater odds of being overweight (OR 1.29; p &lt; 0.0001) or obese (OR 1.40; p &lt; 0.0001) than secondborns. First-borns were also negligibly taller (+1.2 mm) than their second-born sisters.

A relatively small percentage of extremely low birthweight babies suffer from severe neurological disability; however, up to 50 % experience some neurodevelopmental or learning disability in childhood. Current international consensus is that increased protein intake in the neonatal period improves both neurodevelopment and growth, but the quantum of protein required is not known. This trial aims to assess whether providing an extra 1 to 2 g.kg-1.d-1 protein in the first 5 days after birth will improve neurodevelopmental outcomes and growth in extremely low birthweight babies. Methods/Design: The ProVIDe study is a multicentre, two-arm, double-blind, parallel, randomised, controlled trial. In addition to standard intravenous nutrition, 430 babies with a birthweight of less than 1000 g who have an umbilical arterial line in situ will be randomised in 1:1 ratio to receive either an amino acid solution (TrophAmine?) or placebo (saline) administered through the umbilical arterial catheter for the first 5 days. Exclusion criteria are admission to neonatal intensive care more than 24 h after birth; multiple births of more than 2 babies; known chromosomal or genetic abnormality, or congenital disorder affecting growth; inborn error of metabolism, and in danger of imminent death. Primary outcome: Survival free from neurodevelopmental disability at 2 years' corrected age, where neurodevelopmental disability is defined as cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, developmental delay (standardised score more than 1 SD below the mean on the cognitive, language or motor subscales of the Bayley Scales of Infant Development Edition 3), or Gross Motor Function Classification System score ?1. Secondary outcomes: Growth, from birth to 36 weeks' corrected gestational age, at neonatal intensive care discharge and at 2 years' corrected age; body composition at 36 to 42 weeks' corrected postmenstrual age and at 2 years' corrected age; neonatal morbidity, including length of stay; nutritional intake. Discussion: This trial will provide the first direct evidence of the effects of giving preterm babies a higher intake of intravenous protein in the first week after birth on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years corrected age.

Methods: A multi-state life table model was constructed using inputs from the Brain Injury Outcomes New Zealand in the Community study for the first-ever incidence of TBI in a lifetime and its severity distribution, from the NZ Ministry of Health's Mortality Collection for the data on TBI mortality and from Statistics of NZ for the population data. The modeled estimate of prevalence was combined with the disability weights for TBI (by stage and severity level) from the Global Burden of Disease 2010 study to obtain estimates of health loss (DALYs) for TBI. Results: Approximately, 11,300 first-ever incident TBIs occurred in NZ during 2010, with 527,000 New Zealanders estimated to have ever experienced a TBI (prevalent cases). The estimated 20,300 DALYs attributable to TBI accounted for 27% of total injury-related health loss and 2.4% of DALYs from all causes. Of the total DALYs attributable to TBI, 71% resulted from fatal injuries. However, nonfatal outcomes accounted for a substantial share of the burden (29%) with mild TBI making the greater contribution of non-fatal outcomes (56%). Conclusions: The burden of TBI in NZ is substantial, and mild TBI contributes to a major part of non-fatal outcomes. ? 2015 S.

This is partly due to ongoing neural inhibition that prevents the central nervous system from fully activating the quadriceps, a process known as arthrogenic muscle inhibition (AMI). To investigate the mechanisms underlying AMI, this study explored the effects of experimental knee pain on lower limb corticospinal and motor cortex excitability. Methods: Twenty-four healthy volunteers participated in this study. In experiment 1, experimental knee pain was induced by the injection of hypertonic saline into the infrapatellar fat pad (n = 18). In experiment 2, isotonic saline was injected into the fat pad as a non-painful control (n = 8). Pain intensity was measured on a 10-cm electronic visual analogue scale. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and electromyography were used to measure lower limb motor-evoked potential amplitude and short-interval intracortical inhibition before and after the injection. Results: The peak VAS score following hypertonic saline (5.0 ± 0.5 cm) was higher than after isotonic saline (p <0.001). Compared with baseline, there was a significant increase in vastus lateralis (p = 0.02) and vastus medialis motor-evoked potential amplitude (p = 0.02) during experimental knee pain that was not apparent during the control condition.

Both of these beverage formats have been increasing as a percentage of the westernized diet over the past 20 years, and both have contributed significantly to an increase in energy consumed in liquid form. Data from epidemiology and intervention studies however have long been contradictory, despite mechanistic evidence pointing towards poor compensation for addition of “liquid” energy from these two sources into the diet providing a strong rational for the balance to be tipped towards weight gain. Regulatory and government intervention has been increasing globally, particularly with respect to intake of SSBs in children. This narrative review presents evidence which both supports and refutes the link between alcohol and carbohydrate-containing liquids and the regulation of body weight, and investigates mechanisms which may underpin any relationship between increased beverage consumption and increased energy intake, body weight and adiposity. ? 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Alcoholic beverages; Body weight; Obesity; Sugar-sweetened beverages,"alcohol consumption; alcohol oxidation; alcoholic beverage; beverage; body mass; body weight; caloric intake; energy balance; energy consumption; energy expenditure; food intake; human; milk; obesity; prevalence; Review; Western diet; adverse effects; drinking behavior; feeding behavior; obesity; observational study; Overweight; randomized controlled trial (topic); weight gain; nutritive sweetener; Alcohol Drinking; Beverages; Diet, Western; Energy Intake; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Nutritive Sweeteners; Obesity; Observational Studies as Topic; Overweight; Prevalence; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Weight Gain",2-s2.0-84940860779

In this paper, we employed novel microengineered membranes with regular pore size to investigate the effect of the membrane pore geometry on the fouling mechanisms during filtration of micron-sized particles. For particles larger than the membrane pore size, the fouling mechanism was pore blockage followed by the cake filtration, while pore narrowing was the dominant mechanism when particles were smaller than the membrane pore size. Filtration with the slotted pore membrane offers some interesting advantages comparing to the filtration with circular pores. The rate of flux decline was slower for the membrane with slotted pores compared with the membrane with circular pores since the initial particle deposition only covered a small fraction of the pores. It was also found that the flow resistance of the slotted pore membrane is much lower than the circular one because a slotted pore has a smaller perimeter than several circular pores with the same total surface area. We can conclude that by proper selection of membrane pore geometry, flux decline can be hindered while maintaining a high selectivity during microfiltration. These findings can be useful also for researchers who are using microfluidic platforms with integrated isopore filters for various applications such as stem cell enrichment, cancer cell isolation, blood fractionation and pathogen removal. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Filtration; Fouling; Isopore membrane; MEMS; Microfluidics,Filtration; Fouling; Membrane fouling; Membranes; MEMS; Microfluidics; Pore size; Stem cells; Commercial membranes; Fouling mechanisms; Membrane pore size; Microfluidic platforms; Micron-sized particles; Microstructural defects; Particle depositions; Total surface area; Microfiltration,2-s2.0-84941075409

However, problems such as contamination of fluids with bacteria, endotoxins and particulates have been associated with intravenous infusion therapy. Intravenous in-line filters claim to be an effective strategy for the removal of bacteria, endotoxins and particulates associated with intravenous therapy in adults and are increasingly being recommended for use in neonates. Objectives: To determine the effect of intravenous in-line filters on morbidity and mortality in neonates. Search methods: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. We searched the electronic databases MEDLINE (from 1966 to May, 2015), EMBASE (from 1980 to May, 2015), CINAHL (from 1982 to May 2015) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2015, Issue 5). We did not impose any language restrictions. Further searching included cross references, abstracts, conferences, symposia proceedings, expert informants and journal handsearching. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs that compared the use of intravenous in-line filters with placebo or nothing in neonates. Data collection and analysis: We followed the procedures of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group throughout. We checked titles and abstracts identified from the search. We obtained the full text of all studies of possible relevance. We independently assessed the trials for their methodological quality and subsequent inclusion in the review. We contacted authors for further information as needed. Statistical analysis followed the procedures of the Cochrane Neonatal Review Group. Main results: There were four eligible studies that recruited a total of 704 neonates. This review of low to very low quality evidence found that the use of in-line filters compared with unfiltered fluids for intravenous infusion had no statistically significant difference in effectiveness on overall mortality (typical RR 0.87, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.47; typical RD -0.01, 95% CI -0.06 to 0.04; two studies, 530 infants), proven and suspect septicaemia (typical RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.27; typical RD -0.02, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.04; two studies, 530 infants), or other secondary outcomes (including local phlebitis and thrombus, necrotising enterocolitis, duration of cannula patency, length of stay in hospital, number of catheters inserted and financial costs).

Understanding the contributory factors to completed suicide is essential to inform the development of effective suicide risk assessment and management. The aim of this study is to synthesise the findings in studies that used coroner or medical examiner records to determine these contributory factors. Methods The databases of Scopus (from 1960), MEDLINE (from 1946) and PsychINFO (from 1806) were searched in August 2013, to identify studies that used coroner or medical examiner records for investigating the epidemiological, sociodemographic characteristics and clinical aspects of late-life suicide. Results In total, 25 studies were identified. There was a lack of standardisation of variables assessed between studies leading to incomplete datasets in some work. However, a diagnosis of depression was found in 33%, and depressive mood/symptoms in 47% of cases. About 55% had a physical health problem. Terminal illness was associated with a smaller proportion (7.1%) of the cases. Older people were more likely to have had contact with primary care rather than mental health services prior to suicide. Conclusions Despite their limitations, coroner and medical examiner records provide an opportunity for examining suicide epidemiology. Targeting primary care providers where late-life depression and physical illness can be detected and treated is a potential strategy to address late-life suicide.

However, the underlying mechanisms involved remain unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the molecular pathways that are involved in HDAC1-mediated metastatic activities in gastric cancer cells. First we used a microRNA (miRNA or miR) microarray to screen potential miRNAs whose expression can be altered by HDAC1 depletion. Of these miRNAs, miR-34a is important as it is often inactivated in cancer cells and acts as a tumor suppressor for various types of cancer. The reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results confirmed that miR-34a was upregulated by HDAC1 knockdown. Cells depleted of HDAC1 had lower abilities to migrate, invade and adhere, which were restored by a miR-34a antagomiR. Depletion of HDAC1 also resulted in impaired microfilaments and microtubules, while co-transfection of the miR-34a antagomiR attenuated these changes in the cellular cytoskeleton. The HDAC1/miR-34a axis regulated the expression and activation of CD44 and its downstream factors including Bcl-2, Ras homolog family member A (RhoA), LIM domain kinase 1 (LIMK-1) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2. The latter three proteins were responsible for the organization of tubulin and actin cytoskeleton and the formation of cellular pseudopodia. In conclusion, results of the present study indicated that HDAC1 depletion inhibits the metastatic abilities of gastric cancer cells by regulating the miRNA-34a/CD44 pathway, which may be a potential target for the treatment of gastric cancer. ? 2015, Spandidos Publications.

Interventions used to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant can be pharmacological (antibiotics) or non-pharmacological (cranberry products, acupuncture, probiotics and behavioural modifications). So far little is known about the best way to prevent RUTI in pregnant women. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions for preventing RUTI in pregnant women. The primary maternal outcomes were RUTI before birth (variously defined) and preterm birth (before 37 weeks). The primary infant outcomes were small-for-gestational age and total mortality. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (20 May 2015) and reference lists of retrieved articles. Selection criteria: Published, unpublished and ongoing randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-RCTs, clustered-randomised trials and abstracts of any intervention (pharmacological and non-pharmacological) for preventing RUTI during pregnancy (compared with another intervention, placebo or with usual care). Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion and risk of bias, extracted data and checked them for accuracy. Main results: The review included one trial involving 200 women and was at moderate to high risk of bias.The trial compared a daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance (regular clinic visit, urine cultures and antibiotics when a positive culture was found) with close surveillance only. No significant differences were found for the primary outcomes: recurrent pyelonephritis (risk ratio (RR) 0.89, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.31 to 2.53; one study, 167 women), RUTI before birth (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.06 to 1.38; one study, 167 women), and preterm birth (before 37 weeks) (RR 1.18, 95% CI 0.42 to 3.35; one study, 147 women). The overall quality of evidence for these outcomes as assessed using GRADE was very low. There were no significant differences between the two comparison groups for any of the following secondary outcomes, birthweight less than 2500 (g) (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.53 to 7.80; one study, 147 infants), birthweight (mean difference (MD) -113.00, 95% CI -327.20 to 101.20; one study, 147 infants), five-minute Apgar score less than seven (RR 2.03, 95% CI 0.19 to 21.87; one study, 147 infants) and miscarriages (RR 3.11, 95% CI 0.33 to 29.29; one study, 167 women). The evidence for these secondary outcomes was also of very low quality. The incidence of asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) (at least 103 colonies per mL) (secondary outcome), only reported in women with a clinic attendance rate of more than 90% (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.89; one study, 102 women), was significantly reduced in women who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. Data on total mortality and small-for-gestational-age babies were not reported. Authors' conclusions: A daily dose of nitrofurantoin and close surveillance has not been shown to prevent RUTI compared with close surveillance alone. A significant reduction of ASB was found in women with a high clinic attendance rate and who received nitrofurantoin and close surveillance. There was limited reporting of both primary and secondary outcomes for both women and infants. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the optimal intervention to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. Randomised controlled trials comparing different pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions are necessary to investigate potentially effective interventions to prevent RUTI in women who are pregnant. ? 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"nitrofurantoin; urinary tract antiinfective agent; Apgar score; asymptomatic bacteriuria; birth weight; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; disease surveillance; drug efficacy; gestational age; human; infant mortality; pregnancy; premature labor; priority journal; recurrent disease; Review; systematic review; urinary tract infection; bacteriuria; female; pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent disease; secondary prevention; Urinary Tract Infections; watchful waiting; Anti-Infective Agents, Urinary; Bacteriuria; Female; Humans; Nitrofurantoin; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Infectious; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Secondary Prevention; Urinary Tract Infections; Watchful Waiting",2-s2.0-85018201732

Over approximately two weeks these cells differentiate and traverse the thickness of the skin. The stage of differentiation is therefore reflected in the positions of cells within the tissue, providing a convenient axis along which to study the signaling events that occur in situ during keratinocyte terminal differentiation, over this extended two-week timescale. The canonical ERK-MAPK signaling cascade (Raf-1, MEK-1/2 and ERK-1/2) has been implicated in controlling diverse cellular behaviors, including proliferation and differentiation. While the molecular interactions involved in signal transduction through this cascade have been well characterized in cell culture experiments, our understanding of how this sequence of events unfolds to determine cell fate within a homeostatic tissue environment has not been fully characterized. Methods: We measured the abundance of total and phosphorylated ERK-MAPK signaling proteins within interfollicular keratinocytes in transverse cross-sections of human epidermis using immunofluorescence microscopy. To investigate these data we developed a mathematical model of the signaling cascade using a normalized-Hill differential equation formalism. Results: These data show coordinated variation in the abundance of phosphorylated ERK-MAPK components across the epidermis. Statistical analysis of these data shows that associations between phosphorylated ERK-MAPK components which correspond to canonical molecular interactions are dependent upon spatial position within the epidermis. The model demonstrates that the spatial profile of activation for ERK-MAPK signaling components across the epidermis may be maintained in a cell-autonomous fashion by an underlying spatial gradient in calcium signaling. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate an extended phospho-protein profile of ERK-MAPK signaling cascade components across the epidermis in situ, and statistical associations in these data indicate canonical ERK-MAPK interactions underlie this spatial profile of ERK-MAPK activation. Using mathematical modelling we have demonstrated that spatially varying calcium signaling components across the epidermis may be sufficient to maintain the spatial profile of ERK-MAPK signaling cascade components in a cell-autonomous manner. These findings may have significant implications for the wide range of cancer drugs which therapeutically target ERK-MAPK signaling components. ? 2015 Cursons et al.",,mitogen activated protein kinase; cytology; enzymology; epidermis; human; keratinocyte; metabolism; phosphorylation; signal transduction; Epidermis; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Humans; Keratinocytes; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphorylation,2-s2.0-84939251966

Simulation-based team training has been proposed to address this. We aimed to explore the feasibility of a simulation-based course for all members of the operating room (OR) team, and to evaluate its effectiveness. METHODS: Members of experienced OR teams were invited to participate in three simulated clinical events using an integrated surgical and anesthesia model. We collected information on costs, Behavioural Marker of Risk Index (BMRI) (a measure of team information sharing) and participants’ educational gains. RESULTS: We successfully recruited 20 full OR teams. Set up costs were NZ$50,000. Running costs per course were NZ$4,000, excluding staff. Most participants rated the course highly. BMRI improved significantly (P = 0.04) and thematic analysis identified educational gains for participants. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated feasibility of multidisciplinary simulation-based training for surgeons, anesthetists, nurses and anaesthetic technicians. The course showed evidence of participant learning and we obtained useful information on cost. There is considerable potential to extend this type of team-based simulation to improve the performance of OR teams and increase safety for surgical patients. ?

However, in real world clinical settings, these medicines are often used at irregular intervals by patients. Recent evidence suggests that the use of intermittent ICS, with treatment initiated at the time of early symptoms, may still have benefits for reducing the severity of an asthma exacerbation. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of intermittent ICS versus placebo in the management of children and adults diagnosed with, or suspected to have, symptoms of mild persistent asthma. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register of trials (CAGR), the ClinicalTrials.gov website and the World Health Organization (WHO) trials portal in March 2015. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that compared intermittent ICS versus placebo in children and adults with symptoms of persistent asthma. No co-interventions were permitted other than rescue relievers and oral corticosteroids used during exacerbations. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, methodological quality and extracted data. The primary efficacy outcome was the risk of asthma exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids and the primary safety outcome was serious adverse health events. Secondary outcomes included exacerbations, lung function tests, asthma control, adverse effects, and withdrawal rates. Quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE criteria. Main results: Six trials (representing 490 preschool children, 145 school-aged children and 240 adults) met the inclusion criteria. Study durations were 12 to 52 weeks. Results for preschool children were presented in a separate analysis as this represents a distinct clinical condition, not necessarily related to the development of long term asthma. There was a reduction in the risk of patients experiencing one or more exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids in older children (145 participants, odds ratio (OR) 0.57; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.29 to 1.12, low quality evidence) and adults with asthma (240 participants, OR 0.10; 95% CI 0.01 to 1.95, low quality evidence). These analyses were each based on the findings of a single study. No group difference was observed in the risk of serious adverse health events (385 participants; OR 1.00; 95% CI 0.14 to 7.25, moderate quality evidence). Compared to the placebo group, there was an insufficient number of participants to make firm conclusions whether the intermittent ICS group displayed any reduction in the rate of hospitalisations, day time and night time symptoms scores, or adverse events. Lung function tests reported by a single study favoured the use of ICS. There was no significant group difference in growth rate of children, or overall withdrawals. In preschool children with frequent wheezing episodes, the use of intermittent ICS at the onset of early symptoms reduced the likelihood of requiring rescue oral corticosteroids by half (490 participants; OR: 0.48; 95% CI 0.31 to 0.73, moderate quality evidence with minimal heterogeneity). Intermittent therapy was associated with fewer serious adverse events (439 participants; OR 0.42; 95% CI 0.17 to 1.02, low quality evidence). There was no significant difference in hospitalisations or in a single study measuring parent perceived quality of life. However, intermittent therapy was associated with improvements in both day time and night time symptoms. There was no increase in the rates of withdrawals, and overall and treatment-specific adverse events. Authors' conclusions: In children and adults with mild persistent asthma, two studies have shown that the use of intermittent ICS at the time of exacerbation reduced the chances of needing oral corticosteroids by half. This result is statistically significant if we assume that the effect size is the same for each study population (fixed effects model), but is not statistically significant when using a random effects model. However, the paucity of published evidence limits our conclusions towards the 'as-needed' use of this medication. The small number of studies and participants were the major reasons for downgrading the overall quality of the findings. A corresponding result was found in preschool children with wheeze. In this age group, an improvement in day time and night time asthma symptoms score and parental perceived quality of life of children similarly favoured the ICS group. However, there was no statistical difference in hospitalisation rates in any group. This treatment was not associated with any significant increase in adverse events. There was no growth suppression noted with the use of intermittent ICS in either preschool or school-aged children. Considering the limited number of available studies, we emphasise the need for more randomised controlled studies in order to confirm these findings. ? 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"corticosteroid; placebo; antiasthmatic agent; corticosteroid; asthma; corticosteroid therapy; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; hoarseness; human; incidence; lung function test; outcome assessment; pneumonia; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); rating scale; Review; risk reduction; scoring system; treatment duration; treatment outcome; wheezing; adolescent; adult; asthma; child; disease course; infant; inhalational drug administration; middle aged; oral drug administration; preschool child; Administration, Inhalation; Administration, Oral; Adolescent; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Anti-Asthmatic Agents; Asthma; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Progression; Humans; Infant; Middle Aged; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic",2-s2.0-85003051189

Here, we have identified a highly sophisticated allosteric response that allows complex control of the pathway for aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis. This response is mediated by an enzyme complex formed by two pathway enzymes: chorismate mutase (CM) and 3-deoxy-D-arabino- heptulosonate 7-phosphate synthase (DAH7PS). Whereas both enzymes are active in isolation, the catalytic activity of both enzymes is enhanced, and in particular that of the much smaller CM is greatly enhanced (by 120-fold), by formation of a heterooctameric complex between CM and DAH7PS. Moreover, on complex formation M. tuberculosis CM, which has no allosteric response on its own, acquires allosteric behavior to facilitate its own regulatory needs by directly appropriating and partly reconfiguring the allosteric machinery that provides a synergistic allosteric response in DAH7PS. Kinetic and analytical ultracentrifugation experiments demonstrate that allosteric binding of phenylalanine specifically promotes hetero-octameric complex dissociation,withconcomitantreductionofCMactivity.Together, DAH7PS and CM from M. tuberculosis provide exquisite control of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis, not only controlling flux into the start of the pathway, but also directing the pathway intermediate chorismate into either Phe/Tyr or Trp biosynthesis. ? 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

Methods The Coronial Services provided records of all suicide cases aged 65 years and over (n=225) between July 2007 and December 2012. We were able to determine whether there was a suicide note written in 212 cases. The content of 39 coroners/medical examiners' excerpts and 5 suicide notes was available for thematic analysis using a general inductive approach. Findings 88 (41.5%) older people left a suicide note. Logistic regression showed that female gender (OR=2.8, 95% CI=1.4-5.7, p=0.005) and Caucasian ethnicity (OR=13.7, 95% CI=1.7-111.0, p=0.014) are significantly associated with older people writing suicide notes. 33.3% of those who left a suicide note gave health-related reasons for their suicide and a significant proportion (73.3%) of them had underlying medical conditions. Another common theme is around people leaving specific instructions and wishes. Conclusions Apart from gender and ethnicity, suicide note writers are similar to non-writers on broad socio-demographic and clinical factors. Suicide notes indicated free will in and reasons for their suicide and emotional/farewell messages to their loved ones. Many documented poor quality of life or physical illness but the progression of these factors to suicide in older people should be further researched. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.

However, the role of multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) in controlling oxaliplatin membrane transport, in vivo handling, toxicity and therapeutic responses is unclear. In the current study, preparations of MRP2-expressing and control membrane vesicles, containing inside-out orientated vesicles, were used to directly characterise the membrane transport of oxaliplatin-derived platinum measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Oxaliplatin inhibited the ATP-dependent accumulation of the model MRP2 fluorescent probe, 5(6)-carboxy-2,′7′-dichlorofluorescein, in MRP2-expressing membrane vesicles. MRP2-expressing membrane vesicles accumulated up to 19-fold more platinum during their incubation with oxaliplatin and ATP as compared to control membrane vesicles and in the absence of ATP. The rate of ATP-dependent MRP2-mediated active transport of oxaliplatin-derived platinum increased non-linearly with increasing oxaliplatin exposure concentration, approaching a plateau value (Vmax) of 2680 pmol Pt/mg protein/10 minutes (95%CI, 2010 to 3360 pmol Pt/mg protein/10 minutes), with the half-maximal platinum accumulation rate (Km) at an oxaliplatin exposure concentration of 301 μM (95% CI, 163 to 438 μM), in accordance with Michaelis-Menten kinetics (r2 = 0.954). MRP2 inhibitors (myricetin and MK571) reduced the ATP-dependent accumulation of oxaliplatin-derived platinum in MRP2-expressing membrane vesicles in a concentration-dependent manner. To identify whether oxaliplatin, or perhaps a degradation product, was the likely substrate for this active transport, HPLC studies were undertaken showing that oxaliplatin degraded slowly in membrane vesicle incubation buffer containing chloride ions and glutathione, with approximately 95% remaining intact after a 10 minute incubation time and a degradation half-life of 2.24 hours (95%CI, 2.08 to 2.43 hours). In conclusion, MRP2 mediates the ATP-dependent active membrane transport of oxaliplatin-derived platinum. Intact oxaliplatin and its anionic monochloro oxalate ring-opened intermediate appear likely candidates as substrates for MRP2-mediated transport. ? 2015 Myint et al.

Previous studies established that superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometers detect the slow wave changes in the magnetoenterogram (MENG) noninvasively following induction of mesenteric ischemia in animal models. The purpose of this study was to assess functional physiological changes in the intestinal slow wave MENG of patients with chronic mesenteric ischemia. Pre- and postoperative studies were conducted on CMI patients using MENG and intraoperative recordings using invasive serosal electromyograms (EMG). Our preoperative MENG recordings showed that patients with CMI exhibited a significant decrease in intestinal slow wave frequency from 8.9 ± 0.3 cpm preprandial to 7.4 ± 0.1 cpm postprandial (P < 0.01) that was not observed in postoperative recordings (9.3 ± 0.2 cpm preprandial and 9.4 ± 0.4 cpm postprandial, P = 0.86). Intraoperative recording detected multiple frequencies from the ischemic portion of jejunum before revascularization, whereas normal serosal intestinal slow wave frequencies were observed after revascularization. The preoperative MENG data also showed signals with multiple frequencies suggestive of uncoupling and intestinal ischemia similar to intraoperative serosal EMG. Our results showed that multichannel MENG can identify intestinal slow wave dysrhythmias in CMI patients. ? 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Magnetoenterogram; Mesenteric ischemia; Slow wave,Article; brain radiography; clinical trial; electromyogram; human; intestinal slow wave dysrhythmia; intestine ischemia; jejunum; magnetic field; magnetoenterogram; magnetometer; mesenteric ischemia; non invasive procedure; noninvasive biomagnetic detection; postprandial state; priority journal; tachycardia; chronic disease; comparative study; eating; electrodiagnosis; electromyography; gastrointestinal motility; magnetometry; mesenteric ischemia; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; time factor; Chronic Disease; Eating; Electrodiagnosis; Electromyography; Gastrointestinal Motility; Humans; Jejunum; Magnetometry; Mesenteric Ischemia; Postprandial Period; Predictive Value of Tests; Time Factors,2-s2.0-84936868637

Bed sharing is a risk factor for sudden infant death syndrome but the mechanism of death is not clearly defined. Accidental suffocation may be one such mechanism. Objective: To describe accidental suffocation deaths during sleep in New Zealand between 2002 and 2009. Design: The New Zealand mortality database, which holds data collected by the Child Youth Mortality Review Committee and the Perinatal and Maternal Mortality Review Committee, was searched for potential deaths by accidental suffocation in infants less than 1 year of age. Deaths underwent a detailed analysis by demographic data and qualitative report. Results: There were 48 deaths due to accidental suffocation between 2002 and 2009 in New Zealand, equating to a rate of 0.10 deaths per 1000 live births. The most common age at death was 1 month or under (n=11, 23%). Deaths were due to overlay (n=30, 63%) or wedging (n=18, 37%) and two-thirds (n=34, 71%) were in a bed-sharing situation. A quarter of deaths (n=12, 25%) occurred in makeshift bedding arrangements, some of which were away from home. Conclusions: Accidental suffocation in bed was responsible for 48 preventable deaths. Prevention of these accidental deaths needs to focus on supporting changes in family behaviour with safety messages that are consistent, persistent and disseminated widely. ? 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

However, the exact nature of this relationship is not yet clear, with only a few studies examining this association using neuroimaging methods. In the present study, the neural substrates of creative thinking were assessed with a drawing task paradigm in healthy individuals using fMRI. These regions were then statistically correlated with the participants' level of schizotypy as measured by the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences (O-LIFE), which is a questionnaire consisting of four dimensions. Neural activations associated with the creativity task were observed in bilateral inferior temporal gyri, left insula, left parietal lobule, right angular gyrus, as well as regions in the prefrontal cortex. This widespread pattern of activation suggests that creative thinking utilises multiple neurocognitive networks, with creative production being the result of collaboration between these regions. Furthermore, the correlational analyses found the Unusual Experiences factor of the O-LIFE to be the most common dimension associated with these areas, followed by the Impulsive Nonconformity dimension. These correlations were negative, indicating that individuals who scored the highest in these factors displayed the least amount of activation when performing the creative task. This is in line with the idea that 'less is more' for creativity, where the deactivation of specific cortical areas may facilitate creativity. Thus, these findings contribute to the evidence of a common neural basis between creativity and schizotypy. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Creativity; Divergent thinking; FMRI; O-LIFE; Personality; Schizotypy,adult; angular gyrus; Article; clinical article; controlled study; creativity; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; inferior temporal gyrus; insula; left hemisphere; male; Oxford Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences; parietal lobe; prefrontal cortex; questionnaire; right hemisphere; schizotypal personality disorder; stimulus response; visual stimulation; young adult; adolescent; brain; brain mapping; multivariate analysis; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; photostimulation; physiology; psychology; regression analysis; schizotypal personality disorder; thinking; vision; Adolescent; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Creativity; Female; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Schizotypal Personality Disorder; Surveys and Questionnaires; Thinking; Visual Perception; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84929626143

Cough and apnea are common findings in pertussis and also in bronchiolitis, the most common cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants. The objective was to determine the prevalence of B. pertussis infection in children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and to describe its clinical course. Methods: Children hospitalized with bronchiolitis and age <2 years were eligible for a prospective, multicenter cohort study during 3 consecutive winter seasons (November-March) from 2007 to 2010. Sixteen sites in 12 states participated using a standardized enrollment protocol. Families were asked the 2010 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pertussis classification questions. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained and tested by real-time polymerase chain reaction for 16 viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and B. pertussis. Results: Two thousand sixty-eight (94%) of 2207 children had 1 or more respiratory pathogens. B. pertussis was identified in 4 children [0.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.1-0.5%] with 3 having a viral co-infection. All 4 were younger than 4 months; 2 met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of probable pertussis; and 3 had received at least 1 dose of an acellular pertussis vaccine. During the hospitalization, 2 had paroxysmal cough, 1 required intensive care unit care and the median length of stay was 13 days. Conclusions: Our data support that B. pertussis is an uncommon pathogen in U.S. children hospitalized with bronchiolitis in the winter. Making a diagnosis of pertussis can be challenging because the disease can be atypical and may not meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition of probable infection. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Algorithms exist to map 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) responses to EQ-5D item responses and preference weights, but none have been validated in populations where disability is prevalent, such as injury. Methods: Data were extracted from the Validating and Improving injury Burden Estimates Study (Injury-VIBES) for 10,166 adult, hospitalized trauma patients, with both the three-level EQ-5D (EQ-5D-3L) and SF-12 data responses at six and 12-months postinjury. Agreement between actual (patient-reported) and estimated (mapped from SF-12) EQ-5D-3L item responses and preference weights was assessed using Kappa, Prevalence-Adjusted Bias-Adjusted Kappa statistics and Bland-Altman plots. Results: Moderate agreement was observed for usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Agreement was substantial for mobility and self-care items. The mean differences in preference weights were -0.024 and -0.012 at six and 12months (p < 0.001), respectively. The Bland-Altman plot limits of agreement were large compared to the range of valid preference weight values (-0.56 to 1.00). Estimated EQ-5D-3L responses under-reported disability for all items except pain/discomfort. Conclusions: Caution should be taken when using EQ-5D-3L responses mapped from the SF-12 to describe patient outcomes or when undertaking economic evaluation, due to the underestimation of disability associated with mapped values. The findings from this study could be used to adjust expected EQ-5D-3L preference weights when estimated from SF-12 item responses when combining data from studies that use either instrument. 2015 ?

Methods: We studied 54 healthy young women aged 20-30 years. Participants were grouped according to age at menarche: Early (?11.0 years; n=13), Average (&gt;12.0 and ?13.0 years; n=28), and Late (?14.0 years, n=13). Primary outcome was insulin sensitivity measured using intravenous glucose tolerance tests and Bergman's minimal model. Body composition was assessed using whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Results: Earlier menarche was associated with lower insulin sensitivity (p=0.015). There was also a continuous increase in adiposity with younger age at menarche, which was associated with increased weight (p=0.001), BMI (p=0.002), total body fat (p=0.049), and truncal fat (p=0.020). Stratified analyses showed that insulin sensitivity in Early women (5.5×10-4·min-1(mU/l)) was lower than in Average (8.0×10-4·min-1(mU/l), p=0.021) and Late (8.6×10-4·min-1(mU/l), p=0.033) groups. Early women (weight=66.1 kg; BMI=24.1 kg/m2) were considerably heavier and fatter than Average (59.0 kg, p=0.004; 21.4 kg/m2, p=0.002) and Late (57.0 kg, p=0.001; 20.8 kg/m2, p=0.0009) women. Conclusions: Early menarche is associated with lower insulin sensitivity and increased adiposity in young adulthood, potentially increasing the risk of type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome later in life. ? 2015 Wilson et al.

Although there has been a ""turn"" to emotions and affect within academia over the last two decades, it has been somewhat remiss that pleasure, as an integral aspect of human life, has not received greater attention from sociologists of sport, exercise and physical education. This book addresses this issue via an unabashed examination of sport and the moving body via a ""pleasure lens."" It provides new insights about the production of various identities, power relations and social issues, and the dialectical links between the socio-cultural and the body. Taking a wide-sweeping view of pleasure - dignified and debauched, distinguished and mundane - it examines topics as diverse as aging, health, fandom, running, extreme sports, biopolitics, consumerism, feminism, sex and sexuality. In drawing from diverse theoretical approaches and original empirical research, the text reveals the social and political significance of pleasure and provides a more rounded, dynamic and sensual account of sport. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.

The aim of the present study was to investigate three common cognitive screening tools: the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), the Rowland Universal Dementia Assessment Scale (RUDAS), and the recently revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Assessment Version III (ACE-III). Methods: The ACE-III, MoCA and RUDAS were administered in random order to a sample of 37 participants with diagnosed mild dementia and 47 comparison participants without dementia. The diagnostic accuracy of the three tests was assessed. Results: All the tests showed good overall accuracy as assessed by area under the ROC Curve, 0.89 (95% CI = 0.80-0.95) for the ACE-III, 0.84 (0.75-0.91) for the MoCA, and 0.86 (0.77-0.93) for RUDAS. The three tests were strongly correlated: r(84) = 0.85 (0.78-0.90) between the ACE-III and MoCA, 0.70 (0.57-0.80) between the ACE-III and RUDAS; and 0.65 (0.50-0.76) between the MoCA and RUDAS. The data derived optimal cut-off points for were lower than the published recommendations for the ACE-III (optimal cut-point ?76, sensitivity = 81.1%, specificity = 85.1%) and the MoCA (?20, sensitivity = 78.4%, specificity = 83.0%), but similar for the RUDAS (?22, sensitivity = 78.4%, specificity = 85.1%). Conclusions: All three tools discriminated well overall between cases of mild dementia and controls. To inform interpretation of these tests in clinical settings, it would be useful for future research to address more inclusive and potentially age-stratified local norms. Copyright ?

Indigenous people often have a higher smoking prevalence during pregnancy than non-Indigenous populations. In New Zealand (NZ), the smoking rates among Indigenous M?ori women who are pregnant have reduced since 1991 (68?%) but still remains high in 2007 (34?%) (Morton et al. 2010). The success rate of most smoking cessation interventions for pregnant smokers is low at <6?% (Lumley et al. 2009). In other populations of pregnant women, financial incentives have been shown to increase the attractiveness of smoking cessation programs and increase the number of quit attempts. A feasibility study?was undertaken to determine the likely effectiveness of an incentives-based cessation trial among pregnant M?ori women that smoked. Pregnant smokers, aged 16?years and older, who self-identified as M?ori, were 2–30?weeks pregnant, and currently smoked, were recruited through health practitioners, print media, and radio adverts in Auckland, NZ. Participants were randomised to (1) usual cessation support, including information about different cessation products and services, and access to nicotine replacement therapy (control), (2) usual cessation support plus a retail voucher to the value of NZ$25?for each ‘abstinent from smoking’ week for 8 weeks (voucher), or (3) usual cessation support plus product to the value of NZ$25 for each ‘abstinent from smoking’ week for 8 weeks (product). Outcomes measures included weekly self-reported and monthly biochemically verified smoking status, and acceptability. Of the 74 referred women, 50 declined involvement in the study and 24 consented and were randomised (eight control, eight voucher and eight to product). The mean age of participants was 25?years old (±2.25). Overall 21?% (n?=?5) of the women were abstinent from smoking for at least 6 weeks of the eight, one from the control, six from the product and three from the voucher. Our findings suggest that incentives, in particular a choice of products, may be an effective addition to usual care to increase smoking cessation among pregnant M?ori women, which has the potential to improve health outcomes for both the mother and child. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Incentives; Indigenous; Pregnant; Smoking cessation,adult; controlled study; economics; epidemiology; feasibility study; female; human; motivation; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; pregnancy; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial; smoking; smoking cessation; Adult; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Motivation; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Pregnancy; Smoking; Smoking Cessation,2-s2.0-84957968456

We surveyed senior emergency physicians to see if their fluid resuscitation practices conformed to published clinical guidelines. Methods: This is a cross-sectional, Internet-based survey of senior emergency medical staff in any of 12 Paediatric Research in Emergency Departments International Collaborative (PREDICT) Network centres in Australia and New Zealand. Results: There were 110 of 120 (92%) senior medical staff who responded. Ninety-eight per cent of respondents used 0.9% saline as their primary resuscitation fluid. Sixty-two per cent of respondents used 20 mL/kg fluid bolus for every bolus, 30% used 20 mL/kg for the first bolus and 10 mL/kg subsequently. Response to fluid bolus administration was based on clinical parameters in 92% of respondents (heart rate, BP, skin perfusion/mottling and central capillary refill), conscious state in 80% and venous lactate in 75%. Harm from fluid bolus administration was routinely monitored for by 81% of respondents. In those assessing for harm, clinical parameters were reported to be most commonly used (respiratory rate and effort in 60%, SpO2 in 55%, presence of crackles on lung auscultation in 50% and hepatomegaly in 42%). Invasive or ultrasound-based monitoring was used infrequently. Conclusions: Paediatric sepsis is reported to be managed by senior emergency physicians largely according to published guidelines.

Method: An online survey was completed by 1781 New Zealand adults who had taken ADs in the previous 5 years. Results: All 18 psychosocial variables measured were associated with depression reduction, and 16 with improved quality of life (QoL). Logistic regression models revealed that the quality of the relationship with the prescriber was related to both depression reduction and improved QoL. In addition, depression reduction was related to younger age, higher income, being fully informed about ADs by the prescriber, fewer social causal beliefs for depression and not having lost a loved one in the 2 months prior to prescription. Furthermore, both outcome measures were positively related to belief in 'chemical' rather than 'placebo' effects. Conclusion: There are multiple non-pharmacological processes involved in recovery while taking ADs. Enhancing them, for example focusing on the prescriber-patient relationship and giving more information, may enhance recovery rates, with or without ADs. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Methods: Twenty people with multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke, randomised to an experimental and control group, set up to three mobility related goals with a physiotherapist. The experimental group also formulated if-then plans for every goal. Data collection: Focus groups and interviews with participants and therapists; Patient Activation Measure (PAM), 10-m walk test, Rivermead Mobility Index, self-efficacy, subjective health status, quality of life. Results: Qualitative data highlighted one main theme: Rehabilitation in context, encapsulating the usefulness of the if-then strategy in thinking about the patient in the context of complexity, the usefulness of home-based rehabilitation, and the perceived need for a few more sessions. Changes in walking speed were in the expected direction for both groups; PAM scores improved over 3 months in both groups. Conclusion: If-then plans were feasible and acceptable in bridging the goal intention-action gap in rehabilitation with people with MS and stroke, who are experiencing difficulties with mobility. This approach can now be adapted and trialled further in a definitive study.Implications for RehabilitationGoal planning in rehabilitation necessitates specific strategies that help people engage in goal-related tasks.If-then plans aim to support people to deal more effectively with self-regulatory problems that might undermine goal striving and have been found to be effective in health promotion and health behaviour change.This feasibility study with people with a stroke and multiple sclerosis has demonstrated that if-then plans are feasible and acceptable to patients and physiotherapists in supporting goal-directed behaviour. ? 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

The advent of affordable point-of-care testing presents an opportunity for community pharmacists to provide anticoagulation management services, better utilizing their training, reducing the workload on medical practices and improving accessibility and convenience for patients. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of anticoagulation management by community pharmacists. Methods All patients enrolled in a pilot programme for a community pharmacy anticoagulation management service using point-of-care international normalized ratio testing and computer-assisted dose adjustment were included in a follow-up study, including before-after comparison. Outcomes included time in therapeutic range (TTR), time above and below range, number and proportion of results outside efficacy and safety thresholds, and a comparison of care led by pharmacists and care led by a primary-care general practitioner (GP). Key findings A total of 693 patients were enrolled, predominantly males over 65 years of age with atrial fibrillation. The mean TTR was 78.6% (95% CI 49.3% to 100%). A subgroup analysis (n = 221) showed an increase in mean TTR from 61.8% under GP-led care to 78.5% under pharmacist-led care (P < 0.001), reflecting a reduction in the time above and, in particular, below the range. The mean TTR by pharmacy ranged from 71.4% to 84.1%. The median number of tests per month was not statistically different between GP- and pharmacist-led care. Conclusions Community-pharmacist-led anticoagulation care utilizing point-of-care testing and computerized decision support is safe and effective, resulting in significant improvements in TTR.

Malawi introduced pneumococcal conjugate and rotavirus vaccines to the immunisation programme in 2011 and 2012, respectively. Evaluating their effectiveness is vital to ensure optimal implementation and justify sustained investment. Methods/Design: A national evaluation platform was established to determine vaccine effectiveness and impact in Malawi. Impact and effectiveness against vaccine-type invasive pneumococcal disease, radiological pneumonia and rotavirus gastroenteritis are investigated using before-after incidence comparisons and case-control designs, respectively. Mortality is assessed using a prospective population cohort. Cost-effectiveness evaluation is nested within the case-control studies. We describe platform characteristics including strengths and weaknesses for conducting vaccine evaluations. Discussion: Integrating data from individual level and ecological methods across multiple sites provides comprehensive information for policymakers on programme impact and vaccine effectiveness including changes in serotype/genotype distribution over time. Challenges to robust vaccine evaluation in real-world conditions include: vaccination ascertainment; pre-existing rapid decline in mortality and pneumococcal disease in the context of non-vaccine interventions; and the maintenance of completeness and quality of reporting at scale and over time. In observational non-randomised designs ascertainment of vaccine status may be biased particularly in infants with fatal outcomes. In the context of multiple population level interventions targeting study endpoints attribution of reduced incidence to vaccine impact may be flawed. Providing evidence from several independent but complementary studies will provide the greatest confidence in assigning impact. Welcome declines in disease incidence and in child mortality make accrual of required sample sizes difficult, necessitating large studies to detect the relatively small but potentially significant contribution of vaccines to mortality prevention. Careful evaluation of vaccine effectiveness and impact in such settings is critical to sustaining support for vaccine programmes. Our evaluation platform covers a large population with a high prevalence of HIV and malnutrition and its findings will be relevant to other settings in sub-Saharan Africa. ? 2015 The Authors.",Effectiveness; Impact; Malawi; Pneumococcal; Rotavirus; Vaccine,"Pneumococcus vaccine; Rotavirus vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; Rotavirus vaccine; Article; capacity building; case control study; cost effectiveness analysis; drug efficacy; human; Malawi; morbidity; mortality; pneumococcal infection; priority journal; program effectiveness; program impact; protocol compliance; Rotavirus infection; sentinel surveillance; vaccination; viral gastroenteritis; adolescent; adult; child; cohort analysis; female; health care policy; immunology; incidence; infant; male; newborn; Pneumonia, Pneumococcal; preschool child; preventive health service; Rotavirus Infections; survival analysis; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Immunization Programs; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Malawi; Male; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Pneumonia, Pneumococcal; Rotavirus Infections; Rotavirus Vaccines; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84929047673

The aim of this study was to explore 10-year changes in the sodium content of New Zealand processed foods. Nutrient data for nine key food groups were collected in supermarkets in 2003 (n = 323) and 2013 (n = 885). Mean (SD) and median (min, max) sodium content were calculated by food group, year and label type (private/branded). Paired t-tests explored changes in sodium content for all products available for sale in both years (matched; n = 182). The mean (SD) sodium content of all foods was 436 (263) mg (100 g)-1 in 2003 and 433 (304) mg (100 g)-1 in 2013, with no significant difference in matched products over time (mean (SD) difference, -56 (122) mg (100 g)-1, 12%; p = 0.22). The largest percentage reductions in sodium (for matched products) were observed for Breakfast Cereals (28%; -123 (125) mg (100 g)-1), Canned Spaghetti (15%; -76 (111) mg (100 g)-1) and Bread (14%; -68 (69) mg (100 g)-1). The reduction in sodium was greater for matched private vs. branded foods (-69 vs. -50 mg (100 g)-1, both p &lt; 0.001). There has been modest progress with sodium reduction in some New Zealand food categories over the past 10 years.

Dosing schemes for neonates are often based on adult regimens, or are simply empiric, in part due to the lack of neonatal pharmacokinetic information. The authors sought to determine the pharmacokinetics of EACA in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery and to devise a dosing regimen for this population. Methods: Ten neonates undergoing cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass were given EACA according to standard practice, and blood was drawn at 10 time points to determine drug concentrations. Time-concentration profiles were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects models. Parameter estimates (standardized to a 70-kg person) were used to develop a dosing regimen intended to maintain a target concentration shown to inhibit fibrinolysis in neonatal plasma (50 mg/l). Results: Pharmacokinetics were described using a two-compartment model plus an additional compartment for the cardiopulmonary bypass pump. First-order elimination was described with a clearance of 5.07 l/h × (WT/70)0.75. Simulation showed a dosing regimen with a loading dose of 40 mg/kg and an infusion of 30 mg·kg-1·h-1, with a pump prime concentration of 100 mg/l maintained plasma concentrations above 50 mg/l in 90% of neonates during cardiopulmonary bypass surgery. Conclusions: EACA clearance, expressed using allometry, is reduced in neonates compared with older children and adults. Loading dose and infusion dose are approximately half those required in children and adults. ? 2015, the American Society of Anesthesiologists, Inc. Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

There are three common variants of the DBP, Gc1s (1s), Gc1f (1f), Gc2 (2) that result in six common phenotypes (1s/1s, 1s/1f, 1s/2, 1f/1f, 1f/2, and 2/2). These phenotypes can be identified by genotyping for the two single nucleotide polymorphisms rs7041 and rs4588 in the GC gene. The DBP variants have different binding coefficients for the vitamin D metabolites, and accordingly there may be important relations between DBP phenotypes and health. Methods: DNA was prepared from subjects who participated in the fourth survey of the Troms? Study in 1994-1995 and who were registered with the endpoints myocardial infarction (MI), type 2 diabetes (T2DM), cancer or death as well as a randomly selected control group. The endpoint registers were complete up to 2010-2013. Genotyping was performed for rs7041 and rs4588 and serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) was measured. Results: Genotyping for rs7041 and rs4588 was performed successfully in 11 704 subjects. Among these, 1660 were registered with incident MI, 958 with T2DM, 2410 with cancer and 4318 had died. Subjects with the DBP phenotype 1f/1f had 23-26% reduced risk of incident cancer compared to the 1s/1s and 2/2 phenotypes (P < 0.02, Cox regression with gender as covariate). Differences in serum 25(OH)D levels could not explain the apparent cancer protective effect of the DBP variant 1f. In addition to cancer and 25(OH)D, there were significant associations between DBP phenotype and body height, hip circumference and serum calcium. Conclusion: There are important biological differences between the common DBP phenotypes. If the relation between the DBP variant 1f and cancer is confirmed in other studies, determination of DBP phenotype may have clinical importance. ? 2015 Jorde et al.

Low liver copper has been linked to hepatic lipid build-up (steatosis) in animals with systemic copper deficiency caused by low-copper diets. However, hepatic copper status in patients with NAFLD or NASH is uncertain, and a validated animal model useful for the study of hepatic copper regulation in common forms of metabolic liver disease is lacking. Here, we report parallel measurements of essential metal levels in whole-liver tissue and defatted-dried liver tissue from ob/ob and non-obese control mice. Measurements in whole-liver tissue from ob/ob mice at an age when they have developed NAFLD/NASH, provide compelling evidence for factitious lowering of copper and all other essential metals by steatosis, and so cannot be used to study hepatic metal regulation in this model. By marked contrast, metal measurements in defatted-dried liver samples reveal that most essential metals were actually normal and indicate specific lowering of copper in ob/ob mice, consistent with hepatic copper deficiency. Thus ob/ob mice can provide a model useful for the study of copper regulation in NAFLD and NASH, provided levels are measured in defatted-dried liver tissue. ? 2015 The Authors.

Promotional flyers could be an effective tool for encouraging healthier food choices; however, there is a lack of good-quality evidence on this topic. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the proportions of healthy and unhealthy foods on promotion in Dutch supermarket flyers. Methods: Supermarket food promotions were assessed using the weekly promotional flyers of four major Dutch supermarkets over a period of eight weeks. All promotions were evaluated for healthiness, price discount, minimum purchase amount, product category and promotion type. The level of healthiness consists of a 'healthy' group; products which have a positive effect on preventing chronic diseases and can be eaten every day. The 'unhealthy' group contain products which have adverse effects on the prevention of chronic diseases. Data were analysed using ANOVA, independent t-tests and chi-square tests. Results: A total of 1,495 promotions were included in this study. There were more promotions in the unhealthy category; 70% of promotions were categorised as unhealthy. The price discount was greater for the healthy promotions (mean 29.5%, SD 12.1) than for the two categories of unhealthy promotions (23.7%, SD 10.8; 25.4%, SD 10.5, respectively), a tendency which was mainly due to discounts in the fruit and vegetables category. To obtain the advertised discount, a significantly higher number of products had to be purchased in the unhealthy category than in the healthier categories. Promotions in the category meat, poultry and fish category occurred frequently. Compared to traditional supermarkets, discounter supermarkets had higher percentages of unhealthy food discounts, lower discount levels and lower minimum purchase amounts. Conclusion: This research confirmed that unhealthy foods are more frequently advertised than healthier foods in Dutch supermarket flyers. Moreover, consumers had to buy more products to achieve the discount when the promotion was categorized as unhealthy, providing extra incentive for buying additional unhealthy products. Future research should explore the proportion of healthy and unhealthy food discounts in relation to supermarkets' total product range, to determine if unhealthy products are over-represented in promotions or if there are more unhealthy products stocked in supermarkets overall. The findings of this study provide an important basis for future intervention and policy development aiming to achieve healthier supermarket environments. ? 2015 Ravensbergen et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Food; Healthy eating; Promotions; Store flyers; Supermarkets,"advertising; analysis of variance; commercial phenomena; cross-sectional study; economics; food; food preference; fruit; health promotion; human; Netherlands; organic food; procedures; statistics and numerical data; vegetable; Advertising as Topic; Analysis of Variance; Commerce; Cross-Sectional Studies; Food; Food Preferences; Food, Organic; Fruit; Health Promotion; Humans; Netherlands; Vegetables",2-s2.0-84929611504

Interactions occurring at the level of individual cells may lead to the development of spatial structure which will affect the dynamics of migrating cells at a population level. Models that try to predict population-level behaviour often take a mean-field approach, which assumes that individuals interact with one another in proportion to their average density and ignores the presence of any small-scale spatial structure. In this work, we develop a lattice-free individual-based model (IBM) that uses random walk theory to model the stochastic interactions occurring at the scale of individual migrating cells. We incorporate a mechanism for local directional bias such that an individual's direction of movement is dependent on the degree of cell crowding in its neighbourhood. As an alternative to the mean-field approach, we also employ spatial moment theory to develop a population-level model which accounts for spatial structure and predicts how these individual-level interactions propagate to the scale of the whole population. The IBM is used to derive an equation for dynamics of the second spatial moment (the average density of pairs of cells) which incorporates the neighbour-dependent directional bias, and we solve this numerically for a spatially homogeneous case. ? 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

These streets are also the neighbourhood environment of children who live in the central city. In the past, the wellbeing and sensibilities of children have been marginalised in planning practices in western cities but this is beginning to change with child-friendly and inclusive city discourses now more common. In this paper we report on children's experiences confronting diversity in inner-city Auckland. In 2012, 40 inner-city children, 9-12 years, participated in walking interviews in their local streets and school-based focus group discussions. As the children talked about their lives, moving and playing around neighbourhood streets, many described distress and discomfort as they confronted homelessness, drunkenness, and signs of the sex industry. A few older children also described strategies for coping with these encounters, an emerging acceptance of difference and pride in becoming streetwise. New Zealand (NZ) has a history of progressive social policy. In 2003, it became the first country in the world to decriminalise all forms of prostitution. Securing the health and human rights of sex workers were the primary drivers of the reforms. Similar concerns for health and rights underpin broadly inclusive local policies towards homelessness. To promote the health and wellbeing of inner city children their presence on city streets, alongside those of other marginalised groups, needs to be at the forefront of planning concerns. However we conclude that there are inherent tensions in promoting a child-friendly city in which diversity and inclusiveness are also valued. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Children; Homelessness; Independent mobility; Inner city; Neighbourhood; New Zealand (NZ); Sex industry; Wellbeing,"child; child psychology; city; cultural anthropology; demography; female; health service; homelessness; human; human relation; male; New Zealand; poverty; recreation; school; social distance; walking; Child; Cities; Cultural Diversity; Female; Health Services; Homeless Persons; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; New Zealand; Play and Playthings; Poverty Areas; Psychology, Child; Residence Characteristics; Schools; Social Distance; Walking",2-s2.0-84939997827

This definition is widely used within social and health sciences to identify, measure, and explain forms of inequality in human societies based on material and social conditions. From a multi-disciplinary social science perspective, we conducted a systematic literature review of published material in English through online database searches and books since 1966. We review the concept and measurement of relative 'deprivation' focussing on area-based deprivation in relation to inequities in health and social outcomes. This paper presents a perspective based in Aotearoa/New Zealand where colonisation has shaped the contours of racialised health inequities and current applications and understandings of 'deprivation'.We provide a critique of Townsend's concept of deprivation and area-based deprivation through a critical, structural analysis and suggest alternatives to give social justice a better chance. Deprivation measures used without critical reflection can lead to deficit framing of populations and maintain current inequities in health and social outcomes. We contend therefore that the lack of consideration of (bio)power, privilege, epistemology and (bio)politics is a central concern in studies of deprivation. Our review highlights the need for the academy to balance the asymmetry between qualitative and quantitative studies of deprivation through trans-disciplinary approaches to understanding deprivation, and subsequently, social and health inequities. We recommend that deprivation research needs be critically applied through a decolonising lens to avoid deficit framing and suggest that there is space for a tool that focuses on measuring the unequal distribution of power and privilege in populations. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Aotearoa/New Zealand; Deprivation; Disadvantage; Health inequities; Poverty; Power/knowledge; Privilege; Social justice,behavior; health care disparity; human; New Zealand; politics; poverty; psychology; social isolation; social justice; vulnerable population; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; New Zealand; Politics; Poverty; Power (Psychology); Psychosocial Deprivation; Social Justice; Vulnerable Populations,2-s2.0-84939556079

The aim of this present study was to investigate whether two probiotics, Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 (HN001) and Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019 (HN019), can modify the known genetic predisposition to eczema conferred by genetic variation in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) genes in a high-risk infant population. Methods: We selected 54 SNPs in the Toll-like receptor genes. These SNPs were analysed in 331 children of sole European ancestry as part of a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial examining the effects of HN001 and HN019 supplementation on eczema development and atopic sensitization. Results: The data showed that 26 TLR SNPs interacted with HN001 resulting in a significantly reduced risk of eczema, 18 for eczema severity as defined by SCORAD ?10 and 20 for atopic sensitization compared to placebo. There were only two SNPs that interacted with HN019 resulting in a reduced risk of eczema, eczema severity or atopy. Conclusions: This is the first study to show that the negative impact of specific TLR genotypes may be positively affected by probiotic supplementation. HN001 exhibits a much stronger effect than HN019 in this respect. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Atopy; Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019; Eczema; Infants; Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001; Probiotics; SNPs; Toll-like receptors,"probiotic agent; toll like receptor; toll like receptor 1; toll like receptor 10; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 4; toll like receptor 5; toll like receptor 7; toll like receptor 8; toll like receptor 9; probiotic agent; toll like receptor; Article; asthma; atopy; Bifidobacterium animalis; Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019; contact sensitization; controlled study; eczema; family history; genetic predisposition; genotype; high risk infant; human; immunological tolerance; infant; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001; nonhuman; pollen allergy; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; risk reduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; skin sensitization; Bifidobacterium; Caucasian; Dermatitis, Atopic; diet supplementation; diet therapy; double blind procedure; eczema; female; follow up; genetics; immunology; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; newborn; placebo effect; pregnancy; preschool child; risk; single nucleotide polymorphism; Bifidobacterium; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dietary Supplements; Double-Blind Method; Eczema; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Placebo Effect; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Pregnancy; Probiotics; Risk; Toll-Like Receptors",2-s2.0-84928173892

However, less is known about the health impact of residential mobility, particularly at intra-urban scales.We used an encrypted National Health Index (eNHI) number to link individual-level data recorded in routine national health databases to construct a cohort of 641,532 participants aged 30+ years to investigate the association between moving and CVD hospitalisations in Auckland, New Zealand. Residential mobility was measured for participants according to changes in the census Meshblock of usual residence, obtained from the Primary Health Organisation (PHO) database for every calendar quarter between 1/1/2006 and 31/12/2012. The NZDep2006 area deprivation score at the start and end of a participant's inclusion in the study was used to measure deprivation mobility.We investigated the relative risk of movers being hospitalised for CVD relative to stayers using multi-variable binomial regression models, controlling for age, gender, deprivation and ethnicity. Considered together, movers were 1.22 (1.19-1.26) times more likely than stayers to be hospitalised for CVD. Using the 5. ×. 5 deprivation origin-destination matrix to model a patient's risk of CVD based on upward, downward or sideways deprivation mobility, movers within the least deprived (NZDep2006 Quintile 1) areas were 10% less likely than stayers to be hospitalised for CVD, while movers within the most deprived (NZDep2006 Q5) areas were 45% more likely than stayers to have had their first CVD hospitalisation in 2006-2012(RR: 1.45 [1.35-1.55]). Participants who moved upward also had higher relative risks of having a CVD event, although their risk was less than those observed for participants experiencing downward deprivation mobility.This research suggests that residential mobility is an important determinant of CVD in Auckland. Further investigation is required to determine the impact moving has on the risk of CVD by ethnicity. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",CVD; Deprivation; Hospitalisations; Inequalities; Migration; Mobility; New Zealand; Record linkage,"cardiovascular disease; ethnicity; health impact; health risk; migration; residential mobility; adult; aged; Article; biogeography; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; electronic medical record; female; health disparity; high risk patient; hospitalization; human; major clinical study; male; medical geography; migration; New Zealand; residential home; risk assessment; Cardiovascular Diseases; ethnology; hospitalization; middle aged; population dynamics; population research; risk factor; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Auckland; New Zealand; North Island; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Censuses; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Population Dynamics; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors",2-s2.0-84928152787

Bilateral mastectomy rates are increasing, although the benefits of this surgery are only established in a small percentage of women. In this study we investigated the relationship between causal beliefs and the decision to have a bilateral mastectomy. Method: Women (N = 2,269) from the Army of Women's breast cancer research registry completed an online survey. Women were asked what they believed caused their cancer and responses were coded into 8 causal categories. Participants were also asked about the type of surgery they underwent following their breast cancer diagnosis. The odds ratios for having a double mastectomy were calculated for each causal category using random/bad luck as a referent category. Results: Hormonal factors (22%) and genetics (19%) were the most common causal belief, followed by don't know (19%), environmental toxins (11%), negative emotions (9%), poor health behavior (8%), other (6%) and random/bad luck (6%). Compared with the referent category, the odds ratio of having a bilateral mastectomy was significantly higher in both the genetics and hormonal causal belief groups (OR = 2.36, 95% CI [1.38, 4.02] and OR = 1.98, 95% CI [1.16, 3.38], respectively). Conclusions: Beliefs in a genetic cause for breast cancer are common and are associated with high rates of bilateral mastectomy.

However, these studies have been criticized for failing to control for relative frequency of AmED versus alcohol-only consumption sessions. These studies also do not account for quantity of consumption and general alcohol-related risk-taking propensity. The aims of the present study were to (i) compare rates of risk-taking in AmED versus alcohol sessions among consumers with matched frequency of use and (ii) identify consumption and person characteristics associated with risk-taking behavior in AmED sessions. Methods: Data were extracted from 2 Australian community samples and 1 New Zealand community sample of AmED consumers (n?=?1,291). One-fifth (21%; n?=?273) reported matched frequency of AmED and alcohol use. Results: The majority (55%) of matched-frequency participants consumed AmED and alcohol monthly or less. The matched-frequency sample reported significantly lower odds of engaging in 18 of 25 assessed risk behaviors in AmED versus alcohol sessions. Similar rates of engagement were evident across session type for the remaining behaviors, the majority of which were low prevalence (reported by <15%). Regression modeling indicated that risk-taking in AmED sessions was primarily associated with risk-taking in alcohol sessions, with increased average energy drink (ED) intake associated with certain risk behaviors (e.g., being physically hurt, not using contraception, and driving while over the legal alcohol limit). Conclusions: Bivariate analyses from a matched-frequency sample align with past research showing lower odds of risk-taking behavior after AmED versus alcohol consumption for the same individuals. Multivariate analyses showed that risk-taking in alcohol sessions had the strongest association with risk-taking in AmED sessions. However, hypotheses of increased risk-taking post-AmED consumption were partly supported: Greater ED intake was associated with increased likelihood of specific behaviors, including drink-driving, sexual behavior, and aggressive behaviors in the matched-frequency sample after controlling for alcohol intake and risk-taking in alcohol sessions. These findings highlight the need to consider both personal characteristics and beverage effects in harm reduction strategies for AmED consumers. ? 2015 by the Research Society on Alcoholism.",Alcohol; Caffeine; Energy drink; Harm; Risk,alcohol; illicit drug; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; Australian; consumer; controlled study; drinking behavior; energy drink; energy drink consumption; female; fluid intake; high risk behavior; human; New Zealand; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; sexual practice; smoking; tobacco; adolescent; adverse effects; drug interaction; energy drink; high risk behavior; male; self report; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Alcohol Drinking; Drug Interactions; Energy Drinks; Female; Humans; Male; Risk-Taking; Self Report; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84927690323

The current surface landmark remains a popular approach due to its desirable success rate. However, incomplete ossification of the posterior vertebral elements can make this procedure for neonatal caudal anesthesia difficult. The aim of this study was to describe the anatomical relationship of the posterior superior iliac spines (PSISs) to the sacral cornua in infants using ultrasound. Methods A total of 26 healthy infants (17 female; mean age 13 weeks) were scanned by an experienced radiologist in the prone position with hip and knee joints flexed. The PSISs and sacral cornua were identified clinically then using ultrasound to assess whether these markings corresponded with the clinical markings. The distance between the PSISs and the distance between the tip of the PSIS and tip of the sacral cornu were measured using ultrasound. Results The PSISs were clinically identified in all babies, but the sacral cornua were not palpable in four babies (15%). The PSISs and sacral cornua were easily visualized using ultrasound in all participants. The mean distance between the two left and right PSISs was 3.4 ± 0.5 cm; the mean distance between the PSISs and cornu was 2.5 ± 0.5 cm on the left and right. Conclusion This study showed that the current landmark (equilateral triangle) for infant caudal anesthesia is unreliable. Importantly, the sacral hiatus is clinically identifiable only if the sacral cornua are palpable; otherwise, using ultrasound is essential. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",anesthesia; caudal block; caudal canal; infant; sacral cornua; sacral hiatus,"anatomic landmark; Article; caudal anesthesia; female; human; infant; male; normal human; pediatric anesthesia; posterior superior iliac spine; priority journal; sacral cornua; sacrum; spine; ultrasound; ultrasound scanner; caudal anesthesia; echography; endoscopic echography; newborn; procedures; Anesthesia, Caudal; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Sacrum; Ultrasonography, Interventional",2-s2.0-84926529486

Methods: A healthy sample of volunteers (N. =. 48) attended two laboratory sessions. In each, a local short term inflammatory skin reaction was induced with histamine. Participants were told that one session was a control session and the other was a treatment session in which an antihistamine cream would be applied to the arm to reduce the size of the weal and the experience of itch. Inert aqueous cream was applied in both sessions. Participants were randomly allocated to undergo either the control or the treatment session first. Results: The placebo manipulation successfully reduced self-reported itch from the control to the placebo treatment session, but no placebo effect was demonstrated in weal size. Order effects were observed such that only those who underwent control procedures first had a smaller weal in the placebo treatment session as compared to the control session. The same order effect was seen for reported itch at one minute post histamine administration, but this disappeared at the three and five minute measures. Conclusion: Findings suggest that explicit verbal suggestion can reduce the experience of itch. In addition to conscious awareness, a concrete representation of the suggested changes gained from prior experience to the stimulus may be an important component of placebo effects on inflammatory skin reactions. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Inflammatory skin reactions; Placebo effect; Placebo response; Suggestion,antihistaminic agent; histamine; placebo; skin cream; histamine; adult; Article; awareness; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; inflammatory skin reaction; male; normal human; placebo effect; pruritus; randomized controlled trial; self report; skin manifestation; suggestion; urticaria; chemically induced; persuasive communication; placebo effect; pruritus; psychology; urticaria; Adult; Female; Histamine; Humans; Male; Persuasive Communication; Placebo Effect; Pruritus; Urticaria,2-s2.0-84925861482

HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the first exon of the HTT gene, resulting in an expanded polyglutamine tract at the N-terminus of the huntingtin protein. Typical disease onset is around mid-life (adult-onset HD) whereas onset below 21 years is classified as juvenile HD. While much research has been done on the underlying HD disease mechanisms, little is known about regulation and expression levels of huntingtin RNA and protein. Results: In this study we used 15 human post-mortem HD brain samples to investigate the expression of wild-type and mutant huntingtin mRNA and protein. In adult-onset HD brain samples, there was a small but significantly lower expression of mutant huntingtin mRNA compared to wild-type huntingtin mRNA, while wild-type and mutant huntingtin protein expression levels did not differ significantly. Juvenile HD subjects did show a lower expression of mutant huntingtin protein compared to wild-type huntingtin protein. Our results in HD brain and fibroblasts suggest that protein aggregation does not affect levels of huntingtin RNA and protein. Additionally, we did not find any evidence for a reduced expression of huntingtin antisense in fibroblasts derived from a homozygous HD patient. Conclusions: We found small differences in allelic huntingtin mRNA levels in adult-onset HD brain, with significantly lower mutant huntingtin mRNA levels. Wild-type and mutant huntingtin protein were not significantly different in adult-onset HD brain samples. Conversely, in juvenile HD brain samples mutant huntingtin protein levels were lower compared with wild-type huntingtin, showing subtle differences between juvenile HD and adult-onset HD. Since most HD model systems harbor juvenile repeat expansions, our results suggest caution with the interpretation of huntingtin mRNA and protein studies using HD cell and animal models with such long repeats. Furthermore, our huntingtin antisense results in homozygous HD cells do not support reduced huntingtin antisense expression due to an expanded CAG repeat. ? 2015 Evers et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",HD patient-derived fibroblasts; Huntingtin; Huntingtin antisense transcript; Huntington disease; Juvenile HD; Post-mortem HD brain tissue,"huntingtin; messenger RNA; HTT protein, human; messenger RNA; mutant protein; nerve protein; adult; aged; Article; brain homogenate; brain tissue; CAG repeat; child; controlled study; exon; female; fibroblast; frontal cortex; human; human tissue; Huntington chorea; male; middle aged; middle temporal gyrus; onset age; preschool child; protein aggregation; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; school child; single nucleotide polymorphism; very elderly; Western blotting; young adult; autopsy; brain; genetics; Huntington chorea; metabolism; pathology; Animalia; Autopsy; Brain; Fibroblasts; Humans; Huntington Disease; Mutant Proteins; Nerve Tissue Proteins; RNA, Messenger",2-s2.0-84928546289

This investigation seeks to better understand the physiological objective of the nasal cycle in terms of airway health through the use of a computational nasal air-conditioning model. Method: A new state-variable heat and water mass transfer model is developed to predict airway surface liquid (ASL) hydration status within each nasal airway. Nasal geometry, based on in-vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data is used to apportion inter-nasal air flow. Results: The results demonstrate that the airway conducting the majority of the airflow also experiences a degree of ASL dehydration, as a consequence of undertaking the bulk of the heat and water mass transfer duties. In contrast, the reduced air conditioning demand within the other airway allows its ASL layer to remain sufficiently hydrated so as to support continuous mucociliary clearance.

Objective The aim of the study was to calculate the prevalence of anaemia in early pregnancy in a cohort of 'low risk' women participating in a large international multicentre prospective study (n = 5 609), to identify the modifiable risk factors for anaemia in pregnancy in this cohort, and to compare the birth outcomes between pregnancies with and without anaemia in early gestation. Methods The study is an analysis of data that were collected prospectively during the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints study. Anaemia was defined according to the World Health Organization's definition of anaemia in pregnancy (haemoglobin < 11g/dL). Binary logistic regression with adjustment for potential confounders (country, maternal age, having a marital partner, ethnic origin, years of schooling, and having paid work) was the main method of analysis. Results The hallmark findings were the low prevalence of anaemia (2.2%), that having no marital partner was an independent risk factor for having anaemia (OR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01-1.78), and that there was no statistically significant effect of anaemia on adverse pregnancy outcomes (small for gestational age, pre-tem birth, mode of delivery, low birth weight, APGAR score < 7 at one and five minutes). Adverse pregnancy outcomes were however more common in those with anaemia than in those without. Conclusion In this low risk healthy pregnant population we found a low anaemia rate. The absence of a marital partner was a non-modifiable factor, albeit one which may reflect a variety of confounding factors, that should be considered for addition to anaemia's conceptual framework of determinants. Although not statistically significant, clinically, a trend towards a higher risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes was observed in women that were anaemic in early pregnancy. ? 2015 Masukume et al.",,"folic acid; hemoglobin; adult; anemia; Apgar score; Article; cohabiting person; comparative study; controlled study; delivery; developed country; disease association; educational status; employment status; ethnicity; female; first trimester pregnancy; hemoglobin blood level; human; iron intake; low birth weight; low risk population; major clinical study; nullipara; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; prevalence; prospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; small for date infant; vitamin intake; anemia; clinical trial; cohort analysis; gestational age; multicenter study; newborn; parity; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prematurity; procedures; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adult; Anemia; Cohort Studies; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Parity; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications, Hematologic; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84929486141

Resveratrol has been proposed as an effective treatment that helps lower the risk of developing complications of diabetes. To study the significance of glycosylation-related stress on the pathology of diabetes, the effects of resveratrol were examined in a mouse model of diabetes induced by MG. Resveratrol was given via oral gavage in MG-treated mice, and diabetes-related tests and markers were assessed using biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. Treatment with resveratrol markedly improved blood glucose level from the oral glucose tolerance test and promoted nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) phosphorylation (p < 0.05) in the pancreas of MG-treated mice. However, these effects were abolished by retinoic acid, Nrf2 inhibitor, in resveratrol and retinoic acid-treated and MG-induced mice.

Analyses using a linear model and a generalised linear mixed model showed statistically significant relationships between perceived naturalness of landscapes and their aesthetic ratings, and among ratings of perceived naturalness and ecological integrity and morphological condition. Expert measures of health and the aesthetic evaluations of the public were well aligned, indicating public preferences for landscapes of high ecological integrity with good morphological condition. Further analysis revealed participants used 'cues to care' to rate naturalness. This suggests that environmental education endeavours could further align values with these cues in efforts to enhance approaches to landscape sustainability. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Cues to care; Cultural sustainability; Ecological integrity; Landscape aesthetics; New Zealand; River rehabilitation; River Styles; Twin Streams,assessment method; environmental education; environmental management; habitat restoration; morphology; river; sustainability; Article; ecology; ecosystem health; environmental management; human; landscape; morphology; New Zealand; perception; quantitative analysis; river ecosystem; environmental protection; esthetics; public opinion; river; Auckland; New Zealand; North Island; Conservation of Natural Resources; Esthetics; New Zealand; Public Opinion; Rivers,2-s2.0-84922228090

Signalling pathways appear to converge on glycogen regulatory enzymes via insulin (glycogen synthase kinase 3β, protein phosphatase 1, allosteric action of glucose-6-phosphate), β-adrenergic (phosphorylase kinase protein phosphatase 1 inhibitor), and 5′ adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (allosteric action of glucose-6-phosphate, direct glycogen binding, insulin receptor). While cytosolic glycogen synthesis and breakdown are relatively well understood, recent findings relating to phagic glycogen degradation highlight a new area of investigation in the heart. It has been recently demonstrated that a specific glycophagy pathway is operational in the myocardium. Proteins involved in recruiting glycogen to the forming phagosome have been identified. Starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 is involved in binding glycogen and mediating membrane anchorage via interaction with a homologue of the phagosomal protein light-chain 3. Specifically, it has been shown that starch-binding domain-containing protein 1 and light-chain 3 have discrete phagosomal immunolocalization patterns in cardiomyocytes, indicating that autophagic trafficking of glycogen and protein cargo in cardiomyocytes can occur via distinct pathways. There is strong evidence from glycogen storage diseases that phagic/lysosomal glycogen breakdown is important for maintaining normal cardiac glycogen levels and does not simply constitute a redundant 'alternative' breakdown route for glycogen. Advancing understanding of glycogen handling in the heart is an important priority with relevance not only to genetic glycogen storage diseases but also to cardiac metabolic stress disorders such as diabetes and ischaemia. ? 2015 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Autophagy; Cardiac; Glucose; Glycogen storage diseases; Glycophagy; Heart; Metabolic stress,"alpha glucosidase; glucan 1,4 alpha glucosidase; glycogen; glycogen debranching enzyme; glycogen phosphorylase; insulin; lysosome associated membrane protein 2; glycogen; Article; autophagosome; autophagy; cellular distribution; enzyme active site; enzyme synthesis; glycogen analysis; glycogen metabolism; glycogen storage disease; glycogen synthesis; heart muscle; human; immunolocalization; metabolic stress; muscle contraction; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; animal; energy metabolism; glycogen storage disease; heart disease; heart muscle; kinetics; lysosome; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; phagosome; signal transduction; Animals; Energy Metabolism; Glycogen; Glycogen Storage Disease; Heart Diseases; Humans; Kinetics; Lysosomes; Myocardium; Phagosomes; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-84925457539

These findings are confounded by better prognostic characteristics among people practising extended hours. The aim of this article is to provide an overview of the methods and baseline characteristics for ACTIVE Dialysis Study participants. Methods This multicentre, randomized, open-label, blinded endpoint-assessment trial randomized participants receiving maintenance haemodialysis therapy to either extended (?24h) or standard (12-18h) weekly haemodialysis for 12 months. A web-based randomization system used minimization to ensure balanced allocation across regions, dialysis setting and dialysis vintage. The primary outcome is the change in quality of life over 12 months of study treatment assessed by EQ-5D. Secondary outcomes include change in left ventricular mass index assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and safety outcomes including dialysis access events. Results A total of 200 participants were recruited between 2009 and 2013 from Australia (29.0%), China (62.0%), Canada (5.5%) and New Zealand (3.5%). Participants had a mean age of 52 (±12) years and 11.5% were dialysing at home, with a mean duration of 13.9h per week over a median of three sessions. At baseline, 32.5% had a history of cardiovascular disease and 36.5% had diabetes. Conclusion The ACTIVE Dialysis Study has met its planned recruitment target. The participant population are drawn from a range of health service settings in a global context.

Objectives: The present study is the first to prospectively investigate whether self-reported health complaints and causal beliefs increase after the construction of a new power line. Methods: We used a quasi-experimental design with two pretests before and two posttests after a new HVPL was put into operation. Residents living near (0-300. m, n=229; 300-500. m, n=489) and farther away (500-2000. m, n=536) participated in the study. Linear mixed models were fitted to test whether symptom reports and beliefs that power lines caused health complaints increased more in residents living close to the new line compared to residents living farther away. Results: A significantly (. p<.05) larger increase from baseline in symptom reports and causal beliefs was found in residents living within 300. m from the new power line when compared to residents living farther away. While symptom reports did not differ at baseline, the belief that a power line could cause these symptoms was at baseline already stronger for residents living close compared to residents living farther away.

A neurophysiological surrogate of upper limb synergies, the selectivity ratio (SR), can be determined from the ratio of biceps brachii (BB) motor evoked potentials to transcranial magnetic stimulation prior to forearm pronation versus elbow flexion. Surprisingly, cathodal transcranial direct current stimulation (c-TDCS) over ipsilateral primary motor cortex (M1) reduces (i.e. improves) the SR in healthy adults, and chronic stroke patients. The ability to suppress antagonist muscles may be exacerbated at high movement rates. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether the selective muscle activation of the biceps brachii (BB) is dependent on altering frequency demands, and whether the c-tDCS improvement of SR is dependent on task frequency. Seventeen healthy participants performed repetitive isometric elbow flexion and forearm pronation at three rates, before and after c-tDCS or sham delivered to ipsilateral left M1. Ipsilateral c-tDCS improved the SR in a frequency dependent manner by selectively suppressing BB antagonist excitability.

Although many actions of TS have been researched, its vasodilator effects in pregnancy remain unknown. There have been a few studies that have shown the ability of TS to reduce blood pressure in women with hypertensive pregnancies; however, there are no studies which have examined the vascular effects of TS in the pregnant state in either normal or complicated pregnancies. Our aim was to determine the vasoactive role of TS in multiple arteries during pregnancy including: rat resistance (mesenteric and uterine) and conduit (carotid) arteries. Further, we aimed to assess the ability of TS to improve uterine blood flow in a rodent model of intrauterine growth restriction. Wire myography was used to assess vascular responses to the water-soluble derivative, sodium tanshinone IIA sulphonate (STS) or to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator, methylcholine. At mid-pregnancy, STS caused direct vasodilation of rat resistance (pEC50 mesenteric: 4.47±0.05 and uterine: 3.65±0.10) but not conduit (carotid) arteries. In late pregnancy, human myometrial arteries responded with a similar sensitivity to STS (pEC50 myometrial: 3.26±0.13). STS treatment for the last third of pregnancy in eNOS-/- mice increased uterine artery responses to methylcholine (Emax eNOS-/-: 55.2±9.2% vs. eNOS-/- treated: 75.7±8.9%, p&lt;0.0001). The promising vascular effects, however, did not lead to improved uterine or umbilical blood flow in vivo, nor to improved fetal biometrics; body weight and crown-rump length. Further, STS treatment increased the uterine artery resistance index and decreased offspring body weight in control mice.

Several databases provide metabolic reconstructions for different organisms. Software to analyze flux distributions exists, among others for the proprietary MATLAB environment. Given the large user community for the R computing environment, a simple implementation of flux analysis in R appears desirable and will facilitate easy interaction with computational tools to handle gene expression data. We extended the R software package BiGGR, an implementation of metabolic flux analysis in R. BiGGR makes use of public metabolic reconstruction databases, and contains the BiGG database and the reconstruction of human metabolism Recon2 as Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) objects. Models can be assembled by querying the databases for pathways, genes or reactions of interest. Fluxes can then be estimated by maximization or minimization of an objective function using linear inverse modeling algorithms. Furthermore, BiGGR provides functionality to quantify the uncertainty in flux estimates by sampling the constrained multidimensional flux space. As a result, ensembles of possible flux configurations are constructed that agree with measured data within precision limits. BiGGR also features automatic visualization of selected parts of metabolic networks using hypergraphs, with hyperedge widths proportional to estimated flux values. BiGGR supports import and export of models encoded in SBML and is therefore interoperable with different modeling and analysis tools. As an application example, we calculated the flux distribution in healthy human brain using a model of central carbon metabolism. We introduce a new algorithm termed Least-squares with equalities and inequalities Flux Balance Analysis (Lsei-FBA) to predict flux changes from gene expression changes, for instance during disease. Our estimates of brain metabolic flux pattern with Lsei-FBA for Alzheimer's disease agree with independent measurements of cerebral metabolism in patients.

Methods: We conducted and analyzed 27 in-depth personal interviews with key participants in NZ and Australia and international participants previously located in Australia, and analyzed records of meetings considering switches (2000-2013). Analysis of both sets of data entailed a heuristic qualitative approach that embraced the lead researcher's knowledge and experience. Results: The key themes identified were conservatism and political influences in Australia, and an open attitude, proactivity and flexibility in NZ. Pharmacist-only medicine schedules and individuals holding a progressive attitude were proposed to facilitate switch in both countries. A pharmacy retail group drove many switches in NZ ('third-party switch'), unlike Australia. Barriers to switch in both countries included small market sizes, funding of prescription medicines and cost of doctor visits, and lack of market exclusivity. In Australia, advertising limitations for pharmacist-only medicines reportedly discouraged industry from submitting switch applications. Perceptions of pharmacy performance could help or hinder switches. Conclusion: Committee and regulator openness to switch, and confidence in pharmacy appear to influence consumer access to medicines. The pharmacist-only medicine schedule in Australasia and the rise of third-party switch and flexibility in switch in NZ could be considered elsewhere to enable switch. ? 2015 Gauld et al.",,"Article; attitude to health; Australia; comparative study; consumer attitude; consumer health information; controlled study; data analysis; drug classification; funding; health care access; health care cost; human; medical information; medical service; New Zealand; outcome assessment; pharmacist attitude; prescription; qualitative analysis; clinical practice; drug substitution; economics; pharmacist; politics; prescription; psychology; statistics and numerical data; supply and distribution; utilization; non prescription drug; prescription drug; Australia; Drug Prescriptions; Drug Substitution; Humans; New Zealand; Nonprescription Drugs; Pharmacists; Politics; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prescription Drugs",2-s2.0-84925835182

There are many factors that may impact a couple's ability to conceive and one of these may be incorrect timing of intercourse. Conception is only possible from approximately five days before up to several hours after ovulation. Therefore, to be effective, intercourse must take place during this fertile period. 'Timed intercourse' is the practice of prospectively identifying ovulation and, thus, the fertile period to increase the likelihood of conception. Whilst timed intercourse may increase conception rates and reduce unnecessary intervention and costs, there may be associated adverse aspects including time consumption and stress. Ovulation prediction methods used for timing intercourse include urinary hormone measurement (luteinizing hormone (LH), estrogen), tracking basal body temperatures, cervical mucus investigation, calendar charting and ultrasonography. This review considered the evidence from randomised controlled trials for the use of timed intercourse on positive pregnancy outcomes. Objectives: To assess the benefits and risks of ovulation prediction methods for timing intercourse on conception in couples trying to conceive. Search methods: We searched the following sources to identify relevant randomised controlled trials, the Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, PubMed, LILACS, Web of Knowledge, the World Health Organization (WHO) Clinical Trials Register Platform and ClinicalTrials.gov. Furthermore, we manually searched the references of relevant articles. The search was not restricted by language or publication status. The last search was on 5 August 2014. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction or comparing different methods of ovulation prediction for timing intercourse against each other in couples trying to conceive. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data. The primary review outcomes were cumulative live birth and adverse events (such as quality of life, depression and stress). Secondary outcomes were clinical pregnancy, pregnancy (clinical or self-reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) and time to conception. We combined data to calculate pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Statistical heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. We assessed the overall quality of the evidence for the main comparisons using GRADE methods. Main results: We included five RCTs (2840 women or couples) comparing timed intercourse versus intercourse without ovulation prediction. Unfortunately one large study (n = 1453) reporting live birth and pregnancy had not published outcome data by randomised group and therefore could not be analysed. Consequently, four RCTs (n = 1387) were included in the meta-analysis. The evidence was of low to very low quality. Main limitations for downgrading the evidence included imprecision, lack of reporting clinically relevant outcomes and the high risk of publication bias. One study reported live birth, but the sample size was too small to draw any relevant conclusions on the effect of timed intercourse (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.16 to 3.41, 1 RCT, n = 17, very low quality).One study reported stress as an adverse event. There was no evidence of a difference in levels of stress (mean difference 1.98, 95 CI% -0.87 to 4.83, 1 RCT, n = 77, low level evidence). No other studies reported adverse events.Two studies reported clinical pregnancy. There was no evidence of a difference in clinical pregnancy rates (RR 1.10, 95% CI 0.57 to 2.12, 2 RCTs, n = 177, I2 = 0%, low level evidence). This suggested that if the chance of a clinical pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 16%, the chance of success following timed intercourse would be between 9% and 33%.Four studies reported pregnancy rate (clinical or self-reported pregnancy). Timed intercourse was associated with higher pregnancy rates compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction in couples trying to conceive (RR 1.35, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.71, 4 RCTs, n = 1387, I2 = 0%, very low level evidence). This suggests that if the chance of a pregnancy following intercourse without ovulation prediction is assumed to be 13%, the chance following timed intercourse would be between 14% and 23%. Subgroup analysis by duration of subfertility showed no difference in effect between couples trying to conceive for &lt; 12 months versus couples trying for ? 12 months. One trial reported time to conception data and showed no evidence of a difference in time to conception. Authors' conclusions: There are insufficient data available to draw conclusions on the effectiveness of timed intercourse for the outcomes of live birth, adverse events and clinical pregnancy. Timed intercourse may improve pregnancy rates (clinical or self-reported pregnancy, not yet confirmed by ultrasound) compared to intercourse without ovulation prediction. The quality of this evidence is low to very low and therefore findings should be regarded with caution. There is a high risk of publication bias, as one large study remains unpublished 8 years after recruitment finished. Further research is required, reporting clinically relevant outcomes (live birth, clinical pregnancy rates and adverse effects), to determine if timed intercourse is safe and effective in couples trying to conceive. ? 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,adverse event; clinical effectiveness; conception; disease duration; evidence based medicine; human; intermethod comparison; live birth; meta analysis; ovulation prediction; pregnancy; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk benefit analysis; safety; sample size; self report; sexual intercourse; subfertility; systematic review; adult; coitus; female; fertilization; infertility; ovulation detection; ovulation prediction; pregnancy rate; procedures; statistics and numerical data; time; Adult; Coitus; Female; Fertilization; Humans; Infertility; Live Birth; Ovulation Detection; Ovulation Prediction; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Rate; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Time Factors,2-s2.0-84942778800

There were some marked differences in content, structure and level of conviction of beliefs about ones own depression and the samples previously published beliefs about depression in general. There were also significant differences between the beliefs of demographic groupings. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported effectiveness of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs. The quality of the relationship with the prescribing doctor was positively related to a belief in chemical imbalance as a cause and negatively related to a belief in unemployment as a cause.Limitations The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bio-genetic explanations, since 83% reported that the medication reduced their depression. Conclusions People experiencing depression hold complex, multifactorial and idiosyncratic sets of beliefs about the causes of their own depression, apparently based at least in part on their own life experiences and circumstances. Exploring those beliefs may enhance the doctor-patient relationship and selection of appropriate treatment modality. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Antidepressants; Causal beliefs; Depression; Prognostic pessimism; Stigma,"antidepressant agent; antidepressant agent; adult; alcohol abuse; Article; demography; depression; drug efficacy; family stress; female; health belief; heredity; human; job stress; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; personal experience; self report; sex difference; unemployment; complication; cultural anthropology; depression; Depressive Disorder; doctor patient relation; epidemiology; family relation; human relation; life event; Mental Disorders; mental stress; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; Adult; Antidepressive Agents; Culture; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Life Change Events; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Physician-Patient Relations; Questionnaires; Sampling Studies; Stress, Psychological; Unemployment",2-s2.0-84916898594

The aim of this paper is to review the two new severity classifications, outline their differences, review validation studies, and identify gaps in knowledge to suggest a way forward. Methods A literature review was performed to identify the purposes and differences between the classifications. Validation studies and those comparing the two different classifications were also reviewed. Results The Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC) and the Determinants Based Classification (DBC) both rely on assessment of local and systemic factors. The differences between the classifications provides opportunities for further research to improve the accuracy and utility of severity classification. This includes understanding how best to tailor severity classification to setting (e.g. secondary or tertiary hospital) and purpose (e.g. clinical management or research). A key difference is that the RAC does not consider infected pancreatic necrosis an indicator of severe disease. There is also the need to develop methods for the accurate non-invasive diagnosis of infected necrosis and evaluation of the characteristics of organ dysfunction in relation to severity and outcome. Conclusion Further improvement in severity classification is possible and research priorities have been identified. For now, the decision as to which classification to use should be on the basis of setting, validity, accuracy, and ease of use. Copyright ? 2015, IAP and EPC.

However, limitations of standard therapies have highlighted the need for a convenient alternative treatment to effectively target the pathophysiologic basis of CF-related disease by improving mucociliary clearance of airway secretions and consequently improve lung function and reduce respiratory exacerbations. Mannitol is an osmotic agent available as a dry powder, dispensed in a convenient disposable inhaler device for the treatment of adult patients with CF. Inhalation of mannitol as a dry powder is thought to change the viscoelastic properties of airway secretions, increase the hydration of the airway surface liquid and contribute to increased mucociliary and cough clearance of retained secretions. In two large phase 3 studies [1, 2], long-term use of inhaled mannitol resulted in a significant and clinically meaningful improvement in lung function relative to control in adult CF subjects and had an acceptable safety profile. Clinical experience with inhaled mannitol confirms that it is safe and effective. A minority of patients are unable to tolerate the medication. However, through training in proper inhaler technique and setting clear expectations regarding therapeutic effects, both the tolerance and adherence necessary for long term efficacy can be positively influenced. Educational aims To discuss the importance of airway clearance treatments in the management of cystic fibrosis. To describe the clinical data that supports the use of mannitol in adult patients with cystic fibrosis. To highlight the role of mannitol tolerance testing in screening for hyperresponsiveness.

Despite regular societal debate in New Zealand about assisted dying, little is known about what the New Zealand public think about this issue. The present study was the first to examine New Zealanders' attitudes toward assisted dying in the context of various parameters of patient suffering, and as a public policy issue. Methods: Stratified random sampling techniques were used to elicit 677 participants from the electoral roll. They completed an anonymous questionnaire asking about the most appropriate medical response to patients who explicitly request assistance in dying, as well as their opinions around legalization of PAD. Results: Overall, 78% felt PAD was the most appropriate response in certain situations while 82% felt it should be legalized. When the patient was suffering from loss of dignity, PAD was considered the most appropriate response to patients' requests for assistance in dying by 75% of respondents; when the patient was suffering from intractable pain, 65% of respondents considered PAD the most appropriate response. Almost 65% of those who wanted PAD to be legalized felt it should only be accessible to those suffering unbearably with little hope of recovery, and 46% felt that the presence of mental illness should be an exclusionary factor. Conclusions: The results have highlighted the high value respondents place on patient autonomy with regards to end-of-life choices; however the choice to hasten death is not a right' that should be available to all. Results have clearly shown that New Zealanders believe regulation will play a key role in maintaining compliance with any assisted dying legislation, and in restricting access, so that only patients who are suffering intolerably and hopelessly are able to legally gain medical assistance to end their life. ?

Three of the eight facets of the WHOQOL-SRPB have been identified as potentially different from the others, and to date only a limited number of factor analyses of the instrument have been published. Methods: Analyses were conducted using data from a sample of 679 university students who had completed the WHOQOL-BREF quality of life questionnaire, the WHOQOL-SRPB module, the Perceived Stress scale, and the Brief COPE coping strategies questionnaire. Informed by these analyses, confirmatory factor analyses suitable for ordinal-level data explored the potential for a two-factor solution as opposed to the originally proposed one-factor solution. Results: The facets WHOQOL-SRPB facets connected, strength, and faith were highly correlated with each other as well as with the religious coping sub-scale of the Brief COPE. Combining these three facets to one factor in a two-factor solution for the WHOQOL-SRPB yielded superior goodness-of-fit indices compared to the original one-factor solution. Conclusions: A two-factor solution for the WHOQOL-SRPB is more tenable, in which three of the eight WHOQOL-SRPB facets group together as a spiritual coping factor and the remaining facets form a factor of spiritual quality of life. While discarding the facets connectedness, strength, and faith without additional research would be premature, users of the scale need to be aware of this alternative two-factor structure, and may wish to analyze scores using this structure. ? 2015 Krageloh et al.",Confirmatory factor analysis; Coping; Quality of life; Spiritual wellbeing; WHOQOL-SRPB,"Article; coping behavior; female; human; integration; male; optimism; Perceived Stress Scale; quality of life; questionnaire; Spiritualism; university student; World Health Organization Quality of Life Spirituality Religiousness and Personal Belief module; adaptive behavior; attitude to health; evaluation study; hope; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; religion; sense of coherence; standards; young adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Attitude to Health; Female; Hope; Humans; Male; Quality of Life; Sense of Coherence; Spirituality; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84924569065

The possible effects of high ambient temperature must be better understood, particularly in terms of certain diseases' sensitivity to heat (as reflected in relative risks [RR]) and the consequent disease burden (number or fraction of cases attributable to high temperatures), in order to manage the threat. Purpose: This study investigated the number of deaths attributable to abnormally high ambient temperatures in Seoul, South Korea, for a wide range of diseases. Method: The relationship between mortality and daily maximum temperature using a generalized linear model was analyzed. The threshold temperature was defined as the 90th percentile of maximum daily temperatures. Deaths were classified according to ICD-10 codes, and for each disease, the RR and attributable fractions were determined. Using these fractions, the total number of deaths attributable to daily maximum temperatures above the threshold value, from 1992 to 2009, was calculated. Data analyses were conducted in 2012-2013. Results: Heat-attributable deaths accounted for 3,177 of the 271,633 deaths from all causes. Neurological (RR 1.07; 95% CI, 1.04-1.11) and mental and behavioral disorders (RR 1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07) had relatively high increases in the RR of mortality. The most heat-sensitive diseases (those with the highest RRs) were not the diseases that caused the largest number of deaths attributable to high temperatures. Conclusion: This study estimated RRs and deaths attributable to high ambient temperature for a wide variety of diseases. Prevention-related policies must account for both particular vulnerabilities (heat-sensitive diseases with high RRs) and the major causes of the heat mortality burden (common conditions less sensitive to high temperatures). ? 2015 Kim et al.",,Article; asthma; atmospheric pressure; behavior disorder; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; climate change; diabetes mellitus; digestive system disease; endocrine disease; environmental temperature; heat sensitivity; high temperature; human; humidity; mental disease; metabolic disorder; meteorology; mortality; neurologic disease; nutritional disorder; respiratory tract disease; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; South Korea; summer; adverse effects; cause of death; epidemiology; heat; heat injury; Mental Disorders; Nervous System Diseases; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; urban population; Cause of Death; Heat Stress Disorders; Hot Temperature; Humans; Linear Models; Mental Disorders; Nervous System Diseases; Republic of Korea; Urban Population,2-s2.0-84923285877

Interventions during critical windows of developmental plasticity may prevent developmental programming in offspring. The effects of maternal supplementation with the anti-inflammatory lipid conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) on early-onset puberty, metabolic dysfunction, and estrous cycle dysfunction was assessed. Sprague- Dawley rats were randomly assigned to a purified control diet (CD; 10% kcal from fat), CD with CLA (CLA; 10% kcal from fat, 1% CLA), HF (45% kcal from fat) or HF with CLA (HFCLA; 45% kcal from fat, 1% CLA). Diets were fed ad libitum for 10 days prior to time mating and throughout gestation and lactation. Offspring plasma/tissues were taken at Day 24 (prepubertal) or Day 150 (adult). Puberty was assessed from Day 26 and estrous cycle from Day 128. Female offspring from HF mothers had lower birth weights but by Postnatal Day 24 had exhibited catch-up growth concomitant with increased fat mass, hyperleptinemia, and dyslipidemia. Maternal CLA supplementation reversed these effects. Early-onset puberty was only observed in HF offspring; this was reversed in HFCLA offspring. In adulthood, despite no evidence of glucose intolerance or altered insulin sensitivity, HF offspring displayed increased fat mass, dyslipidemia, disrupted estrous cyclicity. and hyperleptinemia; this was reversed by maternal CLA supplementation. Data presented in this study demonstrate the importance of diet in women of reproductive age and during pregnancy on reproductive and metabolic parameters in their offspring and that supplementation with CLA during critical windows of development may represent a therapeutic strategy in the prevention of early-life programming of metabolic and reproductive dysfunction. ? 2015 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.","CLA; Developmental origins of health and disease; Developmental programming; Early-onset puberty; Hyperlipidemia; Maternal high fat; Rodents (rats, mice, guinea pigs, voles)","conjugated linoleic acid; triacylglycerol; conjugated linoleic acid; leptin; adult; adulthood; age; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; birth weight; catch up growth; controlled study; diet supplementation; dyslipidemia; estrus cycle; fat mass; female; gene expression; glucose intolerance; glucose tolerance; gynecologic disease; hyperleptinemia; hyperlipidemia; insulin sensitivity; lactation; lipid diet; mating; metabolic disorder; metabolic parameters; nonhuman; obesity; perinatal period; precocious puberty; pregnancy; prepuberty; priority journal; progeny; puberty; rat; triacylglycerol blood level; animal; blood; diet supplementation; drug effects; Hyperlipidemias; lactation; lipid diet; maternal nutrition; metabolism; physiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; prevention and control; sexual maturation; Sprague Dawley rat; Cavia; Muridae; Mus; Rattus; Rodentia; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Dietary Supplements; Female; Hyperlipidemias; Lactation; Leptin; Linoleic Acids, Conjugated; Maternal Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sexual Maturation",2-s2.0-84929590097

Methods: Using laboratory-based surveillance data, invasive GAS isolates were identified from the Institute of Environmental Science and Research, New Zealand. Hospitalization and mortality data were obtained from the New Zealand Ministry of Health. Molecular typing was performed by sequence analysis of the emm gene. Results: The incidence of invasive GAS infections increased from 3.9 per 100,000 population in 2002 to 7.9 per 100,000 population (. P<0.001) in 2012. The incidence was highest in the over 75-year age group, and in Pacific peoples. There was temporal variation in emm types associated with invasive GAS disease, with emm1 being the overall predominant emm type. The diversity of emm types varied significantly according to ethnicity. Overall, 59% of GAS isolates were theoretically covered by an experimental M-protein vaccine. Conclusions: Our study provides valuable data on the epidemiology of invasive GAS disease in New Zealand, and represents one of the few studies to assess such longitudinal data across an entire nation.

We studied differences in adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy by ethnicity in a cohort of New Zealand women with breast cancer and its impact on breast cancer outcomes. Methods: We analysed data on women (n=1149) with newly diagnosed hormone receptor positive, non-metastatic, invasive breast cancer who were treated with adjuvant endocrine therapy in the Waikato during 2005-2011. Linked data from the Waikato Breast Cancer Registry and National Pharmaceutical Database were examined to identify differences by ethnicity in adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy and the effect of sub-optimal adherence on cancer recurrence and mortality. Results: Overall, a high level of adherence of ?80% was observed among 70.4% of women, which declined from 76.8% to 59.3% from the first to fifth year of treatment. M?ori women were significantly more likely to be sub-optimally adherent (<80%) compared with European women (crude rate 37% vs. 28%, p=0.005, adjusted OR = 1.51, 95% CI 1.04-2.17).

Conclusions: Sub-optimal adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy was a likely contributor for breast cancer mortality inequity between M?ori and European women, and highlights the need for future research to identify effective ways to increase adherence in M?ori women. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Breast cancer; Endocrine therapy; Ethnicity; Inequity; Medication adherence,"aromatase inhibitor; tamoxifen; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; aromatase inhibitor; tamoxifen; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer surgery; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease free survival; ethnic difference; European; female; human; major clinical study; Maori (people); medication compliance; New Zealand; patient compliance; survival rate; treatment outcome; very elderly; adjuvant chemotherapy; Breast Neoplasms; Caucasian; chemistry; ethnology; Kaplan Meier method; lymph node metastasis; middle aged; mortality; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Oceanic ancestry group; prospective study; register; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Aromatase Inhibitors; Breast Neoplasms; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lymphatic Metastasis; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Patient Compliance; Prospective Studies; Registries; Tamoxifen; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84920614775

The present study examines the interaction between obesity-related environmental factors and the pattern of migrant acculturation in a sample of 152 Iranian immigrants in Victoria, Australia. Weight measurements, demographics, physical activity levels and diet habits were also surveyed. The pattern of acculturation (relative integration, assimilation, separation or marginalization) was not related to body mass index, diet, or physical activity behaviours. Three relevant aspects of participants’ perception of the Australian environment (physically active environments, social pressure to be fit, unhealthy food environments) varied considerably by demographic characteristics, but only one (physically active environments) was related to a pattern of acculturation (assimilation). Overall, this research highlighted a number of key relationships between acculturation and obesity-related environments and behaviours for our study sample.

Adipokines, as mediators of metabolism and inflammation, may be a possible mechanism. The study aimed to investigate the effect of EN on adipokines early in the course of AP. Patients with AP were randomised to EN or nil-by-mouth (NBM). Blood samples were taken on the first 4 d of admission and adipokine concentrations for adiponectin, leptin, omentin, resistin and visfatin were determined by ELISA assays. A linear mixed model analysis was run to determine differences in adipokine concentrations between the two study groups. A total of thirty-two patients were included in the study. Omentin concentrations were significantly higher in patients who received EN compared with NBM across the first 4 d of admission (mean difference: 11.6 (95 % CI 1.0, 22.3) ng/ml; P = 0.033). Leptin concentrations were significantly higher in patients who received EN compared with NBM after adjusting for age, sex and BMI (mean difference: 2.3 (95 % CI 0.1, 4.5) ng/ml; P = 0.037). No significant difference in adiponectin, resistin or visfatin concentrations were observed between the two study groups. EN significantly increases omentin and leptin concentrations in AP. Future research should be directed towards understanding whether these adipokines are responsible for the therapeutic benefits of EN. ?

Here we observed that, in differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, decreased insulin signaling caused by blocking of insulin receptors (InsR) with an anti-InsR blocking antibody, increased rates of adiponectin secretion, whereas concomitant elevations in insulin levels counteracted this effect. Adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling regulated adiponectin production by modulating the expression of adiponectin receptors, the secretion of adiponectin, and eventually the expression of adiponectin itself. We found that lysyl hydroxylases (LHs) and prolyl hydroxylases (PHs) were expressed in white-adipose tissue of ob/ob mice, wherein LH3 levels were increased compared with controls. In differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes, both non-specific inhibition of LHs and PHs by dipyridyl, and specific inhibition of LHs by minoxidil and of P4H with ethyl-3,4-dihydroxybenzoate, caused significant suppression of adiponectin production, more particularly of the higher-order isoforms. Transient gene knock-down of LH3 (Plod3) caused a suppressive effect, especially on the high molecular-weight (HMW) isoforms. These data indicate that PHs and LHs are both required for physiological adiponectin production and in particular are essential for the formation/secretion of the HMW isoforms. ? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Adiponectin; Adipose tissue; Biosynthesis; Hormones; Molecular mechanisms; Post-translational modification,"adenylate kinase; adiponectin; adiponectin receptor; bipyridine; insulin; minoxidil; polymer; procollagen lysine 2 oxoglutarate 5 dioxygenase; procollagen proline 2 oxoglutarate 4 dioxygenase; protocatechuic acid; rosiglitazone; adiponectin; Adipoq protein, mouse; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; ethyl protocatechuate; hydroxybenzoic acid derivative; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase kinase; insulin; isoprotein; lysyl hydroxylase 3, mouse; minoxidil; procollagen lysine 2 oxoglutarate 5 dioxygenase; procollagen proline 2 oxoglutarate 4 dioxygenase; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; biosynthesis; cell differentiation; cellular distribution; competitive inhibition; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; gene silencing; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; hyperinsulinemia; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin metabolism; insulin response; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; obesity; phenotype; protein expression; protein localization; protein polymerization; protein processing; protein protein interaction; protein synthesis; signal transduction; tissue distribution; upregulation; weight gain; white adipose tissue; 3T3 cell line; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; drug effects; genetics; metabolism; mouse mutant; protein multimerization; signal transduction; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adiponectin; AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; Animals; Antihypertensive Agents; Hydroxybenzoates; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Mice; Mice, Obese; Minoxidil; Procollagen-Lysine, 2-Oxoglutarate 5-Dioxygenase; Prolyl Hydroxylases; Protein Isoforms; Protein Multimerization; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-84908566837

The economic evaluation took the perspective of the health care system and its patients, and compared costs encountered from the additional use of resources from time of randomisation until six weeks postpartum. Increments in health outcomes for both the woman and infant were considered in the cost-effectiveness analysis. Mean costs and effects in the treatment groups allocated at randomisation were compared, and incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and confidence intervals (95%) calculated. Bootstrapping was used to confirm the estimated confidence intervals, and to generate acceptability curves representing the probability of the intervention being cost-effective at alternative monetary equivalent values for the outcomes avoiding high infant birth weight, and respiratory distress syndrome. Analyses utilised intention to treat principles. Results: Overall, the increase in mean costs associated with providing the intervention was offset by savings associated with improved immediate neonatal outcomes, rendering the intervention cost neutral (Lifestyle Advice Group $11261.19±$14573.97 versus Standard Care Group $11306.70±$14562.02; p=0.094). Using a monetary value of $20,000 as a threshold value for avoiding an additional infant with birth weight above 4 kg, the probability that the antenatal intervention is cost-effective is 0.85, which increases to 0.95 when the threshold monetary value increases to $45,000. Conclusions: Providing an antenatal dietary and lifestyle intervention for pregnant women who are overweight or obese is not associated with increased costs or cost savings, but is associated with a high probability of cost effectiveness. Ongoing participant follow-up into childhood is required to determine the medium to long-term impact of the observed, short-term endpoints, to more accurately estimate the value of the intervention on risk of obesity, and associated costs and health outcomes. ? 2015 Dodd et al.",Cost effectiveness analysis; Dietary and lifestyle intervention; Health economics evaluation; Overweight and obesity; Pregnancy; Randomised trial,adult; Article; birth weight; body mass; bootstrapping; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; economic evaluation; female; follow up; gestational weight gain; health care system; health economics; hospital cost; hospital patient; human; length of stay; lifestyle; major clinical study; obesity; outpatient care; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal period; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; respiratory distress syndrome; Short Form 36,2-s2.0-85013267427

Indigenous people and those from lower socio-economic backgrounds are over-represented in obesity statistics. There is a need for evidence of effect of interventions for child obesity with long-term follow-up. Whether engaging with those that are more motivated to make lifestyle changes is a useful strategy has not been fully explored. We hypothesise that in obese/overweight children, assessed as psychologically ""ready for change"", delivery of a 12-month multi-disciplinary intervention programme results in a significant reduction in body mass index standard deviation score. Methods/Design: Whanau Pakari is an unblinded randomised controlled clinical trial comparing a 12 month intervention programme with standard practice, with 6 monthly assessments for 2 years, conducted in Taranaki, New Zealand (a region where 15.8 % of the population are indigenous). It specifically targets indigenous people and those in more deprived households. Obese/overweight children and adolescents aged 5-16 years are eligible. Exclusion criteria are medical/psychological conditions leading to inability to undertake physical activity/participate in group sessions; those not ""ready"" to make lifestyle changes; and those without a committed family member. Assessments of health parameters, dietary history, physical activity and overall health-related quality of life/psychological functioning are completed in the participant's home. Fasting blood tests are obtained at baseline, 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome is body mass index standard deviation score. Secondary outcomes include quality of life, dietary behaviour and physical activity, cardiovascular and metabolic profile (blood pressure, resting heart rate, waist circumference), glycaemic control (fasting glucose and glycated Haemoglobin), fasting insulin, and lipids. A general linear mixed model will be used to assess change from baseline using the 6, 12, 18 and 24 month measures, adjusting for age, gender, socioeconomic status and ethnicity, and whether at the contemplative or preparation/action stages of readiness for change. Discussion: This trial will inform the development of management programmes for obese children and adolescents that are appropriate for indigenous populations. It will investigate whether those at the preparation/action stage of ""readiness"" to make lifestyle changes are more successful in making changes than those who are contemplative. ? 2015 Anderson et al.",Body mass index; Indigenous people; Intervention studies; Nutrition; Obesity; Pediatric; Physical activity; Randomised controlled trials; Research methods; Whanau Pakari,glucose; glycosylated hemoglobin; insulin; adolescent; Article; blood examination; blood pressure measurement; body mass; child; child nutrition; childhood obesity; conception; consultation; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; glycemic control; household; human; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; male; nutritional assessment; outcome assessment; physical activity; priority journal; public health service; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; resting heart rate; social status; waist circumference,2-s2.0-85006192910

However, they are often underused because of degradation and chemical modifications occurring in the RNA that can present obstacles in downstream analysis. In routine medical care, FFPE material is examined and archived, therefore clinical collections of many types of cancers exist. It is beneficial to assess and record the quality of data that can be obtained from this type of material. The current study investigated three independent platforms and their ability to profile microRNAs (miRNAs) within FFPE samples from hepatoblastoma (HB) patients. Findings: Here we present three types of datasets consisting of miRNA profiles for 13 HB patients with different tumour types and molecular variations. The three platforms that were used to generate these data are: next-generation sequencing (Illumina MiSeq), microarray (Affymetrix? GeneChip? miRNA 3.0 array) and NanoString (nCounter, Human v2 miRNA Assay). The mature miRNAs identified are based on miRBase version 17 and 18. Conclusions: These datasets provide a global landscape of miRNA expression for a rare childhood cancer that has not previously been well characterised. These data could serve as a resource for future studies aiming to make comparisons of HB miRNA profiles and to document aberrant miRNA expression in this type of cancer. ? 2015 Leichter et al.",Epigenetics; FFPE; Hepatoblastoma; Microarray; MiRNA; NanoString; Next-generation sequencing; RNA expression,beta catenin; microRNA; microRNA; paraffin; Article; child; clinical article; embedding; gene expression; hepatoblastoma; human; human tissue; infant; microarray analysis; next generation sequencing; overall survival; polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; priority journal; recurrence free survival; school child; tissue fixation; biosynthesis; gene expression profiling; genetics; hepatoblastoma; high throughput sequencing; liver tumor; procedures; Gene Expression Profiling; Hepatoblastoma; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Paraffin Embedding; Tissue Fixation,2-s2.0-85006186511

Robots may be able to assist with day to day healthcare and provide companionship. This paper presents four case studies of older adults who had chronic health conditions in a rural community. They were given a healthcare robot in their homes for a period of three months to a year. The robot reminded people to take medications, had entertainment and memory games, and skype. Rates of hospitalizations, primary care visits, and phone calls to the medical practitioners before the study began were compared to rates during the study period. Participants also completed questionnaires about their quality of life, mental health, medication adherence, and robot attitudes and were interviewed. The results showed a decrease in primary care visits and phone calls to the practitioners while the robot was present and increases in quality of life were observed. Despite encountering technical issues, patients were mostly positive and accepting of the robot, acknowledging its benefits as a companion. ?

For this reason, psychophysical measures of global motion perception have been used to provide a behavioral measure of dorsal stream function. This approach assumes that global motion is relatively independent of visual functions that arise earlier in the visual processing hierarchy such as contrast sensitivity and visual acuity. We tested this assumption by assessing the relationships between global motion perception, contrast sensitivity for coherent motion direction discrimination (henceforth referred to as contrast sensitivity) and habitual visual acuity in a large group of 4.5-year-old children (n = 117). The children were born at risk of abnormal neurodevelopment because of prenatal drug exposure or risk factors for neonatal hypoglycemia. Motion coherence thresholds, a measure of global motion perception, were assessed using random dot kinematograms. The contrast of the stimuli was fixed at 100% and coherence was varied. Contrast sensitivity was measured using the same stimuli by fixing motion coherence at 100% and varying dot contrast. Stereoacuity was also measured. Motion coherence thresholds were not correlated with contrast sensitivity or visual acuity. However, lower (better) motion coherence thresholds were correlated with finer stereoacuity (ρ = 0.38, p = 0.004). Contrast sensitivity and visual acuity were also correlated (ρ = -0.26, p = 0.004) with each other. These results indicate that global motion perception for high contrast stimuli is independent of contrast sensitivity and visual acuity and can be used to assess motion integration mechanisms in children. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

A succession of studies in the mid-1990s reported a correlation between microemboli exposure and POCD and there followed a focus on microemboli reduction (along with other strategies) in pursuit of peri-operative neuroprotection. There is some evidence that the initiatives developed during this period were successful in reducing neurologic morbidity in cardiac surgery. More recently, however, there is increasing awareness of similar rates of POCD following on and off pump cardiac operations, and following many other types of surgery in elderly patients. This has led some to suggest that cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and microemboli exposure by implication are non-contributory. Although the risk factors for POCD may be more patient-centered and multifactorial than previously appreciated, it would be unwise to assume that CPB and exposure to microemboli are unimportant. Improvements in CPB safety (including emboli reduction) achieved over the last 20 years may be partly responsible for difficulty demonstrating higher rates of POCD after cardiac surgery involving CPB in contemporary comparisons with other operations. Moreover, microemboli (including bubbles) have been proven harmful in experimental and clinical situations uncontaminated by other confounding factors.

Setting: 2 large aged care facilities in Auckland, New Zealand, each providing low and high level care. Participants: All 161 residents of the facilities were invited to participate. The only exclusion criterion was inability to obtain consent from the individual or designated guardian. 88 participants were recruited- 66 females (75%), 22 males (25%) with average age 87.1 years (SD 5.5 years). Primary and secondary outcome measures: Primary-presence of significant skin disease (defined as that which in the opinion of the investigators needed treatment or was identified as a patient concern) diagnosed clinically on full dermatological examination by a dermatologist or dermatology trainee. Secondary-functional and cognitive status (Rehabilitation Complexity Scale and Abbreviated Mental Test Score). Results: 81.8% were found to have at least one significant condition. The most common disorders were onychomycosis 42 (47.7%), basal cell carcinoma 13 (14.8%), asteototic eczema 11 (12.5%) and squamous cell carcinoma in situ 9 (10.2%). Other findings were invasive squamous cell carcinoma 7 (8%), bullous pemphigoid 2 (2.3%), melanoma 2 (2.3%), lichen sclerosus 2 (2.3%) and carcinoma of the breast 1 (1.1%).

Methods Randomised, parallel-group, trial (ACTRN12612000914864) undertaken in Wakatipu/ Central Otago, New Zealand. Dependent adult daily smokers unmotivated to quit were randomly allocated to an intervention group provided with 12 weeks supply of free very low nicotine content (VLNC) cigarettes, or to a control group, who were free to purchase their usual cigarette brand over the same period. The primary outcome was change from baseline in the daily mean number of usual cigarettes smoked over the previous week, measured at 12 weeks. Secondary outcomes at 6 and 12 weeks included cigarettes smoked per week (also measured at weeks 1–6 and 9), salivary cotinine, tobacco dependence, smoking satisfaction/craving, behavioural addiction to smoking, autonomy over smoking, motivation to stop, price at which participants would purchase VLNC cigarettes, quitting and adverse events. Results Thirty-three smokers were randomised (17 intervention, 16 control). A NZ$15 price differential (per pack of 20) based on nicotine content led to a halving in the mean number of cigarettes smoked per day over the previous week, a reduction in tobacco dependence and an increase in quitting. Intervention participants smoked a similar total number of cigarettes (usual plus VLNC) as those in the control group, exposing them to a similar level of toxicants.

Maternal body mass index (BMI) and excessive weight gain during pregnancy are associated with delivery of LGA infants. However, whether maternal BMI and weight gain are associated with LGA infants in women with GDM is unclear. Basic procedures Data on 1049 pregnant women who developed GDM were collected from a university teaching hospital in China and retrospectively analyzed. Data included maternal BMI, weight gain, incidence of LGA and gestational week at diagnosis. Main findings The incidence of LGA infants was significantly associated with maternal BMI (p = 0.0002) in women with GDM. The odds of delivery of LGA for obese or overweight pregnant women are 3.8 or 2 times more than normal weight pregnant women. The incidence of LGA infants was also significantly associated with maternal weight gain in women with GDM. The odds ratio of delivery of LGA for pregnant women with excessive weight gain was 3.3 times more than pregnant women with normal weight gain. The effect of weight gain was not significantly different between different maternal BMI. Principal conclusion The incidence of delivery of LGA infants in Chinese women with GDM who were overweight or obese is higher than Caucasians, Hispanic, and Asian-Americans. The effects of maternal BMI and weight gain on the delivery of LGA infants by women with GDM are additive. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.

This study tested effectiveness of motivational interviewing (MI) for reducing stroke recurrence, measured by improving adherence to recommended medication and lifestyle changes compared with usual care. Methods - Single-blind, prospective phase III randomized controlled trial of 386 people with stroke assigned to either MI treatment (4 sessions at 28 days, 3, 6, and 9 months post stroke) or usual care; with outcomes assessed at 28 days, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post stroke. Primary outcomes were change in systolic blood pressure and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels as indicators of adherence at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included self-reported adherence, new stroke, or coronary heart disease events (both fatal and nonfatal); quality of life (Short Form-36); and mood (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale). Results - MI did not significantly change measures of blood pressure (mean difference in change, -0.2.35 [95% confidence interval, -6.16 to 1.47]) or cholesterol (mean difference in change, -0.0.12 [95% confidence interval, -0.30 to 0.06]). However, it had positive effects on self-reported medication adherence at 6 months (1.979; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-3.98; P=0.0557) and 9 months (4.295; 95% confidence interval, 1.56-11.84; P=0.0049) post stroke. Improvement across other measures was also observed, but the differences between MI and usual care groups were not statistically significant. Conclusions - MI improved self-reported medication adherence. All other effects were nonsignificant, though in the direction of a treatment effect. Further study is required to determine whether MI leads to improvement in other important areas of functioning (eg, caregiver burden). ? 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.",blood pressure; motivational interviewing; randomized controlled trial; secondary prevention; stroke,glycosylated hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adolescent; adult; Article; blood pressure measurement; cerebrovascular accident; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; ischemic heart disease; lifestyle modification; major clinical study; medication compliance; motivational interviewing; outcome assessment; patient compliance; phase 3 clinical trial; prescription; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; Short Form 36; single blind procedure; systolic blood pressure; clinical trial; female; male; motivational interviewing; patient compliance; procedures; psychology; risk reduction; secondary prevention; Stroke; Adult; Female; Humans; Male; Motivational Interviewing; Patient Compliance; Prospective Studies; Risk Reduction Behavior; Secondary Prevention; Single-Blind Method; Stroke,2-s2.0-84948085537

Methods: 25 adolescents (20 with significant depressive symptoms) who had trialled Rainbow SPARX took part in semi-structured interviews. The general inductive approach was used to analyse interview data. Results: Feedback consisted of five main themes: 'appealing aspects'; 'applying it to real life'; 'things to improve'; 'aspects that did not appeal'; and 'other themes'. Young people suggested that there should be more sexuality-specific ('rainbow') content in the computer program. Seventeen participants thought computerised therapy helped them feel better or less depressed. Conclusions: Consumer perspectives are increasingly being sought and this user input is especially useful for improving services. Our study provides important in-depth feedback on Rainbow SPARX from the perspective of sexual minority youth, and it highlights that computerised therapies can be successfully modified for groups traditionally under-served by mainstream mental health interventions. ?

Various source attribution models have been developed that utilize microbial subtyping data to assign cases of human NTS infection to different animal populations and foods of animal origin. Advances in molecular microbial subtyping approaches, in particular whole-genome sequencing, provide higher resolution data with which to investigate these sources. In this review, we provide updates on the source attribution models developed for Salmonella, and examine the application of whole-genome sequencing data combined with evolutionary modeling to investigate the putative sources and transmission pathways of NTS, with a focus on the epidemiology of NTS in Africa.

We hypothesized that MI depletion was due to changes in inositol metabolism and therefore examined the expression of genes regulating de novo biosynthesis, reabsorption, and catabolism of MI. We also extended the analyses from diabetes mellitus to animal models of dietary-induced obesity and hypertension. We found that renal MI depletion was pervasive across these three distinct disease states in the relative order: hypertension (-51%) > diabetes mellitus (-35%) > dietary-induced obesity (-19%). In 4-wk diabetic kidneys and in kidneys derived from insulin-resistant and hypertensive rats, MI depletion was correlated with activity of the MIdegrading enzyme myo-inositol oxygenase (MIOX). By contrast, there was decreased MIOX expression in 8-wk diabetic kidneys. Immunohistochemistry localized the MI-degrading pathway comprising MIOX and the glucuronate-xylulose (GX) pathway to the proximal tubules within the renal cortex. These findings indicate that MI depletion could reflect increased catabolism through MIOX and the GX pathway and implicate a common pathological mechanism contributing to renal oxidative stress in metabolic disease. ? 2015 the American Physiological Society.",Diabetes; Hypertension; Inositol; Insulin resistance; Kidney; MIOX; Myo-inositol; Obesity,"glucose; glucuronic acid; inositol; inositol oxygenase; xylulose; inositol; inositol oxygenase; Miox protein, rat; protein; xylulose; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biosynthesis; catabolism; controlled study; diabetic nephropathy; diet induced obesity; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; hypertension; immunohistochemistry; insulin blood level; insulin sensitivity; kidney function; kidney proximal tubule; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; Western blotting; animal; C57BL mouse; complication; deficiency; Diabetic Nephropathies; enzymology; experimental diabetes mellitus; genetics; hypertension; insulin resistance; metabolism; obesity; spontaneously hypertensive rat; Wistar Kyoto rat; Wistar rat; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetic Nephropathies; Hypertension; Inositol; Inositol Oxygenase; Insulin Resistance; Kidney Tubules, Proximal; Male; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity; Proteins; Rats, Inbred SHR; Rats, Inbred WKY; Rats, Wistar; Xylulose",2-s2.0-84946090964

Here, we estimated heritability of WML progression, and sought common genetic variants associated with WML progression in elderly participants from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium. Methods-Heritability of WML progression was calculated in the Framingham Heart Study. The genome-wide association study included 7773 elderly participants from 10 cohorts. To assess the relative contribution of genetic factors to progression of WML, we compared in 7 cohorts risk models including demographics, vascular risk factors plus single-nucleotide polymorphisms that have been shown to be associated cross-sectionally with WML in the current and previous association studies. Results-A total of 1085 subjects showed WML progression. The heritability estimate for WML progression was low at 6.5%, and no single-nucleotide polymorphisms achieved genome-wide significance (P&lt;5×10-8). Four loci were suggestive (P&lt;1×10-5) of an association with WML progression: 10q24.32 (rs10883817, P=1.46×10-6); 12q13.13 (rs4761974, P=8.71×10-7); 20p12.1 (rs6135309, P=3.69×10-6); and 4p15.31 (rs7664442, P=2.26×10-6). Variants that have been previously related to WML explained only 0.8% to 11.7% more of the variance in WML progression than age, vascular risk factors, and baseline WML burden. Conclusions-Common genetic factors contribute little to the progression of age-related WML in middle-aged and older adults. Future research on determinants of WML progression should focus more on environmental, lifestyle, or host-related biological factors. ? 2015 American Heart Association, Inc.",aging; biological factors; cerebral small vessel diseases; magnetic resonance imaging; white matter lesions,age; aged; Article; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; disease course; gender; gene locus; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; genotype; geriatric patient; heritability; human; major clinical study; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; white matter lesion; adult; female; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; Leukoencephalopathies; male; middle aged; pathology; procedures; prospective study; white matter; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Leukoencephalopathies; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; White Matter,2-s2.0-84945906100

Methods We reviewed renal outcomes and mortality for primary glomerulonephritis patients enrolled in the New Zealand Glomerulonephritis Study between 1972 and 1983. Results There were 765 patients with median follow-up of 30 years (range 0.1-42 years). They were predominantly New Zealand European, male and hypertensive. Poor renal outcomes and increased mortality were associated with hypertension, heavy proteinuria, impaired renal function and older age at diagnosis. Ethnicity was not significantly associated with progression to end-stage-kidney-disease although NZ Maori patients were at significantly increased risk of death. Patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis had the highest risk of reaching end-stage-kidney-disease while the cumulative incidence of end-stage-kidney-disease was 20% and 30% for those with immunoglobulin-A nephropathy and membranous nephropathy respectively. Mortality risk was high for patients with rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and anti-glomerular basement membrane disease. The era of diagnosis did not have much effect on outcomes except for patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis or immunoglobulin A nephropathy but this could be type II error. Conclusion We report one of the longest follow-up studies on biopsy-proven glomerulonephritides. Age, hypertension, and severity of chronic kidney disease at diagnosis were strong predictors of the development of end-stage-kidney-disease and death. The specific renal pathology had a profound impact upon prognosis and therefore should continue to drive efforts to find targeted therapeutic options for these glomerulonephritides. ? 2015 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology.",competing risks; end-stage kidney disease; long-term outcomes; mortality risk primary glomerulonephritis,"adult; aged; aging; controlled study; disease course; end stage renal disease; ethnicity; female; follow up; glomerulonephritis; human; hypertension; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; incidence; kidney function; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); membranous glomerulonephritis; mortality; New Zealand; outcome assessment; priority journal; proteinuria; retrospective study; Review; risk assessment; sex difference; adolescent; age; biopsy; comorbidity; glomerulonephritis; hypertension; Kaplan Meier method; Kidney Failure, Chronic; kidney transplantation; middle aged; proportional hazards model; renal replacement therapy; risk factor; severity of illness index; time factor; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Biopsy; Comorbidity; Disease Progression; Female; Glomerulonephritis; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Proportional Hazards Models; Renal Dialysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84945538051

Females are more likely to develop patellofemoral pain than males, yet the causes of this dimorphism are unclear. We used experimental data and computational modeling to determine whether patients with patellofemoral pain had elevated cartilage stress compared with pain-free controls and test the hypothesis that females exhibit greater cartilage stress than males. Methods We created finite element models of 24 patients with patellofemoral pain (11 males and 13 females) and 16 pain-free controls (8 males and 8 females) to estimate peak patellar cartilage stress (strain energy density) during a stair climb activity. Simulations took into account cartilage morphology from magnetic resonance imaging, joint posture from weight-bearing magnetic resonance imaging, and muscle forces from an EMG-driven model. Results We found no difference in peak patellar strain energy density between those with patellofemoral pain (1.9 ± 1.23 J·m-3) and control subjects (1.66 ± 0.75 J·m-3, P = 0.52). Females exhibited greater cartilage stress compared with males (2.2 vs 1.3 J·m-3, respectively; P = 0.0075), with large quadriceps muscle forces (3.7 body weight in females vs 3.3 body weight in males) and 23% smaller joint contact area (females, 467 ± 59 mm2, vs males, 608 ± 95 mm2). Conclusions Patients with patellofemoral pain did not display significantly greater patellar cartilage stress compared with pain-free controls; however, there was a great deal of subject variation. Females exhibited greater peak cartilage stress compared with males, which might explain the greater prevalence of patellofemoral pain in females compared with that in males, but other mechanical and biological factors are clearly involved in this complex pathway to pain. ? 2015 by the American College of Sports Medicine.",FINITE ELEMENT MODEL; JOINT STRESS; PATELLOFEMORAL PAIN; STAIR CLIMB,"adult; arthralgia; articular cartilage; computer simulation; female; human; male; mechanical stress; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; patellofemoral joint; pathology; pathophysiology; quadriceps femoris muscle; sex difference; young adult; Adult; Arthralgia; Cartilage, Articular; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Patellofemoral Joint; Quadriceps Muscle; Sex Factors; Stress, Mechanical; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84944323871

Objective: We explored the hypothesis that maternal adiposity (pre-pregnancy and at 26-28 weeks' gestation) and mid-pregnancy gestational weight gain (GWG) are independently associated with offspring size and adiposity in early childhood, and determined whether these effects are ethnicity dependent. Design: In a prospective mother-offspring cohort study (N = 976, 56% Chinese, 26% Malay, and 18% Indian), we assessed the associations of offspring size (weight, length) and adiposity (subscapular and triceps skinfolds), measured at birth and age 6, 12, 18, and 24 mo, with maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (ppBMI), mid-pregnancy GWG, and mid-pregnancy four-site skinfold thicknesses (triceps, biceps, subscapular, suprailiac). Results: ppBMI and mid-pregnancyGWGwere independently associated with postnatal weight up to 2 y and skinfold thickness at birth. Weight and subscapular and triceps skinfolds at birth increased by 2.56% (95% confidence interval, 1.68-3.45%), 3.85% (2.16-5.57%), and 2.14% (0.54-3.75%), respectively for every SD increase in ppBMI. Similarly, a one-SD increase in GWG increased weight and subscapular and triceps skinfolds at birth by 2.44% (1.66-3.23%), 3.28% (1.75-4.84%), and 3.23% (1.65-4.84%), respectively. ppBMI and mid-pregnancy suprailiac skinfold independently predicted postnatal skinfold adiposity up to 2 years of age, whereas only GWG predicted postnatal length. The associations of GWG with postnatal weight and length were present only among Chinese and Indians, but not Malays (P < .05 for interaction). Conclusions: ppBMI and GWG are independent modifiable factors for child size and adiposity up to 2 years of age. The associations are ethnic-dependent, and underscore the importance of ethnic specific studies before generalizing the applicability of risk factors reported in other populations.

Preterm birth reduced β-cell mass, apparent by 4 weeks after term and persisting to adulthood (12 mo), and was associated with reduced insulin secretion at 4 months (juvenile) and reduced insulin mRNA expression in adulthood. Hyperglycemia in preterm lambs further down-regulated key pancreatic gene expression in adulthood. These findings indicate that reduced β-cell mass after preterm birth may be an important factor in increased risk of diabetes after preterm birth and may be exacerbated by postnatal hyperglycemia. ? 2015 by the Endocrine Society.",,"glucocorticoid; glucokinase; incretin; insulin; somatomedin C; transcription factor PDX 1; glucose; insulin; somatomedin B; somatomedin C; adulthood; animal experiment; animal model; apoptosis; Article; B lymphocyte; cell maturation; cell proliferation; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; down regulation; gene expression; glucose tolerance; hyperglycemia; insulin infusion; insulin release; lamb; newborn disease; nonhuman; premature labor; priority journal; upregulation; animal; blood; cell count; chemically induced; cytology; genetics; hyperglycemia; immunohistochemistry; metabolism; newborn; pancreas; pancreas islet beta cell; prematurity; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sheep; sheep disease; time; veterinary; Animals; Animals, Newborn; Cell Count; Gene Expression; Glucocorticoids; Glucose; Hyperglycemia; Immunohistochemistry; Insulin; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Insulin-Like Growth Factor II; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Pancreas; Premature Birth; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sheep; Sheep Diseases; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84943603898

In this context, enhancing our understanding of the interaction of coronary structure and function is not only fundamental for advancing basic physiology but also crucial for identifying new targets for treating these diseases. A central challenge for understanding coronary blood flow is that coronary structure and function exhibit different behaviors across a range of spatial and temporal scales. While experimental studies have sought to understand this feature by isolating specific mechanisms, in tandem, computational modeling is increasingly also providing a unique framework to integrate mechanistic behaviors across different scales. In addition, clinical methods for assessing coronary disease severity are continuously being informed and updated by findings in basic physiology. Coupling these technologies, computational modeling of the coronary circulation is emerging as a bridge between the experimental and clinical domains, providing a framework to integrate imaging and measurements from multiple sources with mathematical descriptions of governing physical laws. State-of-the-art computational modeling is being used to combine mechanistic models with data to provide new insight into coronary physiology, optimization of medical technologies, and new applications to guide clinical practice. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"radioactive microsphere; ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide; acute coronary syndrome; angiocardiography; Article; blood flow velocity; blood flowmetry; blood viscosity; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; catheterization; computational fluid dynamics; computed tomographic angiography; contrast enhancement; coronary artery aneurysm; coronary artery blood flow; coronary artery circumflex branch; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; coronary artery pressure; coronary flow reserve; coronary sinus; dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; fractional flow reserve; heart contraction; heart cycle; heart function; heart hemodynamics; heart index; heart infarction; heart muscle blood flow; heart muscle perfusion; heart ventricle filling; heart ventricle pressure; human; in-stent restenosis; ischemic heart disease; left coronary artery; micro-computed tomography; microangiopathy; model; morphometrics; mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome; nonhuman; patient history of coronary artery bypass graft; percutaneous coronary intervention; positron emission tomography; right coronary artery; simulation; single photon emission computer tomography; three dimensional imaging; animal; biological model; coronary artery blood flow; coronary artery disease; coronary blood vessel; hemodynamics; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; Animals; Coronary Artery Disease; Coronary Circulation; Coronary Vessels; Hemodynamics; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Models, Cardiovascular; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",2-s2.0-84943585371

Objectives: To examine admissions to the neonatal unit, Edward Francis Small Teaching Hospital, Banjul, The Gambia and make recommendations for programme action to reduce mortality through improvements in the quality of care, particularly with respect to suspected neonatal infections. Methods: Case notes were reviewed for all neonates admitted to the neonatal unit during a 5-year period (1 January 2009 to 31 December 2013) to assess outcome and quality of care. Data for 2009 were subsequently excluded because of the low proportion of records retrieved. Results: Of the 4944 admissions between 1 January 2010 and 31 December 2013, 1734 infants (35%) died, with 57% of all deaths occurring within the first 48 hours of admission. There were 1267 early neonatal deaths (deaths occurring during the first 7 days of life), 67% of which occurred during the first 48 hours of life. Independent predictors of neonatal death in the multivariable analysis were; maternal lack of antenatal care, non-teaching hospital delivery, admission weight v1500g, abnormal blood glucose concentration (v2.6 mmol/L or w6.9 mmol/L) and hypothermia (axillary temperature v36. ? C). Forty-eight per cent of newborns had point-of-admission hypothermia. Possible severe bacterial infection (pSBI) accounted for 44% (2166/4944) of admissions, prematurity/low birthweight for 27% (1340/4944) and intrapartum-related conditions for 20%. Only 5% (104/2166) of pSBI cases had at least one supportive investigation; 41 had a chest radiograph, 26 had a blood culture and 43 had a lumbar puncture. Although 94% of the newborns received intravenous antibiotics, 55% of those who did lacked clinical evidence of pSBI and had no diagnostic work-up. Conclusion: Priority areas for action include infection prevention and improved diagnosis and management. There is also scope to reduce hypothermia with feasible interventions particularly targeting preterm infants. Improved patient records and audit data with linked action and accountability are interventions which could prevent such deaths of newborns in The Gambia and other developing countries. ? W. S.

These orthoses must be characterized by the naturally safe, reliable, and controlled motion of a human therapist's muscles. Such characteristics are only possible in the natural kingdom through the pain sensing realized by the interaction of an intelligent nervous system and muscles' embedded sensing organs. McKibben fluidic muscles or pneumatic muscle actuators (PMAs) are a popular orthosis actuator because of their inherent compliance, high force, and muscle-like load-displacement characteristics. However, the circular cross-section of PMA increases their profile. PMA are also notoriously unreliable and difficult to control, lacking the intelligent pain sensing systems of their biological muscle counterparts. Here the Peano fluidic muscle, a new low profile yet high-force soft actuator is introduced. This muscle is smart, featuring bioinspired embedded pressure and soft capacitive strain sensors. Given this pressure and strain feedback, experimental validation shows that a lumped parameter model based on the muscle geometry and material parameters can be used to predict its force for quasistatic motion with an average error of 10 - 15N. Combining this with a force threshold pain sensing algorithm sets a precedent for flexible orthosis actuation that uses embedded sensors to prevent damage to the actuator and its environment. ? 2015 SPIE.",Artificial muscle; Embedded sensing; Fluidic muscle; McKibben; Orthosis; Pain sensing; Peano; Soft actuator,Actuators; Capacitive sensors; Health; Muscle; Orthotics; Pneumatic equipment; Artificial muscle; Embedded sensing; Fluidic muscles; McKibben; Orthosis; Pain sensing; Peano; Soft actuators; Pneumatic actuators,2-s2.0-84943423701

Given that New Zealand has among the highest rates of child and adult obesity in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the aim of the current study was to document the prevalence of, and recent trends in, overweight, obesity, and severe obesity among adolescents in New Zealand. Methods: Data were collected as part of two nationally representative surveys in 2007 and 2012. In both surveys, a nationally representative group of students was selected to participate in the health and well-being surveys from a nationally representative sample of secondary schools. Across the two surveys, more than 17,000 students participated in the survey, which also included measured heights and weights. Results: In 2012, nearly 40% of adolescents in New Zealand were overweight, obese, or severely obese. Between 2007 and 2012, there were no decreases in the prevalence of obesity for the general population or any demographic subgroup. However, the prevalence of obesity and severe obesity for Pacific young people increased significantly. Of note, the prevalence of severe obesity for Pacific young people increased from 9% in 2007 to 14% in 2012. Conclusions: Findings from the current study indicate the need for an urgent investment in obesity prevention, particularly to address the growing inequalities in obesity for Pacific young people. ?

Although dysregulation of the GH-IGF axis in offspring is a known consequence of maternal UN, little is known about the efficacy of GH treatment during the period of developmental plasticity on later growth and metabolic outcomes. The present study investigated the effect of preweaning GH treatment on growth, glucose metabolism, and the GH-IGF axis in adult male and female offspring after maternal UN. Female Sprague Dawley rats were fed either a chow diet ad libitum (control [CON]) or 50% of ad libitum (UN) throughout pregnancy. From postnatal day 3, CON and UN pups received either saline (CON-S and UN-S) or GH (2.5 μg/g·d CON-GH and UN-GH) daily throughout lactation. At weaning, male and female offspring were randomly selected from each litter and fed a standard chow diet for the remainder of the study. Preweaning GH treatment normalized maternal UN-induced alterations in postweaning growth trajectory and concomitant adiposity in offspring. Plasma leptin concentrations were increased in UN-S offspring and normalized in the UN-GH group. Hepatic GH receptor expression was significantly elevated in UN-S offspring and normalized with GH treatment. Hepatic IGF binding protein-2 gene expression and plasma IGF-1 to IGF binding protein-3 ratio was reduced in UN-S offspring and elevated with GH treatment. GH treatment during a critical developmental window prevented maternal UN-induced changes in postnatal growth patterns and related adiposity, suggesting that manipulation of the GH-IGF-1 axis in early development may represent a promising avenue to prevent adverse developmental programming effects in adulthood.

Method: Databases were searched for empirical studies on self-disclosure and primary care published from 1946 to 28 November 2014, as well as references from primary studies. The search was extended to include working papers, theses, and dissertations. Results: Nine studies were identified, with response rates ranging from 34% to 100%, as well as several not reported. Self-disclosure occurred in 14-75% of consultations, the most from paediatricians. Self-disclosure had intended benefit; however, one standardised patient study found that 85% of self-disclosures were not useful as reported by the transcript coders. Conflicting data emerged on the self-disclosure outcome. Conclusion: This is the first systematic review of selfdisclosure in primary care and medicine. Selfdisclosure appears to be common and has the potential to be helpful when used judiciously.

Our aim was to determine whether sleep duration associates with growth outcomes during the first two years of life. Study design: Participants included 899 children enrolled in the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort study. Anthropometric data (weight and body length) and parental reports of sleep duration were collected at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. A mixed-model analysis was used to evaluate the longitudinal association of BMI and body length with sleep duration. In subgroup analyses, effects of ethnicity (Chinese, Indian, and Malay) and short sleep at three months of age (?12 h per day) were examined on subsequent growth measures. Results: In the overall cohort, sleep duration was significantly associated with body length (β = 0.028, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.002-0.053, p = 0.033), but not BMI, after adjustment for potential confounding factors. Only in Malay children, shorter sleep was associated with a higher BMI (β = -0.042, 95% CI -0.071 to -0.012, p = 0.005) and shorter body length (β = 0.079, 95% CI 0.030-0.128, p = 0.002). In addition, shorter sleep was associated with a higher BMI and shorter body length in children who slept ?12 h per day at three months of age. Conclusion: The association between sleep duration and growth outcomes begins in infancy.

University students are the group of people most likely to postpone parenthood, yet several international studies have shown that they overestimate their fertility. We designed a questionnaire based on a previous study in Israel, where university students were asked to answer questions related to their awareness of fertility decline in spontaneous and in vitro fertilisation (IVF) pregnancies, and methods they considered would prolong their reproductive lifespan. Our study has shown that New Zealand University students overestimated the rates of pregnancy for both spontaneous natural and IVF pregnancies. Students are mainly aware of the availability of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs), but overestimate their effectiveness. Few students mentioned non-medical or well-being initiatives as measures to prolong parenthood. It is important that university students are aware of the rate of fertility decline in women, as although ARTs can be effective at times, they are not a guaranteed solution to an ageing woman's fertility. New Zealand University students, like other cohorts, overestimated the chances of a woman getting pregnant and predicted the fertility decline to occur much later than it does in reality. ? 2015 The British Fertility Society.",fertility decline; IVF; natural pregnancy; university students,"adult; Article; awareness; female; female fertility; female subfertility; fertilization in vitro; groups by age; human; Israel; knowledge; male; middle aged; New Zealand; parenthood; pregnancy; questionnaire; reproductive health; university student; wellbeing; young adult; aging; attitude to health; fertility; fertilization in vitro; infertility therapy; physiology; pregnancy; student; university; Adult; Aging; Female; Fertility; Fertilization in Vitro; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; New Zealand; Pregnancy; Reproductive Techniques, Assisted; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84942309800

We describe a retrospective review of the first 12 months of Waikato Teledermatology (WT), a low-cost, secure, website-based, store-and-forward teledermatology network using the Collegium Telemedicus platform. Methods We determined specialist response time, referral metrics, patient diagnosis and progress reports from the network’s database. The programme’s value was evaluated by post-pilot online surveys of referrers and specialist dermatologists. Results WT was used by 31 referring doctors for 309 consultations with four dermatologists between July 2013 and June 2014. Mean and median specialist response time was 2.07 hours (range: 0.13–5.64 hours). The researchers categorized the referrals as tumours (56.8%) and rashes (43.2%), including inflammatory dermatoses (51.9%), infection (18.1%), uncertain (16.5%), miscellaneous (7.5%), and of environmental origin (6%). Thirty tumours were biopsied, including nine melanomas and three basal cell carcinomas. A total of 158 progress reports and 35 survey responses were received. Reported advantages included decreased delay, improved accuracy of diagnosis and treatment compared to that made without specialist input, decreased unnecessary procedures such as biopsies of undiagnosed conditions, and increased appropriate referrals for face-to-face assessment, thus leading to cost savings for the patient and the health care system. The major disadvantages were the time burden for clinicians to complete consultations, the lack of integration with the patients’ usual electronic medical record and absence of funding. Discussion WT proved an effective and acceptable approach to improving patient access to dermatologic services. ? 2015, ?

The appropriate timing, length, format and content of sessions were also investigated. Design: Eighty-three patients with HNC and 73 of their caregivers completed questionnaires at diagnosis. Follow-up questionnaires were mailed to patients six months later. Main outcome measures: Free text-comments to open-ended questions in the questionnaires were analysed using an inductive thematic approach with coding and theme development directed by the content of responses. This was used to determine psychological support needs both at diagnosis and at six month follow-up. Results: Patients described ‘just being there’, empathy, maintaining normality and practical support as helpful from family/friends. They desired information, honesty, positivity and empathy from clinical staff. Formal psychological support was desired by approximately 40% of patients and caregivers, particularly early after diagnosis and during treatment. Most participants desired face to face sessions, providing individualised information and coping strategies. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that psychological interventions for patients with HNC and their caregivers should be delivered early after diagnosis in face to face sessions, presenting honest and factual information about the disease and coping strategies. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.",caregivers; Head and neck cancer (HNC); intervention; patients; support,"adaptive behavior; adult; aged; caregiver; family; female; friend; Head and Neck Neoplasms; human; male; middle aged; needs assessment; psychology; qualitative research; questionnaire; social support; statistics and numerical data; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Caregivers; Family; Female; Friends; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Qualitative Research; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84941733529

To determine the inflammatory cell and matrix changes in advanced keratoconus, including acute hydrops, using immunohistochemical analysis. METHODS. The corneal tissue from eight subjects with keratoconus undergoing corneal transplantation (three keratoconic buttons, five buttons post acute hydrops—one of them with extensive neovascularization following hydrops) was compared with tissue from two normal corneoscleral rims (n = 10). The corneas were sectioned and analyzed with specific markers for macrophages, lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and scar associated matrix molecules laminin, fibronectin, tenascin-C, and type III collagen. RESULTS. Populations of cells using markers for macrophages, leucocytes and antigen presenting cells were found to be associated with the epithelium and stroma of keratoconic tissue. Populations of these cells appeared decreased in hydrops-associated keratoconus except for a large increase in leucocytes in the stroma and endothelium associated with neovascularization. Extracellular matrix deposition was found to be uniquely demonstrated in localized areas of the stroma, corresponding to the site of hydrops involvement. CONCLUSIONS. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed a chronic, inflammatory process with recruitment of immunoinflammatory cells and deposition of scar tissue in keratoconus. The inflammatory markers were somewhat attenuated in hydrops-associated keratoconus corneas and thus inflammation was not considered to be a major factor in the development of acute corneal hydrops. ? 2015 The Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology, Inc.",Hydrops cornea; Immunohistochemistry; Keratoconus; Microscopy,"CD11b antigen; CD45 antigen; collagen type 3; fibronectin; laminin; tenascin; biological marker; HLA DR antigen; lectin; leukocyte antigen; scleroprotein; acute hydrops; adolescent; adult; antigen presenting cell; Article; clinical article; controlled study; cornea edema; dendritic cell; extracellular matrix; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; inflammation; inflammatory cell; keratoconus; Langerhans cell; leukocyte; lymphocyte; macrophage; male; neovascularization (pathology); priority journal; stroma; young adult; acute disease; cornea; cornea edema; cytology; follow up; immunohistochemistry; immunology; keratoconus; metabolism; pathology; Acute Disease; Antigens, CD; Biomarkers; Cornea; Corneal Edema; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Follow-Up Studies; HLA-DR Antigens; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Keratoconus; Lectins, C-Type; Leukocytes; Macrophages",2-s2.0-84941331358

AIM: This study describes and compares New Zealand medical students, general practice registrars and general practitioners’ (GPs’) attitudes towards incorporating nutrition care into practice, and self-perceived skills in providing nutrition care. METHODS: A total of 183 New Zealand medical students, 51 general practice registrars and 57 GPs completed a 60-item questionnaire investigating attitudes towards incorporating nutrition care into practice and self-perceived skills in providing nutrition care. Items were scored using a 5-point Likert scale. Factor analysis was conducted to group questionnaire items and a generalised linear model compared differences between medical students, general practice registrars and GPs. RESULTS: All groups indicated that incorporating nutrition care into practice is important. GPs displayed more positive attitudes than students towards incorporating nutrition in routine care (p<0.0001) and performing nutrition recommendations (p<0.0001). General practice registrars were more positive than students towards performing nutrition recommendations (p=0.004), specified practices (p=0.037), and eliciting behaviour change (p=0.024). All groups displayed moderate confidence towards providing nutrition care. GPs were more confident than students in areas relating to wellness and disease (p<0.0001); macronutrients (p=0.030); micronutrients (p=0.010); and women, infants and children (p<0.0001). DISCUSSION: New Zealand medical students, general practice registrars and GPs have positive attitudes and moderate confidence towards incorporating nutrition care into practice. It is possible that GPs’ experience providing nutrition care contributes to greater confidence. Strategies to facilitate medical students developing confidence in providing nutrition care are warranted. ? 2015, Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners.

AIM: To estimate GP awareness of their GBM patients’ sexual orientation and examine whether HIV and STI screening was associated with this. METHODS: We analysed anonymous, self-completed data from 3168 GBM who participated in the community-based Gay Auckland Periodic Sex Survey (GAPSS) and internet-based Gay men’s Online Sex Survey (GOSS) in 2014. Participants were asked if their usual GP was aware of their sexual orientation or that they had sex with men. RESULTS: Half (50.5%) believed their usual GP was aware of their sexual orientation/behaviour, 17.0% were unsure, and 32.6% believed he/she was unaware. In multivariate analysis, GP awareness was signifi?cantly lower if the respondent was younger, Asian or an ‘Other’ ethnicity, bisexual-identified, had never had anal intercourse or had first done so very recently or later in life, and had fewer recent male sexual partners. GBM whose GP was aware of their sexual orientation were more likely to have ever had an HIV test (91.5% vs 57.9%; p<0.001), specific STI tests (91.7% vs 68.9%; p<0.001), and were twice as likely to have had an STI diagnosed. DISCUSSION: Lack of sexual orientation disclosure is resulting in missed opportunities to reduce health inequalities for GBM. More proactive, inclusive and safe environments surrounding the care of sexual orientation minorities are needed in general practice to encourage disclosure. ? 2015, Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners.

The Heart Exercise And Remote Technologies trial examined the effectiveness of an mHealth intervention to increase exercise behavior in adults with IHD. As a part of this trial, a process evaluation was conducted. METHODS: One hundred seventy-one adults with IHD were randomized to receive a 6-month mHealth intervention (n = 85) plus usual care or usual care alone (n = 86). The intervention delivered a theory-based, automated package of exercise prescription and behavior change text messages and a supporting Web site. Three sources of data were triangulated to assess intervention participant perceptions: (1) Web site usage statistics; (2) feedback surveys; and (3) semistructured exit interviews. Descriptive information from survey and Web data were merged with qualitative data and analyzed using a semantic thematic approach. RESULTS: At 24 weeks, all intervention participants provided Web usage statistics, 75 completed the feedback survey, and 17 were interviewed. Participants reported reading the text messages (70/75; 93%) and liked the content (55/75; 73%). The program motivated participants to exercise. Several suggestions to improve the program included further tailoring of the content (7/75; 7%) and increased personal contact (10/75; 13%). CONCLUSIONS: Adults with IHD were able to use an mHealth program and reported that text messaging is a good way to deliver exercise information. While mHealth is designed to be automated, programs might be improved if content and delivery were tailored to individual needs. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",cardiovascular disease; exercise; feedback; text messaging,adult; aged; Article; behavior change; controlled study; feedback system; female; follow up; heart muscle ischemia; heart rehabilitation; human; human computer interaction; Internet; major clinical study; male; mobile health exercise based heart rehabilitation; motivation; patient attitude; patient satisfaction; pedometer; physical activity; priority journal; program acceptability; randomized controlled trial (topic); text messaging; treatment planning; videorecording; web browser; health care survey; kinesiotherapy; middle aged; Myocardial Ischemia; program evaluation; randomized controlled trial; statistics and numerical data; telemedicine; Exercise Therapy; Female; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Ischemia; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Program Evaluation; Telemedicine,2-s2.0-84941008641

Background: Depression decreases an older person's quality of life and sense of wellness, and increases functional impairment. The positive role of nurses working with patients with long-term conditions is now being recognised internationally; however, there is a gap in the research about how nurses recognise depression in older patients and how this impacts on their practice. Design: This is a qualitative study informed by a constructivist grounded theory approach. Methods: In-depth telephone interviews were conducted with 40 nurses working in geographically diverse areas in New Zealand. Results: Having the conversation with older patients about their low moods, or specifically about depression was not something that all the nurses had, or felt they could have. While some nurses knew they could provide specific advice to patients, others believed this was not their responsibility, or within the scope of their role. Conclusion: Faced with an increasing number of older people with long-term conditions, one of which maybe depression itself or as a result of living with other long-term conditions, ongoing monitoring and support pathways are necessary to prevent further decline in the older person's quality of life and well-being.

However, it is unclear how serum HtrA1 changes in a normal pregnancy and whether it is altered in PE pregnancies. Methods A sandwich ELISA highly specific to human HtrA1 and suitable for serum detection was developed and thoroughly validated. This assay was then applied to serum samples from different stages of normal pregnancy, as well as early-onset (<34 weeks) and late-onset (>34 weeks) PE pregnancies. Results Serum HtrA1 increased progressively with increasing gestation in normal pregnancies. However, this trend was perturbed in women with PE. Compared to respective gestation-age-matched normal pregnancies, HtrA1 serum levels were significantly increased in early-onset PE, but significantly reduced in late-onset PE. Discussion This is the first report to show a clear increase of HtrA1 in the maternal circulation during normal pregnancy, consistent with HtrA1 being highly expressed in the placenta. Importantly, this study identified that serum HtrA1 was altered differently in early-onset and late-onset PE pregnancies, highlighting the complex regulation of HtrA1 in the different subtypes. The significant increase of serum HtrA1 in early-onset PE suggests that it may be a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of early-onset PE at disease presentation. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods Between 1973 and 2011, women with SLE and a history of pregnancy were identified using linked Swedish population registries. The outcome was death from primarily cardiovascular causes, defined as death from acute coronary syndrome or coronary artery disease, stroke, or peripheral vascular disease. The exposure was MPS, defined as any hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, stillbirth, placental abruption, or delivery of a small-for-gestational-age infant. The association of preterm delivery (delivery at <34 weeks of gestation) with death from cardiovascular causes was also explored. Risk of death from cardiovascular causes was determined using logistic regression, adjusting for the year of first delivery, duration of SLE, number of inpatient admissions, and cardiovascular risk factors. Results A total of 3,977 women with SLE had 7,410 pregnancies during the study interval. Death from primarily cardiovascular causes occurred in 44 of the 325 women who died (13.5%). The median age at death from cardiovascular causes was 54 years (interquartile range 48-58 years), and these women were more likely to have had hypertension and renal disease. MPS was associated with an increased risk of death from primarily cardiovascular causes (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.19 [95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.14-4.22]), specifically, a history of placental abruption (adjusted OR 5.78 [95% CI 1.61-20.72]). Delivery at <34 weeks of gestation, particularly when combined with MPS, was also associated with an increased risk of death from primarily cardiovascular causes (adjusted OR 2.49 [95% CI 1.06-5.85]). Conclusion MPS in pregnancy is associated with a higher risk of death from primarily cardiovascular causes in women with SLE. ? 2015, American College of Rheumatology.",,"acute coronary syndrome; adult; Article; body mass; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary artery disease; disease association; disease duration; female; human; kidney disease; major clinical study; maternal hypertension; maternal mortality; maternal placental syndrome; outcome assessment; peripheral vascular disease; pregnancy complication; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; retrospective study; risk assessment; small for date infant; solutio placentae; stillbirth; Sweden; systemic lupus erythematosus; Abruptio Placentae; cardiovascular disease; Fetal Growth Retardation; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; middle aged; mortality; newborn; Pre-Eclampsia; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; register; risk; Abruptio Placentae; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Cardiovascular Diseases; Coronary Artery Disease; Female; Fetal Growth Retardation; Humans; Hypertension, Pregnancy-Induced; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Stillbirth; Stroke; Sweden",2-s2.0-84940121908

Methods: This is a retrospective review of pseudophakic postkeratoplasty eyes after implantation of a custom-designed, sulcus-fixated, supplementary ""piggyback"" IOL to correct refractive errors. The outcome measures included preoperative and postoperative uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA), spectacle-corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), refractive correction, and complications. Results: This study evaluated 10 eyes (10 patients) with previous penetrating or deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty with a mean follow-up period of 12.2 ± 10.7 months (range, 2-33 months). All eyes showed improved UDVA postoperatively with 70% achieving ?20/40. Median UDVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) improved from 1.2 (20/280, range 20/70-20/2000) preoperatively to 0.3 (20/40, range 20/20-20/60) postoperatively at the latest follow-up visit (P < 0.01). Five eyes (50%) had improvement in CDVA by at least 1 line of Snellen acuity with all eyes achieving ?20/40 and 70% achieving ?20/25. Median CDVA (logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution) was 0.2 (20/30, range 20/20-20/50) preoperatively compared with 0.1 (20/25, range 20/20-20/40) postoperatively (P 0.03). In 8 eyes that received toric secondary IOLs, the mean refractive astigmatism decreased by 84% from 5.7 diopters (D) (range, 4-9 D) to 0.9 D (range, 0.2-3.0 D) (P 0.01). Postoperative refractive astigmatism was ±1 D of predicted astigmatism for 7 of 8 eyes. No eyes lost any lines of UDVA or CDVA, and there were no keratoplasty rejection/failure events. Conclusions: Implantation of a supplementary, sulcus-based IOL is an effective approach to reduce spherical and astigmatic refractive errors in pseudophakic eyes after keratoplasty. ?

Method: A literature review was performed in common electronic databases (Medline, PubMed, Springer Link, Embase, Science Direct, and Google Scholar). We identified original studies published between 1999 and 2011 relating to access to and use of HCMs. Three hundred and seventy four relevant articles were found. Forty-three original articles matched inclusion criteria. Results: We categorized access barriers into three levels: health system, regional/hospital, and patient levels. Barriers to access included the affordability of the healthcare system, the decision-making process for funding HCMs and eligibility criteria for access, geographic variation in funding and access, communication between physicians and patients, and patient out of pocket costs. Conclusion: Barriers to access HCMs are inter-related. These barriers are also relevant for other medicines but are escalated in the case of HCMs. Overall, healthcare systems are facing barriers related to high out-of-pocket cost for patients and/or barriers regarding the decision-making process and the effects of reimbursement decisions (i.e., restricted, delayed or denied access, particularly the latter for socialized systems with a universal coverage scheme). Inadequate access to HCMs may lead to subsequent use of unnecessary medical treatments. Barriers to access HCMs can also lead to treatment disparities between patients who can overcome these barriers and those who cannot. Improvements in the decision-making process can increase acceptance of the need to prioritize access to HCMs. ? 2015 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine.",Affordability; Decision-making; Reimbursement; Stakeholder perspective,doctor patient relation; funding; geographic distribution; health care access; health care cost; health care disparity; health care need; hospital patient; human; interpersonal communication; medical decision making; outpatient; physician attitude; priority journal; reimbursement; Review; social acceptance,2-s2.0-84939653121

This study used administrative data linked at the individual level for a cohort of Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ) children to follow and extend a model developed by Drake et al. In this investigation, we aimed to build an understanding of the high representation of indigenous NZ children in administratively sourced measures of CA/N. Variation in rate ratios (RRs) within infant mortality and birth outcomes considered as possible proxies for actual CA/N RRs leaves open a range of interpretations. Our findings indicate that a more nuanced interpretation of the overrepresentation of indigenous children in administratively recorded maltreatment statistics is required. Rather than considering risk and bias as competing explanations, we suggest an acknowledgment of the impact of colonization and the existence of systemic bias generating increased risk as key drivers. As linked administrative data are increasingly used for research and evaluation, and considered for use in supporting decision making, there is a need for a deeper understanding of the drivers of administratively recorded CA/N in order to effectively address the needs of indigenous populations. ?

This article investigated the role of physical vs. attention conspicuity in preventing bicycle crashes involving a motor vehicle in New Zealand. Methods: The Taupo Bicycle Study involved 2590 adult cyclists recruited in 2006 (43.1% response rate) and followed for bicycle crash outcomes through linkage to four national databases. A composite measure of physical conspicuity was created using latent class analysis based on the use of fluorescent colours, lights and reflective materials, and the main colour of top, helmet and bike frame. Attention conspicuity was assessed based on regional differences in travel patterns and the amount of riding in a bunch. Cox regression modelling for repeated events was performed with multivariate adjustments. Results: During a median follow-up period of 6.4 years, 162 participants experienced 187 bicycle-motor vehicle crashes. The crash risk was not predicted by the four latent classes identified and the amount of bunch riding but was higher in Auckland, the region with the lowest level of bicycle use relative to car use. In subgroup analyses, compared to other latent classes, the most physically conspicuous group had a higher risk in Auckland but a lower risk in other regions. Conclusion: Conspicuity aids may not be effective in preventing bicycle-motor vehicle crashes in New Zealand, particularly in Auckland, where attention conspicuity is low. ? 2014 The Author 2014.

Both the well-being of the mother and fetus need to be considered, and management can be challenging. The optimal management of women with a pheochromocytoma or paraganglioma in pregnancy is not well established. Objective: The objective of the study was to assess whether there is a difference in fetal or maternal mortality between pheochromocytomas and paragangliomas in pregnancy. Design: We present an experience of eight pregnancies in four SDHB germline mutation-positive women with sympathetic paragangliomas, followed by a systematic review of the literature to compare the outcome of paragangliomas with that of pheochromocytomas occurring in pregnancy. Results: In our case series, favorable fetal and maternal outcomes were seen in all eight pregnancies. From the systematic review, maternal and fetal mortality were lower in women with paragangliomas, at 3.6% and 12% respectively, compared with 9.8% and 16% in women with pheochromocytomas. Conclusion: Pregnant women with paragangliomas may be at a lower risk of adverse outcome than those with pheochromocytomas, but both maternal and fetal mortality rates are still higher than that of the general obstetric population.

However, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are identified by GWAS, especially those that fall outside of gene regions, do not always clearly link to the underlying biology. Despite this, these SNPs have often been validated through re-sequencing efforts as not just tag SNPs, but as causative SNPs, and so must play a role in disease development or progression. In this study, we show how the 3D genome (spatial connections) and trans-expression Quantitative Trait Loci connect diabetes loci from different GWAS meta-analyses, informing the backbone of regulatory networks. Our findings include a three-way functional-spatial connection between the TM6SF2, CTRB1-BCAR1, and CELSR2-PSRC1 loci (rs201189528, rs7202844, and rs7202844, respectively) connected through the KCNIP3 and BCAR1/BCAR3 loci, respectively.

To improve its diagnosis, C-reactive protein (CRP) has been proposed as a benchmark. The aim of this study was to evaluate discriminative power of CRP against white cell count (WCC) in AC. Methods This was a retrospective cohort study. Over a 5-y period, 1959 patients were identified from the audit of cholecystectomies. The exclusion criteria were coexisting acute surgical conditions, absence of blood tests within 3 d before hospital admission for elective surgery, and private patients. Results The eligibility criteria were met by 1843 patients. Comparison of the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve of CRP and WCC in acute on chronic, edematous, necrotic, suppurative, and gangrenous AC showed a better discriminative power of CRP. Both tests performed equally well in patients with pericholecystic abscess and gallbladder perforation. CRP was superior than WCC in mild AC, AUC = 0.93 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.9-0.95) and 0.79 (95% CI, 0.74-0.84), P < 0.00005, in moderate and severe AC, AUC = 0.99 (95% CI, 0.97-1.0) and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.88-0.97), P = 0.009, and in all forms of AC combined, AUC = 0.94; (95% CI, 0.92-0.97) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.79-0.87), respectively, P < 0.00005.

Methods: Predicted odds of melanoma were estimated by analyzing a pooled dataset from 16 case-control studies using logistic random coefficients models. Risk categories were defined based on the distribution of the predicted odds in the controls from these studies. Imputation was used to estimate missing data in the pooled datasets. The 30th, 60th, and 90th centiles were used to distribute individuals into four risk groups for their age, sex, and geographic location. Crossvalidation was used to test the robustness of the thresholds for each group by leaving out each study one by one. Performance of the model was assessed in an independent UK case-control study dataset. Results: Cross-validation confirmed the robustness of the threshold estimates. Cases and controls were well discriminated in the independent dataset [area under the curve, 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.73-0.78]. Twenty-nine percent of cases were in the highest risk group compared with 7% of controls, and 43% of controls were in the lowest risk group compared with 13% of cases. Conclusion: We have identified a composite score representing an estimate of relative risk and successfully validated this score in an independent dataset. Impact: This score may be a useful tool to inform members of the public about their melanoma risk. ? 2015 American Association for Cancer Research.",,adult; algorithm; Article; attributable risk; cancer risk; case control study; Caucasian; controlled study; cutaneous melanoma; family history; female; hair color; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; population distribution; priority journal; sun exposure; sunburn; validation study; melanoma; methodology; risk factor; Skin Neoplasms; Algorithms; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Melanoma; Research Design; Risk Factors; Skin Neoplasms,2-s2.0-84938582672

Studies on volleyball and baseball players report infraspinatus atrophy in 4% to 34% of players; however, the prevalence of infraspinatus atrophy in professional tennis players has not been reported. Purpose: To investigate the incidence of isolated infraspinatus atrophy in professional tennis players and to identify any correlations with other physical examination findings, ranking performance, and concurrent shoulder injuries. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: A total of 125 professional female tennis players underwent a comprehensive preparticipation physical health status examination. Two orthopaedic surgeons examined the shoulders of all players and obtained digital goniometric measurements of range of motion (ROM). Infraspinatus atrophy was defined as loss of soft tissue bulk in the infraspinatus scapula fossa (and increased prominence of dorsal scapular bony anatomy) of the dominant shoulder with clear asymmetry when compared with the contralateral side. Correlations were examined between infraspinatus atrophy and concurrent shoulder disorders, clinical examination findings, ROM, glenohumeral internal rotation deficit, singles tennis ranking, and age. Results: There were 65 players (52%) with evidence of infraspinatus atrophy in their dominant shoulders. No wasting was noted in the nondominant shoulder of any player. No statistically significant differences were seen in mean age, left- or right-hand dominance, height, weight, or body mass index for players with or without atrophy. Of the 77 players ranked in the top 100, 58% had clinical infraspinatus atrophy, compared with 40% of players ranked outside the top 100. No associations were found with static physical examination findings (scapular dyskinesis, ROM glenohumeral internal rotation deficit, postural abnormalities), concurrent shoulder disorders, or compromised performance when measured by singles ranking. Conclusion: This study reports a high level of clinical infraspinatus atrophy in the dominant shoulder of elite female tennis players. Infraspinatus atrophy was associated with a higher performance ranking, and no functional deficits or associations with concurrent shoulder disorders were found. Team physicians can be reassured that infraspinatus atrophy is a common finding in high-performing tennis players and, if asymptomatic, does not appear to significantly compromise performance. ?

Methods: A subset of 173 full-term newborn infants from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) birth cohort underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure the dimensions of the internal eye. Eye shape was assessed by an oblateness index, calculated as 1 - (axial length/width) or 1 - (axial length/height). Cycloplegic autorefraction (Canon Autorefractor RK-F1) and optical biometry (IOLMaster) were performed 3 years later. Results: Both eyes of 173 children were analysed. Eyes with longer axial length at birth had smaller increases in axial length at 3 years (p < 0.001). Eyes with larger baseline volumes and surface areas had smaller increases in axial length at 3 years (p < 0.001 for both). Eyes which were more oblate at birth had greater increases in axial length at 3 years (p < 0.001). Using width to calculate oblateness, prolate eyes had smaller increases in axial length at 3 years compared to oblate eyes (p < 0.001), and, using height, prolate and spherical eyes had smaller increases in axial length at 3 years compared to oblate eyes (p < 0.001 for both). There were no associations between eye size and shape at birth and refraction, corneal curvature or myopia at 3 years. Conclusions: Eyes that are larger and have prolate or spherical shapes at birth exhibit smaller increases in axial length over the first 3 years of life.

Global distribution patterns suggest that diet and lifestyle factors may be linked to the development and progression of this cancer. Twenty men with diagnosed prostate cancer adhered to aMediterranean diet, with specific adaptations, for three months. Prostate-specific antigen, C-reactive protein and DNA damage were evaluated at baseline and after three months of following the diet. Dietary data were collated from diet diaries and an adaptation of a validatedMediterranean diet questionnaire. A significant reduction in DNA damage compared to baseline was apparent, with particular benefit noted for overall adherence to the diet (p = 0.013), increased intake of folate (p = 0.023), vitamin C (p = 0.007), legumes (p = 0.004) and green tea (p = 0.002). Higher intakes of red meat and dairy products were inversely associated with DNA damage (p = 0.003 and p = 0.008 respectively). The results from this small feasibility study suggest that a high-antioxidant diet, modelled on Mediterranean traditions, may be of benefit for men with prostate cancer. Protection against DNA damage appears to be associated with the diet implemented, ostensibly due to reduction in reactive oxidant species. These findings warrant further exploration in a longer trial, with a larger cohort. ? 2015 Erdrich et al.",Antioxidants; DNA damage; Mediterranean style diet; Nutrition; Prostate cancer,acetylsalicylic acid; antioxidant; ascorbic acid; C reactive protein; folic acid; olive oil; prostate specific antigen; adaptation; adult; aged; Article; chicken; clinical article; dairy product; disease association; DNA damage; follow up; genotype; Gleason score; human; legume; lifestyle; male; Mediterranean diet; pilot study; pomegranate juice; prostate cancer; questionnaire; red meat; red wine; tea; vegetable,2-s2.0-84935456083

Study Design and Setting Data came from 167 clinical trial patients with unresectable (advanced) hepatocellular carcinoma. The global health status/QoL scale of the questionnaire contained two items: overall health and overall QoL. Nordin and Hinz proposed summary scores for the questionnaire. A mixed-effect model was fitted to estimate trends in scores over time. Results Predominantly the individual scale scores declined over time; however, the global health status/QoL score was stable [rate of change = -0.3 per month; 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.2, 0.6]. Nordin's summary score, which gave equal weight to the 15 questionnaire scales, and Hinz's summary score, which gave equal weight to the 30 questionnaire items, showed a statistically significant decline over time, 3.4 (95% CI: -4.5, -2.4) and 4.2 (95% CI: -5.3, -3.0) points per month, respectively.

Adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy (ET) influences breast cancer survival. Because ETside effects are frequently cited as reasons for nonadherence, understanding how perceptions and motivations in relation to ET are associated with symptom attribution can help promote timely symptom management. Materials and Methods. Participants were 2,086 breast cancer survivors recruited through the Army of Women registry who were current tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor (AI) users. Participants reported whether they were bothered by each of 47 symptoms during the past month and whether they thought each symptom was related to taking ET. Frequencies of overall symptoms and symptoms attributed and misattributed to ET were calculated, and linear regression was used to assess sociodemographics, emotions, and illness perceptions as predictors of symptoms attributed to ET. Results. Women attributed a mean of 8.9 symptoms and misattributed a mean of 1.5 symptoms to ET. In the multivariable analysis, younger age, a more recent diagnosis, AI use (vs. tamoxifen), anxiety, depressive symptoms, more ET-related negative emotions, more concern about long-term ETuse, and greater perceived ET necessity were independently associated with attribution of more symptoms to ET. More perceived ET necessity was associated with correctly attributing symptoms to ET, whereas higher depressive symptoms and more concern about ETuse were associated with misattribution of symptoms to ET. Conclusion. Given that many women perceive a range of symptoms as a consequence of ET, attention to these symptoms may reduce symptom burden and improve quality of life, potentially improving ET adherence and optimizing survival. ?

Recently, however, the obesity crisis has raised this relationship to a new level of attention. At the risk of simplifying things, there are two ‘positions’ that seem to characterize the discourse regarding this new relationship. One position considers that the main mission of PE should now be the ‘war on obesity’. Advocates for this instrumental position tend to do research, using interventionist strategies focusing on (H)PE as a site for the promotion of physical activity. The other position argues strongly for the foregrounding of educational purposes for (H)PE and tends to pursue research by means of sociocultural research paradigms such as phenomenology, poststructuralism or critical theory. Importantly, these ‘positions’ draw on different literatures and discourses. Seldom do the advocates of these two positions speak to each other and, if and when they do, they seem to speak different languages. In this paper, I discuss the notion of academic discourse and explore, with some examples from conferences, how the conventions of academic discourse are (mis)understood and accordingly confound the development of more considered responses to the relationship between health and PE. ? 2013, Taylor & Francis.",Academic discourse; Discourse; Health; Interdisciplinarity; Physical education,,2-s2.0-84930924377

However, researchers have observed high inter-study and inter-individual variability in IGT performance in healthy participants, and many are classified as impaired using standard criteria. Additionally, while decision-making deficits are often attributed to atypical sensitivity to reward and/or punishment, the IGT lacks an integrated sensitivity measure. Adopting an operant perspective, two experiments were conducted to explore these issues. In Experiment 1, 50 healthy participants completed a 200-trial version of the IGT which otherwise closely emulated Bechara et al.'s (1999) original computer task. Group data for Trials 1-100 closely replicated Bechara et al.'s original findings of high net scores and preferences for advantageous decks, suggesting that implementations that depart significantly from Bechara's standard IGT contribute to inter-study variability. During Trials 101-200, mean net scores improved significantly and the percentage of participants meeting the ""impaired"" criterion was halved. An operant-style stability criterion applied to individual data revealed this was likely related to individual differences in learning rate. Experiment 2 used a novel operant card task-the Auckland Card Task (ACT)-to derive quantitative estimates of sensitivity using the generalized matching law. Relative to individuals who mastered the IGT, persistent poor performers on the IGT exhibited significantly lower sensitivity to magnitudes (but not frequencies) of rewards and punishers on the ACT. Overall, our findings demonstrate the utility of operant-style analysis of IGT data and the potential of applying operant concurrent-schedule procedures to the study of human decision making. ? 2015 Bull, Tippett and Addis.",Decision making; Iowa Gambling Task; Learning rate; Operant psychology; Sensitivity to reward and punishment,,2-s2.0-84930651597

Genetic alterations are widely recognized as the main drivers of oncogenic transformation. Of considerable interest are mutations affecting the writers of epigenetic marks. In this review, we focus on histone methyltransferases-enzymes that catalyze the methylation of lysine residues in core histones. Histone methylation is a tightly controlled mechanism that is responsible for both activating as well as repressing gene expression in a site-specific manner, depending on which lysine residue is methylated. Histone methyltransferases, including MLL1, DOT1L, EZH2, and SETD2 are recurrently deregulated in human leukemia, either directly by gene mutations or balanced translocations, or indirectly as components of protein complexes that are disturbed in leukemia due to alterations of the other components in these complexes. Several small molecule inhibitors of histone methyltransferases are currently being clinically evaluated for their therapeutic potential in human leukemia. These drugs reverse some of the adverse effects of aberrant histone methylation, and can induce differentiation and cell death in leukemic blasts. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc..",Cancer; Epigenetics; Histone methylation; Histone methyltransferases; Leukemia,"1 [3 [[5 (4 amino 5 bromo 7h pyrrolo[2,3 d]pyrimidin 7 yl) 3,4 dihydroxytetrahydro 2 furfuryl](isopropyl)amino]propyl] 3 (4 tert butylphenyl)urea; 3 deazaneplanocin A; antileukemic agent; ei 1; epz 004777; epz 005687; gsk 126; gsk 2816126; gsk 343; gsk 926; histone demethylase; histone methyltransferase; lysine; mixed lineage leukemia protein; mixed lineage leukemia protein 1; mm 102; mm 401; pinometostat; protein DOT1L; protein SETD2; tazemetostat; transcription factor EZH2; unclassified drug; DOT1L protein, human; enzyme inhibitor; EZH2 protein, human; histone; histone lysine methyltransferase; histone methyltransferase; lysine; methyltransferase; mixed lineage leukemia protein; MLL protein, human; polycomb repressive complex 2; Set2 protein, human; amino terminal sequence; apoptosis; base pairing; binding site; cancer genetics; carboxy terminal sequence; cell cycle arrest; chromosome translocation; copy number variation; drug potency; drug synthesis; epigenetics; follicular lymphoma; gain of function mutation; gene duplication; gene expression; gene frequency; gene mutation; gene repression; gene silencing; gene structure; genetic transcription; histone methylation; human; large cell lymphoma; leukemia; leukemogenesis; malignant transformation; myelodysplastic syndrome; myeloproliferative neoplasm; nonhuman; nucleosome; priority journal; protein domain; protein function; protein localization; protein motif; protein processing; protein targeting; Review; somatic mutation; transcription initiation; antagonists and inhibitors; cell transformation; chemistry; gene translocation; genetics; leukemia; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Enzyme Inhibitors; Enzyme Inhibitors; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Histones; Histones; Humans; Humans; Leukemia; Leukemia; Lysine; Lysine; Methyltransferases; Methyltransferases; Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein; Myeloid-Lymphoid Leukemia Protein; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Translocation, Genetic; Translocation, Genetic",2-s2.0-84930577272

Methods 22-year retrospective review of medical records of children with moderate to severe visual impairment registered with the Blind and Low Vision Education Network New Zealand. The cohort was divided into two periods (1991-2004; 2005-2012) for analysis. Results 232 children with ROP were treated in the study period (109 in period 1, 123 in period 2). 36 children, 63.9% of whom were of male sex, were identified with subsequent significant visual impairment (27 in period 1, 9 in period 2). The incidence of new cases of visual impairment from ROP declined from 271.6 infants/100 000 live very preterm births per annum (period 1) to 146.1 per annum (period 2).

Methods National patient-level routine data on admissions with a principal diagnosis of COPD (mostly ICD-10-AN J440 & J441) were obtained for the period July 1st 2008 to June 30th 2013. Admissions with length of stay (LOS) ? 90 days were excluded. Results There were 61,516 admissions in 5 years. Admission rates and budget impact (in 2012/13 dollar values) were stable but the average length of stay (ALOS) declined from 5.09 to 4.37 days. In FY2012/13 the admission rate was 2.82 per 1000 population, with age standardised rate (ASR) 4.4- and 3.6-fold higher for M?ori and Pacific peoples respectively than for European/others. For age ? 15 years the ASR was 2.55 per 1000. Admission rates were higher for men than women and increased steeply with age and socioeconomic deprivation (NZDep06). The mean age at discharge was lower for M?ori and Pacific peoples than for European/Others (63.4, 67.1 and 72.3 years). The mean 30-day readmission rate was 6.7%. The average LOS increased with age and was shorter for M?ori (3.6 days) and Pacific peoples (3.5 days) than for European/Others (4.7 days). Admission rates varied widely across District Health Boards, and were higher in rural than urban regions. The estimated cost of admissions in FY2012/13 was $NZ59.6m. Conclusions Hospital admissions for COPD are costly and are over-represented in high risk groups including rural, elderly, socioeconomically deprived and M?ori and Pacific peoples.

Method 400 randomly selected women with infants between the ages of 6 weeks and 4 months were sent a postal questionnaire asking about their knowledge and infant care practices related to SUDI risk factors. Included were questions on sleep position, bed sharing, room sharing, smoking, and breastfeeding. Results were compared with a similar survey conducted in 2005. Results There were 172 (43%) responses. Compared with 2005, more women in this survey cited avoiding bed sharing, keeping the face clear, avoiding soft bedding, and room sharing as SUDI prevention factors. Compared with 2005, more mothers usually used the supine sleep position and shared the parental bedroom, while fewer mothers reported smoking. Eight percent said the infant usually shared a bed, down from 15% in 2005. Of the five main protective factors promoted by New Zealand’s Ministry of Health (supine sleep, own bed, room sharing, smoke free, breastfeeding), 43% were implementing all of these practices. Conclusion There has been an increased knowledge of SUDI risk factors. Also evident are an increase in supine positioning and room sharing and a decrease in smoking and bed sharing. These results suggest possible reasons for the falling rate of SUDI in New Zealand. ?

Modifications in infant care practices based on the avoidance of risk factors identified from a consistent epidemiological profile across time and multiple locations have resulted in dramatic reductions in the incidence of SUDI and SIDS in particular. The definition of SIDS (or unexplained SUDI) has been continually refined allowing enhanced multidisciplinary research, results of which can be more reliably compared between investigators. These latter expanded definitions mandating death scene investigations, evaluation of the circumstances of death and more comprehensive autopsies including additional ancillary testing have illuminated the importance of life-threatening sleep environments. The triple-risk hypothesis for SIDS has been increasingly validated and formulates an inextricable relationship between an infant's state of development, underlying pathological vulnerability and an unsafe sleep environment for sudden infant death to occur. Today, the major risk factors for SUDI are maternal smoking and bed sharing, and the challenge is to implement effective strategies that will reduce the exposure to such risks as was done with prone sleeping position. The challenges ahead include development of clinical methods and/or laboratory testing that will accurately identify which infants are at particularly high risk of SIDS but also means by which their deaths can be prevented. ? 2015 The Authors.

This difference could be related to differences in their acute effects on serum Ca. We therefore examined the effects of Ca from different sources on serum Ca and phosphate in a randomised, cross-over trial of ten women (mean age of 69 years). Fasting participants received a single dose of 500 mg of Ca as citrate, citrate with a meal, fortified juice or a dairy product meal, with at least 6 d between each intervention. Blood was sampled before and 1, 2, 4 and 6 h after each intervention was ingested. Serum ionised and total Ca increased significantly from baseline over 6 h. Using calcium citrate fasting as a comparator, the elevations in ionised and total Ca were similar after fortified juice, delayed after calcium citrate with a meal and smaller after a dairy product meal. Serum phosphate and calcium-phosphate product increased from baseline after calcium citrate with a meal and after a dairy product meal, and they declined after calcium citrate fasting and after fortified juice. The elevations in serum Ca in the present study were only slightly different from those observed after the administration of 1000 mg of Ca in a previous study. These data indicate that different sources of Ca have different acute effects on serum Ca and support recommendations that dietary Ca might be safer than supplements. Whether these differences contribute to differences in cardiovascular risk requires further study. Copyright ?

Drawings can be used to assess patients' perceptions about their disease. We aimed to explore the utility of the drawing test and its relation to illness perceptions and quality of life (QoL) in patients after long-term remission of acromegaly. Design: A cross-sectional study was conducted to evaluate the utility of the drawing test. Methods: A total of 50 patients after long-term remission (mean±S.E.M., 16±1.2 years) of acromegaly were included in this study. Patients completed the drawing test (two retrospective drawings of their body perception before acromegaly and during the active phase of acromegaly, and one drawing on the current condition after long-term remission), Illness Perception Questionnaire-Revised, Physical Symptom Checklist, EuroQoL-5D, and AcroQoL. Results: Patients perceived a dramatic change in body size during the active state of the disease compared with the healthy state before the awareness of acromegaly. Patients reported that their body did not completely return to the original proportions after long-term remission. In addition, larger drawings indicated more negative consequences (P<0.05), a higher score on emotional representations (P<0.05), and more perceived symptoms that were attributed to acromegaly (P<0.01). Larger drawings also indicated more impaired QoL, especially disease-specific QoL (all P<0.05). Conclusion: There are strong correlations among the drawing test, illness perceptions, and QoL. The drawing test appears to be a novel and relatively easy tool to assess the perception of patients after long-term remission of acromegaly. The assessment of drawings may enable health care providers to appreciate the perceptions of patients with long-term remission of acromegaly, and enable discussion of symptoms and remission. ? 2015 European Society of Endocrinology.",,acromegaly; AcroQoL; adult; Article; attitude to illness; body image; body size; checklist; clinical article; cross-sectional study; disease control; drawing; emotion; EQ 5D VAS; EuroQoL 5D; female; human; Illness Perception Questionnaire Revised; male; Physical Symptom Checklist; priority journal; psychologic test; quality of life; quality of life assessment; remission; acromegaly; aged; follow up; middle aged; neuropsychological test; patient satisfaction; psychology; questionnaire; retrospective study; self concept; socioeconomics; young adult; Acromegaly; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Retrospective Studies; Self Concept; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84929508132

The aim of this systematic review was to determine whether early closure of a defunctioning loop ileostomy (<2 weeks from index operation) is safe and reduces stoma-related morbidity. A systematic literature search was conducted using Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Collaboration, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL?) databases to identify all publications from January 1996 to March 2014 that reported the outcomes of early ileostomy closure. The following search terms (and their variations) were used as both medical subject headings (MeSH terms) and text words: ileostomy, surgical stoma, stoma, early, reversal, closure. No language restrictions were applied. The main outcomes of interest were stoma-related complications and postclosure complications. Studies that included pediatric patients (<18 years of age), small cohorts (<10 participants), case reports, conference abstracts, reviews, and letters; studies involving defunctioning colostomies or other types of small bowel stomas; and studies where results from closure of an ileostomy at >14 days could not be separated from early closure results were excluded. Where multiple studies were reported by the same institution and/or authors, only the most recent was included. This search strategy identified 4 studies (2 retrospective case series, 1 prospective nonrandomized study, and 1 randomized controlled trial), yielding a pooled population of 142 patients, ages 18-89 years old. Three studies reported indication for ileostomy; colorectal cancer accounted for 96 patients (78%). Time to ileostomy closure ranged from 8-14 days. No reported deaths were related to ileostomy closure. Wound infections were reported in 3 studies and were the most common complications, affecting 24 patients (19.8%). Of the 2 studies that reported ileostomy-related complications, 4 patients (3.6%) experienced a stoma-related complication before closure. Ileus or small bowel obstruction (SBO) occurred in 7 patients (4.9%). Compared to traditionally timed closure (8-12 weeks), reported stoma-related complication rates were lower in patients undergoing early closure. Both mortality and ileus/SBO rates also compare favorably with traditionally timed closure; however, wound infection rates appear to be increased. Additional studies to accurately define which individuals stand to benefit from early closure, as well as to further evaluate the impact of early ileostomy closure on quality of life and health care costs, are warranted. ? 2015, HMP Communications LLP.

BQA data covered approximately half all early breast cancers diagnosed in NZ during roll-out of the BQA program in 1998-2010. Coverage increased progressively to about 80% by 2008. This is the biggest NZ breast cancer database outside the NZ Cancer Registry and it includes cancer and clinical management data not collected by the Registry. We used these BQA data to compare socio-demographic and cancer characteristics and survivals by ethnicity. Materials and Methods: BQA data for 1998-2010 diagnoses were linked to NZ death records using the National Health Index (NHI) for linking. Live cases were followed up to December 31st 2010. Socio-demographic and invasive cancer characteristics and disease-specific survivals were compared by ethnicity. Results: Five-year survivals were 87% for Maori, 84% for Pacific, 91% for other NZ cases and 90% overall. This compared with the 86% survival reported for all female breast cases covered by the NZ Cancer Registry which also included more advanced stages. Patterns of survival by clinical risk factors accorded with patterns expected from the scientific literature. Compared with Other cases, Maori and Pacific women were younger, came from more deprived areas, and had larger cancers with more ductal and fewer lobular histology types. Their cancers were also less likely to have a triple negative phenotype. More of the Pacific women had vascular invasion. Maori women were more likely to reside in areas more remote from regional cancer centres, whereas Pacific women generally lived closer to these centres than Other NZ cases. Conclusions: NZ BQA data indicate previously unreported differences in breast cancer biology by ethnicity. Maori and Pacific women had reduced breast cancer survival compared with Other NZ women, after adjusting for socio-demographic and cancer characteristics. The potential contributions to survival differences of variations in service access, timeliness and quality of care, need to be examined, along with effects of co-morbidity and biological factors.",Australia and New Zealand; Breast cancer; Ethnicity; Risk factors; Survival,"epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; tumor marker; adult; aged; breast tumor; cancer staging; clinical audit; comorbidity; enzyme immunoassay; ethnic group; female; follow up; health care quality; human; lung carcinoma; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; New Zealand; Paget nipple disease; pathology; prognosis; register; risk factor; socioeconomics; surgeon; survival rate; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Ductal, Breast; Carcinoma, Lobular; Clinical Audit; Comorbidity; Ethnic Groups; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; New Zealand; Prognosis; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen; Receptors, Progesterone; Registries; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Surgeons; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-84929191048

Sixty green space reserves were chosen in New Zealand's largest city and separated into six site categories to determine the influence of site location, soil depth, underlying substrate, canopy cover, and distance from roads and central business district on soil heavy metals. Soils in native urban forests had the lowest pools (g m-2) of heavy metals compared with green spaces close to high-traffic, park, school, industrial and residential areas. Least variability in heavy metals was determined among forest sites, with variability increasing in the order: residential, school, industrial, park, and high-traffic sites. Using forest sites as a baseline, a 'pollution index' (PI) was established and deemed high for nickel, cadmium and copper and moderate for arsenic, zinc, chromium, lead and mercury. The mean 'integrated' PI was high at 3.3 (range 0.3-9.3), indicating elevated levels of soil pollution. The PI was considered a useful technique for interpreting data and complemented traditional ways of reporting concentrations of heavy metals through use of soil pools, which has been limited to date. This study provides important heavy metal data for use in determining where resources may be required to mitigate future risk of increased soil pollution. ?

Escherichia coli (E. coli) has been traditionally used as the default expression host to over-express and purify proteins from many different organisms. E. coli does, however, have known shortcomings for obtaining soluble, properly folded proteins suitable for downstream studies. These shortcomings are even more pronounced for the mycobacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis, with typically only one third of proteins expressed in E. coli produced as soluble proteins. Mycobacterium smegmatis (M. smegmatis) is a closely related and non-pathogenic species that has been successfully used as an expression host for production of proteins from various mycobacterial species. In this review, we describe the early attempts to produce mycobacterial proteins in alternative expression hosts and then focus on available expression systems in M. smegmatis. The advantages of using M. smegmatis as an expression host, its application in structural biology and some practical aspects of protein production are also discussed. M. smegmatis provides an effective expression platform for enhanced understanding of mycobacterial biology and pathogenesis and for developing novel and better therapeutics and diagnostics. ? 2014 The Protein Society.",expression system; Mycobacterium leprae; Mycobacterium smegmatis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; protein production; recombinant protein; shuttle vectors,"acetamidase; bacterial enzyme; bacterial protein; bacterial vector; chaperone; penicillinase; recombinant protein; tetracycline; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; recombinant protein; bacterial gene; bacterial strain; Baculoviridae; gene expression system; host; host cell; insect; Mycobacterium smegmatis; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein function; protein processing; protein purification; protein structure; Review; Streptomyces; chemical structure; chemistry; gene vector; genetics; metabolism; molecular cloning; Mycobacterium; Mycobacterium smegmatis; procedures; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli; Mycobacterium leprae; Mycobacterium smegmatis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Bacterial Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Genetic Vectors; Models, Molecular; Mycobacterium; Mycobacterium smegmatis; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Recombinant Proteins",2-s2.0-84928948369

Phylodynamics has been successfully applied to many different processes, such as the spread of infectious diseases, within-host evolution of a pathogen, macroevolution and even language evolution. Phylodynamic analysis requires a probability distribution on phylogenetic trees spanned by the genetic data. Because such a probability distribution is not available for many common stochastic population dynamic processes, coalescent-based approximations assuming deterministic population size changes are widely employed. Key to many population dynamic models, in particular epidemiological models, is a period of exponential population growth during the initial phase. Here, we show that the coalescent does not well approximate stochastic exponential population growth, which is typically modelled by a birth–death process. We demonstrate that introducing demographic stochasticity into the population size function of the coalescent improves the approximation for values of R0 close to 1, but substantial differences remain for large R0. In addition, the computational advantage of using an approximation over exact models vanishes when introducing such demographic stochasticity. These results highlight that we need to increase efforts to develop phylodynamic tools that correctly account for the stochasticity of population dynamic models for inference. ? 2015 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

Challenges within this work environment (e.g. workload, staffing levels, resources) may impact on healthcare staffs’ willingness to undertake formal palliative care education. The study described herein explored factors (socioenvironmental and psychological) that influence staff willingness to engage in palliative care education. Methods: The predictors of palliative care education uptake for healthcare staff (n = 431) from 52 New Zealand RAC facilities in one large urban District Health Board were assessed. Logistic regression was used to explore willingness to engage in education. Results: Higher scores for burnout predicted a decreased likelihood of engaging in palliative care education (odds ratio (OR) 0.41, P = 0.01). The identified predictor of willingness to engage in education was previous palliative care experience (OR 1.59, P = 0.027). Discussion: These results can inform the design and delivery of future palliative care education programmes within RAC. ? W. S.

A mutated and dysregulated form of JAK2, a tyrosine kinase, is associated with several diseases including Crohn's disease. Using an in vitro, time-resolved fluorescence (TR-FRET) assay, we tested 49 different types of food extracts, plus 10 concentrated fractions of increasing hydrophobicity from each extract, to find foods containing JAK2 inhibitors. The food extracts tested included grains, meat, fish, shellfish, dairy products, herbs, mushrooms, hops, fruits and vegetables. Several fruits were potent inhibitors of JAK2: blackberry, boysenberry, feijoa, pomegranate, rosehip and strawberry, which all contain ellagitannins, known inhibitors of kinases. These fruits are in the Rosales and Myrtales plant orders. No other foods gave >1% of the maximal JAK2 inhibitory activities of these fruits. AMPK, a sensor and regulator of energy metabolism in cells, is a serine-threonine kinase which is reported to be activated by various flavonoid phytochemicals. Using a TR-FRET assay, we tested various fruit extracts for AMPK activation and inhibition. Ellagitannin containing foods scored highly as AMPK inhibitors.

Compared with facility-based dialysis, dialysis performed by the patient at home is associated with higher quality of life, freedom, survival and reduced healthcare costs. International guidelines recommend suitable patients are offered a choice of dialysis modality, including home-based dialysis. Predialysis education and offering patients choice increase home dialysis uptake, yet the factors that patients and families are willing to trade off in making decisions about dialysis location are not well understood. The Home First study will explore patients' and caregivers' beliefs, attitudes and preferences regarding dialysis education and decision-making with regards to dialysis options; to identify key attributes which influence their decision-making, and to quantify the relative value of these attributes. Methods and analysis: This study will use a mixed-methods approach to describe patient and caregiver preferences and views about the factors that influence their choice of home or facility-based dialysis. Face-to-face, semistructured interviews will be conducted with 30-40 patients and 10-15 caregivers. Thematic analysis of interview transcripts will be conducted. Additional to providing information on the perspectives and experiences of patients and caregivers, these analyses will also inform the design of discrete choice experiments (DCEs). We will undertake DCEs with approximately 150 patients and 150 caregivers to quantify preferences for home and facility dialysis. Ethics and dissemination: The Hawke's Bay, Counties Manukau, and Capital Coast District Health Board Research Ethics Committees approved the study. Findings will be presented in national/international conferences and peer-reviewed journals. Dissemination to patients will take the form of presentations, newsletters and reports to support and community groups. Reports will be disseminated to funders and participating renal units and to the New Zealand Ministry of Health. ? 2015, BMJ Publishing Group.

Caffeine is a common additive to SSB, and through dependence effects, it has the potential to promote the consumption of caffeine-containing foods. The objective of the present study was to assess the influence that caffeine has on the consumption of SSB. Participants (n 99) were blindly assigned to either a caffeinated SSB (C-SSB) or a non-caffeinated SSB (NC-SSB) group. Following randomisation, all participants completed a 9 d flavour-conditioning paradigm. They then completed a 28 d ad libitum intake intervention where they consumed as much or as little of C-SSB or NC-SSB as desired. The amount consumed (ml) was recorded daily, 4 d diet diaries were collected and liking of SSB was assessed at the start and end of the intervention. Participants (n 50) consuming the C-SSB had a daily SSB intake of 419 (SD 298) ml (785 (SD 559) kJ/d) over the 28 d intervention, significantly more than participants (n 49) consuming the NC-SSB (273 (SD 278) ml/d, 512 (SD 521) kJ/d) (P<0.001). A trained flavour panel (n 30) found no difference in flavour between the C-SSB and NC-SSB (P>0.05). However, participants who consumed the C-SSB liked the SSB more than those who consumed the NC-SSB (6.3 v. 6.0 on a nine-point hedonic scale, P-0.022). The addition of low concentrations of caffeine to the SSB significantly increases the consumption of the SSB. Regulating caffeine as a food additive may be an effective strategy to decrease the consumption of nutrient-poor high-energy foods and beverages. ? 2015 The Authors.",Caffeine; Free-living populations; Sugar-sweetened beverages,caffeine; sugar; sweetening agent; caffeine; central stimulant agent; food additive; nutritive sweetener; adult; Article; beverage; concentration (parameters); controlled study; female; food analysis; food composition; food intake; food preference; human; intervention study; male; population research; rating scale; sugar sweetened beverage; young adult; adolescent; adverse effects; analysis; carbonated beverage; double blind procedure; food preference; medical record; nutrition policy; obesity; Overweight; randomized controlled trial; Victoria; Adolescent; Adult; Caffeine; Carbonated Beverages; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Diet Records; Double-Blind Method; Female; Food Additives; Food Preferences; Humans; Male; Nutrition Policy; Nutritive Sweeteners; Obesity; Overweight; Victoria; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84927571667

We examined the relationship between maternal PUFA status and risk of allergic diseases in early childhood in an Asian cohort. Maternal plasma samples from the Growing Up in Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes mother-offspring cohort were assayed at 26-28 weeks of gestation for relative abundance of PUFA. Offspring (n 960) were followed up from 3 weeks to 18 months of age, and clinical outcomes of potential allergic diseases (rhinitis, eczema and wheezing) were assessed by repeated questionnaires. Skin prick testing (SPT) was also performed at the age of 18 months. Any allergic disease with positive SPT was defined as having any one of the clinical outcomes plus a positive SPT. The prevalence of a positive SPT, rhinitis, eczema, wheezing and any allergic disease with positive SPT was 14·1 % (103/728), 26·5 % (214/808), 17·6 % (147/833), 10·9 % (94/859) and 9·4 % (62/657), respectively. After adjustment for confounders, maternal total n-3, n-6 PUFA status and the n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio were not significantly associated with offspring rhinitis, eczema, wheezing, a positive SPT and having any allergic disease with positive SPT in the offspring (P>0·01 for all). A weak trend of higher maternal n-3 PUFA being associated with higher risk of allergic diseases with positive SPT in offspring was observed. These findings do not support the hypothesis that the risk of early childhood allergic diseases is modified by variation in maternal n-3 and n-6 PUFA status during pregnancy in an Asian population.

Here, we examined maternal plasma concentrations of n-3 and n-6 PUFAs between the 26th and the 28th week of gestation in relation to blood pressures and pregnancy-associated hypertension. We used data from a birth cohort study of 751 Chinese, Malay, and Indian women. Maternal peripheral systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were taken from the brachial arm, and central SBP and pulse pressures (PPs) were derived from radial artery pressure waveforms between the 26th and the 28th week of gestation. Pregnancy-associated hypertension (including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) was ascertained from medical records. Plasma phosphatidylcholine n-3 and n-6 PUFAs were measured by gas chromatography and expressed as percentage of total fatty acids. Peripheral SBP was inversely associated with total n-3 PUFAs [-0.51 (95% confidence interval, CI,-0.89 to-0.13) mm Hg] and long-chain n-3 PUFAs [-0.52 (CI-0.92 to-0.13) mmHg]. Similar but weaker associations were observed for central SBP and PP. Dihomo-γ-linolenic acid was marginally positively associated with peripheral SBP, central SBP, and PP, whereas linoleic acid and total n-6 PUFAs showed no significant associations with blood pressures. We identified 28 pregnancy-associated hypertension cases, and 1% increase in total n-3 PUFAs was associated with a 24% lower odds of pregnancy-associated hypertension (odds ratio 0.76; 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97). Maternal ethnicity modified the PUFAs-blood pressure relations, with stronger inverse associations with n-3 PUFAs in Chinese women, and stronger positive associations with n-6 PUFAs in Indian women (P values for interaction ranged from 0.02 to 0.07). Higher n-3 PUFAs at midgestation are related to lower maternal blood pressures and pregnancy-associated hypertension in Asian women, and the ethnicity-related variation between PUFAs and blood pressures deserves further investigation.

Methods: The resting EEG spectrum of beta (14.5-30. Hz), alpha (8-13. Hz), theta (4-7.5. Hz) and delta (1.5-3.5. Hz) rhythm were measured in 32 patients undertaking chronic MMT, 17 opiate users and 25 healthy volunteers. Differences in the EEG components of each group were evaluated using a repeated measures Analyses of Variance (ANOVA). Post-hoc comparisons were Bonferroni corrected. Results: Our results show that either patients undertaking MMT or active opiate users exhibited a significant increase in the power of beta and theta bands relative to healthy control subjects. However, the spectral power of patients undertaking MMT fell between that of current opiate users and healthy control subjects on many regional EEG measures. There was an inverse correlation between the power of beta or theta bands and cognitive performance. Conclusion: The abnormal neural electrical activity present in those still using illicit opiates might be reduced following MMT. Significance: The present findings provide further support for MMT of opiate dependence and demonstrates potentially positive effects of substitution treatment on brain function. ? 2014 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.",Methadone; Opiate dependence; Resting EEG,illicit drug; methadone; opiate; methadone; adult; Article; attention; beta rhythm; brain electrophysiology; brain function; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; delta rhythm; electric activity; electroencephalogram; executive function; female; frontal lobe; heart rate; human; maintenance therapy; male; mental performance; methadone treatment; neuropsychological test; opiate addiction; post hoc analysis; priority journal; theta rhythm; clinical trial; drug effects; electroencephalogram; electroencephalography; epidemiology; membrane potential; middle aged; opiate substitution treatment; Opioid-Related Disorders; pathophysiology; Adult; Brain Waves; Controlled Before-After Studies; Electroencephalography; Female; Humans; Male; Membrane Potentials; Methadone; Middle Aged; Opiate Substitution Treatment; Opioid-Related Disorders,2-s2.0-84926167259

We aimed to investigate pharmacokinetic interactions between acetaminophen and phenylephrine. Methods: A series of four randomised, open-label, crossover studies investigating phenylephrine and acetaminophen combination pharmacokinetics were undertaken (n?=?28, 30, 6 and 26) using standard non-compartmental analyses. Time-concentration observations from these four studies were pooled to examine the interaction between these two compounds. Data were analysed using non-linear mixed effects models. Results: Non-compartmental analyses showed an approximate doubling of phenylephrine plasma concentration when the standard 10-mg dose was administered in combination with acetaminophen. Population analysis was based on data from 90 subjects with 2050 observations. The relative bioavailability of phenylephrine 10 mg was doubled (Fbio 2.11, 95%CI 1.89, 2.31) when combined with acetaminophen 1000 mg, while the absorption half-time was reduced by 50 %. When combined with 500 mg of acetaminophen, bioavailability increased by 64 % (Fbio 1.64). Phenylephrine 5 mg in combination with acetaminophen 1000 mg produced a phenylephrine plasma time-concentration profile similar to that seen with phenylephrine 10 mg administered alone. Conclusions: The relative bioavailability of phenylephrine was increased when co-administered with acetaminophen. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Acetaminophen; Interaction; Pharmacokinetics; Phenylephrine,"paracetamol; phenylephrine; aryl sulfotransferase; drug combination; ibuprofen; paracetamol; phenylephrine; SULT1A1 protein, human; adult; allele; allometry; area under the curve; Article; controlled study; crossover procedure; drug bioavailability; drug blood level; drug half life; drug safety; genotype; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human experiment; male; maximum plasma concentration; normal human; open study; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; time to maximum plasma concentration; bioavailability; biological model; blood; drug combination; drug interaction; genetics; oral drug administration; young adult; Acetaminophen; Administration, Oral; Adult; Alleles; Arylsulfotransferase; Biological Availability; Cross-Over Studies; Drug Combinations; Drug Interactions; Genotype; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Ibuprofen; Male; Models, Biological; Phenylephrine; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84925511504

This study investigated the prevalence of comorbid use of marijuana, tobacco and binge drinking among 14 to 15-year-olds. The study also examined the relationship between comorbid substance use and behaviour frequency and explored common underlying risk factors for comorbid substance use. Methods: A nationally representative sample of 3,017 New Zealand Year 10 students completed self-report measures of marijuana use, tobacco use, binge drinking and socio-demographic characteristics in the 2012 Youth Insights Survey (YIS). Weighted population estimates were calculated. Ordinal logistic regression models were constructed to a) investigate the relationship between comorbidity and substance use behaviour frequency, and b) profile those with the greatest degree of comorbid substance use. Results: In the past month, one-in-twenty (4.7%) students had engaged in all three substance use behaviours, 5.8% in two, and 11.9% in one. Around half of adolescents who had engaged in one had also engaged in another, with three-quarters of tobacco-users also using marijuana and/or binge drinking. Respondents who reported a greater degree of comorbidity were likely to engage in substance use behaviour more frequently. Comorbid substance use was significantly predicted by gender, ethnicity, school decile status, past week income, social connectedness, and parental monitoring and rule enforcement. Conclusions: The results identify a core group of adolescents sharing common characteristics who frequently engage in comorbid substance use behaviours. More sophisticated and wider interventions addressing multiple substances are required, especially for marijuana and tobacco use. ? 2015 White et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Adolescence; Alcohol; Comorbid substance use; Marijuana; Tobacco; Youth,adolescent; cannabis smoking; comorbidity; drinking behavior; female; human; male; New Zealand; prevalence; risk factor; school; self report; statistical model; student; Substance-Related Disorders; tobacco; Adolescent; Alcohol Drinking; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Marijuana Smoking; New Zealand; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Schools; Self Report; Students; Substance-Related Disorders; Tobacco,2-s2.0-84925399914

In these patients, the need for revascularization of the common hepatic artery (CHA) can be avoided on the basis of the pressure change in the CHA after clamping of the CA. Methods All patients presenting to North Shore Hospital Campus of University of Sydney with advanced pancreatic malignancy of the neck and body between 2007 and 2014 were included in the study. The pressure in the CHA was measured pre- and postclamping of the CA; a decrease of more than 25% in the mean arterial pressure necessitated vascular reconstruction of the CHA. Results Seven patients underwent a DPS-CAR between 2007 and 2014. Arterial reconstruction was required in 2 patients based on a decrease of >25% mean arterial pressure in the CHA after clamping the CA. There was no in hospital or 90-day mortality, and no patients developed ischemic hepatitis.

They are administered intravenously, thus accidental extravasations of infusions can occur. This may cause severe complications for the patient as the toxic platinum compounds likely persist in subcutaneous tissue. At high concentrations, platinum toxicity in combination with local thrombosis may result in tissue necrosis, eventually requiring surgical intervention. To describe tissue distribution at the anatomic level, we quantified drug extravasation in cryosections of various tissues (muscle, nerve tissue, connective tissue, fat tissue) by means of quantitative laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) and compared the resulting data with bulk analysis of microwave-assisted digestion of tissue samples followed by ICP-MS analysis. Samples of three patients receiving systemic chemotherapy either via peripheral venous access or central access via port-a-cath? were analyzed. Pt was enriched up to 50-times in connective tissue when compared with muscle tissue or drain samples collected over five days. The large areas of subcutaneous fat tissue showed areactive necrosis and average Pt concentrations (determined upon sample digestion) ranged from 0.2 μg g-1 (therapy with 25 mg m-2 cisplatin, four weeks after peripheral extravasation) to 10 μg g-1 (therapy with 50 mg m-2 oxaliplatin: four weeks after port-a-cath? extravasation). A peripheral nerve subjected to bioimaging by LA-ICP-MS showed a 5-times lower Pt concentration (0.2 μg g-1) than the surrounding connective tissue (1.0 μg g-1). This is in accordance with the patient showing no signs of neurotoxicity during recovery from extravasation side-effects. Thus, bioimaging of cutaneous nerve tissue may contribute to understand the risk of peripheral neurotoxic events. ? 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Ablation; Chemotherapy; Collagen; Diseases; Drug interactions; Inductively coupled plasma; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Laser ablation; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Muscle; Musculoskeletal system; Patient rehabilitation; Platinum; Platinum compounds; Spectrometry; Toxicity; Connective tissues; Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometries (LA ICP MS); Microwave assisted digestion; Peripheral nerves; Sample digestion; Subcutaneous tissues; Surgical interventions; Tissue distributions; Tissue; cisplatin; oxaliplatin; antineoplastic agent; platinum; adipose tissue; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; connective tissue; diagnostic imaging; drug extravasation; female; frozen section; human; human tissue; implantable port system; inflammation; laser surgery; liver homogenate; male; mass spectrometry; microwave radiation; muscle tissue; nerve fiber; nervous tissue; pectoralis major muscle; peripheral nerve; priority journal; subcutaneous fat; systemic therapy; tissue distribution; tissue necrosis; atomic absorption spectrometry; catheter; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; Extravasation of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Materials; kinetics; low level laser therapy; necrosis; pathology; peroperative care; procedures; reproducibility; subcutaneous tissue; Antineoplastic Agents; Catheters; Diagnostic Imaging; Extravasation of Diagnostic and Therapeutic Materials; Female; Humans; Intraoperative Care; Kinetics; Laser Therapy; Male; Necrosis; Platinum; Reproducibility of Results; Spectrophotometry, Atomic; Subcutaneous Tissue; Tissue Distribution",2-s2.0-84924993834

Little is known about women's views relating to a diagnosis of borderline gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and the subsequent management. This study aimed to explore women's experiences after being diagnosed with borderline GDM, their attitudes about treatment, and factors important to them for achieving any lifestyle changes. Methods. We conducted face-to-face, semistructured interviews with women diagnosed with borderline GDM. Results. A total of 22 women were interviewed. After a diagnosis of borderline GDM, 14 (64%) women reported not being concerned or worried. Management of borderline GDM was thought by 21 (95%) women to be very important or important. Eighteen (82%) women planned to improve their diet and/or exercise to manage their borderline GDM. The most frequently mentioned enabler for achieving intended lifestyle change was being more motivated to improve the health of their baby and/or themselves (15 women). The most frequent barrier was tiredness and/or being physically unwell (11 women). Conclusions. A diagnosis of borderline GDM caused some concern to one-third of women interviewed. The majority of women believed managing their borderline GDM was important and they planned to improve their lifestyle. Women's own and their babies' future health were powerful motivators for lifestyle change. ? 2015 Shanshan Han et al.",,"glucose; adult; Article; borderline gestational diabetes mellitus; clinical article; diet therapy; exercise; family history; fatigue; female; glucose blood level; human; information seeking; lifestyle modification; maternal obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; patient attitude; patient worry; personal experience; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); semi structured interview; attitude to health; controlled study; Diabetes, Gestational; diet; glucose intolerance; glucose tolerance test; interview; lifestyle; patient participation; pregnancy; randomized controlled trial; young adult; Adult; Attitude to Health; Diabetes, Gestational; Diet; Exercise; Fatigue; Female; Glucose Intolerance; Glucose Tolerance Test; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Life Style; Patient Participation; Pregnancy; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84924365744

Sulforaphane has been shown to inhibit PRR-mediated pro-inflammatory signalling by either directly targeting the receptor or their downstream signalling molecules such as the transcription factor, NF-κB. These results raise the possibility that PRR-mediated inflammation could be suppressed by specific dietary bioactives. We examined whether sulforaphane could suppress NF-κB via the NOD2 pathway. Methods: Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were stably transfected with NOD2 variants and the NF-κB reporter, pNifty2-SEAP. The cells were co-treated with sulforaphane and MDP and secreted alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) production was determined. Results: We found that sulforaphane was able to significantly suppress the ligand-induced NF-κB activity at physiologically relevant concentrations, achievable via the consumption of broccoli within the diet. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that the anti-inflammatory role of sulforaphane is not restricted to LPS-induced inflammatory signalling. These data add to the growing evidence that PRR activation can be inhibited by specific phytochemicals and thus suggests that diet could be a way of controlling inflammation. This is particularly important for a disease like Crohn's disease where diet can play a key role in relieving or exacerbating symptoms. ? 2015 Folkard et al.",Crohn's disease; Inflammation; Nod2; Sulforaphane,alkaline phosphatase; caspase recruitment domain protein 15; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; muramyl dipeptide; pattern recognition receptor; plant medicinal product; protein variant; secreted alkaline phosphatase; sulforaphane; unclassified drug; antiinflammatory activity; Article; broccoli; controlled study; Crohn disease; disease control; drug dosage form comparison; drug effect; drug mechanism; embryo; enzyme assay; enzyme synthesis; food intake; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; Brassica oleracea var. italica,2-s2.0-84924071321

We compared the prognostic utility of the European System for Cardiac Operative Risk Evaluation (EuroSCORE), EuroSCORE II, Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) score, and an Australasian model (Aus-AVR score) for AVR. Methods We retrospectively calculated the 4 risk scores for patients undergoing isolated AVR at Auckland City Hospital from 2005 to 2012 and assessed their discrimination and calibration for short- and long-term mortality. Results A total of 620 patients were followed up for 3.8 ± 2.4 years, with an operative mortality of 2.9% (n = 18). The mean EuroSCORE, EuroSCORE II, STS score, and Aus-AVR score was 8.7% ± 8.3%, 3.8% ± 4.7%, 2.8% ± 2.7%, and 3.2% ± 4.8%, respectively. The corresponding C-statistics for operative mortality were 0.752 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.652-0.852), 0.711 (95% CI, 0.607-0.815), 0.716 (95% CI, 0.593-0.837), and 0.684 (95% CI, 0.557-0.811). The corresponding Hosmer-Lemeshow test P and chi-square values for calibration were.007 and 21.1,.125 and 12.6,.753 and 5.0, and.468 and 7.7. The corresponding Brier scores were 0.0348, 0.0278, 0.0276, and 0.0294. Independent predictors of operative mortality included critical preoperative state, atrial fibrillation, extracardiac arteriopathy, and mitral stenosis. The log-rank test P values were all <.001 for mortality during follow-up for all 4 scores, stratified by quintile. Conclusions All 4 risk scores discriminated operative mortality after isolated AVR. The EuroSCORE had poor calibration, overestimating operative mortality, although the other 3 scores fitted well with contemporary outcomes.

In 2008 the University of Auckland medical programme introduced a Year 5 regional and rural immersion programme, P?kawakawa, based in Northland, New Zealand (NZ). This study evaluates the early workforce outcomes of graduates of this programme. Methods: During 2013 we surveyed Auckland medical graduates who were in the 2008–2011 P?kawakawa cohorts. Questions were asked regarding recent and current place of work, future intentions for place of work, and career preference with reasons why. Qualitative analysis was undertaken to analyse free text responses about experiences of P?kawakawa on this choice. Results: Of the 72 P?kawakawa participants, 45 completed the survey, for a response rate of 63%. In 2013, 62% were working in rural or regional areas, with 31% in the Northland DHB. The great majority intend to work rurally or regionally, with 35.6% intending to return to Northland DHB. Of the respondents, 68% listed general practice in their top three future career intentions. Conclusions: In the early postgraduate years, medical graduates who participated in P?kawakawa are very likely to be working in rural and regional areas. These graduates also show an intention to work in general practice and rural medicine. ?

Aim: We aimed to gain an understanding of smokefree rules around Australian and New Zealand (NZ) Indigenous infants. Method: This was a qualitative study nested within a randomised controlled trial that aimed to test the efficacy of a family-centred tobacco control programme about environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) to improve the respiratory health of Indigenous infants in Australia and New Zealand. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were conducted with 26 Indigenous mothers of infants in Australia (. n=. 7) and NZ (. n=. 19). We asked about the presence of smokefree rules, who set the rules, how the rules were set and enforced, and presence of smokefree rules in participants' wider social circle. Interviews were audiotaped, transcribed, and inductively analysed to identify key themes. Findings: Sixty-nine percent of mothers had partners, 77% smoked and all reported some presence of smokefree rules for house and car. Three main themes were identified: strategies to minimise exposure to ETS, establishing smokefree rules in homes and cars, and, adherence and enforcement of smokefree rules. Several strategies were identified to limit children's exposure to ETS, including rules to limit exposure to third-hand smoke. Mothers extended their smokefree rules to apply to other people's houses or cars, and reported that their family and social circles also had smokefree rules. The main reason for having smokefree rules was for the health of their children. Rules were most commonly set by the mother, often jointly with their partner. Few mothers reported challenges or problems with other people adhering to the smokefree rules. Conclusion: Women tried very hard to, and believed that they were effective in, protecting their children from the harmful effects of ETS exposure. In this context, health professionals need to emphasise smoking cessation in parents, so that children are maximally protected from ETS exposure. ? 2014 Australian College of Midwives.",Children; Environmental tobacco smoke rules; Indigenous; Qualitative interviews,"adult; Article; Australian; child; child health; controlled study; environmental exposure; family centered care; female; home environment; human; indigenous people; maternal attitude; New Zealand; passive smoking; prevalence; priority journal; qualitative research; randomized controlled trial; semi structured interview; smoking ban; attitude to health; Australia; family; infant; mother; Oceanic ancestry group; prevention and control; procedures; smoking; smoking cessation; passive smoking; Adult; Australia; Child; Environmental Exposure; Family; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infant; Mothers; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",2-s2.0-84923371928

Methods: All women who delivered at Counties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB) for a 12-month period from July 2012 to June 2013 had demographic, pregnancy and laboratory data obtained from hospital databases and clinical records. Results: Of the 6376 (85%) of eligible women screened for GDM, 381 (6%) had GDM by NZSSD criteria and an additional 238 (4%) by the modified IADPSG-additional criteria, a relative increase of 62%. Women with GDM by NZSSD criteria had similar characteristics compared to women with GDM by IADPSG-additional. The outcomes between the two groups were also similar with the exception of a higher induction of labour (IOL) rate in women with GDM by NZSSD and a higher mean birthweight in the GDM by IADPSG-additional. Conclusion: Adopting the modified IADPSG criteria will result in a 62% increase in the number of GDM cases with a significant impact on workload and resources.

The central cause of gout is deposition of monosodium urate crystals, and the focus of treatment is aimed at crystal dissolution using urate-lowering therapy.Areas covered: The review describes the current treatments for urate-lowering therapy including allopurinol, febuxostat, probenecid, benzbromarone and pegloticase. Anti-inflammatory treatment of acute flares and prophylaxis of flares with NSAIDs, colchicine, corticosteroids and anti-IL-1 agents is also reviewed. In addition, drugs in Phase III clinical trials for gout indications are reviewed.Expert opinion: In the last decade, there has been major progress in the pharmacotherapy of gout. Management guidelines have emphasized the importance of a therapeutic serum urate target for effective gout management. Studies have identified the safe and effective dosing strategies for 'old' drugs such as allopurinol and colchicine. New therapeutic agents have been developed and approved for both urate-lowering therapy and anti-inflammatory treatment of acute flares. However, quality of care remains a major challenge in gout management, and strategies to ensure best practice require further focus to ensure that the progress of the last decade translates into clinical benefit for people with gout. ? 2015 Informa UK, Ltd.",Allopurinol; Febuxostat; Gout; Pegloticase; Probenecid; Urate,"allopurinol; benzbromarone; colchicine; corticosteroid; febuxostat; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; pegloticase; probenecid; urate oxidase; uricosuric agent; xanthine oxidase inhibitor; allopurinol; antigout agent; canakinumab; febuxostat; macrogol derivative; monoclonal antibody; pegloticase; thiazole derivative; urate oxidase; uric acid; disease exacerbation; drug dose titration; drug effect; drug indication; drug research; gout; human; Review; gout; metabolism; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Allopurinol; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Benzbromarone; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Colchicine; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Polyethylene Glycols; Probenecid; Thiazoles; Urate Oxidase; Uric Acid",2-s2.0-84922932046

Aims This article describes the methodology of the stroke self-management rehabilitation trial. The overall aim of this pilot trial is to assess the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of a DVD-based intervention for improving functional outcomes of survivors of stroke 2 months postrandomization to inform the design of a full-scale randomized clinical trial. Design Recruitment of a minimum of 20 survivors of stroke and their informal caregivers (where available) in each of the participating centers will occur across multiple international sites. After baseline assessments, participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention or standard care group. The intervention comprises a structured DVD observation and practice schedule over 8 weeks. All participants will complete follow-up assessments. Study outcomes The outcome measures will include a global shift in the Rankin Scale scores and dichotomized scores, changes in quality of life, general health, depression, and caregiver burden at 2 months postrandomization. A qualitative analysis of the effects of the intervention will also be undertaken. Discussion The results of the pilot study will provide knowledge of whether observational learning techniques delivered via DVD can effectively improve recovery after stroke and reduce caregiver burden. ? 2015 National Stroke Association.",clinical trials; methodology; protocols; rehabilitation; Stroke; treatment,aged; Article; caregiver; caregiver burden; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; clinical trial; depression; feasibility study; follow up; functional assessment; human; learning; multicenter study; observation; pilot study; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quality of life; randomization; Rankin scale; rehabilitation care; self care; survivor; clinical protocol; controlled study; methodology; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; Stroke; Caregivers; Clinical Protocols; Humans; Pilot Projects; Quality of Life; Research Design; Self Care; Stroke,2-s2.0-84922848811

One issue that remains unresolved is why some respond to placebos and others do not. A number of traits have been linked to responding, but findings are scattered. In extending prior work, this paper offers three considerations. First, attempts to describe the placebo responder via a single personality trait may be limiting. A synthesis of findings to date suggests placebo responsiveness may reflect a two-faceted construct, with ""inward"" and ""outward"" orientation representing the different but related facets of placebo responsiveness. Second, the lack of theoretically driven research may be hindering progress. Personality measures rather than personality theory appear to be driving research and higher order traits are descriptive tools with limited use in predicting behaviour. A biologically based stimulus-response model of personality that considers how individuals respond to certain environmental cues may be more appropriate. Third, a transactional model of placebo responding in which dispositional characteristics interact with environmental contingencies is presented. Responsiveness may manifest in placebo environments where there is a match between an individuals biological trait-like response systems and environmental contingencies. This type of model may be useful in both research and clinical settings. Systematic consideration of how different individuals might respond to different placebo environments might facilitate identification of stable individual characteristics predictive of responding. The ability to determine who is responsive to placebo treatments, and in what context, may enable the matching of individual to treatment, thereby maximising the effectiveness of treatment and minimising possible iatrogenic harm. In the increasingly overtaxed modern health care industry, non-pharmacological treatment alternatives are of critical importance. ? 2014 Taylor & Francis.",personality; placebo effect; placebo responder; transactional model,"human; personality; physiology; placebo effect; psychological model; Humans; Models, Psychological; Personality; Placebo Effect",2-s2.0-84922642282

A single-blind randomized trial was undertaken to determine the efficacy of a family centered SHS intervention to reduce ARI in indigenous infants in Australia and New Zealand. Methods: Indigenous mothers/infants from homes with ?1 smoker were randomized to a SHS intervention involving 3 home visits in the first 3 months of the infants' lives (plus usual care) or usual care. The primary outcome was number of ARI-related visits to a health provider in the first year of life. Secondary outcomes, assessed at 4 and 12 months of age, included ARI hospitalization rates and mothers' report of infants' SHS exposure (validated by urinary cotinine/creatinine ratios [CCRs]), smoking restrictions, and smoking cessation. Results: Two hundred and ninety-three mother/infant dyads were randomized and followed up. Three quarters of mothers smoked during pregnancy and two thirds were smoking at baseline (as were their partners), with no change for more than 12 months. Reported infant exposure to SHS was low (?95% had smoke-free homes/cars). Infant CCRs were higher if one or both parents were smokers and if mothers breast fed their infants. There was no effect of the intervention on ARI events [471 intervention vs. 438 usual care (reference); incidence rate ratio = 1.10, 95% confidence intervals (CI) = 0.88-1.37, p = .40]. Conclusions: Despite reporting smoke-free homes/cars, mothers and their partners continue to smoke in the first year of infants' lives, exposing them to SHS. Emphasis needs to be placed on supporting parents to stop smoking preconception, during pregnancy, and postnatal. ?

Covert and overt instances of homophobia are evident within residential care services provided to older lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Aims: To explore the perceptions of care staff working in residential care homes towards older lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Design: Critical gerontology formed the methodological foundations for focus group discussions with care staff from seven residential care facilities. Hypothetical vignettes were used to stimulate discussion amongst participants. Results: Thematic analysis of the seven focus group interviews illuminated three themes: 'Knowing me knowing you', 'Out of sight out of mind' and 'It's a generational thing'. Subtle as well as not so subtle forms of homophobia were evident in each of the themes. Care staff felt they were largely unprepared to provide care to older lesbian, gay and bisexual people. Conclusion: This small-scale New Zealand study identifies that the residential care sector is not always supportive, or prepared, to provide a care service to those people identifying as lesbian, gay and bisexual.

The International Network for Food and Obesity/non-communicable diseases (NCDs) Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) has developed a monitoring tool (the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI)) and process to rate government policies to create healthy food environments against international best practice. The aims of this study were to pilot test the Food-EPI, and revise the tool and process for international implementation. Setting: New Zealand. Participants: Thirty-nine informed, independent public health experts and non-governmental organisation (NGO) representatives. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Evidence on the extent of government implementation of different policies on food environments and infrastructure support was collected in New Zealand and validated with government officials. Two whole-day workshops were convened of public health experts and NGO representatives who rated performance of their government for seven policy and seven infrastructure support domains against international best practice. In addition, the raters evaluated the level of difficulty of rating, and appropriateness and completeness of the evidence presented for each indicator. Results: Inter-rater reliability was 0.85 (95% CI 0.81 to 0.88; Gwet's AC2) using quadratic weights, and increased to 0.89 (95% CI 0.85 to 0.92) after deletion of the problematic indicators. Based on raters' assessments and comments, major changes to the Food-EPI tool include strengthening the leadership domain, removing the workforce development domain, a stronger focus on equity, and adding communitybased programmes and government funding for research on obesity and diet-related NCD prevention, as good practice indicators.

Post hoc analysis has suggested that bone turnover markers can identify patients at risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) among those receiving zoledronic acid. This study sought to evaluate the effect on bone metastases of everolimus alone compared with everolimus plus zoledronic acid. Patients and Methods Thirty treatment-naive patients with RCC and ? 1 bone metastases were randomized 1:1 to everolimus (10 mg daily) versus everolimus plus zoledronic acid (4 mg intravenously 4-weekly). Bone-specific assessments were performed at baseline and at weeks 1, 4, 8, and 12. Treatment was continued on allocated arm until progression per RECIST 1.1 (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, version 1.1). The primary outcome measure was urine N-telopeptide (uNTX) level, with secondary measures of plasma C-telopeptide (CTX), quality of life (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Bone Pain [FACT-BP], Brief Pain Inventory [BPI]), progression-free survival (PFS), SREs, and safety. Results After 12 weeks, reduction in mean uNTX and CTX on everolimus plus zoledronic acid relative to everolimus was 68.4% (95% CI, 60.1%-74.9%; P <.0001) and 76.2% (95% CI, 67.3%-82.7%; P <.0001), respectively. There was no evidence of a difference for FACT-BP (P =.5), but evidence was favorable for BPI Severity (P =.05) and BPI Interference (P =.06). Median PFS was 7.5 months (95% CI, 3.4-11.2) on everolimus plus zoledronic acid and 5.4 months (95% CI, 3.2-6.3) on everolimus (P =.009). Median time to first SRE was 9.6 months (95% CI, 4.3-15.5) on everolimus plus zoledronic acid and 5.2 months (95% CI, 1.6-8.2) on everolimus (P =.03). Conclusion In this RCC population, the addition of zoledronic acid to everolimus significantly reduced bone resorption markers and may prolong tumor control. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Bisphosphonates; Neoplasm metastasis; Randomized controlled trial; Skeletal-related events; Targeted therapy,"amino terminal telopeptide; biological marker; carboxy terminal telopeptide; everolimus; zoledronic acid; antineoplastic agent; bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; collagen type 1; collagen type I trimeric cross-linked peptide; everolimus; imidazole derivative; peptide; rapamycin; zoledronic acid; adult; aged; Article; bone metastasis; bone pain; bone turnover; Brief Pain Inventory; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer control; cancer patient; cancer staging; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; creatinine clearance; drug dose reduction; drug withdrawal; female; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bone Pain; human; hypocalcemia; jaw osteonecrosis; kidney carcinoma; male; multicenter study; osteolysis; phase 2 clinical trial; progression free survival; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; side effect; treatment outcome; analogs and derivatives; blood; Bone Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; clinical trial; Kidney Neoplasms; middle aged; prospective study; secondary; urine; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Bone Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Collagen Type I; Diphosphonates; Female; Humans; Imidazoles; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Peptides; Prospective Studies; Sirolimus; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84920558861

We detail that mice lacking Reverbα exhibit enhanced fat storage without the predicted increased WAT inflammation or loss of insulin sensitivity. In contrast to most animal models of obesity and obese human patients, Reverbα-/- mice exhibit elevated serum adiponectin levels and increased adiponectin secretion fromWAT explants in vitro, highlighting a potential anti-inflammatory role of this adipokine in hypertrophic WAT. Indeed, adiponectin was found to suppress primary macrophage responses to lipopolysaccharide and proinflammatory fatty acids, and this suppression depended on glycogen synthase kinase 3β activation and induction of A20. Attenuated inflammatory responses in Reverbα-/- WAT depots were associated with tonic elevation of A20 protein and ex vivo shown to depend on A20. We also demonstrate that adipose A20 expression in obese human subjects exhibits a negative correlation with measures of insulin sensitivity. Furthermore, bariatric surgery-induced weight loss was accompanied by enhanced WAT A20 expression, which is positively correlated with increased serum adiponectin and improved metabolic and inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein. The findings identify A20 as a mediator of adiponectin anti-inflammatory action in WAT and a potential target for mitigating obesity-related pathology. ? 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"adipocytokine; adiponectin; biological marker; C reactive protein; fatty acid; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; insulin; lipopolysaccharide; protein A20; regulator protein; unclassified drug; adiponectin; ADIPOQ protein, human; Adipoq protein, mouse; cysteine proteinase; DNA binding protein; glycogen synthase kinase 3; glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta; nuclear protein; signal peptide; small interfering RNA; TNFAIP3 protein, human; Tnfaip3 protein, mouse; adipose tissue; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bariatric surgery; controlled study; enzyme activation; ex vivo study; human; human tissue; inflammation; insulin sensitivity; lipid storage; macrophage; male; metabolism; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; protein induction; weight reduction; animal; cell culture; cytology; energy metabolism; female; gene expression; genetics; immunology; insulin resistance; knockout mouse; lipid diet; panniculitis; physiology; white adipose tissue; Adiponectin; Adipose Tissue, White; Animals; Cells, Cultured; Cysteine Endopeptidases; Diet, High-Fat; DNA-Binding Proteins; Energy Metabolism; Female; Gene Expression; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Macrophages; Male; Mice, Knockout; Nuclear Proteins; Obesity; Panniculitis; RNA, Small Interfering",2-s2.0-84920025693

This study investigated the importance of fetal genotype (db/+) relative to abnormal maternal metabolism for placental function and therefore fetal growth and offspring health. Wild-type (WT) and db/+females were mated to db/+ and WT males, respectively, generating litters of mixed genotype. Placentas and fetuses were weighed at embryonic day 18.5; offspring weight, hormone levels, glucose tolerance, and blood pressure were assessed at 3 and 6 months. Pregnant db/+, but not WT, dams had impaired glucose tolerance. The db/+ placentas and fetuses were heavier than WT, but the maternal environment had no effect; WT placentas/fetuses from db/+ mothers were no bigger than WT placentas/ fetuses carried by WT mothers. Postnatal weight gain, glucose metabolism, and leptin levels were all influenced by offspring genotype. However, maternal environment affected aspects of offspring health because WT male offspring born to db/+dams were heavier and had worse glucose tolerance than the sex-matched WT offspring of WT mothers. Blood pressure was not affected by maternal or offspring genotype. These data reveal that studies using the db/+mouse to model outcomes of pregnancy complicated by gestational diabetes should be mindful of the genetically predisposed fetal/postnatal overgrowth. Although inappropriate for dissecting the effect of maternal hyperglycemia on the contribution of placental function to macrosomia, the db/+ mouse may prove useful for investigating mechanisms underlying programming of suboptimal postnatal weight gain and glucose metabolism by an adverse maternal metabolic environment. ? 2015 by the Endocrine Society.",,"leptin; leptin receptor; leptin receptor; leptin receptor, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; blood pressure; controlled study; environmental exposure; female; fetus; fetus growth; genotype; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance; hyperglycemia; male; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; perinatal period; placenta development; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; progeny; weight gain; animal; fetus development; genetics; glucose intolerance; growth, development and aging; metabolism; placenta; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; weight gain; Animals; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Fetal Development; Genotype; Glucose Intolerance; Male; Mice; Placenta; Pregnancy; Receptors, Leptin; Weight Gain",2-s2.0-84919756189

This add-on margin or 'addiction surplus' provides a powerful incentive for beneficiaries to protect their income by ensuring addicted consumers keep consuming.

This paper examines the potency of addiction surplus to engage industry, governments and communities in an on-going reliance on addiction surplus. It then explores how neo-liberal constructions of a rational consumer disguise the ethical and exploitative dynamics of addiction surplus by examining ways in which addictive consumptions fail to conform to notions of autonomy and rationality.

Increasingly, couples are turning to assisted reproductive technology (ART) for help with conceiving and ultimately giving birth to a healthy live baby of their own. Fertility treatments are complex, and each ART cycle consists of several steps. If one of the steps is incorrectly applied, the stakes are high as conception may not occur. With this in mind, it is important that each step of the ART cycle is supported by good evidence from well-designed studies. Objectives: To summarise the evidence from Cochrane systematic reviews on procedures and treatment options available to couples with subfertility undergoing assisted reproductive technology (ART). Methods: Published Cochrane systematic reviews of couples undergoing ART (in vitro fertilisation or intracytoplasmic sperm injection) were eligible for inclusion in the overview. We also identified Cochrane reviews in preparation, for future inclusion. The outcomes of the overview were live birth (primary outcome), clinical pregnancy, multiple pregnancy, miscarriage and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (secondary outcomes). Studies of intrauterine insemination and ovulation induction were excluded. Selection of systematic reviews, data extraction and quality assessment were undertaken in duplicate. Review quality was assessed by using the AMSTAR tool. Reviews were organised by their relevance to specific stages in the ART cycle. Their findings were summarised in the text and data for each outcome were reported in 'Additional tables'. Main results: Fifty-eight systematic reviews published in The Cochrane Library were included. All were high quality. Thirty-two reviews identified interventions that were effective (n = 19) or promising (n = 13), 14 reviews identified interventions that were either ineffective (n = 3) or possibly ineffective (n=11), and 12 reviews were unable to draw conclusions due to lack of evidence. An additional 11 protocols and one title were identified for future inclusion in this overview. Authors' conclusions: This overview provides the most up to date evidence on ART cycles from systematic reviews of randomised controlled trials. Fertility treatments are costly and the stakes are high. Using the best available evidence to optimise outcomes is best practice. The evidence from this overview could be used to develop clinical practice guidelines and protocols for use in daily clinical practice, in order to improve live birth rates and reduce rates of multiple pregnancy, cycle cancellation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. ? 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,antioxidant; clomifene citrate; follitropin; gonadorelin; growth hormone; oral contraceptive agent; acupuncture; conception; embryo; embryo transfer; endometriosis; female; human; in vitro fertilization; infertility therapy; intracytoplasmic sperm injection; intrauterine insemination; multiple pregnancy; oocyte retrieval; ovary cyst; ovary hyperstimulation; ovary polycystic disease; ovulation induction; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; sexual intercourse; sperm retrieval; subfertility; systematic review; vitrification,2-s2.0-84925225287

However, in most studies neuroimaging was done after a significant postnatal period, and in those studies that performed neuroimaging on fetuses, the quality of data has been affected due to complications of scanning during pregnancy. To understand healthy brain development between 37-41 weeks of gestational age, our study assessed the in utero growth of the brain in healthy term born babies with DTI scanning soon after birth. Copyright:Methods: A cohort of 93 infants recruited from maternity hospitals in Singapore underwent diffusion tensor imaging between 5 to 17 days after birth. We did a cross-sectional examination of white matter microstructure of the brain among healthy term infants as a function of gestational age via voxel-based analysis on fractional anisotropy.Results: Greater gestational age at birth in term infants was associated with larger fractional anisotropy values in early developing brain regions, when corrected for age at scan. Specifically, it was associated with a cluster located at the corpus callosum (corrected p<0.001), as well as another cluster spanning areas of the anterior corona radiata, anterior limb of internal capsule, and external capsule (corrected p<0.001).Conclusions: Our findings show variation in brain maturation associated with gestational age amongst 'term' infants, with increased brain maturation when born with a relatively higher gestational age in comparison to those infants born with a relatively younger gestational age. Future studies should explore if these differences in brain maturation between 37 and 41 weeks of gestational age will persist over time due to development outside the womb. ? 2014 Broekman et al.",,"Article; brain development; brain maturation; brain region; capsula interna; cohort analysis; controlled study; corona radiata (brain); corpus callosum; diffusion tensor imaging; external capsule; female; fractional anisotropy; gestational age; human; male; neuroanatomy; newborn; normal human; Singapore; anatomy and histology; anisotropy; brain; demography; growth, development and aging; pregnancy; term birth; Radiata; Anisotropy; Brain; Cohort Studies; Demography; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pregnancy; Term Birth",2-s2.0-84919815903

While there are risks and benefits for both elective repeat caesarean birth and planned induction of labour, current sources of information are limited to non-randomised cohort studies. Studies designed in this way have significant potential for bias and consequently any conclusions based on these results are limited in their reliability and should be interpreted with caution. Objectives: To assess, using the best available evidence, the benefits and harms of elective repeat caesarean section and planned induction of labour for women with a previous caesarean birth, who require induction of labour in a subsequent pregnancy. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group Trials Register (31 October 2014). Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials with reported data that compared outcomes in mothers and babies for women who planned an elective repeat caesarean section with outcomes in women who planned induction of labour, where a previous birth had been by caesarean. Data collection and analysis: There was no data extraction performed. Main results: There were no randomised controlled trials identified. Authors' conclusions: Both planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned induction of labour for women with a prior caesarean birth are associated with benefits and harms. Evidence for these care practices is drawn from non-randomised studies that are associated with potential bias. Any results and conclusions must therefore be interpreted with caution. Randomised controlled trials are required to provide the most reliable evidence regarding the benefits and harms of both planned elective repeat caesarean section and planned induction of labour for women with a previous caesarean birth. ? 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"child death; evidence based practice; female; health care cost; human; infant disease; intermethod comparison; labor induction; maternal death; maternal morbidity; newborn morbidity; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); repeat cesarean section; Review; risk benefit analysis; cesarean section; delivery; elective surgery; pregnancy; Cesarean Section, Repeat; Elective Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Labor, Induced; Pregnancy; Vaginal Birth after Cesarean",2-s2.0-84925226114

Methods: Data from 27,840 adult (18+ years) participants, hospitalised for injury, were extracted for analysis from the Validating and Improving injury Burden Estimates (Injury-VIBES) Study. Modified Poisson and linear regression analyses were used to estimate relative risks and mean differences, respectively, for a range of outcomes (Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended, GOS-E; EQ-5D and 12-item Short Form health survey physical and mental component summary scores, PCS-12 and MCS-12) according to the number of injuries sustained, adjusted for age, sex and contributing study. Findings: More than half (54%) of patients had an injury to more than one ICD-10 body region and 62% had sustained more than one Global Burden of Disease injury type. The adjusted relative risk of a poor functional recovery (GOS-E<7) and of reporting problems on each of the items of the EQ-5D increased by 5-10% for each additional injury type, or body region, injured. Adjusted mean PCS-12 and MCS-12 scores worsened with each additional injury type, or body region, injured by 1.3-1.5 points and 0.5 points, respectively. Conclusions: Consistent and strong relationships exist between the number of injury types and body regions injured and 12-month functional and health status outcomes. Existing composite measures of anatomical injury severity such as the NISS or ISS, which use up to three diagnoses only, may be insufficient for characterising or accounting for multiple injuries in disability studies. Future studies should consider the impact of multiple injuries to avoid under-estimation of injury burden. ? 2014 Gabbe et al.",,adult; Article; body regions; controlled study; diagnostic procedure; disability; EQ-5D; female; Glasgow outcome scale; Global Burden of Disease study; GOS-E; health status; human; ICD-10; injury scale; injury severity; male; MCS-12; mental component summary score; multiple trauma; New Injury Severity Score; outcome assessment; PCS-12; risk factor; Short Form 12; Validating and Improving injury Burden Estimates Study; convalescence; disabled person; health survey; hospitalization; middle aged; pathophysiology; statistics and numerical data; Wounds and Injuries; Disability Evaluation; Disabled Persons; Female; Health Surveys; Hospitalization; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Male; Middle Aged; Recovery of Function; Wounds and Injuries,2-s2.0-84917710587

HBOT is vulnerable to use in many such conditions for various reasons, perhaps the most important being that a placebo or participation effect may create an impression of efficacy. The systematic use of HBOT in unestablished indications raises ethical concerns about provision of misleading information, giving false hope, and taking payment for therapy of doubtful benefit. Any practice perceived as unethical or unscientific has the potential to draw the wider field into disrepute. Of substantial contemporary relevance is the use of HBOT in treatment of various forms of chronic brain injury; in particular, cerebral palsy in children and the sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury in adults. There are now multiple, randomised, blinded, sham-controlled trials of HBOT in both indications. None of these studies showed benefit of HBOT when compared to sham control, though the sham and HBOT groups often both improved, indicating that a placebo or participation effect influenced outcomes. These results almost certainly explain those of open-label trials (lacking sham controls) in which HBOT frequently seems beneficial. Advocates for HBOT in chronic brain injury claim that the sham treatments (usually 1.3 ATA* pressure exposure whilst air breathing) in the blinded trials are actually active treatments; however, the same dose of oxygen can be achieved at 1 ATA breathing 27% oxygen. To counter this argument, advocates also claim that the extra 0.3 ATA of pressure is somehow independently beneficial, but this notion has limited biological plausibility and there is little supporting evidence. Chronic brain injuries remain unestablished indications at this time and, in our opinion, should not be systematically treated with HBOT. ? 2014, South Pacific Underwater Medicine Society.

The Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) investigators have published several scores for predicting patient risk both at hospital admission and discharge. Objective: To evaluate the performance of the admission-to-6-month and discharge-to-6-month GRACE scores for predicting myocardial infarction (MI) and mortality in a contemporary cohort of patients admitted with ACS. Methods: The cohort comprised 3743 consecutive patients admitted to cardiology services in two large New Zealand hospitals with an ACS between 2007 and 2011. Risk score data was collected in an electronic registry and linked anonymously to national hospitalisation and mortality records. Results: Between admission and 6 months, 160 patients died and another 269 were rehospitalised with an MI. The GRACE admission-to-6-month total mortality and mortality/MI scores both overestimated event rates approximately twofold. The discharge-to-6-month mortality equation was better calibrated. Global discrimination was very good for both admission-to-6-month and discharge-to-6-month mortality scores (c=0.805 and c=0.795, respectively) and moderately good for the corresponding mortality/MI equations (c=0.652 and c=0.624, respectively). Conclusions: In a contemporary ACS cohort, the GRACE discharge-to-6-month mortality score has very good discrimination and accurately predicts mortality rates, whereas the admission-to-6-month equation, despite good discrimination, overestimated risk. Recalibration or more dynamic modelling of inhospital risk which includes variables such as time from admission to risk assessment are needed to support use of ACS risk assessment inhospital. ? 2014, BMJ Publishing Group.

GAS pili are hair-like extensions protruding from the cell surface and consist of highly immunogenic structural proteins: the backbone pilin (BP) and one or two accessory pilins (AP1 and AP2). The protease-resistant BP builds the pilus shaft and has been recognized as the T-antigen, which forms the basis of a major serological typing scheme that is often used as a supplement to M typing. A previous sequence analysis of the bp gene (tee gene) in 39 GAS isolates revealed 15 different bp/tee types. In this study, we sequenced the bp/tee gene from 100 GAS isolates obtained from patients with pharyngitis, ARF or invasive disease in New Zealand. We found 20 new bp/tee alleles and four new bp/tee types/ subtypes. No association between bp/tee type and clinical outcome was observed. We confirmed earlier reports that the emm type and tee type are associated strongly, but we also found exceptions, where multiple tee types could be found in certain M/emm type strains, such as M/ emm89. We also reported, for the first time, the existence of a chimeric bp/tee allele, which was assigned into a new subclade (bp/tee3.1). A strong sequence conservation of the bp/tee gene was observed within the individual bp/tee types/subtypes (>97% sequence identity), as well as between historical and contemporary New Zealand and international GAS strains. This temporal and geographical sequence stability provided further evidence for the potential use of the BP/T-antigen as a vaccine target. ? 2014 The Authors.",,"antigen; neuropilin 1; neuropilin 2; proteinase; structural protein; vaccine; bacterial antigen; bacterial DNA; fimbria protein; Article; bacterial gene; bp tee gene; controlled study; genetic association; immunogenicity; New Zealand; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; nucleotide sequence; outcome assessment; pharyngitis; rheumatic fever; sequence analysis; Streptococcus group A; Streptococcus pyogenes; toxic shock syndrome; type strain; chemistry; classification; DNA sequence; genetic variability; genetics; human; isolation and purification; microbiology; molecular epidemiology; molecular genetics; New Zealand; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes; Antigens, Bacterial; DNA, Bacterial; Fimbriae Proteins; Genetic Variation; Humans; Molecular Epidemiology; Molecular Sequence Data; New Zealand; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes",2-s2.0-84919383769

We share the passion and drive to this aim with our colleagues Saul et al,1 who write to advocate infant screening of infants for LQTS. Although Saul et al aimed to write an unbiased review of the subject, they present data that support screening while underrepresenting evidence against it. Their illustrative Figure 1 is arguably misleading, presenting a graph of freedom from any cardiac event in symptomatic individuals with familial LQTS. We know that 87% of deaths from LQTS occur in those who were previously symptomatic.2 This discussion, however, is not about symptomatic patients with LQTS; it is about the detection of presymptomatic individuals on a community level. Our aim is to present evidence that has led us to oppose the conclusions and suggestions of their article. Most pediatric cardiologists do not wish to see ECG screening in infancy,3 and we are among them. Saul et al state that there is sufficient evidence to propose ECG screening in infancy for LQTS. We disagree. We disagree with this view for a number of reasons:(1) The effectiveness of such a program has not been evaluated in terms of outcome.(2)The ECG is an unreliable diagnostic tool with unacceptable reproducibility, specificity, and sensitivity (3)The adverse effects of overdiagnosing or underdiagnosing LQTS in thousands of individuals have not been evaluated. (4)There are no definitive criterion standard by which LQTS can be excluded once the possibility is raised, and in particular genetic testing is not sensitive or specific enough to do so. (5)There is a paucity of normative ECG and genetic data for non-Whites. We propose what we believe is a more attractive alternative: the detection of LQTS in the community through an active multidisciplinary program to detect probands and screen family members, based around a clinical registry. This has already proven to be effective.4-8 If adequately resourced, this method will provide a quicker, more reliable, and more societally acceptable method to detect and manage families at risk, such that it might conceivably render population screening redundant. ? 2014 Heart Rhythm Society.

Methods: Self-reported total sleep time (TST) in 24-hrs, Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores and socio-demographic information were obtained from nullipara and multipara women aged 20-46 yrs at 35-37 weeks pregnant (358 M?ori and 717 non-M?ori), and women in the general population (381 M?ori and 577 non-M?ori). Results: After controlling for ethnicity, age, socio-economic status, and employment status, pregnant women average 30 min less TST than women in the general population. The distribution of TST was also greater in pregnant women, who were 3 times more likely to be short sleepers (?6 h) and 1.9 times more likely to be long sleepers (>9 h). In addition, pregnant women were 1.8 times more likely to report excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS). Pregnant women >30 years of age experienced greater age-related declines in TST. Identifying as M?ori, being unemployed, and working at night increased the likelihood of reporting abnormal sleep duration across all women population in this study. EDS also more likely occurred among M?ori women and women who worked at night. Conclusions: Pregnancy increases the prevalence of abnormal sleep duration and EDS, which are also higher among M?ori than non-M?ori women and those who do night work.

To extract the maximum information from spatter stains, the size, velocity and direction of the drop that produces each stain, and forces acting during flight, must be known.A numerical scheme for accurate modeling of blood drop flight, in typical crime scene conditions, including droplet oscillation, deformation and in-flight disintegration, was developed and validated against analytical and experimental data including passive blood drop oscillations, deformation at terminal velocity, cast-off and impact drop deformation and breakup features. 4th order Runge-Kutta timestepping was used with the Taylor Analogy Breakup (TAB) model and Pilch and Erdman's (1987) expression for breakup time. Experimental data for terminal velocities, oscillations, and deformation was obtained via digital high-speed imaging. A single model was found to describe drop behavior accurately in passive, cast off and impact scenarios.Terminal velocities of typical passive drops falling up to 8. m, distances and times required to reach them were predicted within 5%. Initial oscillations of passive blood drops with diameters of 1. mm. <. d<. 6. mm falling up to 1.5. m were studied. Predictions of oscillating passive drop aspect ratio were within 1.6% of experiment. Under typical crime scene conditions, the velocity of the drop within the first 1.5. m of fall is affected little by drag, oscillation or deformation.Blood drops with diameter 0.4-4. mm and velocity 1-15. m/s cast-off from a rotating disk showed low deformation levels (Weber number. <. 3). Drops formed by blunt impact 0.1-2. mm in diameter at velocities of 14-25. m/s were highly deformed (aspect ratios down to 0.4) and the larger impact blood drops (~1-1.5. mm in diameter) broke up at critical Weber numbers of 12-14. Most break-ups occurred within 10-20. cm of the impact point. The model predicted deformation levels of cast-off and impact blood drops within 5% of experiment. Under typical crime scene conditions, few cast-off drops will break up in flight. However some impact-generated drops were seen to break up, some by the vibration, others by bag breakup.The validated model can be used to gain deep understanding of the processes leading to spatter stains, and can be used to answer questions about proposed scenarios, e.g. how far blood drops may travel, or how stain patterns are affected by winds and draughts. ? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Bloodstain pattern analysis; Drag; Droplet breakup; Droplet oscillation; Numerical modeling; Trajectory,"accuracy; ambient air; Article; blood analysis; blood breakup; blood droplet deformation; blood stain; blood stain pattern analysis; crime; flow kinetics; forensic science; human; investigative procedures; mathematical model; oscillation; Runge Kutta timestepping method; simulation; Taylor Analogy Breakup model; validation study; vibration; wind; air; biophysics; forensic medicine; procedures; statistical model; Air Movements; Biophysical Phenomena; Blood Stains; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Models, Statistical",2-s2.0-84909956465

The rheological properties of the reconstituted water solutions of the food additive powder were investigated, at different mass concentrations (0.05%-3.00%) and temperatures (4. °C, 20. °C, 37. °C and 60. °C), reflecting those of food storage and food consumption, using small and large deformation rheological measurements. Dynamic tests showed that CMC alone, HM and LM pectin alone and their combinations exhibit strong viscoelastic behaviour, under the conditions used in this study.

However, divergence from the Cox-Metz rule is observed when phase separation takes place.

A way of identifying these families before they reach the radar of statutory systems of child protection is through predictive risk modeling (PRM). Using large datasets PRM tools are able to use algorithms with significant capacity to ascertain and stratify children's risk of experiencing maltreatment in the future. In the process, however, they also identify families who may well benefit from support but are not on a maltreatment trajectory - the so called 'false positives' who would not be among those families later identified as mistreating their children. Whilst early identification of families through the use of PRM has the potential to offer opportunities to provide supportive services that could ameliorate future harm to children, it is clear that it also has the potential to mistakenly target and label families as potential child abusers. This article discusses challenges and opportunities associated with the use of PRM in child protection. It briefly discusses the development of PRM in New Zealand, and traverses some of the complex issues as systems attempt to better target limited resources in the context of fiscal restraint. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Child maltreatment prevention; Family needs; Predictive risk modeling; Public health model,,2-s2.0-84908458573

A content analysis was conducted of all food references (branded and non-branded) found in the five magazines with the highest readership among 10-17 year olds, and the three magazines (of which two were already included among the five most popular magazines) targeted to 10-17 year olds. For each of the six magazines, one issue per month (n = 72 issues in total) over a one-year period (December 2012-January 2014) was included. All foods referenced were classified into healthy/unhealthy according to the food-based Ministry of Health classification system. Branded food references (30% of total) were more frequent for unhealthy (43%) compared to healthy (25%) foods. Magazines specifically targeted to children and adolescents contained a significantly higher proportion of unhealthy branded food references (n = 51/71, 72%) compared to the most popular magazines among children and adolescents (n = 133/317, 42%), of which most were targeted to women.

Both branded and non-branded food references were common within magazines targeted at and popular among children and adolescents, and skewed toward unhealthy foods.

The results revealed three distinct viewpoints, which explained 64% of the variance for 31 participants, and emphasized different expectations about responsibility. The food environment protectors (n=17) underscored government responsibility to address unhealthy food environments if voluntary partnerships are ineffective; the partnership pioneers (n=12) recognized government-industry partnerships as legitimate and necessary to address unhealthy food environments; and the commercial market defenders (n=1) emphasized individual responsibility for food choices and rejected government intervention to improve food environments. Consensus issues included: protecting children's right to health; food industry practices that can and should be changed; government working with industry on product reformulation; and building consumer support for economically viable healthy products. Contentious issues were: inadequacy of accountability structures and government inaction to regulate food marketing practices targeting children. We conclude that understanding different viewpoints is a step toward building mutual trust to strengthen accountability structures that may help stakeholders navigate ideologically contentious issues to promote healthy food environments in England. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Accountability; Food Network; Healthy food environments; Public Health Responsibility Deal; Q methodology; Responsibility,accountability; food industry; food market; food quality; methodology; nongovernmental organization; public health; stakeholder; voluntary approach; England; United Kingdom,2-s2.0-84907504156

Defect or damage in the TLR2 and TLR4 pathways can lead to sustained inflammation, characteristic of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The goal of this study was to identify fruit fractions that can be tested further to develop them as complementary therapies for IBD. In order to do this, we identified fruit fractions that mediate their anti-inflammatory response through the TLR4 and TLR2 pathway. Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK)-hTLR4 and hTLR2 cells were stimulated with their respective ligands to induce inflammation. These cells were treated with one of the 12 fractionated fruits and the inflammatory effect measured. 10 of the fruits came up as anti-inflammatory in the hTLR4 assay and nine in the hTLR2 assays. Many of the fruit fractions mediated their anti-inflammatory actions either mainly in their hydrophobic fractions (such as elderberry) or hydrophilic fractions (such as red raspberry), or both. The strongest anti-inflammatory effects were seen for feijoa and blackberry. This study shows that fruits can have multiple fractions eliciting anti-inflammatory effects in a pathway specific manner. This suggests that the compounds found in fruits can act together to produce health benefits by way of reducing inflammation. Exploiting this property of fruits can help develop complimentary therapies for inflammatory diseases. ? 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Inflammation; Inflammatory bowel disease; Polyphenols; Toll-Like receptors,"polyphenol; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 4; antiinflammatory agent; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; lipopolysaccharide; plant extract; TLR2 protein, human; TLR4 protein, human; toll like receptor 2; toll like receptor 4; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell proliferation; cell stimulation; cell viability; colorimetry; controlled study; cytotoxicity; diet therapy; dose response; fractionation; fruit; human; human cell; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; immunoassay; inflammatory bowel disease; metabolic activation; protein expression; scoring system; screening test; signal transduction; chemistry; fruit; HEK293 cell line; inflammation; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; metabolism; Bacteria (microorganisms); Feijoa; Rubus; Rubus idaeus; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Fruit; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Inflammation; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Lipopolysaccharides; NF-kappa B; Plant Extracts; Toll-Like Receptor 2; Toll-Like Receptor 4",2-s2.0-84936940418

Aim This study aimed to investigate prescription medication sharing practices among adults in Auckland, New Zealand. Setting Community pharmacies in Auckland. Method A cross-sectional survey was conducted in ten community pharmacies in Auckland during March, 2012. Clients were invited to complete an anonymous questionnaire to assess their medication sharing practices. Main outcome measures Proportion of respondents reporting lending or borrowing; information provided or received. Results Of all participants (N?=?642), 25.5?% reported borrowing, and 24.1?% reported lending prescribed medicines in the past year. Furthermore, 14.8?% of participants reported ever giving a child’s prescribed medicine to another child in their care, and 49.8?% reported having leftover prescription medicines at home. Of those who borrowed medicines (n?=?164), 56.1?% received written medication instructions from the lender, and of the lenders (n?=?155), 47.1?% provided verbal instructions with the lent medicines. Conclusion The sharing of prescription medicines in Auckland appears to be similar to that reported in other developed countries, and it is now clear that information provision while sharing does not always occur. Approaches to reduce harm resulting from sharing medicines should be explored. ? 2014, Koninklijke Nederlandse Maatschappij ter bevordering der Pharmacie.",Borrowing; Client behaviour; Lending; New Zealand; Prescription medicines; Sharing,"analgesic agent; antiasthmatic agent; antibiotic agent; antihistaminic agent; antihypertensive agent; cardiovascular agent; contraceptive agent; hypocholesterolemic agent; prescription drug; adolescent; adult; aged; allergy; Article; asthma; chronic pain; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; drug use; educational status; ethnicity; European; female; groups by age; health care personnel; health survey; human; hypertension; male; New Zealand; pharmacist; pharmacy; prescription; priority journal; quality control; questionnaire; attitude to health; epidemiology; middle aged; pharmacist; pharmacy; procedures; standards; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Community Pharmacy Services; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Pharmacists; Prescription Drugs; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84922002639

Increased very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) has been associated with gout. The apolipoprotein B (apo B), which is present on VLDL, regulates neutrophil response to MSU crystals and has been positively associated with gout. Furthermore, the gene (A1CF) encoding the complementation factor for the APOB mRNA-editing enzyme is associated with urate levels. However, the relationship of apo B and VLDL with gout and hyperuricaemia (HU) is still unclear. Therefore, we tested the association of VLDL and apo B with HU and with gout compared to HU. Methods: New Zealand European (n = 90) and Maori and Pacific Island (Polynesian) (n = 90) male gout case and control sample sets were divided into normouricaemia (NU), asymptomatic HU and gout groups. Size exclusion chromatography and enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay was used to measure VLDL and apo B. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the risk of gout and HU per unit change in VLDL and apo B. Results: Increased levels of VLDL triglycerides (Tg) were observed in the gout sample set compared to NU and HU in Europeans (P = 1.8 × 10-6 and 1 × 10-3, respectively), but only compared to NU in Polynesians (P = 0.023). This increase was driven by increased number of VLDL particles in the European participants and by the Tg-enrichment of existing VLDL particles in the Polynesian participants. Each mmol/L increase in VLDL Tg was significantly associated with gout in the presence of HU in Europeans, with a similar trend in Polynesians (OR = 7.61, P = 0.011 and 2.84, P = 0.069, respectively). Each μmol/L increase in total apo B trended towards decreased risk of HU (OR = 0.47. P = 0.062) and, conversely, with increased risk of gout compared to HU (OR = 5.60. P = 0.004). Conclusions: Increased VLDL Tg is associated with the risk of gout compared to HU. A genetic approach should be taken to investigate the possibility for causality of VLDL in gout. Apolipoprotein B may have pleiotropic effects in determining HU and gout. ? 2014 Rasheed et al.",,"apolipoprotein B; triacylglycerol; very low density lipoprotein; apolipoprotein B; biological marker; very low density lipoprotein; adult; Article; disease association; European; gel permeation chromatography; gout; human; hyperuricemia; major clinical study; New Zealand; Pacific islands; Polynesian; blood; Caucasian; ethnology; gout; hyperuricemia; male; middle aged; Oceanic ancestry group; Adult; Apolipoproteins B; Biomarkers; European Continental Ancestry Group; Gout; Humans; Hyperuricemia; Lipoproteins, VLDL; Male; Middle Aged; Oceanic Ancestry Group",2-s2.0-84924287920

There are a wide range of options available for treating people with AGW and selection is based on clinician's experience, patient preferences and adverse effects. The imiquimod could offer the advantages of patient-applied therapies without incurring the limitations of provider-administered treatments. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and safety of imiquimod for the treatment of AGW in non-immunocompromised adults. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections Group Specialized Register (15 April 2014), CENTRAL (1991 to 15 April 2014), MEDLINE (1946 to 15 April 2014), EMBASE (1947 to 15 April 2014), LILACS (1982 to 15 April 2014), World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry (ICTRP) (15 April 2014), ClinicalTrials.gov (15 April 2014), Web of Science (2001 to 15 April 2014) and OpenGrey (15 April 2014). We also handsearched conference proceedings, contacted trial authors and reviewed the reference lists of retrieved studies. Selection criteria: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the use of imiquimod with placebo, any other patient-applied or any other provider-administered treatment (excluding interferon and 5-fluorouracil which are assessed in other Cochrane Reviews) for the treatment of AGW in non-immunocompromised adults. Data collection and analysis: Three review authors independently assessed trials for inclusion, extracted data and assessed risk of bias. We resolved any disagreements through consensus. The quality of the evidence was assessed using the GRADE approach. Main results: Ten RCTs (1734 participants) met our inclusion criteria of which six were funded by industry. We judged the risk of bias of the included trials as high. Six trials (1294 participants) compared the use of imiquimod versus placebo. There was very low quality evidence that imiquimod was superior to placebo in achieving complete and partial regression (RR 4.03, 95% CI 2.03 to 7.99; RR 2.56, 95% CI 2.05 to 3.20, respectively). When compared with placebo, the effects of imiquimod on recurrence (RR 2.76, 95% CI 0.70 to 10.91), appearance of new warts (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 1.00) and frequency of systemic adverse reactions (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.32) were imprecise. We downgraded the quality of evidence to low or very low. There was low quality evidence that imiquimod led to more local adverse reactions (RR 1.73, 95% CI 1.18 to 2.53) and pain (RR 11.84, 95% CI 3.36 to 41.63). Two trials (105 participants) compared the use of imiquimod versus any other patient-applied treatment (podophyllotoxin and podophyllin). The estimated effects of imiquimod on complete regression (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.48), partial regression (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.47), recurrence (RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.21 to 1.11) or the presence of local adverse reactions (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.54) were imprecise (very low quality evidence). There was low quality evidence that systemic adverse reactions were less frequent with imiquimod (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.98). Finally, two trials (335 participants) compared imiquimod with any other provider-administered treatment (ablative methods and cryotherapy). There was very low quality of evidence that imiquimod did not have a lower frequency of complete regression (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.56 to 1.28). There was very low quality evidence that imiquimod led to a lower rate of recurrence during six-month follow-up (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.10 to 0.56) but this did not translate in to a lower recurrence from six to 12 months (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.25; very low quality evidence). There was very low quality evidence that imiquimod was associated with less pain (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.54) and fewer local reactions (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.74). Authors' conclusions: The benefits and harms of imiquimod compared with placebo should be regarded with caution due to the risk of bias, imprecision and inconsistency for many of the outcomes we assessed in this Cochrane Review. The evidence for many of the outcomes that show imiquimod and patient-applied treatment (podophyllotoxin or podophyllin) confer similar benefits but fewer systematic reactions with the Imiquimod, is of low or very low quality. The quality of evidence for the outcomes assessing imiquimod and other provider-administered treatment were of very low quality. ? 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,"imiquimod; placebo; aminoquinoline derivative; imiquimod; interferon inducing agent; keratolytic agent; podophyllin; podophyllotoxin; condyloma acuminatum; drug efficacy; drug safety; evidence based medicine; human; meta analysis; outcome assessment; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); remission; Review; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; treatment duration; adult; Anus Diseases; drug self administration; female; Genital Diseases, Female; Genital Diseases, Male; immunocompetence; male; recurrent disease; virology; Warts; Adult; Aminoquinolines; Anus Diseases; Female; Genital Diseases, Female; Genital Diseases, Male; Humans; Immunocompetence; Interferon Inducers; Keratolytic Agents; Male; Podophyllin; Podophyllotoxin; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Self Administration; Warts",2-s2.0-84922236464

Accordingly we investigated the link between changing social circumstances and changing tobacco smoking using repeated measures data.Methods 15 000 adults with at least two observations over three waves (each 2 years apart) of a panel study had data on smoking status, family, labour force, income and deprivation (both neighbourhood and individual). Fixed effects regression modelling was used.Findings The odds of smoking increased 1.42-fold (95% CI 1.16 to 1.74) for a one log-unit increase in personal income among 15-24-year-olds, but there was no association of increased smoking with an increase in income among 25+ year olds. Moving out of a family nucleus, increasing neighbourhood deprivation (eg, 1.83-fold (95% CI 1.18 to 2.83) increased odds of smoking for moving from least to most deprived quintile of neighbourhoods), increasing personal deprivation and moving into employment were all associated with increased odds of smoking. The number of cigarettes smoked a day changed little with changing social circumstances.Interpretation Worsening social circumstances over the short run are generally associated with higher smoking risk. However, there were counter examples: for instance, decreasing personal income among young people was associated with decreased odds of smoking, a finding consistent with income elasticity of demand (the less one’s income, the less one can consume). This paper suggests that improving social circumstances is not always pro-health over the short run; a more nuanced approach to the social determinants of health is required. ? 2014 BMJ Publishing Group.

Here we describe the design of a novel PROTAC (proteolysis targeting chimeric molecule) capable of simultaneously inducing the degradation of the X-protein, and antagonizing its function. The PROTAC was constructed by fusing the N-terminal oligomerization and C-terminal instability domains of the X-protein to each other, and rendering them cell-permeable by the inclusion of a polyarginine cell-penetrating peptide (CPP). It was predicted that the oligomerization domain would bind the X-protein, and that the instability domain would cause the X-protein to be targeted for proteasomal degradation. Addition of the PROTAC to HepG2 liver cancer cells, engineered to express full-length and C-terminally truncated forms of the X-protein, resulted in the degradation of both forms of the X-protein. A cell-permeable stand-alone form of the oligomerization domain was taken up by HepG2 cells, and acted as a dominant-negative inhibitor, causing inhibition of X-protein-induced apoptosis. In summary, the PROTAC described here induces the degradation of the X-protein, and antagonizes its function, and warrants investigation in a preclinical study for its ability to prevent or treat HBV infection and/or the development of HCC. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Horizontal and vertical distortion magnitudes were calculated for each of the three assessments. Distortion magnitudes were significantly higher in patients than controls in all assessments. There was no significant difference in magnitude of distortion across different macular diseases. There were no significant correlations between overall magnitude of distortion among any of the three measures and no significant correlations in localized measures of distortion.Conclusions. Three alternative quantifications of monocular spatial distortion in the central visual field generated uncorrelated estimates of visual distortion. It is therefore unlikely that metamorphopsia is caused solely by retinal displacement, but instead involves additional top-down information, knowledge about the scene, and perhaps, cortical reorganization.Purpose. Patients with macular disease often report experiencing metamorphopsia (visual distortion). Although typically measured with Amsler charts, more quantitative assessments of perceived distortion are desirable to effectively monitor the presence, progression, and remediation of visual impairment.Methods. Participants with binocular (n = 33) and monocular (n = 50) maculopathy across seven disease groups, and control participants (n = 10) with no identifiable retinal disease completed a modified Amsler grid assessment (presented on a computer screen with eye tracking to ensure fixation compliance) and two novel assessments to measure metamorphopsia in the central 58 of visual field. A total of 81% (67/83) of participants completed a hyperacuity task where they aligned eight dots in the shape of a square, and 64% (32/50) of participants with monocular distortion completed a spatial alignment task using dichoptic stimuli.

There is strong evidence however, that the adequate control of asthma can improve health outcomes for mothers and their babies. Despite known risks of poorly controlled asthma during pregnancy, a large proportion of women have sub-optimal asthma control, due to concerns surrounding risks of pharmacological agents, and uncertainties regarding the effectiveness and safety of different management strategies. Objectives: To assess the effects of interventions (pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic) for managing women's asthma in pregnancy on maternal and fetal/infant outcomes. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's Trials Register (2 June 2014) and the Cochrane Airways Group's Trials Register (4 June 2014). Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing any intervention used to manage asthma in pregnancy, with placebo, no intervention, or an alternative intervention. We included pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions (including combined interventions). Cluster-randomised trials were eligible for inclusion (but none were identified). Cross-over trials were not eligible for inclusion. We included multi-armed trials along with two-armed trials. We also included studies published as abstracts only. Data collection and analysis: At least two review authors independently assessed trial eligibility and quality and extracted data. Data were checked for accuracy. Main results: We included eight trials in this review, involving 1181 women and their babies. Overall we judged two trials to be at low risk of bias, two to be of unclear risk of bias, and four to be at moderate risk of bias. Five trials assessed pharmacological agents, including inhaled corticosteroids (beclomethasone or budesonide), inhaled magnesium sulphate, intravenous theophylline, and inhaled beclomethasone verus oral theophylline. Three trials assessed non-pharmacological interventions, including a fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)-based algorithm versus a clinical guideline-based algorithm to adjust inhaled corticosteroid therapy, a pharmacist-led multi-disciplinary approach to management versus standard care, and progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) versus sham training. The eight included trials were assessed under seven separate comparisons. Pharmacological interventions Primary outcomes: one trial suggested that inhaled magnesium sulphate in addition to usual treatment could reduce exacerbation frequency in acute asthma (mean difference (MD) -2.80; 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.21 to -2.39; 60 women). One trial assessing the addition of intravenous theophylline to standard care in acute asthma did not report on exacerbations (65 women). No clear difference was shown in the risk of exacerbations with the use of inhaled beclomethasone in addition to usual treatment for maintenance therapy in one trial (risk ratio (RR) 0.36; 95% CI 0.13 to 1.05; 60 women); a second trial also showed no difference, however data were not clearly reported to allow inclusion in a meta-analysis. No difference was shown when inhaled beclomethasone was compared with oral theophylline for maintenance therapy (RR 0.88; 95% CI 0.59 to 1.33; one trial, 385 women). None of these trials reported on neonatal intensive care admissions. Secondary outcomes: inhaled magnesium sulphate in acute asthma was shown to improve lung function measures (one trial, 60 women); intravenous theophylline in acute asthma was not associated with benefits (one trial, 65 women). No clear differences were seen with the addition of inhaled corticosteroids to routine treatment in three trials (374 women). While inhaled beclomethasone, compared with oral theophylline, significantly reduced treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects in one trial (384 women), no other differences were observed, except for higher treatment adherence with theophylline. Four of the five trials did not report on adverse effects. Non-pharmacological interventions Primary outcomes: in one trial, the use of a FENO-based algorithm was shown to significantly reduce asthma exacerbations (RR 0.61; 95% CI 0.41 to 0.90; 220 women); and a trend towards fewer neonatal hospitalisations was observed (RR 0.46; 95% CI 0.21 to 1.02; 214 infants). No exacerbations occurred in one trial assessing pharmacist-led management; this approach did not reduce neonatal intensive care admissions (RR 1.50; 95% CI 0.27 to 8.32; 58 infants). One trial (64 women) assessing PMR did not report on exacerbations or neonatal intensive care admissions. Secondary outcomes: the use of a FENO-based algorithm to adjust therapy led to some improvements in quality of life scores, as well as more frequent use of inhaled corticosteroids and long-acting β-agonists, and less frequent use of short-acting β-agonists (one trial, 220 women). The FENO-based algorithm was associated with fewer infants with recurrent episodes of bronchiolitis in their first year of life, and a trend towards fewer episodes of croup for infants. Pharmacist-led management improved asthma control scores at six months (one trial, 60 women); PMR improved lung function and quality of life measures (one trial, 64 women). No other differences between comparisons were observed. Authors' conclusions: Based on eight included trials, of moderate quality overall, no firm conclusions about optimal interventions for managing asthma in pregnancy can be made. Five trials assessing pharmacological interventions did not provide clear evidence of benefits or harms to support or refute current practice. While inhaled magnesium sulphate for acute asthma was shown to reduce exacerbations, this was in one small trial of unclear quality, and thus this finding should be interpreted with caution. Three trials assessing non-pharmacological interventions provided some support for the use of such strategies, however were not powered to detect differences in important maternal and infant outcomes. While a FENO-based algorithm reduced exacerbations, the effects on perinatal outcomes were less certain, and thus widespread implementation is not yet appropriate. Similarly, though positive effects on asthma control were shown with PMR and pharmacist-led management, the evidence to date is insufficient to draw definitive conclusions. In view of the limited evidence base, further randomised trials are required to determine the most effective and safe interventions for asthma in pregnancy. Future trials must be sufficiently powered, and well-designed, to allow differences in important outcomes for mothers and babies to be detected. The impact on health services requires evaluation. Any further trials assessing pharmacological interventions should assess novel agents or those used in current practice. Encouragingly, at least five trials have been identified as planned or underway. ? 2014 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,beclometasone; beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; budesonide; corticosteroid; long acting drug; magnesium sulfate; methylprednisolone; salbutamol; theophylline; antiasthmatic agent; beclometasone; corticosteroid; magnesium sulfate; nitric oxide; theophylline; asthma; clinical effectiveness; clinical practice; diet therapy; disease exacerbation; drug safety; exercise; forced expiratory volume; fractional exhaled nitric oxide; health care utilization; health service; homeopathy; human; insomnia; lifestyle modification; lung function; maintenance therapy; medication compliance; meta analysis; muscle relaxation; nervousness; patient education; practice guideline; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; priority journal; psychotherapy; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); respiratory tract inflammation; Review; self care; side effect; systematic review; treatment outcome; treatment planning; treatment response; unspecified side effect; vomiting; algorithm; asthma; female; pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Algorithms; Anti-Asthmatic Agents; Asthma; Beclomethasone; Female; Humans; Magnesium Sulfate; Muscle Relaxation; Nitric Oxide; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Theophylline,2-s2.0-84921942808

We systematically reviewed findings from the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), one of the longest and largest observational studies, to assess the number and strength of the associations reported and to determine if they have been confirmed in RCTs. Methods: We reviewed NHS publication abstracts from 1978-2012, extracted information on associations tested, and graded the strength of the reported effect sizes. We searched PubMed for RCTs or systematic reviews for 3 health outcomes commonly reported in NHS publications: breast cancer, ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and osteoporosis. NHS results were compared with RCT results and deemed concordant when the difference in effect sizes between studies was ?0.15. Findings: 2007 associations between health outcomes and independent variables were reported in 1053 abstracts. 58.0% (1165/2007) were statistically significant, and 22.2% (445/2007) were neutral (no association). Among the statistically significant results that reported a numeric odds ratio (OR) or relative risk (RR), 70.5% (706/1002) reported a weak association (OR/RR 0.5-2.0), 24.5% (246/1002) a moderate association (OR/RR 0.25-0.5 or 2.0-4.0) and 5.0% (50/1002) a strong association (OR/RR ?0.25 or ?4.0). 19 associations reported in NHS publications for breast cancer, IHD and osteoporosis have been tested in RCTs, and the concordance between NHS and RCT results was low (?25%). Conclusions: NHS publications contain a large number of analyses, the majority of which reported statistically significant but weak associations. Few of these associations have been tested in RCTs, and where they have, the agreement between NHS results and RCTs is poor. ? 2014 Tai et al.",,acetylsalicylic acid; alpha tocopherol; beta carotene; calcium; estrogen; fluoride; folic acid; gestagen; linolenic acid; omega 3 fatty acid; pyridoxine; vitamin D; Article; breast cancer; calcium intake; cohort analysis; content analysis; coronary artery disease; diet supplementation; effect size; heart infarction; human; ischemic heart disease; low drug dose; Medline; observational study; osteoporosis; outcome assessment; publication; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; Breast Neoplasms; comparative study; female; Myocardial Ischemia; nurse; observational study; osteoporosis; risk; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Myocardial Ischemia; Nurses; Observational Study as Topic; Odds Ratio; Osteoporosis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-84908120536

The beliefs of people receiving treatment are researched less often. Method An online survey on causal beliefs about depression and experiences with antidepressants was completed by 1829 New Zealand adults prescribed anti-depressants in the preceding five years, 97.4% of whom proceeded to take antidepressants. Results The most frequently endorsed of 17 causal beliefs were family stress, relationship problems, loss of loved one, financial problems, isolation, and abuse or neglect in childhood. Factor analysis produced three factors: 'bio-genetic', 'adulthood stress' and 'childhood adversity'. The most strongly endorsed explanations for increases in antidepressant prescribing invoked improved identification, reduced stigma and drug company marketing. The least strongly endorsed was 'Anti-depressants are the best treatment'. Regression analyses revealed that self-reported efficacy of the antidepressants was positively associated with bio-genetic causal beliefs, negatively associated with childhood adversity beliefs and unrelated to adulthood stress beliefs. The belief that 'People cannot' get better by themselves even if they try' was positively associated with bio-genetic beliefs. Limitations The convenience sample may have been biased towards a favourable view of bio-genetic explanations, since 83% reported that the medication reduced their depression. Conclusions Clinicians' should consider exploring patients' causal beliefs. The public, even when taking antidepressants, continues to hold a multi-factorial causal model of depression with a primary emphasis on psycho-social causes. A three factor model of those beliefs may lead to more sophisticated understandings of relationships with stigma variables. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Antidepressants; Causal beliefs; Depression; Prognostic pessimism; Stigma,"antidepressant agent; adult; attitude; child; child abuse; complication; depression; epidemiology; etiology; factorial analysis; family; female; human; human relation; male; mental stress; middle aged; motivation; New Zealand; prescription; psychology; questionnaire; selection bias; social stigma; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Antidepressive Agents; Attitude; Child; Child Abuse; Depression; Drug Prescriptions; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Family; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; New Zealand; Questionnaires; Sampling Studies; Selection Bias; Social Stigma; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-84905012183

As the global prevalence of hypertension increases, so too has the recognition of resistant hypertension. Whilst figures vary, the proportion of hypertensive patients that are resistant to multiple drug therapies have been reported to be as high as 16.4?%. Resistant hypertension is typically associated with elevated sympathetic activity and abnormal homeostatic reflex control and is termed neurogenic hypertension because of its presumed central autonomic nervous system origin. This resistance to conventional pharmacological treatment has stimulated a plethora of medical devices to be investigated for use in hypertension, with varying degrees of success. In this review, we discuss a new therapy for drug-resistant hypertension, deep brain stimulation. The utility of deep brain stimulation in resistant hypertension was first discovered in patients with concurrent neuropathic pain, where it lowered blood pressure and improved baroreflex sensitivity. The most promising central target for stimulation is the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray, which has been well characterised in animal studies as a control centre for autonomic outflow. In this review, we will discuss the promise and potential mechanisms of deep brain stimulation in the treatment of severe, resistant hypertension. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Baroreflex; Deep brain stimulation; Periaqueductal gray; Resistant hypertension,antihypertensive therapy; autonomic nervous system; brain depth stimulation; human; medical device; nonhuman; pressoreceptor reflex; resistant hypertension; Review; sympathetic nerve; adrenergic system; animal; blood pressure; hypertension; pathophysiology; Animals; Autonomic Nervous System; Blood Pressure; Deep Brain Stimulation; Humans; Hypertension; Sympathetic Nervous System,2-s2.0-84920800177

Yet, we have limited insight into what innovative pharmacy services would support this consumer group to manage their condition/s. The aim of this study was to identify what innovations people with chronic conditions and their carers want from their ideal community pharmacy, and compare with what pharmacists and pharmacy support staff think consumers want.Methods. We elicited ideas using the nominal group technique. Participants included people with chronic conditions, unpaid carers, pharmacists and pharmacy support staff, in four regions of Australia. Themes were identified via thematic analysis using the constant comparison method.Results: Fifteen consumer/carer, four pharmacist and two pharmacy support staff groups were conducted. Two overarching themes were identified: extended scope of practice for the pharmacist and new or improved pharmacy services. The most innovative role for Australian pharmacists was medication continuance, within a limited time-frame. Consumers and carers wanted improved access to pharmacists, but this did not necessarily align with a faster or automated dispensing service. Other ideas included streamlined access to prescriptions via medication reminders, electronic prescriptions and a chronic illness card.Conclusions: This study provides further support for extending the pharmacist's role in medication continuance, particularly as it represents the consumer's voice. How this is done, or the methods used, needs to optimise patient safety. A range of innovative strategies were proposed and Australian community pharmacies should advocate for and implement innovative approaches to improve access and ensure continuity of care. ? 2014McMillan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd. ? 2014 McMillan et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Australia; Chronic disease; Innovation; Nominal group technique; Pharmacies; Prescribing,Australia; caregiver; chronic disease; health care delivery; health service; human; information processing; mass communication; medication compliance; pharmacist; pharmacy; professional standard; psychology; Australia; Caregivers; Chronic Disease; Delivery of Health Care; Diffusion of Innovation; Focus Groups; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Medication Adherence; Pharmacies; Pharmacists; Professional Role,2-s2.0-84908112560

Given conflicting evidence regarding the effectiveness of such programmes, the present paper conducted a critical appraisal of systematic reviews assessing the effectiveness of interventions in reducing back pain and injuries among healthcare staff. A realist synthesis was conducted on a second set of reports to identify best practices for moving and handling programmes.DESIGN: A critical appraisal of systematic reviews and a realist synthesis to identify best practices for moving and handling programmes.DATA SOURCES: A literature search of five databases (Medline, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and ScienceDirect) located 150 reports assessing programme outcomes published in refereed journals between 2000 and 2013.REVIEW METHODS: The critical appraisal included six systematic reviews. The realist synthesis included 47 studies that provided descriptive information about programme mechanisms.RESULTS: Five of the six systematic reviews covered interventions involving either staff training or training and equipment supply. One review covered multi-component interventions. All concluded that training staff by itself was ineffective. There were differing conclusions regarding the effectiveness of training and equipment interventions and multi-component programmes. The reviews provided little information about the content of programme components. The realist synthesis noted the need for management commitment and support, and six core programme components; a policy requiring safe transfer practices, ergonomic assessment of spaces where people are transferred, transfer equipment including lifts, specific risk assessment protocols, adequate training of all care staff, and coordinators coaches or resource staff. These programme components are likely to be synergistic; omitting one component weakens the impact of the other components.CONCLUSIONS: Five systematic reviews provided little information regarding the core components of effective programmes. Given the absence of experimental trials for multi-component programmes, the best available evidence for the effectiveness of multi-component programmes is from pre-post studies and large-scale surveys. The realist synthesis provided detailed information about the core components for effective programmes. Further studies, which include qualitative data, are needed to provide evidence about the specific mechanisms through which components contribute to effective patient handling programmes.

First, in order to account for heart deformations due to respiratory motion and heart contraction, a two-step registration methodology is proposed, which has the ability to account for the global and local motions of the heart. The methodology involves an affine-based registration followed by a local B-splines alignment to maximize a new similarity function based on the first- and second-order normalized mutual information. Then the myocardium is segmented using a level-set function, its evolution being constrained by three features, namely, a weighted shape prior, a pixelwise mixed object/background image intensity distribution, and an energy of a second-order binary MarkovGibbs random field spatial model. At the third stage, residual segmentation errors and imperfection of image alignment are reduced by employing a Laplace-based registration refinement step that provides accurate pixelon-pixel matches on all segmented frames to generate accurate parametric perfusion maps. Finally, physiology is characterized by pixel-by-pixel mapping of empirical indexes (peak signal intensity, time-to-peak, initial upslope, and the average signal change of the slowly varying agent delivery phase), based on contrast agent dynamics.Results: The authors tested our framework on 24 perfusion data sets from 8 patients with ischemic damage who are undergoing a novel myoregeneration therapy. The performance of the processing steps of our framework is evaluated using both synthetic and in-vivo data. First, our registration methodology is evaluated using realistic synthetic phantoms and a distance-based error metric, and an improvement of registration is documented using the proposed similarity measure (P-value ? 10?4). Second, evaluation of our segmentation using the Dice similarity coefficient, documented an average of 0.910 ± 0.037 compared to two other segmentation methods that achieved average values of 0.862 ± 0.045 and 0.844 ± 0.047. Also, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis of our multifeature segmentation yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.92, while segmentation based intensity alone showed low performance (an area of 0.69). Moreover, our framework indicated the ability, using empirical perfusion indexes, to reveal regional perfusion improvements with therapy and transmural perfusion differences across the myocardial wall.Conclusions: By quantitative and visual assessment, our framework documented the ability to characterize regional and transmural perfusion, thereby it augmenting the ability to assess follow-up treatment for patients undergoing myoregeneration therapy. This is afforded by our framework being able to handle both global and local deformations of the heart, segment accurately the myocardial wall, and provide accurate pixel-on-pixel matches of registered perfusion images. ? 2014 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",deformable model; ischemic heart disease; level-set segmentation; nonrigid registration; perfusion MRI,"Article; breathing; clinical article; controlled study; heart contraction; heart muscle; heart muscle perfusion; human; human tissue; ischemic heart disease; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; perfusion weighted imaging; phantom; receiver operating characteristic; regional perfusion; tissue distribution; algorithm; area under the curve; automated pattern recognition; biological model; computer assisted diagnosis; devices; evaluation study; heart; image quality; magnetic resonance angiography; motion; Myocardial Ischemia; myocardial perfusion imaging; pathology; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Heart; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Models, Cardiovascular; Motion; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardial Ischemia; Myocardial Perfusion Imaging; Myocardium; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Phantoms, Imaging; Reproducibility of Results; Respiration; ROC Curve; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-84908434315

Phase 3: The relationship of two shortlisted markers and AAA presence was assessed. Results: iTRAQ identified eight proteins with biomarker potential. Microarray data identified 72 and 96 potential biomarkers from ApoE-/- mice and human patients, respectively. All three datasets suggested apolipoprotein C1 (ApoC1) as a marker for AAA; microarray data identified matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) as a second potential marker.

Field observations and semi-structured key informant interviews were carried out during 2012 and 2013 to assess the existing WASH situation in the peri-urban Ger areas of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. In addition, a knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) survey was conducted by Action Contre la Faim (ACF) Mongolia in 210 households to identify the sources of WASH-borne hazards in a statistically representative way. Moreover, the quality of drinking water was analyzed both at the household (n=210) and water point (kiosk) (n=40) levels to assess the risk of chemical and pathogenic contaminants. Both field observations and interviews revealed that the sanitary environment of the Ger residents is characterized by the lack of a drainage system, unimproved sanitation technology (e.g. unhygienic pit latrines and soak pits), unsafe water supply, and insufficient collection, transportation, and storage mechanisms. Poor infrastructure is associated with low standards of living. The transmission of WASH-borne disease (e.g. diarrhea, dysentery, hepatitis A) is the gravest consequence and source of hazards. The results from the water quality analysis demonstrate that Ger residents are more exposed to biological contamination of stored drinking water by Escherichia coli during the summer (May to August) than in the winter (November to February). During the winter, 36% of household storage containers were contaminated by E.coli at an average level of 12.5 E.coli per 100ml, while, during the summer, 56% of household storage containers were contaminated at an average level of 50 E.coli per 100ml. KAP surveys further reveal that the common practice of Ger residents to discharge greywater (with higher chemical oxygen demand) into pit latrines, soak-pits, yards, and streets likely causes environmental pollution and health hazards. Multifaceted WASH-borne exposure was addressed by the scoping study such that various WASH interventions could be planned for the study area and beyond. To tackle the above challenges and problems, a range of appropriate interventions and programs are recommended to reduce the exposure of WASH-borne hazards in the study area and other parts of the world - in both urban and peri-urban settings. The recommendations include: the development and implementation of a water safety plan (WSP), an effective monitoring system for collection, transportation and storage at both water kiosk and household levels, user training for correct use of water containers, effective coordination among stakeholders (including urban planners), development of a household greywater disposal system, and implementation of a functioning solid waste management system. Prior to taking these actions, a detailed study on the 'pollution load from peri-urban to urban' should be carried out to assess the WASH-borne vulnerability of both peri-urban and central urban population. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Hazards; Health; Peri-urban; Sustainable sanitation; WASH; Water kiosk,coliform bacterium; disease transmission; drainage; drinking water; hazard assessment; health risk; periurban area; pollution exposure; sanitation; water quality; Central Province [Mongolia]; Mongolia; Ulaanbaatar,2-s2.0-84907966902

Nano-liposomes were prepared by thin-film hydration in conjugation with active drug loading using ammonium sulphate and post-insertion with Poloxamer 188. A stability-indicating HPLC assay with diode array detection was developed for the determination of ASL concentrations. The U-shaped pH-solubility profile in aqueous solutions, with a lowest solubility at pH 7.4 (0.843 μg/mL), indicated that ASL is an ampholyte, and dilution or neutralization of acidic drug solutions used in clinical trials with physiological fluids may cause drug precipitation. The basic pK<inf>a</inf> value measured by absorbance spectroscopy was 6.72. The log D value at pH 3.8 was 1.15 which increased to 3.24 as pH increased to 7.4. ASL was found to be the most stable in acidic conditions and degraded most rapidly in alkaline conditions. An extra-liposomal pH of 5.6 during drug loading was found to be optimal to achieve the highest drug loading (DL) of 4.76% and entrapment efficiency (EE) of 99.9%. At this pH, >90% of ASL was ionized conferring high drug solubility (1 mg/mL) and acted as a reservoir of unionized ASL to be transported into liposomal cores.

Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by central obesity and insulin resistance; little is known about how MetS affects the sensitivity of the mTOR pathway to feeding.Methods. The responsiveness of mTOR pathway targets such as p706Sk to a high protein meal containing either dairy or soy foods was investigated in healthy insulin sensitive middle-aged men and those presenting with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Twenty male subjects (10 healthy controls, 10 MetS) participated in a single-blinded randomized cross-over study. In a random sequence, subjects ingested energy-matched breakfasts composed predominately of either dairy-protein or soy-protein foods. Skeletal muscle biopsies were collected in the fasted state and at 2 and 4 h post-meal ingestion for the analysis of mTOR- and insulin-signalling kinase activation.Results: Phosphorylated Akt and Insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) increased during the postabsorptive period with no difference between groups. mTOR (Ser448) and ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation increased 2 h following dairy meal consumption only. p70S6K (Thr389) phosphorylation was increased after feeding only in the control subjects and not in the MetS group.Conclusions: These data demonstrate that the consumption of a dairy-protein rich but not a soy-protein rich breakfast activates the phosphorylation of mTOR and ribosomal protein S6, required for protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle. Unlike healthy controls, subjects with MetS did not increase muscle p70S6K(Thr389) phosphorylation in response to a mixed meal. Trial registration.

It is not known how distance to school relates to sedentary behavior in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between distance to school and children's sedentary behavior during weekdays at times where children interact with the neighborhood environment. Children (5-13 years, nD295) who participated in the understanding relationships between activity and neighborhoods study (2008-2010) across four New Zealand cities wore a hip-mounted accelerometer for 7 days. Minutes spent sedentary (accelerometer count &lt;100 min-1) were derived for the school travel periods (0800-0859 and 1500-1559) and after school discretionary time (1600-1759). Shortest street network distance to school was calculated from residential addresses using geographical information systems and parsed into tertiles for analysis. Children completed a daily travel log including mode of transport to and from school, which was dichotomized into active (walking and cycling) and passive (motorized) modes. Children living in the second tertile of distance from schoolwere the least sedentary during the school traveling periods (42-10%, mean-true between-child SD) compared to those living in the first or third distance tertiles (47-10 and 49-10%, respectively); the differences were clear and likely substantial (90% confidence limits-6%). Children who traveled by motorized transport were more sedentary for each of the distance tertiles (50 versus 44%, 46 versus 39%, and 54 versus 27% for first, second, and third tertiles, respectively; 90% confidence limits-7%). In the period of 1600-1759, girls in the third distance tertile were the most sedentary.

We evaluated a specialist nurse-led intervention in the primary care setting to address accepted risk factors in a study sample of adults at 'high risk of CKD progression', defined as uncontrolled type II diabetes and/or hypertension and a history of poor clinic attendance.Methods. The study was a non-controlled quality improvement study with pre- and post- intervention comparisons to test feasibility and potential effectiveness. Patients within two primary care practices were screened and recruited to the study. Fifty-two patients were enrolled, with 36 completing 12-months follow-up. The intervention involved a series of sessions led by the nephrology Nurse Practitioner with assistance from practice nurses. These sessions included assessment, education and planned medication and lifestyle changes. The primary outcome measured was proteinuria (ACR), and the secondary outcomes estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and 5-year absolute CV risk. Several 'intermediary' secondary outcomes were also measured including: blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), body mass index (BMI), prevalence of active smoking, a variety of self-management domains, and medication prescription. Analysis of data was performed using linear and logistic regression as appropriate.Results: There was a significant improvement in ACR (average decrease of -6.75 mg/mmol per month) over the course of the study. There was a small but significant decrease in eGFR and a reduction in 5 year absolute CV risk. Blood pressure, serum total cholesterol, and HbA1c all decreased significantly. Adherence to lifestyle advice improved with a significant reduction in prevalence of active smoking, although there was no significant change in BMI. Self-management significantly improved across all relevant domains.Conclusions: The results suggest that a collaborative model of care between specialist renal nurses and primary care clinicians may improve the management of risk factors for progression of CKD and CV death. Further larger, controlled studies are warranted to definitively determine the effectiveness and costs of this intervention. Trial registration.

Obesity is a risk factor for the development of new-onset diabetes after transplantation, and is associated with reduced graft survival. There is a lack of evidence for effective interventions to prevent weight gain after kidney transplantation. Methods/Design: The effect of INTEnsive Nutrition interventions on weight gain after kidney Transplantation (INTENT) trial is a single-blind (outcomes assessor), randomised controlled trial to assess the effect of intensive nutrition interventions, including exercise advice, on weight gain and metabolic parameters in the first year after transplantation. Participants will be randomised during the first post-transplant month to either standard care (four visits with a renal dietitian over twelve months) or intensive nutrition intervention (eight visits with a renal dietitian over the first six months, four visits over the second six months, and three visits over the first six months with an exercise physiologist). In the intensive intervention group, nutrition counselling will be provided using motivational interviewing techniques to encourage quality engagement. Collaborative goal setting will be used to develop personalised nutrition care plans. Individualised advice regarding physical activity will be provided by an exercise physiologist. The primary outcome of the study is weight at six months after transplant, adjusted for baseline (one month post-transplant) weight, obesity and gender. Secondary outcomes will include changes in weight and other anthropometric measures over 12 months, body composition (in vivo neutron activation analysis, total body potassium, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and bioelectrical impedance), biochemistry (fasting glucose, lipids, haemoglobin A1c and insulin), dietary intake and nutritional status, quality of life, and physical function. Discussion: There are currently few randomised clinical trials of nutrition interventions after kidney transplantation. The INTENT trial will thus provide important data on the effect of intensive nutrition interventions on weight gain after transplant and the associated metabolic consequences. Additionally, by assessing changes in glucose metabolism, the study will also provide data on the feasibility of undertaking larger multi-centre trials of nutrition interventions to reduce the incidence or severity of diabetes after transplantation.

This paper outlines the 'ACTIVE' study, designed to test whether the Model Communities Programme in two New Zealand cities is increasing walking and cycling. The intervention consists of the introduction of cycle and walkway infrastructure, along with measures to encourage active travel. This paper focuses on the rationale for our chosen study design and methods.Method: The study design is multi-level and quasi-experimental, with two intervention and two control cities. Baseline measures were taken in 2011 and follow-up measures in 2012 and 2013. Our face-to-face surveys measured walking and cycling, but also awareness, attitudes and habits. We measured explanatory and confounding factors for mode choice, including socio-demographic and well-being variables. Data collected from the same households on either two or three occasions will be analysed using multi-level models that take account of clustering at the household and individual levels. A cost-benefit analysis will also be undertaken, using our estimates of carbon savings from mode shifts. The matching of the intervention and control cities was quite close in terms of socio-demographic variables, including ethnicity, and baseline levels of walking and cycling.Discussion: This multidisciplinary study provides a strong design for evaluating an intervention to increase walking and cycling in a developed country with relatively low baseline levels of active travel. Its strengths include the use of data from control cities as well as intervention cities, an extended evaluation period with a reasonable response rate from a random community survey and the availability of instrumental variables for sensitivity analyses. ? 2014 Chapman et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Active travel; Attitudes; Cycling; Methods; New Zealand; Physical activity; Quasi-experimental; Walking,adult; clinical trial; cycling; follow up; health behavior; health promotion; human; methodology; New Zealand; procedures; psychology; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; urban population; walking; Adult; Bicycling; Follow-Up Studies; Health Behavior; Health Promotion; Humans; New Zealand; Research Design; Treatment Outcome; Urban Population; Walking,2-s2.0-84907576269

We examine one facilitative factor in this team-based approach - the co-location of non-physician disciplines within the primary care practice.Methods. We used survey data from 330 General Practices in Ontario, Canada and New Zealand, as a part of a multinational study using The Quality and Costs of Primary Care in Europe (QUALICOPC) surveys. Logistic and linear multivariable regression models were employed to examine the association between the number of disciplines working within the practice, and the capacity of the practice to offer specialized and preventive care for patients with chronic conditions.Results: We found that as the number of non-physicians increased, so did the availability of special sessions/clinics for patients with diabetes (odds ratio 1.43, 1.25-1.65), hypertension (1.20, 1.03-1.39), and the elderly (1.22, 1.05-1.42). Co-location was also associated with the provision of disease management programs for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and asthma; the equipment available in the centre; and the extent of nursing services.Conclusions: The care of people with chronic disease is the 'challenge of the century'.

An interpretative narrative synthesis was undertaken and emergent themes analysed and reported. Results: Eighteen studies were included in the final analysis. There were seven main themes which including; education, financial incentives, advertising to promote generic medicines, free generic medicine trials, administrative forms and medicines use review (MUR). These themes were further classified into subthemes. Education was subdivided into consumer and physician education. Financial incentives included the influence of financial incentives on both consumers and physicians. The subthemes in the financial incentives category included the changes in co-payment for consumers, reward payment for physicians and fund-holding schemes. Advertising included the sub-themes of print media and the use of anthropomorphic images, while free generic medicines trial was made up of free vouchers for generic medicines and generic medicines sampling system. Conclusions: The studies have mixed results; some interventions in some settings were useful, while others were not. Not all interventions consistently improved the uptake of generic medicines.

We explored the feasibility of using a mobile selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS) device, housed in a van, to determine ambient air and breath levels of benzene, xylene and toluene following exercise in areas of high motor vehicle traffic. The breath toluene, xylene and benzene concentration of healthy subjects were measured before and after exercising close to a busy road. The concentration of the volatile organic compounds (VOCs), in ambient air were also analysed in real time. Exercise close to traffic pollution is associated with a two-fold increase in breath VOCs (benzene, xylene and toluene) with levels returning to baseline within 20 min. This effect is not seen when exercising away from traffic pollution sources. Situating the testing device 50 m from the road reduced any confounding due to VOCs in the inspired air prior to the breath testing manoeuvre itself.

We have chosen trametinib, a drug targeting MEK in the ERK pathway, to address two questions. Firstly, does inhibition of a signaling pathway, as measured by protein phosphorylation, predict the antiproliferative activity of trametinib? Secondly, do inhibitors of the mTOR and PI3K pathways synergize with trametinib in their effects on cell proliferation? A panel of 30 human breast cancer cell lines was chosen to include lines that could be classified according to whether they were ER and PR positive, HER2 over-expressing, and ""triple negative"". Everolimus (targeting mTOR), NVP-BEZ235 and GSK2126458 (both targeting PI3K/mTOR) were chosen for combination experiments. Inhibition of cell proliferation was measured by IC<inf>50</inf> values and pathway utilization was measured by phosphorylation of signaling kinases. Overall, no correlation was found between trametinib IC<inf>50</inf> values and inhibition of ERK signaling. Inhibition of ERK phosphorylation was observed at trametinib concentrations not affecting proliferation, and sensitivity of cell proliferation to trametinib was found in cell lines with low ERK phosphorylation. Evidence was found for synergy between trametinib and either everolimus, NVP-BEZ235 or GSK2126458, but this was cell line specific. The results have implications for the clinical application of PI3K/mTOR and MEK inhibitors. ? 2014 Leung et al.",,"dactolisib; everolimus; gsk 2126458; mitogen activated protein kinase; omipalisib; tamoxifen; trametinib; unclassified drug; 2,4-difluoro-N-(2-(methyloxy)-5-(4-(4-pyridazinyl)-6-quinolinyl)-3-pyridinyl)benzenesulfonamide; antineoplastic agent; dactolisib; everolimus; imidazole derivative; mitogen activated protein kinase; MTOR protein, human; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; pyridone derivative; pyrimidinone derivative; quinoline derivative; rapamycin; sulfonamide; target of rapamycin kinase; trametinib; antineoplastic activity; article; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cancer cell culture; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation; cell specificity; controlled study; drug potentiation; drug resistance; drug response; drug sensitivity; drug sensitization; drug targeting; human; human cell; IC 50; prediction; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; analogs and derivatives; antagonists and inhibitors; breast tumor; drug effects; female; IC50; MCF 7 cell line; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Western blotting; Antineoplastic Agents; Blotting, Western; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Drug Synergism; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Female; Humans; Imidazoles; Inhibitory Concentration 50; MAP Kinase Signaling System; MCF-7 Cells; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pyridones; Pyrimidinones; Quinolines; Signal Transduction; Sirolimus; Sulfonamides; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases",2-s2.0-84932156996

The objective of this study was to analyze the medical resource utilization among new smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. We also estimated the cost of tuberculosis treatment from the provider and patient perspectives, and identified the significant cost driving factors. Methods. All new smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients who were registered at the chest clinic of the Penang General Hospital, between March 2010 and February 2011, were invited to participate in the study. Provider sector costs were estimated using bottom-up, micro-costing technique. For the calculation of costs from the patients' perspective, all eligible patients who agreed to participate in the study were interviewed after the intensive phase and subsequently at the end of the treatment by a trained nurse. PASW was used to analyze the data (Predictive Analysis SoftWare, version 19.0, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.). Results: During the study period, 226 patients completed the treatment. However, complete costing data were available for 212 patients. The most highly utilized resources were chest X-ray followed by sputum smear examination. Only a smaller proportion of the patients were hospitalized. The average provider sector cost was MYR 992.34 (i.e., USD 325.35 per patient) whereby the average patient sector cost was MYR 1225.80 (i.e., USD 401.90 per patient). The average patient sector cost of our study population accounted for 5.7% of their annual family income. In multiple linear regression analysis, prolonged treatment duration (i.e., > 6 months) was the only predictor of higher provider sector costs whereby higher patient sector costs were determined by greater household income and persistent cough at the end of the intensive phase of the treatment. Conclusion: In relation to average provider sector cost, our estimates are substantially higher than the budget allocated by the Ministry of Health for the treatment of a tuberculosis case in Malaysia. The expenses borne by the patients and their families on the treatment of the current episode of tuberculosis were not catastrophic for them. ? 2014Atif et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Cost of tuberculosis treatment; Malaysia; Patient cost; Predictors of tuberculosis treatment cost; Provider cost; Resource utilization; Smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis,"adolescent; adult; aged; attitude to health; economics; female; health care personnel; health care planning; health personnel attitude; human; interview; Malaysia; male; medical audit; middle aged; prospective study; psychology; qualitative research; questionnaire; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; utilization; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Attitude to Health; Female; Health Personnel; Health Resources; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Malaysia; Male; Medical Audit; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Qualitative Research; Questionnaires; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84906967227

The purpose of this exploratory study was to assess the psycho-social impact of VI on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among nursing home residents.Methods. This cross-sectional study involved 272 residents of 60 years or older residing in seven nursing homes of the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Comprehensive ocular examinations, including near and distance vision assessment and refractions were carried out. VI was defined as visual acuity (VA) less than 6/18 in the better eye. Residents were divided into two groups: one group did not have VI (in whom VA was greater than or equal to 6/18 in the better eye), and the other had VI (in whom VA was worse than 6/18 in the better eye).Face-to-face interviews were conducted filling out a 36-item The Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form (SF-36) questionnaire. The SF-36 questionnaire was scored according to the scoring algorithm SF-36 subscales.Results: The mean age of residents was 74.68 ± 8.19 years (range, 60-99 years) and the majority were female (78.68%). The mean composite score of SF-36 was 46.98 ± 13.08. VI detrimentally affected scores of both the physical and the mental components, but the impact of VI was slightly greater for the physical component than that for the mental component. There was a trend towards a lower composite score as well as each subscale score of the SF-36 in participants with VI than in those without VI.Conclusion: VI has a negative effect on HRQoL. HRQoL is reduced among nursing home residents and the reduction in the HRQoL bears a positive association with VI. ? 2014Dev et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Kathmandu; Nursing home; Quality of life; SF-36; Visual impairment,"aged; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; female; human; interview; male; middle aged; multicenter study; Nepal; nursing home; patient; psychology; quality of life; very elderly; visual disorder; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Nepal; Nursing Homes; Quality of Life; Vision Disorders; Visually Impaired Persons",2-s2.0-84908256290

This study compared cancer mortality and incidence in New Zealand for 2000–2007 with rates in Australia, to assess if any differences had persisted or changed.Methods: The numbers of cancer deaths in New Zealand, by type of cancer, year, sex, and 5 year age group, were compared to the numbers that would have occurred if NZ rates had been the same as those in Australia. Trends over time, and also cancer incidence, were assessed.Results: From 2000–2007, there were each year an average of 586 (15.1% of the total) more deaths from cancer in New Zealand women than expected from Australian rates; and 197 (4.7%) more deaths in men. There was no significant change over time in these differentials. Higher cancer mortality was seen for most common sites; the greatest excesses were for colorectal cancer in both men and women. Cancer incidence in New Zealand women was 3.3% higher, and incidence in men was 4.7% lower, than in Australia over this period; thus the higher cancer deaths in New Zealand are not due simply to higher incidence. Over this time period, cancer mortality has fallen substantially in both countries; in New Zealand, it fell from 1990 to 2007 by 20% in women and 24% in men.Conclusion: Cancer mortality remains substantially higher in New Zealand than in Australia, especially for women, although mortality has reduced in both countries. While the differences in 2000–07 were slightly smaller than in 1996–97, there has been little change since 2000. The greater differences in deaths than in incidence suggest that patient survival is lower in New Zealand. ?NZMA.",,"aged; Article; Australia; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer survival; child; colorectal cancer; comparative study; female; human; infant; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; melanoma; New Zealand; newborn; ovary cancer; pancreas cancer; prostate cancer; stomach cancer; uterine cervix cancer; adolescent; adult; age distribution; article; Australia; incidence; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; New Zealand; preschool child; register; sex ratio; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Neoplasms; New Zealand; Registries; Sex Distribution; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84907506998

However, there is limited evidence to guide clinicians on appropriate duration of therapy. A comparison cohort study was performed to determine whether tailoring duration of inpatient intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy to patient response, assessed using a set of clinical criteria, leads to shortened hospital length of stay (LOS) without compromising patient outcomes. Patients and Methods Over a 6-month period, 47 children (aged 5-14 years) with complicated appendicitis were treated with postoperative IV antibiotics until each satisfied a set of bedside clinical parameters suggesting resolved intraperitoneal infection (core temperature < 38°C for 24 hours, tolerated two consecutive meals, mobilizing independently, requiring only oral analgesia). Complicated appendicitis was defined as the presence of generalized peritonitis, appendiceal perforation or gangrene, and/or abscess. Postoperative recovery parameters were prospectively recorded and compared with those of 47 historical control patients, matched by propensity scores, who received 5 days minimum of postoperative IV antibiotics. Sample size was determined by a priori power calculation based on reduction in LOS. Severity of postoperative complications was graded using the Clavien-Dindo system. Results Study group variables were comparable including patient demographics, duration of presenting symptoms, severity of presenting disease, preoperative antibiotics received, length of operation, seniority of primary surgeon, surgical approach taken, and intraoperative findings. The prospective cohort had a significantly shorter median LOS compared with the historical control cohort (5 vs. 6 nights, p = 0.010) while readmission rates and the incidence and severity of complications were similar, including incidence of postoperative intra-abdominal infections (6 vs. 8 cases, p = 0.562). Conclusion Using bedside clinical parameters indicative of resolved intraperitoneal infection to tailor duration of postoperative IV antibiotics for children with complicated appendicitis shortens LOS without apparent compromise to patient outcomes. ? 2014 Georg Thieme Verlag KG.",antibiotic therapy; complicated appendicitis; length of stay; postoperative complications; secondary peritonitis,"adrenalin; amoxicillin; antibiotic agent; antifungal agent; antihistaminic agent; beta 2 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; clavulanic acid; creatinine; gentamicin; metronidazole; morphine; antiinfective agent; abdominal abscess; abdominal infection; adolescent; anaphylaxis; antibiotic therapy; appendicitis; appendix perforation; Article; candidiasis; child; childhood disease; clinical article; clinical protocol; controlled study; creatinine blood level; disease severity; female; follow up; gangrene; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; incidence; length of stay; male; medication compliance; nephrotoxicity; peritonitis; postoperative care; postoperative complication; propensity score; prospective study; pruritus; surgical approach; treatment duration; treatment response; abscess; appendicitis; complication; drug administration; gangrene; Intestinal Perforation; intravenous drug administration; peritonitis; postoperative care; postoperative complication; preschool child; statistical analysis; treatment outcome; Abscess; Adolescent; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Appendicitis; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Protocols; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Gangrene; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Intestinal Perforation; Length of Stay; Male; Matched-Pair Analysis; Peritonitis; Postoperative Care; Postoperative Complications; Propensity Score; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84916211779

Evidence-based pharmaceutical management of CVD can significantly reduce mortality and morbidity for persons diagnosed with CVD or for those at intermediate or high risk of CVD. Health literacy has been identified as a major barrier in the communication and implementation of appropriate pharmaceutical management plans for CVD. Addressing health literacy is particularly relevant in Indigenous populations where there are unique health and adult literacy challenges. Methods/design. This study will examine the effect of a customized, structured CVD medication programme, delivered by health professionals, on the health literacy of Indigenous people with, or at risk, of CVD. Primary outcomes are patient's knowledge about CVD medications; secondary outcomes examine changes in health literacy skills and practices. The study will employ a multi-site pre-post design with multiple measurement points to assess intervention efficacy. Participants will be recruited from four Indigenous primary care services in Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Three educational sessions will be delivered over four weeks. A tablet application will support the education sessions and produce a customized pill card for each participant. Participants will be provided with written information about CVD medications. Medication knowledge scores, and specific health literacy skills and practices will be assessed before and after the three sessions. Statistical analyses will identify significant changes in outcomes over each session, and from the pre-session one to post-session three time points. Discussion. This study will make an important contribution to understanding the effect of a structured primary care-based intervention on CVD health literacy in Indigenous populations. The study also illustrates the incorporation of Indigenous health research principles and processes in clinical trials and provides insights that may be useful in other contexts. Trial registration.

The proposed approach consists of four main steps. The first step is to isolate the prostate from the surrounding anatomical structures based on a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of a log-likelihood function that accounts for the shape priori, the spatial interaction, and the current appearance of the prostate tissues and its background (surrounding anatomical structures). In the second step, a nonrigid registration algorithm is employed to account for any local deformation that could occur in the prostate during the scanning process due to patient breathing and local motion. In the third step, the perfusion curves that show propagation of the contrast agent into the tissue are obtained from the segmented prostate of the whole image sequence of the patient. In the final step, we collect two features from these curves and use a k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier to distinguish between malignant and benign detected tumors. Moreover, in this chapter we introduce a new approach to generate color maps that illustrate the propagation of the contrast agent in the prostate tissues based on the analysis of the 3D spatial interaction of the change of the gray-level values of prostate voxel using a generalized Gauss-Markov random field (GGMRF) image model. Finally, the tumor boundaries are determined using a level set deformable model controlled by the perfusion information and the spatial interactions between the prostate voxels. Experimental results on 30 clinical DCE-MRI data sets yield promising results. ? 2014 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

It is thought to be caused by conflict between the vestibular, visual, and other proprioceptive systems. Although nausea is the hallmark symptom, it is often preceded by stomach awareness, malaise, drowsiness, and irritability. Early self-diagnosis should be emphasized, and patients should be counseled about behavioral and pharmacologic strategies to prevent motion sickness before traveling. Patients should learn to identify situations that will lead to motion sickness and minimize the amount of unpleasant motion they are exposed to by avoiding difficult conditions while traveling or by positioning themselves in the most stable part of the vehicle. Slow, intermittent exposure to the motion can reduce symptoms. Other behavioral strategies include watching the true visual horizon, steering the vehicle, tilting their head into turns, or lying down with their eyes closed. Patients should also attempt to reduce other sources of physical, mental, and emotional discomfort.

AnPRT catalyses the Mg2+ -dependent transfer of a phosphoribosyl group from PRPP (5′-phosphoribosyl-1′-pyrophosphate) to anthranilate to form PRA (5′-phosphoribosyl anthranilate). Mtb-AnPRT was shown to catalyse a sequential reaction and significant substrate inhibition by anthranilate was observed. Antimycobacterial fluoroanthranilates and methyl-substituted analogues were shown to act as alternative substrates for Mtb-AnPRT, producing the corresponding substituted PRA products. Structures of the enzyme complexedwith anthranilate analogues reveal two distinct binding sites for anthranilate. One site is located over 8 ? (1 ? = 0.1 nm) from PRPP at the entrance to a tunnel leading to the active site, whereas in the second, inner, site anthranilate is adjacent to PRPP, in a catalytically relevant position. Soaking the analogues for variable periods of time provides evidence for anthranilate located at transient positions during transfer from the outer site to the inner catalytic site. PRPP and Mg2+ binding have been shown to be associated with the rearrangement of two flexible loops, which is required to complete the inner anthranilate-binding site. It is proposed that anthranilate first binds to the outer site, providing an unusual mechanism for substrate capture and efficient transfer to the catalytic site following the binding of PRPP. ?

They receive bilateral input from premotor (PM) and primary motor (M1) cortices. In humans, excitability of PNs can be estimated from motor-evoked potentials (MEPs) by pairing a descending volley using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to summate with an ascending volley from peripheral nerve stimulation at the C3-C4 level of the spinal cord. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) alters excitability of cortical and subcortical areas. A recent study demonstrated that cathodal tDCS can suppress facilitatory (FAC) and inhibitory (INH) components of PN excitability, presumably via effects on corticoreticulospinal neurons (Bradnam LV, Stinear CM, Lewis GN, Byblow WD. J Neurophysiol 103: 2382-2389, 2010). The present study investigated the effects of bilateral tDCS with healthy subjects. The cathode was placed over left dorsal PM or M1 and the anode over right M1 in separate sessions (PM-M1, M1-M1, or Sham). TMS of right M1 elicited MEPs in left biceps brachii across a range of TMS intensities chosen to examine PN-mediated FAC and INH. Conditioning was applied using median nerve stimulation with an interstimulus interval that coincided with TMS and peripheral volleys summating at the C3-C4 level. All participants showed FAC at TMS intensities near active motor threshold and INH at slightly higher intensities. After tDCS, FAC was reduced for M1-M1 compared with Sham but not after PM-M1 stimulation. Contrary to an earlier study with cathodal tDCS, INH was unchanged across all sessions. The difference between these and earlier findings may relate to dual- vs. single-hemisphere M1 stimulation. M1-M1 tDCS may be a useful adjuvant to techniques that aim to reduce upper limb impairment after stroke. ? 2014 the American Physiological Society.",Direct current stimulation; Electrode montage; Motor cortex; Propriospinal; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,"adult; arm; article; cerebrovascular accident; electrode; electromyography; evoked muscle response; female; human; male; median nerve; motor cortex; nerve stimulation; normal human; peripheral nerve; peripheral nerve stimulator; premotor cortex; priority journal; task performance; transcranial direct current stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation; transcranial magnetic stimulation system; cervical spinal cord; controlled study; long term potentiation; middle aged; nerve cell inhibition; physiology; procedures; proprioception; randomized controlled trial; transcranial direct current stimulation; Adult; Cervical Cord; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Humans; Long-Term Potentiation; Male; Middle Aged; Neural Inhibition; Proprioception; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation",2-s2.0-84901706577

Drawing on critical social theories of the production, circulation, and consumption of popular music, the book gathers together diverse insights from geographers and musicologists. Popular music has become increasingly embedded in complex and often contradictory discourses of wellbeing. For instance, some new genres and sub-cultures of popular music are associated with violence, drug-use, and the angst of living yet simultaneously define the hopes and dreams of millions of young people. At a service level, popular music is increasingly used as a therapeutic modality in holistic medicine, as well as in conventional health care and public health practice. The genre of popular music, then, is fundamental to human wellbeing as an active and central part of people's emotional lives. By conceptually and empirically foregrounding place, this book demonstrates how music whether from particular places, about particular places, or played in particular places is a crucial component of health and wellbeing. ?

We hypothesized that gap junctions are important mediators in tissue dysfunction and injury processes in the retina, and therefore, we investigated the pattern of connexin protein expression in the light-damaged albino rat eye. Methods: Adult Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to intense light for 24 h. The animals were euthanized, and ocular tissue was harvested at 0 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 7 days after light damage. The tissues were processed for immunohistochemistry and western blotting to analyze the expression of the gap junction proteins in the light-damaged condition compared to the non-light-damaged condition. Cell death was detected using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) technique. Results: Intense light exposure caused increased TUNEL labeling of photoreceptor cells. Immunocytochemistry revealed that connexin 36 (Cx36) was significantly increased in the inner plexiform layer and Cx45 was significantly decreased in the light-damaged retina. The pattern of Cx36 and Cx45 labeling returned to normal 7 days after light damage. Cx43 significantly increased in the RPE and the choroid in the light-damaged tissue, and decreased but not significantly in the retina. This elevated Cx43 expression in the choroid colocalized with markers of nitration-related oxidative stress (nitrotyrosine) and inflammation (CD45 and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule-1) in the choroid. Conclusions: The results suggest that connexins are regulated differently in the retina than in the choroid in response to photoreceptor damage. Changes in connexins, including Cx36, Cx43, and Cx45, may contribute to the damage process. Specifically, Cx43 was associated with inflammatory damage. Therefore, connexins may be candidate targets for treatment for ameliorating disease progression. ? 2014 Molecular Vision.",,"3 nitrotyrosine; calcium binding protein; calcium ion; connexin 36; connexin 45; gap junction protein; ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; astrocyte; cell count; cell death; cell labeling; cell loss; female; immunocytochemistry; immunoreactivity; light damage; macrophage; male; nick end labeling; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathogenesis; photoreceptor cell; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; rat; retina injury; retina inner plexiform layer; smooth muscle fiber; upregulation; Western blotting; Animals; Blotting, Western; Cell Death; Connexin 43; Connexins; Eye; Female; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Light; Macrophages; Male; Photoreceptor Cells, Vertebrate; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Tyrosine",2-s2.0-84901426562

Potentially modifiable risk factors for late stillbirths are maternal age, obesity and smoking, but the population attributable risk associated with these risk factors is small.Recently the Auckland Stillbirth Study reported that maternal sleep position was associated with late stillbirth. Women who did not sleep on their left side on the night before the death of the baby had double the risk compared with sleeping on other positions. The population attributable risk was 37%. This novel observation needs to be replicated or refuted.Methods/Design: Case control study of late singleton stillbirths without congenital abnormality. Controls are women with an ongoing singleton pregnancy, who are randomly selected from participating maternity units booking list of pregnant women, they are allocated a gestation for interview based on the distribution of gestations of stillbirths from the previous 4?years for the unit. The number of controls selected is proportional to the number of stillbirths that occurred at the hospital over the previous 4?years.Data collection: Interviewer administered questionnaire and data extracted from medical records. Sample size: 415 cases and 830 controls. This takes into account a 30% non-participation rate, and will detect an OR of 1.5 with a significance level of 0.05 and power of 80% for variables with a prevalence of 57%, such as non-left sleeping position.Statistical analysis: Mantel-Haenszel odds ratios and unconditional logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders.Discussion: The hypotheses to be tested here are important, biologically plausible and amenable to a public health intervention. Although this case-control study cannot prove causation, there is a striking parallel with research relating to sudden infant death syndrome, where case-control studies identified prone sleeping position as a major modifiable risk factor. Subsequently mothers were advised to sleep babies prone ("" Back to Sleep"" campaign), which resulted in a dramatic drop in SIDS. This study will provide robust evidence to help determine whether such a public health intervention should be considered.Trial registration number: NCT02025530. ? 2014 Platts et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Fetal growth restriction; Perinatal death; Perinatal mortality; Reduced fetal movements; Risk factors; Sleep position; Stillbirth,article; case control study; clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; medical record; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prevalence; questionnaire; risk factor; sleep time; stillbirth; body posture; epidemiology; methodology; physiology; sleep; stillbirth; United Kingdom; Case-Control Studies; England; Female; Humans; Posture; Pregnancy; Questionnaires; Research Design; Risk Factors; Sleep; Stillbirth,2-s2.0-84901426735

The initiative utilizes a vertical, spiral approach during the clinically focused years of the Cambridge undergraduate and graduate medical degrees. It is facilitated by the Nutrition Education Review Group, a group associated with the UK Need for Nutrition Education/Innovation Programme, and informed by the experiences of their previous nutrition education interventions. Three factors were identified as contributing to the success of the nutrition education initiative including the leadership and advocacy skills of the nutrition academic team, the variety of teaching modes, and the multidisciplinary approach to teaching. Opportunities for continuing improvement to the medical nutrition education initiative included a review of evaluation tools, inclusion of nutrition in assessment items, and further alignment of the Cambridge curriculum with the recommended UK medical nutrition education curriculum.

Spontaneous behaviour was observed through video recordings of home pens and test-related behaviours were recorded during tests involving animalhuman contact and reaction towards a novel object. We showed that the minipigs fed a high fat/cholesterol, low carbohydrate diet were less aggressive, showed more non-agonistic social contact and had fewer and less severe skin lesions and were less fearful of a novel object than minipigs fed low fat, high carbohydrate diets. These results found in a porcine model could have important implications for general health and wellbeing of humans and show the potential for using dietary manipulations to reduce aggression in human society. ? 2014 Haagensen et al.",,"aggression; animal behavior; animal experiment; article; carbohydrate diet; cholesterol diet; controlled study; fear; Gottingen minipig; lipid diet; low carbohydrate diet; low fat diet; male; nonhuman; skin defect; social behavior; videorecording; animal; heart rate; minipig; motivation; physiology; swine; Aggression; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Diet, Carbohydrate-Restricted; Diet, High-Fat; Fear; Handling (Psychology); Heart Rate; Male; Swine; Swine, Miniature",2-s2.0-84899666786

An additional mechanism proposed for the putative cardio-protective effect is enhanced efficiency of metabolic energy usage by the heart. We tested whether dietary supplementation of fish oil enhances cardiac efficiency or otherwise improves mechano-energetic performance. Experiments were performed at two distinct physiological levels (whole organ and isolated tissues) employing two independent metabolic indices (oxygen consumption and heat production), respectively. Feeding rats with either a fish oil-enriched or a saturated fatty acid-enriched diet did not alter the efficiency of either the isolated whole heart or its left ventricular trabeculae. Numerous epidemiological studies, supported by clinical and experimental findings, have suggested beneficial effects of dietary fish or fish oil supplementation on cardiovascular health. One such experimental study showed a profound (100%) increase in myocardial efficiency (i.e. the ratio of work output to metabolic energy input) of the isolated whole heart, achieved by a corresponding decrease in the rate of myocardial oxygen consumption. However, a number of other investigations have returned null results on the latter energetic index. Such conflicting findings have motivated us to undertake a re-examination. To that effect, we investigated the effects of dietary fatty acid supplementation on myocardial mechano-energetics, with our primary focus on cardiac efficiency. We used both isolated hearts and isolated left ventricular trabeculae of rats fed with one of three distinct diets: reference (REF), fish oil-supplemented (FO) or saturated fat-supplemented (SFA). For all three groups, and at both spatial levels, we supplied 10 mm glucose as the exogenous metabolic substrate. In the working heart experiments, we found no difference in the average mechanical efficiency among the three dietary groups: 14.8 ± 1.1% (REF), 13.9 ± 0.6% (FO) and 13.6 ± 0.7% (SFA). Likewise, we observed no difference in peak mechanical efficiency of left ventricular trabeculae among the REF, FO and SFA groups: 13.3 ± 1.4, 11.2 ± 2.2 and 12.5 ± 1.5%, respectively. We conclude that there is no effect of a period of pre-exposure to a diet supplemented with either fish oil or saturated fatty acids on the efficiency of the myocardium at either spatial level: tissue or whole heart. ? 2014 The Physiological Society.",,"fish oil; glucose; oxygen; saturated fatty acid; fat intake; fish oil; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; controlled study; diet supplementation; fat intake; heart left ventricle; heart muscle oxygen consumption; heart weight; heart work; isolated heart; male; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; thermogenesis; administration and dosage; animal; diet supplementation; drug effects; heart ventricle; heart ventricle function; pharmacology; Wistar rat; Animals; Dietary Fats; Dietary Supplements; Fish Oils; Heart Ventricles; Male; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Ventricular Function",2-s2.0-84898545561

Statistical redistribution of the UCD has been used to examine the effect of misclassification of the UCD attributed to heart failure, but sex- and race-specific redistribution of deaths on coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality in the United States has not been examined.Methods: We used coarsened exact matching to infer the UCD of vital records with heart failure as the UCD from 1999 to 2010 for decedents 55 years old and older from states encompassing regions under surveillance by the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study (Maryland, Minnesota, Mississippi, and North Carolina). Records with heart failure as the UCD were matched on decedent characteristics (five-year age groups, sex, race, education, year of death, and state) to records with heart failure listed among the multiple causes of death. Each heart failure death was then redistributed to plausible UCDs proportional to the frequency among matched records.Results: After redistribution the proportion of deaths increased for CHD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, hypertensive heart disease, and cardiomyopathy, P < 0.001. The percent increase in CHD mortality after redistribution was the highest in Mississippi (12%) and lowest in Maryland (1.6%), with variations by year, race, and sex. Redistribution proportions for CHD were similar to CHD death classification by a panel of expert reviewers in the ARIC study.Conclusions: Redistribution of ill-defined UCD would improve the accuracy and comparability of mortality statistics used to allocate public health resources and monitor mortality trends. ? 2014 Snyder et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Cause of death; Coronary heart disease; Death certificates; Heart failure; Ill-defined causes of death; Mortality; Vital statistics,cardiovascular disease; cause of death; health risk; mortality; statistical analysis; adult; African American; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; cardiomyopathy; cause of death; cerebrovascular disease; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; dementia; diabetes mellitus; education; female; gastrointestinal disease; gender; groups by age; heart failure; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; kidney disease; lower respiratory tract infection; major clinical study; male; medical record; medical research; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; priority journal; race; Redistribution; statistical parameters; trend study; United States; very elderly; United States,2-s2.0-84898888397

Zoonotic transmission dynamics combined with diagnostic challenges lead to difficulties in prevention and identification of cases. The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) lacks surveillance data for human leptospirosis. This hospital-based serologic survey sought to estimate the burden of leptospirosis, collect information relating to associated factors, and assess the leptospirosis point-of-care rapid diagnostic test (RDT) commonly used in FSM.Methods: A four-month hospital-based survey was conducted in Pohnpei State, FSM in 2011. Patients with undifferentiated fevers presenting to hospital were referred for enrolment by physicians. Consenting participants provided paired blood specimens 10-30 days apart, and responded to interview questions regarding demographics, clinical symptoms, exposure to animals, and environmental exposure. Blood samples were subjected to immunochromatographic RDT and confirmed by microscopic agglutination test (MAT).Results: Of 54 participants tested by MAT, 20.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 10.1-30.6%) showed serologic evidence of acute infection. Occupation student (odds ratio [OR], 17.5; 95% CI: 1.9-161.1) and recreational gardening (OR, 8.6; 95% CI: 1.0-73.8), identified by univariate logistic regression, were associated with infection. The local rapid diagnostic test (RDT) performed with a sensitivity of 69.2 (42.3-89.3 CI) and specificity of 90.0 (81.6-95.6 CI) compared to MAT.Conclusions: This study demonstrated a high burden of leptospirosis in Pohnpei.

However, certain groups within populations have markedly different risk profiles for obesity and related health behaviours. Well-designed subgroup analysis can identify potential differential effects of obesity interventions, which may be important for reducing health inequalities. The study aim was to evaluate the consistency of the effects of active video games across important subgroups in a randomised controlled trial (RCT).Findings: A two-arm, parallel RCT was conducted in overweight or obese children (n = 322; aged 10-14 years) to determine the effect of active video games on body composition. Statistically significant overall treatment effects favouring the intervention group were found for body mass index, body mass index z-score and percentage body fat at 24 weeks. For these outcomes, pre-specified subgroup analyses were conducted among important baseline demographic (ethnicity, sex) and prognostic (cardiovascular fitness) groups. No statistically significant interaction effects were found between the treatment and subgroup terms in the main regression model (p = 0.36 to 0.93), indicating a consistent treatment effect across these groups.Conclusions: Preliminary evidence suggests an active video games intervention had a consistent positive effect on body composition among important subgroups. This may support the use of these games as a pragmatic public health intervention to displace sedentary behaviour with physical activity in young people. ? 2014 Foley et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Active video games; Overweight and obesity; Subgroup analysis,adolescent; article; body composition; body fat; body mass; cardiovascular effect; child; childhood obesity; ethnic difference; female; human; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); recreation; scoring system; sex difference; sitting; Adolescent; Body Composition; Body Mass Index; Child; Female; Humans; Intervention Studies; Male; Motor Activity; Overweight; Pediatric Obesity; Regression Analysis; Sedentary Lifestyle; Sex Factors; Video Games,2-s2.0-84897959841

A total sample of 17 junior doctors in their first year of training volunteered for this study. Over four time periods separated by 6?week phases, the doctors completed a set of quality of life and psychosocial inventories and wore a Polar RS800 Heart Rate Monitor over a day and night time interval. The findings showed that this sample of doctors did not report any problems associated with depression, anxiety, stress, burnout or quality of life (psychosocial measures). In addition, their heart rate variability scores (physiological measures) did not show any significant fluctuations. Furthermore, the responses from the self-report instruments measuring stress, anxiety, depression, quality of life and burnout did not consistently correlate with the HRV information suggesting a mind–body disconnection. More work needs to be done on larger samples to investigate these findings further given that the literature shows that junior doctors are likely to be stressed and working in stress-provoking environments. ? 2013, The Author(s).",Doctors; Heart rate variability; Mental health,,2-s2.0-84992196719

In Mtb, two distinct enzymes perform the conversion of proline into glutamate: the first step is the oxidation of proline into Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic acid (P5C) by the flavoenzyme proline dehydrogenase (PruB), and the second reaction involves converting the tautomeric form of P5C (glutamate-γ-semialdehyde) into glutamate using the NAD+-dependent Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylic dehydrogenase (PruA). Here, the three-dimensional structures of Mtb-PruA, determined by X-ray crystallography, in the apo state and in complex with NAD+ are described at 2.5 and 2.1 ? resolution, respectively. The structure reveals a conserved NAD+-binding mode, common to other related enzymes. Species-specific conformational differences in the active site, however, linked to changes in the dimer interface, suggest possibilities for selective inhibition of Mtb-PruA despite its reasonably high sequence identity to other PruA enzymes. Using recombinant PruA and PruB, the proline-utilization pathway in Mtb has also been reconstituted in vitro. Functional validation using a novel NMR approach has demonstrated that the PruA and PruB enzymes are together sufficient to convert proline to glutamate, the first such demonstration for monofunctional proline-utilization enzymes. ? 2014 International Union of Crystallography.",crystal disorder; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; proline utilization; PruA,"nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; proline; pyrroline 5 carboxylate dehydrogenase; chemical structure; chemistry; enzymology; metabolism; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nuclear magnetic resonance; protein quaternary structure; protein tertiary structure; structural homology; X ray crystallography; 1-Pyrroline-5-Carboxylate Dehydrogenase; Crystallography, X-Ray; Models, Molecular; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; NAD; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Proline; Protein Structure, Quaternary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Structural Homology, Protein",2-s2.0-84898727266

Despite this, smoke-free policies and systems for supporting cessation have proved difficult to introduce in mental health and drug and alcohol services (MHDAS). This paper examines the barriers to becoming smoke free within New Zealand services. Key informants, including staff, smoke-free coordinators, and cessation specialists were interviewed. Of the 142 invited informants 61 agreed (42%) to participate in a telephone interview, and 56 provided useable data. Organizations had a permissive or transitioning smoking culture, or were smoke free, defined by smoke-free environments, smoke-free-promoting attitudes and behaviours of management and staff, and cessation support. Most organizations were on a continuum between permissive and transitional cultures. Only eight services had a fully smoke-free culture. MHDAS face many challenges in the transition to a smoke-free culture. They are not helped by exemptions in smoke-free policies for mental health services, staff smoking, negative staff attitudes to becoming smoke free, poor knowledge of nicotine dependence, smoking-related harm and comorbidities, and poor knowledge and skills regarding cessation-support options.

Identifying the cells that participate in the regeneration process as well as the molecular mechanisms involved may reveal therapeutic targets for the treatment of kidney disease. Renal regeneration is associated with the expression of genetic pathways that are necessary for kidney organogenesis, suggesting that the regenerating tubular epithelium may be ""reprogrammed"" to a less-differentiated, progenitor state. This review will highlight data from various vertebrate models supporting the hypothesis that nephrogenic genes are reactivated as part of the process of kidney regeneration following acute kidney injury (AKI).

Critical to this function is the physical arrangement of the glomerular blood filter attached to a tubular epithelium that is subdivided into specialized proximal and distal segments. During embryogenesis, nephron progenitors undergo a mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) and adopt different segment-specific cell fates along the proximo-distal axis of the nephron. The molecular basis of how these segments arise remains largely unknown. Recent studies using the zebrafish have identified the Hnf1beta transcription factor (Hnf1b) as a major regulator of tubular segmentation. In Hnf1b-deficient zebrafish embryos, nephron progenitors fail to adopt the proximo-distal segmentation pattern of the nephron, yet still undergo MET. This observation suggests that the functional segmentation of renal tubular epithelial cells is independent of pathways that induce their epithelialization.

Methods: This was a retrospective audit of DCI cases requiring recompression in Auckland between 01 January 1996 and 31 December 2012. Data describing patient demographics, dive characteristics, presentation of DCI and outcomes were extracted from case notes and facility databases. Trends in annual case numbers were evaluated using Spearman's correlation coefficients (ρ) and compared with trends in entry-level diver certifications. Trends in patient demographics and delay between diving and recompression were evaluated using regression analyses. Results: There were 520 DCI cases. Annual caseload decreased over the study period (ρ = 0.813, P < 0.0001) as did entrylevel diving certifications in New Zealand (ρ = 0.962, P < 0.0001). Mean diver age was 33.6 (95% confidence limits (CI) 32.7 to 34.5) years and age increased (P < 0.0001) over the study period.

Conclusions: Numbers of DCI cases recompressed in Auckland have declined significantly over the last 17 years. The most plausible explanation is declining diving activity but improvements in diving safety cannot be excluded.

This is unfortunate, as these models contain useful information to develop further research and to support decision-making policies. In the absence of a major study on Eurasian badger (Meles meles) abundance in Atlantic Spain, and given the potential role of this species in Mycobacterium bovis epidemiology, we aimed to predict broad-scale badger abundance by generalizing published models for sett suitability within the UK (one calibrated for Northern Ireland and another one for England and Wales). The UK models used fine-resolution environmental predictors that were not available for Spain. Thus, we generalized the models using the outputs of the published models as response variables and calibrated new models using broad-scale environmental predictors. The new model derived from that for Northern Ireland accurately predicted the badger abundance (field data for 48 1km×1km squares in 12 localities) in Atlantic Spain, and indicated a high potential for the species in lowland pastoral areas. The mean density of badgers in the study area was 3.81adults/km2 (3.0±1.3adults/group), which is higher than in Mediterranean areas in Spain, but lower than in some areas in England where badgers contribute to M. bovis maintenance. We provide the first example of generalization of published spatial models, and confirm that this procedure allows for more efficient use of research funding, by generating new information of relevance, in this case study, for badger management and for understanding M. bovis epidemiology in Atlantic Spain. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Bovine tuberculosis; Ecological modelling; Landscape ecology; Meles meles; Model generalization; Population abundance,Bovine tuberculosis; Ecological modelling; Landscape ecology; Meles meles; Model generalization; Population abundance; Diseases; Ecology; Publishing; Research; abundance; accuracy assessment; bacterium; calibration; conservation management; decision making; ecological modeling; epidemiology; landscape ecology; mustelid; pastoralism; Atlantic Coast [Europe]; Atlantic Coast [Spain]; England; Ireland; Spain; United Kingdom; Wales,2-s2.0-84891639733

The aim of this study was to document current patterns of corticosteroid prescribing in New Zealand palliative care settings and to reflect on whether they were in line with international experience. Methods. A retrospective review of inpatient use of corticosteroids was undertaken in a sample of six New Zealand hospices. Data were collected on numbers of patients prescribed corticosteroids, indications for use, choice of agent, doses and dosage changes, duration of course, incidence of adverse effects, method of stopping, use of guidelines, and processes for monitoring and review. Results: The case notes of 1179 inpatients were reviewed and 768 patients (65.1%) had received at least one course of corticosteroids. There was a marked consistency in the proportion of patients prescribed corticosteroids among the sample hospices (61-69%). Detailed information was recorded for a sample of 260 patients. Corticosteroids were prescribed most commonly for non-specific reasons (40.4% of prescribing events), followed by neurological (25.3%) and soft tissue infiltration symptoms (14.4%). The agent of choice was dexamethasone with a dose range of 1 mg to 40 mg and a median dose of 8 mg. The median course duration for all corticosteroid prescribing events was 29 days. Abrupt stopping occurred in 72 (23.2%) cases, of these 35 (49%) had been on a course of corticosteroids for more than three weeks. Guidelines were only available in one hospice. Monitoring and review was documented in 135 (52%) of cases, and adverse effects were recorded in 82 (32%); these are likely to be underestimates due to a high level of non-recording. Conclusions: This New Zealand study showed that corticosteroids are widely prescribed in palliative care, most commonly for non-specific indications. These findings are consistent with the international literature in this area and this large, multi-site study adds weight to the findings and the need for ongoing discussion about the place of these drugs in palliative care. ? 2014 Denton and Shaw; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Corticosteroids; Evidence-based medicine; Guidelines; Hospices; Palliative care; Prescribing,corticosteroid; dexamethasone; methylprednisolone; omeprazole; phenytoin; prednisone; zopiclone; adult; age; aged; article; cancer diagnosis; corticosteroid therapy; drug indication; drug monitoring; drug withdrawal; female; gender; general practitioner; hospice care; hospital patient; hospital physician; human; inflammation; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; palliative therapy; practice guideline; prescription; retrospective study; soft tissue disease; swallowing; tenesmus; treatment duration; treatment withdrawal; unspecified side effect,2-s2.0-84898048400

Counties Manukau District Health Board (CMDHB) has the highest Maori and Pacific population of any New Zealand District Health Board. A CMDHB study found that a high proportion of patients with gout were also at increased risk of cardiovascular disease. ASSESSMENT OF PROBLEMS: The primary objective was to examine whether the control of gout had changed over time at one clinic. The secondary objective was to assess the management of cardiovascular risk factors in patients with gout at that clinic. RESULTS: The mean serum uric acid level of patients with gout in the practice had risen in comparison with a similar audit carried out in March 2009. This indicates that the control of gout for patients at the practice has worsened over time. Many patients had not had an annual serum uric acid test. STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVEMENT: A repeat uric acid level was scheduled for all patients with gout in the practice, with follow-up appointments to be arranged if the result was abnormal. LESSONS: Gout is often suboptimally managed. Serum uric acid levels may only be tested when a patient presents with an acute attack of gout. Consideration should be given to a minimum of annual serum uric acid levels.

The Board of the Pacific Rim College of Psychiatrists identified experts in forensic psychiatry from Australia, Canada, China, Hong Kong, Japan, Russia, Singapore, Taiwan, and the US. Each contributor provided an account of issues in their jurisdiction, including mental health services to mentally disordered offenders in prison, competence or fitness to stand trial, legal insanity as a defense at trial, diminished responsibility, and special forensic services available, including forensic hospitals and community forensic mental health services. Responses have been collated and are presented topic by topic and country by country within the body of this review. The availability of mental health screening and psychiatric in-reach or forensic liaison services within prisons differed considerably between countries, as did provisioning of community forensic mental health and rehabilitation services. Diversion of mentally disordered offenders to forensic, state, or hybrid hospitals was common. Legal constructs of criminal responsibility (insanity defense) and fitness to stand trial (""disability"") are almost universally recognized, although variably used. Disparities between unmet needs and resourcing available were common themes. The legislative differences between contributing countries with respect to the mental health law and criminal law relating to mentally disordered offenders are relatively subtle. The major differences lie in operationalizing and resourcing forensic services. ? 2013 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Forensic psychiatry; Insanity defense; Pacific Rim,forensic psychiatry; insanity defense; Pacific Rim; Asia; Australasia; Criminals; Forensic Psychiatry; Humans; Insanity Defense; Mental Competency; Mental Disorders; Mental Health Services; Needs Assessment; North America; Prisoners; Russia,2-s2.0-84894335004

The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of VI and blindness and to explore the association between severity of VI and vision-specific QoL among older people living in nursing homes of Kathmandu, Nepal. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 158 residents aged 60 years or older residing in seven nursing homes of Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. Near acuity, presenting and the best corrected distance visual acuity (VA) were assessed in each eye and considered in the better eye after adequate refraction. A complete anterior and posterior segment examination was carried out. Face-to-face interviews were conducted using a 57-item Nursing Home Vision-Targeted Health-Related Quality of Life (NHVQoL) questionnaire. Results: The mean age of residents was 75.60 ± 7.12 years and the majority were female (66.46%). The prevalence of VI and blindness was 45.57% and its leading cause was cataract, which was followed by age-related macular degeneration, corneal opacity, glaucoma and macular scar. The mean composite score of NHVQoL questionnaire was 52.22 ± 12.49. There was a consistent overall deterioration in the mean composite score as well as each subscale score of NHVQoL questionnaire with a worsening of VA. Conclusion: VI and blindness are highly prevalent among older people living in nursing homes. VI has a significant negative impact on vision-specific QoL.

Various models have been proposed to infer details of the dynamics that describe epidemic progression. These include inference approaches derived from Kingman’s coalescent theory. Here, we use recently described coalescent theory for epidemic dynamics to develop stochastic and deterministic coalescent susceptible–infected–removed (SIR) tree priors. We implement these in a Bayesian phylogenetic inference framework to permit joint estimation of SIR epidemic parameters and the sample genealogy. We assess the performance of the two coalescent models and alsojuxtaposeresultsobtained with a recently published birth– death-sampling model for epidemic inference. Comparisons are made by analyzing sets of genealogies simulated under precisely known epidemiological parameters. Additionally, we analyze influenza A (H1N1) sequence data sampled in the Canterbury region of New Zealand and HIV-1 sequence data obtained from known United Kingdom infection clusters. We show that both coalescent SIR models are effective at estimating epidemiological parameters from data with large fundamental reproductive number R0and large population size S0: Furthermore, we find that the stochastic variant generally outperforms its deterministic counterpart in terms of error, bias, and highest posterior density coverage, particularly for smaller R0and S0: However, each of these inference models is shown to have undesirable properties in certain circumstances, especially for epidemic outbreaks with R0close to one or with small effective susceptible populations. ? 2015, Genetics Society of America.

Little is known about the acceptability of computerized therapy programs for rural Australians and the suitability of computerized programs developed in one cultural context when used in another country. Issues such as accents and local differences in health care access might mean adjustments to programs are required. Objective: This study sought to explore the acceptability of SPARX by youth in rural Australia and to explore whether and how young people would wish to access such a program. Methods: Focus groups and semistructured interviews were conducted with 16 young people attending two youth-focused community services in a small, rural Tasmanian town. An inductive data-driven approach was used to identify themes using the interview transcripts as the primary data source. Interpretation was supported by demographic data, observer notes, and content analysis. Results: Participants reported that young people want help for mental health issues but they have an even stronger need for controlling how they access services. In particular, they considered protecting their privacy in their small community to be paramount. Participants thought computerized therapy was a promising way to increase access to treatment for youth in rural and remote areas if offered with or without therapist support and via settings other than school. The design features of SPARX that were perceived to be useful, included the narrative structure of the program, the use of different characters, the personalization of an avatar, ""socialization"" with the Guide character, optional journaling, and the use of encouraging feedback. Participants did not consider (New Zealand) accents off-putting. Young people believed the SPARX program would appeal to those who play computer games generally, but may be less appealing for those who do not. Conclusions: The findings suggest that computerized therapy offered in ways that support privacy and choice can improve access to treatment for rural youth. Foreign accents and style may not be off-putting to teenage users when the program uses a playful fantasy genre, as it is consistent with their expectation of fantasy worlds, and it is in a medium with which they already have a level of competence. Rather, issues of engaging design and confidential access appeared to be more important. These findings suggest a proven tool once formally assessed at a local level can be adopted cross-nationally.",Computer games; Computerized CBT; Mental health; Rural health; Stigma; Youth,,2-s2.0-84897596712

We used Coroner records in exploring the ecological factors associated with these deaths and the personal characteristics of persons who jumped to their death (hereafter, ""jumping suicides""). We compared suicides by jumping with all other suicides and examined the suicides that occurred at ten different jumping sites. Methods: The Coroner's files of all suicides in Hong Kong from 2002 to 2007 included 6,125 documented deaths. Results: 2,964 (48.4 %) involved jumping during the study period. Eighty-three percent (83 %) of suicide jumps occurred in residential buildings, and of these, 61% occurred from the decedent's own home. Jumping suicides differed from non-jumping suicides in terms of their socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., for male: 60.8 vs. 67.3 % of jumping suicide and non-jumping suicides, p < 0.0001) and the presence of physical illness (44.4 vs. 42.7 % for jumping and non-jumping suicides, p < 0.0001). While statistically significant, these differences are relatively modest. In contrast, 40.7 documented illnesses vs. 23.1 % for jumping and non-jumping suicides (p < 0.0001). Conclusions: Means restriction is a key strategy for suicide prevention. Installation of physical barriers, one of the mean restriction strategies, at common places for suicide has strong evidence to avert suicides without substitution effects. There seems to be challenges to implement physical barriers to prevent residential jumping suicides. Simply applying physical barriers to preclude jumping in Hong Kong appears to be difficult given its ubiquitous ""high-rise"" residential dwellings. Hence, we also need to develop alternative strategies aimed at preventing people from becoming suicidal. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Access to suicide means; Case record study; Coroner court file; Hong Kong; Jumping; Residential suicides; Suicide; Suicides by jumping,adult; altitude; cause of death; coroner; epidemiology; female; Hong Kong; human; male; middle aged; psychology; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; suicide; Adult; Altitude; Cause of Death; Coroners and Medical Examiners; Female; Hong Kong; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Socioeconomic Factors; Suicide,2-s2.0-84896736991

This article summarizes the recent studies which describe the efficacy of treating biofilms in chronic rhinosinusitis. RECENT FINDINGS: Biofilms are polymicrobial communities comprised of bacteria that tend to be more antibiotic-resistant than when in planktonic forms. Antibiotic therapy against biofilms is usually associated with relapse following cessation of treatment and may also have an adverse effect on normal commensal microflora. Surfactants can improve clinical symptoms, but their use has been limited by side effects.

Removal of the generator and the intracardiac components occurs at time of transplantation but removal of the intravascular portion of leads may be unsuccessful without specialized extraction equipment. Methods We performed a retrospective audit of chest radiographs and clinical records of patients undergoing OHT at Green Lane and Auckland City Hospitals between 2002 and 2012. Results At the time of transplant surgery, 56 of 100 patients had a CIED in situ. Hardware was retained postoperatively in 22 (39%), and the CIED had been in situ for 47 (interquartile range [IQR] 16-68) months for these cases, compared to 14 (IQR 3-24) months in those without. In two (9%) patients, the device generator was electively explanted during the week following OHT. There were no subsequent procedures undertaken to remove retained lead fragments. One (4%) had lead fragment embolization, one (4%) had endoluminal fragment migration, and one (4%) had lead fragment erosion into the mediastinum; all were asymptomatic and without adverse clinical sequelae. There was no infection associated with this hardware. The presence of retained lead fragments was not associated with additional mortality. Conclusions Retained lead fragments following OHT occur commonly, without adverse clinical events for this cohort; however, the long-term clinical implications remain uncertain. Complete removal of all CIED hardware should be attempted at the time of OHT, and when this is not possible leads should be left in a state that facilitates their removal at a later date if required. ?2014, The Authors.

Methods and design: A total of 90,631 people aged 30-80 years were followed for up to 3 years after a formal CVD risk assessment was undertaken between January 2006 and October 2009, during routine primary care visits in New Zealand. Patients either had prior CVD or had their CVD risk estimated using a modified Framingham prediction equation for fatal or non-fatal CVD events. The individual risk profiles were anonymously linked to national dispensing data for blood-pressure-lowering and lipid-lowering medications in the 6-month period before and in consecutive 6-month blocks after the baseline CVD risk assessment. Results: At baseline, a combination of blood-pressure-lowering and lipid-lowering therapy was already being used by about two-thirds of patients with prior CVD, one-quarter with a 5-year CVD risk greater than 10% (approximately 20% 10-year risk), and one-tenth with CVD risk below this level. Among these previously treated patients, dispensing rates for blood-pressure-lowering, lipid-lowering, or both medications together declined by only 4-16% up to 3 years after baseline assessment, irrespective of risk category. Among patients untreated at baseline, combination therapy was initiated within 6 months for 21% with prior CVD, 16% with 5-year CVD risk greater than 15% (approximately 30% 10-year risk and the national drug-treatment threshold), 10% with 5-year CVD risk between 10 and 14% (approximately 20-29% 10-year risk), and 3% in the lowest risk category. Across the study population, patients with prior CVD had the highest dispensing rates for each category of medication, and incrementally higher dispensing rates were noted as CVD risk group increased. Conclusions: In this primary care cohort, most patients already using CVD medications at the time of the baseline CVD risk assessment maintained treatment over a maximum of 3 years follow up, irrespective of their estimated baseline risk. Among patients untreated at baseline, subsequent dispensing rates were strongly related to estimated CVD risk group. Around 15-20% of untreated patients meeting national drug-treatment criteria commenced combination pharmacotherapy within 6 months of CVD risk assessment. ?

In fact, up to 50% of COPD could be attributable to other causes. Relatively little is known about COPD among nonsmokers, and this group is usually excluded from studies of COPD. Methods: In this cross-sectional case-comparison study, smokers and nonsmokers aged over 45 with COPD (post-bronchodilator FEV1 ? 70% predicted, FEV1/FVC ratio &lt; 0.7) were recruited from specialist outpatient clinics and from primary care. Subjects completed a questionnaire and interview, and underwent spirometry, venesection, exhaled nitric oxide (ENO) measurement, allergen skinprick testing, formal lung function testing and high resolution CT. Results: 48 nonsmokers and 45 smokers participated. Asthma was nearly universal among nonsmokers and was the commonest identifiable cause of COPD in that group. Nonsmokers also exhibited a high prevalence of objective eosinophilic inflammation (raised ENO and eosinophil counts, positive skinprick tests). Smokers had more severe airflow obstruction, but respiratory symptom prevalences were similar between groups. Nonsmokers reported greater lifetime burdens of respiratory disease. Nonsmokers' HRCT results showed functional small airways disease, with no significant emphysema in any subject. Previously undiagnosed bronchiectasis was common in both groups (31% and 42%). Conclusions: Asthma is a very common cause of COPD among nonsmokers.

These tend to be costly and time consuming and often fail to achieve adequate blood pressure (BP) control. The TRIUMPH study aims to investigate the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and acceptability of early use of a 3-in-1 BP-lowering pill (""Triple Pill"") compared with usual care for the management of hypertension. Methods The prospective, open, randomized controlled clinical trial (n = 700) will compare Triple Pill-based strategy to usual care among individuals with persistent mild-to-moderate hypertension (systolic BP >140 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >90 mm Hg, or systolic BP >130 mm Hg and/or diastolic BP >80 mm Hg in patients with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) on no or minimal drug therapy. The study will be conducted within approximately 20 hospital-based clinics in India. Participants will be randomized to the Triple Pill (initially strength 1 - telmisartan 20 mg, amlodipine 2.5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 6.25 mg, with the option of subsequent titration to strength 2 - telmisartan 40 mg, amlodipine 5 mg, hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg) or continued usual care. Participants will be followed up for 6 months. The primary outcome is the proportion of participants achieving target BP at the end follow-up. Conclusion This study will determine whether early use of a low-dose triple combination therapy has the potential to address some of the challenges in hypertension control through earlier achievement of BP control, better adherence, and fewer adverse effects, in the context of less intensive clinical follow-up. ? 2014 Mosby, Inc.",,"amlodipine; hydrochlorothiazide; telmisartan; adult; article; blood pressure regulation; chronic kidney disease; clinical effectiveness; clinical protocol; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug withdrawal; follow up; human; hypertension; low drug dose; major clinical study; multicenter study; pill; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; systolic blood pressure; treatment duration; treatment outcome; unspecified side effect; young adult; Adult; Amlodipine; Angiotensin II Type 1 Receptor Blockers; Benzimidazoles; Benzoates; Blood Pressure; Calcium Channel Blockers; Diuretics; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hydrochlorothiazide; Hypertension; Male; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84892798383

The aims of this magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study were to investigate cartilage damage over three years and determine predictive factors.Methods: A total of 38 RA patients and 22 controls were enrolled at t = 0 (2009). After 3 years, clinical and MRI data were available in 28 patients and 15 controls. 3T MRI scans were scored for cartilage damage, bone erosion, synovitis and osteitis. A model was developed to predict cartilage damage from baseline parameters.Results: Inter-reader reliability for the Auckland MRI cartilage score (AMRICS) was high for status scores; intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), 0.90 (0.81 to 0.95) and moderate for change scores (ICC 0.58 (0.24 to 0.77)). AMRICS scores correlated with the Outcome MEasures in Rheumatoid Arthritis Clinical Trials (OMERACT) MRI joint space narrowing (jsn) and X-Ray (XR) jsn scores (r =0.96, P &lt; 0.0001 and 0.80, P &lt; 0.0001, respectively). AMRICS change scores were greater for RA patients than controls (P = 0.06 and P = 0.04 for the two readers). Using linear regression, baseline MRI cartilage, synovitis and osteitis scores predicted the three-year AMRICS (R2 = 0.67, 0.37 and 0.39, respectively). A multiple linear regression model predicted the three-year AMRICS (R2 = 0.78). Baseline radial osteitis predicted increased cartilage scores at the radiolunate and radioscaphoid joints, P = 0.0001 and 0.0012, respectively and synovitis at radioulnar, radiocarpal and intercarpal-carpometacarpal joints also influenced three-year cartilage scores (P-values of 0.001, 0.04 and 0.01, respectively).Conclusions: MRI cartilage damage progression is preceded by osteitis and synovitis but is most influenced by pre-existing cartilage damage suggesting primacy of the cartilage damage pathway in certain patients. ? 2014 McQueen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"adult; aged; article; articular cartilage; auckland mri cartilage score; bone erosion; carpometacarpal joint; cartilage damage; chondropathy; clinical article; controlled study; correlation coefficient; disease course; female; human; joint cavity; male; multiple linear regression analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; osteitis; prospective study; radiography; radius; rheumatoid arthritis; scaphoid bone; scoring system; synovitis; ulna; very elderly; wrist; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteitis; pathology; procedures; rheumatoid arthritis; wrist; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cartilage, Articular; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Osteitis; Prospective Studies; Synovitis; Wrist Joint",2-s2.0-84896730808

However, they are underutilised in hospitals due to resource constraints. We explored the perspectives of admitted trauma patients about the appeal, acceptability and content of a Brief Intervention (BI) delivered via text messages. Methods. Thirty mobile phone users (?16 years old) admitted to Auckland City Hospital as a result of injury were recruited (December 2010 - January 2011). Participants were interviewed face-to-face during their hospital stay using a semi-structured interview guide that explored topics including perceptions of the proposed intervention to reduce hazardous drinking and related harm, and perceived acceptability of an m-health program. Where issues relating to content of messages were raised by participants these were also captured. In addition, a brief survey captured information on demographic information, mobile phone usage and type of phone, along with the frequency of alcohol use. Results: 22 of the 30 participants were male, and almost half were aged 20 to 39 years. The majority of participants identified as New Zealand Europeans, six as M?ori (New Zealand's indigenous population) and of the remainder two each identified as Pacific and of Asian ethnicity. Most (28/30) participants used a mobile phone daily. 18 participants were deemed to be drinking in a non-hazardous manner, seven were hazardous drinkers, and three were non-drinkers. Most participants (21/30) indicated that text messages could be effective in reducing hazardous drinking and related harms, with more than half (17/30) signalling they would sign-up. Factors identified that would increase receptiveness included: awareness that the intervention was evidence-based; participants readiness-to-change; informative messages that include the consequences of drinking and practical advice; non-judgemental messages; and ease-of-use. Areas of potential concern included: confidentiality and frequency of messages. The cultural relevance of the messages for M?ori was highlighted as important.

Such programmes offer a potentially costeffective way to reach many individuals who do not currently access weight loss services. We developed a mHealth weight management programme using proven face-to-face behaviour change techniques and incorporating target population input. Our aim was to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and potential effectiveness of this programme for ethnically diverse adults with a view to informing a larger trial. Results: Fifty three adults who had a BMI of ?25 kg/m2 and wanted to lose weight (81% female, mean age 42 years, mean BMI 35.7 kg/m2, 26% Maori, 34% Pacific) received the eight-week mHealth weight loss programme. Anthropometric measures were taken at two face-to-face assessments at baseline and 12-weeks (i.e. four weeks after cessation of intervention). Twelve-week follow-up measurements were available for 36/53 participants (68%). Non-completers were younger and more likely to be male and of Pacific ethnicity. Thirty five participants (66%) reported reading 'all or most' text messages sent and 96% responded to at least one text data collection question over the eight-week active intervention period. Eighty one per cent of participants logged in to the study website at least once during the eight-week study period. In the intention-to-treat analysis, mean weight change was -1.0 kg (SD 3.1) at 12 weeks (p = 0.024) and change in BMI was -0.34 kg/m2 (SD 1.1) (p = 0.026). In the completers only analysis (n = 36), mean weight change was -1.4 kg (SD 3.6) (p = 0.023) and change in BMI was -0.50 kg/m2 (SD 1.3) (p = 0.025). Conclusions: A mHealth weight management programme is feasible to deliver to an ethnically diverse population. Changes in body weight and BMI at 12 weeks indicate that the programme could be effective in supporting people with weight loss. However, the high dropout rate indicates a need for further improvements to the programme.

All conditions seem to be linked by the concept of the metabolic syndrome (MetS), but the underlying causes are not known. MetS markers may have been mistaken for causes, thus many treatments are destined to be suboptimal. The current paper aims to critique current paradigms, give explanations for their persistence, and to return to first principles in an attempt to determine and clarify likely causes of MetS and obesity related comorbidities. A wide literature has been mined, study concepts analysed and the basics of human evolution and new biochemistry reviewed. A plausible, multifaceted composite unifying theory is formulated. The basis of the theory is that the proportionately large, energy-demanding human brain may have driven co-adaptive mechanisms to provide, or conserve, energy for the brain. A 'dual system' is proposed. 1) The enlarged, complex cortico-limbic-striatal system increases dietary energy by developing strong neural self-reward/motivation pathways for the acquisition of energy dense food, and (2) the nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) cellular protection system amplifies antioxidant, antitoxicant and repair activity by employing plant chemicals, becoming highly energy efficient in humans. The still-evolving, complex human cortico-limbic-striatal system generates strong behavioural drives for energy dense food procurement, including motivating agricultural technologies and social system development. Addiction to such foods, leading to neglect of nutritious but less appetizing 'common or garden' food, appears to have occurred. Insufficient consumption of food micronutrients prevents optimal human NRF2 function. Inefficient oxidation of excess energy forces central and non-adipose cells to store excess toxic lipid. Oxidative stress and metabolic inflammation, or metaflammation, allow susceptibility to infectious, degenerative atherosclerotic cardiovascular, autoimmune, neurodegenerative and dysplastic diseases. Other relevant human-specific co-adaptations are examined, and encompass the unusual ability to store fat, certain vitamin pathways, the generalised but flexible intestine and microbiota, and slow development and longevity. This theory has significant past and future corollaries, which are explored in a separate article by McGill, A-T, in Archives of Public Health, 72: 31. One line summary: Metabolic syndrome and obesity-related co-morbidities are largely explained by co-adaptations to the energy use of the large human brain in the cortico-limbic-striatal and NRF2 systems. ? 2014 McGill.",Cortico-limbic-striatal; Evolution and nutrition; Food addiction; Food micronutrient; Human brain metabolism; Malnutritive obesity (Malnubesity); Metabolic inflammation; Metabolic syndrome; Nuclear factor-erythroid 2- related factor 2 (NRF2); Obesity-related co-morbidities; Oxidative stress; Theory review,,2-s2.0-84988859597

Tasks assessing social avoidance and perceptions of available social networks in the context of bowel/health problems were conducted. Manipulation checks confirmed the elicitation of disgust and state mindfulness in the applicable conditions. As expected, persons in the disgust condition were more likely to exhibit immediate social avoidance (rejecting a glass of water). State disgust predicted greater socially avoidant decision-making, less decisional conflict, and smaller social network maps. State mindfulness predicted fewer names on inner network circles and amplified the effect of disgust on creating smaller social network maps. This report furthers understanding of disgust and avoidance in bowel health contexts, and suggests the need for caution in mindfulness interventions that raise awareness of emotion without also providing skills in emotional regulation. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Avoidance; Bowel health; Decision-making; Disgust; Emotion; Mindfulness,adolescent; adult; decision making; emotion; female; human; male; mindfulness; odor; randomization; social distance; social support; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Decision Making; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Mindfulness; Odors; Random Allocation; Social Distance; Social Support; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84939876305

To examine the association between alcohol consumption and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) overall and by body mass index. Methods. Cross-sectional study of employed individuals. Daily alcohol intakes were calculated from a self-administered food frequency questionnaire by 5,512 Maori, Pacific Island, and European workers (3,992 men, 1520 women) aged 40 years and above. Results. There were 170 new cases of T2DM. Compared to the group with no alcohol consumption and adjusting for age, sex, and ethnicity, the group consuming alcohol had relative risks of T2DM of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.08, 0.65) in normal weight individuals, 0.38 (0.18, 0.81) in overweight individuals, and 0.99 (0.59, 1.67) in obese individuals. After further adjusting for total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, smoking habit, physical activity, socioeconomic status, body mass index, and hypertension, the relative risks of T2DM were 0.16 (0.05, 0.50) in normal weight individuals, 0.43 (0.19, 0.97) in overweight individuals, and 0.92 (0.52, 1.60) in overweight individuals. Across the categories of alcohol consumption, there was an approximate U-shaped relationship for new cases of T2DM. There was no significant association between alcohol consumption and IGT.

Despite these international trends, New Zealand continues to tolerate direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) of prescription medication, a controversial pharmaceutical marketing strategy that has been prohibited in all but two countries in the industrialised world. While the pharmaceutical industry asserts that DTCA is informational and empowers consumers, in this viewpoint article we argue that DTCA is a heavily biased source of health information that favours representation of benefits over harms, and is associated with unnecessary prescribing, iatrogenic harm and increased costs to the taxpayer. In this paper, we show that DTCA provides unbalanced information to consumers who may misconstrue DTCA as public health messages, and fail to recognise inherent commercial bias. We describe how DTCA has been linked with inappropriate prescribing and overtreatment, with evidence indicating that patients request and receive specific medications in response to DTCA, even when treatment is not clinically indicated. This exposes patients to unnecessary adverse effects and iatrogenic harm, and increases costs for the health-care sector through the prescription of expensive branded medication. We use local examples to illustrate these points. New Zealand remains an outlier in allowing DTCA to continue which, in our view, is a controversial and harmful practice. The available evidence suggests that consumers and health care professionals are generally opposed to DTCA. Therefore, we believe that the New Zealand government should review its stance on DTCA. ?

Turnover of villous trophoblast is affected by impaired placental perfusion in preeclampsia. Expression and localisation of cadherins and cytokeratins are involved in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. However, studies describing the associations between cadherins and cytokeratins in preeclampsia are limited. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, cytokeratin 18 and cytokeratin 19 in placentae from women with preeclampsia in order to determine whether their expression differs with disease severity. Methods 29 preeclamptic placentae and 25 normotensive placentae were included in this study. The expression of E-cadherin, cytokeratin 18, cytokeratin 19 andN-cadherin was quantified by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. Results E-cadherin, cytokeratin 18 and cytokeratin 19 were expressed predominantly in the syncytiotrophoblast of the placenta and the expression of E-cadherin, cytokeratin 18 and cytokeratin 19 was significantly increased in preeclampsia compared to normotensive pregnancies. However, there was no significant difference in expression between severe preeclampsia and mild preeclampsia. In addition, there was no difference in the expression of N-cadherin between preeclampsic and normotensive pregnancies. Discussion Our data demonstrated increased expression of E-cadherin, cytokeratin 18 and cytokeratin 19 in the syncytiotrophoblast of preeclamptic placentae, but this increase was not correlated with disease severity.

We aimed to determine a ketofol dosing regimen for short procedural sedation and analgesia of 5-to 20-minute duration in healthy patients (2-20 y). Methods: Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters were used to simulate drug concentration and effect profiles over time for different ketamine-to-propofol ratios (1:1-1:10). The target effect was a Children's Hospital of Wisconsin Sedation Scale score of less than 2. Combined effects were additive, with a propofol EC50 of 1.54 g/mL (concentration required to produce hypnosis in 50% of patients), a ketamine EC50 of 0.44 g/mL, and a slope of 5.3. Emergence threshold concentrations for propofol were 2.0 g/mL in children and 1.8 g/mL in adults as well as 0.5 g/mL for ketamine (children and adults). The EC50 for propofol antiemesis was 0.343 g/mL. Results: A ketamine-to-propofol ratio of 1:3 was the best combination for intermittent dosing, achieving a rapid onset of a Children's Hospital ofWisconsin Sedation Scale score of less than 2 within 1minute and a time to emergence of 9 to 19 minutes in all ages after a 10-minute sedation. The optimal ketofol dosing in children (2-11 y) was 0.1 mL/kg initially followed by 0.05 mL/kg at 2 minutes and then 0.025 mL/kg for the subsequent doses. The adults (12-20 y) received 0.05 mL/kg of ketofol initially followed by 0.025 mL/kg for the subsequent doses. These regimens maintain a propofol antiemesis for 30 to 40 minutes after the last dose. Conclusions: We suggest an optimal ratio of racemic ketamine to propofol of 1:3 for boluses during short procedures (5-20 minutes). A short ketofol infusion, ratio 1:4, is a suitable alternative to intermittent boluses. Ratios greater than 1:3 result in delayed recovery after 20 minutes..

This causes debilitating visual impairment which may necessitate corneal transplantation. Therapeutic targets related to disease mechanisms are currently lacking, as the pathobiology remains unclear. Many pathological features may be manifestations of defects in wound healing and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-associated functions. In a wide range of tissue and cell types, antioxidant exposure has beneficial effects on both of these pathways. This study investigated the effect of treatment with the antioxidant riboflavin on wound healing and ROS-associated functions in keratoconus. Methods: Stromal cells were isolated from human central keratoconic (n = 3) and normal (n = 3) corneas. Total RNA was extracted and reverse-transcribed into complementary DNA. The gene expression of 22 genes involved in repair (eight normal and four repair-type extracellular matrix constituents) and ROS-associated processes (eight antioxidants and two ROS-synthesising oxidases) was quantified using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. This was also performed on keratoconic stromal cells treated in vitro with riboflavin (n = 3). Results: In stromal cells from untreated keratoconic corneas (compared with untreated normal corneas), there was an up-regulation of 7/12 extracellular matrix elements. Four of eight antioxidants and two of two oxidases were also increased. In treated keratoconic corneas (compared with untreated keratoconic corneas), six out of eight normal extracellular matrix constituents were up-regulated and two of four repair-type molecules were reduced. An increase was also observed in seven out of eight antioxidants and there was a diminution in two out of two oxidases. Conclusion: Riboflavin encourages the synthesis of a normal extracellular matrix and reduces reactive oxygen species levels in keratoconus. This supports the occurrence of wound healing and ROS-associated abnormalities in keratoconus. By targeting the causative disease mechanisms, riboflavin may have therapeutic potential in the clinical management of keratoconus. ? 2014 Optometrists Association Australia.",Antioxidant; Keratoconus; Oxidative damage; Wound healing,reactive oxygen metabolite; riboflavin; RNA; scleroprotein; vitamin B complex; biosynthesis; cornea stroma; drug effects; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; keratoconus; metabolism; oxidative stress; pathology; polymerase chain reaction; Corneal Stroma; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Keratoconus; Oxidative Stress; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reactive Oxygen Species; Riboflavin; RNA; Vitamin B Complex,2-s2.0-84925547262

Although these complications can be prevented by HCV eradication, current treatment uptake is <1% per annum. We describe the burden of HCV infection and estimate the effect of four different treatment strategies to reduce HCV-related morbidity and mortality. Methods Baseline model parameters were based upon literature review and expert consensus, focusing on New Zealand data. Four scenarios were modelled: Scenario 1 estimated the impact of increased treatment efficacy, while Scenario 2 estimated the effect of increased treatment efficacy and gradual increases in numbers treated. Scenarios 3 and 4 estimated the impact of deferred introduction of new DAAs for either 1 or 2 years. Results Prevalence of HCV infection peaked in 2010 (50,480 cases). Peak prevalence of cirrhosis and HCC will occur after 2030. Scenario 2 resulted in sizeable decreases in HCV-related morbidity and mortality. The impact of Scenario 1 was smaller. Deferring funding for new DAA treatments for a further 1 or 2 years resulted in an 18-36% increase in liver-related deaths in 2030. Conclusions While prevalence of chronic HCV infection may have peaked, disease burden continues to grow.

This study compares the survival of cancer patients diagnosed in 2006–10 in the whole populations of New Zealand and Australia. Method Identical period survival methods were used to calculate relative survival ratios for all cancers combined, and for 18 cancers each accounting for more than 50 deaths per year in New Zealand, from 1 to 10 years from diagnosis. Results Cancer survival was lower in New Zealand, with 5-year relative survival being 4.2% lower in women, and 3.8% lower in men for all cancers combined. Of 18 cancers, 14 showed lower survival in New Zealand; the exceptions, with similar survival in each country, being melanoma, myeloma, mesothelioma, and cervical cancer. For most cancers, the differences in survival were maximum at 1 year after diagnosis, becoming smaller later; however, for breast cancer, the survival difference increased with time after diagnosis. Conclusion The lower survival in New Zealand, and the higher mortality rates shown earlier, suggest that further improvements in recognition, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer in New Zealand should be possible. As the survival differences are seen soon after diagnosis, issues of early management in primary care and time intervals to diagnosis and treatment may be particularly important. ?

The Report Card presents a review of current evidence across 9 key indicators, including physical activity (PA), organized sport and free play, sedentary behavior, and community and government initiatives across New Zealand. Methods: Nationally representative survey data were collated by researchers at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, between June and December 2013. The grade for each indicator is based on the percentage of children and youth meeting a defined benchmark: A is 81%-100%; B is 61%-80%; C is 41%-60%, D is 21%-40%; F is 0%-20%; INC is incomplete data. Results: Overall PA received a score of B, as did Organized Sport Participation and Active Play. PA participation in School Environment scored slightly less with a score of B-. Sedentary Behaviors, Family and Peers, and Community and Built Environment scored a grade of C. Active transportation received a score of C-. An inconclusive grade was given for the Government indicator due to a lack of established international criteria for assessment. Conclusions: PA participation in New Zealand is satisfactory, but could improve. However, sedentary behavior is high. Of particular concern is the age-related decline in PA participation, particularly among adolescent females, and the increase in sedentary behavior. ? 2014 Human Kinetics, Inc.",Child health; Health communication; Knowledge translation,adolescent; behavior; child; child health; family; government; human; juvenile; medical information; New Zealand; physical activity; scientist; sport; university; consumer advocacy; environmental planning; exercise; female; health care policy; health promotion; health survey; male; motor activity; New Zealand; organization and management; procedures; program evaluation; recreation; sedentary lifestyle; Adolescent; Child; Consumer Advocacy; Environment Design; Exercise; Female; Health Policy; Health Promotion; Health Surveys; Humans; Male; Motor Activity; New Zealand; Play and Playthings; Program Evaluation; Sedentary Lifestyle; Sports,2-s2.0-84925227214

Both clinical observations in humans and recent experimental work on isolated rat ventricular myocytes suggest the dominant mechanisms of this syndrome are related to acute catecholamine overload. However, relating observed differences in single cells to the capacity of such alterations to result in the extreme changes in ventricular shape seen in Takotsubo syndrome is difficult. By using a computational model of the rat left ventricle, we investigate which mechanisms can give rise to the typical shape of the ventricle observed in this syndrome. Three potential dominant mechanisms related to effects of β-adrenergic stimulation were considered: apical-basal variation of calcium transients due to differences in L-type and sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activation, apical-basal variation of calcium sensitivity due to differences in troponin I phosphorylation, and apical-basal variation in maximal active tension due to, e.g., the negative inotropic effects of p38 MAPK. Furthermore, we investigated the interaction of these spatial variations in the presence of a failing Frank-Starling mechanism. We conclude that a large portion of the apex needs to be affected by severe changes in calcium regulation or contractile function to result in apical ballooning, and smooth linear variation from apex to base is unlikely to result in the typical ventricular shape observed in this syndrome. A failing Frank-Starling mechanism significantly increases apical ballooning at end systole and may be an important additional factor underpinning Takotsubo syndrome. ? 2014 the American Physiological Society.",Cardiac modeling; Catecholamine overload; Takotsubo cardiomyopathy,"adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); calcium channel L type; catecholamine; troponin I; beta adrenergic receptor; beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; isoprenaline; adrenergic activity; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; beta adrenergic stimulation; geometry; heart afterload; heart failure; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle cell; heart muscle contractility; inotropism; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; rat; Starling law; takotsubo cardiomyopathy; animal; biological model; calcium signaling; computer simulation; disease model; drug effects; heart contraction; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle; heart ventricle pressure; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathophysiology; statistical model; takotsubo cardiomyopathy; Adrenergic beta-Agonists; Animals; Calcium Signaling; Computer Simulation; Disease Models, Animal; Heart Ventricles; Isoproterenol; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Cine; Models, Cardiovascular; Myocardial Contraction; Myocytes, Cardiac; Rats; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta; Stroke Volume; Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Pressure",2-s2.0-84925068564

Costs during the trial (randomisation January 2010 – May 2012, median follow-up 19 months, maximum follow-up 36 months) were inflated to 2012 costs.Results: Our analysis showed a statistically significantly lower mean pharmaceutical expenditure of $989 (95% CI, $648–$1331) per patient per year in the polypill arm compared with usual care (P < 0.001; adjusted, excluding polypill cost). No significant difference was shown in health service expenditure.Conclusions: This study provides evidence of significant cost savings to the taxpayer and Australian Government through the introduction of a CVD polypill strategy. The savings will be less now than during the trial due to subsequent reductions in the costs of usual care. Nonetheless, given the prevalence of CVD in Australia, the introduction of this polypill could increase considerably the efficiency of health care expenditure in Australia. ? 2014, Australasian Medical Publishing Co.

Patients' illness perceptions have been found to play a role in somatoform disorders. However, it is unclear whether illness perceptions predict higher health costs in these patients. Method A total of 1785 primary care patients presenting a new health complaint completed a questionnaire on their illness perceptions and emotional distress before the consultation. The physicians completed a questionnaire for each patient on diagnostics after the consultation. In a stratified subsample, physician interviewers established diagnoses of DSM-IV somatization and undifferentiated somatoform disorders (n = 144) using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry. Healthcare expenditure was obtained from Danish health registers for a 2-year follow-up period. Results Patients had more negative perceptions of their well-defined physical health problems when they had a co-morbid somatoform disorder. A strong illness identity [β = 0.120, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.029-0.212, p = 0.012], perceived negative consequences (β = 0.010, 95% CI 0.001-0.019, p = 0.024), a long timeline perspective (β = 0.013, 95% CI 0.005-0.021, p = 0.001), low personal control (β = - 0.009, 95% CI -0.015 to -0.002, p = 0.011) and negative emotional representations (β = 0.009, 95% CI 0.002-0.017, p = 0.020) predicted healthcare expenditure in somatoform disorders. Conclusions The results suggest that illness perceptions play a role in the perpetuation of symptoms in somatoform disorders and predict higher future healthcare expenditure among a subgroup of these patients. ?

Structural vascular remodeling typical of pulmonary hypertensive disease was implemented in the model by progressively altering the mechanical properties of the arterial geometry and progressively increasing the inlet pulse pressure (PP). The transmission of PP throughout the tree was shown to increase in advanced stages of disease, creating the potential for a 'vicious-cycle' of damage to vasculature. Wall shear stress (WSS) was shown to be highest in the terminal arteries of the model and increased significantly with disease. A further trend observed in WSS results was that high WSS values began to 'climb' the arterial tree towards the proximal vessels as disease progressed. This suggests a link between WSS and distal remodeling in pulmonary hypertensive disease, which initiates in the small muscular arteries and arterioles and spreads into larger arteries as the disease progresses. ? 2014 IEEE.",,"arteriole; biological model; biomechanics; blood flow; blood pressure; hemodynamics; human; lung; lung circulation; pathophysiology; pulmonary hypertension; pulsatile flow; vascular remodeling; vascularization; Arterioles; Biomechanical Phenomena; Blood Pressure; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Lung; Models, Cardiovascular; Pulmonary Circulation; Pulsatile Flow; Regional Blood Flow; Vascular Remodeling",2-s2.0-84923157055

Summary Answer: MSCs from SGA newborns were found to express an altered EGR-1-dependent gene network involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and oxidative stress. What is Known Already: Individuals with suboptimal intrauterine development are at greater risk of metabolic diseases such as type II diabetes, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Study Design, Size, Duration: Umbilical cords (n = 283) from the GUSTO (growing up in Singapore towards healthy outcomes) birth cohort study, and primary MSC isolates established from SGA and matched control cases (n = 6 per group), were subjected to gene expression analysis and candidate genes were studied for functional validation. Participants/Materials, Setting, Methods: Umbilical cord specimens were derived from babies born at the National University Hospital (NUH) in Singapore. Local ethical approvalwas obtained.MSCisolates were established in Wharton's jelly and molecular analysis was conducted by gene expression microarrays andRT-PCR. Cells fromSGAand control groups were compared in the presence and absence of insulin and candidate gene function was studied via siRNA-mediated gene knockdown and over-expression experiments in MSCs. Main Results and the Role of Chance: Using repeated measureANOVAs, proliferation rates of MSCs isolated from SGA neonates were found to be significantly increased (P < 0.01). In the absence of insulin, EGR-1 levels were found to be significantly reduced in the group of SGA-derived MSCs, whereas EGR-1 expression was found to be up-regulated in the same group in the presence of insulin (P < 0.01). EGR-1 was found to induce expression of COX-2 in the SGA group (P < 0.01) and both, EGR-1 and COX-2 stimulated glucose uptake in MSCs (P < 0.01). EGR-1 andCOX-2 levels were associated in whole umbilical cords (n = 283, P < 0.01) and EGR-1 positively correlated with abdominal circumference and birthweight (n = 91, P < 0.01 and n = 91, P < 0.01). Limitations, Reasons for Caution: Cell models may not entirely reflect the physiology of the host and patient follow-up studies will be necessary for further clinical validation. Wider Implications of the Findings: Our study suggests that Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs are useful in identifying pathways specific for fetal growth restriction.

Method Women in late pregnancy (>37 weeks gestation) or who had recently delivered (<6 weeks postnatal) completed a questionnaire about their antenatal care. Logistic regression analysis evaluated whether late booking for antenatal care was associated with demographic factors and potential barriers to accessing care. Results Of the 826 women who participated, 137 (17%) booked for antenatal care at >18 weeks (late bookers). The ethnic composition of the sample was: 43% Pacific Peoples, 20% M?ori, 14% Asian, and 21% European or other ethnicities. The multivariate analysis indicated that women were significantly more likely to book late for antenatal care if they had limited resources (OR=1.86; 95% CI=1.17–2.93), no tertiary education (OR=1.96; 95% CI=1.23– 3.15), or were not living with a husband/partner (OR=2.34; 95% CI=1.48–3.71). In addition, the odds of late booking for antenatal care was almost six times higher among M?ori (OR=5.70; 95% CI=2.57–12.64) and Pacific (OR=5.90; 95% CI=2.83–12.29) women compared to those of European and other ethnicities.

Method Data drawn for the New Zealand Atlas of Healthcare Variation was used to examine regularity of allopurinol dispensing, laboratory testing for serum urate, and acute hospitalisation for gout. Standardised rates by age, gender, ethnicity and District Health Board (DHB) of domicile were calculated. Results For New Zealanders aged 20–79 years with gout, 57% were dispensed allopurinol in 2010/11. Of these, 69% were receiving allopurinol regularly, and only 34% of people dispensed allopurinol had serum urate testing in a 6-month period. The annual hospitalisation rate was 1% of people with gout. M?ori and Pacific people with gout were less likely to be on regular allopurinol treatment, despite having more than twice the chance of being hospitalised with acute gout. Conclusion We have demonstrated that routinely collected health data can be used to monitor the quality of care for people with gout at a high level. Primary care initiatives that focus on ensuring a continuous supply of urate-lowering therapy to achieve therapeutic serum urate targets are required to improve the impact of gout in Aotearoa New Zealand. ?

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mechanism that contributes to gene regulation, and is prevalent in all vertebrates. Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) is a cost-effective technique to generate genome-wide DNA methylation maps and has been used in mammalian genomes (e.g., human, mouse and rat) but not in zebrafish. High-resolution DNA methylation data in zebrafish are limited: increased availability of such data will enable us to model and better understand the roles, causes and consequences of changes in DNA methylation. Here we present five high-resolution DNA methylation maps for wild-type zebrafish brain (two pooled male and two pooled female methylomes) and liver. These data were generated using the RRBS technique (includes 1.43 million CpG sites of zebrafish genome) on the Illumina HiSeq platform. Alignment to the reference genome was performed using the Zv9 genome assembly.To our knowledge, these datasets are the only RRBS datasets and base-resolution DNA methylation data available at this time for zebrafish brain and liver. These datasets could serve as a resource for future studies to document the functional role of DNA methylation in zebrafish. In addition, these datasets could be used as controls while performing analysis on treated samples. ? 2014 The Authors.",Brain; DNA methylation; Genome sequencing; Liver; RRBS; Zebrafish,animal tissue; Article; brain; CpG island; DNA methylation; epigenetics; female; genetic analysis; liver; male; nonhuman; reduced representation bisulfite sequencing; zebra fish; Danio rerio; Mammalia; Rattus; Vertebrata,2-s2.0-84920621682

Design: An exploratory study involving a survey, which asked participants to indicate the pharmacy services they had ever used, and rate the importance of 22 pharmacy services to them, or the person they care for, or for their consumers if a pharmacist. Setting: Four regions of Australia: Logan-Beaudesert and Mt Isa/North West region, Queensland, Northern Rivers, New South Wales, and the Greater Perth area, Western Australia. Participants: Surveys were undertaken with 602 consumers and 91 community pharmacists. Results: Community pharmacy is predominantly used to obtain advice about medication and whether a doctor's visit is necessary, as well as for monitoring and screening services. Pharmacy services that were patient centric were important, such as individualised medication advice and respectful care, as well as tools or procedures to facilitate streamlined medication access. Less important services included adult vaccinations and health and wellness programmes. Carers identified services that assisted them with their specific role/s to be important. Overall, community pharmacists had a good understanding of the services that were important to people with chronic conditions and their carers. Conclusions: People with chronic conditions and their carers not only care about what services are delivered, but how they are delivered; they sought services that generally improved their access to medication and information, but in a way that was patient centred. Ultimately, pharmacists understood the importance of patient-centred care for people with chronic conditions and their carers, perhaps indicating a greater acceptance of integrating patient-centred care into their everyday practice. ? 2014, BMJ Publishing Group.

Research into metabolic disease has revealed these core mechanisms are highly co-dependent. This emerging field of research, termed immunometabolism, focuses on understanding how metabolism influences immunological processes and vice versa. It is now accepted that obesity influences the immune system and that obesity-driven inflammation contributes to many diseases including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer’s disease. The immune response requires the reallocation of nutrients within immune cells to different metabolic pathways to satisfy energy demands and the production of necessary macromolecules. One aspect of immunometabolic research is understanding how these metabolic changes help regulate specific immune cell functions. It is hoped that further understanding of the pathways involved in managing this immunological-metabolic interface will reveal new ways to treat metabolic disease. Given their growing status as principle drivers of obesity-associated inflammation, monocytes/macrophages have received much attention when studying the consequences of inflammation within adipose tissue. Less is known regarding how metabolic changes within macrophages (metabolic reprogramming) influence their immune cell function. In this review, we focus on our current understanding of how monocytes/macrophages alter their intracellular metabolism during the immune response and how these changes dictate specific effector functions. In particular, the immunomodulatory functions of mitochondrial metabolism and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. We also highlight how the attributes of the zebrafish model system can be exploited to reveal new mechanistic insights into immunometabolic processes. ? 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Immunity; Immunometabolism; Macrophage; Metabolism; mROS; Zebrafish,"reactive oxygen metabolite; green fluorescent protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; adipose tissue; Alzheimer disease; cardiovascular disease; cell function; energy; human; immune response; immune system; immunocompetent cell; macromolecule; macrophage; macrophage function; metabolism; mitochondrial respiration; monocyte; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nutrient; obesity; Review; animal; cytology; hypertension; immunology; inflammation; mitochondrion; neoplasm; zebra fish; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Humans; Hypertension; Immune System; Inflammation; Macrophages; Mitochondria; Monocytes; Neoplasms; Obesity; Reactive Oxygen Species; Zebrafish",2-s2.0-84919846808

OBJECTIVE To determine if regional failure in patients with OSCC and pathologically negative neck nodes (pN-) is due to an incomplete sampling procedure during surgery. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 2258 patients from 11 cancer centers worldwide who underwent neck dissection for OSCC (1990-2011) and who were pN-. Of those, 345 had clinical evidence of nodal metastases (cN+) on radiologic workup. The neck specimens were available for reanalysis in 193 patients. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier graphs and analyzed by multivariable analysis. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Five-year overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), and disease-free survival (DFS). RESULTS: Resectioning and analysis of the neck dissection specimens in the cN+/pN-subgroup revealed false-negative results in 29 (15%) of 193 patients. The negative predictive value of the initial pathologic examination was 85%. The 5-year OS and DSS in the cN-/pN-group were 77.6%and 87.2%, respectively. The 5-year OS and DSS of the cN+/pN- group were 62.6%and 78.5%, respectively (P < .001). In multivariable analysis, cN+ classification was significantly associated with poor OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.7; 95%CI, 1.1-3.8; P = .03) and poor DSS (HR, 1.46; 95%CI, 1.1-4.1; P = .04). A cN+ classification was associated with lower DFS (66.3%vs 76.2%; P = .05) and lower regional recurrence-free survival (68.6%vs 78.8%; P = .02) but not with local (P = .20) or distant recurrence (P = .80). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Pathologic staging underestimates the incidence of nodal metastases in cN+ disease. After correction for pathologically missed nodal metastases, radiologic evidence of neck nodes is an independent predictor of outcome, suggesting that traditional sampling during surgery might miss metastases, and this fact might explain the origin of treatment failure in these patients.

As such there have been no studies specifically designed to evaluate predictors of CAP. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the accuracy of 4 parameters (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation [APACHE] II score, C-reactive protein [CRP], D-dimer, and intra-abdominal pressure [IAP]) for predicting CAP early after hospital admission. During the study period, data on patients with AP were prospectively collected and D-dimer, CRP, and IAP levels were measured using standard methods at admission whereas the APACHE II score was calculated within 24 hours of hospital admission. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was applied and the likelihood ratios were calculated to evaluate the predictive accuracy. A total of 173 consecutive patients were included in the analysis and 47 (27%) of them developed CAP. The overall hospital mortality was 11% (19 of 173). APACHE II score ?11 and IAP ?13 mm Hg showed significantly better overall predictive accuracy than D-dimer and CRP (area under the ROC curve-0.94 and 0.92 vs 0.815 and 0.667, correspondingly). The positive likelihood ratio of APACHE II score is excellent (9.9) but of IAP is moderate (4.2). The latter can be improved by adding CRP (5.8). In conclusion, of the parameters studied, APACHE II score and IAP are the best available predictors of CAP within 24 hours of hospital admission. Given that APACHE II score is rather cumbersome, the combination of IAP and CRP appears to be the most practical way to predict critical course of AP early after hospital admission.

Interactive and contextually relevant training appeared to be more effective than didactic strategies. Narratives and role-plays (from the perspective of consumers, carers and health professionals) are effective in promoting more positive attitudes and reduce stigma. Flexible on-line delivery methods with video footage of expert and consumer narratives were preferable for a cost-effective programme accessible to a wide community pharmacy workforce.Originality/value – There is a clear need for mental health education for community pharmacists and support staff in Australia. Training should target reducing stigma and negative attitudes, improving knowledge and building confidence and skills to improve pharmacy staff’s perceived value of working with mental health consumers.

A range of different solute carrier families, including members from the SLC2A, SLC11A, SLC22A, SLC25A, SLC30A, SLC31A, SLC39A, SLC40A, SLC47A and SLCO1B families, and various metal substrates, including arsenic, copper, gadolinium, iron, platinum and zinc, have been implicated in these cancer-related transport processes. For example, the transport of platinum-based anticancer drugs has been reported to be influenced by the expression and activities of OCT1-3 (SLC22A1-3), OCTN1/2 (SLC22A4/5), CTR1/2 (SLC31A1/2) and MATE1/2 (SLC47A1/2) solute carriers. As another example, solute carriers mediate control over the availability of endogenous metal ions, such as copper, iron and zinc, may have key roles in regulating tumour angiogenesis, cell proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and aberrantMAPK and STAT-3 signal transduction in cancer. In conclusion, emerging mechanisms involving metal transporting solute carriers are being defined and seem likely to make major contributions to cancer development and progression, and to the delivery of anticancer and tumour imaging agents.

Statistics from the American Lung Association and American Cancer Society reveal that mortality from COPD and lung cancer are lowest in Hispanic subjects and generally highest in African American subjects, with mortality in non-Hispanic white subjects and Asian subjects in between. This observation, described as the “Hispanic paradox”, persists after adjusting for confounding variables, notably smoking exposure and sociodemographic factors. While differences in genetic predisposition might underlie this observation, differences in diet remain a possible explanation. Such a hypothesis is supported by the observation that a diet high in fruit and vegetables has been shown to confer a protective effect on both COPD and lung cancer. In this article, we hypothesise that a diet rich in legumes may explain, in part, the Hispanic paradox, given the traditionally high consumption of legumes (beans and lentils) by Hispanic subjects. Legumes are very high in fibre and have recently been shown to attenuate systemic inflammation significantly, which has previously been linked to susceptibility to COPD and lung cancer in large prospective studies. A similar protective effect could be attributed to the consumption of soy products (from soybeans) in Asian subjects, for whom a lower incidence of COPD and lung cancer has also been reported. This hypothesis requires confirmation in cohort studies and randomised control trials, where the effects of diet on outcomes can be carefully examined in a prospective study design. ?

The men negotiated and renegotiated their gay identity and being gay was reported as just one part of most men’s lives. Many men did not like to be labeled as gay and downplayed aspects of their gay identity. Only a few men proclaimed being gay. Men reported very mixed experiences with the gay community/ies. Understanding how men experience being gay, provides information vital to enhancing policy, research and practice responses to gay men’s health issues. A major challenge for health service provision to appropriately engage with men who have sex with other men but resist being labeled as gay was identified. ?

The first signs show up in the respiratory organs because respiration is a continuous heat exchange process in which the body is in closest contact with the ambient air. There are no behavioral or other adjustments to prevent the ambient air from entering into the body’s core area through the respiratory tract. The Acclimatization Thermal Strain Index (ATSI) describes the acclimatization thermal loading (ATL) on respiratory organs until full adaptation is achieved. The aim here is to further assess the ATSI scheme using a range of actual but contrasting bioclimatic conditions. To simulate ATL, scenarios of the consequences of acclimatization due to movement to or from five contrasting climates are used. The results show that adjusting to cold comes with greater physiological strain than adjusting to heat, the biggest impact occurring for a change of location from hot-humid to cold-dry climatic conditions. The approach can be used to assess risks due to increases in short-term thermal variability in weather conditions such as encountered during heat waves and cold snaps. The information could also be useful for assessing the need for public health services and measures that might be used to help mitigate impacts. ? 2014, ISB.",Acclimatization; Acclimatization Thermal Strain Index; Cold strain; Heat strain; Human bioclimate; Physiological adaptation,acclimatization; China; climate; human; Niger; Russian Federation; Singapore; temperature; thermoregulation; United Arab Emirates; vapor pressure; Acclimatization; Body Temperature Regulation; China; Climate; Humans; Niger; Russia; Singapore; Temperature; United Arab Emirates; Vapor Pressure,2-s2.0-84911808029

Its impacts will be disproportionately borne by the most disadvantaged populations, including indigenous peoples. For M?ori in Aotearoa/New Zealand, as with other indigenous peoples worldwide, colonization has led to dispossession of land, destabilization of cultural foundations, and social, economic, and political marginalization. Climate change threatens to exacerbate these processes, adding future insult to historical and contemporary injury. Yet the challenges posed by climate change are accompanied by considerable opportunities to advance indigenous rights and reduce health disparities.

Repeating back important information (readback) is thought to enhance the effectiveness of communication across many industries. However, formal communication protocols are uncommon in healthcare teams.Aims We aimed to quantify the effect of readback on the transfer of information between members of a healthcare team during a simulated clinical crisis. We hypothesised that reading back information provided by other team members would result in better knowledge of that information by the receiver than verbal response without read-back or no verbal response.Method Postanaesthesia care unit nurses and anaesthetic assistants were given clinically relevant items of information at the start of 88 simulations. A clinical crisis prompted calling an anaesthetist, with no prior knowledge of the patient. Using video recordings of the simulations, we noted each time a piece of information was mentioned to the anaesthetist. Their response was coded as read-back, verbal response without read-back or no verbal response.Results If the anaesthetists read back the item of information, or otherwise verbally responded, they were, respectively, 8.27 (p<0.001) or 3.16 (p=0.03) times more likely to know the information compared with no verbal response.Conclusions Our results suggest that training healthcare teams to use read-back techniques could increase information transfer between team members with the potential for improved patient safety.

Objective: Among this cohort of children, we aim to investigate whether these probiotics could modify the expression of genetic predisposition to eczema conferred by genetic variation in susceptibility genes. Methods: Thirty-three eczema susceptibility SNPs (in eleven genes) were genotyped in 331 children of European ancestry. Results: Children who carried a genetic variant that put them at a high risk of developing eczema were less likely to develop eczema if they had been randomized to the HN001 intervention group compared to those in the placebo group. HN019 was also able to protect against the effects of some SNPs. As well as modifying genetic susceptibility to childhood eczema, HN001 was also found to modify genetic susceptibility to eczema severity and atopy risk. Conclusion and Clinical Relevance: This is the first study to show an effect of a probiotic on reducing eczema risk amongst those with particular eczema-associated genotypes.

Repetitive rotational stresses in the lower extremities during tennis may lead to sport-specific range of motion adaptations, which may increase the risk of injury to other joints along the kinetic chain.Purpose: To assess whether such range of motion adaptations occur in the hip, and if so, to identify whether they are associated with injury.Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3.Methods: A total of 125 female professional tennis players, the majority of whom were ranked in the top 200 World Tennis Association singles rankings, underwent a comprehensive preparticipation physical health status examination. Hip range of motion was assessed using a digital inclinometer and side-to-side differences in rotational parameters calculated, and associations with previous injuries were identified.Results: A history of an abdominal strain was reported by 10% of players, and there was an association between abdominal strains and the presence of hip flexion contractures (odds ratio, 6.1; P = .006). Hip flexion contractures were bilateral in 85% of those found, affected only the nondominant side in 9%, and affected only the dominant side in 6%. We were unable to identify any specific side-to-side rotational adaptations in the dominant or nondominant hips, and no association between loss of hip range of motion and shoulder, lower back, hip, knee, or ankle injuries was found.Conclusion: We report an association in female professional tennis players between abdominal strains and flexion contractures of the hip with iliopsoas tightness. We did not find evidence of specific hip adaptations in rotational range of motion. If hip flexion contractures are found on clinical examination, a stretching program may be indicated.

After excluding three patients with diabetes mellitus, 83% had evidence of autonomic dysfunction; all patients had at least one autonomic symptom and 91% had more than two symptoms. We also found a higher rate of downbeat nystagmus (65%) than previously described in CANVAS. We confirmed that sensory findings on nerve conduction tests were consistent with a sensory ganglionopathy and describe two patients with loss of trigeminal sensation consistent with previous pathological descriptions of trigeminal sensory ganglionopathy. Our results suggest that autonomic dysfunction is a major feature of CANVAS. This has implications for the management of patients with CANVAS as the autonomic symptoms may be amenable to treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Having been surprised by selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant-treated patients who became prone to pathological intoxication, we examined this association, searching for relevant literature and cases. METHODS: A detailed literature search showed little or no interaction between SSRIs and alcohol in laboratory studies, and inconsistent effects of these drugs in problem drinkers. We collected cases to study from our own and colleagues' practices, regulatory agencies and web-based discussion fora, and considered evidence for interactions according to standard criteria. RESULTS: Pathological intoxication, characterized by unexpected and often gross disinhibition, was identified in 100 of 201 reports that provided enough detail to be evaluated. Memory impairment was prominent in just over half (53/100) of these. Outcomes included serious violence; homicide occurred in 8 cases, including two double and one triple homicide (12 deaths). CONCLUSIONS: Multiple lines of evidence amplify a thus far barely recognized signal of interactions of SSRI and related antidepressants with alcohol. Systematic collection of further data is required to further characterize this syndrome, but in the meantime effective warnings must be introduced to alert prescribers and patients to the serious risk of pathological intoxication during antidepressant treatment. ? 2014 - IOS Press and the authors.",Alcohol; antidepressant; disinhibition; interaction; intoxication; SSRI; violence,alcohol; serotonin uptake inhibitor; antidepressant agent; serotonin uptake inhibitor; alcohol intoxication; alcoholism; Article; disease association; homicide; human; memory disorder; outcome assessment; violence; adult; alcohol intoxication; alcoholic beverage; drug interaction; female; male; Adult; Alcoholic Beverages; Alcoholic Intoxication; Antidepressive Agents; Drug Interactions; Female; Humans; Male; Serotonin Uptake Inhibitors,2-s2.0-84908285265

Unemployment rates are high and suitable support to return to work may not always be available. Motivational interviewing (MI) is a focused method of communication that was originally developed to assist counsellors in the treatment of problem drinking. However, more recent applications have demonstrated success with a variety of health conditions and problem behaviours. MI helps clients identify and change behaviours that may be preventing them from achieving optimal life goals, for instance, returning to paid employment.Content: This article gives an overview of the MI approach and highlights key research to date in the field. The vocational expectations of mental health service users and barriers to achieving them are examined. The potential for using MI in vocational rehabilitation with people living with mental ill health is then explored.Conclusions: A successful return to work can help people regain a lost sense of purpose and identity, which is crucial to achieving optimal life goals.

Courses had strict milestones that were subsequently adopted by the Structured Operational Research and Training InitiaTive (SORT IT) of the World Health Organization. We report on the numbers of enrolled participants who successfully completed courses, the number of papers published and their reported effect on policy and/or practice. Design: Retrospective cohort study including a survey. Methods: Participant selection criteria ensured that only those proposing specific programme-related and relevant operational research questions were selected. Effects on policy and/or practice were assessed in a standardised manner by two independent reviewers. Results: Of 93 enrolled participants from 31 countries (14 in Africa, 13 in Asia, two in Latin America and two in South Pacific), 83 (89%) completed their courses. A total of 96 papers were submitted to scientific journals of which 89 (93%) were published and 88 assessed for effect on policy and practice. There was a reported effect in 65 (74%) studies including changes to programme implementation (27), adaptation of monitoring tools (24) and changes to existing guidelines (20). Conclusion: Three quarters of published operational research studies from these structured courses had reported effects on policy and/or practice. It is important that this type of tracking becomes a standard component of operational research and research in general. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Capacity building; Impact; M?decins sans Fronti?res; Research; Structured Operational Research and Training IniTiative; Union,capacity building; cohort analysis; health policy; research work; World Health Organization; adaptation; Article; capacity building; cohort analysis; Fiji; France; health care policy; health care survey; human; India; Kenya; Luxembourg; medical education; Nepal; normal human; practice guideline; retrospective study; scientific literature; system analysis; article; desarrollo de capacidades; developing country; education; health care delivery; health care policy; health services research; impact; impacto; Investigaci?n; M?decins sans Fronti?res; MSF; publication; recherche; renforcement des capacit?s; research; SORT IT; Structured Operational Research and Training IniTiative; union; world health organization; Belgium; Fiji; France; Ile de France; India; Kenya; Luxembourg [Belgium]; Paris; Ville de Paris; trichloroethylene; capacity building; desarrollo de capacidades; impact; impacto; Investigaci?n; M?decins sans Fronti?res; MSF; recherche; renforcement des capacit?s; research; SORT IT; Structured Operational Research and Training IniTiative; tri; Union; UNION; Capacity Building; Cohort Studies; Delivery of Health Care; Developing Countries; Health Policy; Health Services Research; Humans; Operations Research; Publications; Research; Retrospective Studies; World Health Organization,2-s2.0-84907289845

The purpose of this study was to review the incidence of SDH in infants with congenital heart disease and explore the relationship between SDH and hypoxia.METHODS: Review of data collected for a prospective longitudinal cohort study of infants undergoing surgery for congenital heart disease in New Zealand and Australia. Infants underwent serial MRI scans of the brain in the first 3 months of life. All oxygen saturation recordings and MRI results were extracted and infants assigned to categories by degree of hypoxia. The data were then examined for any statistically significant relationship between hypoxia and SDH.RESULTS: One hundred fifty-two infants underwent MRI scans, and 66 (43%) had 145 loci of SDH. New SDH was seen in 12 infants after cardiac surgery. Of the loci of SDH, 63 (43%) were supratentorial, and most of these were interhemispheric, parietal, or temporal. SDH present on the first MRI persisted beyond 28 days of life in 8 infants. There was no demonstrable relationship between SDH and hypoxia.CONCLUSIONS: Asymptomatic SDH is common in young infants with congenital heart disease, at a frequency similar to that of those without congenital heart disease. These SDHs may occur in locations where they occur in abusive head trauma, but they are typically small and resolve within 3 months of birth.

Ma‾ori are the indigenous peoples of New Zealand. This study incorporated interpretive description (a qualitative methodology) within kaupapa Ma‾ori research (a Ma‾ori approach to research). In-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 11 Ma‾ori with aphasia and 23 of their nominated wha‾nau members. They reported a wide variety of experiences of aphasia therapy, in six themes: We're happy to do the work, but we can't do it alone; Relationship; Our worldview; The speech-language therapy setting; Aphasia resources; and Is this as good as it gets? While some Ma‾ori with aphasia reportedly received an accessible and culturally appropriate service, others did not. It is concluded that, for Ma‾ori with aphasia, a strong therapeutic relationship is central. The success of this relationship is shaped by the SLP's appreciation of the worldview of the person with aphasia and wha‾nau, the setting of the therapy, and the resources used. Successful therapy will involve collaboration between clinician and wha‾nau, and therapy resources that affirm the identity of the person with aphasia. ? 2014 The Speech Pathology Association of Australia Limited.",Aphasia; Qualitative; Speech-language pathology,aged; aphasia; female; health care delivery; human; male; middle aged; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; population group; procedures; speech disorder; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Aphasia; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Population Groups; Speech-Language Pathology,2-s2.0-84907061511

Results: 10 consecutive patients (mean age 23.6±7.5 years) were recruited. All were of Maori or Pacific Island Nations origin. All affected eyes exhibited extensive grade 3 acute corneal hydrops. Mean best corrected vision in hydrops eyes was 2/60 at presentation and 6/48 at resolution. Mean time to resolution of hydrops was 9.9±4.3 weeks. On IVCM, four corneas exhibited hyper-reflective round cells in the epithelium and stroma.

There is little research on the rate of use of CTOs in New Zealand. This study compares the prevalence of CTO use across New Zealand's 20 health districts and makes comparisons with international prevalence rates. Methods: New Zealand Ministry of Health reports provided data on rates of CTO use in New Zealand between 2005 and 2011. International rates were obtained from published reports and academic literature on CTO use. Results: Rates of CTO use in New Zealand show marked and persistent regional variation over the period of data collection. National average rates increased from 58 per 100,000 in 2005 to 84 per 100,000 in 2011. Rates of use of CTOs are increasing internationally. New Zealand's CTO use is high by international comparisons. Conclusions: New Zealand's high and increasing rate of CTO use by international standards raises questions about the delivery and functioning of mental health services, and about mental health service users' experience of mental health care. The high rate of CTO use needs to be addressed as a human rights issue as well as a clinical issue. ?

The aim of this study was to find the correlation between 2 of the most widely utilized classification systems (the Pirani score and the Dimeglio score) with number of Ponseti casts required to achieve initial clubfeet correction. METHODS:: A retrospective study of prospectively collected data was performed. All clubfeet assessed at our dedicated clubfoot clinic from January 2007 to December 2011 were included. Clubfoot severity was assessed using both the Pirani score and the Dimeglio score. The total number of casts was calculated from the first cast to the time of initiation of the foot abduction orthosis. RESULTS:: The mean number of Ponseti casts required to achieve initial correction was 5.8 (range, 2 to 10 casts). A low correlation (rs 0.21) was identified when the total Dimeglio score was compared with the number of casts. No correlation (rs 0.12) was identified between the Pirani score and the number of casts. CONCLUSIONS:: The Dimeglio and Pirani scores remain the most widely accepted clubfoot severity grading systems. However, their prognostic value remains questionable, at least in the early treatment stages.

So far, about 10 different OPG mutations have been described. The current study presents two novel OPG mutations in JPD patients. Patient 1 was diagnosed at the age of 9. months when he presented with inability to sit up, slow growth, marked bone pain and very high levels of serum alkaline phosphatase. Patient 2 presented a milder phenotype. He was initially diagnosed with osteogenesis imperfecta, and although he had numerous fractures and bone deformity, he was still independently mobile at the age of 19. years, when a diagnosis of JPD was confirmed. Sequence analysis of DNA samples from the patients determined two novel homozygous mutations in TNFSRF11B. Patient 1 (severe phenotype) had a large (245-251. kbp) homozygous deletion beginning in intron 1 that resulted in loss of 4 of the 5 exons of TNFSRF11B, including the whole ligand-binding domain. Patient 2 had a homozygous missense mutation resulting in a Thr. > Pro change in exon 2 of TNFSRF11B that is predicted to disrupt the OPG ligand-binding domain. Taken in conjunction with other published cases, these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the most severe phenotypes in JPD are seen in patients with major gene deletions or mutations affecting cysteine residues in the ligand-binding domain. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Genotype-phenotype; Rare bone diseases; Skeletal deformity,"25 hydroxyvitamin D; alkaline phosphatase; DNA; osteoprotegerin; pamidronic acid; vitamin D; osteoprotegerin; adult; alkaline phosphatase blood level; ankylosis; article; bone pain; bone turnover; brachycephaly; case report; child; clinical feature; developmental disorder; DNA extraction; drug dose increase; drug response; echography; femur malformation; fracture; gene; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic association; genotype; human; hydramnios; infant; irritability; kyphosis; long bone; male; motor dysfunction; neck malformation; nucleotide sequence; osteogenesis imperfecta; Paget bone disease; perception deafness; phenotype; physical examination; sequence analysis; thorax malformation; TNFRSF11B gene; Turkey (republic); United States; vitamin blood level; vitamin supplementation; female; gene deletion; genetics; homozygote; missense mutation; molecular genetics; Paget bone disease; pregnancy; preschool child; radiography; young adult; Adult; Base Sequence; Child, Preschool; Female; Gene Deletion; Homozygote; Humans; Infant; Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation, Missense; Osteitis Deformans; Osteoprotegerin; Pregnancy; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84905991513

Operative mortality (6.7 vs 2.0%, P = 0.012) and composite morbidity (27.7 vs 16.5%, P = 0.006) were also higher in patients with AF. After adjusting for significant variables, preoperative AF remained an independent predictor of operative mortality with an odds ratio of 3.44 (95% confidence interval 1.29-9.13), composite morbidity of 1.79 (1.05-3.04) and a mortality during follow-up hazards ratio of 2.36 (1.44-3.87). CONCLUSIONS AF was associated with several cardiovascular and cardiac surgery risk factors, but remained independently associated with short- and long-term mortality. AF should be incorporated into cardiac surgery risk models and surgical AF ablation may be considered with AVR. ? 2014 The Author 2014.

Oral diclofenac 1.0 mg·kg-1 is recommended for children aged 1-12 years. Analgesic effect from combination diclofenac/acetaminophen is unknown. Methods Children (n = 151) undergoing tonsillectomy (c. 1995) were randomized to receive acetaminophen elixir 40 mg·kg-1 before surgery and 20 mg·kg-1 rectally at the end of surgery with diclofenac suspension 0.1 mg·kg -1, 0.5 mg·kg-1, or 2.0 mg·kg-1 before surgery or placebo. A further 93 children were randomized to receive diclofenac 0.1 mg·kg-1, 0.5 mg·kg-1, or 2.0 mg·kg-1 only. Postoperative pain was assessed (visual analogue score, VAS 0-10) at half-hourly intervals from waking until discharge. Data were pooled with those from a further 222 children and 30 adults. One-compartment models with first-order absorption and elimination described the pharmacokinetics of both medicines. Combined drug effects were described using a modified EMAX model with an interaction term. An interval-censored model described the hazard of study dropout. Results Analgesia onset had an equilibration half-time of 0.496 h for acetaminophen and 0.23 h for diclofenac. The maximum effect (EMAX) was 4.9. The concentration resulting in 50% of EMAX (C50) was 1.23 mg·l-1 for diclofenac and 13.3 mg·l-1 for acetaminophen. A peak placebo effect of 6.8 occurred at 4 h. Drug effects were additive. The hazard of dropping out was related to pain (hazard ratio of 1.35 per unit change in pain). Diclofenac 1.0 mg·kg-1 with acetaminophen 15 mg·kg-1 achieves equivalent analgesia to acetaminophen 30 mg·kg-1. Conclusions Combination therapy can be used to achieve similar analgesia with lower doses of both drugs. ? 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.",analgesia; children; dropout model; drug interactions; drugs; pharmacodynamics; pharmacokinetics,"diclofenac; paracetamol; placebo; analgesic agent; diclofenac; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; paracetamol; analgesia; article; bioequivalence; child; compartment model; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug absorption; drug effect; drug elimination; elixir; human; major clinical study; pharmacodynamics; postoperative analgesia; postoperative pain; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; suspension; tonsillectomy; visual analog scale; dose response; drug combination; female; infant; male; pain measurement; Pain, Postoperative; preschool child; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Acetaminophen; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Child; Child, Preschool; Diclofenac; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Double-Blind Method; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Pain Measurement; Pain, Postoperative; Tonsillectomy; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84905591969

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this qualitative study was to understand the experience of people living with tophaceous gout, as the first step to developing a patient-reported Tophus Impact Questionnaire. METHODS: Twenty-five people with tophaceous gout (22 men; median age, 66 years; median gout disease duration, 26 years) participated in semistructured interviews that explored their experiences and perceptions of tophi. Interviews were recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were analyzed and coded to identify themes using content analysis. RESULTS: Three major interrelated themes arose from the interviews. The first theme was functional impact affecting body structures and functions (causing pain, restricted joint range of motion and deformity, and complications), and causing activity limitation and participation restriction (affecting day-to-day activities, leisure activities, employment participation, and family participation). The second theme was psychological impact including low self-esteem, embarrassment, resignation, but also optimism. The third theme was the lack of impact in some participants. CONCLUSIONS: Gouty tophi can have an important impact on many aspects of the patient's life. In addition to the impact of tophi on physical function, tophi may also influence social and psychological functioning. Capturing these aspects of the patient experience will be important in the development of a patient-reported outcome measure of tophus burden. ? 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Qualitative study; Quality of life; Tophaceous gout,"adult; arthropathy; article; clinical article; content analysis; daily life activity; disease duration; employment; female; gout; human; infection; joint function; leisure; male; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; optimism; patient participation; priority journal; qualitative research; quality of life; range of motion; self esteem; semi structured interview; tophaceous gout; tophus impact questionnaire; uric acid blood level; age; aged; Arthritis, Gouty; disability; disease course; gout; mental stress; middle aged; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; risk assessment; severity of illness index; sex difference; very elderly; antigout agent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthritis, Gouty; Disability Evaluation; Disease Progression; Female; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychology; Qualitative Research; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Risk Assessment; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Factors; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-84905079505

This study investigates outcomes for M?ori in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler therapy in asthma. Methods This 24-week multicentre RCT recruited 303 adult asthma patients, 44 of whom were M?ori. Participants were randomized to the single combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler as maintenance and reliever therapy ('SMART') regimen or 'standard' regimen (combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler for maintenance and salbutamol as reliever). Outcomes included patterns of beta-agonist inhaler use including 'high use' of reliever therapy (>8 actuations of budesonide/formoterol in excess of four maintenance doses per day for SMART and >16 actuations per day of salbutamol for standard). Differences in outcomes for M?ori versus non-M?ori were assessed using an interaction term between ethnicity and treatment. Results With adjustment for ethnicity, the SMART group had fewer days of high use (relative rate (RR) 0.57 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38-0.85)), days of high use without medical review within 48-h (RR 0.49 (95% CI: 0.32-0.75)) and severe exacerbations (RR 0.54 (95% CI: 0.36-0.81)) compared with standard. The magnitude of the benefit from the SMART regimen was similar in M?ori and non-M?ori. Regardless of treatment regimen, M?ori demonstrated more days of high use, high use without medical review and underuse of maintenance therapy. Conclusions The SMART regimen has a favourable risk/benefit profile in M?ori. Days of high use, days of high use without medical review and underuse of maintenance treatment were greater in M?ori, regardless of treatment regimen. This 24-week randomized controlled trial demonstrates that the single combination budesonide/formoterol inhaler as maintenance and reliever therapy (SMART) regimen has a favourable risk/benefit profile in M?ori, the indigenous people of New Zealand.

Some previous experimental studies have suggested that the HPV response to hypoxia is blunted in acute pulmonary embolism (APE), while others have concluded that HPV contributes to elevated pulmonary blood pressures in APE. To understand these contradictory observations, we have used a structure-based computational model of integrated lung function in 10 subjects to study the impact of HPV on pulmonary hemodynamics and gas exchange in the presence of regional arterial occlusion. The integrated model includes an experimentally-derived model for HPV. Its function is validated against measurements of pulmonary vascular resistance in normal subjects at four levels of inspired oxygen. Our results show that the apparently disparate observations of previous studies can be explained within a single model: the model predicts that HPV increases mean pulmonary artery pressure in APE (by 8.2 ± 7.0% in these subjects), and concurrently shows a reduction in response to hypoxia in the subjects who have high levels of occlusion and therefore maximal HPV in normoxia. ? 2014 Biomedical Engineering Society.",Computational model; Pulmonary blood flow; Vascular occlusion,"Biological organs; Blood pressure; Computational methods; Oxygen; Acute pulmonary embolisms; Adaptive response; Arterial occlusions; Computational model; Integrated modeling; Pulmonary artery; Pulmonary blood flow; Vascular occlusion; Hemodynamics; contrast medium; acute disease; acute pulmonary embolism; adult; article; blood flow; blood vessel occlusion; clinical article; cone beam computed tomography; cone beam computed tomography scanner; controlled study; experimental study; female; gas exchange; human; hypoxia; hypoxic lung vasoconstriction; lung artery pressure; lung embolism; lung function; lung hemodynamics; lung vascular resistance; lung ventilation perfusion ratio; male; measurement; priority journal; pulmonary artery occlusion; vasomotor reflex; animal; anoxia; arterial pressure; biological model; dog; lung circulation; lung embolism; lung gas exchange; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; pulmonary artery; vascular resistance; vasoconstriction; Adult; Animals; Anoxia; Arterial Pressure; Dogs; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Pulmonary Artery; Pulmonary Circulation; Pulmonary Embolism; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Vascular Resistance; Vasoconstriction",2-s2.0-84904397612

Disgust's elicitors are common in colorectal cancer (CRC) contexts and, because disgust evolved to minimise contamination risk through avoidance and withdrawal, decision making when disgusted is important. The current report investigated whether specific components of dispositional mindfulness predict elicited disgust and avoidance behaviours in scenarios based around CRC screening and treatment. After completing trait mindfulness measures, 80 healthy volunteers were block randomised (by gender) to disgust or control conditions before completing tasks assessing immediate avoidance of a disgust elicitor (stoma bag) and anticipated avoidance of a hypothetical CRC drug with disgusting side effects. Checks confirmed the manipulation of disgust (F(1,78) = 5.65, p &lt; .05, η p 2 = .07). As expected, those with greater non-judging mindfulness were less disgusted than people with lower mindfulness (F(1,74) = 4.70, p &lt; .05, η p 2 = .06). When disgusted however, mindfulness predicted greater anticipated avoidance: those high in the non-react facet were more likely to anticipate avoidance of the disgusting drug (Wald = 4.76, df = 1, p &lt; .05) odds ratio .24 (95 % CI 0.06-0.86), and immediately avoided touching the stoma bag (F(1,74) = 6.34, p &lt; .05). In total, these findings suggest persons with low mindfulness may fail to attend to emotional experience when making decisions while those higher in non-react and non-judge components may use their disgust to inform both current and future behaviour. Mindfulness training may promote more integrated decision-making skills in CRC contexts where disgust is a factor. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Avoidance; Colorectal cancer; Decision making; Disgust; Emotion; Mindfulness,,2-s2.0-84904106410

In previous studies we have shown that this is not classical insulin resistance but the drugs were actually inducing a hyperglycaemic state associated with elevated hepatic glucose output (HGO) and increased levels of glucagon and insulin. However, it remains unclear whether these effects are directly elicited by drug actions in the liver and pancreas, or whether they are indirectly mediated. Here we investigated if clozapine is capable of inducing insulin resistance in the liver or enhancing insulin and glucagon secretion from the pancreas. It was observed that insulin signalling was elevated in livers from animals treated with clozapine indicating there was no insulin resistance in the early steps of insulin signalling. To explore whether the defects arise at later stages of insulin action we used an isolated perfused liver system. In this model, clozapine had no direct effect on insulin's counter regulatory effect on epinephrine-induced HGO. In isolated mouse islets clozapine significantly increased glucose-stimulated insulin secretion while simultaneously blocking glucose-induced reductions in glucagon secretion. We also show that the non-peptidic glucagon receptor like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist Boc5 was able to overcome the inhibitory effects of clozapine on glucose metabolism. Taken together these results suggest that clozapine does not have any direct effect on glucose metabolism in the liver but it simultaneously stimulates insulin and glucagon secretion, a situation that would allow for the concurrent presence of high glucose and high insulin levels in treated animals. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Clozapine; Diabetes; Insulin signalling; Schizophrenia,"adrenalin; boc5; clozapine; glucagon; glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonist; insulin; unclassified drug; adrenalin; adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; antidiabetic agent; Boc5 compound; clozapine; cyclobutane derivative; glucagon; glucagon receptor; glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor; glucose; insulin; neuroleptic agent; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; glucagon release; glucose blood level; glucose intolerance; glucose metabolism; hepatic glucose output; in vivo study; insulin blood level; insulin release; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; male; metabolic parameters; nonhuman; oral glucose tolerance test; pancreas islet; priority journal; rat; signal transduction; treatment outcome; agonists; animal; drug effects; glucose tolerance test; liver; metabolism; pancreas; secretion (process); Sprague Dawley rat; tissue culture technique; Animals; Antipsychotic Agents; Clozapine; Cyclobutanes; Epinephrine; Glucagon; Glucose; Glucose Tolerance Test; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Liver; Male; Pancreas; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Glucagon; Sympathomimetics; Tissue Culture Techniques",2-s2.0-84904095257

Previous authors have discussed the presence of tooth avulsions in several individuals recovered from Roonka, but those papers did not examine any patterns in those removals that might be present. Analysis of the tooth avulsions at Roonka reveals a change in the practice over time, with the older burials from phase II typically showing removal of both maxillary central incisors with a left side bias when only one tooth is removed, and the more recent phase III burials showing only one incisor avulsed and a right side bias for removal. Frequencies in the practice also changed over time, with avulsions being much more common in the older phase II burials. Historical evidence suggests that any particular regional or social group would have its own particular pattern of tooth avulsion, so these changes in tooth avulsions at Roonka suggest that the site was either used by multiple groups of people for burials, or that there was significant cultural change during the occupation of the site. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Australia; dental modification; Holocene; Murray River,"article; body modification; enamel; esthetics; history; human; human tissue; incisor; maxillary central incisor; periodontal disease; posthumous care; ritual; tooth abscess; tooth extraction; tooth injury; Australia; body modification; ethnology; male; pathology; physical anthropology; tooth injury; Anthropology, Physical; Australia; Body Modification, Non-Therapeutic; Burial; Humans; Incisor; Male; Tooth Avulsion",2-s2.0-84903982136

Methods and Results-The study included 4231 participants from 3 CHARGE cohorts: the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, the Cardiovascular Health Study, and the Framingham Heart Study. We used a case-cohort design in which we selected both a random sample of participants and participants with extreme phenotypes for each of 14 traits. We sequenced and analyzed 77 genomic loci, which had previously been associated with ?1 of 14 phenotypes. A total of 52 736 variants were characterized by sequencing and passed our stringent quality control criteria. For common variants (minor allele frequency ?1%), we performed unweighted regression analyses to obtain P values for associations and weighted regression analyses to obtain effect estimates that accounted for the sampling design. For rare variants, we applied 2 approaches: collapsed aggregate statistics and joint analysis of variants using the sequence kernel association test. Conclusions-We sequenced 77 genomic loci in participants from 3 cohorts. We established a set of filters to identify high-quality variants and implemented statistical and bioinformatics strategies to analyze the sequence data and identify potentially functional variants within genome-wide association study loci. ? 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",Epidemiology; Genetics; Sampling studies,"aging; article; controlled study; gene frequency; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic epidemiology; genetic variability; genomics; heart disease; human; major clinical study; phenotype; priority journal; sequence analysis; study design; adult; aged; aging; cohort analysis; DNA sequence; female; genetic association; genetics; genomics; Heart Diseases; male; methodology; middle aged; single nucleotide polymorphism; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Cohort Studies; Female; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Heart Diseases; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Research Design; Sequence Analysis, DNA",2-s2.0-84903608791

To expand the structure-activity relationship of this compound class towards both parasites, we have prepared and biologically tested a library of analogues that includes indoleglyoxyl and indoleacetic ""capping acids"", and polyamines including spermine (PA3-4-3) and extended analogues PA3-8-3 and PA3-12-3. 7-Methoxy substituted indoleglyoxylamides were typically found to exhibit the most potent antimalarial activity (IC50 10-92 nM) but with varying degrees of selectivity versus the L6 rat myoblast cell line. A 6-methoxyindolglyoxylamide analogue was the most potent growth inhibitor of T. brucei (IC50 0.18 μM) identified in the study: it, however, also exhibited poor selectivity (L6 IC50 6.0 μM). There was no apparent correlation between antimalarial and anti-T. brucei activity in the series.

Our aim was to define the current variation by ethnicity in investigation, revascularisation and pharmacotherapy after admission with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Methods Data from consecutive New Zealand residents <80 years of age admitted to the Middlemore Hospital coronary care unit with ACS (2007 to 2012) were collected prospectively. Results Of 2666 ACS patients <80y, 51.5% were European/Other, 14.2% Maori, 16.0% Pacific, 14.8% Indian, and 3.5% Asian. Cardiac risk factors and comorbidity varied markedly by ethnicity. The overall coronary angiography rate was high (89%). After adjustment for clinical factors which influence the decision to perform angiography, European/Other patients were about 5% more likely than Maori and Pacific patients to have angiography. Overall revascularisation was highest in Asian, Indian and European/Other (76.1%, 69.1% and 68.6%), and lower in Maori and Pacific patients (58.2% and 52.9%). Nonobstructive coronary disease was more common in Maori and Pacific (20.6 and 18.6%, respectively), than in European/Other, Indian and Asian patients (13.3%, 8.7% and 6.1%). After adjustment, Maori, Indian and Asian patients were as likely to receive revascularisation as European/Others, but revascularisation in Pacific patients was 13% lower. Discharge prescribing of triple preventive therapy was uniformly high across ethnic groups (overall 91%). Conclusions There is a small unexplained variation in angiography rates across ethnic groups. Much of the observed variation in revascularisation may be due to differences in the coronary artery disease phenotype. ?NZMA.",,"acetylsalicylic acid plus clopidogrel; aldosterone antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; hemoglobin A1c; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; acute coronary syndrome; adult; angiocardiography; Article; assessment of humans; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; contrast induced nephropathy; coronary artery bypass graft; diabetes mellitus; ethnicity; European; female; Global Registry of ACS score; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart muscle revascularization; heart rate; human; Indian; lung edema; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); microalbuminuria; middle aged; mortality; New Zealand; obesity; percutaneous coronary intervention; prophylaxis; prospective study; risk factor; smoking; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; United States; acute coronary syndrome; aged; article; coronary artery bypass graft; ethnic group; ethnology; methodology; New Zealand; postoperative complication; register; statistics; transluminal coronary angioplasty; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Aged; Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary; Coronary Angiography; Coronary Artery Bypass; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Postoperative Complications; Prospective Studies; Registries; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-84903194169

Notably, maternal and progeny plasma S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) levels are both elevated after vitamin deficiency in pregnancy. Therefore, we investigated whether this key one-carbon cycle intermediate directly affects adipocyte differentiation and function. We found that expansion and differentiation of murine 3T3-L1 preadipocytes in the presence of SAH impaired both basal and induced glucose uptake as well as lipolysis compared with untreated controls. SAH did not alter preadipocyte factor 1 (Dlk1) or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ 2 (Pparγ2) but significantly reduced expression of CAAT enhancer-binding protein-α (Cebpα), Cebpβ, and retinoid x receptor-α (Rxrα) compared with untreated adipocytes. SAH increased Rxrα methylation on a CpG unit (chr2: 27,521,057+, chr2:27,521,049+) and CpG residue (chr2: 27,521,080+), but not Cebpβ methylation, relative to untreated adipocytes. Trimethylated histone H3-Lys27 occupancy was significantly increased on Cebpα and Rxr a promoters in SAH-treated adipocytes, consistent with the reduction in gene expression. In conclusion, SAH did not affect adipogenesis per se but altered adipocyte functionality through epigenetic mechanisms, such that they exhibited altered glucose disposal and lipolysis. Our findings implicate micronutrient imbalance in subsequent modulation of adipocyte function. ? 2014 by the American Diabetes Association.",,"CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha; CCAAT enhancer binding protein beta; histone H3; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma 2; preadipocyte factor 1; protein; retinoid X receptor alpha; s adenosylhomocysteine; unclassified drug; adipocyte; animal cell; article; carbon cycle; cell differentiation; cell expansion; cell function; controlled study; epigenetics; gene expression; glucose transport; lipolysis; methylation; nonhuman; priority journal; proadipocyte; promoter region; protein expression; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; Carbon Cycle; CCAAT-Enhancer-Binding Proteins; DNA Methylation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression; Genetic Markers; Glucose; Mice; PPAR gamma; S-Adenosylhomocysteine",2-s2.0-84903140442

Optimizing fetal growth to improve both neonatal survival and population health is the focus of much research and policy development, although most efforts have concentrated on either the period of pregnancy itself or the period immediately preceding it.Methods: Intergenerational data linked to the Aberdeen Children of the 1950s (ACONF) study were used to examine the influence of grandparental and parental life course biological and social variables on the distribution of offspring size at birth. Guided stepwise multivariable methods and a graphical approach were used to assess the relative importance of these temporally ordered and highly correlated life course measures.Results: Both distal and proximal grandparental and parental life course biological and social factors predicted offspring size at birth. Inequalities in size at birth, according to adult maternal socioeconomic indicators, were found to be largely generated by the continuity of the social environment across generations, and the inequalities in maternal early life growth were predicted by the adult grandparental social environment during the mother's early life. Mother's own size at birth predicted her offspring's intrauterine growth, independent of her adult biological and social characteristics.Conclusions: A mother's childhood social environment and her early growth are both important predictors of her offspring's size at birth. Population strategies aimed at optimizing size at birth require broader social and intergenerational considerations, in addition to focusing on the health of mothers in the immediate pregnancy period. ?

However, most compassion research focuses on compassion fatigue-an outcome variable- rather than examining the specific factors that may interfere with compassion in a physician's practice. This report describes the development and early psychometric data for a self-report questionnaire assessing barriers to compassion among physicians. Methods In 2011, a pilot sample of 75 physicians helped to generate an initial list of barriers to compassion. A final 34 item Barriers to Physician Compassion (BPC) questionnaire was administered to 372 convenience-sampled physicians together with measures of demographics, practice-related variables, stress, locus of control and trait compassion. Results The barriers to physician compassion were not one-dimensional. Principal component analysis revealed the presence of four distinct, face-valid and discriminable factors-physician burnout/overload, external distractions, difficult patient/family and complex clinical situation. All barrier components had adequate internal reliabilities (>0.70) and meaningful patterns of convergent and divergent validity. Conclusions Remaining compassionate in medical practice is difficult. With the newly developed BPC questionnaire, specific barriers to compassion can be assessed.

It has long been recognized that the sequential contact between the tongue and the palate plays a crucial role in the oropharyngeal phase of swallowing. However, because the focus of most research on intraoral pressure has been on the generation of positive pressure by the tongue on the hard palate and teeth, generation and coordination of absolute intraoral pressures and regional pressure gradients has remained unexplored. Ongoing research in our laboratory has uncovered highly variable individual pressure patterns during swallowing, which can nonetheless be divided into four stages: preparatory, primary propulsive, intermediate and terminal. These stages may further be sub-classified according to pressure patterns generated at the individual level as tipper or dipper patterns in the preparatory stage, roller or slapper in the primary propulsive and monophasic or biphasic during the intermediate stage. Interestingly, while an increase in bolus viscosity can result in significant changes to pressure patterns in some individuals, it has little effect in others. Highly individual responses to increased viscosity are also observed with swallowing duration. The above, together with other findings, have important implications for our understanding of the aetiology of widely differing conditions such as protrusive and retrusive malocclusions, dysphagia and sleep apnoea, as well as the development of novel food products. ? 2013 Australian Dental Association.",dysphagia; intraoral pressure; Swallowing; tongue; tongue thrust,adult; article; dysphagia; female; histology; human; incisor; intraoral pressure; male; mandible; mouth; physiology; pressure; swallowing; tongue; tongue thrust; dysphagia; intraoral pressure; Swallowing; tongue; tongue thrust; Adult; Deglutition; Female; Humans; Incisor; Male; Mandible; Mouth; Pressure; Tongue,2-s2.0-84902086389

Setting: Stakeholders from a broad range of healthcare and policy institutions including primary, secondary and tertiary care. Participants: Exploratory, semistructured interviews were conducted with 20 stakeholders throughout New Zealand. Primary and secondary outcome measures: The interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and coded into INVIVO 10, then compared and grouped for similarity of theme. Perceptions, experiences and opinions regarding New Zealand's medicines policy issues were recorded. Results: A large proportion of stakeholders appeared to be unaware of New Zealand's (NZ) medicines policy. In general, the policy was considered to offer consistency to guide decision-making. In the context of Pharmaceutical Management Agency's (PHARMAC's) fixed budget for procuring and subsidising medicines, there was reasonable satisfaction with the range of medicines available - rare disorder medicines being the clear exception. Concerns raised were by whom and how decisions are made and whether desired health outcomes are being measured. Other concerns included inconsistencies in evidence and across health technologies. Despite attempts to improve the situation, lower socioeconomic groups (including rural residents) M?ori and Pacific ethnicities and people with rare disorders face challenges with regards to accessing medicines. Other barriers include, convenience to and affordability of prescribers and the increase of prescription fees from NZ$3 to NZ$5. Concerns related to the PHARMAC of New Zealand included: a constraining budget; non-transparency of in-house analysis; lack of consistency in recommendations between the Pharmacology and Therapeutics Advisory Committee. Constraints and inefficiencies also exist in the submission process to access high-cost medicines. Conclusions: The results suggest reasonable satisfaction with the availability of subsidised medicines.

METHODS-: We used a time-stratified case-crossover study design to analyze individual participant and daily geomagnetic activity (as measured by Ap Index) data from several large population-based stroke incidence studies (with information on 11 453 patients with stroke collected during 16 031 764 person-years of observation) in New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, France, and Sweden conducted between 1981 and 2004. Hazard ratios and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. RESULTS-: Overall, geomagnetic storms (Ap Index 60+) were associated with 19% increase in the risk of stroke occurrence (95% CI, 11%-27%). The triggering effect of geomagnetic storms was most evident across the combined group of all strokes in those aged <65 years, increasing stroke risk by >50%: moderate geomagnetic storms (60-99 Ap Index) were associated with a 27% (95% CI, 8%-48%) increased risk of stroke occurrence, strong geomagnetic storms (100-149 Ap Index) with a 52% (95% CI, 19%-92%) increased risk, and severe/extreme geomagnetic storms (Ap Index 150+) with a 52% (95% CI, 19%-94%) increased risk (test for trend, P<2×10). CONCLUSIONS-: Geomagnetic storms are associated with increased risk of stroke and should be considered along with other established risk factors. Our findings provide a framework to advance stroke prevention through future investigation of the contribution of geomagnetic factors to the risk of stroke occurrence and pathogenesis. ? 2014 American Heart Association, Inc.",environment; stroke,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; atmospheric pressure; Australia; cerebrovascular accident; crossover procedure; disease association; environmental temperature; female; France; geographic and geological phenomena; geomagnetic storm; human; humidity; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; population research; priority journal; risk factor; Sweden; United Kingdom; weather; environment; stroke; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Australia; Europe; Female; Humans; Magnetic Phenomena; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stroke",2-s2.0-84901950598

Gestational age at delivery was 36.1 ± 5.1 weeks for nifedipine and 36.8 ± 3.6 weeks for placebo (P = 0.027). Length of NICU admission [median (interquartile ranges, IQR)] was 27 (24-41) days and 16 (8-37) days in nifedipine and placebo groups, respectively (P = 0.17).

Conventional screening does not recognize up to 20% of BCVI patients. To improve diagnosis of BCVI, both an expanded battery of screening criteria and a multi-detector computed tomography angiography (CTA) have been suggested. The aim of this study is to investigate whether the use of CTA restricted to the Denver protocol screen-positive patients would reduce the unnecessary use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool. Methods: This is a registry-based study of blunt trauma patients admitted to Auckland City Hospital from 1998 to 2012. The diagnosis of BCVI was confirmed or excluded with CTA, magnetic resonance angiography and, if these imaging were non-conclusive, four-vessel digital subtraction angiography. Results: Thirty (61%) BCVI and 19 (39%) non-BCVI patients met eligibility criteria. The Denver protocol applied to our cohort of patients had a sensitivity of 97% (95% confidence interval (CI): 83-100%) and a specificity of 42% (95% CI: 20-67%). With a prevalence of BCVI in blunt trauma patients of 0.2% and 2.7%, post-test odds of a screen-positive test were 0.03 (95% CI: 0.002-0.005) and 0.046 (95% CI: 0.314-0.068), respectively. Conclusions: Application of the CTA to the Denver protocol screen-positive trauma patients can decrease the use of CTA as a pre-emptive screening tool by 95-97% and reduces its hazards. ? 2013 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.",Blunt cerebrovascular injury; Screening; Validity,"adult; angiography; Australia; Cerebrovascular Trauma; comparative study; confidence interval; female; human; injury scale; magnetic resonance angiography; male; mass screening; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; procedures; register; retrospective study; utilization; Wounds, Nonpenetrating; young adult; Adult; Angiography; Australia; Cerebrovascular Trauma; Confidence Intervals; Female; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Multidetector Computed Tomography; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Wounds, Nonpenetrating; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84901825595

The present cohort study was performed to confirm clinical effectiveness of radiologic insertion in everyday practice, including insertion in patients with expanded eligibility criteria and by fellows in training. Materials and Methods Between 2004 and 2009, 286 PD catheters were inserted in 249 patients, 133 with fluoroscopic guidance in the radiology department and 153 by laparoscopic surgery. Survival analyses were performed with the primary outcome of complication-free catheter survival and secondary outcomes of overall catheter survival and patient survival. Outcomes were assessed at last follow-up, as long as 365 days after PD catheter insertion. Results In the radiologic group, unadjusted 365-day complication-free catheter, overall catheter, and patient survival rates were 22.6%, 81.2%, and 82.7%, respectively, compared with 22.9% (P =.52), 76.5% (P =.4), and 92.8% (P =.01), respectively, in the laparoscopic group. Frequencies of individual complications were similar between groups. Adjusting for patient age, comorbidity, and previous PD catheter, the hazard ratio (HR) for catheter complications by radiologic versus laparoscopic insertion is 0.90 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62-1.31); the HR for overall catheter survival is 1.25 (95% CI, 0.59-2.65); and that for death is 2.47 (95% CI, 0.84-7.3). Conclusions Radiologic PD catheter insertion is a clinically effective alternative to laparoscopic surgery, although there was poorer long-term survival with radiologic catheter placement, possibly because of preferential selection of radiologic insertion for more frail patients. ? 2014 SIR.",,"adult; age; aged; article; body mass; catheter complication; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; comorbidity; death; end stage renal disease; female; fluoroscopy; follow up; human; laparoscopic surgery; long term survival; major clinical study; male; medical record review; outcome assessment; peritoneal dialysis; peritoneal dialysis catheter; priority journal; radiology department; retrospective study; survival rate; catheterization; comparative study; disease free survival; fluoroscopy; indwelling catheter; interventional radiology; Kidney Failure, Chronic; laparoscopy; middle aged; mortality; peritoneal dialysis; register; risk factor; time; treatment outcome; Aged; Catheterization; Catheters, Indwelling; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Fluoroscopy; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Peritoneal Dialysis; Radiography, Interventional; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84901597228

We examined how political changes have impacted on the work of health promoters through qualitative research with individuals working in the health promotion sector. Interviews and focus groups were undertaken between January 2008 and March 2009. Caught in a neoliberally influenced drive to increase the efficiency of the health sector, health promotion in New Zealand has been subject to considerable changes in the funding and provision of services. Characterised by a growth in limited-term contracts with constrained budgets, health promoters have responded to fiscal limitations by pooling resources. We find that rather than being uncritical agents of the government's health promotion agenda, health promoters often became advocates of the community's agenda, occupying a 'grey space' where the demands of contracts create tension with their commitments to communities. Any portrayal of health promotion must acknowledge the contested nature of the spaces of governance health promoters occupy and resist reducing them to uncritical agents of the state. ? 2013 Taylor & Francis.",health promotion; healthism; neoliberalism; new public health; New Zealand; workforce,article; community; disease exacerbation; disease surveillance; economic aspect; funding; health care cost; health care system; health program; health promotion; health survey; human; neoliberalism; New Zealand; organization and management; politics; program effectiveness; public health; public-private partnership; qualitative research; social behavior,2-s2.0-84901596037

We investigated whether marasmus survivors (MS) are more insulin resistant and glucose intolerant than kwashiorkor survivors (KS). Research Design and Setting: This was a case-control study in Jamaican adults. Subjects: We performed oral glucose tolerance tests on 191 adults (aged 17-50 y; 52% male; body mass index 24.2±5.5 kg/m 2). There were 43 MS; 38 KS; 70 age-, sex-, and body mass index-matched community controls; and 40 age- and birth weight-matched controls. Measurements: We measured insulin sensitivity with the whole-body insulin sensitivity index, and β-cell function with the insulinogenic index and the oral disposition index. Results: Fasting glucose was comparable across groups, but glucose intolerance was significantly more common in MS (19%) than in KS (3%), community controls (11%), and birth weight-matched controls (10%). The whole-body insulin sensitivity index was lower in MS than KS (P = .06) but similar between MS and controls. The insulinogenic index and oral disposition index were lower in MS compared with all three groups (P &lt; .01). Conclusions: Marasmus survivors tend to be less insulin sensitive, but have significantly lower insulin secretion and are more glucose intolerant compared with kwashiorkor survivors and controls. This suggests that poor nutrition in early life causes -cell dysfunction, which may predispose to the development of diabetes. ? 2014 by the Endocrine Society.",,acute disease; adolescent; adult; article; birth weight; body mass; case control study; controlled study; disease severity; female; glucose intolerance; glucose metabolism; human; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; Jamaica; kwashiorkor; major clinical study; male; marasmus; nutritional assessment; nutritional health; oral glucose tolerance test; pancreas islet beta cell; priority journal; survivor; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Glucose; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Jamaica; Male; Malnutrition; Middle Aged; Severity of Illness Index; Survivors; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84901487176

In this study, we evaluated the immune responses elicited in BALB/c mice by nasal immunisation with recombinant T. gondii receptor for activated C kinase 1 (r. TgRACK1) and their protective efficacy against T. gondii RH strain during both chronic and lethal infections. Nasal vaccination with r. TgRACK1 increased the level of secretory IgA in nasal, intestinal and vesical washes, and the level of IFN-γ and IL-2 in intestinal washes, indicating that r. TgRACK1 vaccination promotes mucosal immune responses. The mice immunised with r. TgRACK1 also displayed increased levels of r. TgRACK1-specific IgA, total IgG, IgG1 and in particular IgG2a in their blood sera, increased production of IFN-γ, IL-2 and IL-4 but not IL-10 from their isolated spleen cells, and enhanced splenocyte proliferation in vitro. r. TgRACK1-vaccinated mice were effectively protected against infection with T. gondii RH strain, showing over 50% reduction of tachyzoite burdens in their liver and brain tissues during a chronic infection, and also a 45% increase in their survivals during a lethal challenge.

Whether the time of onset or the severity of preeclampsia in a first pregnancy is associated with the incidence of recurrent preeclampsia is not clear. We performed a retrospective study to analyse the incidence of recurrent preeclampsia and associations of the time of onset and the severity of preeclampsia between first preeclampsia and recurrent preeclampsia. Study design Ninety-two women with previous preeclampsia who had a second pregnancy in a 4 year period were included. Data on the first and second pregnancies were obtained and included maternal age, maternal height and weight, gestation week at onset of preeclampsia and at delivery, blood pressure, proteinuria, interval between pregnancies and birth weights. Results Fifty-five women with previous preeclampsia developed recurrent preeclampsia (59.8%). The difference in the incidence of recurrent early and late onset preeclampsia was not significant different (65.3% versus 53.4%, p > 0.05). The difference in the incidence of mild or severe disease in those who experienced recurrent preeclampsia was also not significant (59.6% versus 60%, p > 0.05). The severity of preeclampsia in second pregnancy was not associated with the severity of preeclampsia in first pregnancy. However 93.7% women with previous early onset preeclampsia developed early onset preeclampsia in second pregnancy and 56.5% women with previous late onset preeclampsia developed early onset preeclampsia in second pregnancy. In addition, 76.2% women with previous mild preeclampsia developed severe preeclampsia in second pregnancy. The baby weight in recurrent preeclampsia was significantly decreased compared to that in first pregnancy with preeclampsia. Conclusion Our data demonstrate that there was no association between the incidence of recurrent preeclampsia and the time of onset or severity of preeclampsia in first pregnancy. But our data here may suggest that women with early onset preeclampsia in first pregnancy are more likely to experience early onset preeclampsia in second pregnancy. The severity of recurrent preeclampsia is increased regardless the severity in first pregnancy. ? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",China; Preeclampsia; Recurrent preeclampsia; Severity; Time of onset,adult; article; cesarean section; China; clinical article; diastolic blood pressure; disease severity; female; gestational age; human; incidence; maternal age; multigravida; outcomes research; preeclampsia; pregnancy; pregnant woman; primigravida; priority journal; proteinuria; recurrent disease; stillbirth; systolic blood pressure; vaginal delivery; adolescent; birth weight; body mass; family planning; gestational age; pathophysiology; preeclampsia; pregnancy; retrospective study; severity of illness index; time; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Birth Intervals; Birth Weight; Body Mass Index; Female; Gestational Age; Gravidity; Humans; Pre-Eclampsia; Pregnancy; Recurrence; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84901029015

Methods Bivariable and multivariable analyses were performed using the Breast Quality Audit database of Breast Surgeons of Australia and New Zealand. Results Multivariable regression indicated that patients from lower socioeconomic areas are more likely to live in more remote areas and to be treated at regional than major city centres. Although they appeared equally likely to be referred to surgeons from BreastScreen services as patients from higher socioeconomic areas, they were less likely to be referred as asymptomatic cases from other sources. In general, their cancer and treatment characteristics did not differ from those of women from higher socioeconomic areas, but ovarian ablation therapy was less common for these patients and bilateral synchronous lesions tended to be less frequent than for women from higher socioeconomic areas. Conclusions The results indicate that patients from lower socioeconomic areas are more likely to live in more remote districts and have their treatment in regional rather than major treatment centres.

What is known about this topic? It is already known from Australian data that breast cancer outcomes are not as favourable for women from areas of socioeconomic disadvantage. The reasons for the poorer outcomes have not been understood. Studies in other countries have also found poorer outcomes in women from lower socioeconomic areas, and in some instances, have attributed this finding to more advanced stages of cancers at diagnosis and more limited treatment. The reasons are likely to vary with the country and health system characteristics. What does this paper add? The present study found that in Australia, women from lower socioeconomic areas do not have more advanced cancers at diagnosis, nor, in general, other cancer features that would predispose them to poorer outcomes. The standout differences were that they tended more to live in areas that were more remote from specialist metropolitan centres and were more likely to be treated in regional settings where prior research has indicated poorer outcomes. The reasons for these poorer outcomes are not known but may include lower levels of surgical specialisation, less access to specialised adjunctive services, and less involvement with multidisciplinary teams. Women from lower socioeconomic areas also appeared more likely to attend lower case load surgeons. Little difference was evident in the type of clinical care received, although women from lower socioeconomic areas were less likely to be asymptomatic referrals from other clinical settings (excluding BreastScreen). What are the implications for practitioners? Results suggest that poorer outcomes in women from lower socioeconomic areas in Australia may have less to do with the characteristics of their breast cancers or treatment modalities and more to do with health system features, such as access to specialist centres. This study highlights the importance of demographic and health system features as potentially key factors in service outcomes. Health system research should be strengthened in Australia to augment biomedical and clinical research, with a view to best meeting service needs of all sectors of the population. ?

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) could improve hypoglycemia detection, while reducing blood glucose (BG) measurements. Calibration algorithms use BG measurements to convert sensor signals into CGM data. Thus, inaccuracies in calibration BG measurements directly affect CGM values and any metrics calculated from them. The aim was to quantify the effect of timing delays and calibration BG measurement errors on hypoglycemia metrics in newborn infants. Data from 155 babies were used. Two timing and 3 BG meter error models (Abbott Optium Xceed, Roche Accu-Chek Inform II, Nova Statstrip) were created using empirical data. Monte-Carlo methods were employed, and each simulation was run 1000 times. Each set of patient data in each simulation had randomly selected timing and/or measurement error added to BG measurements before CGM data were calibrated. The number of hypoglycemic events, duration of hypoglycemia, and hypoglycemic index were then calculated using the CGM data and compared to baseline values. Timing error alone had little effect on hypoglycemia metrics, but measurement error caused substantial variation. Abbott results underreported the number of hypoglycemic events by up to 8 and Roche overreported by up to 4 where the original number reported was 2. Nova results were closest to baseline. Similar trends were observed in the other hypoglycemia metrics. Errors in blood glucose concentration measurements used for calibration of CGM devices can have a clinically important impact on detection of hypoglycemia. If CGM devices are going to be used for assessing hypoglycemia it is important to understand of the impact of these errors on CGM data. ? 2014 Diabetes Technology Society.",Algorithm; Continuous glucose monitor; Hypoglycemia; Intensive care unit; Neonatal; Recalibration,"glucose; biological marker; glucose blood level; article; blood glucose meter; blood glucose monitoring; calibration; disease duration; glucose blood level; glucose sensor; gold standard; hematocrit; human; human tissue; hypoglycemia; large for gestational age; major clinical study; maternal diabetes mellitus; measurement accuracy; measurement error; newborn; newborn intensive care; point of care testing; algorithm; blood; calibration; computer simulation; devices; equipment design; hypoglycemia; metabolism; Monte Carlo method; physiologic monitoring; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; standard; standards; time factor; Algorithms; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Calibration; Computer Simulation; Equipment Design; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Infant, Newborn; Monitoring, Physiologic; Monte Carlo Method; Predictive Value of Tests; Reference Standards; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84900810008

The revised EuroSCORE II and the AusSCORE, based on an Australasian population, were recently developed. We compared the prognostic utility of these four scores for mortality as well as morbidity in patients undergoing isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Methods: The scores were retrospectively calculated for isolated CABG patients at Auckland City Hospital during July 2010-June 2012. Discrimination and calibration of outcomes were assessed. Results: 818 patients were followed for 1.6+/-0.6 years. Mortality at 30 days was 1.6% and 2.9% on follow up. Median predicted 30 day mortality (Interquartile range) for EuroSCORE I were 2.8% (1.6%, 5.2%), EuroSCORE II 1.6% (1.0%, 2.8%), STS Score 2.3% (1.3%, 4.5%) and AusSCORE 0.5% (0.2%, 1.1%). C-statistics and Hosmer-Lemeshow test p-values for these scores for 30-day mortality were Euro score I 0.675 (95%CI 0.531-0.819)/0.061, EuroSCORE II 0.642 (0.503-0.780)/0.150, STS Score 0.641 (0.507-0.775)/0.243 and AusSCORE 0.661 (0.516-0.807)/0.420.Only EuroSCORE I and STS scores were significant for predicting mortality at follow-up (c. = 0.639 and 0.666). All scores predicted composite morbidity. C-statistics were EuroSCORE I 0.678, EuroSCORE II 0.634, STS score 0.584 and AusSCORE 0.645. Conclusion: EuroSCORE II, STS Score and AusSCORE had slightly improved calibration but similar discrimination for 30-day mortality compared to EuroSCORE I.Revision of risk models to fit contemporary surgical outcomes is important, but there may only be modest room for improvement in discrimination. ? 2013 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ).",Cardiac surgery; Coronary artery bypass grafting; EuroSCORE; Risk models,accuracy; adult; article; AusSCORE; calibration; cause of death; coronary artery bypass graft; EuroSCORE I; EuroSCORE II; female; follow up; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; mortality; outcome assessment; priority journal; prognosis; retrospective study; scoring system; Society of Thoracic Surgeon Score; survival rate; survival time; aged; Australia; clinical trial; comparative study; coronary artery bypass graft; disease free survival; epidemiology; middle aged; mortality; procedures; risk factor; time; Aged; Australia; Coronary Artery Bypass; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Time Factors,2-s2.0-84899948147

The aim of this study was to determine whether zoledronate, a potent antiosteoclast drug, influences bone erosion in people with tophaceous gout. Methods: This was a 2-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 100 people with tophaceous gout. Participants were randomised to annual administration of 5 mg intravenous zoledronate or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in the foot CT bone erosion score from baseline. Secondary endpoint was change in plain radiographic damage scores. Other endpoints were change in bone mineral density (BMD), bone turnover markers and the OMERACT-endorsed core domains for chronic gout studies. Results: There was no change in CT erosion scores over 2 years, and no difference between the two treatment groups at Year 1 or 2 (p(treat)=0.10, p(time)=0.47, p (treat*time)=0.23). Similarly, there was no change in plain radiographic scores over 2 years, and no difference between the two groups at Year 1 or 2. By contrast, zoledronate increased spine, neck of femur, total hip and total body BMD. Zoledronate therapy also reduced the bone turnover markers P1NP and β-CTX compared with placebo. There was no difference between treatment groups in OMERACT-endorsed core domains. Conclusions: Despite improvements in BMD and suppression of bone turnover markers, antiosteoclast therapy with zoledronate did not influence bone erosion in people with tophaceous gout.

Hollow chitosan beads were prepared using a solvent free, ionotropic gelation method. The effect of formulation parameters, including chitosan molecular weight and drug concentration, on bead characteristics was studied. The drug containing formulations had yields >70.5 ± 0.31%. The entrapment efficiencies for the medium molecular weight chitosan formulations (56.29 ± 0.94%-62.75 ± 0.86%) was greater than the high molecular weight chitosan formulation (29.21 ± 0.89%). The density of all formulations was below that of gastric fluid, the greatest density observed was 0.60 ± 0.01 g cm-3. Unsurprisingly, the formulations were immediate bouyant to different degrees in both pH 1.2 and pH 6.8 media. In addition, the chitosan beads were all seen to swell in pH 1.2 media and demonstrated mucoadhesive properties. A sustained release profile was observed from the chitosan beads, the developed formulations released drug at slower rates than a marketed ACV oral tablet.

Barriers to translation of fractional anisotropy measures into routine clinical practice include the time required for manually delineating volumes of interest (VOIs), and inter-examiner variability in this process. This study investigated whether registering and then editing template volumes of interest 'as required' would improve inter-examiner reliability compared with manual delineation, without compromising validity. MRI was performed with 30 sub-acute stroke patients with motor deficits (mean NIHSS = 11, range 0-17). Four independent examiners manually delineated VOIs for the posterior limbs of the internal capsules on T1 images, or edited template VOIs that had been registered to the T1 images if they encroached on ventricles or basal ganglia. Fractional anisotropy within each VOI and interhemispheric asymmetry were then calculated. We found that 13/30 registered template VOIs required editing. Edited template VOIs were more spatially similar between examiners than the manually delineated VOIs (p = 0.005). Both methods produced similar asymmetry values that correlated with clinical scores with near perfect levels of agreement between examiners. Contralesional fractional anisotropy correlated with age when edited template VOIs were used but not when VOIs were manually delineated. Editing template VOIs as required is reliable, increases the validity of fractional anisotropy measurements in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, and is less time-consuming compared to manual delineation. This approach could support the use of FA asymmetry measures in routine clinical practice. ? 2013 The Authors.",Diffusion-weighted imaging; Magnetic resonance imaging; Prognosis; Stroke,"adult; aged; article; basal ganglion; brain ventricle; capsula interna; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; clinical practice; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; female; fractional anisotropy; human; image analysis; imaging system; interhemispheric transfer; male; middle aged; motor dysfunction; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prognosis; radiological parameters; reliability; validity; very elderly; volume of interest; white matter; Article; brain asymmetry; diffusion tensor imaging; left hemisphere; neuroimaging; right hemisphere; analysis of variance; anisotropy; capsula interna; cerebrovascular accident; hemispheric dominance; image processing; pathology; pathophysiology; statistical model; white matter; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Anisotropy; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Internal Capsule; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Stroke; White Matter",2-s2.0-84899529439

Colorectal cancer in patients aged 25 years and under is infrequent and may represent a unique subgroup of patients. This study aimed to describe the population of young people in New Zealand diagnosed with colorectal cancer, their tumour characteristics, management and outcomes. Methods: A retrospective clinical study was conducted via review of medical records for all patients 25 years of age and under, diagnosed with colorectal adenocarcinoma in New Zealand between 1 January 1997 and 31 December 2007. Results: Fifty patients with colorectal adenocarcinoma were identified from the New Zealand Cancer Registry. Seven had a positive family history of colorectal cancer, while eight had predisposing factors (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, regional enteritis). The most common presenting symptoms were abdominal pain and weight loss. Twenty-eight cases presented acutely. Eighteen presented with stage IV disease at diagnosis. Eighteen were referred to a genetics service. Five-year overall survival was 49%. Discussion: Those aged 25 years and under that develop colorectal cancer tend to present acutely and move through the secondary care pathway swiftly, being diagnosed at a more advanced stage, and have a poorer prognosis than their adult counterparts. Familial cancers form a more significant component of youth colorectal cancers compared to the older population and input from genetic service should be considered. ? 2013 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.",Adolescent; Colorectal neoplasms; Colorectal surgery; New Zealand; Young adult,adenocarcinoma; age; Colorectal Neoplasms; epidemiology; female; human; male; New Zealand; prognosis; retrospective study; young adult; Adenocarcinoma; Age Factors; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84899488110

It has also been associated with the frequent occurrence of brown haze in the region. This article examines quantitatively the differential effects of the local-, synoptic- and large-scale (El Ni?o-Southern Oscillation-ENSO, Southern Annular Mode-SAM) climate conditions on daily NO2 concentrations in urban Auckland under the framework of generalized linear models. The local meteorology is found to be the most important driver of the daily NO2 concentrations in Auckland, primarily through the coupling of local-scale atmospheric flow and stability conditions with local emissions and chemical processes. Both the synoptic circulation and large-scale climate modes play significant roles in determining the local air pollution. Synoptic circulations, even after controlling for the local meteorological conditions, modulate the daily NO2 at a regional level via two main mechanisms: (1) blocking types facilitate the transport of clean oceanic air over the Auckland landmass, leading to generally low NO2 concentrations; (2) westerly cyclonic types contribute to region-wide increases in NO2 concentrations due to the enhanced mixing-in and/or downward transport of ozone (O3) from the upper troposphere or stratosphere. The large-scale climate modes, ENSO and SAM, modulate the regional air quality through changing the frequency of occurrence and air-mass characteristics of synoptic systems over New Zealand. Overall, this study demonstrates a holistic approach to understand how atmospheric circulations of different scales affect local air quality and thus provides useful information for the formulation of effective public health management and planning strategies in response to future climate variability and change. ? 2013 Royal Meteorological Society.",Air quality; ENSO; Generalized linear model; Local meteorology; Public health management; SAM; Self-organizing map; Synoptic circulation,Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric pressure; Climate change; Conformal mapping; Maximum likelihood; Meteorology; Public health; Self organizing maps; ENSO; Generalized linear model; Health management; SAM; Synoptic circulations; Nitrogen oxides; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; climate modeling; concentration (composition); El Nino-Southern Oscillation; emission inventory; health impact; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; pollutant transport; public health; respiratory disease; stratosphere; synoptic meteorology; troposphere; urban atmosphere; Auckland; New Zealand; North Island,2-s2.0-84899481581

We sought to describe the clinical and microbiology features of children with infective endocarditis (IE) between 1994 and 2012. METHODS:: Retrospective review of patients <16 years identified from hospital records. RESULTS:: In total 85 episodes occurred in 82 children and 68 (80%) were classified as Definite IE and 17 as Possible IE according to modified Duke criteria. From Pacific Island countries, 13 cases were referred. There were 72 children who originated in New Zealand, of whom 52% were either indigenous New Zealand Maori or Pacific migrants. The median age at diagnosis was 7 (0-15) years. Of the 85 cases, 51 (60%) had congenital heart disease 10 children with rheumatic heart disease developed IE. Of the 85 cases, 35 (41%) met our criteria for healthcare-associated IE. 39/85 underwent surgery for IE. As direct result of IE, 4 (4.7%) children died and 9% of survivors had neurologic sequelae. Attributable in-hospital mortality was 4.7%. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common organism, accounting for 26 episodes (30.6%). Other notable pathogens included Corynebacterium diphtheriae (10 cases, 11.8%) and Streptococcus pyogenes (7 cases, 8.2%). In 6 episodes, the microbiologic diagnosis was made by 16S ribosomal RNA testing of excised cardiac tissue. CONCLUSIONS:: Congenital heart disease was the major risk factor for IE; however, rheumatic heart disease is also an important risk factor in New Zealand, with implications for local endocarditis prophylaxis recommendations. In addition to a high burden of healthcare-associated and staphylococcal IE, pathogens such as C. diphtheriae and S. pyogenes occurred. 16S ribosomal RNA testing is a useful tool to determine the etiologic agent in culture-negative IE. ? 2014 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.",congenital heart disease; infective endocarditis; New Zealand; rheumatic heart disease,"RNA 16S; adolescent; bacterial endocarditis; cardiovascular risk; child; clinical feature; comorbidity; congenital heart disease; Corynebacterium diphtheriae; disease predisposition; Fallot tetralogy; female; heart injury; heart surgery; human; incidence; infant; major clinical study; male; mortality; New Zealand; newborn; priority journal; review; rheumatic heart disease; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pyogenes; transthoracic echocardiography; endocarditis; epidemiology; Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections; isolation and purification; microbiology; preschool child; prevalence; risk factor; survival; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Corynebacterium diphtheriae; Endocarditis; Female; Gram-Positive Bacterial Infections; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; New Zealand; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pyogenes; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-84899477238

Avoiding unnecessary hospitalisations has the potential for significant cost savings and is often in line with patient preference. Objective: To determine the extent of potentially avoidable hospital admissions among patients admitted to hospital in the last year of life and to cost these accordingly. Design: An observational retrospective case note review with economic impact assessment. Setting: Two large acute hospitals in the North of England, serving contrasting socio-demographic populations. Patients: A total of 483 patients who died within 1 year of admission to hospital. Measurements: Data were collected across a range of clinical, demographic, economic and service use variables and were collected from hospital case notes and routinely collected sources. Palliative medicine consultants identified admissions that were potentially avoidable. Results: Of 483 admissions, 35 were classified as potentially avoidable. Avoiding these admissions and caring for the patients in alternative locations would save the two hospitals ?5.9 million per year. Reducing length of stay in all 483 patients by 14% has the potential to save the two hospitals ?47.5 million per year; however, this cost would have to be offset against increased community care costs. Limitations: A lack of accurate cost data on alternative care provision in the community limits the accuracy of economic estimates. Conclusions: Reducing length of hospital stay in palliative care patients may offer the potential to achieve higher hospital cost savings than preventing avoidable admissions. Further research is required to determine both the feasibility of reducing length of hospital stay for patients with palliative care needs and the economic impact of doing so. ?

We have shown that both relative maternal under-nutrition (UN) and maternal obesity result in metabolic derangements in offspring, independent of the postnatal dietary environment. Since insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) has been shown to be independently associated with obesity and diabetes risk, we examined the IGF-IGFBP axis in male rat offspring following either maternal UN or maternal obesity to explain possible common pathways in the development of metabolic disorders. Wistar rats were time-mated and fed either a control diet (CONT), 50 % of CONT (UN) or a high-fat (HF) diet throughout pregnancy. Male offspring were weaned onto a standard chow diet and blood and tissues were collected at postnatal day 160. Plasma and hepatic tissue samples were analysed for key players in the IGF-IGFBP system. Both maternal UN and HF resulted in increased fat mass, hyperinsulinemia, hyperleptinemia and altered blood lipid profiles in offspring compared to CONT. Circulating IGF-1 and IGFBP3 levels and hepatic mRNA expression of IGFBP1 and IGFBP2 were significantly decreased in UN and HF offspring compared to CONT. DNA methylation of the IGFBP2 promotor region was similar between maternal dietary groups. Although chaperone gene heat-shock protein 90 and hepatic IGFBP1 were significantly correlated in CONT offspring this effect was absent in both UN and HF offspring. In conclusion, this study is one of the first to directly compare two experimental models of developmental programming representing both ends of the maternal dietary spectrum. Our data suggest that two disparate nutritional models that elicit similar adverse metabolic phenotypes in offspring are characterised by common alterations in the IGF-IGFBP pathway. ?

We are attempting to fast-track a targeted approach to drug design by generating analogues of a validated hit from molecular library screening that shares its chemical scaffold with a current therapeutic, the anti-arthritic drug Lobenzarit (LBZ). Our target, anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (AnPRT), is an enzyme from the tryptophan biosynthetic pathway in Mtb. A bifurcated hydrogen bond was found to be a key feature of the LBZ-like chemical scaffold and critical for enzyme inhibition. We have determined crystal structures of compounds in complex with the enzyme that indicate that the bifurcated hydrogen bond assists in orientating compounds in the correct conformation to interact with key residues in the substrate-binding tunnel of Mtb-AnPRT. Characterising the inhibitory potency of the hit and its analogues in different ways proved useful, due to the multiple substrates and substrate binding sites of this enzyme. Binding in a site other than the catalytic site was found to be associated with partial inhibition. An analogue, 2-(2-5-methylcarboxyphenylamino)-3-methylbenzoic acid, that bound at the catalytic site and caused complete, rather than partial, inhibition of enzyme activity was found. Therefore, we designed and synthesised an extended version of the scaffold on the basis of this observation. The resultant compound, 2,6-bis-(2-carboxyphenylamino)benzoate, is a 40-fold more potent inhibitor of the enzyme than the original hit and provides direction for further structure-based drug design. ? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to improve inhibitory control in healthy and cocaine-dependent subjects. This study aimed to understand the neurophysiological effects before and after acute MPH administration in active MA-dependent and control subjects. Fifteen MA-dependent and 18 control subjects aged 18-46 years were scanned using functional magnetic resonance imaging before and after either a single oral dose of MPH (18 mg) or placebo while performing a color-word Stroop task. Baseline accuracy was lower (p = 0.026) and response time (RT) was longer (p < 0.0001) for the incongruent compared to congruent condition, demonstrating the task probed cognitive control. Increased activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and parietal cortex during the incongruent and Stroop effect conditions, respectively was observed in MA-dependent compared to control subjects (p < 0.05), suggesting the need to recruit neural resources within these regions for conflict resolution. Post- compared to pre-MPH treatment, increased RT and DLPFC activation for the Stroop effect were observed in MA-dependent subjects (p < 0.05). In comparison to MPH-treated controls and placebo-treated MA-dependent subjects, MPH-treated MA-dependent subjects showed decreased activation of parietal and occipital regions during the incongruent and Stroop effect conditions (p < 0.05). These findings suggest that in MA-dependent subjects, MPH facilitated increased recruitment of the DLPFC for Stroop conflict resolution, and a decreased need for recruitment of neural resources in parietal and occipital regions compared to the other groups, while maintaining a comparable level of task performance to that achieved pre-drug administration.

In the study, 90 participants, aged 18-30, completed web-based questionnaires assessing demographics, current health, and past health behaviors before being gender block randomized to conditions in which disgust, embarrassment, or control (no emotion) were induced. Participants completed health decision-making vignettes covering the disgusting and embarrassing aspects of sexual healthcare. Factorial ANOVAs showed that although there were some complexities in the manipulation, disgust and embarrassment predicted greater anticipated delay and avoidance of elicitors, but only among specific groups. Embarrassment predicted anticipated help-seeking delays for embarrassment elicitors (i.e. sexual history assessment and physical examination), while disgust predicted anticipated help-seeking delays involving disgust elicitors (i.e. collecting genital discharge). However, these effects were moderated, with embarrassment only predicting anticipated delays among individuals reporting multiple sexual partners and disgust predicting anticipated delays and avoidance among persons reporting poorer subjective health. In sum, the current report provides among the first empirical demonstrations that emotions such as embarrassment and disgust may be causally implicated in anticipated delays and avoidance in sexual healthcare.

The validity of each attribute was independently assessed by 16 experts in quality of care and emergency medicine. Valid and reliable attributes were included in a critical appraisal tool for healthcare quality indicators, which was piloted by emergency medicine specialists. Twenty-three attributes were identified, and all were rated moderate to extremely important by an expert panel. The reliability was high: alpha = 0.98. Twelve existing tools explicitly stated a median (range) of 14 (8-17) attributes. A critical appraisal tool incorporating all the attributes was developed. This was piloted by four emergency medicine specialists who were asked to appraise and rank a set of six candidate indicators. Although using the tool took more time than implicit gestalt decision making: median (interquartile range) 190 (43-352) min versus 17.5 (3-34) min, their rankings changed after using the tool. To inform the appraisal of quality improvement indicators for emergency medicine, a comprehensive list of indicator attributes was identified, validated, developed into a tool and piloted. Although expert consensus is still required, this tool provides an explicit basis for discussions around indicator selection. ? 2014 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine and Australasian Society for Emergency Medicine.",Evidence-based emergency medicine; Pilot study; Quality indicator; Review; Validation study,"clinical assessment tool; clinical indicator; emergency medicine; good clinical practice; health care quality; health care system; health service; human; priority journal; quality control; quality indicator critical appraisal tool; review; validation study; health care quality; standards; Emergency Medicine; Humans; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Quality of Health Care",2-s2.0-84897938061

Despite its long history, MCF-7 is a surprisingly heterogeneous line. We previously showed that if MCF-7 cells were cultured for a prolonged period either in the absence of estrogen or in the presence of the antiestrogen tamoxifen, sub-lines were selected that differed from the parental line in ploidy, mean cell volume, signaling pathway usage, and drug sensitivity. This suggests a process of selection of preexisting variants rather than of adaptation of the parental line. All the sublines were estrogen receptor (ER) positive, raising the question of whether MCF-7 also contains ER negative variants. Here, we have looked for such variants by culturing for a prolonged period in the presence of fulvestrant, an estrogen antagonist that has no estrogen agonist activity. Three sublines were developed, each of which was ER negative, progesterone receptor (PR) negative and expressed only a low level of HER2. Each of the variants differed from the original MCF-7 line in ploidy, modal cell volume, and signaling pathway usage. Control experiments in which cells were cultured for a prolonged period in the absence of estrogen selected for variants that were ER and PR positive. The properties of the triple-negative MCF-7 were compared with those of an existing triple-negative cell line, MDA-MB-231, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)+ SKBr3, as well as from those of the ""immortalized"" breast epithelial line MCF10A. The results suggest that new variants or phenotypes of MCF-7 might be generated continuously in culture, and by implication this might apply to breast cancer development and even normal breast epithelial development in vivo. ? 2014 Euphemia Leung et al.",,"epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; fulvestrant; progesterone receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; article; cancer cell; cell population; cell proliferation assay; cell strain MCF 7; cell volume; human; human cell; human cell culture; phenotype; triple negative breast cancer; Western blotting; breast tumor; female; metabolism; pathology; tumor cell line; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Humans; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen; Receptors, Progesterone",2-s2.0-84897848762

However, there is a lack of evidence that EWS surveillance systems lead to a reduction in severe morbidity. Aims To determine whether as EWS may have improved the detection of severe maternal morbidity or lessened the severity of illness among women with severe morbidity at a large tertiary maternity unit at Auckland City Hospital (ACH), New Zealand. Methods Admissions to intensive care, cardiothoracic and vascular intensive care, or an obstetric high-dependency unit (HDU) were identified from clinical and hospital administrative databases. Case reviews and transcribed observation charts were presented to a multidisciplinary review group who, through group consensus, determined whether an EWS might have hastened recognition and/or escalation and effective treatment. Results The multidisciplinary review team determined that an EWS might have reduced the seriousness of maternal morbidity in five cases (7.6%), including three admissions for obstetric sepsis to intensive care unit and two to obstetric HDU for post-partum haemorrhage. No patient had a complete set of respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure and temperature recordings at every time period.

Design: Cross-sectional study of screened patients. Setting: 10 community pharmacies across Alberta and British Columbia, Canada from 14 January to 30 July 2011. Participants: The participating pharmacy staff screened consecutive patients, or agents of patients, who were dropping or picking up prescription medications. Primary outcome measures: Patients were screened to determine the proportions of them using prescription drugs and/or NHPs, as well as their respective AE rates. All AEs reported by the screened patients who took a NHP, consented to, and were available for, a detailed telephone interview (14%) were adjudicated fully to assess for causality. Results: Over a total of 105 pharmacy weeks and 1118 patients screened, 410 patients reported taking prescription drugs only (36.7%; 95% CI 33.9% to 39.5%), 37 reported taking NHPs only (3.3%; 95% CI 2.4% to 4.5%) and 657 reported taking prescription drugs and NHPs concurrently (58.8%; 95% CI 55.9% to 61.6%). In total, 54 patients reported an AE, representing 1.2% (95% CI 0.51% to 2.9%), 2.7% (95% CI 0.4% to 16.9%) and 7.3% (95% CI 5.6% to 9.6%) of each population, respectively. Compared with patients who reported using prescription drugs, the patients who reported using prescription drugs and NHPs concurrently were 6.4 times more likely to experience an AE (OR; 95% CI 2.52 to 16.17; p<0.001). Combined with data from Ontario, Canada, a national proportion was calculated, which found that 45.4% (95% CI 43.8% to 47.0%) of Canadians who visit community pharmacies take NHPs and prescription drugs concurrently, and of those, 7.4% (95% CI 6.3% to 8.8%) report an AE. Conclusions: A substantial proportion of community pharmacy patients use prescription drugs and NHPs concurrently; these patients are at a greater risk of experiencing an AE.

Although maternal pre-pregnancy BMI (mppBMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) may be associated with adult offspring adiposity, no study has examined associations with obesity changes. Associations of mppBMI and GWG with longitudinal change in offspring's BMI (ΔBMI) were examined, and whether associations are explained by offspring genetics was assessed. Methods A birth cohort of 1400 adults, with data at birth, age 17 and 32 years was used. After genotyping offspring, genetic scores, predictive of exposures and outcome were created, and linear regression models with and without scores were fit to examine the associations of mppBMI and GWG with ΔBMI. Results A one SD change in mppBMI and GWG was associated with a 0.83 and a 0.75 kg/m increase in ΔBMI, respectively. The association between mppBMI and offspring ΔBMI was slightly attenuated (12%) with the addition of genetic scores. In the GWG model, a significant substantial 28.2% decrease in the coefficient was observed. Conclusions This study points to an association between maternal excess weight in pregnancy and offspring BMI change from adolescence to adulthood. Genetic factors may account, in part, for GWG/ΔBMI association. These findings broaden observations that maternal obesity-related phenotypes have long-term consequences for offspring health.

Treatment options include anti-thyroid medications or definitive therapy: thyroidectomy or radioactive iodine (I131). Traditionally, I131 has been the preferred definitive treatment for Graves' disease in New Zealand. Reports of concomitant thyroid cancer occurring in up to 17% of Graves' patients suggest surgery, if performed with low morbidity, may be the preferred option. The aim of this study was to determine the rate of thyroid cancer and surgical outcomes in a New Zealand cohort of patients undergoing thyroidectomy for Graves' disease. Method: This study is a retrospective review of Waikato region patients undergoing thyroid surgery for Graves' disease during the 10-year period prior to 1 December 2011. Results: A total of 833 patients underwent thyroid surgery. Of these, 117 were for Graves' disease. Total thyroidectomy was performed in 82, near-total in 33 and subtotal in 2 patients. Recurrent thyrotoxicosis developed in one subtotal patient requiring I131 therapy. There were two cases of permanent hypoparathyroidism and one of permanent recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Eight patients (6.8%) had thyroid cancer detected, none of whom had overt nodal disease. Five were papillary microcarcinomas (one of which was multifocal), two were papillary carcinomas (11mm and 15mm) and one was a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma. Conclusion: Thyroid cancer was identified in approximately 7% of patients undergoing surgery for Graves' disease. A low complication rate (&lt;2%) of permanent hypoparathyroidism and nerve injury (&lt;1%) supports surgery being a safe alternative to I131 especially for patients with young children, ophthalmopathy or compressive symptoms. ? 2012 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.",Graves' disease; Hypoparathyroidism; Thyroid cancer; Thyroidectomy; Thyrotoxicosis,"Adenocarcinoma, Follicular; adolescent; adult; aged; carcinoma; Carcinoma, Papillary; complication; evaluation study; female; Graves disease; human; male; middle aged; New Zealand; postoperative complication; retrospective study; Thyroid Neoplasms; thyroidectomy; young adult; Adenocarcinoma, Follicular; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma; Carcinoma, Papillary; Female; Graves Disease; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Thyroid Neoplasms; Thyroidectomy; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84897077783

However more understanding is required of how to make robots acceptable to older people. This study aimed to assess how older peoples' robot attitudes and drawings were related to their reactions to a conversational robot. We also assessed whether altering the robot's virtual face affected peoples' responses. Twenty participants aged over 55 conversed with a Peoplebot robot for 30 min. During the interaction the robot displayed six different face conditions on its monitor in a randomized order. The six robot conditions varied on two dimensions; (i) facial appearance (humanlike, machinelike, or no face), and (ii) robot gender. Measures included the robot attitudes scale, drawings of a robot's face prior to the interaction, blood pressure (BP), heart rate, and evaluations of the robot. Results suggest participants did not evaluate the robot's six face displays conditions differently. However, there was a trend for men to evaluate the robot more highly than women did. Participants' positive attitudes towards robots before the robot interactions were associated with positive robot evaluations after the interactions. Larger drawings were associated with higher systolic BP after interacting with the robot. These findings suggest that, at least in the short-term, people's pre-existing mental models of robots may be more important for acceptance than the human or machinelikeness, or even the presence of a robot's virtual face. More research is needed on gender differences in reactions to eldercare robots. Compared with creating different robot faces to meet individual preferences, promoting positive attitudes towards robots may be a cost-effective method of promoting robot acceptance. Drawings of robots may be a useful, more implicit way of assessing anxiety towards robots in potential users. ? 2014 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Attitudes; Drawings; HRI; Older people; Robot; Technology acceptance models,Behavioral research; Blood pressure; Drawing (graphics); Virtual reality; Attitudes; Cost-effective methods; HRI; Individual preference; Influence evaluation; Older People; Robot interactions; Technology acceptance model; Robots,2-s2.0-84897065400

To date, surgeon-based outcomes have been reported, but only one report of patient-oriented outcomes has appeared in the literature. The objective of this study was to review our experience after introducing sialendoscopy to New Zealand and report the patient-perceived benefit. Study Design A prospective observational study of all sialendoscopic procedures performed in the only sialendoscopy-practicing center in New Zealand between June 2010 and June 2012. Methods Clinical and epidemiological data of all patients were recorded. Sialendoscopic findings, complications, and outcomes were noted. The Glasgow Benefit Inventory questionnaire was administered to the patients at their follow-up. Results Fifty-four patients underwent a total of 66 sialendoscopic procedures, involving 44 parotid and 22 submandibular glands. There was a complete symptom resolution in 54 procedures (82%). Sialolith removal was successful in 67% of cases, with postsialendoscopy symptom resolution in 86% of sialolithiasis cases. Symptoms resolved in 81% of cases with ductal stenosis. The overall mean Glasgow Benefit Inventory score was +31, which compares very favorably with other otolaryngology procedures. Conclusions This study shows a substantial positive patient-perceived benefit of sialendoscopy for both sialolith- and stenosis-based pathology.

While legally available in a number of countries and jurisdictions, it remains controversial and illegal in New Zealand. Aim: The study aimed to explore the reasons some healthy older New Zealanders oppose physician-assisted dying in order to inform current debate. Design: Recorded interviews were transcribed and analysed by the authors after some edits had been made by respondents. Setting/participants: In all, 11 older participants (over 65 years) who responded to advertisements placed in Grey Power magazines and a University of Auckland email list were interviewed for around 1 h and asked a number of open-ended questions. Results: Four central themes opposing physician-assisted dying were identified from the interviews: one's personal experience with health care and dying and death, religious reasoning and beliefs, slippery slope worries and concern about potential abuses if physicianassisted dying were legalised. Conclusions: An important finding of the study suggests that how some older individuals think about physician-assisted dying is strongly influenced by their past experiences of dying and death. While some participants had witnessed good, well-managed dying and death experiences which confirmed for them the view that physician-assisted dying was unnecessary, those who had witnessed poor dying and death experiences opposed physician-assisted dying on the grounds that such practices could come to be abused by others. ?

As rheumatoid arthritis progresses, localised forefoot deformities such as hallux valgus and clawing of the lesser toes occur, leading to a high proportion of people with rheumatoid arthritis wearing sandals. Sandals may affect postural stability due to poor motion control. The aim was to assess two different open-toe sandals on postural stability in people with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods Twenty women with rheumatoid arthritis were assessed in quiet standing under four conditions: (1) open-back sandal; (2) closed-back sandal; (3) own footwear and (4) bare feet. Postural stability was assessed as postural sway in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions, with eyes open and eyes closed, using a pressure mat. Repeated measures analysis of variance tested the interaction effect of the footwear and eye conditions on anterior-posterior and medial-lateral sway. Findings In eyes-open, there was no significant difference in anterior-posterior sway (P =.169) and medial-lateral sway (P =.325) for footwear conditions. In eyes-closed testing, compared with barefoot conditions, increased anterior-posterior sway was observed with participants' footwear (P <.0001), the open-back sandal (P =.005), and the closed-back sandal (P =.017). With eyes closed, increased anterior-posterior sway was also observed with the participants' footwear compared with the closed-back sandal (P =.041). Increased medial-lateral sway was observed with the closed-back sandal compared with bare feet (P =.014). Interpretation Sandals may be detrimental to older women with well-established rheumatoid arthritis when eyes are closed. Further investigation is needed to evaluate the effect of sandals on dynamic tasks. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Balance; Foot deformity; Footwear; Postural stability; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sandals,"Balancing; Biophysics; Foot deformity; Footwear; Postural stability; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sandals; Diseases; adult; aged; article; body posture; clinical article; closed back sandal; controlled study; female; human; middle aged; open back sandal; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis; shoe; standing; very elderly; visual system function; Balance; Foot deformity; Footwear; Postural stability; Rheumatoid arthritis; Sandals; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Postural Balance; Posture; Shoes",2-s2.0-84896402850

All three participants were non-verbal with no current functional system of communication; the two children had long histories of PECS failure. A series of replications, with different length baselines, was used to examine whether video self modeling could replace the PECS method of teaching to achieve the same goals. All three participants showed rapid learning of their target behavior when introduced to their self modeling videos, and effects generalized without the need for further intervention. We conclude that VSM, using feedforward, can provide a fast, simple way of teaching the use of a picture-based communication system without the need for prompts or intensive operant conditioning.

Beyond this, the risks and benefits of thrombolysis are uncertain. Aims: To determine whether thrombolysis and reperfusion were beneficial after 4·5h, we examined clinical and radiological outcomes in patients treated with tissue plasminogen activator or placebo within 4·5-6h, using data from the Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation Trial. Methods: In the Echoplanar Imaging Thrombolytic Evaluation Trial, ischemic stroke patients presenting three to six-hours after stroke onset were randomized to tissue plasminogen activator or placebo, without knowledge of magnetic resonance imaging results. This analysis was restricted to patients treated between 4·5 and 6h. The effect of tissue plasminogen activator and reperfusion on infarct growth between baseline diffusion-weighted imaging and day 90 T2 imaging was assessed, along with good neurological outcome (?8 point reduction or reaching 0-1 at 90 days on National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale) and functional outcome (modified Rankin scale). The effect of tissue plasminogen activator on reperfusion was also analyzed. Results: Sixty-nine patients were treated 4·5-6h after onset, and infarct growth was assessed in 63. Tissue plasminogen activator was associated with lower relative growth (94% vs. 168%, P=0·03) and a trend to lower absolute growth (-0·17ml versus 9·6ml, P=0·07). Reperfusion was increased in the tissue plasminogen activator group (58% versus 25%, P=0·03) and was associated with increased rates of good neurological (86% versus 28% P<0·001) and functional (modified Rankin scale 0-2 73% versus 34%, P=0·01) outcomes. Reperfusion was strongly associated with lower relative (80% versus 189%, P<0·001) and absolute (-2·5ml versus 40ml, P<0·001) infarct growth. Conclusions: Thrombolysis 4·5-6h after stroke onset reduced infarct growth and increased the rate of reperfusion, which was associated with good neurological and functional outcome. ? 2013 World Stroke Organization.",MRI; Stroke; Thrombolysis; tPA,"placebo; tissue plasminogen activator; fibrinolytic agent; tissue plasminogen activator; adult; aged; article; blood clot lysis; brain infarction size; brain ischemia; controlled study; diffusion weighted imaging; double blind procedure; echo planar imaging; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; Rankin scale; reperfusion; treatment indication; very elderly; blood clot lysis; brain infarction; cerebrovascular accident; controlled clinical trial; methodology; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phase 2 clinical trial; severity of illness index; TPA; treatment outcome; MRI; stroke; thrombolysis; tPA; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Infarction; Double-Blind Method; Female; Fibrinolytic Agents; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Reperfusion; Severity of Illness Index; Stroke; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84896313781

To determine the extent to which participants at the Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) 11 meeting agree that instruments used in clinical trials to measure OMERACT core outcome domains in acute gout fulfill OMERACT filter requirements of truth, discrimination, and feasibility; and where future research efforts need to be directed. Methods. Results of a systematic literature review and analysis of individual-level data from recent clinical studies of acute gout were presented to OMERACT participants. The information was discussed in breakout groups, and opinion was defined by subsequent voting in a plenary session. Endorsement was defined as at least 70% of participants voting in agreement with the proposition (where the denominator excluded those participants who did not vote or who voted ""don't know""). Results. The following measures were endorsed for use in clinical trials of acute gout: (1) 5-point Likert scale and/or visual analog scale (0 to 100 mm) to measure pain; (2) 4-point Likert scale for joint swelling; (3) 4-point Likert scale for joint tenderness; and (4) 5-point Likert scale for patient global assessment of response to treatment. Measures for the activity limitations domain were not endorsed. Conclusion. Measures of pain, joint swelling, joint tenderness, and patient global assessment in acute gout were endorsed at OMERACT 11. These measures should now be used in clinical trials of acute gout.

Five core domains have been endorsed by Outcome Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) for acute gout: pain, joint swelling, joint tenderness, patient global assessment, and activity limitation. We evaluated instruments for these domains according to the OMERACT filter: truth, feasibility, and discrimination. Methods. A systematic search strategy for instruments used to measure the acute gout core domains was formulated. For each method, articles were assessed by 2 reviewers to summarize information according to the specific components of the OMERACT filter. Results. Seventy-seven articles and abstracts met the inclusion criteria. Pain was most frequently reported (76 studies, 20 instruments). The pain instruments used most often were 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) and 5-point Likert scale. Both methods have high feasibility, face and content validity, and within- and between-group discrimination. Four-point Likert scales assessing index joint swelling and tenderness have been used in numerous acute gout studies; these instruments are feasible, with high face and content validity, and show within- and between-group discrimination. Five-point Patient Global Assessment of Response to Treatment (PGART) scales are feasible and valid, and show within- and between-group discrimination. Measures of activity limitations were infrequently reported, and insufficient data were available to make definite assessments of the instruments for this domain. Conclusion. Many different instruments have been used to assess the acute gout core domains. Pain VAS and 5-point Likert scales, 4-point Likert scales of index joint swelling and tenderness and 5-point PGART instruments meet the criteria for the OMERACT filter.

As the wave signatures of our targets are typically low in amplitude, we exploit multi-channel acquisition and processing techniques. These are commonly used in seismology to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of data. We identify vessel proxies with a diameter on the order of 1mm, at a depth of 18mm.

Design: Cross-sectional validation study. Setting: Bay of Plenty, New Zealand. Participants: Forty-five community-living residents aged 85-86 years. Equal proportions of participants were recruited at low, medium and high nutrition risk based on their SCREEN II score 12 months prior. Measurements: Nutrition risk was assessed using SCREEN II. Demographic and health data were established. Using established criterion a dietitian's nutrition risk rating assessment ranked participants from low risk (score of 1) to high risk (score of 10). The assessment included a medical history, anthropometric measures and dietary intake. Dietary intake was established from three 24 hour multiple pass recalls (MPR). A Spearman's correlation determined the association between the SCREEN II score and the dietitian's risk score. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were completed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the cut-off point for high nutrition risk. Results: The SCREEN II score was significantly correlated with the dietitian's risk rating (rs = -0.76 (p<0.01). A newly defined cut-off point <49 was established for high nutrition risk derived from ROC curves and AUC (0.87, p < 0.01); sensitivity 90% and specificity 86%.

GLP-1, insulin and glucose were measured during 75 g oral glucose tolerance testing at the start and end of each CGM. Results: Post-operative hyperglycaemia occurred after both surgeries in the first 6 h, with a more rapid decline in glycaemia after GBP (p < 0.001). Beyond 24 h post-operatively, continuous overlapping of net glycaemia action reduced from baseline after GBP (median [interquartile range]) 1.6 [1.2-2.4] to 1.0 [0.7-1.3] and after SG 1.4 [0.9-1.8] to 0.7 [0.7-1.0]; p < 0.05), similar to controls (2.2 [1.7-2.5] to 1.3 [0.8-2.8] p < 0.05).

GRIN2A encodes the regulatory GluN2A subunit of the glutamate-gated N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), involvement of which in melanoma remains undefined. Here, we sequenced coding exons of GRIN2A in 19 low-passage melanoma cell lines derived from patients with metastatic melanoma. Potential mutation impact was evaluated in silico, including within the GluN2A crystal structure, and clinical correlations were sought. We found that of 19 metastatic melanoma tumors, four (21%) carried five missense mutations in the evolutionarily conserved domains of GRIN2A; two were previously reported. Melanoma cells that carried these mutations were treatment-na?ve. Sorting intolerant from tolerant analysis predicted that S349F, G762E, and P1132L would disrupt protein function. When modeled into the crystal structure of GluN2A, G762E was seen to potentially alter GluN1-GluN2A interactions and ligand binding, implying disruption to NMDAR functionality. Patients whose tumors carried non-synonymous GRIN2A mutations had faster disease progression and shorter overall survival (P < 0.05). This was in contrast to the BRAF V600E mutation, found in 58% of tumors but showing no correlation with clinical outcome (P = 0.963). Although numbers of patients in this study are small, and firm conclusions about the association between GRIN2A mutations and poor clinical outcome cannot be drawn, our results highlight the high prevalence of GRIN2A mutations in metastatic melanoma and suggest for the first time that mutated NMDARs impact melanoma progression. ? 2014 D'mello, Flanagan, Green, Leung, Askarian-Amiri, Joseph, McCrystal, Isaacs, Shaw, Furneaux, During, Finlay, Baguley and Kalev-Zylinska.",GluN2A; Glutamate; GRIN2A; Melanoma; Mutation; NMDA receptor; NMDAR; Prognosis,alpha interferon; B Raf kinase; dacarbazine; lomustine; procarbazine; temozolomide; tumor vaccine; vascular targeting agent; vincristine; adult; aged; article; clinical article; computer model; controlled study; disease association; female; gene; gene mutation; gene sequence; gene structure; GRIN2A gene; human; human cell; human tissue; male; melanoma; metastatic melanoma; missense mutation; nucleotide sequence; overall survival; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); polymerase chain reaction; protein function; protein structure; sequence analysis; very elderly,2-s2.0-84893649181

Within neurons, SAP97 is localised throughout the secretory trafficking pathway and at the postsynaptic density (PSD). SAP97 differs from other MAGUK family members largely in its long N-terminus and in the sequences between the SH3 and GUK domains, where SAP97 undergoes significant alternative splicing to produce multiple SAP97 isoforms. These splice insertions endow SAP97 with differential cellular localisation patterns and functional roles within neurons. With regard to membrane ion channels, SAP97 forms multi-protein complexes with AMPA and NMDA-type glutamate receptors, and Kv1.4, Kv4.2, and Kir2.2 potassium channels, playing a major role in trafficking and anchoring ion channel surface expression.

There was no increased risk of cardiovascular events after discontinuation of calcium. Introduction: The Auckland calcium study was a 5-year randomised controlled trial of 1 g/day calcium citrate in 1,471 postmenopausal women. Calcium did not reduce total, vertebral or forearm fracture incidence, increased hip fracture incidence and had beneficial effects on bone mineral density (BMD). A secondary analysis raised concerns about the cardiovascular safety of calcium. The purpose of this study was to determine whether the effects of calcium on fracture incidence, BMD and cardiovascular endpoints persisted after supplement discontinuation. Methods: Approximately 5-years post-trial, we collected information on the 1,408 participants alive at trial completion from the national databases of hospital admissions and deaths. We contacted 1,174 women by phone, and from these we obtained information on medical events and post-trial calcium use. We undertook BMD measurements at 10 years in a selected subset of 194 women who took study medication for 5 years in the original trial, and did not take bone-active medications post-trial. Results: Over the 10-year period, there was no effect on total fracture (HR 0.90, 95 % CI 0.75-1.07) or hip fracture incidence (1.40, 0.89-2.21), but significant reductions in forearm (0.62, 0.43-0.89) and vertebral fractures (0.52, 0.32-0.85) in those assigned to calcium. There were no between-group differences in BMD at 10 years at any site. The adverse cardiovascular outcomes observed in the 5-year trial did not persist post-trial. Conclusion: Calcium supplementation for 5 years had no effect on total fracture incidence at 10 years. The positive benefits on BMD and the adverse cardiovascular effects did not persist once supplements were stopped. ? 2013 International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Bone densitometry; Calcium supplements; Fracture; Myocardial infarction; Stroke,"25 hydroxyvitamin D; bisphosphonic acid derivative; citrate calcium; placebo; vitamin D; adult; aged; article; body mass; bone densitometry; bone density; calcium intake; cardiovascular effect; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; data base; drug safety; female; follow up; forearm fracture; fragility fracture; hip fracture; hospital admission; human; incidence; major clinical study; middle aged; mortality; postmenopause; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); secondary analysis; spine fracture; Aged; Bone Density; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Calcium; Cardiovascular Diseases; Dietary Supplements; Double-Blind Method; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hip Fractures; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Osteoporotic Fractures; Spinal Fractures; Withholding Treatment",2-s2.0-84891886104

We set out to evaluate the antiresorptive effects of a single administration of lower doses of zoledronate. A total of 180 postmenopausal women with osteopenia enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial over 2 years at an academic research center. Participants were randomized to a single baseline administration of intravenous zoledronate in doses of 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg, or placebo. The primary endpoint was change in bone mineral density(BMD) at the lumbar spine. Secondary endpoints were change in BMD at the proximal femur and total body, and changes in biochemical markers of bone turnover. After 2 years, the change in spine BMD was greater in each of the zoledronate groups than in the placebo group; values are mean (95% confidence interval [CI]) difference versus placebo: zoledronate 1 mg 4.4% [2.7% to 6.1%]; 2.5 mg 5.5% [3.9% to 7.2%]; 5 mg 5.3% [3.8% to 6.7%], p < 0.001 for each dose). Change in BMD at the total hip was greater in each of the zoledronate groups than the placebo group (mean [95% CI] difference versus placebo: zoledronate 1 mg 2.6% [1.5% to 3.7%]; 2.5 mg 4.4% [3.5% to 5.3%]; 5 mg 4.7% [3.7% to 5.7%], p < 0.001 for each dose). Each of the bone turnover markers, β-C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (β-CTX) and procollagen type-I N-terminal propeptide (P1NP), was lower in each of the 2.5-mg and 5-mg zoledronate groups than the placebo group throughout the trial (p < 0.001 versus placebo for each marker for each dose at each time point). For each endpoint, changes were similar in the 2.5-mg and 5-mg zoledronate groups, whereas those in the 1-mg group were smaller than those in the other zoledronate groups. These data demonstrate that single administrations of zoledronate 1 mg or 2.5 mg produce antiresorptive effects that persist for at least 2 years. Trials assessing the antifracture efficacy of intermittent low doses of zoledronate, in particular the 2.5-mg dose, are justified. ? 2014 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",antiresorptive; bone density; bone turnover; low dose; Zoledronate,"25 hydroxyvitamin D; carboxy terminal telopeptide; placebo; procollagen; procollagen type 1 aminopropeptide; unclassified drug; zoledronic acid; adult; aged; article; body mass; bone density; bone turnover; controlled study; dose response; double blind procedure; drug dose comparison; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; femur; femur fracture; finger fracture; follow up; foot fracture; forearm fracture; hand fracture; hip; human; iritis; jaw osteonecrosis; low drug dose; lumbar spine; major clinical study; metacarpal bone; metatarsal bone; middle aged; osteopenia; outcome assessment; postmenopause; randomized controlled trial; single drug dose; tibia fracture; treatment duration; vitamin blood level; ANTIRESORPTIVE; BONE DENSITY; BONE TURNOVER; LOW DOSE; ZOLEDRONATE; Aged; Bone Density; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; Bone Resorption; Collagen Type I; Diphosphonates; Double-Blind Method; Female; Hip; Humans; Imidazoles; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Peptide Fragments; Peptides; Procollagen; Spine",2-s2.0-84890954555

Telephone interviews were conducted with 28 bereaved older adults recruited from the Brief Risk Identification Geriatric Health Tool trial participants in three geographically diverse District Health Boards in New Zealand. Analysis adhered to the principles of grounded theory and followed the National Centre for Social Research 'Framework' approach. Findings indicate that family and friends play a fundamental role supporting older bereaved adults, both emotionally and practically. Existing community-based organisations were identified as an important source of support following bereavement. Despite the emotional, financial and practical challenges associated with bereavement, the majority of participants questioned the role of, need for and value of formal bereavement support services. Instead, study participants cited a combination of being older and previous life experiences as factors that had enabled them to cope with these largely 'expected' events. Moreover, they demonstrated considerable resilience in managing the emotional and practical changes associated with loss and bereavement. This study poses a challenge to the argument that the growing secularisation of society has led to an increase in the use of professional bereavement services over more 'traditional' forms of support, such as family, friends and community and religious organisations. The paper highlights the value of adopting a public health-based approach as a way of optimising bereavement support via the use of existing community organisations previously known to older people. This is particularly important in those countries where the provision of bereavement support is limited due to resource constraints. ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Bereavement support; End-of-life care; Health-promoting palliative care; Older people; Resilience,"aged; bereavement; coping behavior; female; human; male; New Zealand; palliative therapy; psychology; social support; terminal care; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bereavement; Female; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Palliative Care; Resilience, Psychological; Social Support; Terminal Care",2-s2.0-84889657272

It produces anatomically detailed images of bone, cartilage, tendons and synovial membrane. It can reveal structural damage, in the form of bone erosion, cartilage thinning and/or tendon rupture, and regions of inflammation, using sequences that reveal water content and vascularity. MRI synovitis, tenosynovitis and bone oedema/osteitis all have prognostic significance, and MRI studies of RA have helped elucidate the mechanisms whereby bone and synovial inflammation lead to joint damage. Bone oedema/osteitis has become an important imaging biomarker, and can be used to help predict progression from undifferentiated arthritis to definite RA. Recent MRI studies have confirmed that subclinical inflammation is often present in patients in clinical remission, and these data may affect disease management. Finally, recent clinical trials are reviewed, in which MRI outcome measures are being established as sensitive response markers. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Bone oedema; Cartilage; Clinical trials; Erosions; Imaging; MRI; Osteitis; Rheumatoid arthritis; Synovitis; Tenosynovitis,"abatacept; adalimumab; baricitinib; etanercept; gadolinium; golimumab; infliximab; methotrexate; placebo; rituximab; article; bone erosion; cartilage injury; clinical trial (topic); contrast enhancement; disease activity; drug efficacy; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteitis; outcome assessment; pathogenesis; positron emission tomography; quantitative analysis; remission; rheumatoid arthritis; scoring system; sensitivity analysis; single photon emission computer tomography; synovitis; tenosynovitis; treatment response; articular cartilage; disease course; joint; methodology; pathology; review; rheumatoid arthritis; severity of illness index; synovium; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cartilage, Articular; Disease Progression; Humans; Joints; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Osteitis; Severity of Illness Index; Synovial Membrane; Synovitis; Tenosynovitis",2-s2.0-84887731808

These scores provide a simple estimate of pulmonary vascular bed obstruction, however they have not been adopted clinically as they have poor correlation with mortality and right ventricular (RV) dysfunction. This study performed a quantitative analysis of blood flow and gas exchange in 12 patient-specific models of PE, to understand the limitations of current clot load scores and how their prognostic value could be improved. Prediction of hypoxemia in the models when using estimated baseline (non-occluded) minute ventilation and cardiac output correlated closely with clinical metrics for RV dysfunction, whereas the clot load score had only a weak correlation. The model predicts that large central clots have a greater impact on function than smaller distributed clots with the same total clot load, and that the partial occlusion of a vessel only has a significant impact on pulmonary function when the vessel is close to completely occluded. The effect of clot distribution on the redistribution of blood from its normal pattern - and hence the magnitude of the potential effect on gas exchange - is represented in the model but is not included in current clot load scores. Improved scoring systems need to account for the expected normal distribution of blood in the lung, and the impact of clot on redistributing the blood flow. ? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Computational model; Gas exchange; Perfusion; Pulmonary embolism; Pulmonary pathology,"adult; aged; article; blood flow; clinical article; clot load score; female; gas exchange; heart output; human; hypoxemia; lung embolism; lung minute volume; male; performance; priority journal; quantitative analysis; scoring system; Computational model; Gas exchange; Perfusion; Pulmonary embolism; Pulmonary pathology; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Blood Coagulation; Computer Simulation; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Cardiovascular; Pulmonary Embolism; Severity of Illness Index; Tomography Scanners, X-Ray Computed; Ventricular Dysfunction, Right",2-s2.0-84887006018

Method Study participants were 15-24 year old members of the New Zealand Drivers Study (NZDS) - a prospective cohort study of newly licensed car drivers. The interview stages of the NZDS are linked to, the three licensing stages of the GDLS: learner, restricted and full. Baseline demographic (age, ethnicity, residential location, deprivation), personality (impulsivity, sensation seeking, aggression) and, behavioural data, (including pre-licensed driving behaviour), were obtained at the learner licence interview. Data on distance driven and crashes that occurred at the learner licence and restricted licence stages, were reported at the restricted and full licence interviews, respectively. Crash data were also obtained from police traffic crash report files and this was combined with the self-reported crash data. The analysis of the learner licence stage crashes, when only supervised driving is allowed, was based on the participants who had passed the restricted licence test and undertaken the NZDS, restricted licence interview (n = 2358). The analysis of the restricted licence stage crashes, when unsupervised driving is first allowed, was based on those who had passed the full licence test and completed the full licence interview (n = 1428). Results After controlling for a range of demographic, personality, behavioural variables and distance driven, Poisson regression showed that the only pre-licence driving behaviour that showed a consistent relationship with subsequent crashes was on-road car driving which was associated with an increased risk of being the driver in a car crash during the learner licence period. Conclusion This research showed that pre-licensed driving did not reduce crash risk among learner or restricted licensed drivers, and in some cases (such as on-road car driving) may have increased risk. Young people should be discouraged from the illegal behaviour of driving a car on-road before licensing. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.
