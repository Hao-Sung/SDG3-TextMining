"Cost-Effectiveness of Reclassifying Triptans in Australia: Application of an Economic Evaluation Approach to Regulatory Decisions",2019,"Background: Migraine is a common, chronic, disabling headache disorder. Triptans, used as an acute treatment for migraine, are available via prescription in Australia. An Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) committee rejected reclassifying sumatriptan and zolmitriptan from prescription medicine to pharmacist-only between 2005 and 2009, largely on the basis of concerns about patient risk. Nevertheless, pharmacist-only triptans may reduce migraine duration and free up healthcare resources. Objectives: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of reclassifying triptans from prescription-only to pharmacist-only in Australia. Methods: The study design included decision-analytic modeling combining data from various sources. Behavior before and after reclassification was estimated using medical practitioner and patient surveys and also administrative data. Health outcomes included migraine frequency and duration as well as adverse events (AEs) discussed by the TGA committee. Efficacy and AEs were estimated using randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Results: Reclassifying triptans will reduce migraine duration but increase AEs. This will result in 337 quality-adjusted life-years gained at an increased cost of A$5.9 million over 10 years for all Australian adults older than 15 years (19.6 million). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was estimated to be A$17 412/quality-adjusted life-year gained. Conclusions: The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio is likely to be considered cost-effective by Australian decision makers. Serotonin syndrome, a key concern of the TGA committee, had little impact on the results. Further research is needed regarding pharmacist-only triptan use by migraineurs currently using over-the-counter medicines and by nonmigraineurs, the efficacy of triptans, and the risk of cardiovascular and cerebrovascular AEs and chronic headaches with triptans. ? 2019 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research","non prescription drug; prescription drug; triptan derivative; non prescription drug; oxazolidinone derivative; prescription drug; serotonin 1 agonist; sumatriptan; tryptamine derivative; zolmitriptan; adolescent; adult; age; angina pectoris; Article; Australia; cost effectiveness analysis; death; disease duration; dizziness; drug classification; drug cost; drug induced headache; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; fatigue; gastrointestinal toxicity; heart arrhythmia; human; major clinical study; migraine; patient risk; pharmacist; prescription; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; randomized controlled trial (topic); side effect; thorax pain; transient ischemic attack; classification; cost benefit analysis; drug control; economics; general practitioner; migraine; procedures; trends; Australia; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Drug and Narcotic Control; General Practitioners; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Nonprescription Drugs; Oxazolidinones; Pharmacists; Prescription Drugs; Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists; Sumatriptan; Tryptamines"
"A School-Based Comprehensive Intervention for Childhood Obesity in China: A Cluster Randomized Controlled Trial",2019,"Background: A comprehensive approach involving both environmental and individual strategies offers opportunities to strengthen school-based interventions for childhood obesity. Objectives: To evaluate a theory-based comprehensive intervention implemented within primary schools for childhood obesity in China. Methods: A 1-year, cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted in twelve primary schools (7-11 years old) in Beijing, China. Environmental and individual factors were improved in the intervention group (6 schools, 930 children) to promote knowledge and behaviors related to energy balance. The control group (6 schools, 959 children) did not receive any intervention. The primary outcome was body mass index (BMI) and its Z-score at 12 months. Generalized linear mixed models were used controlling for the cluster effect of school. Results: No significant differences were found between groups on BMI (0.07 kg/m 2 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.16 to 0.31, p = 0.54]) and its Z-score (0.02 [95% CI: -0.08 to 0.11, p = 0.73]) at 12 months. Self-reported knowledge, daily consumption of sugar-sweetened beverage, and frequency of moderate to vigorous physical activity improved at 12 months. Conclusions: The intervention did not mitigate excess weight gain, but did improve children's knowledge and several behaviors related to energy balance. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",""
"Maternal smoking early in pregnancy is associated with increased risk of short stature and obesity in adult daughters",2019,"We assessed anthropometry in 22,421 adult daughters in association with their mothers’ tobacco smoking early in pregnancy (at their first antenatal visit) in Sweden, particularly their risk of short stature and obesity. Adult daughters were grouped by maternal smoking levels during pregnancy: Non-smokers (58.5%), Light smokers (24.1%; smoked 1–9 cigarettes/day), and Heavier smokers (17.4%; smoked ?10 cigarettes/day). Anthropometry was recorded on the adult daughters at approximately 26.0 years of age. Obesity was defined as BMI ?30 kg/m 2 , and short stature as height more than two standard deviations below the population mean. Daughters whose mothers were Light and Heavier smokers in early pregnancy were 0.8 cm and 1.0 cm shorter, 2.3 kg and 2.6 kg heavier, and had BMI 0.84 kg/m 2 and 1.15 kg/m 2 greater, respectively, than daughters of Non-smokers. The adjusted relative risk of short stature was 55% higher in women born to smokers, irrespectively of smoking levels. Maternal smoking had a dose-dependent association with obesity risk, with offspring of Heavier smokers 61% and of Light smokers 37% more likely to be obese than the daughters of Non-smokers. In conclusion, maternal smoking in pregnancy was associated with an increased risk of short stature and obesity in their adult daughters. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

"Influence of altered geometry and material properties on tissue stress distribution under load in tendinopathic Achilles tendons – A subject-specific finite element analysis",2019,"Achilles tendon material properties and geometry are altered in Achilles tendinopathy. The purpose of this study was to determine the relative contributions of altered material properties and geometry to free Achilles tendon stress distribution during a sub-maximal contraction in tendinopathic relative to healthy tendons. Tendinopathic (n = 8) and healthy tendons (n = 8) were imaged at rest and during a sub-maximal voluntary isometric contraction using three-dimensional freehand ultrasound. Images were manually segmented and used to create subject-specific finite element models. The resting cross-sectional area of the free tendon was on average 31% greater for the tendinopathic compared to healthy tendons. Material properties for each tendon were determined using a numerical parameter optimisation approach that minimised the difference in experimentally measured longitudinal strain and the strain predicted by the finite element model under submaximal loading conditions for each tendon. The mean Young's modulus for tendinopathic tendons was 53% lower than the corresponding control value. Finite element analyses revealed that tendinopathic tendons experience 24% less stress under the same submaximal external loading conditions compared to healthy tendons. The lower tendon stress in tendinopathy was due to a greater influence of tendon cross-sectional area, which alone reduced tendon stress by 30%, compared to a lower Young's modulus, which alone increased tendon stress by 8%. These findings suggest that the greater tendon cross-sectional area observed in tendinopathy compensates for the substantially lower Young's modulus, thereby protecting pathological tendon against excessive stress. ? 2018","Elastic moduli; Finite element method; Geometry; Strain; Stress analysis; Stress concentration; Ultrasonics; Achilles tendinopathy; Cross sectional area; Isometric contractions; Longitudinal strain; Numerical parameters; Relative contribution; Tendinopathy; Von Mises; Tendons; achilles tendinitis; achilles tendon; adult; Article; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; female; finite element analysis; human; image segmentation; male; muscle isometric contraction; muscle mass; priority journal; tendon stress; three dimensional imaging; triceps surae muscle; Young modulus; biological model; biomechanics; case control study; finite element analysis; mechanical stress; pathology; pathophysiology; tendinitis; weight bearing; Achilles Tendon; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Case-Control Studies; Elastic Modulus; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Male; Patient-Specific Modeling; Stress, Mechanical; Tendinopathy; Weight-Bearing"
"The Use of a Brief, Active Visualisation Intervention to Improve Adherence to Antiretroviral Therapy in Non-adherent Patients in South Africa",2019,"Non-adherence remains the largest cause of treatment failure to antiretroviral therapy (ART). Despite having the largest HIV pandemic, few successful adherence interventions have been conducted in South Africa. Active visualisation is a novel intervention approach that may help effectively communicate the need for consistent adherence to ART. The current study tested an active visualisation intervention in a sample of non-adherent patients. 111 patients failing on first- or second-line ART were recruited from two sites in the Western Cape, South Africa. Participants were randomly allocated to receive the intervention or standard care (including adherence counselling). The primary outcome was adherence as measured by plasma viral load (VL). There was a clinically significant difference (p = 0.06) in VL change scores between groups from baseline to follow-up, where the intervention had a greater decrease in log VL (Madj = ? 1.92, CI [? 2.41, ? 1.43), as compared to the control group (Madj = ? 1.24, [? 1.76, ? 0.73]). Participants in the intervention group were also significantly more likely to have a 0.5 log improvement in VL at follow-up (χ(1)2 = 4.82, p = 0.028, ? = 0.28). This study provides initial evidence for the utility of this novel, brief intervention as an adjunct to standard adherence counselling, for improving adherence to ART. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; antiretroviral therapy; article; controlled study; counseling; female; follow up; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; plasma; randomized controlled trial; South Africa; treatment failure; virus load; blood; drug effect; highly active antiretroviral therapy; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; medication compliance; middle aged; patient compliance; South Africa; virology; virus load; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; virus RNA; Adult; Anti-HIV Agents; Antiretroviral Therapy, Highly Active; Counseling; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Patient Compliance; RNA, Viral; South Africa; Treatment Failure; Viral Load"
"New Zealand health system: universalism struggles with persisting inequities",2019,"New Zealand was one of the first countries to establish a universal, tax-funded national health service. Unique features include innovative M?ori services, the no-fault accident compensation scheme, and the Pharmaceutical Management Agency, which negotiates with pharmaceutical companies to get the best value for medicines purchased by public money. The so-called universal orientation of the health system, along with a strong commitment to social service provision, have contributed to New Zealand's favourable health statistics. However, despite a long-standing commitment to reducing health inequities, problems with access to care persist and the system is not delivering the promise of equitable health outcomes for all population groups. Primary health services and hospital-based services have developed largely independently, and major restructuring during the 1990s did not produce the expected efficiency gains. A focus on individual-level secondary services and performance targets has been prioritised over tackling issues such as suicide, obesity, and poverty-related diseases through community-based health promotion, preventive activities, and primary care. Future changes need to focus on strengthening the culture and capacity of the system to improve equity of outcomes, including expanding M?ori health service provision, integrating existing services and structures with new ones, aligning resources with need to achieve pro-equity outcomes, and strengthening population-based approaches to tackling contemporary drivers of health status. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","accident; child care; funding; health care; health care disparity; health insurance; health personnel attitude; human; New Zealand; non profit organization; pharmaceutical care; primary health care; priority journal; Review; secondary health care; economics; financial management; government; health care delivery; New Zealand; organization and management; public health; statistics and numerical data; Financing, Government; Government Programs; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; National Health Programs; New Zealand; Universal Health Insurance"
"Stigma and the in(visible) perspectives and expectations of home oxygen therapy among people with chronic breathlessness syndrome: A qualitative study",2019,"Background: Chronic breathlessness syndrome in the context of advancing disease is distressing for all concerned. Oxygen is commonly prescribed in this setting; however, little is known about the perspectives of breathless people who either are on oxygen or are yet to have it prescribed. Aim: To understand and describe the perspectives and experiences of breathless people towards oxygen use at home. Design: This qualitative study utilised an interpretive description approach using semi-structured interviews and thematic analysis. Setting/participants: A total of 19 people with chronic breathlessness syndrome living in South Australia participated in semi-structured interviews. Participants were divided into sub-groups according to whether they were chronically breathless and (1) not using home oxygen (n = 6), (2) using funded home oxygen for severe hypoxaemia (n = 7) and (3) using home oxygen for palliation outside of funding guidelines (n = 6). Results: Three main themes were identified: (1) managing distress and living with chronic breathlessness syndrome, with or without oxygen, requires a range of self-management strategies; (2) expectations of oxygen use: ‘Not as good as I thought it would be’; and (3) the stigma of using oxygen: the visible and invisible. Conclusion: People living with chronic breathlessness struggle daily with both the progression of the underlying disease and the distressing nature of the syndrome. While oxygen does provide benefit for some people, its use and the perceptions of its use are often associated with both the visible and invisible manifestations of stigma. Clinicians need to promote self-management strategies and give careful thought to the prescribing of home oxygen, especially outside the current funding guidelines. ?

"Acceptance and Cognitive Reappraisal as Regulation Strategies for Symptom Annoyance in Individuals with Medically Unexplained Physical Symptoms",2019,"Emotion processing has been demonstrated to have a strong impact on somatic symptom perception. In the current quasi-experimental trial associations between the application of emotion regulation strategies and symptom-related outcomes were examined in subjects with medically unexplained physical symptoms (MUS; n = 48) and in mentally healthy individuals (n = 48). Somatic symptoms were repeatedly induced four times in both samples. After each symptom induction, participants were instructed to apply another of four emotion regulation strategies. Symptom-related outcomes were rated before and after a strategy was applied. Hierarchical linear models showed that in the MUS group cognitive reappraisal was significantly and acceptance was marginally associated with lower symptom annoyance scores compared with compassionate self-support. In healthy subjects distraction was associated with better mood scores compared with compassionate self-support. Future research should examine the effects of acceptance and cognitive reappraisal strategies applied by MUS subjects over a longer period of time. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; annoyance; article; clinical article; controlled study; emotionality; female; human; human experiment; male; medically unexplained symptom; mood"
"Stability of vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride and etoposide phosphate admixtures in polyisoprene elastomeric pump supporting transition of the EPOCH regimen to outpatient care",2019,"Background: The EPOCH regimen, consisting of vincristine sulfate, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and etoposide phosphate, is typically administered by continuous infusion over four days to oncology inpatients. If the EPOCH regimen was available to be administered through portable elastomeric pumps, chemotherapy could be transitioned to an outpatient setting, reducing inpatient bed days and overall healthcare costs. However, a lack of stability data for the admixtures in the elastomeric infusion devices currently prevents the transition of the regime to an outpatient setting. The purpose of this study is to determine the physical and chemical stability of the admixture in polyisoprene elastomeric pumps under different storage conditions to support the transition of the EPOCH regime to an outpatient setting. Methods: The physico-chemical stability of three admixtures at a range of clinically relevant concentrations compounded in polyisoprene elastomeric infusors was determined when refrigerated at 2–6℃ over a 14-day period followed by 35℃ up to 7 days in the dark, and under standardized fluorescent light to simulate scenarios in clinical practice. Results: All tested admixtures were compatible and the drugs were stable in the elastomeric infusors for up to 14 days when stored at 2–6℃ followed by 7 days at 35℃ in the dark, with nominal losses of <5%. The major degradant of etoposide phosphate was its active form etoposide. There was no degradation (<1% loss) found when the admixture was exposed to a standardized fluorescent light dose of 80 klux-h (25℃) for 10 h. The temperature and light conditions the infusors were exposed to during the stability study were more severe than the conditions determine during clinical administration. Conclusion: The extended stability of the three infusional admixtures compounded in elastomeric infusion pumps demonstrated herein permits advance preparation and storage of these drugs, reducing pharmacy compounding resources. The demonstrated stability at 35℃ and under light exposure, conditions more severe than those experienced during clinical practice, support continuous infusions for up to seven days from the elastomeric infusors without a loss of potency. The proven stability of the EPOCH regimens in the tested elastomeric infusion device supports the transition of treatment to an outpatient setting which will reduce inpatient bed days and overall healthcare costs. ?

"‘People haven’t got that close connection’: meanings of loneliness and social isolation to culturally diverse older people",2019,"Objectives: Social isolation and loneliness among older people are known to have negative effects on health and wellbeing. Few studies, however, have enabled older people to define these concepts in their own terms. This paper based on research in Aotearoa, New Zealand is the first to comparatively outline the meanings of loneliness and social isolation from the perspective of four ethnically diverse groups of older adults (M?ori, Pacific, Asian, and NZ European). Method: We interviewed 44 older people and conducted three focus groups with 32 older people. We used thematic and narrative analyses. Results: Loneliness and social isolation were conceptualized as interconnected concepts described as a ‘look and feel’, a ‘state of mind’ and as a ‘lack of desired companionship’. Participants conveyed sophisticated understandings of the structural underpinnings of both loneliness and social isolation as multi-dimensional, complex, and situated. Conclusions: Older people describe complex and culturally- nuanced understanding and experience of social isolation and loneliness. More culturally appropriate services, greater mental-health support and more service provision on weekends and evenings are needed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","aged; article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; loneliness; male; mental health; narrative; New Zealand; social isolation"
"Hearing-health intervention for nightclub staff",2019,"Objective: Sound levels in nightclubs are dangerously high. We administered the Dangerous Decibels hearing-health intervention to nightclub staff to test its efficacy. Design: In a single group, repeated measures were taken before training, a week after training and at 3 months after training. Setting: A nightclub in the city of Auckland, New Zealand. Method: We delivered training to 20 people who work in nightclubs: bar staff, disc jockeys (DJs), security staff and police. We assessed supports and barriers towards hearing-health behaviour, knowledge, attitudes and self-reported behaviour at the three time points. Results: The ratio of supports to barriers for good hearing-health behaviour improved 1 week after training and continued to improve at 3 months. Participants’ knowledge increased after training and was maintained 3 months later. Attitudes and self-reported behaviour did not change. Conclusion: The continued improvement in supports-to-barriers ratio at 3 months post-training has not been observed previously and may reflect a change in participants’ thinking as a result of the intervention. The lack of change in self-reported behaviour implies that the effect of acculturation to loud music in nightclubs was not wholly overcome. ?

"The ‘will to give’: corporations, philanthropy and schools",2019,"In contemporary times, corporate philanthropy is positioned as an effective means to ‘solve’ a variety of social problems. Childhood obesity is one such ‘problem’ that has captured the interests of schools, corporations, industry groups and a number of ‘not-for-profit’ players. In this paper, I critically examine how the private sector uses the notion of philanthropy to shape school-based solutions to obesity and unhealthy lifestyles. By conducting a critical ethnography in two New Zealand primary schools and drawing on Foucauldian notions of government and ‘practices of assemblage’, I illuminate how a number of organisations officially planned to employ philanthropy as a means to govern others, as well as what actually happened when these plans met their intended targets: children, teachers and principals. Although corporations, charities and schools were assembled together through their combined ‘will to give’, the notion of philanthropy helped to re-assemble and re-invent private sector organisations so that they were seen to be socially responsible, healthy, and even educational. Philanthropy also worked to mask private sector players less altruistic interests: branding, public relations strategies, avoidance of stricter regulations and legislation, and the desire to profit. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Prevalence and Determinants of QuantiFERON-Diagnosed Tuberculosis Infection in 9810 Mongolian Schoolchildren",2019,"Background: There is controversy regarding the potential influence of vitamin D deficiency, exposure to environmental tobacco smoke, BCG vaccination, season, and body habitus on susceptibility to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional analysis to identify determinants of a positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) assay result in children aged 6-13 years attending 18 schools in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. Data relating to potential risk factors for MTB infection were collected by questionnaire, physical examination, and determination of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations. Risk ratios (RRs) were calculated with adjustment for potential confounders, and population attributable fractions (PAFs) were calculated for modifiable risk factors identified. Results: Nine hundred forty-six of 9810 (9.6%) participants had a positive QFT result. QFT positivity was independently associated with household exposure to pulmonary tuberculosis (adjusted RR [aRR], 4.75 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 4.13-5.46, P <. 001]; PAF, 13.1% [95% CI, 11.1%-15.0%]), vitamin D deficiency (aRR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.08-1.40], P =. 002; PAF, 5.7% [95% CI, 1.9%-9.3%]), exposure to environmental tobacco smoke (1 indoor smoker, aRR, 1.19 [95% CI, 1.04-1.35]; ?2 indoor smokers, aRR, 1.30 [95% CI, 1.02-1.64]; P for trend =. 006; PAF, 7.2% [95% CI, 2.2%-12.0%]), and increasing age (aRR per additional year, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.10-1.19], P <. 001). No statistically significant independent association was seen for presence of a BCG scar, season of sampling, or body mass index. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke are potentially modifiable risk factors for MTB infection. ? 2018 The Author(s) 2018.","25 hydroxyvitamin D; BCG vaccine; tobacco smoke; age; Article; BCG vaccination; body mass; child; cross-sectional study; environmental exposure; female; household; human; immunoassay; infection risk; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; Mongolia; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); physical examination; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); sampling; school child; screening; season; skin scar; smoking; tuberculin test; vitamin blood level; vitamin D deficiency"
"Polyphonies of depression: The relationship between voices-of-the-self in young professional women aka ‘top girls’",2019,"While the analysis of depression narratives has become increasingly common practice within critical mental health research, this work rarely investigates how these accounts intersect with particular social identities. The recent emergence of the ‘top girl’ identity, a new cultural slot on offer for young women, is underpinned by the rise of neoliberal and post-feminist discourses in the Western world. To explore whether this new feminine subjectivity is indeed taken up by young women and how it shapes their experience of depression, we conducted in-depth interviews with 13 young professional women in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Based on a dialogical approach to theorising and researching subjectivity, we identified repetitive inter-relations between different voices-of-the-self and the voices of depression. The most pervasive pattern in the sample consists of what we have termed demanding voices associated with the ‘top girl’ position, which construct depression as an individual deficit thereby discouraging young women from exploring the sociocultural origins of their distress. In contrast, resistant voices emphasise relationality and a (re)connection with meaningful values and, therefore, seem to be productive for individual recovery. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""

"Expression of cathepsins B, D, and G in WHO grade i meningioma",2019,"Aim: We have recently demonstrated the presence of putative tumor stem cells (TSCs) in World Health Organization (WHO) grade I meningioma (MG) localized to the microvessels, which expresses components of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). The RAS is known to be dysregulated and promotes tumorigenesis in many cancer types, including glioblastoma. Cathepsins B, D, and G are isoenzymes that catalyze the production of angiotensin peptides, hence providing bypass loops for the RAS. This study investigated the expression of cathepsins B, D, and G in WHO grade I MG in relation to the putative TSC population we have previously demonstrated. Methods: 3,3-Diaminobenzidine (DAB) immunohistochemical (IHC) staining with antibodies for cathepsins B, D, and G was performed on WHO grade I MG tissue samples from 10 patients. Three of the MG samples subjected to DAB IHC staining underwent immunofluorescence (IF) IHC staining to investigate co-expression of each of these cathepsins using combinations of smooth muscle actin (SMA) and embryonic stem cell marker OCT4. NanoString mRNA expression (n = 6) and Western blotting (WB; n = 5) analyses, and enzyme activity assays (EAAs; n = 3), were performed on snap-frozen WHO grade I MG tissue samples to confirm transcriptional activation, protein expression, and functional activity of these proteins, respectively. Results: DAB IHC staining demonstrated expression of cathepsins B, D, and G in all 10 MG samples. NanoString mRNA expression and WB analyses showed transcriptional activation and protein expression of all three cathepsins, although cathepsin G was expressed at low levels. EAAs demonstrated that cathepsin B and cathepsin D were functionally active. IF IHC staining illustrated localization of cathepsin B and cathepsin D to the endothelium and SMA+ pericyte layer of the microvessels, while cathepsin G was localized to cells scattered within the interstitium, away from the microvessels. Conclusion: Cathepsin B and cathepsin D, and to a lesser extent cathepsin G, are expressed in WHO grade I MG. Cathepsin B and cathepsin D are enzymatically active and are localized to the putative TSC population on the microvessels, whereas cathepsin G was localized to cells scattered within the interstitium, These results suggest the presence of bypass loops for the RAS, within WHO grade I MG. ? 2019 Rahman, van Schaijik, Brasch, Marsh, Wickremesekera, Johnson, Woon, Tan and Itinteang.",""
"Channelopathies That Lead to Sudden Cardiac Death: Clinical and Genetic Aspects",2019,"Forty per cent (40%) of sudden unexpected natural deaths in people under 35 years of age are associated with a negative autopsy, and the cardiac ion channelopathies are the prime suspects in such cases. Long QT syndrome (LQTS), Brugada syndrome (BrS) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) are the most commonly identified with genetic testing. The cellular action potential driving the heart cycle is shaped by a specific series of depolarising and repolarising ion currents mediated by ion channels. Alterations in any of these currents, and in the availability of intracellular free calcium, leaves the myocardium vulnerable to polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Each channelopathy has its own electrocardiogram (ECG) signature, typical mode of presentation, and most commonly related gene. Long QT type 1 (gene, KCNQ1) and CPVT (gene, RyR2) typically present with cardiac events (ie syncope or cardiac arrest) during or immediately after exercise in young males; long QT type 2 (gene, KCNH2) after startle or during the night in adult females-particularly early post-partum, and long QT type 3 and Brugada syndrome (gene, SCN5A) during the night in young adult males. They are commonly misdiagnosed as seizure disorders. Fever-triggered cardiac events should also raise the suspicion of BrS. This review summarises genetics, cellular mechanisms, risk stratification and treatments. Beta blockers are the mainstay of treatment for long QT syndrome and CPVT, and flecainide is remarkably effective in CPVT. Brugada syndrome is genetically a more complex disease than the others, and risk stratification and management is more difficult. ? 2018","potassium channel KCNQ1; ryanodine receptor 2; sodium channel Nav1.5; arrhythmogenesis; Brugada syndrome; catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; disease association; early repolarization syndrome; electrocardiography; electrophysiology; gene; gene expression; genotype phenotype correlation; heart cycle; heart muscle conduction disturbance; heart muscle excitability; heart muscle potential; heart ventricle fibrillation; human; KCNH2 gene; KCNQ1 gene; long QT syndrome 1; long QT syndrome 2; long QT syndrome 3; long QT syndrome 5; missense mutation; modifier gene; pathophysiology; prevalence; priority journal; QRS complex; QT interval; Review; RyR2 gene; SCN5A gene; ST segment depression; sudden cardiac death; T wave; channelopathy; complication; genetic screening; genetics; procedures; sudden cardiac death; Channelopathies; Death, Sudden, Cardiac; Genetic Testing; Humans"
"Intensity and duration of lifestyle interventions for long-term weight loss and association with mortality: A meta-analysis of randomised trials",2019,"Objectives To evaluate the importance of the frequency and duration of lifestyle interventions for achieving weight loss over ?1 year and associations with all-cause mortality. Design Meta-analysis of randomised trials using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and RevMan software version 5·2 (The Nordic Cochrane Centre, The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen). Data sources MEDLINE, CENTRAL, Google and Science Direct databases alongside reference lists of appropriate articles and meta-analyses. Eligibility criteria Randomised studies published in English-language journals from 1980 to June 2018 that assessed lifestyle compared with control interventions on weight loss and that included ?100 subjects and reported weight change and mortality for ?1 year. Data extraction and synthesis Two independent reviewers extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Data were pooled using the generic inverse-variance method and expressed as mean differences (MDs) with 95% CI and OR with 95% CI as appropriate. Heterogeneity was assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified (I 2 statistic). The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation score was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. Results 31 randomised trials with a total of 20 816 overweight or obese participants were included. 70% of participants had cardiometabolic risk factors. Body weight was lower for lifestyle intervention compared with the control at 1 year (3.63 kg, 95% CI 2.58 to 4.67) and at 3 years (2.45 kg, 95% CI 1.17 to 3.73).

In all studies, there were 593 deaths (?0.3%/year). The ORs for mortality for weight loss interventions compared with the controls was 0.86 (95% CI 0.73 to 1.02), p=0.09. Conclusion In predominantly healthy populations with risk factors, there is a dose response with number of lifestyle interventions and weight loss. Frequent and sustained interventions are needed to achieve a clinically significant 5% weight loss. There was insufficient evidence to reliably evaluate the benefits in persons with known cardiovascular disease or cancer. ? 2019 Author(s).","all cause mortality; Article; body weight; body weight loss; cardiometabolic risk; human; lifestyle; meta analysis; obese patient; obesity; randomized controlled trial (topic)"
"Antenatal and Postnatal Determinants of Behavioural Difficulties in Early Childhood: Evidence from Growing Up in New Zealand",2019,"Behavioural difficulties during early childhood have significant implications for multiple outcomes later in life. Child behavioural difficulties at 2?years of age (N = 6246) were assessed by mothers enrolled in a longitudinal, population-based New Zealand cohort study. 10.1% of children had total difficulties scores in the abnormal range on the preschool version of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. After controlling for maternal education, poverty, and child’s birth age/weight, several antenatal and postnatal maternal health and family risk factors were significant for: (i) emotional problems (antenatal maternal perceived stress, lack of periconceptional folate, and moderate to severe maternal postnatal anxiety); (ii) hyperactivity-inattention (antenatal maternal?perceived stress,?mothers’ antenatal exposure to secondhand smoke, moderate to severe maternal postnatal anxiety, and low maternal self-evaluation); (iii) conduct problems and total difficulties (antenatal maternal perceived stress, verbal inter-parental conflict and low maternal self-evaluation). The identification of risk and protective factors associated with early childhood difficulties are vital for guiding intervention and prevention efforts. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","adult; behavior disorder; child behavior; cohort analysis; female; human; male; mental disease; mother; New Zealand; onset age; perinatal care; pregnancy; preschool child; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; social psychiatry; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Age of Onset; Child Behavior; Child Behavior Disorders; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Mothers; New Zealand; Perinatal Care; Pregnancy; Preventive Psychiatry; Psychopathology; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires"

"The effect of atropine on human global flash mfERG responses to retinal defocus",2019,"PURPOSE. To investigate the action of atropine on global flash multifocal electroretinogram (gmfERG) responses to retinal defocus. METHOD. gmfERG recordings were made monocularly in 19 healthy adults under three lens-imposed defocus conditions (2 diopters myopic, 2 diopters hyperopic, and no defocus) before and 24 hours after instillation of 1 drop of 0.1% atropine. Signals reflecting activity from the outer and inner retina (direct [DC] and induced [IC] components respectively) were analyzed. Responses were grouped into either a central (08–68) or peripheral (68–248) retinal zone. The gmfERG responses were compared relative to the no defocus, no atropine condition. RESULTS. Within the central zone, atropine had no effect on the amplitudes and peak times of DC or IC responses to defocus. For IC responses in the peripheral zone, there was a significant interaction effect of atropine and defocus (F 2,36 = 6.050, P = 0.011) with greater post-atropine amplitudes under myopic defocus (mean increase = 15.5%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.6%–25.4%, P = 0.004). Atropine also had a significant main effect of increasing IC peak times (F 1,18 = 9.722, P = 0.006). For DC responses, atropine had a significant main effect of increasing DC amplitudes (F 1,18 = 7.821, P = 0.012) and peak times (F 1,18 = 15.406, P = 0.001) regardless of sign of defocus. CONCLUSIONS. Our results imply that atropine acts in the inner layers of the peripheral retina to affect neuronal responses to myopic defocus, raising the possibility that atropine may potentiate the effects of myopic defocus in inhibiting eye growth. ? 2019 The Authors.","atropine; cycloplegic agent; tropicamide; atropine; muscarinic receptor blocking agent; adult; Article; clinical article; current amplitude; electrophysiology; electroretinography; emmetropia; female; human; hypermetropia; lens; male; myopia; optometry; priority journal; refraction error; retina disease; retinal defocus; two-dimensional imaging; young adult; drug effect; electroretinography; intraocular drug administration; pathophysiology; photostimulation; radiation response; retina; Administration, Ophthalmic; Adult; Atropine; Electroretinography; Female; Humans; Hyperopia; Male; Muscarinic Antagonists; Myopia; Photic Stimulation; Retina; Young Adult"
"Cost-effectiveness of community-based childhood obesity prevention interventions in Australia",2019,"Objectives: The objective of this study is to examine, from a limited societal perspective, the cost-effectiveness of community-based obesity prevention interventions (CBIs)-defined as a programme of community-level strategies to promote healthy eating and physical activity for Australian children (aged 5–18 years). Methods: The effectiveness of CBIs was determined by undertaking a literature review and meta-analysis. Commonly implemented strategies to increase physical activity and improve nutrition were costed (in 2010 Australian dollars) to determine the average cost of a generic programme. A multiple cohort Markov model that simulates diseases associated with overweight and obesity was used to estimate the health benefits, measured as health-adjusted life years (HALYs) and healthcare-related cost offsets from diseases averted due to exposure to the intervention. Health and cost outcomes were estimated over the lifetime of the target population. Monte-Carlo simulation was used to assess second-order uncertainty of input parameters to estimate mean incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) with 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs). Scenario analyses tested variations in programme intensity, target population, and duration of effect. Results: The meta-analysis revealed a small but significant difference in BMI z-score (mean difference of ? 0.07 (95% UI: ? 0.13 to ? 0.01)) favouring the CBI community compared with the control. The estimated net cost of implementing CBIs across all local government areas (LGAs) in Australia was AUD426M (95% UI: AUD3M to AUD823M) over 3 years. This resulted in 51,792 HALYs gained (95% UI: 6816 to 96,972) over the lifetime of the cohort. The mean ICER was AUD8155 per HALY gained (95% UI: AUD237 to AUD81,021), with a 95% probability of being cost-effective at a willingness to pay threshold of AUD50,000 per HALY. Conclusions: CBIs are cost-effective obesity prevention initiatives; however, implementation across Australia will be (relatively) expensive when compared with current investments in preventive health. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","adolescent; adult; Article; Australia; body mass; child; childhood obesity; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; community care; comparative study; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; government; health adjusted life year; health care cost; healthy diet; human; major clinical study; Monte Carlo method; physical activity; preventive health service; priority journal; Willingness To Pay"
"Design and methods of Shape up under 5: Integration of systems science and community-engaged research to prevent early childhood obesity",2019,"Shape Up Under 5 (SUU5) was a two-year early childhood obesity prevention pilot study in Somerville, Massachusetts (2015–2017) designed to test a novel conceptual framework called Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion. For whole-of-community interventions, this framework posits that diffusion of stakeholders’ knowledge about and engagement with childhood obesity prevention efforts through their social networks will improve the implementation of health-promoting policy and practice changes intended to reduce obesity risk. SUU5 used systems science methods (agent-based modeling, group model building, social network analysis) to design, facilitate, and evaluate the work of 16 multisector stakeholders (‘the Committee’). In this paper, we describe the design and methods of SUU5 using the conceptual framework: the approach to data collection, and methods and rationale for study inputs, activities and evaluation, which together may further our understanding of the hypothesized processes within Stakeholder-driven Community Diffusion. We also present a generalizable conceptual framework for addressing childhood obesity and similar complex public health issues through whole-of-community interventions. ? 2019 Appel et al.

"Stillbirth research: Recruitment barriers and participant feedback",2019,"Background: Prioritisation of stillbirth research in high-income countries is required to address preventable stillbirth. However, concern is raised by ethics committees, maternity providers and families, when pregnant and bereaved women are approached to participate. Our aim was to 1) assess factors influencing recruitment in a multicentre case-control stillbirth study and 2) gain insight into how women felt about their participation. Methods: Eligible women were contacted through maternity providers from seven New Zealand health regions in 2011-2015. Cases had a recent singleton non-anomalous late stillbirth (?28 weeks’ gestation). Controls were randomly selected and matched for region and gestation. Participants were interviewed by a research midwife and given a feedback form asking their views about participation. Feedback was evaluated using thematic analysis. Results: 169 (66.5%) of 254 eligible cases and 569 (62.2%) of 915 eligible controls were recruited. Non-participants consisted of 263 (22.5% of eligible) women who declined, 108 (9.2% of eligible) uncontactable women, and 60 (5.1% of eligible) women declined by the maternity provider, with no significant differences between the proportion of non-participating cases and controls in each of these three categories. The majority (63.2%) of women did not provide a specific reason for non-participation. Written feedback was provided by 111 participants (cases 15.3%, controls 14.9%) and all described their involvement positively. Feedback themes identified were ‘motivation to participate,’ ‘ease of participation,’ and ‘post-participation positivity.’ Conclusion: Identification of recruitment barriers and our reassuring participant feedback may assist women's participation in future research and support progress towards stillbirth prevention. ? 2019 The Authors","adult; article; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; midwife; motivation; multicenter study; New Zealand; pregnancy; pregnant woman; randomized controlled trial; stillbirth; thematic analysis"
"Influences and policies that affect immunisation coverage-a summary review of literature",2019,"Effective national immunisation programmes require a high proportion of the population to be immunised. Although New Zealand has made significant progress towards immunisation goals over the last two decades, immunisation coverage remains inadequate to prevent intermittent outbreaks of disease, and immunisation inequities persist between geographic, ethnic and socioeconomic groups. Here we summarise a recent literature review that was conducted to identify and examine key factors that influence immunisation coverage, timeliness of vaccinations and the core drivers that affect vaccine uptake. We conclude that well designed systems, taking a holistic approach with multiple components, gain broader community acceptance and trust; early and continual engagement with well-informed healthcare professionals builds trust and improves uptake; the family's experience during vaccination events is important; community-led vaccine advocacy is required to target specific populations to help to promote and improve access to immunisation. Coercive approaches can be marginally effective, but risk disproportionately penalising those already experiencing mistrust and hardship.",""
"Can we further optimize therapeutic hypothermia for hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy?",2019,"Perinatal hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is a leading cause of neonatal death and disability. Therapeutic hypothermia significantly reduces death and major disability associated with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy; however, many infants still experience lifelong disabilities to movement, sensation and cognition. Clinical guidelines, based on strong clinical and preclinical evidence, recommend therapeutic hypothermia should be started within 6 hours of birth and continued for a period of 72 hours, with a target brain temperature of 33.5 ± 0.5°C for infants with moderate to severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. The clinical guidelines also recommend that infants be rewarmed at a rate of 0.5°C per hour, but this is not based on strong evidence. There are no randomized controlled trials investigating the optimal rate of rewarming after therapeutic hypothermia for infants with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Preclinical studies of rewarming are conflicting and results were confounded by treatment with sub-optimal durations of hypothermia. In this review, we evaluate the evidence for the optimal start time, duration and depth of hypothermia, and whether the rate of rewarming after treatment affects brain injury and neurological outcomes. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Medknow Publications.

"Adverse events from large dose vitamin D supplementation taken for one year or longer",2019,"In recent years, clinical trials increasingly have given large doses of vitamin D supplements to investigate possible health benefits beyond bone at high 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels. However, there are few publications on the safety of high-dose vitamin D given long term. The study objective was to investigate the cumulative relative risk (RR) of total adverse events, kidney stones, hypercalcemia and hypercalciuria from ?2800 IU/d vitamin D 2 or D 3 supplementation, followed for one year or more in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic review was conducted in Medline Ovid, EMBASE and Cochrane in March 2018 to update results of studies published since a previous review in October 2015. RCTs were included if they gave vitamin D 2 or D 3 at ?2800 IU/d for at least one year and reported on total adverse events or at least one calcium-related adverse event. There were a total of 32 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Of these, only 15 studies (3150 participants) reported one or more event of the outcomes of interest. Long-term high-dose vitamin D supplementation did not increase total adverse events compared to placebo in 1731 participants from 10 studies (RR = 1.05; 95% CI = 0.88, 1.24; p = 0.61), nor kidney stones in 1336 participants from 5 studies (RR = 1.26; 95% CI = 0.35, 4.58; p = 0.72). However, there was a trend for vitamin D to increase risk of hypercalcemia in 2598 participants from 10 studies (RR = 1.93; 95% CI = 1.00, 3.73; p = 0.05); while its effect on hypercalciuria in only 276 participants from 3 studies was inconclusive (RR = 1.93; 95% CI = 0.83, 4.46; p = 0.12). In conclusion, one year or longer supplementation with a large daily, weekly or monthly dose of vitamin D 2 /D 3 did not significantly increase a risk of total adverse events or kidney stones, although there was a trend towards increased hypercalcemia, and possibly for hypercalciuria. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","vitamin D; vitamin; vitamin D; adverse event; drug efficacy; drug megadose; drug safety; drug tolerability; human; hypercalcemia; hypercalciuria; long term care; nephrolithiasis; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; vitamin supplementation; chemically induced; clinical trial (topic); dietary supplement; hypercalcemia; hypercalciuria; meta analysis; nephrolithiasis; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Hypercalcemia; Hypercalciuria; Kidney Calculi; Vitamin D; Vitamins"
"Glucoregulatory activity of vesiculin in insulin sensitive and resistant mice",2019,"Pancreatic islet-derived peptide hormones play key roles in the maintenance of systemic energy homeostasis and glucose balance and defects in their regulation are strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity and diabetes. Peptides have also been used as lead compounds for therapeutics targeting metabolic disease. It is therefore important to understand the activity and function of islet hormones in both their target tissues and the whole organism. Insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II)is an insulin homolog secreted by the islet β-cells. Vesiculin is a newly discovered peptide hormone, processed from IGF-II and secreted from islet β-cells in response to glucose. We postulated that vesiculin might act to regulate systemic glucose metabolism. Here we report our original investigations of vesiculin's activity in relation to glucoregulation. Vesiculin and IGF-II displayed similar dose-response relationships for lowering blood glucose in insulin-responsive FVB/n mice. By contrast, the ability of IGF-II to lower blood glucose was blunted in insulin-resistant triprolyl human-amylin transgenic mice, whereas vesiculin's ability to lower blood glucose remained unaffected. We also confirmed the ability of vesiculin to bypass insulin resistance in a second mouse model. In vitro analysis of signalling by vesiculin and IGF-II indicates that, like IGF-II, vesiculin signals through the IR/ IGF1R. Overall, we show that removal of only four amino acids from IGF-II has generated a peptide hormone with different bioactivity relevant to blood-glucose regulation. Investigating the differences among vesiculin, IGF-II and insulin signalling and activity may provide new insights into insulin resistance and potentially inform the design of novel therapeutics ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","glucose; insulin derivative; peptide hormone; somatomedin B; somatomedin C receptor; unclassified drug; vesiculin; animal experiment; Article; biological activity; controlled study; dose response; drug potency; FVB/N mouse; glucose blood level; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; insulin signaling; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; transgenic mouse"

"How differing methods of ascribing ethnicity and socio-economic status affect risk estimates for hospitalisation with infectious disease",2019,"Significant ethnic and socio-economic disparities exist in infectious diseases (IDs) rates in New Zealand, so accurate measures of these characteristics are required. This study compared methods of ascribing ethnicity and socio-economic status. Children in the Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal cohort were ascribed to self-prioritised, total response and single-combined ethnic groups. Socio-economic status was measured using household income, and both census-derived and survey-derived deprivation indices. Rates of ID hospitalisation were compared using linked administrative data. Self-prioritised ethnicity was simplest to use. Total response accounted for mixed ethnicity and allowed overlap between groups. Single-combined ethnicity required aggregation of small groups to maintain power but offered greater detail. Regardless of the method used, M?ori and Pacific children, and children in the most socio-economically deprived households had a greater risk of ID hospitalisation. Risk differences between self-prioritised and total response methods were not significant for M?ori and Pacific children but single-combined ethnicity revealed a diversity of risk within these groups. Household income was affected by non-random missing data. The census-derived deprivation index offered a high level of completeness with some risk of multicollinearity and concerns regarding the ecological fallacy. The survey-derived index required extra questions but was acceptable to participants and provided individualised data. Based on these results, the use of single-combined ethnicity and an individualised survey-derived index of deprivation are recommended where sample size and data structure allow it. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press.","Article; bacterial infection; child; child development; cohort analysis; controlled study; data analysis; ecological fallacy; economic aspect; ethnicity; female; geographic distribution; health disparity; hospitalization; household income; human; infant; infection; information processing; longitudinal study; major clinical study; mycosis; New Zealand; parasitosis; questionnaire; risk assessment; sample size; social determinants of health; social status; socioeconomics; virus infection"

"The ENHANCES study: a randomised controlled trial of a nurse-led survivorship intervention for patients treated for head and neck cancer",2019,"Purpose: A randomised controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-delivered Head and Neck Cancer Survivor Self-Management Care Plan (HNCP) for patients who had completed treatment for head and neck cancer (HNC). Methods: Ten oncology nurses were trained to deliver the HNCP. The HNCP consisted of one face-to-face hour-long meeting in which the patient’s treatment was recorded, as were contact details of health professionals involved in their care and follow-up schedules. Patients were guided to nominate up to three goals for their future well-being and assisted to devise an action plan to achieve these. The HNCP was given to the patient and a copy was forwarded to their primary care physician. One hundred and nine patients were randomised after definitive curative intent treatment, 36 to HNCP, 36 to receive information about survivorship, and 37 to usual care. The primary outcome, analysed by intention-to-treat, was change in quality of life measured by the FACT-H&N from baseline to 6-month follow-up. Results: Quality of life of all groups decreased at 3?months but was close to baseline at 6?months. Compared with the usual care group, the only statistically significant mean difference at 6?months was for the information group on the physical well-being domain (mean difference 0.4, 95% ? 1.8, 2.6, p < 0.05). Conclusions: A single-session nurse-delivered intervention is insufficient to improve the quality of life in HNC survivors compared with usual care.

"The effect of implementing an aseptic practice bundle for anaesthetists to reduce postoperative infections, the Anaesthetists Be Cleaner (ABC) study: Protocol for a stepped wedge, cluster randomised, multi-site trial",2019,"Background: Postoperative infection is a serious problem in New Zealand and internationally with considerable human and financial costs. Also, in New Zealand, certain factors that contribute to postoperative infection are more common in Maori and Pacific populations. To date, most efforts to reduce postoperative infection have focussed on surgical aspects of care and on antibiotic prophylaxis, but recent research shows that anaesthesia providers may also have an impact on infection transmission. These providers sometimes exhibit imperfect hand hygiene and frequently transfer the blood or saliva of their patients to their work environment. In addition, intravenous medications may become contaminated whilst being drawn up and administered to patients. Working with relevant practitioners and other experts, we have developed an evidence-informed bundle to improve key aseptic practices by anaesthetists with the aim of reducing postoperative infection. The key elements of the bundle are the filtering of compatible drugs, context-relevant hand hygiene practices and enhanced maintenance of clean work surfaces. Methods: We will seek support for implementation of the bundle from senior anaesthesia and hospital leadership and departmental ""champions"". Anaesthetic teams and recovery room staff will be educated about the bundle and its potential benefits through presentations, written material and illustrative videos. We will implement the bundle in operating rooms where hip or knee arthroplasty or cardiac surgery procedures are undertaken in a five-site, stepped wedge, cluster randomised, quality improvement design. We will compare outcomes between approximately 5000 cases before and 5000 cases after implementation of our bundle. Outcome data will be collected from existing national and hospital databases. Our primary outcome will be days alive and out of hospital to 90 days, which is expected to reflect all serious postoperative infections. Our secondary outcome will be the rate of surgical site infection. Aseptic practice will be observed in sampled cases in each cluster before and after implementation of the bundle. Discussion: If effective, our bundle may offer a practical clinical intervention to reduce postoperative infection and its associated substantial human and financial costs.

"Removal of various contaminants from water by renewable lignocellulose-derived biosorbents: a comprehensive and critical review",2019,"Contaminants in water bodies cause potential health risks for humans and great environmental threats. Therefore, the development and exploration of low-cost, promising adsorbents to remove contaminants from water resources as a sustainable option is one focus of the scientific community. Here, we conducted a critical review regarding the application of pristine and modified/treated biosorbents derived from leaves for the removal of various contaminants. These include potentially toxic cationic and oxyanionic metal ions, radioactive metal ions, rare earth elements, organic cationic and anionic dyes, phosphate, ammonium, and fluoride from water media. Similar to lignocellulose-based biosorbents, leaf-based biosorbents exhibit a low specific surface area and total pore volume but have abundant surface functional groups, high concentrations of light metals, and a high net surface charge density. The maximum adsorption capacity of biosorbents strongly depends on the operation conditions, experiment types, and adsorbate nature. The absorption mechanism of contaminants onto biosorbents is complex; therefore, typical experiments used to identify the primary mechanism of the adsorption of contaminants onto biosorbents were thoroughly discussed. It was concluded that byproduct leaves are renewable, biodegradable, and promising biosorbents which have the potential to be used as a low-cost green alternative to commercial activated carbon for effective removal of various contaminants from the water environment?in the real-scale plants. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Biosorption; Cellulose; Contamination; Costs; Fluorine compounds; Health risks; Lignin; Metal ions; Metals; Plants (botany); Radioactive elements; Rare earths; Water treatment; Adsorption mechanism; Biosorbents; Cationic and anionic dyes; Commercial activated carbons; Critical review; Leaf; Potential health risks; Surface functional groups; Activated carbon treatment; absorbent; lanthanide; lignocellulose; metal ion; absorption; activated carbon; adsorption; byproduct; cellulose; chemical pollutant; concentration (composition); experimental study; ion; leaf area; lignin; pollutant removal; water resource; water treatment; adsorption; adsorption kinetics; Article; biomass; biosorption; chelation; complex formation; crystal structure; desorption; ionic strength; isotherm; particle size; pH; plant leaf; reduction (chemistry); regeneration; static electricity; surface property; thermodynamics; thermostability; waste component removal; waste water management; water contamination; water supply"
"The “healthy dose” of nature: A cautionary tale",2019,"Growing cross-disciplinary interest in understanding if, how, and why time spent with nature can contribute to human health and well-being has recently prompted efforts to identify an ideal healthy dose of nature; exposure to a specific type of nature at a specified frequency and duration. These efforts build on longstanding attempts to prescribe nature in some way, most recently in the form of so-called “green prescriptions.” In this critical discussion paper, we draw on key examples from within the fields of health and cultural geography to encourage deeper and more critical reflection on the value of such reductionist dose-response frameworks. By foregrounding the relationally emergent qualities of people's dynamic nature encounters, we suggest such efforts may be both illusory and potentially exclusionary for the many individuals and groups whose healthy nature interactions diverge from the statistical average or “normal” way of being. We suggest value in working towards alternative more-than-human approaches to health and well-being, drawing on posthumanist theories of social practice. We present two practice examples—beach-going and citizen science—to demonstrate how a focus on social practices can better cater for the diverse and dynamic ways in which people come to conceptualise, embody, and interpret nature in their everyday lives. We close by reflecting on the wider societal transformations required to foster greater respect for embodied difference and diversity. ? 2018 The Authors Geography Compass Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","cultural geography; greenspace; health geography; quality of life"
"Food store environment examination – FoodSee: a new method to study the food store environment using wearable cameras",2019,"Introduction: Food environments shape food behaviours and are implicated in rising rates of obesity worldwide. Measurement of people’s interactions with food stores is important to advance understanding of the associations between the food environment and in-store behaviour. This paper describes a new method, Food Store Environment Examination (FoodSee) to measure people’s interaction with the food store environment in a feasibility study focused on convenience stores and children. Methods: One hundred and sixty-eight randomly selected children (aged 11–13 years) recruited from 16 randomly selected schools in Wellington, New Zealand, used wearable cameras for 4 days that recorded images every 7 s. The study was conducted from July 2014 to June 2015. All images of convenience stores and service stations, and a sample of images from supermarkets, were evaluated to determine the feasibility of assessing food availability and marketing. The outcomes of interest assessed were: food product availability, placement, packaging, branding, price promotion, purchases and consumption. Results: Thirty-seven children (22%) visited a convenience store or service station at least once during the study period. In total, there were 65 visits to 34 different stores. Seven hundred and nineteen images revealed the in-store environment. Of those, 86.1% were usable and able to be analysed for the outcomes of interest. Conclusions: The FoodSee methodology provides a promising new method to study people’s interaction with the in-store food environment. The evidence generated will be valuable in understanding and improving the food store environment within which people shop, and will contribute to efforts to address obesity globally. ?

"Nutritional strategies to prevent lens cataract: Current status and future strategies",2019,"Oxidative stress and the subsequent oxidative damage to lens proteins is a known causative factor in the initiation and progression of cataract formation, the leading cause of blindness in the world today. Due to the role of oxidative damage in the etiology of cataract, antioxidants have been prompted as therapeutic options to delay and/or prevent disease progression. However, many exogenous antioxidant interventions have to date produced mixed results as anti-cataract therapies. The aim of this review is to critically evaluate the efficacy of a sample of dietary and topical antioxidant interventions in the light of our current understanding of lens structure and function. Situated in the eye behind the blood-eye barrier, the lens receives it nutrients and antioxidants from the aqueous and vitreous humors. Furthermore, being a relatively large avascular tissue the lens cannot rely of passive diffusion alone to deliver nutrients and antioxidants to the distinctly different metabolic regions of the lens. We instead propose that the lens utilizes a unique internal microcirculation system to actively deliver antioxidants to these different regions, and that selecting antioxidants that can utilize this system is the key to developing novel nutritional therapies to delay the onset and progression of lens cataract. ? 2019 by the authors.

"CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA) gene haploinsufficiency does not alter hematopoiesis or induce leukemia in lck-CALM/AF10 transgenic mice",2019,"Although rare, CALM/AF10 is a chromosomal rearrangement found in immature T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), acute myeloid leukemia, and mixed phenotype acute leukemia of T/myeloid lineages with poor prognosis. Moreover, this translocation is detected in 50% of T-ALL patients with gamma/delta T cell receptor rearrangement, frequently associated with low expression of transcription factor CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (CEBPA). However, the relevance of CEBPA low expression for CALM/AF10 leukemogenesis has not yet been evaluated. We generated double mutant mice, which express the Lck-CALM/AF10 fusion gene and are haploinsufficient for the Cebpa gene. To characterize the hematopoiesis, we quantified hematopoietic stem cells, myeloid progenitor cells, megakaryocyte-erythrocyte progenitor cells, common myeloid progenitor cells, and granulocyte-macrophage progenitor cells. No significant difference was detected in any of the progenitor subsets. Finally, we tested if Cebpa haploinsufficiency would lead to the expansion of Mac-1+/B220+/c-Kit+ cells proposed as the CALM/AF10 leukemic progenitor. Less than 1% of bone marrow cells expressed Mac-1, B220, and c-Kit with no significant difference between groups. Our results showed that the reduction of Cebpa gene expression in Lck-CALM/AF10 mice did not affect their hematopoiesis or induce leukemia. Our data corroborated previous studies suggesting that the CALM/AF10 leukemia-initiating cells are early progenitors with lymphoid/myeloid differentiating potential. ? 2019, Associacao Brasileira de Divulgacao Cientifica.

"The Acute Effect of High-Intensity Exercise on Executive Function: A Meta-Analysis",2019,"High-intensity exercise has recently emerged as a potent alternative to aerobic regimens, with ramifications for health and brain function. As part of this trend, single sessions of intense exercise have been proposed as powerful, noninvasive means for transiently enhancing cognition. However, findings in this field remain mixed, and a thorough synthesis of the evidence is lacking. Here, we synthesized the literature in a meta-analysis of the acute effect of high-intensity exercise on executive function. We included a total of 1,177 participants and 147 effect sizes across 28 studies and found a small facilitating effect (d = 0.24) of high-intensity exercise on executive function. However, this effect was significant only compared with rest (d = 0.34); it was not significant when high-intensity exercise was compared with low-to-moderate intensity exercise (d = 0.07). This suggests that intense and moderate exercise affect executive function in a comparable manner. We tested a number of moderators that together explained a significant proportion of the between-studies variance. Overall, our findings indicate that high-intensity cardiovascular exercise might be a viable alternative for eliciting acute cognitive gains. We discuss the potential of this line of research, identify a number of challenges and limitations it faces, and propose applications to individuals, society, and policies. ?

"An open label pilot study of a dexmedetomidine-remifentanil-caudal anesthetic for infant lower abdominal/lower extremity surgery: The T REX pilot study",2019,"Background: Concern over potential neurotoxicity of anesthetics has led to growing interest in prospective clinical trials using potentially less toxic anesthetic regimens, especially for prolonged anesthesia in infants. Preclinical studies suggest that dexmedetomidine may have a reduced neurotoxic profile compared to other conventional anesthetic regimens; however, coadministration with either anesthetic drugs (eg, remifentanil) and/or regional blockade is required to achieve adequate anesthesia for surgery. The feasibility of this pharmacological approach is unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility of a remifentanil/dexmedetomidine/neuraxial block technique in infants scheduled for surgery lasting longer than 2?hours. Methods: Sixty infants (age 1-12?months) were enrolled at seven centers over 18?months. A caudal local anesthetic block was placed after induction of anesthesia with sevoflurane. Next, an infusion of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil commenced, and the sevoflurane was discontinued. Three different protocols with escalating doses of dexmedetomidine and remifentanil were used. Results: One infant was excluded due to a protocol violation and consent was withdrawn prior to anesthesia in another. The caudal block was unsuccessful in two infants. Of the 56 infants who completed the protocol, 45 (80%) had at least one episode of hypertension (mean arterial pressure >80?mm?Hg) and/or movement that required adjusting the anesthesia regimen. In the majority of these cases, the remifentanil and/or dexmedetomidine doses were increased although six infants required rescue 0.3% sevoflurane and one required a propofol bolus. Ten infants had at least one episode of mild hypotension (mean arterial pressure 40-50?mm?Hg) and four had at least one episode of moderate hypotension (mean arterial pressure <40?mm?Hg). Conclusion: A dexmedetomidine/remifentanil neuraxial anesthetic regimen was effective in 87.5% of infants. These findings can be used as a foundation for designing larger trials that assess alternative anesthetic regimens for anesthetic neurotoxicity in infants. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","dexmedetomidine; glycopyrronium; propofol; remifentanil; sevoflurane; anesthetic agent; dexmedetomidine; remifentanil; sevoflurane; abdominal surgery; anesthesia induction; Article; bradycardia; caudal anesthesia; child; clinical trial; continuous infusion; disease severity; drug dose escalation; drug dose increase; drug efficacy; feasibility study; female; human; hypertension; hypotension; infant; leg amputation; loading drug dose; local anesthesia; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; mean arterial pressure; multicenter study; open study; pilot study; postoperative pain; priority journal; abdomen; anesthesia; caudal anesthesia; lower limb; procedures; surgery; Abdomen; Anesthesia; Anesthesia, Caudal; Anesthetics, Combined; Dexmedetomidine; Female; Humans; Infant; Lower Extremity; Male; Pilot Projects; Remifentanil; Sevoflurane"
"Female subfertility",2019,"Subfertility is common and affects one in six couples, half of whom lack an explanation for their delay in conceiving. Developments in the diagnosis and treatment of subfertility over the?past 50 years have been truly remarkable. Indeed, current generations of couples with subfertility are more fortunate than previous generations, as they have many more opportunities to become parents. The timely access to effective treatment for subfertility is important as many couples have a narrow window of opportunity before the age-related effects of subfertility limit the likelihood of success. Assisted reproduction can overcome the barriers to fertility caused by tubal disease and low sperm count, but little progress has been made in reducing the effect of increasing age on ovarian function. The next 5–10 years will likely see further increases in birth rates in women with subfertility, a greater awareness of lifestyle factors and a possible refinement of current assisted reproduction techniques and the development of new ones. Such progress will bring challenging questions regarding the potential benefits and harms of treatments involving germ cell manipulation, artificial gametes, genetic screening of embryos and gene editing of embryos. We hope to see a major increase in fertility awareness, access to safe and cost-effective fertility care in low-income countries and a reduction in the current disparity of access to?fertility?care. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.","age; diagnostic procedure; endometriosis; epidemiological data; female; female fertility; female subfertility; human; hysterosalpingography; in vitro fertilization; infertility therapy; intrauterine insemination; lifestyle; lowest income group; medical history; oocyte; ovarian reserve; ovary cyst; ovary insufficiency; ovulation; pathophysiology; patient safety; pelvic disease; peritoneum; physical examination; premature ovarian failure; priority journal; quality of life; Review; risk factor; screening test; social psychology; tubal patency test; uterine tube disease; uterus cavity; uterus disease; uterus myoma; adult; female infertility; mass screening; middle aged; procedures; risk reduction; fertility promoting agent; Adult; Age Factors; Female; Fertility Agents; Humans; Hysterosalpingography; Infertility, Female; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Risk Reduction Behavior"

"Hydrogen cross-feeders of the human gastrointestinal tract",2019,"Hydrogen plays a key role in many microbial metabolic pathways in the human gastrointestinal tract (GIT) that have an impact on human nutrition, health and wellbeing. Hydrogen is produced by many members of the GIT microbiota, and may be subsequently utilized by cross-feeding microbes for growth and in the production of larger molecules. Hydrogenotrophic microbes fall into three functional groups: sulfate-reducing bacteria, methanogenic archaea and acetogenic bacteria, which can convert hydrogen into hydrogen sulfide, methane and acetate, respectively. Despite different energy yields per molecule of hydrogen used between the functional groups, all three can coexist in the human GIT. The factors affecting the numerical balance of hydrogenotrophs in the GIT remain unconfirmed. There is increasing evidence linking both hydrogen sulfide and methane to GIT diseases such as irritable bowel syndrome, and strategies for the mitigation of such health problems through targeting of hydrogenotrophs constitute an important field for further investigation. ? 2018, ? 2018 The Author(s).

"Measurement properties of the SF-MPQ-2 neuropathic qualities subscale in persons with CRPs: Validity, responsiveness, and Rasch analysis",2019,"Objectives. The purpose of this study was to conduct classical psychometric evaluation and Rasch analysis on the Neuropathic Qualities subscale of the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire-2 utilizing scores from persons with complex regional pain syndrome to consider reliability and person separation, validity (including unidimensionality), and responsiveness in this population. Methods. Secondary analysis of longitudinal data from persons with acute complex regional pain syndrome was utilized for analysis of the psychometric properties and fit to the Rasch model of the Neuropathic Qualities subscale. We followed an iterative process of Rasch analysis to evaluate and address data fitting challenges. Results. Repeated measures from 59 persons meeting the Budapest criteria were used for analysis. Both item-total correlations and unidimensionality analyses supported theoretical construct validity; all convergent construct validity hypotheses were also supported. Responsiveness was demonstrated comparing baseline and one-year data at d ? 0.92, with a standardized response mean of 0.97. Data were able to fit the Rasch model, but all Neuropathic Qualities items had disordered thresholds that required rescoring. Additionally, local dependency and differential item function were addressed by “bundling,” suggesting that no further item reduction would be possible. Conclusions. This study provided preliminary support for the validity and responsiveness of the Neuropathic Qualities subscale in persons with complex regional pain syndrome. Rasch analysis further endorses use of the Neuropathic Qualities subscale as a “stand-alone” measure for neuropathic features, but with substantial background data transformations. Replication with larger samples is recommended to increase confidence in these findings. ? 2018 American Academy of Pain Medicine.

"Characterisation of DNA methylation changes in EBF3 and TBC1D16 associated with tumour progression and metastasis in multiple cancer types",2019,"Background: Characteristic DNA methylation differences have been identified between primary and metastatic melanomas at EBF3 and/or TBC1D16 gene loci. To further evaluate whether these epigenetic changes may act more generally as drivers of tumour onset and metastasis, we have investigated DNA methylation changes involving EBF3 and TBC1D16 in additional publicly available data of multiple different tumour types. Results: Promoter hypermethylation and gene body hypomethylation of EBF3 were observed in a number of metastatic tumour types, when compared to normal or primary tumour tissues, as well as in tumour vs normal tissues and in a colorectal primary/metastasis pair, although not all tumour samples or primary/metastasis cancer pairs exhibited altered patterns of EBF3 methylation. In addition, hypomethylation of TBC1D16 was observed in multiple tumours, including a breast cancer primary/metastasis pair, and to a lesser degree in melanoma, although again not all tumours or cancer primary/metastasis pairs exhibited altered patterns of methylation. Conclusions: These findings suggest characteristic DNA methylation changes in EBF3 and TBC1D16 are relatively common tumour-associated epigenetic events in multiple tumour types, which is consistent with a potential role as more general drivers of tumour progression. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; breast cancer; clinical feature; colorectal cancer; CpG island; DNA methylation; EBF3 gene; endometrium cancer; epigenetics; gene; gene sequence; genetic association; genome; human; melanoma; metastasis; multiple cancer; primary tumor; priority journal; promoter region; prostate cancer; risk factor; TBC1D16 gene; tumor growth"
"On the analysis of two-phase designs in cluster-correlated data settings",2019,"In public health research, information that is readily available may be insufficient to address the primary question(s) of interest. One cost-efficient way forward, especially in resource-limited settings, is to conduct a two-phase study in which the population is initially stratified, at phase I, by the outcome and/or some categorical risk factor(s). At phase II detailed covariate data is ascertained on a subsample within each phase I strata. While analysis methods for two-phase designs are well established, they have focused exclusively on settings in which participants are assumed to be independent. As such, when participants are naturally clustered (eg, patients within clinics) these methods may yield invalid inference. To address this, we develop a novel analysis approach based on inverse-probability weighting that permits researchers to specify some working covariance structure and appropriately accounts for the sampling design and ensures valid inference via a robust sandwich estimator for which a closed-form expression is provided. To enhance statistical efficiency, we propose a calibrated inverse-probability weighting estimator that makes use of information available at phase I but not used in the design. In addition to describing the technique, practical guidance is provided for the cluster-correlated data settings that we consider. A comprehensive simulation study is conducted to evaluate small-sample operating characteristics, including the impact of using na?ve methods that ignore correlation due to clustering, as well as to investigate design considerations. Finally, the methods are illustrated using data from a one-time survey of the national antiretroviral treatment program in Malawi. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; article; calibration; controlled study; covariance; human; intermethod comparison; Malawi; phase 1 clinical trial; probability; risk factor; sampling; scientist; simulation"
"Research priorities for childhood chronic conditions: A workshop report",2019,"Chronic conditions are the leading cause of mortality, morbidity and disability in children. However, children and caregivers are rarely involved in identifying research priorities, which may limit the value of research in supporting patient-centred practice and policy. Objective To identify priorities of patients, caregivers and health professionals for research in childhood chronic conditions and describe the reason for their choices. Setting An Australian paediatric hospital and health consumer organisations. Methods Recruited participants (n=73) included patients aged 8 to 14 years with a chronic condition (n=3), parents/caregivers of children aged 0 to 18 years with a chronic condition (n=19), representatives from consumer organisations (n=13) and health professionals including clinicians, researches (n=38) identified and discussed research priorities. Transcripts were thematically analysed. Results Seventy-eight research questions were identified. Five themes underpinned participants' priorities: maintaining a sense of normality (enabling participation in school, supporting social functioning, promoting understanding and acceptance), empowering self-management and partnership in care (overcoming communication barriers, gaining knowledge and skills, motivation for treatment adherence, making informed decisions, access and understanding of complementary and alternative therapies),strengthening ability to cope (learning to have a positive outlook, preparing for home care management, transitioning to adult services), broadening focus to family (supporting sibling well-being, parental resilience and financial loss, alleviating caregiver burden), and improving quality and scope of health and social care (readdressing variability and inequities, preventing disease complications and treatment side effects, identifying risk factors, improving long-term outcomes, harnessing technology, integrating multidisciplinary services). Conclusion Research priorities identified by children, caregivers and health professionals emphasise a focus on life participation, psychosocial well-being, impact on family and quality of care. These priorities may be used by funding and policy organisations in establishing a paediatric research agenda. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use.

"In situ and invasive melanoma in a high-risk, New Zealand, population: A population-based study",2019,"Background: Few population-based studies assess both invasive and in?situ melanoma. We document all patients with a first biopsied melanoma in a general population in New Zealand (NZ). Methods: All residents in a defined area of New Zealand with a biopsy showing a new primary invasive or in?situ melanoma from 2010 to 2012 were identified, 974 patients; analysis used multivariate methods. Results: Age-standardised incidence rates were 34.3 in females (F) and 41.4 in males (M) for invasive, 20.9 F and 27.6 M for in?situ, and 55.2 F and 69.0 M for total melanoma. More in?situ melanoma occurred in older patients and on the head and neck. Geometric mean Breslow thickness for invasive was 0.78?mm F and 0.85?mm M, with thicker lesions at ages over 60 and on the lower limb; there was no significant relationship with sex, distance from care or social deprivation assessed from residential address. Nodular melanomas (15%) were more frequent in older and male patients, and on the limbs, and were thicker. The estimated cumulative risk for melanoma is 4.4% F and 4.6% M by age 70. The body site distribution and sex differences were consistent with sun exposure patterns. Estimated incidence of melanoma in New Zealand in 2018 is 2500 invasive and 1700 in?situ cases. Conclusions: Assessing both in?situ and invasive melanoma expands the clinical picture, better estimating health care demand and costs. Results suggest that in?situ disease is a more slowly growing lesion than the early phase of invasive disease.

"Acetaminophen pharmacokinetics in severely obese adolescents and young adults",2019,"Background: Intravenous acetaminophen is commonly administered as an adjunctive to opioids during major surgical procedures, but neither the correct pharmacokinetic size descriptor nor the dose is certain in severely obese adolescents undergoing bariatric surgery. Methods: Adolescents, 14-20?years of age, with a body mass index (BMI) ?95th percentile for age and sex or BMI ?40?kg·m ?2 , presenting for laparoscopic or robotic assisted or vertical sleeve gastrectomy were administered intravenous acetaminophen (1000?mg) following completion of the surgical procedure. Venous blood was drawn for acetaminophen assay at eight time points, starting 15?minutes after completion of the infusion and up to 12?hours afterward. Time-concentration data profiles were analyzed using nonlinear mixed effects models. Parameter estimates were scaled to a 70-kg person using allometry. Normal fat mass was used to assess the impact of obesity on pharmacokinetic parameters. Results: The study cohort comprised 11 female patients, age 17 SD 2?years with a weight of 125 SD 19?kg and a mean BMI of 46 SD 5?kg·m ?2 . The plasma acetaminophen serum concentration was 17 (SD 4) μg·mL ?1 at 10-20?minutes after completion of the infusion and 5 (SD 6) μg·mL ?1 at 80-100?minutes.

"Time to Full Enteral Feeding for Very Low-Birth-Weight Infants Varies Markedly Among Hospitals Worldwide But May Not Be Associated With Incidence of Necrotizing Enterocolitis: The NEOMUNE-NeoNutriNet Cohort Study",2019,"Background: Transition to enteral feeding is difficult for very low-birth-weight (VLBW; ?1500 g) infants, and optimal nutrition is important for clinical outcomes. Method: Data on feeding practices and short-term clinical outcomes (growth, necrotizing enterocolitis [NEC], mortality) in VLBW infants were collected from 13 neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) in 5 continents (n = 2947). Specifically, 5 NICUs in Guangdong province in China (GD), mainly using formula feeding and slow feeding advancement (n = 1366), were compared with the remaining NICUs (non-GD, n = 1581, Oceania, Europe, United States, Taiwan, Africa) using mainly human milk with faster advancement rates. Results: Across NICUs, large differences were observed for time to reach full enteral feeding (TFF; 8–33 days), weight gain (5.0–14.6 g/kg/day), ?z-scores (?0.54 to ?1.64), incidence of NEC (1%–13%), and mortality (1%–18%). Adjusted for gestational age, GD units had longer TFF (26 vs 11 days), lower weight gain (8.7 vs 10.9 g/kg/day), and more days on antibiotics (17 vs 11 days; all P <.001) than non-GD units, but NEC incidence and mortality were similar. Conclusion: Feeding practices for VLBW infants vary markedly around the world. Use of formula and long TFF in South China was associated with more use of antibiotics and slower weight gain, but apparently not with more NEC or higher mortality. Both infant- and hospital-related factors influence feeding practices for preterm infants.

"Repurposing a rare opportunity: A brief insight into how implicit bias towards biomedicine impacts the care received by patients with a rare illness",2019,"Medical students automatically couple rare illnesses with biomedical minutiae. Upon meeting CS (pseudonym), a 5-year-old boy with Worster Drought Syndrome, I became inadvertently caught in the trap of focusing on his diagnosis rather than CS as a patient. I fumbled around CS's past medical history by fervently asking about all the different types of seizures he was plagued by. It was only after CS's mother, TS (pseudonym), volunteered the psychosocial challenges she faced caring for CS that I realised the strong implicit bias I had towards biomedical aspects of patient care. I discovered that TS was robbed of being able to celebrate CS's developmental milestones, as they posed unique challenges with very serious risks. Having learned the extent of such psychosocial challenges, I searched to understand the origin of biases towards biomedicine, within myself and within the medical system. I attribute my own biases in part to the current state of medical education, which disproportionately focuses on the scientific, rather than psychosocial and humanistic factors. Systemically, there is a large commercial driving force behind scientific research into rare illnesses. The interest in rare illnesses displayed by pharmaceutical industries only after the incentivisation by various countries highlight the socio-political constraints that bind research in this field. These biases, along with the marginalisation of patients and families with rare illnesses, means there is a very real risk that the goals of all stakeholders are incongruous. As such, it is imperative that we give these patients and families a voice. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; biomedicine; drug industry; drug repositioning; genetic disorder; health care; health care delivery; human; medical education; medical history; medical research; patient care; politics; psychosocial care; rare disease; risk factor; seizure; statistical bias; Worster Drought Syndrome; medicine; pathology; psychology; rare disease; statistical bias; Bias; Delivery of Health Care; Education, Medical; Humans; Medicine; Psychology; Rare Diseases"
"Overlay repair with a synthetic collagen scaffold improves the quality of healing in a rat rotator cuff repair model",2019,"Background: Augmenting repairs with extracellular matrix–based scaffolds is a common option for rotator cuff tears. In this study, a new collagen scaffold was assessed for its efficacy in augmenting rotator cuff repair. Methods: The collagen scaffold was assessed in vitro for cytocompatibility and retention of tenocyte phenotype using alamarBlue assays, fluorescent imaging, and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Immunogenicity was assessed in vitro by the activation of human monocytes. In vivo, by use of a modified rat rotator cuff defect model, supraspinatus tendon repairs were carried out in 40 animals. Overlay augmentation with the collagen scaffold was compared with unaugmented repairs. At 6 and 12 weeks postoperatively, the repairs were tested biomechanically to evaluate repair strength, as well as histologically to assess quality of healing. Results: The collagen scaffold supported human tendon-derived cell growth in vitro, with cells demonstrating proliferation and appearing morphologically tenocytic over the experimental period. No immunogenic responses were provoked compared with suture material control. In vivo, augmentation with the scaffold improved the histologic scores at 12 weeks (8.4 of 15 vs 6.4 of 15, P =.032). However, no significant difference was detected with mechanical testing. Conclusion: The new collagen scaffold was supportive of cell growth in vitro and generated a minimal acute inflammatory response. In vivo, we observed an improvement in the histologic appearance of the repair at 12 weeks. However, a meaningful increase in biomechanical strength was not achieved. Further modification and improvement of the scaffold are required prior to consideration for clinical use. ? 2018 Journal of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery Board of Trustees","alkaline phosphatase; collagen; collagen type 1; collagen type 3; decorin; scleraxis protein; suture material; transcription factor Sox9; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biomechanics; cell growth; collagen fiber; controlled study; fluorescence; gene expression; hamstring tendon; healing; human; human cell; humerus; immunogenicity; in vitro study; monocyte; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; rotator cuff rupture; supraspinatus muscle; tendon reconstruction; animal; disease model; extracellular matrix; physiology; rotator cuff injury; Sprague Dawley rat; tissue scaffold; wound healing; Animals; Biomechanical Phenomena; Collagen; Disease Models, Animal; Extracellular Matrix; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rotator Cuff Injuries; Tissue Scaffolds; Wound Healing"
"Effects of results-based financing of maternal and child health services on patient satisfaction in Afghanistan",2019,"Objective: To examine the impact of a results-based financing programme on patient satisfaction in Afghanistan. Methods: We analysed data collected from over 3000 patients from a stratified sample of 112 health facilities (56 results-based financing and 56 non-results-based financing) in 11 out of the 34 provinces of Afghanistan over a three-year period. The 112 facilities were part of 442 primary care facilities that were stratified on facility type and randomly assigned to the results-based financing (intervention) and non-results-based financing (control) groups in the 11 provinces. Data were obtained from the National Health Service Performance Assessment, a baseline survey of patients conducted in 2010, and two follow-up surveys in 2011 and 2012. Measurement of patient satisfaction used a questionnaire comprising 11 questions concerning overall satisfaction, and satisfaction with specific aspects of care, from provider behaviour (e.g. respectfulness, communication) to cleanliness, opening hours and waiting times of facilities. We used a regression adjusted difference-in-differences estimator to investigate the treatment effect on patient satisfaction at facility level. Results: There were some improvements in patient satisfaction in results-based financing facilities but these were not statistically significant. In 2011, 2 out of 11 aspects of satisfaction showed 5% improvement: satisfaction with the way health care providers explained the patient’s condition and treatment. In 2012, patient satisfaction was higher for almost all aspects of care in results-based financing facilities, including the two aspects on health care provider respectfulness and facility opening hours, which had been 5% lower in results-based financing facilities than in non-results-based financing facilities in 2011. Overall satisfaction was almost 10% higher in results-based financing facilities than in non-results-based financing facilities in 2012. Conclusion: Even if not statistically significant, observed trends suggest some positive impacts of the results-based financing programme on patient satisfaction. ?

"Telomere length in early childhood is associated with sex and ethnicity",2019,"Telomeres are repetitive DNA sequences at the end of chromosomes that function to protect chromosomes from degradation. Throughout the life course, telomere length decreases with age and is influenced by environmental factors and health conditions. This study aimed to determine the relative telomere lengths in a diverse cohort of about 4000 four-year-old children in New Zealand. Linear regression was used to investigate the relationship between telomere length, child gender, ethnicity, paternal age and deprivation. We observed substantial variation in telomere length according to sex and self-identified ethnicity. Telomere length was longer in females compared to males (coefficient of 0.042, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.024–0.060). European children had shorter telomere than both the indigenous M?ori (coefficient of 0.03, CI 0.007–0.055) and Pacific children (coefficient of 0.15, CI 0.12–0.18). The data suggest that telomere lengths are highly variable and variability between individuals arise from early age, influenced partly by sex and ethnicity. Longer telomeres in indigenous M?ori and Pacific children may reflect the heritability of telomere length in genetically less complex populations. This study increases our understanding of telomere dynamics in young children since the majority of telomere studies are conducted in adults. ? 2019, The Author(s).","adult; article; child; childhood; cohort analysis; controlled study; ethnicity; European; female; gender; heritability; human; infant; linear regression analysis; male; New Zealand; paternal age; telomere length"
"Implication of obesity on motion, posture and internal stress of the foot: an experimental and finite element analysis",2019,"Obesity causes increased loading on the foot which can damage the soft tissue and bone ultimately leading to foot problems. Experimental and computational methods were used to analyse the chain of biomechanical changes in the lower limb due to obesity. The experimental study shows some changes in foot posture and gait where obese subjects were more likely to have pronated feet, smaller joint angles in the sagittal and frontal planes, smaller cadence, and smaller stride length. Anatomically correct finite element models generated on obese subjects showed increased and altered internal and plantar stress. ?Altered foot posture was identified as a key indicator of increased internal stress indicating the importance of foot posture correction. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Gait analysis; Nutrition; Biomechanical changes; Finite element modelling; Foot biomechanics; foot posture; Foot problems; Frontal planes; Obesity; Stride length; Finite element method; adult; Article; biomechanics; body mass; body position; body weight; bone injury; bone structure; clinical article; controlled study; female; finite element analysis; flatfoot; foot; foot pressure; gait; human; image analysis; kinematics; knee function; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; pressure measurement; priority journal; range of motion; soft tissue; stress; tissue injury; valgus knee; walking; anatomic model; body position; finite element analysis; foot; mechanical stress; motion; obesity; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; pressure; young adult; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Finite Element Analysis; Foot; Gait; Humans; Male; Models, Anatomic; Motion; Obesity; Posture; Pressure; Stress, Mechanical; Young Adult"

"Child obesity prevalence across communities in New Zealand: 2010–2016",2019,"Objective: To assess community-level differences in four-year-old obesity prevalence in New Zealand (NZ), trends over time, and the extent to which differences can be explained by ethnicity, deprivation and urbanicity. Methods: Obesity measures from the Ministry of Health’s B4 School Check were available for 72–92% of NZ four-year-olds for fiscal years 2010/11–2015/16. Ethnicity, deprivation and urbanicity data for the 78 communities were obtained by linking to administrative records. Growth models were used to examine variability in obesity levels and trends over time, and the extent to which ethnicity, deprivation and urbanicity contributed to differences between communities. Results: There were large variations in obesity across communities (range 8.4% to 28.8%). A decline in the prevalence of childhood obesity was observed in most (48 of 78) communities from 2010/11 to 2015/16 (average change=0.2%, range=-2.0% to 1.9%). Around 50% of the variance in obesity between territorial authorities could be explained by differences in socioeconomic deprivation and ethnic composition. Conclusions: Child obesity varies between NZ communities, but most territorial authorities have experienced a decrease in obesity over the period 2010/11–2015/16. Implications for public health: Addressing deprivation and ethnic inequalities in obesity could substantially reduce community-level differences in obesity in NZ. ? 2019 The Authors","body mass; child; childhood obesity; demography; ethnic group; ethnology; female; health disparity; human; male; New Zealand; preschool child; prevalence; questionnaire; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Body Mass Index; Child; Child, Preschool; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Pediatric Obesity; Prevalence; Residence Characteristics; Socioeconomic Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Trials with proxy-reported outcomes registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR)",2019,"Aims: A proxy is someone other than a patient who reports a patient’s outcomes as if they are the patient. Due to known discordance with patient reports, proxies are often not recommended in clinical trials; however, proxies may be needed in certain research contexts. We aimed to identify and describe trials registered on the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ANZCTR) with proxy-reported endpoints. Methods: ANZCTR was systematically searched from inception (2005) to 31 March 2017 for trials with proxy-reported endpoints. Primary and secondary endpoints for each trial retrieved by the search were individually coded (proxy-reported: yes/no), and trials with confirmed proxy-reported endpoints were included in the analysis. Results: Of 13,666 registered trials, 469 (3.4%) included a proxy-reported endpoint (867 individual proxy-reported endpoints in total: 62% family member proxy, 22% health professional). Proxy endpoint inclusion did not significantly increase over time (r = 0.18, p = 0.59). Mental health (11.5%), stroke (10.3%) and neurological (8.3%) trials had the highest proportion of trials using proxies. Of the 469 trials, 123 (26.2%) studies involved paediatric patients. Discussion: Proxy-reported endpoints are included in a small but notable number of studies, which may indicate other types of outcomes are used for patients unable to self-report, or that these patients are under-researched. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","accident; Africa; anesthesiology; Article; Asia; Australia; australian new zealand clinical trials registry; bibliographic database; cerebrovascular accident; childbirth; clinical outcome; clinical trial (topic); diet; diseases; ear injury; Europe; family; genetic disorder; government; health care management; health practitioner; human genetics; infection; intervention study; Ireland; malignant neoplasm; mental health; Middle East; musculoskeletal system; New Zealand; non profit organization; North America; nutrition; observational study; organization; outcome assessment; physical medicine; priority journal; proxy; public health; reproductive health; self report; social welfare; South America; surgery; United Kingdom; female; human; male; patient-reported outcome; proxy; psychology; quality of life; register; Australia; Female; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Proxy; Quality of Life; Registries"
"Do changes in weight status affect cognitive function in children and adolescents with obesity? A secondary analysis of a clinical trial",2019,"Objectives It is unclear whether an association exists between obesity in children/adolescents and cognitive function, and whether the latter can be altered by body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) reductions. We aimed to determine whether an association exists between BMI SDS and cognitive function in children/adolescents with obesity engaged in an obesity intervention. Second, we sought to determine if BMI SDS reduction at 12 months was associated with improved cognitive function. Design Secondary analysis of a clinical trial. Participants Participants (n=69) were recruited from an obesity intervention. Eligible participants (recruited June 2013 to June 2015) were aged 6-16 years, with a BMI ?98th centile or BMI >91st centile with weight-related comorbidities. Outcome measures Primary outcome measure was change in BMI SDS from baseline at 12 months. Dependent variables of cognitive functioning and school achievement were assessed at baseline and 12 months, using dependent variables of cognitive functioning (elements of Ravens Standard Progressive Matrices, Wide Range Achievement Test-fourth edition and Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-fourth edition). Results At baseline, BMI SDS was not associated with all aspects of cognitive function tested (n=69). Reductions in BMI SDS over time did not alter cognitive function overall. However, there was a greater reduction in comprehension standard scores in participants who increased their BMI SDS (adjusted estimated difference-6.1, 95% CI-11.6 to-0.6; p=0.03). Conclusions There were no observed associations between BMI SDS and cognitive function in participants, apart from comprehension in the exploratory analyses, which may have been a random finding. Further studies need to include larger longitudinal cohorts incorporating a wider BMI range at entry to determine whether our findings persist. ? 2019 Author(s).","academic underachievement; adolescent; adolescent obesity; Article; body mass; body weight; child; cognition; comorbidity; comprehension; disease association; female; human; intervention study; major clinical study; male; secondary analysis; Wechsler intelligence scale for children; Wide Range Achievement Test"
"Gut Hormone Responses to Mixed Meal Test in New-Onset Prediabetes/Diabetes after Acute Pancreatitis",2019,"The study was aimed to investigate gut hormone responses to mixed meal test in individuals with new-onset prediabetes or diabetes after acute pancreatitis (cases) compared with healthy controls, and the effect of body fat parameters. A total of 29 cases and 29 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. All participants were given standard mixed meal drink and blood samples were collected to measure dipeptidyl peptidase IV, gastric inhibitory peptide, glucagon like peptide-1, insulin, oxyntomodulin, and peptide YY. Body fat parameters were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Repeated measures and linear regression analyses were conducted in unadjusted and adjusted models. Gastric inhibitory peptide levels were significantly higher whereas oxyntomodulin levels were significantly lower in cases compared with controls in both the unadjusted (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) and adjusted (p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively) models. In cases, liver fat % contributed up to 13.4% (vs. 2.9% in controls) to variance in circulating levels of gastric inhibitory peptide whereas body mass index - up to 20.8% (vs. 9.9% in controls) in circulating levels of oxyntomodulin. New-onset prediabetes/diabetes after acute pancreatitis is characterised by increased levels of gastric inhibitory peptide and decreased levels of oxyntomodulin. Further, liver fat % and body mass index appear to be the body fat parameters that contribute most significantly to gastric inhibitory peptide and oxyntomodulin levels, respectively. ?

"Rapid increase in endometrial cancer incidence and ethnic differences in New Zealand",2019,"Purpose: Endometrial cancer accounts for 3.9% of all female cancers globally, and its incidence appears to be increasing in women under 40?years of age. This paper investigated ethnic-specific trends in endometrial cancer across different age groups in New Zealand. Methods: Women who were diagnosed with endometrial cancer between 1996 and 2012 were identified from the New Zealand Cancer Registry. Annual age-standardized incidence and mortality rates were calculated for each ethnicity (M?ori, Pacific, and non-M?ori non-Pacific) in four age groups (< 40, 40–49, 50–74, and 75 +). The estimates were adjusted for hysterectomy. Joinpoint regression analysis was used to assess trends over time and annual percentage changes (APCs) were estimated. Results: Between 1996 and 2012, age-standardized incidence rates increased in all women and significantly in the < 40, 40–49, and 50–74 age groups (APC 9.22, 3.56, and 1.65 respectively). Incidence rates were highest in Pacific women and increased most rapidly in those under 50?years of age (APC 9.36). Conversely, age-standardized mortality rates decreased in all women and significantly in the 50–74 and 75 + age groups (APC ? 5.25 and ? 5.06 respectively), with the highest rate observed in Pacific women. Conclusion: Pacific women had the highest incidence of endometrial cancer and the trend was increasing, particularly in young women. This could be attributed, at least in part, to a high and increasing rate of obesity in these women and should be explored in future research. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","adult; age; aged; Article; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer registry; controlled study; endometrium cancer; ethnic difference; female; human; hysterectomy; major clinical study; Maori (people); middle aged; mortality rate; New Zealand; Pacific Islander; priority journal; regression analysis; trend study; endometrium tumor; ethnology; incidence; obesity; population group; register; young adult; Adult; Aged; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Obesity; Population Groups; Registries; Young Adult"
"Long-term analysis of transorally resected p16 + Oropharynx cancer: Outcomes and prognostic factors",2019,"Objective: We observed high survival in a previous report of a p16-positive, oropharyngeal carcinoma (OPC) cohort treated primarily with transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) ± adjuvant therapy and followed for ? 12 months. To address long-term outcomes of primary transoral surgery for this unique disease, we present an updated analysis of our cohort with extended follow-up. Methods: A prospectively assembled TLM cohort of 171 OPC patients was analyzed for disease-free, disease-specific, and overall survival (disease-free survival [DFS], disease-specific survival [DSS], overall survival [OS]) and functional outcomes, with a minimum follow-up of 60 months or to death. Results: Median follow-up was 103 (60–201) months. Five-year DFS, DSS, and OS estimates were 85% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 80%–91%), 93% (95% CI: 89%–97%), and 90% (95% CI: 86%–95%). Recurrence occurred in 20 (12%; 7 locoregional, 13 distant); median time to recurrence was 18.8 months; and 90% occurred within 48 months. Age, smoking, American Joint Committee on Cancer 8th edition clinical tumor-category, pathologic tumor (pT)-category, pathologic tumor-node-metastasis (pTNM), and any adjuvant were significantly associated with disease-free survival in multivariable analyses, whereas pT-category, pN-category, TNM grouping, and angioinvasion were associated with DSS. A second primary developed in six (3.5%) patients. Indications for gastrostomy were recurrence/second primary (11), postadjuvant esophageal stenosis (6), comorbidities (3), and osteo/chondroradionecrosis (3); only seven (4%) had a gastrostomy tube in the absence of these factors, all of whom received adjuvant therapy. Two had a tracheostomy tube [chondoradionecrosis (1), recurrence (1)]. Conclusion: High 5-year survival and locoregional control were observed, with recurrence occurring more commonly as distant metastasis. The observed time to recurrence suggests posttreatment oncologic surveillance for at least 48 months. Identified prognosticators will inform adjuvant treatment considerations, trial planning, and patient counseling for long-term outcomes. Laryngoscope, 2018.

"Damage assessment of carbon-epoxy composites with and without resin flow channels",2019,"The integration of resin flow channels in resin transfer moulding aids manufacturers in numerous ways. They reduce total flow resistance, allowing faster filling, and provide the capability to steer resin flow within a mould. However, the presence of resin flow channels in moulded composites results in local geometric variations affecting fibre alignment. In this work, the static tension and flexural performance of composite laminates with resin flow channel(s) have been investigated. Acoustic emission monitoring was used to characterise damage. The frequency of each distinct damage event was monitored to categorise the damage. Under flexural loads, multiple channel specimens demonstrated damage initiation at lower loads and a high accumulation of AE based damage events when channels were facing the compression side of the bending loads. This study provides insight to the damage mechanism of composites with and without resin flow channels. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Acoustic emissions; Carbon fibers; Channel flow; Damage detection; Defects; Epoxy resins; Laminated composites; Resin transfer molding; Resins; Acoustic emission monitoring; Carbon-epoxy composite; Composite laminate; Damage assessments; Damage initiation; Damage mechanics; Flexural performance; Geometric variations; Acoustic emission testing"
"Transcranial Doppler Non-invasive Assessment of Intracranial Pressure, Autoregulation of Cerebral Blood Flow and Critical Closing Pressure during Orthotopic Liver Transplant",2019,"Transcranial Doppler (TCD) ultrasonography allows continuous non-invasive monitoring of cerebral blood flow velocity in a variety of clinical conditions. Recently, signal processing of TCD signals has provided several comprehensive parameters for the assessment of cerebral haemodynamics. In this work, we applied a TCD multimodal approach in patients with acute liver failure undergoing orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) to assess the clinical feasibility of using TCD for cerebral haemodynamics assessment in this setting. We retrospectively studied six patients undergoing OLT with continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure and blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery. The main cerebral haemodynamic parameters assessed were non-invasive intracranial pressure, cerebral perfusion pressure, cerebral autoregulation, pulsatility index, critical closing pressure and diastolic closing margin. TCD monitoring revealed marked alterations of these parameters in the OLT setting, which could provide relevant clinical information when there is imminent risk of neurologic impairment. ? 2019 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine & Biology","Blood pressure; Flow velocity; Noninvasive medical procedures; Signal processing; Cerebral oedema; Cerebral perfusion; Liver failure; Neuromonitoring; Transcranial Doppler; Hemodynamics; adult; area under the curve; arterial pressure; Article; autoregulation; blood flow velocity; brain blood flow; cohort analysis; controlled study; echography; feasibility study; female; hemodynamic parameters; hemodynamics; human; intracranial hypertension; intracranial pressure; liver transplantation; male; middle cerebral artery; neuromonitoring; observational study; priority journal; retrospective study; signal processing; transcranial Doppler ultrasonography; aged; brain circulation; diagnostic imaging; homeostasis; intracranial pressure; intraoperative monitoring; middle aged; physiology; procedures; Aged; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Female; Homeostasis; Humans; Intracranial Pressure; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Middle Cerebral Artery; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Retrospective Studies; Ultrasonography, Doppler, Transcranial"
"Predicting air quality from low-cost sensor measurements",2019,"Urban air pollution poses a significant global health risk, but due to the high expense of measuring air quality, the amount of available data on pollutant exposure has generally been wanting. In recent years this has motivated the development of several cheap, portable air quality monitoring instruments. However, these instruments also tend to be unreliable, and thus the raw measurements require preprocessing to make accurate predictions of actual air quality conditions, making them an apt target for machine learning techniques. In this paper we use a dataset of measurements from a low cost air-quality instrument—the ODIN-SD—to examine which techniques are most appropriate, and the limitations of such an approach. From theoretical and experimental considerations, we conclude that a robust linear regression over measurements of air quality metrics, as well as relative humidity and temperature measurements produces the model with greatest accuracy. We also discuss issues of concept drift which occur in this context, and quantify how much training data is required to strike the right balance between predictive accuracy and efficient data collection. ?

"Closure of the anterior and posterior fontanelle in the New Zealand population: A computed tomography study",2019,"Aim: Significant ethnic variation has been demonstrated in the closure of the anterior fontanelle (AF); however, to date, this has not been investigated in the M?ori/Pasifika population. Methods: The computed tomography scans of 163 individuals (116 M?ori/Pasifika and 47 New Zealand (NZ) European) aged between birth and 4 years were retrospectively analysed to investigate the surface area (SA) and time of closure of the anterior and posterior fontanelles in New Zealand. Results: The M?ori/Pasifika group showed clinical AF closure (SA &lt; 114 mm 2 ) rates of 25% at 4–6 months, increasing to 47% at 10–12 months and 80% at 13–18 months. The posterior fontanelle was clinically unfused in 17% of the M?ori/Pasifika group aged &lt;1 month and in 7% of the 1–3-month-old group. No cases of posterior fontanelle non-fusion were identified in the NZ European population.

"Examining development processes for text messaging interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease: systematic literature review",2019,"Background: Interventions delivered by mobile phones have the potential to prevent cardiovascular disease (CVD) by supporting behavior change toward healthier lifestyles and treatment adherence. To allow replication and adaptation of these interventions across settings, it is important to fully understand how they have been developed. However, the development processes of these interventions have not previously been systematically examined. Objective: This study aimed to systematically describe and compare the development process of text messaging interventions identified in the Text2PreventCVD systematic review. Methods: We extracted data about the development process of the 9 interventions identified in the Text2PreventCVD systematic review. Data extraction, which was guided by frameworks for the development of complex interventions, considered the following development stages: intervention planning, design, development, and pretesting. Following data extraction, we invited the developers of the interventions to contribute to our study by reviewing the accuracy of the extracted data and providing additional data not reported in the available publications. Results: A comprehensive description of the development process was available for 5 interventions. Multiple methodologies were used for the development of each intervention. Intervention planning involved gathering information from stakeholder consultations, literature reviews, examination of relevant theory, and preliminary qualitative research. Intervention design involved the use of behavior change theories and behavior change techniques. Intervention development involved (1) generating message content based on clinical guidelines and expert opinions; (2) conducting literature reviews and primary qualitative research to inform decisions about message frequency, timing, and level of tailoring; and (3) gathering end-user feedback concerning message readability, intervention acceptability, and perceived utility. Intervention pretesting involved pilot studies with samples of 10 to 30 participants receiving messages for a period ranging from 1 to 4 weeks. Conclusions: The development process of the text messaging interventions examined was complex and comprehensive, involving multiple studies to guide decisions about the scope, content, and structure of the interventions. Additional research is needed to establish whether effective messaging systems can be adapted from work already done or whether this level of development is needed for application in other conditions and settings. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

"Productive but not constructive: The work of shame in the affective governance of fat Pregnancy",2019,"The productivity of shame as an affective-discursive practice implicated in the neoliberal governance of “healthy pregnancy” is examined in the narratives of 27 ethnically diverse, cis-gendered, self-identified fat pregnant people in Aotearoa New Zealand. Shame is identified as a dominant affective-discursive practice produced in response to the problematising medical discourses surrounding the fat pregnant body, leading to the constitution of shamed maternal subjectivities. Seeking reparation in order to restore their maternal identities, participants adopted a range of self-governance strategies. However, fat shaming, while productive in constituting self-governed maternal subjects, was not constructive. We demonstrate how shame induced self-governed action, rather than improving maternal and infant health, instead led to a range of unhealthful behaviours and negatively impacted how participants experienced their pregnancies, emerging maternal selves, and newly born children. We call for attention to affect in feminist governmentality studies of reproduction and fatness. ?

Design: Experiential qualitative research involving face-to-face, semistructured individual interviews. Participants: Fifteen M?ori (low SEP = 7; high SEP = 8) and 16 non-M?ori (low SEP = 7; high SEP = 9) mothers of preschoolers. Measurements: Interviews were guided by questions about how preschoolers slept and what mothers thought made a difference to their child's sleep. Data were analyzed inductively using thematic analysis. Results: Four themes were identified: “health, activity, and diet”; “sleep-promoting physical environments”; “consistency”; and “doing it our way.” Children being healthy and active, sleep-conducive bedroom spaces, consistent routines, and supportive social environments assisted preschoolers to sleep well. However, broader contextual factors beyond mothers' control influenced the degree of autonomy they had over implementing sleep-supporting strategies that worked for their families. External influences included access to financial resources; parental work patterns; early childhood education service practices; access to quality housing; and affordable, culturally responsive, and respectful professional sleep advice. Conclusion: Efforts aimed at facilitating healthy sleep among preschoolers and effective preschooler sleep interventions must go beyond simply recommending individual-focused sleep-promoting tips to include actions on the social determinants of sleep and the sociopolitical drivers that influence these. ? 2019 National Sleep Foundation.","article; child; childhood; clinical article; diet; driver; education; female; housing; human; human experiment; infant; interview; mother; New Zealand; nonREM sleep; qualitative research; respect; social determinants of health; social environment; thematic analysis; adult; male; middle aged; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; preschool child; psychology; sleep; socioeconomics; young adult; Adult; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mothers; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Qualitative Research; Sleep; Social Determinants of Health; Socioeconomic Factors; Young Adult"
"The addition of fluoxetine to cognitive behavioural therapy for youth depression (YoDA-C): a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical trial",2019,"Background: Medication is commonly used to treat youth depression, but whether medication should be added to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) as first-line treatment is unclear. We aimed to examine whether combined treatment with CBT and fluoxetine was more effective than CBT and placebo in youth with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder. Methods: The Youth Depression Alleviation–Combined Treatment (YoDA-C) trial was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre clinical trial. Participants were aged 15–25 years with moderate-to-severe MDD and had sought care at one of four clinical centres in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive CBT for 12 weeks, plus either fluoxetine or placebo. Participants began on one 20 mg capsule of fluoxetine or one placebo pill per day. All participants received CBT, delivered by therapists in weekly 50-minute sessions and attended interviews at baseline, and at weeks 4, 8, and 12, during which they completed assessments with research assistants. Participants saw a psychiatrist or psychiatry trainee to complete medical assessments at the same timepoints. The primary outcome was change in the interviewer-rated Montgomery-?sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 12 weeks. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612001281886). Findings: 153 participants (mean age 19·6 years [SD 2·7]) were enrolled from Feb 20, 2013, to Dec 13, 2016. 77 (50%) patients were allocated to CBT and placebo and 76 (50%) to CBT and fluoxetine. Participants had severe depression at baseline (mean MADRS score 33·6 [SD 5·1] in the CBT and placebo group and 32·2 [5·6] in the CBT and fluoxetine group), with high proportions of participants with anxiety disorder comorbidity (47 [61%] in the CBT and placebo group and 49 [64%] in the CBT and fluoxetine group) and past-month suicidal ideation (55 [71%] in the CBT and placebo group and 59 [78%] in the CBT and fluoxetine group). 59 (77%) participants in the CBT and placebo group and 64 (84%) in the CBT and fluoxetine group completed follow-up at week 12. After 12 weeks of treatment both groups showed a reduction in MADRS scores (?13·7, 95% CI ?16·0 to ?11·4, in the CBT and placebo group and ?15·1, ?17·4 to ?12·9, in the CBT and fluoxetine group). There was no significant between-group difference in MADRS scores (?1·4, ?4·7 to 1·8; p=0·39). There were five suicide attempts in the CBT and placebo group and one suicide attempt in the CBT and fluoxetine group (odds ratio 0·2, 0·0–1·8; p=0·21), and no significant between-group differences for other suicidal behaviours. Interpretation: We did not find evidence that the addition of fluoxetine (rather than placebo) to CBT further reduced depressive symptoms in young people with moderate-to-severe MDD. Exploratory analyses showed that the addition of medication might be helpful for patients with comorbid anxiety symptoms and for older youth.

"Situating biologies of traditional Chinese medicine in Central Europe",2019,"Since the concept of ‘local biologies’ was proposed in the 1990s, it has been used to examine biosocial processes that transform human bodies in similar and different ways around the globe. This paper explores understandings of biosocial differentiation and convergence in the case of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) in the Czech Republic. Specifically, it examines how Czech TCM practitioners view TCM as universally applicable while fine-tuning it to situated biosocial conditions, experimenting with the compatibilities of various human and plant bodies as part of their generalised, clinical practice. Drawing upon ethnographic research among TCM practitioners in the Czech Republic, it suggests that in addition to the individualization of TCM therapeutics to suit particular patients, Czech TCM is characterised by collective particularization, shaped by local concerns over ethnic, environmental and cultural differences. By looking critically at TCM practitioners’ sensitivities to localised biological similarities and differences it aims to contribute to understandings of the expansion of TCM in Central Europe, as well as more broadly to current social science debates over the risks and opportunities inherent in abandoning the assumption of a universal human body and biology. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""

"Mental health of urban residents in the developed cities of the Yangtze River Delta in China: Measurement with the mental composite scale from the WHOQOL-BREF",2019,"This paper aims to explore the reliability, validity and influence of demographics on mental health measured by the mental composite scale from the World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) among Chinese urban residents. Participants were 971 young and middle-aged urban residents in six developed cities of Yangtze River Delta. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the potential factor structure of the mental composite scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to evaluate the goodness of fit of the factor structure model. And logistic regression model was conducted to analyze the demographic effect. The results showed that the mental composite scale had a satisfactory reliability and validity, and the three-factor structure model had an acceptable goodness of fit. Furthermore, it indicated that annual income was the significant indicator of mental health. Participants who had earned between RMB50,000 - RMB100,000 annually were more likely to report better mental health than those with annual income less than RMB10,000. It demonstrated therefore that the mental composite scale selected from the WHOQOL-BREF was an appropriate instrument to measure the mental health of Chinese urban residents in the Yangtze River Delta region. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Persistent avascular retina in infants with a history of type 2 retinopathy of prematurity: To treat or not to treat?",2019,"Purpose: To investigate persistent avascular retina in infants with type 2 retinopathy of permaturity (ROP) that persisted after 45 weeks' post-menstrual age when regular ROP screening ceased. Methods: A prospective observational study where fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) was completed on consecutive infants who had a history of type 2 ROP and avascular retina during ROP screening that persisted after 45 weeks' post-menstrual age. Results: FFA was completed on 72 eyes of 36 infants (53% male), with a mean gestational age of 26.0 ± 2.2 weeks and a mean birth weight of 834.6 ± 216.3 grams. The mean age at discharge from ROP screening was 47.6 weeks' post-menstrual age. All patients had type 2 ROP at the worst stage of their disease, with predominantly stage 2 disease. FFA was performed at a mean age of 18.8 ± 10.3 months post-menstrual age. All patients had detectable avascular retina in peripheral zone II or III on FFA. Peripheral vessel leakage was present in 3 eyes of 2 infants (5.5%), who both subsequently received peripheral laser treatment. Conclusions: Premature infants with type 2 ROP may have persistent peripheral avascular retina with unknown long-term ocular complications, which can present management dilemmas. Retinal FFA is recommended to determine retinal ischemia and aid decision making for treatment in these cases. Copyright ?

"End of life care for long-term care residents with dementia, chronic illness and cancer: Prospective staff survey",2019,"Background: Little is known about the quality of end of life care in long-term care (LTC) for residents with different diagnostic trajectories. The aim of this study was to compare symptoms before death in LTC for those with cancer, dementia or chronic illness. Methods: After-death prospective staff survey of resident deaths with random cluster sampling in 61 representative LTC facilities across New Zealand (3709 beds). Deaths (n = 286) were studied over 3 months in each facility. Standardised questionnaires - Symptom Management (SM-EOLD) and Comfort Assessment in End of life with Dementia (CAD-EOLD) - were administered to staff after the resident's death. Results: Primary diagnoses at the time of death were dementia (49%), chronic illness (30%), cancer (17%), and dementia and cancer (4%). Residents with cancer had more community hospice involvement (30%) than those with chronic illness (12%) or dementia (5%). There was no difference in mean SM-EOLD in the last month of life by diagnosis (cancer 26.9 (8.6), dementia 26.5(8.2), chronic illness 26.9(8.6). Planned contrast analyses of individual items found people with dementia had more pain and those with cancer had less anxiety. There was no difference in mean CAD-EOLD scores in the week before death by diagnosis (total sample 33.7(SD 5.2), dementia 34.4(SD 5.2), chronic illness 33.0(SD 5.1), cancer 33.3(5.1)). Planned contrast analyses showed significantly more physical symptoms for those with dementia and chronic illness in the last month of life than those with cancer. Conclusions: Overall, symptoms in the last week and month of life did not vary by diagnosis. However, sub-group planned contrast analyses found those with dementia and chronic illness experienced more physical distress during the last weeks and months of life than those with cancer. These results highlight the complex nature of LTC end of life care that requires an integrated gerontology/palliative care approach. ? 2019 The Author(s).",""

"Alterations in muscle activation patterns during robot-assisted bilateral training: A pilot study",2019,"Robot-assisted bilateral training is being developed as a new rehabilitation approach for stroke patients. However, there is still a lack of understanding of muscle functions when performing robot-assisted synchronous movements. The aim of this work is to explore the muscle activation patterns and the voluntary effort of participants during different robot-assisted bilateral training protocols. To this end, 10 healthy participants were recruited to take part in a 60-minute experiment. The experiment included two different bilateral exercises, and each exercise contained four different training protocols. Trajectories of the robots, interaction force and surface electromyogram signals were recorded during training. The results show that the robots do affect the muscle activation patterns during different training protocols and exercises rather than the controller. Specifically, the activity of muscles is reduced in robot-assisted training but is increased in active force involved robot-assisted training when compared to robot-unassisted training. Meanwhile, the voluntary effort of participants can be presented by the adjusted trajectories via the controller. In addition, the results also suggest that the activations for the same muscle groups in the left and right arms are highly correlated with each other in both exercises. Furthermore, the training protocols and methods developed in this work could be further extended in future clinical trials to investigate therapeutic outcomes for patients as well as to better understand bilateral recovery processes. ?

"Improving low fruit and vegetable intake in children: Findings from a system dynamics, community group model building study",2019,"Many children globally do not meet government guidelines for daily fruit and vegetable intake, and in New Zealand, adherence to the vegetable intake recommendation is declining. This study aimed to identify systemic barriers to children meeting fruit and vegetable (FV) guidelines and generate sustainable actions within a local community to improve children’s FV intake. A qualitative system dynamics method of community group model building was used. The research team partnered with Healthy Families Wait?kere, a Ministry of Health funded prevention initiative, to recruit 17 participants (including students, parents, teachers, community leaders, local retailers and health promoters) from a low-income, ethnically-diverse community in West Auckland, New Zealand. Three group model building workshops were held during which a systems map was created and used to identify actions by considering causal pathways and reinforcing loops in the system. Barriers to children’s FV intake identified by participants were the saturation of fast-food outlets in the community and ubiquitous marketing of these products, the high cost of fresh produce compared to fast food, and parents having little time for food preparation plus declining cooking skills and knowledge. Several actions to improve children’s FV intake by improving the local food environment were identified, which will be co-designed further and tested by a collaborative group involving community leaders. This project highlights the effectiveness of group model building for engaging a local community in systems change to improve child nutrition, and supplies a blueprint for future qualitative system dynamics research. ? 2019 Gerritsen et al.

"Preclinical models of altered early life nutrition and development of reproductive disorders in female offspring",2019,"Early epidemiology studies in humans have and continue to offer valuable insight into the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) hypothesis, which emphasises the importance of early-life nutritional and environmental changes on the increased risk of metabolic and reproductive disease in later life. Human studies are limited and constrained by a range of factors which do not apply to preclinical research. Animal models therefore offer a unique opportunity to fully investigate the mechanisms associated with developmental programming, helping to elucidate the developmental processes which influence reproductive diseases, and highlight potential biomarkers which can be translated back to the human condition. This review covers the use and limitations of a number of animal models frequently utilised in developmental programming investigations, with an emphasis on dietary manipulations which can lead to reproductive dysfunction in offspring. ?

"MicroRNAs as molecular targets of quercetin and its derivatives underlying their biological effects: A preclinical strategy",2019,"Quercetin is a well-known flavonoid naturally occurring in most of the plant foods and is often found in the human diet. It can act as a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent, and plays significant roles in the prevention of various chronic diseases. Recent findings revealed that quercetin could affect metabolic traits by regulating certain transcription factors or key proteins involved in cellular signal pathways and influencing the expression of functional genes along with related regulatory pathway(s), and that microRNAs (miRNAs) circulate in body fluids and are involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing and regulation of gene expression in various biological processes including development, proliferation, metabolism and inflammation. This article reviews the studies into the molecular pathways underlying the beneficial bioactivities of quercetin and its derivatives, and the modulatory effects of miRNAs by quercetin and its derivatives on miRNAs-mediated cellular processes. MicroRNAs as molecular targets of quercetin and its derivatives and as predictive biomarkers for early diagnosis of the outcome of quercetin-rich diets are highlighted. Current limitations and future directions of research on the impact and associated mechanism(s) of the synergies between quercetin species and other co-existing nutrients/bioactives on the expression of miRNAs as well as the roles of miRNAs in overall nutritional control are critically discussed. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Diagnosis; Gene expression regulation; Metabolism; Nutrition; Phenols; RNA; Transcription; Intercellular signalling; MicroRNAs; multi-targeted; quercetin; synergism; Flavonoids; antioxidant; microRNA; quercetin; Antioxidants; MicroRNAs; Quercetin"
"Exploring University Food Environment and On-Campus Food Purchasing Behaviors, Preferences, and Opinions",2019,"Objective: Cross-sectional observation of a university food environment and a survey of food purchasing preferences, behaviors, and opinions of students and staff to formulate strategies for interventions. Design: A modified food environment-quality index was used to assess food outlets. A cross-sectional survey with closed (n = 42) and open-ended (n = 2) questions assessing students and staff purchasing, choice determinants, and opinions about the food environment. Setting: Six campuses of 1 large urban university. Participants: Food outlets (eg, convenience stores, restaurant and caf?, takeout, vending machines) (n = 57). University students and staff (n = 1,954). Analysis: The researchers calculated descriptive statistics and Pearson chi-square tests to compare the percentages of healthy and/or unhealthy products in high- vs low-scoring outlets. Kruskal–Wallis H test was used to determine differences in healthiness between outlet types. Pearson chi-square tests were used to examine the influence of gender, and student and staff differences in survey responses. Results: Median food environment-quality index was 79 out of 199 (interquartile range = 7). Six food outlets were categorized as healthy and 2 as unhealthy; the rest were intermediate. Overall, healthy items were less available, accessible, and promoted and cost more than unhealthy items. The majority of respondents in the survey (79%) purchased food and beverages on campus; males consuming them more frequently than did females (P =.001) and students consumed them more frequently than did staff (P =.001). Value for money, healthfulness, and taste determined the choice. Respondents suggested increasing value for money and healthy options. Conclusions and Implications: Interventions that improve food availability, accessibility, prices, and promotions through policies are warranted and would be well-received among both university students and staff. ? 2019 Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior","adult; article; chi square test; controlled study; female; food availability; gender; human; human experiment; machine; major clinical study; male; money; purchasing; rest; restaurant; scientist; staff; statistics; university student; young adult"
"A systematic review of psychological interventions for patients with head and neck cancer",2019,"Aim: The purpose of this systematic review is to identify psychological interventions that have been effective at improving quality of life and reducing psychological distress (depression and anxiety) in patients with head and neck cancer. Methods: All relevant peer-reviewed articles published between March 1980 and March 2017 were identified through an electronic search of five databases: Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Academic Search Complete. Risk of bias was independently assessed by two reviewers using the Crowe Critical Appraisal Tool (CCAT). Following this, a narrative synthesis of the findings was completed. Results: Twenty-one unique intervention studies were identified. Interventions tested included cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), psychoeducation, meditation/mindfulness, group therapy, and telehealth initiatives. Ten studies utilised a randomised controlled design. Five of these investigated CBT and three examined psychoeducation, with the greatest empirical support found for these intervention types. However, the majority of studies were underpowered to detect significant effects and did not examine whether improvements in quality of life and psychological well-being were sustained over time. Conclusions: Further research is needed to investigate the effects of psychological interventions among patients with head and neck cancer, using randomised controlled designs, adequately powered samples, and long-term follow-up. This would allow evidence-based recommendations to be made regarding the most appropriate interventions to implement in clinical practice.

"Relationship Between Total Body Protein and Cross-Sectional Skeletal Muscle Area in Liver Cirrhosis Is Influenced by Overhydration",2019,"Sarcopenia as defined by reduced skeletal muscle area (SMA) on cross-sectional abdominal imaging has been proposed as an objective measure of malnutrition, and it is associated with both wait-list mortality and posttransplant complications in patients with cirrhosis. SMA, however, has never been validated against the gold standard measurement of total body protein (TBP) by in vivo neutron activation analysis (IVNAA). Furthermore, overhydration is common in cirrhosis, and its effect on muscle area measurement remains unknown. We aimed to examine the relationship between SMA and TBP in patients with cirrhosis and to assess the impact of overhydration on this relationship. Patients with cirrhosis who had undergone IVNAA and cross-sectional imaging within 30 days were retrospectively identified. Patients with significant clinical events between measurements were excluded. Psoas muscle area (PMA) and SMA at the level of the third lumbar vertebrae were determined. Total body water was estimated from a multicompartment model and expressed as a fraction of fat-free mass (FFM), as determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, to provide an index of hydration status. In total, 107 patients underwent 109 cross-sectional imaging studies (87 computed tomography; 22 magnetic resonance imaging) within 30 days of IVNAA. Median time between measurements was 1 day (IQR, –1 to 3 days). Between 43% and 69% of the cohort was identified as sarcopenic, depending on muscle area cutoff values used. TBP was strongly correlated with SMA (r?=?0.78; P?<?0.001) and weakly correlated with PMA (r?=?0.49; P?<?0.001). Multiple linear regression showed SMA was significantly and positively associated with FFM hydration (P?<?0.001) independently of TBP. In conclusion, SMA is more closely related to TBP than is PMA, and it should be preferred as a measure of sarcopenia. Overhydration significantly affects the measurement of cross-sectional muscle area.

"Evaluation of vision screening of 5–15-year-old children in three Tongan schools: comparison of The Auckland Optotypes and Lea symbols",2019,"Background: Comprehensive vision screening programmes for children are an important part of public health strategy, but do not exist in many countries, including Tonga. This project set out to assess: (1) the functional vision of children attending primary schools in Tonga and (2) how a new recognition acuity test (The Auckland Optotypes displayed on a tablet computer) compares to use of a standardised eye chart in this setting. Methods: Children from three Tongan primary schools were invited to participate. Acuity testing was conducted using a standardised recognition acuity chart (Lea symbols) and the tablet test displaying two formats of The Auckland Optotypes. Measures of ocular alignment, stereo acuity and non-cycloplegic photorefraction were also taken. Results: Parents of 249 children consented to participate. One child was untestable. Only 2.8 per cent of testable children achieved visual acuity worse than 0.3 logMAR in the weaker eye. Results from the Spot Photoscreener suggested that no children had myopia or hyperopia, but that some children had astigmatism. The tablet test was practical in a community setting, and showed ±0.2 logMAR limits of agreement with the Lea symbols chart. Conclusion: The sample of children in Tongan primary schools had good functional vision. A modified version of the tablet acuity test is a promising option for vision screening in this context. ? 2019 Optometry Australia",""
"Causes of childhood low vision and blindness in New Zealand",2019,"Importance: This is the first national study on childhood visual impairment in a developed nation, New Zealand, describing prevalence, aetiology and preventable causes of low vision and blindness in children. Background: Causes of childhood blindness vary between regions. This study aimed to present region-specific data on epidemiology of childhood blindness affecting a developed nation, New Zealand. Design: Retrospective data analysis. Participants: All children enrolled with the Blind and Low Vision Education Network New Zealand (BLENNZ) with best-corrected visual acuity ?6/18, or binocular visual field <10°. Methods: 1000 out of 1321 children with visual impairment enrolled with BLENNZ were included. The principal cause of visual loss was determined, and the severity of visual loss categorized as low vision, or blindness according to the World Health Organization criteria. Main Outcome Measures: Main outcome measures were degree of visual impairment, aetiology of visual impairment and treatment modalities for visual rehabilitation. Results: The calculated prevalence of childhood blindness and low vision was 0.05% and 0.06%. Principle causes of blindness were cortical visual impairment (31.5%), optic nerve atrophy (16.5%) and optic nerve hypoplasia (9.0%). The main preventable causes of blindness were neonatal trauma/asphyxia (31.5%), retinopathy of prematurity (18.2%) and non-accidental injury (10.3%). Conclusions and Relevance: This is the first national report on prevalence of childhood low vision and blindness in New Zealand. The prevalence and leading causes of low vision and blindness found in this study were comparable to other developed nations; however, preventable causes of low vision and blindness appeared unique to New Zealand. ? 2018 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists","adolescent; adult; Article; best corrected visual acuity; binocular vision; blindness; child; controlled study; disease severity; eye injury; female; geographic distribution; human; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; newborn hypoxia; optic nerve atrophy; optic nerve hypoplasia; outcome assessment; population research; prevalence; rehabilitation care; retrolental fibroplasia; retrospective study; visual impairment"
"Determinants of Persistence and Change in Early Childhood Behavioural Problems: The Roles of Parenting and Maternal Mental Health",2019,"Objectives: The current study aimed to investigate factors associated with the persistence and change in behavioural difficulties during early childhood. Methods: The study used data from the Growing Up in New Zealand birth cohort. Maternal-rated behavioural difficulties were assessed when children were aged 2 and 4.5 years (N = 5885). The ninetieth percentile of the Strengths and Difficulties total difficulties score was used to identify children who showed serious behavioural difficulties at each time point, with children then categorised as showing no difficulties, improved behaviour, later difficulties, and persistent difficulties. Predictors of interest related to maternal-reported mental health and parenting behaviour, family social support and exposure to physical and verbal inter-parental conflict. Results: Poor maternal mental health at multiple time points and authoritarian and physical punishment parenting styles were associated with an increased likelihood of developing behavioural difficulties at 4.5 years and showing persistent difficulties from 2 to 4.5 years. Physical punishment and authoritarian parenting styles also mediated the association between a history of verbal inter-parental conflict and both developing later difficulties and persistent difficulties, whereas only physical punishment parenting style mediated this association for a history of physical inter-parental conflict. The only factor that distinguished children who improved from children who persisted was maternal parenting self-evaluation at 9 months; mothers who had a better self-evaluation were more likely to have children who persisted than improved. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the importance of addressing mothers’ self-reported management of their children’s behavioural difficulties, inter-parental conflict and maternal emotional wellbeing. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"The use of wearable cameras in assessing children's dietary intake and behaviours in China",2019,"The use of lifelogging device in dietary assessments can reduce misreporting and underreporting, which are common in the previous studies conventional methods. We performed the first study in Chinese children (primary school Grade 4) that applied the wearable cameras in assisting dietary recall. Children (n = 52) wore the wearable cameras (Narrative Clip 2) for seven consecutive days, during which they completed a 3-day 24-h dietary recall at home. Then children modified their dietary recalls at school by reviewing the photos taken by the wearable camera at school, with the assistance of the investigator, and generated the camera-assisted 24-h dietary recalls. Compared with camera-assisted dietary recalls, 8% (n = 160) and 1% (n = 11) of food items were underreported (i.e. not reported at all) and misreported (i.e. reported in an incorrect amount) by dietary recalls without camera-assistance, respectively. Dietary recalls without camera assistance underestimated daily energy intake by 149 ± 182 kcal/d (8%) in comparison to the camera-assisted dietary recalls. Foods consumed on the snacking occasions (40%) were more likely to be underreported than those consumed at main meals (P < 0.001). Beverages (37%), fruits (30%), snacks and desserts (16%) were foods most likely to be inaccurately reported. Children were satisfied with the wearable cameras, with a median score 5.0 (IQR: 5.0–5.0) for most features. Wearable cameras hold promise for improving accuracy of dietary intake assessment in children, providing rich objective information on dietary behaviours, and received high level of satisfaction and compliance of the users. Our results suggest that the accuracy of dietary recall among Chinse school-aged children could be improved by wearable camera, especially avoiding underreporting in the snacking occasions. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","ascorbic acid; calcium; iron; magnesium; potassium; retinol; riboflavin; sodium; thiamine; zinc; Article; beverage; calcium intake; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; child; child behavior; child nutrition; China; comfort; controlled study; dietary fiber; dietary intake; fast food; fat intake; female; human; iron intake; magnesium intake; major clinical study; male; meal; nutritional assessment; primary school; protein intake; school child; sodium intake; vitamin intake"
"Comparative Safety and Pharmacokinetic Evaluation of Three Oral Selenium Compounds in Cancer Patients",2019,"Selenium (Se) compounds have demonstrated anticancer properties in both preclinical and clinical studies, with particular promise in combination therapy where the optimal form and dose of selenium has yet to be established. In a phase I randomised double-blinded study, the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of sodium selenite (SS), Se-methylselenocysteine (MSC) and seleno-l-methionine (SLM) were compared in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and a cohort of patients with solid malignancies. Twenty-four patients received 400?μg of elemental Se as either SS, MSC or SLM for 8?weeks. None of the Se compounds were associated with any significant toxicities, and the total plasma Se AUC of SLM was markedly raised in comparison to MSC and SS. DNA damage assessment revealed negligible genotoxicity, and some minor reductions in lymphocyte counts were observed. At the dose level used, all three Se compounds are well-tolerated and non-genotoxic. Further analyses of the pharmacodynamic effects of Se on healthy and malignant peripheral blood mononuclear cells will inform the future evaluation of higher doses of these Se compounds.

"Prognostic models for breast cancer: A systematic review",2019,"Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women worldwide, with a great diversity in outcomes among individual patients. The ability to accurately predict a breast cancer outcome is important to patients, physicians, researchers, and policy makers. Many models have been developed and tested in different settings. We systematically reviewed the prognostic models developed and/or validated for patients with breast cancer. Methods: We conducted a systematic search in four electronic databases and some oncology websites, and a manual search in the bibliographies of the included studies. We identified original studies that were published prior to 1st January 2017, and presented the development and/or validation of models based mainly on clinico-pathological factors to predict mortality and/or recurrence in female breast cancer patients. Results: From the 96 articles selected from 4095 citations found, we identified 58 models, which predicted mortality (n = 28), recurrence (n = 23), or both (n = 7). The most frequently used predictors were nodal status (n = 49), tumour size (n = 42), tumour grade (n = 29), age at diagnosis (n = 24), and oestrogen receptor status (n = 21). Models were developed in Europe (n = 25), Asia (n = 13), North America (n = 12), and Australia (n = 1) between 1982 and 2016. Models were validated in the development cohorts (n = 43) and/or independent populations (n = 17), by comparing the predicted outcomes with the observed outcomes (n = 55) and/or with the outcomes estimated by other models (n = 32), or the outcomes estimated by individual prognostic factors (n = 8). The most commonly used methods were: Cox proportional hazards regression for model development (n = 32); the absolute differences between the predicted and observed outcomes (n = 30) for calibration; and C-index/AUC (n = 44) for discrimination. Overall, the models performed well in the development cohorts but less accurately in some independent populations, particularly in patients with high risk and young and elderly patients. An exception is the Nottingham Prognostic Index, which retains its predicting ability in most independent populations. Conclusions: Many prognostic models have been developed for breast cancer, but only a few have been validated widely in different settings. Importantly, their performance was suboptimal in independent populations, particularly in patients with high risk and in young and elderly patients. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Australia; breast cancer; cancer grading; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; clinical outcome; Europe; high risk patient; human; mortality rate; North America; Nottingham Prognostic Indicator; population research; publication; Review; systematic review; tumor volume; validation study; Asia; breast tumor; female; metabolism; onset age; pathology; prognosis; proportional hazards model; theoretical model; estrogen receptor; Age of Onset; Asia; Australia; Breast Neoplasms; Europe; Female; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Neoplasm Grading; North America; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Receptors, Estrogen; Tumor Burden"
"Assessment of direct and indirect associations between children active school travel and environmental, household and child factors using structural equation modelling",2019,"Background: Active school travel (AST) is influenced by multiple factors including built and social environments, households and individual variables. A holistic theory such as Mitra’s Behavioural Model of School Transportation (BMST) is vital to comprehensively understand these complex interrelationships. This study aimed to assess direct and indirect associations between children’s AST and environmental, household and child factors based on the BMST using structural equation modelling (SEM). Methods: Data were drawn from Neighbourhoods for Active Kids (NfAK), a cross-sectional study of 1102 children aged 8-13 years (school years 5-8) and their parents from nine intermediate and 10 primary schools in Auckland, New Zealand between February 2015 and December 2016. Data were collected using an online participatory mapping survey (softGIS) with children, a computer-assisted telephone interviewing survey (CATI) with parents, and ArcGIS for built environment attributes. Based on the BMST a conceptual model of children’s school travel behaviour was specified for SEM analyses (‘hypothesised SEM’), and model modification was made to improve the model (‘modified SEM’). SEM analyses using Mplus were performed to test the hypothesised/modified SEM and to assess direct and indirect relationships among variables. Results: The overall fit of the modified SEM was acceptable (N = 542; Root mean square error of approximation = 0.04, Comparative fit index = 0.94, Tucker-Lewis index = 0.92). AST was positively associated with child independent mobility, child-perceived neighbourhood safety, and parent-perceived importance of social interaction and neighbourhood social environment. Distance to school, and parental perceptions of convenience and concerns about traffic safety were negatively associated with AST. Parental fears of stranger danger were indirectly related to AST through those of traffic safety. Distance to school and child independent mobility mediated relationships between AST and child school year and sex. Conclusions: Increasing children’s AST requires action on multiple fronts including communities that support independent mobility by providing child friendly social and built environments, safety from traffic, and policies that promote local schools and safe vehicle-free zones around school. ? 2019 The Author(s).","active school travel; adolescent; analytical error; Article; biosafety; child; child behavior; child care; computer analysis; conceptual framework; controlled study; cross-sectional study; fear; female; health survey; household; human; male; neighborhood; New Zealand; online system; parental attitude; primary school; school child; social environment; social interaction; structural equation modeling; telephone interview; traffic; travel; child parent relation; family size; geographic information system; latent class analysis; school; student; Adolescent; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Characteristics; Geographic Information Systems; Humans; Latent Class Analysis; New Zealand; Parents; Schools; Social Environment; Students; Travel"

"The impact of health on professional diver attrition",2019,"Introduction: Approximately 77% of professional divers leave the industry within five years of entry for reasons that are uncertain. One possibility is that attrition is due to ill-health. The health of New Zealand occupational divers is surveyed by a comprehensive medical examination every five years and by a health questionnaire in the intervening years. Divers are thereby confirmed ‘fit’ annually. The aim of this study was to determine if divers quit the industry due to a health problem not identified by this health surveillance system. Method: 601 divers who had left the industry within five years of entry medical examination (‘quitters’) were identified from a computerised database. One hundred and thirty-six who could be contacted were questioned about their principal reason for quitting. Comparison was made between the health data of all those defined as ‘quitters’ and a group of 436 ‘stayers’ who have remained active in the industry for over 10 years. Results: Health was the principal reason for abandoning a diving career for only 2.9% of quitters. The overwhelming majority (97.1%) quit because of dissatisfaction with aspects of the work, such as remuneration and reliability of employment. Besides gender, the only significant difference between the health data of quitters and stayers was that smoking was four times more prevalent among quitters. Conclusions: The key determinant of early attrition from the New Zealand professional diver workforce is industry-related rather than health-related. The current New Zealand diver health surveillance system detects the medical problems that cause divers to quit the industry. ? 2019, South Pacific Medicine Underwater Society and the European Underwater and Baromedical Society.

"Vitamin D and Otitis Media",2019,"Purpose of Review: To examine the relationship between vitamin D and otitis media. Recent Findings: Vitamin D deficiency has been associated with several respiratory diseases, including otitis media. Vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of otitis media. This relationship may be explained by vitamin D supporting the immune system by upregulating antimicrobial peptides which are effective against otopathogens and biofilm formation, supporting a less inflammatory immune response, or promoting beneficial commensal bacteria. Summary: This review will explore risk factors of both otitis media and vitamin D deficiency, the evidence of vitamin D being beneficial for various forms of otitis media, and possible mechanisms of action. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","25 hydroxyvitamin D; colecalciferol; placebo; vitamin D; vitamin D receptor; bacterium carrier; cytokine release; disease association; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; human; immune response; mucociliary clearance; nonhuman; otitis media; pathogenesis; Review; risk factor; secretory otitis media; treatment duration; vitamin blood level; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin supplementation"
"Gout, Hyperuricemia, and Crystal-Associated Disease Network Consensus Statement Regarding Labels and Definitions for Disease Elements in Gout",2019,"Objective: The language currently used to describe gout lacks standardization. The aim of this project was to develop a consensus statement on the labels and definitions used to describe the basic disease elements of gout. Methods: Experts in gout (n = 130) were invited to participate in a Delphi exercise and face-to-face consensus meeting to reach consensus on the labeling and definitions for the basic disease elements of gout. Disease elements and labels in current use were derived from a content analysis of the contemporary medical literature, and the results of this analysis were used for item selection in the Delphi exercise and face-to-face consensus meeting. Results: There were 51 respondents to the Delphi exercise and 30 attendees at the face-to-face meeting. Consensus agreement (?80%) was achieved for the labels of 8 disease elements through the Delphi exercise; the remaining 3 labels reached consensus agreement through the face-to-face consensus meeting. The agreed labels were monosodium urate crystals, urate, hyperuric(a)emia, tophus, subcutaneous tophus, gout flare, intercritical gout, chronic gouty arthritis, imaging evidence of monosodium urate crystal deposition, gouty bone erosion, and podagra. Participants at the face-to-face meeting achieved consensus agreement for the definitions of all 11 elements and a recommendation that the label “chronic gout” should not be used. Conclusion: Consensus agreement was achieved for the labels and definitions of 11 elements representing the fundamental components of gout etiology, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation. The Gout, Hyperuricemia, and Crystal-Associated Disease Network recommends the use of these labels when describing the basic disease elements of gout. ? 2018, American College of Rheumatology","urate; uric acid; Article; bone erosion; chronic disease; clinical feature; consensus; content analysis; controlled study; crystal; crystal arthropathy; Delphi study; disease exacerbation; gout; human; hyperuricemia; major clinical study; medical literature; medical terminology; methodology; nomenclature; pathophysiology; pseudogout; tophus; classification; crystal arthropathy; Delphi study; gout; hyperuricemia; Consensus; Crystal Arthropathies; Delphi Technique; Gout; Humans; Hyperuricemia; Uric Acid"

"Colonial histories, racism and health—The experience of M?ori and Indigenous peoples",2019,"The health of M?ori, the Indigenous peoples of Aotearoa, New Zealand, like that of almost all Indigenous peoples worldwide, is characterised by systematic inequities in health outcomes, differential exposure to the determinants of health, inequitable access to and through health and social systems, disproportionate marginalisation and inadequate representation in the health workforce. As health providers, we are often taught that ‘taking a history’ is a critical component of a patient consultation to ensure that the underlying conditions are treated rather than the often superficial presenting symptoms. In the same way, attempts to make sense of the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples is inadequate unless health providers engage critically with the history of their respective nations and any subsequent patterns of privilege or disadvantage. Understanding this history, within the framework of western imperialism and other similar colonial projects, allows us to make sense of international patterns of Indigenous health status. While health commentators acknowledge the unequal health outcomes of Indigenous people, and an increasing number also link these inequities to Indigenous marginalisation resulting from historic events, very few go further and expose the deep relationship between racism and coloniality and how these continue to be the basic determinants of Indigenous health today. This work includes honest examination of the role that science and the health disciplines have played historically in colonisation through the subjugation of Indigenous ways of knowing and knowledge production, as well as being complicit in the creation and maintenance of a fabricated hierarchy of humankind. Despite the ‘science’ of this racial hierarchy being discredited, it retains a false validity in our societies. As long as oppressive systems that continue to re-inscribe racism and white privilege remain in communities, including our academic communities, coloniality continues its discrimination. Indigenous voices on migration, ethnicity, racism and health will always demand the elimination of inequities in health but to do so will require a parallel commitment to critically interrogating all of our histories and our disciplines, as well as examining how our practice, including research, disrupts or maintains global systems of racism and coloniality. ? 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health","colonialism; health status; indigenous population; public health; racism; article; colonialism; controlled study; ethnicity; health status; human; indigenous people; organization; racism; validity; voice; health disparity; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; population group; New Zealand; Colonialism; Health Status Disparities; Humans; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Population Groups; Racism"
"Investigating strategies to improve clinical trial opportunities for patients with cancer in New Zealand-Insight",2019,"AIMS: Fewer than 5% of adult cancer patients participate in clinical trials, with multiple patient, clinician and institutional barriers identified. This study aimed to explore patient factors that impact access to cancer trials in New Zealand. METHODS: A questionnaire that included demographics and factors that might impact trial participation was circulated via nine district health boards (DHBs) and four cancer foundations to patients with a cancer diagnosis. RESULTS: Between July 2016 and August 2017, 691 patients responded, 62% female and 77% aged >50 years. Most patients (86%) would consider trial participation, which differed by income (p=0.0001) but not by age, tumour type or gender. Patients would consider attending another hospital (44%) or relocating (11%); 10% considered trials a last resort. Advantageous factors to participation included: benefiting others (92%), better treatment (82%), more scans and longer follow-up (47% and 51%). Disincentives included fear of randomisation (78%), treatment toxicities (71%), time and cost of more visits (40%) and unspecified future research (32%). CONCLUSION: Identified barriers to trial participation were similar in New Zealand to other developed countries. In this motivated cohort, patients are very interested in trial participation at any stage of their treatment and did not mind extra travel or tests. ?

"Nutritional Supplementation for the Prevention and/or Treatment of Gestational Diabetes Mellitus",2019,"Purpose of Review: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a common pregnancy complication that has short- and long-term health implications for both the mother and child. While lifestyle modifications, insulin therapy, and oral agents such as metformin are effective, they can be difficult to adhere to, and there remain concerns over long-term effects of oral agents on the infant. Further, GDM has no proven preventive strategies, which could be more effective than treatment postdiagnosis. Nutritional supplements are an appealing, potentially safer, and better tolerated alternative to pharmaceuticals to treat and/or prevent GDM. Here, we review the existing evidence for nutritional supplementation for treatment and prevention of GDM. Recent Findings: There is limited evidence that myo-inositol, vitamins D and B6, magnesium, selenium, zinc, fatty acids, and probiotics might be beneficial for the prevention or treatment of GDM. There are very few studies for each nutrient, and the existing studies tend to have few participants. Where multiple studies of a nutrient exist, often those studies were conducted within the same country, limiting the generalizability of the findings, or alternatively there was no consensus across findings. Summary: There is limited evidence that nutritional supplementation of myo-inositol, vitamins D and B6, magnesium, selenium, zinc, fatty acids, and probiotics could improve glycemic control or prevent GDM. Our understanding is constrained by the small number of studies, small sample sizes in most studies, and by lack of consistency across findings. Further large, high-quality, randomized controlled trials are required to determine the efficacy of nutritional supplements to treat or prevent GDM. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","endothelial nitric oxide synthase; fatty acid; folic acid; inositol; insulin receptor; iron; magnesium; probiotic agent; pyridoxine; selenium; trace element; vitamin D; zinc; body mass; caloric intake; clinical effectiveness; diet supplementation; dietary fiber; disease association; disease severity; gestational age; gestational weight gain; glycemic control; human; insulin signaling; nonhuman; obesity; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; protein intake; Review; risk factor; risk reduction; vitamin blood level"

"Endometrial resection and ablation techniques for heavy menstrual bleeding",2019,"Background: Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) is a significant health problem in premenopausal women; it can reduce their quality of life and can cause social disruption and physical problems such as iron deficiency anaemia. First-line treatment has traditionally consisted of medical therapy (hormonal and non-hormonal), but this is not always successful in reducing menstrual bleeding to acceptable levels. Hysterectomy is a definitive treatment, but it is more costly and carries some risk. Endometrial ablation may be an alternative to hysterectomy that preserves the uterus. Many techniques have been developed to 'ablate' (remove) the lining of the endometrium. First-generation techniques require visualisation of the uterus with a hysteroscope during the procedure; although it is safe, this procedure requires specific technical skills. Newer techniques for endometrial ablation (second- and third-generation techniques) have been developed that are quicker than previous approaches because they do not require hysteroscopic visualisation during the procedure. Objectives: To compare the efficacy, safety, and acceptability of endometrial destruction techniques to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) in premenopausal women. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Gynaecology and Fertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, and PsycInfo (from inception to May 2018). We also searched trials registers, other sources of unpublished or grey literature, and reference lists of retrieved studies, and we made contact with experts in the field and with pharmaceutical companies that manufacture ablation devices. Selection criteria: Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing different endometrial ablation or resection techniques for women reporting HMB without known uterine pathology, other than fibroids outside the uterine cavity and smaller than 3 centimetres, were eligible. Outcomes included improvement in HMB and in quality of life, patient satisfaction, operative outcomes, complications, and the need for further surgery, including hysterectomy. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, assessed trials for risk of bias, and extracted data. We contacted study authors for clarification of methods or for additional data. We assessed adverse events only if they were separately measured in the included trials. We undertook comparisons with individual techniques as well as an overall comparison of first- and second-generation ablation methods. Main results: We included in this update 28 studies (4287 women) with sample sizes ranging from 20 to 372. Most studies had low risk of bias for randomisation, attrition, and selective reporting. Less than half of these studies had adequate allocation concealment, and most were unblinded. Using GRADE, we determined that the quality of evidence ranged from moderate to very low. We downgraded evidence for risk of bias, imprecision, and inconsistency. Overall comparison of second-generation versus first-generation (i.e. gold standard hysteroscopic ablative) techniques revealed no evidence of differences in amenorrhoea at 1 year and 2 to 5 years' follow-up (risk ratio (RR) 0.99, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.78 to 1.27; 12 studies; 2145 women; I2 = 77%; and RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.72; 672 women; 4 studies; I2 = 80%; very low-quality evidence) and showed subjective improvement at 1 year follow-up based on a Pictorial Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC) (< 75 or acceptable improvement) (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.09; 5 studies; 1282 women; I2 = 0%; and RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.97 to 1.28; 236 women; 1 study; low-quality evidence). Study results showed no difference in patient satisfaction between second- and first-generation techniques at 1 year follow-up (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.04; 11 studies; 1750 women; I2 = 36%; low-quality evidence) nor at 2 to 5 years' follow-up (RR 1.02, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.13; 672 women; 4 studies; I2 = 81%). Compared with first-generation techniques, second-generation endometrial ablation techniques were associated with shorter operating times (mean difference (MD) -13.52 minutes, 95% CI -16.90 to -10.13; 9 studies; 1822 women; low-quality evidence) and more often were performed under local rather than general anaesthesia (RR 2.8, 95% CI 1.8 to 4.4; 6 studies; 1434 women; low-quality evidence). We are uncertain whether perforation rates differed between second- and first-generation techniques (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10 to 1.01; 1885 women; 8 studies; I2 = 0%). Trials reported little or no difference between second- and first-generation techniques in requirement for additional surgery (ablation or hysterectomy) at 1 year follow-up (RR 0.72, 95% CI 0.41 to 1.26; 6 studies: 935 women; low-quality evidence). At 5 years, results showed probably little or no difference between groups in the requirement for hysterectomy (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.59 to 1.22; 4 studies; 758 women; moderate-quality evidence). Authors' conclusions: Approaches to endometrial ablation have evolved from first-generation techniques to newer second- and third-generation approaches. Current evidence suggests that compared to first-generation techniques (endometrial laser ablation, transcervical resection of the endometrium, rollerball endometrial ablation), second-generation approaches (thermal balloon endometrial ablation, microwave endometrial ablation, hydrothermal ablation, bipolar radiofrequency endometrial ablation, endometrial cryotherapy) are of equivalent efficacy for heavy menstrual bleeding, with comparable rates of amenorrhoea and improvement on the PBAC. Second-generation techniques are associated with shorter operating times and are performed more often under local rather than general anaesthesia. It is uncertain whether perforation rates differed between second- and first-generation techniques. Evidence was insufficient to show which second-generation approaches were superior to others and to reveal the efficacy and safety of third-generation approaches versus first- and second-generation techniques. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.","clinical effectiveness; endometrium ablation; follow up; general anesthesia; human; hysterectomy; menorrhagia; meta analysis; operation duration; outcome assessment; patient satisfaction; premenopause; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk assessment; systematic review; therapy effect; uterus myoma; adult; catheter ablation; electrode; endometrium; female; low level laser therapy; menorrhagia; middle aged; postoperative complication; Adult; Catheter Ablation; Electrodes; Endometrium; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Laser Therapy; Menorrhagia; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Patient Satisfaction; Postoperative Complications; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic"
"Chronic cough and gastroesophageal reflux in children: Chest guideline and expert panel report",2019,"BACKGROUND: Whether gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or GER disease (GERD) causes chronic cough in children is controversial. Using the Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome (PICO) format, we undertook four systematic reviews. For children with chronic cough (> 4-weeks duration) and without underlying lung disease: (1) who do not have gastrointestinal GER symptoms, should empirical treatment for GERD be used? (2) with gastrointestinal GER symptoms, does treatment for GERD resolve the cough? (3) with or without gastrointestinal GER symptoms, what GER-based therapies should be used and for how long? (4) if GERD is suspected as the cause, what investigations and diagnostic criteria best determine GERD as the cause of the cough? METHODS: We used the CHEST Expert Cough Panel's protocol and American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodological guidelines and GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) framework. Delphi methodology was used to obtain consensus. RESULTS: Few randomized controlled trials addressed the first two questions and none addressed the other two. The single meta-analysis (two randomized controlled trials) showed no significant difference between the groups (any intervention for GERD vs placebo for cough resolution; OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.45-2.93; P ?.78). Proton pump inhibitors (vs placebo) caused increased serious adverse events. Qualitative data from existing CHEST cough systematic reviews were consistent with two international GERD guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: The panelists endorsed that: (1) treatment(s) for GERD should not be used when there are no clinical features of GERD; and (2) pediatric GERD guidelines should be used to guide treatment and investigations.

"The importance of both CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 germline variations in cyclophosphamide pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes",2019,"Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent used in the treatment of solid and haematological malignancies and as an immunosuppressive agent. As a prodrug, it is dependent on bioactivation to the active phosphoramide mustard metabolite to elicit its therapeutic effect. This focused review will highlight the evidence for the role of germline pharmacogenetic variation in both plasma pharmacokinetics and clinical outcomes. There is a substantial indication from 13 pharmacokinetic and 17 therapeutic outcome studies, in contexts as diverse as haematological malignancy, breast cancer, systemic lupus erythematosus and myeloablation, that pharmacogenetic variation in both CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 influence the bioactivation of cyclophosphamide. An additional role for pharmacogenetic variation in ALDH1A1 has also been reported. Future studies should comprehensively assess these 3 pharmacogenes and undertake appropriate statistical analysis of gene–gene interactions to confirm these findings and may allow personalised treatment regimens. ? 2019 The British Pharmacological Society","cyclophosphamide; cytochrome P450 2B6; cytochrome P450 2C19; breast cancer; clinical outcome; genetic variation; hematologic malignancy; human; pharmacogenetics; priority journal; Review; systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment outcome"
"Diabetic eye disease and screening attendance by ethnicity in New Zealand: A systematic review",2019,"To examine differences in incidence, prevalence and screening for diabetic retinopathy in New Zealand, we searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL up to 6 December 2018 for observational studies reporting diabetic eye disease or attendance at retinal screening, disaggregated by ethnicity. Two authors separately screened and selected studies, and extracted data. None of the 11 included studies reported data on visual impairment from diabetic retinopathy. All nine studies reporting diabetic eye disease by ethnicity found Pacific people and M?ori had higher rates of sight-threatening disease and lower rates of screening attendance compared to Europeans. Data for Asian people were infrequently reported, but when they were, they also fared worse than Europeans. This review highlights that equity-focused strategies are needed to address ethnic disparities in eye health among New Zealanders with diabetes. The review also identifies how research methods can be strengthened to enable future calculation of robust disease prevalence estimates. ? 2019 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists","Asian; clinical research; diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; ethnic difference; ethnicity; European; human; incidence; Maori (people); New Zealand; Pacific Islander; prevalence; Review; screening; systematic review; visual impairment"
"‘If someone donates $1000, they support you. If they donate $100 000, they have bought you’. Mixed methods study of tobacco, alcohol and gambling industry donations to Australian political parties",2019,"Background and Aims: Business corporations’ use of political donations to garner political influence is especially troubling in relation to products that damage human health. We sought to investigate patterns of donations to Australian political parties from tobacco, alcohol and gambling industry actors and the experiences of key informants. Design and Methods: We analysed public data on federal and state donations for 10 years to June 2015. We conducted 28 semi-structured interviews with current and former politicians, ex-political staffers and other key informants, concerning the role played by political donations of tobacco, alcohol and gambling companies in Australian politics. We examined temporal associations in donations data, and thematically analysed interviews. Results: Australian political parties declared donations of A$14 million (US$11 M) from tobacco ($1.9 M), alcohol ($7.7 M), gambling ($2.9 M) and supermarket ($1.7 M) entities, excluding donations below the $12 800 reporting threshold. Donations to the governing party increased substantially during debates about an alcohol tax and gambling law reform. Alcohol industry donations to major parties spiked ahead of elections. Interviewees identified the function of donations in terms of: (i) buying immediate influence; (ii) building long-term relationships; (iii) exploiting a flawed political system; and (iv) the need to look beyond donations, for example, to favour exchange; and the public's right to know about corporate influence on policy-makers. Discussion and Conclusions: The alcohol and gambling industries make substantial donations to influence particular decisions in the short term and build relationships over the long term. Banning corporate donations and publicly funding political parties warrant consideration to safeguard the integrity of public policy-making. ? 2018 Australasian Professional Society on Alcohol and other Drugs","attitude to health; Australia; commercial phenomena; economics; ethics; gambling; human; legislation and jurisprudence; lobbying; politics; prevention and control; psychology; public health; public policy; public relations; questionnaire; tobacco industry; Attitude to Health; Australia; Commerce; Gambling; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Lobbying; Politics; Public Health; Public Policy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tobacco Industry"

"Association between post-discharge secondary care and risk of repeated hospital presentation, entry into long-term care and mortality in older people after acute hospitalization",2019,"Aim: Hospitalizations are frequent among acutely ill older people, and might be reduced by post-discharge secondary care (PDSC). We aimed to determine the proportion of older patients planned to receive or attending PDSC after acute hospitalization and the association with undesirable outcomes. Methods: A retrospective observational study was carried out using an electronic health record system in two hospitals in New Zealand. Patients were aged ?75 years, initially presented at an emergency department (ED) and were discharged from medical, surgical, geriatrics or orthopedics wards in three 2-week periods. Planned PDSC at discharge, attended PDSC, ED presentation, long-term care (LTC) admission and death in 90 days after discharge were obtained through the health record system. Proportional hazards regression assessed the associations of planned or attended PDSC with undesirable outcomes (ED presentation, LTC admission and death) within 90 days of discharge. Results: Clinical records for 1085 patients were extracted, 963 were eligible. Of these, 413 (42.9%) had planned PDSC in discharge summaries, and 573 (59.5%) actually attended in 90 days. Patients planned for PDSC had a similarly adjusted hazard of ED presentation (HR 0.99, P = 0.92), LTC admission (HR 0.73, P = 0.25) and death (HR 0.80, P = 0.34) within 90 days of discharge, compared with those not planned. Similar non-significant associations were observed between attended PDSC and undesirable outcomes. Conclusions: In patients aged ?75 years in New Zealand, we did not find “planned PDSC” at discharge or “attended PDSC” after an acute hospitalization to be associated with ED presentation, LTC admission and death within 90 days after discharge. Other potential benefits of planned or attended PDSC require further investigation.

"Can you train the pelvic floor muscles by contracting other related muscles?",2019,"Aims: The aim of this study is to assess whether contraction of muscles other than the pelvic floor muscles (PFM) would be of sufficient magnitude to provide a “training” effect for the pelvic floor. Methods: Women were recruited via advertisement from a convenience sample of pelvic floor physiotherapists. A thin flexible array of pressure sensors (FemFit) was self-inserted into the vagina. Participants performed three maximum pelvic floor contractions and completed a randomized exercise protocol. Maximum pressures were determined for each sensor, for each exercise. Wilcoxon paired tests were used to ascertain the difference in pelvic floor muscle pressure between exercises, and between the pressures from the pelvic floor muscles sensors and those measuring abdominal pressure. Bonferroni correction α 0.005. Results: Data was obtained from nineteen participants. Mean age 43 ± 11 years, BMI 22.4 ± 3.2 kg m ?2 . Mean PFM pressure for pelvic floor muscle contractions was 16.3 ± 12.2 mmHg. Pressure in the region of the pelvic floor was significantly higher during a targeted contraction compared to that for all other exercises, except for cough and curl-ups (P = 0.009, P = 0.013 respectively). PFM pressure was significantly higher than abdominal for PFMC, internal rotators and gluteals (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Targeted PFM contractions develop higher pressures compared to abdominal pressure than any exercise tested in this study. The Femfit device was able to distinguish between abdominal and pelvic floor muscle pressures simultaneously. Exercising accessory muscles in an attempt to activate the pelvic floor sufficiently to illicit a training effect is not recommended. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","abdominal pressure; adult; Article; body mass; clinical protocol; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; exercise intensity; female; flexible array of pressure sensor; functional training; gluteus muscle; human; muscle contraction; musculoskeletal disease assessment; pelvis floor muscle; physiotherapist; randomized controlled trial; abdominal wall musculature; kinesiotherapy; middle aged; muscle contraction; pathophysiology; pelvis floor; physiology; pressure; procedures; urine incontinence; Abdominal Muscles; Adult; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Muscle Contraction; Pelvic Floor; Pressure; Urinary Incontinence"
"Vaccine-Preventable Disease-Associated Hospitalisations Among Migrant and Non-migrant Children in New Zealand",2019,"Migrants may experience a higher burden of vaccine-preventable disease (VPD)-associated hospitalisations compared to the host population. A retrospective cohort study from 2006 to 2015 was conducted that linked de-identified data from government sources using Statistic NZ’s Integrated Data Infrastructure. VPD-related hospitalisations were compared between three cohorts of children from birth to 5?years old: foreign-born children who migrated to NZ, children born in NZ of recent migrant mothers, and a comparator group of children born in NZ without a recent migration background. VPD-related hospitalisation rates were higher among NZ-born non-migrant children compared to NZ-born migrant and foreign-born children for all of the diseases of interest. For instance, 5.21% of NZ-born non-migrant children were hospitalised at least once due to all-cause gastroenteritis compared to 4.47% of NZ-born migrant children and only 1.13% of foreign-born migrant children. The overall hospitalisation rate for NZ-born non-migrant children was 3495 hospitalisations per 100,000 person years. Among children with migrant backgrounds, higher hospitalisation rates were noted among those of Pacific ethnicity and those with refugee backgrounds. Those arriving on Pacific visa schemes were hospitalised at rates ranging from 2644/100,000 person years among foreign-born migrant children and 4839/100,000 person years among NZ-born migrant children. Foreign-born quota refugee children and NZ-born children of quota refugee mothers were hospitalised at a rate of 4000–5000/100,000 person years. It is important to disaggregate migrant data to improve our understanding of migrant health. Children need to be age-appropriately vaccinated, and other individual and environmental factors addressed, to reduce the risk of infectious diseases. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Evolutionary and developmental mismatches are consequences of adaptive developmental plasticity in humans and have implications for later disease risk",2019,"A discrepancy between the phenotype of an individual and that which would confer optimal responses in terms of fitness in an environment is termed ‘mismatch’. Phenotype results from developmental plasticity, conditioned partly by evolutionary history of the species and partly by aspects of the developmental environment. We discuss two categories of such mismatch with reference primarily to nutrition and in the context of evolutionary medicine. The categories operate over very different timescales. A developmental mismatch occurs when the phenotype induced during development encounters a different environment post-development. This may be the result of wider environmental changes, such as nutritional transition between generations, or because maternal malnutrition or placental dysfunction give inaccurate information about the organism’s likely future environment. An evolutionary mismatch occurs when there is an evolutionarily novel environment. Developmental plasticity may involve immediate adaptive responses (IARs) to preserve survival if an environmental challenge is severe, and/or predictive adaptive responses (PARs) if the challenge does not threaten survival, but there is a fitness advantage in developing a phenotype that will be better adapted later. PARs can have long-term adverse health consequences if there is a developmental mismatch. For contemporary humans, maternal constraint of fetal growth makes PARs likely even if there is no obvious IAR, and this, coupled with the pervasive nutritionally dense modern environment, can explain the widespread observations of developmental mismatch, particularly in populations undergoing nutritional transition. Both developmental and evolutionary mismatch have important public health consequences and implications for where policy interventions may be most effective.

"The Effect of Residential Aged Care Size, Ownership Model, and Multichain Affiliation on Resident Comfort and Symptom Management at the End of Life",2019,"Context: In most resource-rich countries, a large and growing proportion of older adults with complex needs will die while in a residential aged care (RAC) facility. Objectives: This study describes the impact of facility size (small/large), ownership model (profit/nonprofit) and provider (independent/chain) on resident comfort, and symptom management as reported by RAC staff. Methods: This retrospective “after-death” study collected decedent resident data from a subsample of 51 hospital-level RAC facilities in New Zealand. Symptom Management at the End-of-Life in Dementia and Comfort Assessment in Dying at End of life with Dementia (SM-EOLD and CAD-EOLD, respectively) scales were used by RAC staff who were closely associated with 217 deceased residents. Data collection occurred from January 2016 to February 2017. Results: Results indicated that residents of large, nonprofit facilities experienced greater comfort at the end of life (CAD-EOLD) as indicated by a higher mean score of 37.21 (SD = 4.85, 95% CI = 34.4, 40.0) than residents of small for-profit facilities who recorded a lower mean score of 31.56 (SD = 6.20, 95% CI = 29.6, 33.4). There was also evidence of better symptom management for residents of chain facilities, with a higher mean score for symptom management (SM-EOLD total score) recorded for residents of chain facilities (mean = 28.07, SD = 7.64, 95% CI = 26.47, 29.66) than the mean score for independent facilities (mean = 23.93, SD = 8.72, 95% CI = 21.65, 26.20). Conclusion: Findings suggest that there are differences in the quality of end-of-life care given in RAC based on size, ownership model, and chain affiliation. ? 2018 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine","adult; aged; Article; Comfort Assessment in Dying at End of life with Dementia scale; dementia; female; health care quality; human; male; model; non profit organization; organization and management; palliative therapy; patient comfort; profit; rating scale; residential home; retrospective study; Symptom Management at the End of Life in Dementia scale; terminal care"
"Therapeutic Hypothermia in Neonatal Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy",2019,"Purpose of Review: Therapeutic hypothermia reduces death or disability in term and near-term infants with moderate-severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy. Nevertheless, many infants still survive with disability, despite hypothermia, supporting further research in to ways to further improve neurologic outcomes. Recent Findings: Recent clinical and experimental studies have refined our understanding of the key parameters for hypothermic neuroprotection, including timing of initiation, depth, and duration of hypothermia, and subsequent rewarming rate. However, important knowledge gaps remain. There is encouraging clinical evidence from a small phase II trial that combined treatment of hypothermia with recombinant erythropoietin further reduces risk of disability but definitive studies are still needed. Summary: In conclusion, recent studies suggest that current protocols for therapeutic hypothermia are near-optimal, and that the key to better neurodevelopmental outcomes is earlier diagnosis and initiation of hypothermia after birth. Further research is essential to find and evaluate ways to further improve outcomes after hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, including add-on therapies for therapeutic hypothermia and preventing pyrexia during labor and delivery. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","recombinant erythropoietin; topiramate; add on therapy; brain damage; clinical protocol; human; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; induced hypothermia; labor; nervous system development; neuroprotection; newborn care; newborn disease; nonhuman; randomized controlled trial (topic); resuscitation; Review; therapy delay; time to treatment; treatment duration; hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy; induced hypothermia; infant; newborn; pathophysiology; procedures; Humans; Hypothermia, Induced; Hypoxia-Ischemia, Brain; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Neuroprotection"
"Nutrients or nursing? Understanding how breast milk feeding affects child cognition",2019,"Purpose: To explore the associations between type of milk feeding (the “nutrients”) and mode of breast milk feeding (the “nursing”) with child cognition. Methods: Healthy children from the GUSTO (Growing Up in Singapore Toward healthy Outcomes) cohort participated in repeated neurodevelopmental assessments between 6 and 54?months. For “nutrients”, we compared children exclusively bottle-fed according to type of milk received: formula only (n = 296) vs some/all breast milk (n = 73). For “nursing”, we included only children who were fully fed breast milk, comparing those fed directly at the breast (n = 59) vs those fed partially/completely by bottle (n = 63). Results: Compared to infants fed formula only, those who were bottle-fed breast milk demonstrated significantly better cognitive performance on both the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development (Third Edition) at 2?years [adjusted mean difference (95% CI) 1.36 (0.32, 2.40)], and on the Kaufman Brief Intelligence Test (Second Edition) at 4.5?years [7.59 (1.20, 13.99)]. Children bottle-fed breast milk also demonstrated better gross motor skills at 2?years than those fed formula [1.60 (0.09, 3.10)]. Among infants fully fed breast milk, those fed directly at the breast scored higher on several memory tasks compared to children bottle-fed breast milk, including the deferred imitation task at 6?months [0.67 (0.02, 1.32)] and relational binding tasks at 6 [0.41 (0.07, 0.74)], 41 [0.67 (0.04, 1.29)] and 54 [0.12 (0.01, 0.22)] months. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that nutrients in breast milk may improve general child cognition, while nursing infants directly at the breast may influence memory. ? 2019, The Author(s).","article; Bayley Scales of Infant Development; breast feeding; breast milk expression; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; human experiment; imitation; infant; intelligence test; major clinical study; male; memory; motor performance; nursing; nutrient; outcome assessment; Singapore"
"Quantifying children’s non-supermarket exposure to alcohol marketing via product packaging using wearable cameras",2019,"Objective: The aim of this research was to quantify children’s exposure to alcohol marketing via product packaging using wearable cameras, observing sociodemographic differences and contextual features of exposure. Method: In Wellington, New Zealand, 167 children (ages 11–13; 53% girls) wore wearable cameras for 4 consecutive days. The cameras automatically captured images approximately every 7 seconds. Image data (n = 700,000 images) were coded through content analysis to determine the extent of children’s exposure to alcohol marketing via product packaging. Negative binomial regression models were used to calculate rates of exposure per day and to examine differences between groups. Results: Children were exposed to alcohol marketing via product packaging 7.7 times per day, on average. Product packaging contained limited health information and lacked defining features that could provide visual cues to children to differentiate alcohol from other commodities. No statistically significant differences by sociodemographic characteristics were detected. Conclusions: Children are frequently exposed to alcohol marketing via product packaging. Such exposure normalizes alcohol in children’s environments and fails to send accurate information to children about the health risks associated with alcohol consumption. Mandatory labeling on alcohol product packaging, including prominent health warnings (text, pictorial, and graphic), or plain packaging, provides governments an opportunity to substantially reduce children’s overall exposure to alcohol marketing and potentially increase children’s awareness of the risks associated with alcohol consumption. ? 2019, Alcohol Research Documentation Inc..

"Vitamin D supplementation improves waist-to-hip ratio and fasting blood glucose in vitamin D deficient, overweight or obese Asians: A pilot secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial",2019,"Recent trials do not support a role for vitamin D supplementation in prevention or treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, although effects may differ in Asian populations. In this pilot secondary analysis of a placebo-controlled randomised trial of overweight or obese individuals with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L), we examined whether vitamin D supplementation improved insulin sensitivity or body composition in participants of Asian ethnicity. Amongst 65 trial participants, 33 reported being of Asian descent (mean ± SD age 30 ± 7 years; 67% male). Participants were block randomised to receive vitamin D (n = 14; initial bolus dose of 2500 μg cholecalciferol followed by 100 μg cholecalciferol/d) or placebo (n = 19; identical capsules) for 16 weeks. Primary outcome was change in insulin sensitivity (M-value) assessed by hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Secondary outcomes were changes in 25(OH)D (chemiluminescent immunoassay), fasting blood glucose (YSI Stat 2300), and body composition including waist-hip ratio and total body fat percentage (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry). Questionnaires assessed sun-exposure habits, physical activity, and diet. After the 16-week intervention, 25(OH)D concentrations increased significantly in the vitamin D group with no change in placebo (61.4 ± 21.1 vs ?0.4 ± 12.7 nmol/L; P < 0.01). Vitamin D group participants demonstrated significant improvements in waist-hip ratio (-0.02 ± 0.03 vs 0.00 ± 0.02; P < 0.01) and fasting blood glucose (?0.1 ± 0.2 vs 0.2 ± 04 mmol/L; P < 0.04) compared with the placebo group, but changes in insulin sensitivity and other body composition measures did not differ significantly between groups (all P > 0.05). In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation improved waist-hip ratio and fasting blood glucose in overweight and obese Asian-Australians with low vitamin D concentrations. Further research is required to determine whether vitamin D supplementation is potentially more effective in specific ethnic groups. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","25 hydroxyvitamin D; colecalciferol; glucose; insulin; placebo; vitamin; vitamin D; adult; Article; Asian; body composition; controlled study; diet restriction; dietary intake; fasting; female; glucose blood level; human; hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp technique; insulin sensitivity; major clinical study; male; obese patient; obesity; outcome assessment; physical activity; pilot study; randomized controlled trial; secondary analysis; sun exposure; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin supplementation; waist hip ratio; analysis; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; complication; diet restriction; obesity; vitamin D deficiency; waist hip ratio; young adult; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Glucose; Fasting; Female; Humans; Male; Obesity; Overweight; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency; Vitamins; Waist-Hip Ratio; Young Adult"
"What does it take to deliver brilliant home-based palliative care? Using positive organisational scholarship and video reflexive ethnography to explore the complexities of palliative care at home",2019,"Background: Despite the increasing number of people requiring palliative care at home, there is limited evidence on how home-based palliative care is best practised. Aim: The aim of this participatory qualitative study is to determine the characteristics that contribute to brilliant home-based palliative care. Design: This study was inspired by the brilliance project – an initiative to explore how positive organisational scholarship in healthcare can be used to study brilliant health service management from the viewpoint of patients, families, and clinicians. The methodology of positive organisational scholarship in healthcare was combined with video-reflexive ethnography. Setting/participants: Home-based specialist palliative care services across two Australian states participated in the study. Clinicians were able to take part in the study at different levels. Pending their preference, this could involve video-recording of palliative care, facilitating and/or participating in reflexive sessions to analyse and critique the recordings, identifying the characteristics that contribute to brilliant home-based palliative care, and/or sharing the findings with others. Results: Brilliance in home-based palliative care is contingent on context and is conceptualised as a variety of actions, people, and processes. Care is more likely to be framed as brilliant when it is epitomised: anticipatory aptitude and action; a weave of commitment; flexible adaptability; and/or team capacity-building. Conclusion: This study is important because it verifies the characteristics of brilliant home-based palliative care. Furthermore, these characteristics can be adapted for use within other services. ?

"Using the Behaviour Change Wheel to explore potential strategies for minimising harms from non-recreational prescription medicine sharing",2019,"Introduction: Non-recreational sharing of prescribed medicines can have positive outcomes under some circumstances, but can also result in negative health outcomes. This paper describes a theoretically underpinned and systematic approach to exploring potential interventions to reduce harm. Methods: Individual, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were conducted with purposively sampled pharmacists (n = 8), doctors (n = 4), nurses (n = 6) and patients (n = 17) from Auckland, New Zealand. Thematic analysis of suggested interventions was undertaken, and these were linked to relevant intervention functions of the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW). Analysis of previously defined factors influencing sharing were mapped onto the “Capability, Opportunity, Motivation – Behaviour” (COM-B) model of the BCW. Results: COM-B analysis of the factors influencing sharing behaviour revealed: (i) ‘Capability’-related factors, such as patient misconceptions about the safety of certain medicines, forgetting to refill or to carry around own medicines, and lack of knowledge about safe disposal of leftover/unused medicines; (ii) ‘Opportunity’-related factors included lack of access to health facilities, lack of time to see a doctor, linguistic and cultural barriers, lack of information from healthcare providers about risks of sharing, and having leftover/unused medicines, and (iii) ‘Motivation’-related factors included altruism, illness denial, embarrassment about seeing a doctor, not carrying around own medicines, habit, and fear of negative health consequences from missing a few doses of medicines. Five intervention functions of the BCW appear to be the most likely candidates for targeting the factors which relate to medicine sharing. These are education, persuasion, enablement, environmental restructuring and restriction. Conclusions: A variety of personal and external factors which influence sharing behaviours were identified, and the BCW provided a means by which theoretically underpinned interventions to reduce potential harms from this behaviour could be proposed. The findings can help with the design of approaches to reduce harm associated with non-recreational medicine sharing. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.Article synopsis: Medicine sharing can result in negative health outcomes; thus, systematically developed interventions to reduce potential harms from medicine-sharing are required. This qualitative study used the ‘Behaviour Change Wheel’ (BCW) to apply a theory-based approach to identifying (a) factors influencing patients' non-recreational prescription medicine sharing behaviours and (b) potential interventions. The findings indicate that factors related to ‘Capability’ (knowledge and cognitive skills), ‘Opportunity’ (environmental factors), and ‘Motivation’ (‘brain processes that energize and direct behaviour’) influence medicine sharing behaviours. Education, persuasion, enablement, environmental restructuring, and restriction appear to be the most suitable BCW intervention functions to target factors influencing medicine sharing. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","adult; altruism; article; behavior change; brain; clinical article; education; environmental factor; fear; female; health care facility; human; interview; male; medicine; motivation; New Zealand; nurse; persuasive communication; pharmacist; prescription; qualitative research; skill; thematic analysis; theoretical study; aged; attitude to health; health behavior; health care personnel; middle aged; motivation; patient; psychology; young adult; prescription drug; Adult; Aged; Attitude to Health; Female; Health Behavior; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; New Zealand; Patients; Prescription Drugs; Young Adult"
"Clinical management and outcomes of acute pancreatitis: Identifying areas for quality improvement in a tertiary Asian setting",2019,"Background: This study aims to review the clinical management of patients with acute pancreatitis in a tertiary institute in Singapore, and to identify areas qualiy improvement based on validation against the recommendations in the IAP/APA and the Japanese guidelines. Methods: 391 patients from a prospective electronic database were included and reviewed for compliance to the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP)/American Pancreatic Association (APA) guidelines (2013) and the Japanase Guidelines (2015). Results: The 90 day mortality was 8.4% for moderately severe and 11.9% for severe pancreatitis. The accuracy of SIRS in predicting severe acute pancreatitis on admission was 72.1% and at 48 h 80.8%. Only 61.1% patients had ultrasound scan during their admission of whom 32.9% had it within 24 h of admission. 18.3% patients with initial diagnosis of idiopathic pancreatitis had EUS. 50% received Ringer lactate for initial fluid resuscitation. 38.7% received antibiotics as prophylaxis. 21.4% with severe acute pancreatitis had early enteral nutrition. Only 21.4% patients with biliary pancreatitis had index admission cholecystectomy. Conclusion: The compliance to existing guidelines for management of acute pancreatitis is variable.

"The anatomical pathology of gout: A systematic literature review",2019,"Background: The aim of this systematic literature review was to comprehensively describe the anatomical pathology of tissues affected by gout. Methods: We searched PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), and Web of Science Core Collection for all English language articles published before March 2018. Articles were included if they described the microscopic or macroscopic appearances of gout in human tissue. Results: Four hundred and seventeen articles met inclusion criteria and were included in the review. Articles describing the anatomical pathology of gout in musculoskeletal structures, including bone, tendon and ligaments, synovium and cartilage, were most common. Articles describing skin and kidney pathology in gout were also common, with pathology in other sites such as visceral organs less common. At all sites, monosodium urate crystal deposition was reported, and the tophus was also described within many different tissues. During a gout flare, diffuse acute neutrophilic synovial inflammation was evident. The tophus was described as an organised chronic giant cell granulomatous structure consisting of monosodium urate crystals, innate and adaptive immune cells, and fibrovascular tissue. Conclusions: Consistent with the clinical presentation of gout, most studies describing the anatomical pathology of gout report involvement of musculoskeletal structures, with monosodium urate crystal deposition and tophus the most common lesions described. This review details the anatomical pathology features of gout at affected sites. ? 2019 The Author(s).","urate; uric acid; bone disease; chondropathy; crystal deposition; disease exacerbation; electron microscopy; gout; human; immunohistochemistry; joint capsule; kidney disease; knee meniscus; ligament disease; microscopy; muscle disease; musculoskeletal disease; pathology; Review; skin disease; spine disease; synovial bursa; synovitis; systematic review; tendon disease; tophus; anatomy and histology; gout; kidney; metabolism; musculoskeletal system; skin; Gout; Humans; Kidney; Musculoskeletal System; Skin; Uric Acid"

"Cross-sectional associations of vitamin D status with asthma prevalence, exacerbations, and control in New Zealand adults",2019,"Background: Previous studies, mostly with children, have reported inconsistent findings on the associations of vitamin D status with asthma prevalence, exacerbations, and control. Because of limited research with adults, we examined these associations in a large community-based sample of New Zealand adults. Methods: 5110 participants, aged 50–84 years, were recruited from the community into a clinical trial of vitamin D supplementation. The current analysis is based on baseline blood sample collection to measure serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D), which was deseasonalized for data analyses; and baseline asthma assessment, which included questions on asthma prevalence, urgent medical care for asthma in the previous 12 months, and control of asthma symptoms in the previous 4 weeks. Results: 702 (13.2%) of 5088 participants reported having doctor-diagnosed asthma. There was no difference in mean (SE) 25(OH)D concentration between participants with and without asthma: 66 (0.9) and 66 (0.4) nmol/L, respectively, adjusting for sex (p = 0.71). However, in multivariable analyses restricted to participants who reported having asthma, mean (SE) 25(OH)D concentration was 6.3 (2.6) nmol/L lower in those who reported having urgent medical care for asthma in the previous 12 months compared to others (p = 0.02), and 10.4 (3.9) nmol/L lower in those with very poor asthma control compared to those who were well-controlled (p = 0.03). Conclusion: These cross-sectional results suggest that asthmatic adults with lower vitamin D status are more likely to receive urgent asthma medical care and to experience poor asthma control. Clinical trials are needed to determine the role of vitamin D supplementation in asthma management. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","25 hydroxyvitamin D; vitamin D; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; vitamin; vitamin D; adult; aged; Article; asthma; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease control; disease exacerbation; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical care; New Zealand; very elderly; vitamin blood level; ambulatory care; analogs and derivatives; asthma; blood; complication; middle aged; prevalence; randomized controlled trial; vitamin D deficiency; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care; Asthma; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Prevalence; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency; Vitamins"
"Decomposing ethnic differences in body mass index and obesity rates among New Zealand pre-schoolers",2019,"Objective: To determine the extent to which ethnic differences in BMI Z-scores and obesity rates could be explained by the differential distribution of demographic (e.g. age), familial (e.g. family income), area (e.g. area deprivation), parental (e.g. immigration status), and birth (e.g. gestational age) characteristics across ethnic groups. Methods: We used data on 4-year-old children born in New Zealand who attended the B4 School Check between the fiscal years of 2010/2011 to 2015/2016, who were resident in the country when the 2013 census was completed (n = 253,260). We implemented an Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition to explain differences in BMI Z-score and obesity between M?ori (n = 63,061) and European (n = 139,546) children, and Pacific (n = 21,527) and European children. Results: Overall, 15.2% of the children were obese and mean BMI Z-score was 0.66 (SD = 1.04). The Oaxaca–Blinder decomposition demonstrated that the difference in obesity rates between M?ori and European children would halve if M?ori children experienced the same familial and area level conditions as Europeans. If Pacific children had the same characteristics as European children, differences in obesity rates would reduce by approximately one third, but differences in mean BMI Z-scores would only reduce by 16.1%. Conclusion: The differential distribution of familial, parental, area, and birth characteristics across ethnic groups explain a substantial percentage of the ethnic differences in obesity, especially for M?ori compared to European children. However, marked disparities remain. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","Article; birth weight; body mass; child; childhood obesity; ethnic difference; ethnic group; European; family income; female; gestational age; human; immigration; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); methodology; New Zealand; parent; preschool child; priority journal; rural area; urban area"
"Anticipatory effects of the implementation of the Chilean Law of Food Labeling and Advertising on food and beverage product reformulation",2019,"This study evaluated the anticipated food and beverage product reformulation by industry before the Chilean Law of Food Labeling and Advertising (Law 20.606) was implemented in June 2016 requiring a front-of-package (FOP) warning label for products high in sodium, total sugars, saturated fats, and/or total energy. Fieldworkers photographed a purposive sample of packaged food and beverage products in February 2015 (n?=?5421) and February 2016 (n?=?5479) from six different supermarkets in Santiago, Chile. The same products collected in both years (n?=?2086) from 17 food and beverage categories with added critical nutrients (nutrients of concern: sodium, total sugars, and saturated fats) were included in this longitudinal study. The average change in energy and critical nutrient content was estimated by category. The number of warning labels potentially avoided because of reformulation was determined. Between February 2015 and February 2016, no category experienced reductions >5% average change in energy or critical nutrient content; and some increased in critical nutrient content. Few products (<2%) would have avoided at least one warning label with reformulation. In a diverse sample of food and beverage products, there was minimal reformulation by industry in anticipation of the implementation of the 2016 Chilean Law of Food Labeling and Advertising. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation","oatmeal; saturated fatty acid; sodium; sugar; yoghurt; Article; beverage; bread; candy; cheese; Chile; chocolate; consumer; cookie; dairy product; energy; fast food; fish; food packaging; grain; human; ice cream; law; longitudinal study; milk; nut; nutrient content; pastry; processed meat; purposive sample; sea food"

"Mismatches between health service delivery and community expectations in the provision of secondary prophylaxis for rheumatic fever in New Zealand",2019,"Objective: Rheumatic fever (RF) recurrence prevention requires secondary prophylaxis for at least ten years. However, recurrences of rheumatic fever (RRF) persist disproportionately affecting M?ori and Pacific youth. Reasons for recurrence rates are not well understood and commonly attributed to patient non-adherence. This research explored M?ori and Pacific family experiences of RRF to better understand barriers to accessing secondary prophylaxis to inform health service improvements. Methods: Participants were M?ori and Pacific patients who had RRF or unexpected rheumatic heart disease and their family; and health professionals working in RF contexts. Kaupapa M?ori, Talanga and Kakala Pacific qualitative methodologies were employed. Data were thematically analysed using a general inductive approach. Results: Data collection included 38 interviews with patients and families (n=80), six focus group interviews and nine interviews with health providers (n=33) from seven geographic regions. Three key themes were identified where mismatches occurred between services and community needs: 1. Model of delivery; 2. Interpersonal approaches to care; and 3. Adolescent care. Conclusions and Public health implications: Successful RRF prevention requires interventions to address structural causes of inequity, appropriate clinical guidelines and quality health services. Service-delivery models should provide regular prophylaxis in an accessible manner through culturally-safe, community-based, age-appropriate care. ? 2019 The Authors","adolescent; attitude to health; epidemiology; ethnology; female; health care delivery; human; indigenous health care; information processing; interview; male; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; organization and management; procedures; psychology; qualitative research; rheumatic fever; rheumatic heart disease; secondary prevention; statistics and numerical data; Adolescent; Attitude to Health; Delivery of Health Care; Female; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Qualitative Research; Rheumatic Fever; Rheumatic Heart Disease; Secondary Prevention"

"Stimulants: How big is the problem and what are the effects of prenatal exposure?",2019,"Globally, cocaine use increased by 7%–18.2 million people in 2016 or 0.4% of the world population aged 15–64. In 2016, over 34 million (0.7%) people aged 15–64 used amphetamines and a further 0.4% used MDMA (Ecstasy). Women of child bearing age worldwide are increasingly using and becoming dependent on stimulants; and are, in turn, more vulnerable to sexually transmitted diseases, sexual violence, unplanned pregnancies and mental health problems. Stimulant use during pregnancy increases obstetric complications for the mother, increases the rate of preterm birth and decreases birth weight, length and head circumference for the exposed infant. No consistent signs of neonatal abstinence syndrome requiring pharmacological treatment have been identified for cocaine or methamphetamine, however, infants exposed to one or both drugs exhibit disorganized neurobehaviour at birth. Increased efforts worldwide are needed to determine the extent of maternal stimulant use and to prevent or identify and treat substance use early during pregnancy. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","central stimulant agent; cocaine; methamphetamine; midomafetamine; cocaine; birth weight; body height; cognition; drug dependence; head circumference; human; mental disease; motivation; neonatal abstinence syndrome; nonhuman; postnatal care; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; premature labor; prenatal care; prenatal drug exposure; prevalence; Review; self report; sexual violence; sexually transmitted disease; substance use; symptom; unplanned pregnancy; vulnerable population; complication; drug dependence; female; labor complication; newborn; prenatal exposure; Cocaine; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Obstetric Labor Complications; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Substance-Related Disorders"
"Dental caries and previous hospitalisations among preschool children:Findings from a population-based study in New Zealand",2019,"Early childhood caries (ECC) is a significant public health problem, and may be associated with other health conditions.? Aim To investigate whether an association exists between ECC and previous hospitalisations due to avoidable medical conditions, including injury-related admissions among preschool children. Method This population-based retrospective study involves all five-year old children who resided in one of the two contiguous regions in northern New Zealand (Northland and Auckland) and received school entry dental examinations between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2015. Eligible children were identified from the regional dental datasets (Titanium? software), and their ECC status was determined by using decayed missing filled teeth (dmft) scores. Information on hospitalisations for avoidable medical conditions, which occurred during the first six years of life, was obtained through linkage to hospital discharge data. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the associations between ECC and previous hospitalisations. Results 11,173 of the 27,333 eligible children (40.9%) had ECC (dmft ?1). Children from non-European ethnic origins (M?ori, Pacific and Asian groups) and those from the Northland, areas without community water fluoridation or deprived neighbourhoods, were more likely to have ECC. ECC was significantly associated with injury-related admissions (adjusted odds ratio: 1.17; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.27), but not with admissions for other medical and respiratory conditions. Conclusion ECC was highly prevalent in New Zealand children, and associated with injury-related hospital admissions. The findings underscore more efforts to tackle ECC and associated health conditions. ? 2019, New Zealand Medical Association.

"Altered gut microbiome after bariatric surgery and its association with metabolic benefits: A systematic review",2019,"Bariatric surgery is currently the recommended therapy for significant weight reduction and remission of type 2 diabetes. Different types of bariatric surgery result in dramatic changes to gut bacteria but the contribution of such changes to the metabolic benefits achieved is still unclear. This systematic review of 14 clinical studies, incorporating 222 participants (146 patients with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, 25 with sleeve gastrectomy, 30 with biliointestinal bypass, 7 with vertical banded gastroplasty, and 14 with an adjustable gastric band)reveals generally increased microbial diversity and gene richness after surgery. Major species-level changes include a decrease in the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and increase in Escherichia coli. Decreases in the relative abundance of Firmicutes after sleeve gastrectomy and increases in Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass were seen. Microbial changes after surgery are discussed in the context of potential confounding effects of baseline diet, medications, and type 2 diabetes, with recommendations to consider these factors in future studies, to identify potentially causal associations with observed metabolic benefits. ? 2019 American Society for Bariatric Surgery","altered gut microbiome; Bacteroidetes; bariatric surgery; biliointestinal bypass; body weight loss; caloric restriction; case control study; clinical study; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; Desulfovibrio; Escherichia coli; Faecalibacterium prausnitzii; Firmicutes; gastroplasty; human; intestine flora; meta analysis; metabolic parameters; microbial diversity; microbiome; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; postoperative complication; priority journal; prospective study; Proteobacteria; randomized controlled trial (topic); remission; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; Roseburia intestinalis; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; sleeve gastrectomy; species difference; systematic review; vertical banded gastroplasty"
"Effects of Intravenous Zoledronate on Bone Turnover and Bone Density Persist for at Least 11 Years in HIV-Infected Men",2019,"Previously we reported the results of a 4-year extension of a 2-year randomized placebo-controlled trial showing that the antiresorptive effects of two annual 4-mg doses of zoledronate in HIV-infected men persisted for at least 5 years after the second dose. We set out to determine whether the effects on BMD and bone turnover persist beyond 10 years. We invited all participants in the original trial known to be alive and living in New Zealand to attend an additional visit approximately 12 years after trial entry and 11 years after their second dose of study medication. The outcome measures were BMD at the lumbar spine, proximal femur, and total body, and markers of bone turnover. Twenty-five of the 43 men originally enrolled in the trial attended the final visit, representing 25 of 31 (81%) participants alive and residing in New Zealand at the time. The average duration of follow-up was 12.4 years. At the final visit, BMD remained higher in the zoledronate group than the placebo group (lumbar spine 3.7%, 95% CI, 0.1 to 7.3; total hip 3.7%, 95% CI, 1.2 to 6.2; femoral neck 5.0%, 95% CI, 2.1 to 7.9; total body 2.4%, 95% CI, 0.7 to 4.0), and the between-group differences in BMD remained stable between 6 and 12 years. Serum CTx remained lower in the zoledronate group than the placebo group between 6 and 12 years and, at the final visit, was 45% lower (95% CI, 25 to 64) than the placebo group. P1NP was 26% (95% CI, 4 to 48) lower in the zoledronate group than the placebo group at the final visit. In summary, two annual 4-mg doses of zoledronate have effects on bone turnover and BMD in men that persist for at least 11 years after the second dose. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research","collagen; collagen type 1; placebo; procollagen type I N terminal propeptide; tenofovir; unclassified drug; zoledronic acid; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; bone density; bone turnover; clinical article; femoral neck; fracture; hip; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; lumbar spine; male; middle aged; New Zealand; protein blood level; proximal femur; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment duration; virus load"
"Paediatric intentional head injuries in the emergency department: A multicentre prospective cohort study",2019,"Objective: Although there is a large body of research on head injury (HI) inflicted by caregivers in young children, little is known about intentional HI in older children and inflicted HI by perpetrators other than carers. Therefore, we set out to describe epidemiology, demographics and severity of intentional HIs in childhood. Methods: A planned secondary analysis of a prospective multicentre cohort study was conducted in 10 EDs in Australia and New Zealand, including children aged <18 years with HIs. Epidemiology codes were used to prospectively code the injuries. Demographic and clinical information including the rate of clinically important traumatic brain injury (ciTBI: HI leading to death, neurosurgery, intubation >1 day or admission ?2 days with abnormal computed tomography [CT]) was descriptively analysed. Results: Intentional injuries were identified in 372 of 20 137 (1.8%) head-injured children. Injuries were caused by caregivers (103, 27.7%), by peers (97, 26.1%), by siblings (47, 12.6%), by strangers (35, 9.4%), by persons with unknown relation to the patient (21, 5.6%), other intentional injuries (8, 2.2%) or undetermined intent (61, 16.4%). About 75.7% of victims of assault by caregivers were <2 years, whereas in other categories, only 4.9% were <2 years. Overall, 66.9% of victims were male. Rates of CT performance and abnormal CT varied: assault by caregivers 68.9%/47.6%, by peers 18.6%/27.8%, by strangers 37.1%/5.7%. ciTBI rate was 22.3% in assault by caregivers, 3.1% when caused by peers and 0.0% with other perpetrators. Conclusions: Intentional HI is infrequent in children. The most frequently identified perpetrators are caregivers and peers. Caregiver injuries are particularly severe. ? 2018 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine","adolescent; adult; Article; assault; brain hemorrhage; child; childhood injury; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; contusion; disease severity; emergency ward; fatality; female; groups by age; head injury; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; offender; pediatric intentional head injury; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; school child; sex difference; skull fracture; traumatic brain injury; unconsciousness"
"Paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation: Knowledge and perceptions of surf lifeguards",2019,"Aim: To conduct a comprehensive analysis of surf lifeguards' real and perceived ability in paediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), knowledge of child resuscitation protocols and technical competency during a simulated CPR scenario. Methods: Surf lifeguards aged 16 years and over were invited to complete a written survey and simulated test of five cycles of single-rescuer CPR on a paediatric manikin. In accordance with the latest Australia and New Zealand Committee on Resuscitation (ANZCOR) guidelines, practical skills were assessed by trained observers. A manikin fitted with electronic data-collection capability recorded technical compression and ventilation skills. Results: A total of 244 participants were entered into the study. Most previous CPR training did not include a paediatric component (53%). Lifeguards rated their ability to perform CPR on an adult as ‘highly effective’ or ‘effective’ in 56% of responses. Less than a quarter (23%), however, gave this response when compared to a child. Observed CPR skills were mostly compliant with ANZCOR guidelines (80–99%). Manikin data provided a median compression rate of 115.6 min ?1 , compression depth of 3.7 cm and tidal volume of 220.0 mL. Almost half of ventilations were too little (45%), and around one fifth were too much (22%). Conclusions: Surf lifeguards are less confident in paediatric CPR. The overall performance of observed and technical CPR skills, which were mostly ANZCOR guideline compliant, suggests that performance could be improved if paediatric-specific training is provided to supplement the adult-focused methods currently in use. The use of electronic feedback manikins is recommended to address the technical compression and ventilation issues identified in this study. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","adult; Article; child safety; compression; controlled study; female; human; male; nonmedical occupations; practice guideline; priority journal; professional competence; professional knowledge; protocol compliance; resuscitation; staff training; surf lifeguard; tidal volume; work experience; young adult"

"Plasma folate and its association with folic acid supplementation, socio-demographic and lifestyle factors among New Zealand pregnant women",2019,"Folic acid (FA) supplementation is recommended in the periconceptional period, for the prevention of neural tube defects. Limited data are available on the folate status of New Zealand (NZ) pregnant women and its association with FA supplementation intake. Objectives were to examine the relationship between plasma folate (PF) and reported FA supplement use at 15 weeks' gestation and to explore socio-demographic and lifestyle factors associated with PF. We used data and blood samples from NZ participants of the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints cohort study. Healthy nulliparous women with singleton pregnancy (n 1921) were interviewed and blood samples collected. PF was analysed via microbiological assay. Of the participants, 73 % reported taking an FA supplement at 15 weeks' gestation - of these, 79 % were taking FA as part of/alongside a multivitamin supplement. Of FA supplement users, 56 % reported consuming a daily dose of ?800 μg; 39 % reported taking less than 400 g/d. Mean PF was significantly higher in women reporting FA supplementation (54·6 (se 1·5) nmol/l) v. no FA supplementation (35·1 (se 1·6) nmol/l) (P<0·0001). Reported daily FA supplement dose and PF were significantly positively correlated (r 0·41; P<0·05). Younger maternal age, Pacific and Maori ethnicity and obesity were negatively associated with PF levels; vegetarianism was positively associated with PF. Reported FA supplement dose was significantly associated with PF after adjustment for socio-demographic, lifestyle confounders and multivitamin intake. The relationship observed between FA supplementation and PF demonstrates that self-reported intake is a reliable proxy for FA supplement use in this study population. ? 2019 The Authors.","folic acid; adult; Article; body mass; controlled study; cross-sectional study; demography; female; first trimester pregnancy; folic acid blood level; gestational age; human; lifestyle modification; Maori (people); maternal age; maternal obesity; nullipara; Pacific Islander; population research; pregnancy; pregnant woman; reliability; retrospective study; vegetarian diet; vitamin supplementation"

We examined personal and group discrimination from the 2013 wave of the New Zealand Attitudes and Values Study (n = 429 women and 196 men). Personal discrimination was associated with poorer health and well-being outcomes (higher psychological distress and lower self-esteem, subjective evaluation of health, satisfaction with life and personal well-being). Group discrimination, in contrast, was associated with poorer well-being but not health outcomes (lower subjective evaluation of health and personal well-being). These findings corroborate previous research and highlight the corrosive effect of discrimination towards health and well-being among Pacific communities in New Zealand. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; article; controlled study; corrosion; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental stress; New Zealand; satisfaction; self esteem; wellbeing"
"Catecholaminergic Polymorphic Ventricular Tachycardia: The Cardiac Arrest Where Epinephrine Is Contraindicated?",2019,"Objectives: To raise awareness among pediatric intensive care specialists of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; an uncommon cause of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation arrest in children and young adults where epinephrine (adrenaline), even when given according to international protocols, can be counter-productive and life-threatening. We review three cases of cardiac arrest in children, later proven to be catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia related, where delay in recognition of this condition resulted in significantly longer resuscitation efforts, more interventions, and a longer time to return of spontaneous circulation. Design: Retrospective case series. Setting: Tertiary children's hospital. Patients and Results: Three previously well children 4, 5, and 10 years old presented with cardiac arrest triggered by light activity, partial water immersion, and running, respectively. Initial resuscitation was bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and community defibrillation in all three cases. Electrocardiograms revealed multifocal ventricular ectopy, and in two (4 and 10 yr old), this correlated with repeated administration of epinephrine during repeated ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest resuscitation cycles. This ultimately resolved immediately (at 78 and 140 min, respectively) with IV opiates once catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia was suspected. During recovery, on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, epinephrine challenge in two children induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, bidirectional ventricular tachycardia, and ventricular fibrillation, which was cardioverted with flecainide in the 4-year-old. The third case was recognized early as catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and was managed by avoiding epinephrine and using opiates and general anesthesia after the initial (single) cardioversion, and had a much better clinical course, without recourse to extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. All three carried de novo RyR2 (cardiac ryanodine) mutations. Conclusions: Those involved in resuscitation of young people should be aware of catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and be suspicious of persistent ventricular ectopy, polymorphic, or bidirectional ventricular tachycardia during resuscitation. Appropriate management is avoidance of epinephrine, administration of general anesthesia, IV opiates, and consideration of flecainide.

"The International comparison of Systems of care and patient outcomes In minor Stroke and Tia (InSIST) study: A community-based cohort study",2019,"Rationale: Rapid response by health-care systems for transient ischemic attack and minor stroke (TIA/mS) is recommended to maximize the impact of secondary prevention strategies. The applicability of this evidence to Australian non-hospital-based TIA/mS management is uncertain. Aims: Within an Australian community setting we seek to document processes of care, establish determinants of access to care, establish attack rates and determinants of recurrent vascular events and other clinical outcomes, establish the performance of ABC2-risk stratification, and compare the processes of care and outcomes to those in the UK and New Zealand for TIA/mS. Sample size estimates: Recruiting practices containing approximately 51 full-time-equivalent general practitioners to recruit 100 TIA/mS per year over a four-year study period will provide sufficient power for each of our outcomes. Methods and design: An inception cohort study of patients with possible TIA/mS recruited from 16 general practices in the Newcastle-Hunter Valley-Manning Valley region of Australia. Potential TIA/mS will be ascertained by multiple overlapping methods at general practices, after-hours collaborative, and hospital in-patient and outpatient services. Participants’ index and subsequent clinical events will be adjudicated as TIA/mS or mimics by an expert panel. Study outcomes: Process outcomes—whether the patient was referred for secondary care; time from event to first patient presentation to a health professional; time from event to specialist acute-access clinic appointment; time from event to brain and vascular imaging and relevant prescriptions. Clinical outcomes—recurrent stroke and major vascular events; and health-related quality of life. Discussion: Community management of TIA/mS will be informed by this study. ? 2019 World Stroke Organization.","aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; controlled study; health care access; health care delivery; health care quality; human; minor stroke; outcome assessment; outpatient care; patient care; patient referral; priority journal; risk assessment; risk stratification; transient ischemic attack; Australia; cerebrovascular accident; comparative study; New Zealand; outcome assessment; participatory research; prevalence; quality of life; recurrent disease; risk; transient ischemic attack; United Kingdom; Australia; Cohort Studies; Community-Based Participatory Research; Delivery of Health Care; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; New Zealand; Patient Outcome Assessment; Prevalence; Quality of Life; Recurrence; Risk; Stroke; United Kingdom"
"Nasal microbial composition and chronic otitis media with effusion: A case-control study",2019,"Objectives Chronic otitis media with effusion (COME) in children can cause prolonged hearing loss, which is associated with an increased risk of learning delays and behavioural problems. Dispersal of bacterial pathogens from the nasal passages to the middle ear is implicated in COME. We sought to determine whether there is an association between nasal microbial composition and COME in children. Methods A case-control study of children aged 3 and 4 years was conducted. Cases undergoing placement of tympanostomy tubes for COME were compared to healthy controls. Nasal swabs were collected and a questionnaire was administered. The V1-3 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified, and sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq. Results 73 children with COME had a lower Shannon diversity index than 105 healthy controls (1.62 [.80] versus 1.88 [.84], respectively; P = .046). The nasal microbiota of cases and controls differed in composition using Bray-Curtis dissimilarity (p = 0.002). Children with COME had a higher abundance of otopathogens and lower abundance of commensals including alpha haemolytic Streptococci and Lactococcus. Cluster analysis revealed 4 distinct nasal microbial profiles. Profiles that were Corynebacterium-dominated (aOR 4.18 [95%CI, 1.68–10.39], Streptococcus-dominated (aOR 3.12 [95%CI, 1.08–9.06], or Moraxella-dominated (aOR 4.70 [95%CI, 1.73–12.80] were associated with COME, compared to a more mixed microbial profile when controlling for age, ethnicity, and recent antibiotics use. Conclusions Children with COME have a less diverse nasal microbial composition with a higher abundance of pathogens, compared to healthy children who have a more mixed bacterial profile with a higher abundance of commensals. Further research is required to determine how nasal microbiota may relate to the pathogenesis or maintenance of COME, and whether modification of the nasal microbiota can prevent or treat children at risk of COME. ? 2019 Walker et al.

"Prevalence and predictors of medicine saving and future prescription medicine sharing: findings from a New Zealand online survey",2019,"Objectives: To assess the prevalence of and factors predicting future prescription medicine sharing behaviours among adults in New Zealand (NZ). The prevalence and predictors of having leftover medicines at home and the relationship between medicine storing and sharing practices were also explored. Methods: An online, self-administered survey of a convenience sample of NZ adults was conducted. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between explanatory and outcome variables. Key findings: Two hundred and thirty three participants took part, who were mostly members of patient support groups across NZ. A high prevalence of leftover medicine storing practices (72.4%), future prescription medicine borrowing (72.8%) and lending (68.7%) behaviours was documented. Over half of the participants (57.1%) had never received advice from healthcare providers about the safe disposal of medicines, and 79.7% reported never having received information about risks of medicine sharing from healthcare providers. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, high income, having asthma and having leftover medicines stored at home were found to be positive predictors of future medicine lending or borrowing intentions. Further, high income was a positive predictor of having leftover medicines stored at home. Conversely, those with hypertension would be less likely to lend or borrow medicines. Conclusions: The high prevalence of leftover medicine storing practices and future medicine sharing intentions among adults in NZ suggests it may be beneficial to provide patient and public education about appropriate use of prescribed medicines and safe medicine disposal procedures. Further research is needed to elicit effective strategies to reduce leftover medicines and unsafe medicine sharing practices. ? 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society","antihypertensive agent; cardiovascular agent; prescription drug; prescription drug; adult; aged; Article; asthma; female; health behavior; health care personnel; health survey; home; human; hypertension; income; male; multivariate logistic regression analysis; New Zealand; outcome assessment; prescription medicine sharing behavior; prevalence; priority journal; adolescent; drug storage; health education; middle aged; prevalence; procedures; questionnaire; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Drug Storage; Female; Health Behavior; Health Education; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Prescription Drugs; Prevalence; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Assessment of packaged foods and beverages carrying nutrition marketing against Canada’s food guide recommendations",2019,"Canadians’ food purchases consist largely of packaged processed and ultra-processed products, which typically fall outside the “core” foods recommended by Canada’s Food Guide (CFG). Almost half of packaged products in Canada carry nutrition marketing (i.e., nutrient content and health claims). This study assessed whether packaged foods carrying nutrition marketing align with recommendations outlined in the 2007 CFG. Label data (n = 9376) were extracted from the 2013 Food Label Information Program (FLIP). Label components (including nutrition marketing) were classified using the International Network for Food and Obesity/NCDs Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS) labelling taxonomy. The Health Canada Surveillance Tool (HCST) was used to assess the alignment of products to CFG. Each food or beverage was classified into one of five groups (i.e., Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, Tier 4, “Others”). Products in Tier 1, 2 or water were considered “in line with CFG”. Most products in the analyzed sample were classified as Tier 2 (35%) and Tier 3 (27%). Although foods with nutrition marketing were significantly more likely to align to CFG recommendations (p < 0.001), many products not “in line with CFG” still carried nutrition marketing. This study provides important baseline data that could be used upon the implementation of the new CFG. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Basic Calcium Phosphate Crystals Induce Osteoarthritis-Associated Changes in Phenotype Markers in Primary Human Chondrocytes by a Calcium/Calmodulin Kinase 2-Dependent Mechanism",2019,"Chondrocytes in osteoarthritis undergo a phenotype shift leading to increased production of cartilage-degrading enzymes. There are similarities between the phenotype of osteoarthritic chondrocytes and those of growth plate chondrocytes. Hydroxyapatite can promote chondrocyte differentiation in the growth plate. Basic calcium phosphate (BCP) crystals (which consist of hydroxyapatite, octacalcium apatite and tricalcium phosphate) are frequently found in osteoarthritic joints. The objective of this study was to determine whether BCP crystals induce disease-associated changes in phenotypic marker expression in chondrocytes. Primary human chondrocytes isolated from macroscopically normal cartilage were treated with BCP for up to 48?h. Expression of indian hedgehog (IHH), matrix metalloproteinase 13 (MMP13), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and type X collagen (COLX) were higher, and expression of sry-box 9 (SOX9) lower, in BCP-treated chondrocytes (50??g/mL) compared to untreated controls. COLX protein was also present in BCP-treated chondrocytes. Intracellular calcium and levels of phosphorylated and total calcium/calmodulin kinase 2 (CaMK2) were elevated following BCP treatment due to BCP-induced release of calcium from intracellular stores. CaMK2 inhibition or knockdown ameliorated the BCP-induced changes in SOX9, IHH, COLX, IL-6 and MMP13 expression. BCP crystals induce osteoarthritis-associated changes in phenotypic marker expression in chondrocytes by calcium-mediated activation of CaMK2. The presence of BCP crystals in osteoarthritic joints may contribute to disease progression. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","beta actin; calcium; calcium calmodulin dependent protein kinase II; calcium phosphate; collagen type 10; collagenase 3; hydroxyapatite; interleukin 6; n [2 [[n [3 (4 chlorophenyl) 2 propenyl] n methylamino]methyl]phenyl] n (2 hydroxyethyl) 4 methoxybenzenesulfonamide; prostaglandin E2; sonic hedgehog protein; transcription factor HES 1; transcription factor Sox9; Article; calcium cell level; calcium transport; chondrocyte; controlled study; crystal; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme phosphorylation; human; human cell; osteoarthritis; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Western blotting"
"Associations between intra-pancreatic fat deposition and circulating levels of cytokines",2019,"While a plethora of studies have been conducted to investigate the associations between pro-inflammatory cytokines and obesity, the inter-relationship between pro-inflammatory cytokines and intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) has been poorly investigated. In the present study, circulating levels of C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin-6 (IL-6), leptin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα) were measured in 90 individuals after acute pancreatitis (AP) as well as 21 healthy non-obese individuals. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify IPFD and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat volume ratio by two independent raters. Linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations between IPFD and each cytokine, adjusting for demographic, metabolic, and pancreatitis-related factors, as well as abdominal fat distribution. In healthy non-obese individuals, IPFD was not significantly associated with any of the studied cytokines in both the unadjusted and adjusted models. In individuals after AP, IPFD was significantly associated with leptin in the models adjusted for age and sex (β = 0.063 [95% confidence interval: 0.007, 0.119], P = 0.026); age, sex, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat volume ratio, glycated hemoglobin, and pancreatitis-related factors (β = 0.056 [95% confidence interval: 0.000, 0.111], P = 0.049). Also, IPFD was significantly associated with TNFα in the unadjusted model (β = 0.102 [95% confidence interval: 0.002, 0.202], P = 0.045) and the model adjusted for age, sex, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat volume ratio, glycated hemoglobin, and pancreatitis-related factors (β = 0.128 [95% confidence interval: 0.034, 0.223], P = 0.008). The associations between IPFD and IL-6, CCL2 were not statistically significant, in both the unadjusted and adjusted models. These findings indicate that leptin and TNFα are associated with IPFD independent of abdominal fat distribution and other covariates in individuals after AP. The role of IPFD in low-grade inflammation warrants further investigations. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","cytokine; glycosylated hemoglobin; interleukin 6; leptin; macrophage derived chemokine; tumor necrosis factor; acute pancreatitis; adipose tissue; adult; age; aged; Article; body fat distribution; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; female; gender; human; human tissue; intra pancreatic fat; intra-abdominal fat; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; subcutaneous fat"
"The nature and timing of distress among post-treatment haematological cancer survivors",2019,"Many people with haematological cancers will not meet the diagnostic criteria for a psychological disorder, but will still suffer distress during treatment and beyond. The current study aimed to explore the nature and timing of psychosocial distress experienced by haematological cancer survivors. Twenty-three post-treatment haematological cancer survivors participated in a semi-structured interview. Data were analysed using thematic analysis which involved identifying, analysing and reporting themes. Four themes were identified: Apprehension about leaving the safety of the health care system comprises the struggles encountered when transitioning from patient to survivor, Uncertainty and life transitions in the post-treatment period encompasses the changes survivors face when attempting to re-enter their “normal” lives, Distress associated with ongoing physical problems or impairment describes issues associated with the ongoing physical sequelae, and Fear of recurrence encapsulates how the continuing threat of cancer recurrence impacted survivors. This study has found that distress is ongoing for many haematological cancer survivors in the post-treatment period. It is imperative that distress is identified and support offered to those in need to prevent further psychosocial issues. It is especially important to consider the psychosocial needs of survivors in the post-treatment stage who are discharged from the health system may be unsure where to seek help. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","acute myeloid leukemia; adult; aged; anxiety; cancer survivor; depression; female; hematologic disease; Hodgkin disease; human; male; mental stress; middle aged; multiple myeloma; nonhodgkin lymphoma; psychology; time factor; Adult; Aged; Anxiety; Cancer Survivors; Depression; Female; Hematologic Neoplasms; Hodgkin Disease; Humans; Leukemia, Myeloid, Acute; Lymphoma, Non-Hodgkin; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Stress, Psychological; Time Factors"

"Facilitating equitable prevention and management of gout for Maori in Northland, New Zealand, through a collaborative primary care approach",2019,"Introduction: The Gout Stop Programme was developed for primary care in Northland, New Zealand, to address inequitable health outcomes for Maori and Pacific people with gout. Aim: The aim of the programme was to make it easier for clinicians to prescribe urate-lowering treatment, facilitate patient adherence through education and support, and reduce barriers to gout prevention and long-term management. Methods: From 2015 to 2017, patients with acute gout who met inclusion criteria were prescribed treatment according to a 'Gout Stop Pack' option, based on renal function and diabetes status. Patients were monitored by community pharmacists. Gout educators and a Gout Kaiawhina (community support worker) provided education and support to patients and whanau (families). Patient completion of the programme and outcomes, according to target serum urate level, were recorded. Patient experience was documented using a questionnaire and rating scale. Results: In total, 160 clinicians prescribed therapy at 887 patient presentations: 71% were Maori and Pacific patients. The completion rate was 55% in this group and 84% for the non-Maori and non-Pacific group. In the Maori and Pacific group, 40% reached the target serum urate level (? 0.36 mmol L 1 ) in 91 days, and 26% required further titration. In the non-Maori/non-Pacific group, these rates were 51% and 19% respectively. Following programme completion, 68% of Maori and Pacific patients and 65% of non-Maori and non-Pacific patients continued to take allopurinol. The 21 patients interviewed rated the programme as excellent or very good. Discussion: Culturally appropriate education and support for patients and the primary care team was essential. Collaboration between prescribers, community pharmacists and support workers reduced barriers to initiating prevention and long-term urate-lowering treatment and urate testing in this high-needs gout population. ? 2019 CSIRO Publishing Journal Compilation Royal New Zealand College of General Practitioners.",""
"Atlas of group A streptococcal vaccine candidates compiled using large-scale comparative genomics",2019,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS; Streptococcus pyogenes) is a bacterial pathogen for which a commercial vaccine for humans is not available. Employing the advantages of high-throughput DNA sequencing technology to vaccine design, we have analyzed 2,083 globally sampled GAS genomes. The global GAS population structure reveals extensive genomic heterogeneity driven by homologous recombination and overlaid with high levels of accessory gene plasticity. We identified the existence of more than 290 clinically associated genomic phylogroups across 22 countries, highlighting challenges in designing vaccines of global utility. To determine vaccine candidate coverage, we investigated all of the previously described GAS candidate antigens for gene carriage and gene sequence heterogeneity. Only 15 of 28 vaccine antigen candidates were found to have both low naturally occurring sequence variation and high (>99%) coverage across this diverse GAS population. This technological platform for vaccine coverage determination is equally applicable to prospective GAS vaccine antigens identified in future studies. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Streptococcus vaccine; streptolysin O; bacterial antigen; Streptococcus vaccine; antigenic variation; Article; bacterial genome; drug design; drug determination; gene sequence; genetic heterogeneity; group A streptococcal infection; homologous recombination; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Legionella pneumophila; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; open reading frame; phenotypic plasticity; phylogenetic tree; phylogeny; population genetics; priority journal; protein function; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Streptococcus pyogenes; vaccination; bacterial genome; classification; genetic recombination; genetics; genome-wide association study; genomics; human; immunology; procedures; Streptococcus infection; Antigens, Bacterial; Genome, Bacterial; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Phylogeny; Recombination, Genetic; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcal Vaccines; Streptococcus pyogenes"
"Shortening self-report mental health symptom measures through optimal test assembly methods: Development and validation of the Patient Health Questionnaire-Depression-4",2019,"Background: The objective of this study was to develop and validate a short form of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), a self-report questionnaire for assessing depressive symptomatology, using objective criteria. Methods: Responses on the PHQ-9 were obtained from 7,850 English-speaking participants enrolled in 20 primary diagnostic test accuracy studies. PHQ unidimensionality was verified using confirmatory factor analysis, and an item response theory model was fit. Optimal test assembly (OTA) methods identified a maximally precise short form for each possible length between one and eight items, including and excluding the ninth item. The final short form was selected based on prespecified validity, reliability, and diagnostic accuracy criteria. Results: A four-item short form of the PHQ (PHQ-Dep-4) was selected. The PHQ-Dep-4 had a Cronbach's alpha of 0.805. Sensitivity and specificity of the PHQ-Dep-4 were 0.788 and 0.837, respectively, and were statistically equivalent to the PHQ-9 (sensitivity?=?0.761, specificity?=?0.866). The correlation of total scores with the full PHQ-9 was high (r?=?0.919). Conclusion: The PHQ-Dep-4 is a valid short form with minimal loss of information of scores when compared to the full-length PHQ-9. Although OTA methods have been used to shorten patient-reported outcome measures based on objective, prespecified criteria, further studies are required to validate this general procedure for broader use in health research. Furthermore, due to unexamined heterogeneity, there is a need to replicate the results of this study in different patient populations. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; Article; controlled study; depression; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; major clinical study; male; mental health research; middle aged; patient health questionnaire; patient health questionnaire depression 4; patient-reported outcome; population structure; priority journal; reliability; sensitivity and specificity; validation process; validity; depression; factor analysis; mental health; patient health questionnaire; psychology; psychometry; reproducibility; self report; standards; validation study; Depression; Depressive Disorder; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Patient Health Questionnaire; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Self Report; Sensitivity and Specificity"
"Parent’s cardiorespiratory fitness, body mass, and chronic disease status is associated with metabolic syndrome in young adults: A preliminary study",2019,"We sought to determine if there was an intergenerational association between parental weight, cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF), and disease status, with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) in their young adult offspring. Young adults (n = 270, 21 ± 1 years, 53.3% female) were assessed for MetSyn and self-reported parent’s CRF, body mass status, and disease status. MetSyn was present in 11.9% of participants, 27.4% had one or two components, and 58.5% had no components. A significantly higher percentage (93.9%) of young adults with MetSyn identified at least one parent as being overweight or obese, 84.8% reported low parental CRF and 87.9% reported a parent with disease (all p < 0.017). MetSyn in offspring is more likely when parents are perceived to have low CRF, increased body mass, and a diagnosis of disease. Evaluating the offspring of people with low CRF, elevated body mass, or who have a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or diabetes should be considered to promote early identification and treatment of young adults to reduce future premature CVD in these at-risk individuals. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Can direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs be effectively regulated?",2019,"The government of New Zealand is currently considering a new Therapeutic Products Regulatory Scheme that includes how direct-to-consumer ?advertising (DTCA) of prescription drugs should be regulated. This article reviews three different types of possible regulation of DTCA: government regulation, industry self-regulation and a mixture of the two. Recent studies demonstrate that DTC ads in the US continue to be misleading and contain minimal if any educational value, despite governmental regulatory efforts by the Food and Drug Administration. Other regulatory models are equally unsuccessful at controlling DTCA. Available evidence suggests that DTC ads are commonly misinterpreted as trusted public health messages and are more likely to affect vulnerable subgroups of New Zealanders. Taken together with the international evidence that regulation has consistently failed to prevent the inappropriate promotion of prescription medicines, these findings suggest that DTCA is more likely to cause harm than benefit and should be banned. ?

"Enhancing Outcomes of Low-Intensity Parenting Groups Through Sufficient Exemplar Training: A Randomized Control Trial",2019,"Low-intensity parenting groups, such as the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program Discussion Groups, appear to be a cost-effective intervention for child conduct problems. Several studies evaluating a Triple P Discussion Group on disobedience found promising results for improving child and parent outcomes. However, a sufficient exemplar training approach that incorporates generalization promotion strategies may assist parents to more flexibly apply positive parenting principles to a broader range of child target behaviors and settings, leading to greater change. We compared the effects of sufficient exemplar training to an existing narrowly focused low-intensity intervention. Participants were 78 families with a 5–8 year-old child. Sufficient exemplar training resulted in more robust changes in child behavior and superior outcomes for mothers on measures of parenting behavior, parenting self-efficacy, mental health, and perceptions of partner support at post-intervention and 6-month follow-up. These results indicate that teaching sufficient exemplars may promote generalization leading to enhanced intervention outcomes. ? 2018, The Author(s).","article; case report; child; child behavior; child parent relation; clinical article; female; follow up; human; human experiment; mental health; mother; randomized controlled trial; self concept; sensitivity analysis; teaching"
"Pharmacokinetics and safety of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in HCV-negative subjects with hepatic impairment",2019,"Purpose: This study characterized the effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics and safety of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir, two direct-acting antivirals used for treatment of chronic HCV infection. Methods: HCV-negative subjects with normal hepatic function, or with mild (Child-Pugh [CP]-A), moderate (CP-B), or severe (CP-C) hepatic impairment received single doses of pibrentasvir 120?mg alone or with glecaprevir 200?mg or 300?mg (n = 6/functional group/dose). Plasma pharmacokinetics and protein binding were evaluated. Doses were separated by ? 14?days of washout. Results: For the approved combination of glecaprevir 300?mg with pibrentasvir 120?mg, glecaprevir AUC was increased by 33% (CP-A), to 2.0-fold (CP-B), and to 11-fold (CP-C) relative to normal subjects; pibrentasvir AUC was ? 26% different (CP-A or CP-B) and increased to 2.1-fold (CP-C). For glecaprevir 200?mg with pibrentasvir 120?mg, glecaprevir AUC was increased by 80% (CP-A) or to 2.8-fold (CP-B), while pibrentasvir AUC was unaffected in the same subjects (? 12% difference). Pibrentasvir 120?mg alone AUC increased 51% (CP-A), 31% (CP-B), and to 5.2-fold (CP-C). The unbound fraction of glecaprevir was higher in CP-C subjects than normal subjects and pibrentasvir protein binding was similar across groups. The most common adverse event was headache; no events were serious. Conclusion: This study supported evaluation of the glecaprevir 300?mg with pibrentasvir 120-mg combination in HCV-infected subjects with CP-A hepatic impairment without dose adjustment. Elevated glecaprevir and/or pibrentasvir exposures are expected in HCV-infected patients with CP-B or CP-C hepatic impairment. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","glecaprevir; pibrentasvir; ABT-493; antivirus agent; benzimidazole derivative; pibrentasvir; quinoxaline derivative; sulfonamide; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; Child Pugh score; drug protein binding; drug safety; drug tolerability; elimination half-life; female; headache; Hepatitis C virus; human; liver cirrhosis; liver function; male; maximum plasma concentration; moderate hepatic impairment; normal human; open study; pharmacokinetic parameters; plasma protein binding; priority journal; severe hepatic impairment; side effect; single drug dose; time to maximum plasma concentration; unbound fraction; adolescent; combination drug therapy; diet therapy; drug effect; genotype; Hepacivirus; liver; liver disease; metabolism; middle aged; Adolescent; Antiviral Agents; Benzimidazoles; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Quinoxalines; Sulfonamides"

"‘It was peaceful, it was beautiful’: A qualitative study of family understandings of good end-of-life care in hospital for people dying in advanced age",2019,"Background: Hospitals are important sites of end-of-life care, particularly for older people. A need has been identified to understand best practice in hospital end-of-life care from the service-user perspective. Aim: The aim of this study was to identify examples of good care received in the hospital setting during the last 3 months of life for people dying in advanced age from the perspective of bereaved family members. Design: A social constructionist framework underpinned a qualitative research design. Data were analysed thematically drawing on an appreciative enquiry framework. Setting/participants: Interviews were conducted with 58 bereaved family carers nominated by 52 people aged >80 years participating in a longitudinal study of ageing. Data were analysed for the 21 of 34 cases where family members were ‘extremely’ or ‘very’ satisfied with a public hospital admission their older relative experienced in their last 3 months of life. Results: Participants’ accounts of good care aligned with Dewar and Nolan’s relation-centred compassionate care model: (1) a relationship based on empathy; (2) effective interactions between patients/families and staff; (3) contextualised knowledge of the patient/family; and (4) patients/families being active participants in care. We extended the model to the bicultural context of Aotearoa, New Zealand. Conclusion: We identify concrete actions that clinicians working in acute hospitals can integrate into their practice to deliver end-of-life care with which families are highly satisfied. Further research is required to support the implementation of the relation-centred compassionate care model within hospitals, with suitable adaptations for local context, and explore the subsequent impact on patients, families and staff. ?

"Hazardous Drinking Prevalence and Correlates in Older New Zealanders: A Comparison of the AUDIT-C and the CARET",2019,"Objectives: The study compared the proportion of older adults identified as drinking hazardously based on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test–Consumption (AUDIT-C) with the older adult-specific Comorbidity Alcohol Risk Evaluation Tool (CARET) and investigated whether sociodemographics, comorbidities, health, medication use, and alcohol-related risk behaviors explained discrepancies between the screens in classification of hazardousness. Method: The AUDIT-C and the CARET were administered to 3,673 adults aged 55 to 89 years. Classification agreement between the screens was evaluated using Cohen’s kappa. Hazardous drinking groups were compared using logistic regression. Results: Analysis indicated moderate agreement between the screens. Drinkers classified as “hazardous on the CARET only” consumed less alcohol, but were more likely to drink-drive. Introducing a drink-driving criterion into the calculation of hazardousness on the AUDIT-C substantially decreased the classification discrepancy between the measures. Discussion: Standard screening can be improved by investigating comorbidities, medication use, and alcohol-related risk behaviors in those initially identified as nonhazardous drinkers. ?

"Gr1int/high Cells Dominate the Early Phagocyte Response to Mycobacterial Lung Infection in Mice",2019,"Lung infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is characterized by chronic infection of lung-resident macrophages, long considered to be the primary hosts and determinants of the outcome of the early immune response. Although alveolar macrophages are well-known to host intracellular mycobacteria at later stages of disease, little is known about the earliest events of the innate immune response. The phagocytes that take up mycobacteria immediately following infection, and how the early lung phagocyte response is altered by vaccination with M. bovis bacille Calmette-Gu?rin (BCG) were unknown. Using BCG expressing the bright red fluorescent protein tdTomato and flow cytometry, we modeled early infection in C57BL/6 mice and tracked phagocyte population kinetics and uptake of mycobacteria, to better understand the involvement of specific phagocyte subsets. By 1 day post-infection, dose-dependent accumulation of neutrophils was observed and surprisingly, granulocytes comprised a greater proportion of infected phagocytes than alveolar macrophages. By 7 days post-infection alveolar macrophages had become the dominant BCG-associated phagocytes. Prior mucosal BCG exposure provided immunized mice with greater frequencies and numbers of lung macrophage subsets, and a significantly greater proportion of alveolar macrophages expressed CD11b prior to and following challenge infection. These data provide the first evidence of granulocytes as the dominant infected phagocyte subset early after mycobacterial infection, and highlight enhanced recruitment of lung macrophages as a factor associated with protection in BCG-immunized mice. ? 2019 Ryder, Sandford, Manners, Dalton, Wiles and Kirman.

"Blunted cardiac AMPK response is associated with susceptibility to ischemia/ reperfusion in Male offspring of gestational diabetic rats",2019,"Background/Aims: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is closely associated with early perinatal complications and long-term health problems, such as cardiovascular disease, in offspring. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is cardioprotective, particularly in the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R). However, whether GDM programs offspring susceptibility to cardiac I/R and the involvement of AMPK remain unclear. Methods: Streptozotocin was administered to rats during mid pregnancy; the postpartum maternal metabolome was assessed by chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Male offspring were subjected to body composition scanning followed by ex vivo global I/R. Cardiac signaling was determined by Western blotting. Results: The body weights (BWs) of the GDM male offspring were significantly heavier than those of the control group from the age of 8 weeks; the heart weights (HWs) and HW/BW were also increased in the GDM group compared to the control group. The ex vivo post-I/R cardiac contractile function recovery was significantly compromised in the GDM male offspring. The phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC was elevated by ex vivo I/R in both groups, but to a significantly lesser extent in the GDM group. Conclusion: GDM male offspring rats have higher risks of overgrowth and intolerance to cardiac I/R, which may be due to a compromised AMPK signaling pathway. ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Mitochondrial lysine deacetylation promotes energy metabolism and calcium signaling in insulin-secreting cells",2019,"In pancreatic b-cells, mitochondria generate signals that promote insulin granule exocytosis. Here we study how lysine acetylation of mitochondrial proteins mechanistically affects metabolism-secretion coupling in insulin-secreting cells. Using mass spectrometry–based proteomics, we identified lysine acetylation sites in rat insulinoma cell line clone 1E cells. In cells lacking the mitochondrial lysine deacetylase sirtuin-3 (SIRT3), several matrix proteins are hyperacetylated. Disruption of the SIRT3 gene has a deleterious effect on mitochondrial energy metabolism and Ca2+ signaling. Under resting conditions, SIRT3 deficient cells are overactivated, which elevates the respiratory rate and enhances calcium signaling and basal insulin secretion. In response to glucose, the SIRT3 knockout cells are unable to mount a sustained cytosolic ATP response. Calcium signaling is strongly reduced and the respiratory response as well as insulin secretion are blunted. We propose mitochondrial protein lysine acetylation as a control mechanism in b-cell energy metabolism and Ca2+ signaling. ?

"The activity of peptides of the calcitonin family in bone",2019,"Calcitonin was discovered over 50 yr ago as a new hormone that rapidly lowers circulating calcium levels. This effect is caused by the inhibition of calcium efflux from bone, as calcitonin is a potent inhibitor of bone resorption. Calcitonin has been in clinical use for conditions of accelerated bone turnover, including Paget’s disease and osteoporosis; although in recent years, with the development of drugs that are more potent inhibitors of bone resorption, its use has declined. A number of peptides that are structurally similar to calcitonin form the calcitonin family, which currently includes calcitonin gene–related peptides (αCGRP and βCGRP), amylin, adrenomedullin, and intermedin. Apart from being structurally similar, the peptides signal through related receptors and have some overlapping biological activities, although other activities are peptide specific. In bone, in vitro studies and administration of the peptides to animals generally found inhibitory effects on osteoclasts and bone resorption and positive effects on osteoblasts and bone formation. Surprisingly, studies in genetically modified mice have demonstrated that the physiological role of calcitonin appears to be the inhibition of osteoblast activity and bone turnover, whereas amylin inhibits osteoclast activity. The review article focuses on the activities of peptides of the calcitonin family in bone and the challenges in understanding the relationship between the pharmacological effects and the physiological roles of these peptides. ? 2019, American Physiological Society.

"The sinonasal mycobiota in chronic rhinosinusitis and control patients",2019,"Background: While bacterial associations with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) are increasingly well described, fewer studies have examined the fungal component of the sinonasal microbiota. Here we present a study of the sinonasal mycobiota in a cohort of 144 patients (106 patients with CRS and 38 controls). Methodology: Fungal communities were characterised by analysis of mucosal swab samples of the left and right middle meatuses via ITS2 marker amplicon sequencing on the Illumina MiSeq platform. Fungal associations with previously published bacterial community and inflammatory cytokine and cell data for this cohort (collected at the same intra-operative time point) were also investigated. Results: Malassezia spp. were ubiquitous and often highly predominant. Season of sampling explained more of the variability in the data than any of the clinical parameters. The predominant Malassezia sp. was distinct in patients with cystic fibrosis compareto those without. However, distinctions in the mycobiota were not evident between any other patient groupings assessed, and few fungal-bacterial or fungal-inflammatory associations were observed. Conclusions: This study confirms the prominent place of Malassezia spp. within the upper respiratory tract. Overall, few distinctions between patient groups were evident, and these data lend further support to the hypothesis that fungal community types may have no direct causative association with idiopathic CRS. Additional studies incorporating a broader array of inflammatory markers are required to assess whether these ubiquitous fungi nonetheless play an exacerbating role in some sensitive individuals. ? 2019, International Rhinologic Society.

"Mental health service users' progression from illicit drug use to schizophrenia in New Zealand",2019,"Background: Recently, publications have hypothesised that the demonstrated increase in the incidence of schizophrenia in New Zealand is a side effect of the increased strength of available cannabis derivatives over the last 25+ years and the much more recent increase in the population's use of methamphetamine. Aim: To compare the rates of later schizophrenia between age-matched mental health service users with initial diagnoses as alcohol abusers or illicit drug users. Method: From the PRIMHD comprehensive national database, all users of the mental health services over a 5-year period who received an ICD-10 presenting diagnosis of alcohol or substance use/abuse were identified. For each person identified, the database was examined for the following 3 years to determine the numbers later diagnosed with schizophrenia. Results: For the initial alcohol problem people in their twenties, 1.7% were diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia in the subsequent 3 years. For the initial drug problem people, the rate was 10.9%. Within that drug-using population, the indigenous Maori developed schizophrenia at a higher rate than did the remainder of the population. Conclusion: These findings in New Zealand require further research into their generalisability, context and explanation. ? 2019 Author(s).",""
"Auditory Streaming and Prediction in Tinnitus Sufferers",2019,"Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether auditory streaming (segregation of incoming sounds into separate sound sources) and the ability to anticipate future auditory events are affected in tinnitus sufferers compared with nontinnitus controls with matched levels of hearing. It was hypothesized that tinnitus would result in abnormal electroencephalography responses to tone deviants and tone omissions compared to controls for frequencies near the pitch of tinnitus, and this should correspond with increased levels of cortical γ and θ oscillatory rhythms. Design: Sixteen individuals with tinnitus (10 men and 6 women; age, 53.44; SD, 12.92 years) and 14 control participants (8 men and 6 women; age, 50.25; SD, 18.54 years) took part in the study. A modified version of the ABA streaming paradigm, with repeating triplet pattern of two frequencies (A and B) presented as A-B-A, was used to examine deviant-related prediction error. Omission-related prediction errors were examined using a modified version of a tone-omission paradigm. Regions of interest were frontocentral, left frontal, right frontal, and temporal lobes. Results: A larger N1c waveform was elicited in the absence of any tone deviation within the left primary auditory cortex of tinnitus participants. No differences were present between groups for omissions. The only difference in oscillatory band activity between the two groups in this study was in response to tones 7 semitones different from tinnitus pitch, with significantly lower β-2 band activity present for the tinnitus group, correlating most with activity within the right inferior occipital gyrus. Conclusions: The findings from this study imply that cortical-level auditory stream segregation is altered among individuals with tinnitus. ? Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Migrants and disability following injury: findings from a prospective study in New Zealand",2019,"Objectives: To compare the prevalence of disability between migrants and non-migrants at three and 24 months post-injury, and to identify key predictors of post-injury disability among migrants. Methods: Disability among 2,850 injured participants, including 677 migrants to New Zealand, was measured prospectively using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule. Results: Migrants experienced higher risk of disability than non-migrants at three months post-injury (aRR=1.14, 95%CI 1.03–1.26). Both groups had similar disability prevalence, but higher than pre-injury, at 24 months. For migrants, strong predictors of disability at three months post-injury were: higher injury severity, pre-injury obesity, and perceiving the injury as a threat of disability. Having multiple chronic conditions was a predictor of disability at both time points. Conclusions: Disability was persistent for migrants and non-migrants to 24 months post-injury. The disability risk at three months was higher for migrants. Certain predictors associated with disability were identified. Implications for public health: Despite having accessed healthcare services for their injury, migrants (compared with non-migrants) had higher risks of disability at least in the first three months post-injury. Interventions should be focused during this critical period on identified key predictors to promote faster recovery and reduce disability. ? 2019 The Authors","adult; disability; disabled person; ethnology; female; hospitalization; human; injury; injury scale; male; middle aged; migration; New Zealand; Oceanic ancestry group; outcome assessment; prevalence; prospective study; psychology; quality of life; time factor; Adult; Disability Evaluation; Disabled Persons; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Time Factors; Transients and Migrants; Wounds and Injuries"
"Medical student wellbeing - A consensus statement from Australia and New Zealand",2019,"Background: Medical student wellbeing - a consensus statement from Australia and New Zealand outlines recommendations for optimising medical student wellbeing within medical schools in our region. Worldwide, medical schools have responsibilities to respond to concerns about student psychological, social and physical wellbeing, but guidance for medical schools is limited. To address this gap, this statement clarifies key concepts and issues related to wellbeing and provides recommendations for educational program design to promote both learning and student wellbeing. The recommendations focus on student selection; learning, teaching and assessment; learning environment; and staff development. Examples of educational initiatives from the evidence-base are provided, emphasising proactive and preventive approaches to student wellbeing. Main recommendations: The consensus statement provides specific recommendations for medical schools to consider at all stages of program design and implementation. These are: Design curricula that promote peer support and progressive levels of challenge to students. Employ strategies to promote positive outcomes from stress and to help others in need. Design assessment tasks to foster wellbeing as well as learning. Provide mental health promotion and suicide prevention initiatives. Provide physical health promotion initiatives. Ensure safe and health-promoting cultures for learning in on-campus and clinical settings. Train staff on student wellbeing and how to manage wellbeing concerns. Conclusion: A broad integrated approach to improving student wellbeing within medical school programs is recommended. Medical schools should work cooperatively with student and trainee groups, and partner with clinical services and other training bodies to foster safe practices and cultures. Initiatives should aim to assist students to develop adaptive responses to stressful situations so that graduates are prepared for the realities of the workplace. Multi-institutional, longitudinal collaborative research in Australia and New Zealand is needed to close critical gaps in the evidence needed by medical schools in our region. ? 2019 The Author(s).",""
"The role of macrophages during acute kidney injury: destruction and repair",2019,"Acute kidney injury (AKI) is defined by a rapid decline in renal function. Regardless of the initial cause of injury, the influx of immune cells is a common theme during AKI. While an inflammatory response is critical for the initial control of injury, a prolonged response can negatively affect tissue repair. In this review, we focus on the role of macrophages, from early inflammation to resolution, during AKI. These cells serve as the innate defense system by phagocytosing cellular debris and pathogenic molecules and bridge communication with the adaptive immune system by acting as antigen-presenting cells and secreting cytokines. While many immune cells function to initiate inflammation, macrophages play a complex role throughout AKI. This complexity is driven by their functional plasticity: the ability to polarize from a “pro-inflammatory” phenotype to a “pro-reparative” phenotype. Importantly, experimental and translational studies indicate that macrophage polarization opens the possibility to generate novel therapeutics to promote repair during AKI. A thorough understanding of the biological roles these phagocytes play during both injury and repair is necessary to understand the limitations while furthering the therapeutic application. ? 2018, IPNA.","acute kidney failure; adaptive immunity; antigen presentation; cell polarity; cytokine release; disease model; human; innate immunity; intracellular signaling; macrophage; macrophage function; macrophage polarization; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; tissue repair; zebra fish"

"Structure-activity relationships of wollamide cyclic hexapeptides with activity against drug-resistant and intracellular mycobacterium tuberculosis",2019,"Wollamides are cyclic hexapeptides, recently isolated from an Australian soil Streptomyces isolate, that exhibit promising in vitro antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium bovis Bacille Calmette Gu?rin without displaying cytotoxicity against a panel of mammalian cells. Here, we report the synthesis and antimycobacterial activity of 36 new synthetic wollamides, collated with all known synthetic and natural wollamides, to reveal structure characteristics responsible for in vitro growth-inhibitory activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv, H37Ra, CDC1551, HN878, and HN353). The most potent antimycobacterial wollamides were those where residue VI D-Orn (wollamide B) was replaced by D-Arg (wollamide B1) or D-Lys (wollamide B2), with all activity being lost when residue VI was replaced by Gly, L-Arg, or L-Lys (wollamide B3). Substitution of other amino acid residues mainly reduced or ablated antimycobacterial activity. Significantly, whereas wollamide B2 was the most potent in restricting M. tuberculosis in vitro, wollamide B1 restricted M. tuberculosis intracellular burden in infected macrophages. Wollamide B1 synergized with pretomanid (PA-824) in inhibiting M. tuberculosis in vitro growth but did not antagonize prominent first- and second-line tuberculosis antibiotics. Furthermore, wollamide B1 exerted bactericidal activity against nonreplicating M. tuberculosis and impaired growth of multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant clinical isolates. In vivo pharmacokinetic profiles for wollamide B1 in rats and mice encourage further optimization of the wollamide pharmacophore for in vivo bioavailability. Collectively, these observations highlight the potential of the wollamide antimycobacterial pharmacophore. Copyright ? 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

"Should antenatal corticosteroids be considered in women with gestational diabetes before planned late gestation caesarean section",2019,"Babies born to mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at a greater risk of developing respiratory complications and hypoglycaemia than those born to mothers without diabetes. However, there is currently insufficient evidence as to whether these risks are altered by antenatal corticosteroids after 37?weeks gestation. This retrospective study suggests that antenatal corticosteroids probably reduce respiratory admissions to the newborn intensive care unit with a mild increase in neonatal hypoglycaemia in women with GDM who deliver via caesarean section after 37?weeks gestation. Consequently, we recommend a randomised, controlled trial is required to determine the efficacy and safety of antenatal corticosteroids specifically in women with GDM. ? 2019 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists","betamethasone; glucose; insulin; adult; Article; cesarean section; clinical article; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; human; hypoglycemia; neonatal respiratory distress syndrome; newborn; newborn intensive care; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; prenatal period; priority journal; retrospective study; transient tachypnea of the newborn"
"Legitimate participation of medical students in community attachments",2019,"Introduction: Social theories of learning consider learning and thinking as social activities. These activities may occur within a community of practice. Communities of practice may position learners as legitimate peripheral participants. This study tests whether legitimate peripheral participation provides an overarching theory to assist in evaluating learning and teaching of medical students undertaking short primary care attachments. Methods: A questionnaire was delivered to all Year 4 students at the University of Auckland in 2015. A deductive content analysis was undertaken on the data utilising a categorisation matrix. Legitimate peripheral participation theory was used to develop the categorisation matrix. Results: Three broad themes explained legitimate peripheral participation by medical students undertaking a short primary care attachment. These three themes were ‘hospitality,’ ‘collegiality’ and ‘responsibility.’ Conclusion: Legitimate peripheral participation, in the context of undergraduate primary health care attachments, appears to depend upon positive social activities between students and health professionals and patients. Using legitimate peripheral participation as a theory to underpin evaluations of general practice attachments it is possible to determine improvements in the learning and teaching experience of medical students. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; article; case report; clinical article; content analysis; female; general practice; human; learning; male; medical education; medical student; primary health care; questionnaire; responsibility; social behavior; theoretical study; cultural anthropology; education; general practitioner; medical education; medical student; New Zealand; procedures; psychology; Culture; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Humans; Learning; New Zealand; Physicians, Primary Care; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Unstable behavior of segmental ring under various pressures and its discrete element simulation",2019,"In February 2012, a serious accident which resulted in five fatalities happened during a TBM-tunnel construction under the seabed in Japan. The cause of the accident appeared to be due to the Key-segment slipping out of the segment ring by the thrusting tailskin (wire brushes) of the TBM into the segment ring. This resulted in the collapse of the rings, causing the seabed ground and seawater to flow into the tunnel. We investigated how thin and thick segments without any circumferential joints behave under isotropic and anisotropic pressures using small-scale physical model. In the model tests, pressures were applied to the surroundings of the segment rings and the strains at each segment were measured in order to evaluate the damage. In addition, cases where lubrication on the contact area between the K-and B-segments was present or not were investigated and their discrete element simulations were also conducted. ?

"Equality, efficiency and effectiveness: going beyond RCTs in A. L. Cochrane's vision of health care",2019,"A. L. Cochrane's Effectiveness and Efficiency frequently appears as a key reference in debates over, and a justification for, contemporary evidence-based medicine. Cochrane's concern in this text with the equality of care as the ultimate rationale for why effectiveness and efficiency of cure are needed has, however, largely disappeared from debate. In this article, we reconsider Cochrane's approach through the use of case studies of plural forms of medicine in the Czech Republic, namely traditional Chinese medicine, homeopathy and spa care. In addition to bringing equality back into the picture, we also identify four expansions to Cochrane's original vision arising from the difficulties of separating cure from care; the overlap between prevention and cure; the complex actions of some multi-faceted therapies; and recent reconceptualisations of the placebo effect. In conclusion, we suggest that instead of the widely used strictly vertical “evidence pyramid”, a descriptor of the horizontal and additive ordering of evidence might be more appropriate. We also argue that in healthcare systems characterised by a multiplicity of approaches, if we want to truly benefit from this heterogeneity, we must take seriously each medical tradition's approaches to prevention, cure, care, as well as efficiency, efficacy and equality. ? 2018 Foundation for the Sociology of Health & Illness","alternative medicine; article; Chinese medicine; Czech Republic; ethnography; health care policy; homeopathy; human; placebo effect; systematic review; vision; Chinese medicine; cultural anthropology; Czech Republic; evidence based medicine; homeopathy; Anthropology, Cultural; Czech Republic; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Policy; Homeopathy; Humans; Medicine, Chinese Traditional"
"The geographic harmonisation of Scotland's small area census data, 1981 to 2011",2019,"Previous research in Scotland used a merging approach to combine census boundary data for geographies specific to 1981, 1991 and 2001 to create Consistent Areas Through Time (CATTs) for the analysis of health and social data for small areas. In this paper, we adopt the same methodology to integrate the 2011 Scottish Output Areas to the CATTs. First, we overlaid the 2001 Output Areas upon the 2011 Output Areas to create SUPER OAs, which were then combined with SUPER EDs, which represented a consistent small area geography for 1981 and 1991. This resulted in 8,548 CATTs providing a consistent geography for the 1981, 1991, 2001 and 2011 Censuses in Scotland. We demonstrate the utility of the CATTs by exploring the correlations between deprivation, the proportion of the population who were permanently sick and those with degree qualifications, across the 4 censuses, a research angle impossible without consistent geographies. We have provided a resource that enables users to deepen their understanding of small area social changes in Scotland between the 1981 and 2011 Censuses. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","census; social change; article; geography; human; population research; Scotland; social change; Scotland; United Kingdom"
"Rugby Fans in Training New Zealand (RUFIT-NZ): A pilot randomized controlled trial of a healthy lifestyle program for overweight men delivered through professional rugby clubs in New Zealand",2019,"Background: Healthy lifestyle programs that are designed specifically to appeal to and support men to improve lifestyle behaviors and lose weight are needed. The Rugby Fans in Training-New Zealand (RUFIT-NZ) program is delivered by professional rugby clubs and inspired by the successful Football Fans In Training program (FFIT), a gender sensitized weight loss program for obese middle-aged men delivered by professional football clubs in Scotland. RUFIT-NZ required development and evaluation for feasibility. Methods: To develop the intervention we reviewed content from the FFIT program and evidence-based physical activity, dietary and weight management guidelines, and undertook a series of focus groups and key informant interviews. We then evaluated the feasibility of the intervention in a two-arm, parallel, pilot randomized controlled trial in New Zealand. Ninety-six participants were randomized to either the 12-week RUFIT-NZ intervention (N = 49) or a control group (N = 47). The intervention was delivered through professional rugby clubs and involved physical activity training and classroom sessions on healthy lifestyle behaviors. Pilot trial outcomes included body weight, heart rate, blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, and lifestyle behaviors. Feasibility was assessed by recruitment and retention rates, and acceptability of the intervention. Results: At 12 weeks the mean difference in body weight was 2.5 kg (95% CI -0.4 to 5.4), which favored the intervention. Statistically significant differences in favor of the intervention group were also observed for waist circumference, resting heart rate, diastolic blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, and the proportion of participants that were adherent to 3 or more healthy lifestyle behaviors. The intervention was considered feasible to test in a full trial given the good recruitment and retention rates, and positive feedback from participants. Conclusions: A pilot study of a healthy lifestyle intervention delivered via professional rugby clubs in New Zealand demonstrated positive effects on weight and physiological outcomes, as well as adherence to lifestyle behaviors. Feasibility issues in terms of recruitment, retention, and participant acceptability were assessed and findings will be used to inform the design of a definitive trial.

"New Zealand childhood ocular trauma study: Analysis of 75 601 cases of ocular injury from 2007 to 2016",2019,"Importance: Childhood ocular injury is a common, preventable cause of potentially severe permanent disability. Background: This study evaluates the nationwide incidence, demographics and visual outcomes of children with ocular injury in New Zealand. Design: Nationwide retrospective review. Participants: All children in New Zealand aged 0 to 17 years from 2007 to 2016 with ocular injury requiring assessment by a medical practitioner. Methods: New Zealand national and regional datasets were used to evaluate population-level statistics for ocular injury over a 10-year period. Visual and clinical outcome data were assessed using a randomized sample of 150 patients. Main Outcome Measures: Annual incidence, aetiology, demographics, injury location, visual outcomes, protective eyewear use, surgical intervention and follow-up. Results: A national total of 75 601 cases were included with a mean incidence of 719/100 000 children/year. Cases were predominantly male (63.2%) and of New Zealand-European ethnicity (60.8%), aged 0 to 4 years (30.66%). Injury cause was most commonly “struck by object” (53.7%) and occurred in the home (50.9%). Tertiary hospital assessment and treatment was required in 17.7% where final visual acuity of 6/12 or worse was noted in 19.7% and protective eyewear use was reported in 2.7%. Maori and Pacific ethnicities were associated with higher rates of permanent visual impairment. Conclusions and Relevance: Children with the highest risk of ocular injury are males aged 0 to 4 years. Children of Maori or Pacific Island ethnicity and aged 15 to 17 years have the highest risk of ocular injury resulting in permanent visual impairment. Protective eyewear use is uncommon in children presenting with ocular injury.

"Patent Foramen Ovale Closure Versus Medical Therapy for Cryptogenic Stroke: Meta-Analysis of Randomised Trials",2019,"Background: Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a common anatomic variant associated with cryptogenic stroke. Percutaneous PFO closure in these patients to prevent recurrent neurological events has been controversial for decades, and mixed results have been reported from past and recent observational and randomised studies. This meta-analysis of randomised trials aims to compare the efficacy and safety of PFO closure with medical therapy for cryptogenic stroke patients. Methods: Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus and Cochrane were searched from January 1980 to September 2017 by two authors independently to include original randomised trials comparing PFO closure with medical therapy for secondary stroke prevention. Relevant study and baseline characteristics and outcomes were extracted and pooled using random-effects models. Results: Amongst 619 articles searched giving 10 full-texts assessed, six studies reporting five randomised trials and totalling 1,829 PFO closure and 1,611 medical therapy patients were included. Pooled hazards ratios (95% confidence interval, p-value) ischaemic stroke, transient ischaemic attack (TIA) and composite neurovascular or mortality events were 0.41 (0.19–0.90, p = 0.03), 0.77 (0.51–1.14, p = 0.19) and 0.60 (0.44–0.81, p < 0.001) for PFO closure compared to medical therapy. Any adverse events, major bleeding and all-cause mortality were similar between modalities (p = 0.37–0.95), however PFO closure had higher rates of new onset atrial fibrillation at 4.6 times (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis found that, in patients with cryptogenic stroke, percutaneous PFO closure is beneficial at reducing ischaemic stroke and composite neurovascular or mortality events, with a higher incidence of new atrial fibrillation, compared to medical therapy. ? 2018 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)","acetylsalicylic acid; antithrombocytic agent; clopidogrel; dipyridamole; ticlopidine; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; Article; artificial embolization; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; human; intermethod comparison; meta analysis; mortality; patent foramen ovale; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; transient ischemic attack; cerebrovascular accident; complication; fibrinolytic therapy; global health; heart catheterization; incidence; patent foramen ovale; procedures; recurrent disease; secondary prevention; septal occluder; survival rate; trends; Anticoagulants; Cardiac Catheterization; Foramen Ovale, Patent; Global Health; Humans; Incidence; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Recurrence; Secondary Prevention; Septal Occluder Device; Stroke; Survival Rate; Thrombolytic Therapy"
"Factors associated with the identification of child mental health problems in primary care—a systematic review",2019,"Background: Although common and often with long-lasting effects, child mental health problems (MHPs) are still under-recognized and under-treated.

Objectives: To review studies on factors associated with the identification of child MHPs in primary care. Methods: Six leading databases were systematically searched until 1 October 2018. Two independent researchers selected articles and extracted data on study characteristics and factors associated with MHP identification. Inclusion criteria were the investigation of factors associated with MHP identification by primary care professionals (PCPs) in children aged 0–18 years. Results: Of the 6215 articles identified, 26 were included. Prevalence rates of PCP-identified MHPs varied between 7 and 30%. PCPs identified 26–60% of children with an increased risk of MHPs as indicated by MHP assessment tools, but associated factors were investigated in relatively few studies. MHPs were more often identified in children with a family composition other than married parents, with worse mental health symptoms, prior MHPs, among boys in elementary school, when contact with PCPs was related to parental psychosocial concerns or routine health check-ups, when PCPs were recently trained in MHPs or when PCPs felt less burdened treating MHPs. Conclusion: MHP identification varied substantially between studies and PCPs and was related to several child, family and practice factors. Future studies should systematically investigate factors associated with MHP identification by PCPs and specifically in children with an increased risk of MHPs according to mental health assessment tools. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Risk of Mortality and Hospitalization After Post-Pancreatitis Diabetes Mellitus vs Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Population-Based Matched Cohort Study",2019,"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the risk of mortality and hospitalization in individuals with post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PPDM) compared with those with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: Using nationwide hospital discharge data on pancreatitis and diabetes in New Zealand (n = 231,943), a total of 959 individuals with PPDM were identified. For each individual with PPDM, 10 age- and sex-matched individuals with T2DM were randomly selected. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was conducted, and the risk was expressed as hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: A total of 3,867 deaths occurred among 10,549 study individuals. Individuals with PPDM had all-cause mortality rate at 80.5 (95% CI, 70.3-90.6) per 1,000 person-years, which was higher compared with T2DM individuals (adjusted HR, 1.13 (95% CI, 1.00-1.29); absolute excess risk, 14.8 (95% CI, 4.5-25.2) per 1,000 person-years). Compared with T2DM, PPDM was associated with higher risks of mortality from cancer (adjusted HR, 1.44; 95% CI, 1.13-1.83), infectious disease (adjusted HR, 2.52; 95% CI, 1.69-3.77), and gastrointestinal disease (adjusted HR, 2.56; 95% CI, 1.64-4.01). Individuals with PPDM vs T2DM were also at significantly higher risks of hospitalization for chronic pulmonary disease, moderate to severe renal disease, and infectious disease. CONCLUSIONS: Individuals with PPDM have higher risk of mortality and hospitalization compared with individuals with T2DM. Guidelines for management of PPDM need to be developed with a view to preventing excess deaths and hospitalizations in individuals with PPDM.","aged; cohort analysis; comparative study; complication; confidence interval; diabetes mellitus; epidemiology; female; hospitalization; human; male; middle aged; mortality; New Zealand; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pancreatitis; procedures; proportional hazards model; randomization; risk assessment; Aged; Cohort Studies; Confidence Intervals; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; New Zealand; Pancreatitis; Proportional Hazards Models; Random Allocation; Risk Assessment"
"Greater insulin response to acute fructose ingestion among M?ori and Pacific people compared to European people living in Aotearoa New Zealand",2019,"Background: Fructose consumption has been linked with insulin resistance, obesity and diabetes, which are more prevalent in those of M?ori or Pacific ethnicity compared to New Zealand European. Aim: To determine whether the acute effects of fructose consumption on serum glucose, insulin, lipids and C-reactive protein differs according to body mass index (BMI) and/or ethnicity. Methods: Participants of M?ori (n = 25), Pacific (n = 26) or New Zealand European (n = 25) ethnicity consumed a 64 g fructose/16 g glucose solution. Changes in lipids, glucose, insulin and C-reactive protein were analysed using mixed models for repeated measures. Results: After adjustment for age and gender, those with higher BMI had a higher glucose (P = 0.0064) and insulin (P = 0.0007) response than those with lower BMI. Those of M?ori or Pacific ethnicity had similar glucose levels (P = 0.077) to those of New Zealand European ethnicity but higher insulin responses (P = 0.0005), which remained after additional adjustment for BMI (P = 0.001). Reported sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB) intake was higher among M?ori and Pacific than New Zealand European (median 1.0 vs 0.0 SSB/day P = 0.002). Conclusion: Even after adjustment for BMI, those of M?ori and Pacific ethnicity have a significantly higher insulin response to fructose than New Zealand Europeans. Higher habitual SSB intake may be a contributing factor. ? 2018 Royal Australasian College of Physicians","C reactive protein; fructose; glucose; insulin; C reactive protein; fructose; insulin; adult; Article; body mass; cohort analysis; controlled study; dietary intake; female; human; human experiment; insulin response; male; Maori (people); New Zealand; normal human; Pacific Islander; physical examination; priority journal; questionnaire; sugar-sweetened beverage; adolescent; aged; blood; Caucasian; comparative study; eating; ethnology; Europe; glucose blood level; insulin resistance; middle aged; Oceanic ancestry group; Pacific islands; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Blood Glucose; Body Mass Index; C-Reactive Protein; Eating; Europe; European Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Fructose; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Pacific Islands; Sugar-Sweetened Beverages; Young Adult"
"Elevated cerebrospinal fluid sodium and chloride levels in a saltwater drowning death",2019,"To ascribe a cause of death from drowning in a body immersed in water can be difficult because of the absence of specific postmortem findings and unreliable ancillary tests. Postmortem vitreous biochemical analysis is documented to be a useful adjunct ancillary test to aid the diagnosis of saltwater drowning. A major confounding factor in using postmortem vitreous is the effect of electrolyte diffusion and water osmosis during immersion. A recent animal study suggested that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biochemical analysis, which is unaffected by immersion, may be an alternative. However, to date, there are no human data to support this. We report a saltwater drowning death from presumed suicide in which the postmortem CSF sodium and chloride level was elevated compared with nonimmersion deaths. This case gives evidence to support the potential use of postmortem CSF sodium and chloride level as an adjunct to the diagnosis of saltwater drowning. ? Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Don't go there – It's not a nice place: Older adults’ experiences of delirium",2019,"Delirium is a common neuropsychiatric disorder that causes fluctuations in consciousness and attention, impairments in cognitive functioning and information processing, and changes in how individuals perceive what is going on around them. Delirium is associated with increased mortality, ongoing impairment in cognitive functioning, and a high possibility of discharge to residential care. The experience of delirium may be distressing for the patient and their family. Despite the frequency of delirium in hospitalized elderly patients, there is a dearth of literature that examines their experience of this phenomenon, and how it affects individuals as they continue their lives. This study uses descriptive qualitative methodology to explore the question: ‘What is the experience of delirium for older adults during hospitalisation?’ Data were collected from older adults who had received hospital care in a tertiary general hospital setting. Seven participants were recruited between January and June 2017. Semi-structured individual interviews were used to gather data which was analysed using content analysis. Four themes were identified. These were sense of confusion, disrupted sense of autonomy, perceptual disturbances, and emotional response. Participants exercised agency in the way they responded to these experiences. The study highlighted the need for delirium prevention, and education to improve nurses’ recognition, understanding, and management of delirium. In particular, there is a need for nurses to attend to the psychological and emotional experience of delirium. ? 2018 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.","aged; confusion; delirium; emotion; female; human; interview; male; middle aged; personal autonomy; psychology; sensory dysfunction; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Confusion; Delirium; Emotions; Female; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Personal Autonomy; Sensation Disorders"
"Pornography addiction and the perimeters of acceptable pornography viewing",2019,"In this study, we investigate how pornography addiction is constructed by members of the New Zealand public by analysing six 2016 newspaper articles focusing on pornography addiction, and the 1430 Facebook comments posted in response to them. Utilizing a critical discursive approach, we identified five interpretative repertoires employed to construct both the viewing of pornography and pornography itself in multiple ways. Our analysis suggests that although pornography remained poorly defined, it was at turns framed as both unnatural and natural to view. The naturalness of viewing pornography however was complicated by an explicit acceptance of pornography addiction, which was variously proposed as being similar to substance abuse, a threat to intimate relationships, and as a convenient excuse. Moreover, the pornography addict was reliably described as male, and implicitly placed within a monogamous heterosexual relationship, with pornography depicted as most threatening when impinging upon such relationships. As such, we argue that the construction of pornography addiction not only reifies morally conservative historical concerns, but also side-lines the ethical and political ramifications of normalized pornography viewership. The possible replacement of discussions about the content of pornography with debates about user effects indicates a rapid historical shift from concerns for community standards to concerns for personal responsibility. ?

"Eating disorder symptoms across the weight spectrum in Australian adolescents",2019,"Objective: Despite known associations between eating disorders and obesity, little is known about the current prevalence of symptoms of eating disorders across the weight spectrum. This study therefore aimed to estimate the population prevalence of eating disorder symptoms in relation to weight status in adolescents. Method: The sample comprised 3,270 participants (14–15 years; 52% boys) drawn from Wave 6 of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Symptoms of anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) were assessed using self-report on the Branched Eating Disorder Test. This measure identifies clinically significant symptoms in the past 3 months according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition. Using study-derived cross-sectional population weights, the prevalence of each symptom was estimated for the total population and by sex and weight status. Results: The estimated population prevalence was high (14.3–25.7%) for body image symptoms such as fear of weight gain and overvaluation of body weight but lower (0.5–3.7%) for behavioral symptoms such as binge eating and compensatory behaviors. Symptoms were more prevalent among adolescents with overweight or obesity. Although most symptoms tended to have higher prevalence among girls than boys, boys with obesity had higher prevalence of binge eating and excessive exercise than girls with obesity. The overall estimated population prevalence for AN and BN was 0.20% and 0.10%, respectively. Discussion: The study highlights a need for clinicians to be cognizant of disordered eating behaviors regardless of weight status and has implications for both eating disorder and obesity prevention and intervention. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adolescent; adolescent obesity; age distribution; anorexia nervosa; Article; Australian; binge eating disorder; body image; body weight gain; Branched Eating Disorder Test; bulimia; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease classification; DSM-5; exercise; fear; female; human; major clinical study; male; population research; prevalence; priority journal; self report; sex difference; symptomatology; anorexia nervosa; Australia; binge eating disorder; body weight; bulimia; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; feeding behavior; longitudinal study; obesity; psychology; sex factor; Adolescent; Anorexia Nervosa; Australia; Binge-Eating Disorder; Body Image; Body Weight; Bulimia Nervosa; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Obesity; Overweight; Prevalence; Self Report; Sex Factors"
"Association between Dry Eye Disease and Migraine Headaches in a Large Population-Based Study",2019,"Importance: Reports in the literature have conflicting findings about an association between dry eye disease (DED) and migraine headaches. Objective: To determine the strength of the association between DED and migraine headaches. Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective case-control study included 72969 patients older than 18 years from University of North Carolina-affiliated health care facilities from May 1, 2008, through May 31, 2018. Deidentified aggregate patient data were queried; data were analyzed from June 1 through June 30, 2018. Exposures: Diagnosis of migraine headache. Main Outcomes and Measures: Odds ratios calculated between DED and migraine headaches for participants as a whole and stratified by sex and age group. Results: The base population consisted of 72969 patients, including 41764 men (57.2%) and 31205 women (42.8%). Of these, 5352 patients (7.3%) carried a diagnosis of migraine headache, and 9638 (13.2%) carried a diagnosis of DED. The odds of having DED given a diagnosis of migraine headaches was 1.72 (95% CI, 1.60-1.85) times higher than that of patients without migraine headaches. After accounting for multiple confounding factors, the odds of having DED given a diagnosis of migraine headaches was 1.42 (95% CI, 1.20-1.68) times higher than that of patients without migraine headaches. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings suggest that patients with migraine headaches are more likely to have comorbid DED compared with the general population. Although this association may not reflect cause and effect if unidentified confounders account for the results, these data suggest that patients with migraine headaches may be at risk of carrying a comorbid diagnosis of DED. ? 2019 American Medical Association.

"The Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation: FLUid or vasopressors In Emergency Department Sepsis, a multicentre observational study (ARISE FLUIDS observational study): Rationale, methods and analysis plan",2019,"Objective: There is uncertainty about the optimal i.v. fluid volume and timing of vasopressor commencement in the resuscitation of patients with sepsis and hypotension. We aim to study current resuscitation practices in EDs in Australia and New Zealand (the Australasian Resuscitation In Sepsis Evaluation: FLUid or vasopressors In Emergency Department Sepsis [ARISE FLUIDS] observational study). Methods: ARISE FLUIDS is a prospective, multicentre observational study in 71 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand. It will include adult patients presenting to the ED during a 30 day period with suspected sepsis and hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg) despite at least 1000 mL fluid resuscitation. We will obtain data on baseline demographics, clinical and laboratory variables, all i.v. fluid given in the first 24 h, vasopressor use, time to antimicrobial administration, admission to intensive care, organ failure and in-hospital mortality. We will specifically describe (i) the volume of fluid administered at the following time points: when meeting eligibility criteria, in the first 6 h, at 24 h and prior to vasopressor commencement and (ii) the frequency and timing of vasopressor use in the first 6 h and at 24 h. Screening logs will provide reliable estimates of the proportion of ED patients meeting eligibility criteria for a subsequent randomised controlled trial. Discussion: This multicentre, observational study will provide insight into current haemodynamic resuscitation practices in patients with sepsis and hypotension as well as estimates of practice variation and patient outcomes. The results will inform the design and feasibility of a multicentre phase III trial of early haemodynamic resuscitation in patients presenting to ED with sepsis and hypotension. ? 2019 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine","antiinfective agent; vasoconstrictor agent; APACHE; Australia; clinical trial; drug effect; fluid therapy; hemodynamics; hospital emergency service; human; multicenter study; New Zealand; organization and management; procedures; resuscitation; sepsis; standards; time factor; Anti-Bacterial Agents; APACHE; Australia; Emergency Service, Hospital; Fluid Therapy; Hemodynamics; Humans; New Zealand; Resuscitation; Sepsis; Time Factors; Vasoconstrictor Agents"
"Long-term factor structure of the Rivermead Post-Concussion Symptom Questionnaire in mild traumatic brain injury and normative sample",2019,"Background: Previous studies of the Rivermead Post-Concussive Questionnaire(RPQ)’s factor structure were conducted within 1 year post-injury. Post-concussive symptoms may persist, and are common in the general population, so determining if the factor structure in mild-TBI and controls differ is important. This study examined factor structure of the RPQ in adults 4 years post-mild-TBI and in age-/gender-matched controls. Method: A total of?232 adults 4 years post-mild-TBI and 232 age-/gender-matched controls completed the RPQ. Results: Both samples produced a three-factor solution (57.98% and 56.44% of variance in the RPQ). Factor 1 for both samples included all RPQ items and accounted for the majority of variance explained (42.6% and 40.7%). After mild-TBI factor 2 included dizziness, vomiting/nausea, irritability, and double vision; whilst in controls it involved headache, dizziness, vomiting/nausea, and slowed thinking. Factor 3 for mild-TBI included vomiting/nausea, blurred vision, slowed thinking, and poor memory; while for controls it was restricted to visual symptoms (blurred vision, light sensitivity, double vision). Conclusion: The RPQ factor structure was similar for both groups, although differences were identified in lesser factors. This suggests those with mild-TBI differ minimally from matched controls in the very long term after injury. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adult; age; Article; controlled study; diplopia; disease duration; dizziness; female; gender; headache; human; irritability; major clinical study; male; memory disorder; nausea and vomiting; postconcussion syndrome; questionnaire; rivermead post concussion symptom questionnaire; traumatic brain injury"

"Impact of cardiac resynchronisation therapy on burden of hospitalisations and survival: A retrospective observational study in the Northern Region of New Zealand",2019,"Objective Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) devices have been shown to improve heart failure (HF) symptoms, survival and improve quality of life (QoL). We evaluated the overall impact of CRT on recurrent hospitalisations and survival in real-world patients with HF. Design Retrospective observational study. Setting Northern region of New Zealand. Participants Patients with HF who underwent CRT device implantation in between 2008 and 2014 were followed up for 1 year. Interventions CRT. Primary and secondary outcomes measured Survival, all-cause hospitalisations, length of stay, from which days alive and out of hospital (DAOH) were calculated. Results 177patients were included, of whom eight died (4.5%) within 1 year of follow-up. Pre-CRT implantation, 83% of all patients had been hospitalised for a total 248 hospitalisation events. Following CRT, 47 patients (27%) were readmitted to hospital within 1 year (total of 98 admissions; p<0.01 compared with pre-device implant). Length of hospital stay was significantly shorter than in the year prior to CRT implantation at a median of 4 (IQR 2-6) vs 7 (IQR 3.5-10.5) days (p=0.03). An increase in the median number of DAOH was observed from 362 (IQR 355-364) to 365 (IQR 364-365) (p<0.01) after CRT implant. The improvement in DAOH was seen regardless of gender and type of CRT devices. Greater DAOH was also seen in those with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and Caucasians. Conclusion After CRT implant, patients with HF have greater DAOH with reduction of total hospitalisation and fewer hospital days. These results support CRT devices use as a treatment option for appropriate HF patients. DAOH represents an easily measured, patient-centred endpoint that may reflect effectiveness of interventions in future CRT studies. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Methods: Informal primary carers for LiLACS NZ participants were interviewed about aspects of caregiving. Data were analysed by gender and ethnic group of the LiLACS NZ participant. Results: Carers were mostly adult children or partners, and three-quarters of them were women. M?ori and men received more hours of care with a higher estimated dollar value of care. M?ori men received the most personal care and household assistance. Carer employment, self-rated health, quality of life and impact of caring did not significantly relate to the gender and ethnicity of care recipients. Conclusions: Gender and ethnicity are interwoven in caregiving and care receiving.

"Clinical practice visits: a rapid review",2019,"Background: Practice visits are a peer review activity where one or more healthcare providers visit the practice of another in the same field. The purpose of this exercise is for visitors to observe and review a host’s practice in a non-punitive manner and provide them with constructive feedback as required; ultimately to improve practice quality and patient care. Methods: A rapid review of three biomedical databases was conducted to identify relevant literature published up until 9 April 2018. There were no limits placed on publication date or publication type. Two authors were responsible for study selection and data extraction using a priori inclusion criteria and extraction templates. Study details and key findings were reported narratively and in tables. Results: A total of nine publications, reporting outcomes for eight study groups, were identified as eligible for inclusion in this rapid review. Of these eight, six were observational studies, one was a longitudinal study and one was a randomized controlled trial. Practice visits were considered useful in identifying areas of improvement in professional practice; however, the rate at which these improvements were elicited varied greatly between the included studies. Overall, both hosts and visitors gained insight from the practice visit process and in general their experiences were positive. Conclusions: Based on the evidence provided by the included studies, recommendations for an effective practice visit can be made. Importantly, the poor quality and age of the literature from which these recommendations are based should be considered. ? 2019 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons","adult; clinical practice; constructive feedback; controlled study; data extraction; exercise; female; human; longitudinal study; male; medical practice; observational study; patient care; peer review; randomized controlled trial; review; total quality management"
"Pancreatic Hormone Responses to Mixed Meal Test in New-onset Prediabetes/Diabetes after Non-necrotizing Acute Pancreatitis",2020,"Aim:To investigate the pancreatic hormone responses to mixed meal test, in particular changes in insulin secretion, insulin sensitivity, and their interrelationship, in individuals with new-onset prediabetes or diabetes after non-necrotizing acute pancreatitis (NODAP) compared with healthy controls.Methods:Twenty-nine individuals with NODAP and 29 age-and sex-matched healthy controls were recruited. All participants (after fasting for at least 8 h) were given 12 oz. of BOOST drink and blood samples were collected before and after stimulation to measure insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and pancreatic polypeptide. Indices of insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IS, 1/fasting insulin, Raynaud, and Matsuda) and insulin secretion (HOMA-β, Stumvoll, insulinogenic index 30 and 60) were calculated. Repeated measures analyses were conducted in the unadjusted and adjusted models.Results:Insulin and C-peptide levels were significantly higher in individuals with NODAP compared with controls during mixed meal test in both the unadjusted (P=0.001 for both) and adjusted (P=0.004 and P=0.006, respectively) models. HOMA-IS (P=0.005), 1/fasting insulin (P=0.018), Raynaud index (P=0.018), and Matsuda index (P=0.021) were significantly lower in individuals with NODAP, whereas HOMA-β (P=0.028) and Stumvoll index (P=0.013) were significantly higher. Glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide levels did not differ significantly between NODAP and controls during mixed meal test in both the unadjusted (P=0.345 and P=0.206, respectively) and adjusted (P=0.359 and P=0.158, respectively) models.Conclusions:Decreased insulin sensitivity, β-cell compensation, and no significant change in postprandial levels of glucagon and pancreatic polypeptide characterize NODAP. The above findings may help develop an evidence-based protocol with a view to optimize control of glucose homeostasis in NODAP. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Precariously placed: Home, housing and wellbeing for older renters",2019,"Older renters may encounter a wide range of challenges and constraints in their experiences of ageing, housing and community life that influence their wellbeing. We employ a two-part conceptualisation of precarity and resilience to investigate how housing-related precarities may impact upon experiences of ageing and home during later life. We draw on narratives collected through in-depth interviews with 13 older renters living in a particularly high-pressure housing market within the greater Auckland area. We ground our analysis in ideas of precarity and resilience evident in participants' experiences of being ‘at home’ at the scale of both the dwelling and wider community. Results show that experiences of renting and ageing can be complicated and compromised in diverse ways by interrelated aspects of precarity and resilience related to housing, community, health, financial and personal circumstances. Distance or isolation from services and healthcare, tourism-related infrastructural pressures, and community changes can intensify precarious experiences of home, and can have implications for older people's wellbeing, as well as their ongoing opportunities to age well in place. In addition to these potential precarities, older renters appear to draw strength from their familiarity with, attachment to, and enjoyment of, place and community. These responses demonstrate older renters' capacity for resilience to challenge and adversity when ageing in rented places. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","aging population; health services; housing market; quality of life; rental sector; tourism; adult; article; housing; human; independent living; New Zealand; public health; tourism; wellbeing; Auckland [North Island]; New Zealand; North Island"
"Phenotypic and molecular dissection of metaplastic breast cancer and the prognostic implications",2019,"Metaplastic breast carcinoma (MBC) is relatively rare but accounts for a significant proportion of global breast cancer mortality. This group is extremely heterogeneous and by definition exhibits metaplastic change to squamous and/or mesenchymal elements, including spindle, squamous, chondroid, osseous, and rhabdomyoid features. Clinically, patients are more likely to present with large primary tumours (higher stage), distant metastases, and overall, have shorter 5-year survival compared to invasive carcinomas of no special type. The current World Health Organisation (WHO) diagnostic classification for this cancer type is based purely on morphology?–?the biological basis and clinical relevance of its seven sub-categories are currently unclear. By establishing the Asia-Pacific MBC (AP-MBC) Consortium, we amassed a large series of MBCs (n = 347) and analysed the mutation profile of a subset, expression of 14 breast cancer biomarkers, and clinicopathological correlates, contextualising our findings within the WHO guidelines. The most significant indicators of poor prognosis were large tumour size (T3; p = 0.004), loss of cytokeratin expression (lack of staining with pan-cytokeratin AE1/3 antibody; p = 0.007), EGFR overexpression (p = 0.01), and for ‘mixed’ MBC, the presence of more than three distinct morphological entities (p = 0.007). Conversely, fewer morphological components and EGFR negativity were favourable indicators. Exome sequencing of 30 cases confirmed enrichment of TP53 and PTEN mutations, and intriguingly, concurrent mutations of TP53, PTEN, and PIK3CA. Mutations in neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) were also overrepresented [16.7% MBCs compared to ?5% of breast cancers overall; enrichment p = 0.028; mutation significance p = 0.006 (OncodriveFM)], consistent with published case reports implicating germline NF1 mutations in MBC risk. Taken together, we propose a practically minor but clinically significant modification to the guidelines: all WHO_1 mixed-type tumours should have the number of morphologies present recorded, as a mechanism for refining prognosis, and that EGFR and pan-cytokeratin expression are important prognostic markers.

"Repeatability of Arterial Spin Labeling MRI in Measuring Blood Perfusion in the Human Eye",2019,"Background: Quantifying blood perfusion in ocular tissues is challenging, partly because the majority of the blood is carried by the choroid, which is difficult to visualize because it is located between the retina and sclera. Purpose/Hypothesis: To evaluate the intra- and interday repeatability of MRI measures of chorio-retinal blood perfusion. Study Type: Prospective, cross-sectional, observational study. Population: Twenty young healthy adults (six male, age: 25 ± 5 years) scanned twice within a single session repeated at the same time of day on 2 days. Field Strength/Sequence: Arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI at 3.0T using pseudocontinuous ASL (PCASL) labeling scheme and a 3D turbo-gradient-spin-echo (TGSE) acquisition, including axial T 2 -weighted structural images using a 2D turbo-spin-echo (TSE) sequence. Assessments: Region-of-interest analysis for assessment of chorio-retinal blood perfusion. Statistical Tests: Intra- and interday repeatability of measures analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), Pearson's correlation analysis, paired t-tests, and Bland–Altman plots. Results: The mean chorio-retinal perfusion was 77.86 (standard deviation [SD] = 29.80) ml/100ml/min. Perfusion measurements correlated strongly within a single session (r = 0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.880–0.980], P &lt; 0.001) and between the two sessions based on a single run (r = 0.80 [0.582–0.913], P &lt; 0.001), and two runs (r = 0.80 [0.479–0.918], P &lt; 0.001). There were mean differences of 2.69 [16.85 to –22.23] ml/100ml/min for intraday measures, –7.44 [27.45 to –42.32] ml/100ml/min for single-run interday measures, and 5.73 [28.71 to –40.17] ml/100ml/min for two-run interday measures, but none were significant (all P &gt; 0.05). Data Conclusion: Quantitative ASL-MRI measurements of chorio-retinal blood perfusion showed high intra- and interday repeatability.

"Interaction between leukocyte aldo-keto reductase 1C3 activity, genotypes, biological, lifestyle and clinical features in a prostate cancer cohort from New Zealand",2019,"Introduction Aldo-keto reductase 1C3 (AKR1C3) is known for multiple functions including its catalytic activity towards producing extra-testicular androgen. The present study is towards understanding interaction between biological, lifestyle and genetic impacts of AKR1C3 and their influence on clinical factors in a prostate cancer (PC) cohort from New Zealand (NZ). Method Characteristics of 516 PC patients were collected from the Auckland Regional Urology Facility, NZ. These men were genotyped for the AKR1C3 rs12529 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP). The leukocyte AKR1C3 activity was measured in a sub-cohort. Variability of leukocyte AKR1C3 activity between biological, lifestyle and clinical features as well as correlation between biological and clinical features were assessed with and without genetic stratification. Results The leukocyte AKR1C3 activity was associated with age at diagnosis (0.51 vs 0.34 μM coumberol units for >69y vs 69y, P = 0.03); and with anatomic stage/prognostic grouping among the AKR1C3 rs12529 CC genotype carriers (0.50 vs 28 μM coumberol units among low- and high-risk groups respectively, P = 0.02). Significant correlation between leukocyte AKR1C3 activity and age at PC diagnosis was also observed (correlation coefficient 0.20 and P = 0.02). Ever- smoking impacted both age and PSA at PC diagnosis among AKR1C3 rs12529 GG and CG genotype carriers respectively. Age at diagnosis significantly correlated with PSA at diagnosis in the main (correlation coefficient 0.29, and P<0.001) and sub-cohorts (correlation coefficient 0.24, and P = 0.01); and those carrying the AKR1C3 rs12529 CG and GG genotypes in both the main (correlation coefficient 0.30, and P<0.001 and correlation coefficient 0.35, and P<0.001 respectively) and sub-cohorts (correlation coefficient 0.43, and P<0.001 and correlation coefficient 0.39, and P = 0.06 respectively); but not with those carrying the CC genotype. Conclusions Age dependent PSA thresholds in PC screening could have been valid only in men carrying the AKR1C3 rs12529 CG and GG genotypes in this NZ cohort. ? 2019 Karunasinghe et al.

"A Life History Approach to the Female Sexual Orientation Spectrum: Evolution, Development, Causal Mechanisms, and Health",2019,"Women’s capacity for sexual fluidity is at least as interesting a phenomenon from the point of view of evolutionary biology and behavioral endocrinology as exclusively homosexual orientation. Evolutionary hypotheses for female nonheterosexuality have failed to fully account for the existence of these different categories of nonheterosexual women, while also overlooking broader data on the causal mechanisms, physiology, ontogeny, and phylogeny of female nonheterosexuality. We review the evolutionary-developmental origins of various phenotypes in the female sexual orientation spectrum using the synergistic approach of Tinbergen’s four questions. We also present femme-specific and butch-specific hypotheses at proximate and ultimate levels of analysis. This review article indicates that various nonheterosexual female phenotypes emerge from and contribute to hormonally mediated fast life history strategies. Life history theory provides a biobehavioral explanatory framework for nonheterosexual women’s masculinized body morphology, psychological dispositions, and their elevated likelihood of experiencing violence, substance use, obesity, teenage pregnancy, and lower general health. This pattern of life outcomes can create a feedback loop of environmental unpredictability and harshness which destabilizes intrauterine hormonal conditions in mothers, leading to a greater likelihood of fast life history strategies, global health problems, and nonheterosexual preferences in female offspring. We further explore the potential of female nonheterosexuality to function as an alloparental buffer that enables masculinizing alleles to execute their characteristic fast life history strategies as they appear in the female and the male phenotype. Synthesizing life history theory with the female sexual orientation spectrum enriches existing scientific knowledge on the evolutionary-developmental mechanisms of human sex differences. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""

"1D network simulations for evaluating regional flow and pressure distributions in healthy and asthmatic human lungs",2019,"This study aimed to introduce a one-dimensional (1D) computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model for airway resistance and lung compliance to examine the relationship between airway resistance, pressure, and regional flow distribution. We employed five healthy and five asthmatic subjects who had dynamic computed tomography (CT) scans (4D CT) along with two static scans at total lung capacity and functional residual capacity. Fractional air-volume change (Vair f ) from 4D CT was used for a validation of the 1D CFD model. We extracted the diameter ratio from existing data sets of 61 healthy subjects for computing mean and standard deviation (SD) of airway constriction/dilation in CT-resolved airways. The lobar mean (SD) of airway constriction/dilation was used to determine diameters of CT-unresolved airways. A 1D isothermal energy balance equation was solved, and pressure boundary conditions were imposed at the acinar region (model A) or at the pleural region (model B). A static compliance model was only applied for model B to link acinar and pleural regions. The values of 1D CFD-derived Vair f for model B demonstrated better correlation with 4D CT-derived Vair f than model A. In both inspiration and expiration, asthmatic subjects with airway constriction show much greater pressure drop than healthy subjects without airway constriction. This increased transpulmonary pressures in the asthmatic subjects, leading to an increased workload (hysteresis). The 1D CFD model was found to be useful in investigating flow structure, lung hysteresis, and pressure distribution for healthy and asthmatic subjects. The derived flow distribution could be used for imposing boundary conditions of 3D CFD. flow distribution could be used for imposing boundary conditions of three-dimensional CFD. ? 2019 American Physiological Society.

"International comparison of cosmetic outcomes of breast conserving surgery and radiation therapy for women with ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast",2020,"Purpose: To assess the cosmetic impact of breast conserving surgery (BCS), whole breast irradiation (WBI) fractionation and tumour bed boost (TBB) use in a phase III trial for women with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. Materials and methods: Baseline and 3-year cosmesis were assessed using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Cosmetic Rating System and digital images in a randomised trial of non-low risk DCIS treated with postoperative WBI +/? TBB. Baseline cosmesis was assessed for four geographic clusters of treating centres. Cosmetic failure was a global score of fair or poor. Cosmetic deterioration was a score change from excellent or good at baseline to fair or poor at three years. Odds ratios for cosmetic deterioration by WBI dose-fractionation and TBB use were calculated for both scoring systems. Results: 1608 women were enrolled from 11 countries between 2007 and 2014. 85–90% had excellent or good baseline cosmesis independent of geography or assessment method. TBB (16 Gy in 8 fractions) was associated with a >2-fold risk of cosmetic deterioration (p < 0.001). Hypofractionated WBI (42.5 Gy in 16 fractions) achieved statistically similar 3-year cosmesis compared to conventional WBI (50 Gy in 25 fractions) (p ? 0.18). The adverse impact of a TBB was not significantly associated with WBI fractionation (interaction p ? 0.30). Conclusions: Cosmetic failure from BCS was similar across international jurisdictions. A TBB of 16 Gy increased the rate of cosmetic deterioration. Hypofractionated WBI achieved similar 3-year cosmesis as conventional WBI in women treated with BCS for DCIS. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adult; aged; Article; brachytherapy; breast radiotherapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; computer assisted tomography; dosimetry; female; geography; human; intraductal carcinoma; major clinical study; multicenter study; odds ratio; partial mastectomy; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; prospective study; radiation dose fractionation; radiotherapy dosage"
"Physician rostering for workload balance",2019,"Continuity of care for patients, that is ensuring patients are treated by a single physician, is one of the most important concerns for hospital management in regards to general medicine (inpatient) departments. Discontinuous care occurs when the number of patients various physicians are caring for becomes imbalanced and patients are transferred between physicians to correct this. This issue can be addressed by constructing rosters for the physicians which aim to balance their patient workloads and thereby improve the continuity of care that patients receive. A mixed integer programme, which uses admission information coupled with a model of the patient pathways, is formulated to generate cyclic rosters for general medicine physicians. The capabilities of the model are demonstrated by applying it to a New Zealand hospital. A solution technique is also proposed and numerical experiments performed on the demonstration instance. ? 2018","adult; article; general practice; hospital management; hospital patient; human; New Zealand; patient care; physician; workload"
"Capturing the experience of the hospital-stay journey from admission to discharge using diaries completed by patients in their own words: A qualitative study",2019,"Objective To capture and better understand patients' experience during their healthcare journey from hospital admission to discharge, and to identify patient suggestions for improvement. Design Prospective, exploratory, qualitative study. Patients were asked to complete an unstructured written diary expressed in their own words, recording negative and positive experiences or anything else they considered noteworthy. Participants and setting Patients undergoing vascular surgery in a metropolitan hospital. Primary outcome measures Complete diary transcripts underwent a general inductive thematic analysis, and opportunities to improve the experience of care were identified and collated. Results We recruited 113 patients in order to collect 80 completed diaries from 78 participants (a participant response rate of 69%), recording patients' experiences of their hospital-stay journey. Participating patients were a median (range) age of 69 (21-99) years and diaries contained a median (range) of 197 (26-1672) words each. Study participants with a tertiary education wrote more in their diaries than those without - a median (range) of 353.5 (48-1672) vs 163 (26-1599) words, respectively (Mann-Whitney U test, p=0.001). Three primary and eight secondary themes emerged from analysis of diary transcripts - primary themes being: (1) communication as central to care; (2) importance of feeling cared for and (3) environmental factors shaping experiences. In the great majority, participants reported positive experiences on the hospital ward. However, a set of 12 patient suggestions for improvement were identified, the majority of which could be addressed with little cost but result in substantial improvements in patient experience. Half of the 12 suggestions for improvement fell into primary theme 1, concerning opportunities to improve communication between healthcare providers and patients. Conclusions Unstructured diaries completed in a patient's own words appear to be an effective and simple approach to capture the hospital-stay experience from the patient's own perspective, and to identify opportunities for improvement. ?

"The complexity of food provisioning decisions by m?ori caregivers to ensure the happiness and health of their children",2019,"Obesity in children is a global health concern. In New Zealand, one in three school entrant children are overweight or obese. M?ori, the indigenous people, are disproportionately represented among the lowest economic group and have a disproportionately high incidence of obesity. This study explored M?ori parents’ and caregivers’ views of the relative importance of weight to health, and the facilitators and barriers to a healthy weight in children aged 6 months to 5 years. Using a grounded qualitative method, in-depth information was collected in focus groups with mostly urban parents and other caregivers. A general inductive thematic analysis (content driven) was used. Insufficient money was an overriding food provisioning factor, but cost interacted with the lack of time, the number of people to feed, their appetites, and allergies. Other factors included ideologies about healthy food, cultural values relating to food selection, serving, and eating, nutrition literacy, availability of food, cooking skills, and lack of help. Childhood obesity was not a priority concern for participants, though they supported interventions providing education on how to grow vegetables, how to plan and cook cheaper meals. Holistic interventions to reduce the negative effects of the economic and social determinants on child health more broadly were recommended. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Effect of MyTeen SMS-Based Mobile Intervention for Parents of Adolescents: A Randomized Clinical Trial",2019,"Importance: There is global pressure to respond to the burden posed by adolescent mental health problems. The National Mental Health Commission has made a call for investment in mobile health services directed at prevention and early intervention to relieve the demand on targeted mental health services that are costly to provide. Parents and primary caregivers play a significant role in the lives of adolescents and are important targets for such efforts. Currently, there is no evidence for the effectiveness of programs delivered solely via text message for parents of adolescents. Objective: To evaluate the effects of a text-messaging program (MyTeen) on promoting parental competence and mental health literacy for parents of adolescents. Design, Setting, and Participants: A parallel 2-group randomized clinical trial was conducted in New Zealand. A total of 221 parents and primary caregivers of adolescents aged 10 to 15 years were recruited from March 19 to August 17, 2018, via community outreach and social media and were randomly allocated 1:1 into the control or the intervention group. Statistical analysis was performed on the principle of intention to treat with adjustment for baseline factors and ethnicity. Intervention: A text-messaging program for parents of adolescents (age 10-15 years) to promote parental competence and mental health literacy. Participants received 1 daily text message over 4 weeks. Main Outcomes and Measures: Parental competence, assessed at 1 month after randomization by the Parenting Sense of Competence Scale. Results: In total, 221 participants (214 [96.8%] female) were randomized, 109 to the intervention group and 112 to the control group; 201 participants (91%) completed the trial at 3 months. Significant group difference was observed on the primary outcome at the end of 1 month of intervention, with participants reporting a higher level of parental competence than those in the control group (estimated mean difference, 3.33 points; 95% CI, 1.37-5.29 points; P?=?.002). Except for knowledge about mental health, all secondary outcomes were significant, including continued improvement in parental competence at 3 months (estimated mean difference, 4.08 points; 95% CI, 1.96-6.20 points; P?<?.001), knowledge of help seeking (estimated mean difference, 0.99 points; 95% CI, 0.49-1.50 points; P?<?.001), parental distress (estimated mean difference, -2.39 points; 95% CI, -4.37 to -0.40 points; P?=?.02), and parent-adolescent communication (estimated mean difference, 2.21 points; 95% CI, 0.48-3.95 points; P?=?.01), with participants in the intervention group reporting better parenting-related outcomes than the control group at 1 and 3 months after the intervention. Conclusions and Relevance: This text-messaging program for parents of adolescents appears to be an effective and feasible way to facilitate the implementation and delivery of evidence-based information to populations that are not easily reached with other intervention modalities. The program can be easily scaled up for delivery as an early preventive intervention and may represent a less expensive option for service delivery.

"A soft exoglove equipped with a wearable muscle-machine interface based on forcemyography and electromyography",2019,"Soft, lightweight, underactuated assistive gloves (exogloves) can be useful for enhancing the capabilities of a healthy individual or to assist the rehabilitation of patients who suffer from conditions that limit the mobility of their fingers. However, most solutions found in the literature do not offer individual control of the fingers, hindering the execution of different types of grasps. In this letter, we focus on the development of a soft, underactuated, tendon-driven exo-glove that is equipped with a muscle-machine interface combining Electromyography and Forcemyography sensors to decode the user intent and allow the execution of specific grasp types. The device is experimentally tested and evaluated using different types of experiments: first, grasp experiments to assess the capability of the proposed muscle machine interface to discriminate between different grasp types and second, force exertion capability experiments, which evaluate the maximum forces that can be applied for different grasp types. The proposed device weighs 1150 g and costs \sim 1000 USD (in parts). The exoglove is capable of considerably improving the grasping capabilities of the user, facilitating the execution of different types of grasps and exerting forces up to 20 N. ? 2016 IEEE.","Exoskeleton (Robotics); Patient rehabilitation; Wearable technology; Assistive devices; Force exertion; Healthy individuals; Human performance; Individual control; Machine interfaces; Maximum forces; Tendon driven; Muscle"
"Identification of MRP2 as a targetable factor limiting oxaliplatin accumulation and response in gastrointestinal cancer",2019,"Oxaliplatin is important for the clinical treatment of colorectal cancer and other gastrointestinal malignancies, but tumour resistance is limiting. Several oxaliplatin transporters were previously identified but their relative contributions to determining oxaliplatin tumour responses and gastrointestinal tumour cell sensitivity to oxaliplatin remains unclear. We studied clinical associations between tumour expression of oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes and patient response to oxaliplatin, then experimentally verified associations found with MRP2 in models of human gastrointestinal cancer. Among 18 oxaliplatin transporter candidate genes, MRP2 was the only one to be differentially expressed in the tumours of colorectal cancer patients who did or did not respond to FOLFOX chemotherapy. Over-expression of MRP2 (endogenously in HepG2 and PANC-1 cells, or induced by stable transfection of HEK293 cells) decreased oxaliplatin accumulation and cytotoxicity but those deficits were reversed by inhibition of MRP2 with myricetin or siRNA knockdown. Mice bearing subcutaneous HepG2 tumour xenografts were sensitised to oxaliplatin antitumour activity by concurrent myricetin treatment with little or no increase in toxicity. In conclusion, MRP2 limits oxaliplatin accumulation and response in human gastrointestinal cancer. Screening tumour MRP2 expression levels, to select patients for treatment with oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy alone or in combination with a MRP2 inhibitor, could improve treatment outcomes. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"A pilot randomized controlled trial of a digital intervention aimed at improving food purchasing behavior: The front-of-pack food labels impact on consumer choice study",2019,"Background: Most food in the United Kingdom is purchased in supermarkets, and many of these purchases are routinely tracked through supermarket loyalty card data. Using such data may be an effective way to develop remote public health interventions and to measure objectively their effectiveness at changing food purchasing behavior. Objective: The Front-of-pack food Labels: Impact on Consumer Choice (FLICC) study is a pilot randomized controlled trial of a digital behavior change intervention. This pilot trial aimed to collect data on recruitment and retention rates and to provide estimates of effect sizes for the primary outcome (healthiness of ready meals and pizzas purchased) to inform a larger trial. Methods: The intervention consisted of a website where participants could access tailored feedback on previous purchases of ready meals and pizzas, set goals for behavior change, and model and practice the recommended healthy shopping behavior using traffic light labels. The control consisted of Web-based information on traffic light labeling. Participants were recruited via email from a list of loyalty card holders held by the participating supermarket. All food and drink purchases for the participants for the 6 months before recruitment, during the 6-week intervention period, and during a 12-week washout period were transferred to the research team by the participating supermarket. Healthiness of ready meals and pizzas was measured using a predeveloped scale based solely on the traffic light colors on the foods. Questionnaires were completed at recruitment, end of the intervention, and end of washout to estimate the effect of the intervention on variables that mediate behavior change (eg, belief and intention formation). Results: We recruited 496 participants from an initial email to 50,000 people. Only 3 people withdrew from the study, and purchase data were received for all other participants. A total of 208 participants completed all 3 questionnaires. There was no difference in the healthiness of purchased ready meals and pizzas between the intervention and control arms either during the intervention period (P=.32) or at washout (P=.59). Conclusions: Although the FLICC study did not find evidence of an impact of the intervention on food purchasing behavior, the unique methods used in this pilot trial are informative for future studies that plan to use supermarket loyalty card data in collaboration with supermarket partners. The experience of the trial showcases the possibilities and challenges associated with the use of loyalty card data in public health research. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

"Cell-Type-Specific Gene Expression Profiling in Adult Mouse Brain Reveals Normal and Disease-State Signatures",2019,"The role of brain cell-type-specific functions and profiles in pathological and non-pathological contexts is still poorly defined. Such cell-type-specific gene expression profiles in solid, adult tissues would benefit from approaches that avoid cellular stress during isolation. Here, we developed such an approach and identified highly selective transcriptomic signatures in adult mouse striatal direct and indirect spiny projection neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Integrating transcriptomic and epigenetic data, we obtained a comprehensive model for cell-type-specific regulation of gene expression in the mouse striatum. A cross-analysis with transcriptomic and epigenomic data generated from mouse and human Huntington's disease (HD) brains shows that opposite epigenetic mechanisms govern the transcriptional regulation of striatal neurons and glial cells and may contribute to pathogenic and compensatory mechanisms. Overall, these data validate this less stressful method for the investigation of cellular specificity in the adult mouse brain and demonstrate the potential of integrative studies using multiple databases. The contributions of neuronal and non-neuronal populations in cerebral functions are increasingly studied, but a robust and stress-limited method for cell-type-specific isolation is lacking.

"Caregiver's readiness for change as a predictor of outcome and attendance in an intervention programme for children and adolescents with obesity: A secondary data analysis",2019,"Objective/design It remains unclear as to the efficacy of readiness for change measurements in child and adolescent obesity intervention programmes. This observational study aimed to determine whether the caregiver's stage of change could predict outcome and adherence to treatment in an intensive intervention programme for children and adolescents with obesity. Setting Participants were from the Wh? nau Pakari randomised clinical trial, a community based multi-disciplinary intervention programme for obesity in Taranaki, New Zealand. Participants Eligible participants (recruited January 2012 to August 2014) were aged 5-16 years and had a body mass index (BMI) ?98th centile or BMI >91st centile with weight-related comorbidities. Interventions This study only assessed participants randomised to the high-intensity intervention programme (6-month assessments with weekly group sessions for 12 months) given attendance data were required (n=96). Primary and secondary outcome measures Primary trial outcome was BMI SD score (SDS). Secondary outcome measures included indices such as fruit and vegetable intake, 550-m run/walk time and quality of life scores. At baseline assessment, participants (if >11 years old) and their accompanying adult were assessed for readiness to make healthy lifestyle change. Results A quantitative measure of stage of change in caregivers was not a predictor of primary or secondary outcomes (change in BMI SDS pre-contemplation/contemplation -0.08, 95% CI -0.18 to 0.03, action -0.16, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.05, p=0.27), or overall attendance in the weekly activity sessions (40.0% vs 37.1%, respectively, p=0.54) in the child or adolescent. Conclusions Caregiver's stage of change was not a predictor of success in this multi-disciplinary assessment and intervention programme for children and adolescents with obesity.

Understanding the normal biological functions of calcitonin gene-related peptide is critical to understand the mechanisms of calcitonin gene-related peptide-blocking therapies as well as engineering improvements to these medications. Calcitonin gene-related peptide is closely related to other peptides in the calcitonin gene-related peptide family of peptides, including amylin. Relatedness in peptide sequence and in receptor biology makes it difficult to tease apart the contributions that each peptide and receptor makes to physiological processes and to disorders. Summary: The focus of this review is the expression of calcitonin gene-related peptide, related peptides and their receptors in the central nervous system. Calcitonin gene-related peptide is expressed throughout the nervous system, whereas amylin and adrenomedullin have only limited expression at discrete sites in the brain. The components of two receptors that respond to calcitonin gene-related peptide, the calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor (calcitonin receptor-like receptor with receptor activity-modifying protein 1) and the AMY 1 receptor (calcitonin receptor with receptor activity-modifying protein 1), are expressed throughout the nervous system. Understanding expression of the peptides and their receptors lays the foundation for more deeply understanding their physiology, pathophysiology and therapeutic use. ?

"Fibroblast growth factor 23 levels decline following sleeve gastrectomy",2019,"Objective: Levels of fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) have been positively associated with measures of adiposity, cardiovascular disease and mortality. It is unclear whether the relationship of FGF23 with cardiovascular disease and mortality is confounded by obesity. We aimed to determine whether FGF23 concentrations decline following a reduction in adiposity after sleeve gastrectomy (SG). Design: The effect of SG on FGF23 was evaluated in 22 obese adults (59% male) with type 2 diabetes. Fat mass, weight, BMI, plasma intact FGF23, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and leptin were determined at baseline and at 12?months following SG. Results: At baseline, median (IQR) age was 51 (43-54) years, fat mass 47.8 (41.0-59.4)?kg, BMI 40.9 (36.9-46.9)?kg/m2 and FGF23 66.2 (55.3-82.9)?pg/mL. Significant changes in median BMI (?10.8?kg/m2, 95% CI: ?12.9 to ?7.2, P?&lt;?0.0001), fat mass (?20.0?kg, 95% CI: ?26.7 to ?12.4, P?&lt;?0.0001) and weight (?34.7?kg, 95% CI ?40.0 to ?23.1, P?&lt;?0.0001) were observed after SG. FGF23 (?12.4?pg/mL, 95% CI: ?19.5 to 2.0, P?=?0.005), PTH (?1.1?pmol/L, 95% CI: ?1.7 to 0.2, P?=?0.009) and leptin (?1687?pg/mL, 95% CI ?4524 to ?563, P?=?0.01) declined following SG. Change in FGF23 was not significantly associated with change in measures of adiposity, PTH or leptin. Conclusions: FGF23 concentrations decline in the setting of significant weight loss following SG, implying that increased FGF23 concentrations are a downstream consequence of obesity, which may confound its association with cardiometabolic dysfunction. Mediators of the relationship between adiposity and FGF23 require further elucidation. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; 25 hydroxyvitamin D; calcium; colecalciferol; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; fibroblast growth factor 23; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; leptin; metformin; parathyroid hormone; sulfonylurea; vitamin D; adult; Article; body weight; body weight loss; clinical article; controlled study; double blind procedure; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; fat mass; female; human; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; parathyroid hormone blood level; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; secondary hyperparathyroidism; sleeve gastrectomy"
"Comparison of the accuracy of human readers versus machine-learning algorithms for pigmented skin lesion classification: an open, web-based, international, diagnostic study",2019,"Background: Whether machine-learning algorithms can diagnose all pigmented skin lesions as accurately as human experts is unclear. The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms with human readers for all clinically relevant types of benign and malignant pigmented skin lesions. Methods: For this open, web-based, international, diagnostic study, human readers were asked to diagnose dermatoscopic images selected randomly in 30-image batches from a test set of 1511 images. The diagnoses from human readers were compared with those of 139 algorithms created by 77 machine-learning labs, who participated in the International Skin Imaging Collaboration 2018 challenge and received a training set of 10 015 images in advance. The ground truth of each lesion fell into one of seven predefined disease categories: intraepithelial carcinoma including actinic keratoses and Bowen's disease; basal cell carcinoma; benign keratinocytic lesions including solar lentigo, seborrheic keratosis and lichen planus-like keratosis; dermatofibroma; melanoma; melanocytic nevus; and vascular lesions. The two main outcomes were the differences in the number of correct specific diagnoses per batch between all human readers and the top three algorithms, and between human experts and the top three algorithms. Findings: Between Aug 4, 2018, and Sept 30, 2018, 511 human readers from 63 countries had at least one attempt in the reader study. 283 (55·4%) of 511 human readers were board-certified dermatologists, 118 (23·1%) were dermatology residents, and 83 (16·2%) were general practitioners. When comparing all human readers with all machine-learning algorithms, the algorithms achieved a mean of 2·01 (95% CI 1·97 to 2·04; p<0·0001) more correct diagnoses (17·91 [SD 3·42] vs 19·92 [4·27]). 27 human experts with more than 10 years of experience achieved a mean of 18·78 (SD 3·15) correct answers, compared with 25·43 (1·95) correct answers for the top three machine algorithms (mean difference 6·65, 95% CI 6·06–7·25; p<0·0001). The difference between human experts and the top three algorithms was significantly lower for images in the test set that were collected from sources not included in the training set (human underperformance of 11·4%, 95% CI 9·9–12·9 vs 3·6%, 0·8–6·3; p<0·0001). Interpretation: State-of-the-art machine-learning classifiers outperformed human experts in the diagnosis of pigmented skin lesions and should have a more important role in clinical practice. However, a possible limitation of these algorithms is their decreased performance for out-of-distribution images, which should be addressed in future research.

"The food supply prior to the implementation of the chilean law of food labeling and advertising",2019,"This study aimed to evaluate the composition of the food supply ahead of the implementation of the Chilean Law of Food Labeling and Advertising (Law 20.606) in June 2016. The INFORMAS (International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs) Research, Monitoring and Action Support) framework for monitoring the composition of the food supply was used. The Law’s initial (2016) and final (2019) limits were used to evaluate if foods would receive a “High in” warning for Calories, Sodium, Sugars and/or Saturated Fats (initial/final, solids: >350/275 kcal; >800/400 mg; >22.5/10 g; >6/4 g; liquids: >100/70 kcal; >100/100 mg; >6/5 g; >3/3 g respectively). Foods were excluded if they required reconstitution, had missing information or if total labeled energy was estimated as incorrect (n = 942). In February 2015 and 2016, fieldworkers photographed a purposeful sample of packaged food and beverage products (n = 5421 and n = 5479) from 6 different supermarkets in Santiago, Chile. Seven percent of foods had no added critical nutrients (n = 720). Two-thirds of products had critical nutrients exceeding at least one initial limit indicative of a “high in” warning. Under the final phase limits, only 17% of foods would have zero warning labels. By 2019, 10 of the 17 food and beverage categories studied are predicted to have less than half of their products without a high in sodium warning label. While 8 of the 17 categories studied are predicted to have less than half their products without a high in total sugars or a high in total calories warning label, respectively; while even fewer food and beverage categories are predicted to be without a high in saturated fat warning label. Most products will have to be reformulated to avoid at least one front-of-package warning label. ? 2018 by the authors.

"Augmented pseudo-likelihood estimation for two-phase studies",2019,"In many public health and medical research settings, information on key covariates may not be readily available or too expensive to gather for all individuals in the study. In such settings, the two-phase design provides a way forward by first stratifying an initial (large) phase I sample on the basis of covariates readily available (including, possibly, the outcome), and sub-sampling participants at phase II to collect the expensive measure(s). When the outcome of interest is binary, several methods have been proposed for estimation and inference for the parameters of a logistic regression model, including weighted likelihood, pseudo-likelihood and maximum likelihood. Although these methods yield consistent estimation and valid inference, they do so solely on the basis of the phase I stratification and the detailed covariate information obtained at phase II. Moreover, they ignore any additional information that is readily available at phase I but was not used as part of the stratified sampling design. Motivated by the potential for efficiency gains, especially concerning parameters corresponding to the additional phase I covariates, we propose a novel augmented pseudo-likelihood estimator for two-phase studies that makes use of all available information. In contrast to recently-proposed weighted likelihood-based methods that calibrate to the influence function of the model of interest, the methods we propose do not require the development of additional models and, therefore, enjoy a degree of robustness. In addition, we expand the broader framework for pseudo-likelihood based estimation and inference to permit link functions for binary regression other than the logit link. Comprehensive simulations, based on a one-time cross sectional survey of 82,887 patients undergoing anti-retroviral therapy in Malawi between 2005 and 2007, illustrate finite sample properties of the proposed methods and compare their performance competing approaches. The proposed method yields the lowest standard errors when the model is correctly specified. Finally, the methods are applied to a large implementation science project examining the effect of an enhanced community health worker program to improve adherence to WHO guidelines for at least four antenatal visits, in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. ?

"Adult cancer risk in women who were breastfed as infants: large UK prospective study",2019,"There are known short-term benefits in breastfed infants versus bottle-fed infants in terms of lower risks of infection and obesity in infancy and childhood, but the long-term effect on the risk of adult cancers is unclear. In a cohort of 1 in 4 UK women born in 1935–1950 we report the incidence of adult cancers in relation to having been breastfed in infancy. In median year 2001 (interquartile range 2000–2003) 548,741 women without prior cancer reported whether they had been breastfed. There was 81% agreement between women’s report of having been breastfed and information on breastfeeding recorded when they were 2?years old. Participants were followed by record-linkage to national cancer registration, hospital admission and death databases. Cox regression yielded adjusted relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) by having been breastfed or not for eight cancer sites with > 2000 incident cases and for related conditions, where appropriate. Of the eight cancers examined here one association was highly statistically significant: an increase in colorectal cancer incidence among women who had been breastfed versus not (RR 1.18, 95% CI 1.12–1.24, n = 8651). To investigate further the findings for colorectal cancer, we studied eight other gastro-intestinal conditions, and found increased risks in women who had been breastfed versus not for benign colorectal polyps (RR 1.09, 95% CI 1.05–1.13, n = 17,677) and for appendicitis (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.07–1.31, n = 2108). The greater risks of adult colorectal cancer, colorectal polyps and appendicitis associated with having been breastfed in infancy suggest possible long-term effects of infant feeding practices on the gastrointestinal tract. Further studies are required to clarify this novel association. ? 2019, The Author(s).","adult; alcohol consumption; appendicitis; Article; birth weight; body mass; breast cancer; caloric intake; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer registry; cancer risk; colorectal cancer; colorectal polyp; controlled study; disease association; female; follow up; hospital admission; human; infant feeding; inflammatory bowel disease; major clinical study; prospective study; United Kingdom; age distribution; aged; breast feeding; cohort analysis; colorectal tumor; comparative study; feeding behavior; gastrointestinal disease; incidence; infant; medical record; middle aged; obesity; risk factor; very elderly; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Feeding; Cohort Studies; Colorectal Neoplasms; Feeding Behavior; Female; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Medical Record Linkage; Middle Aged; Obesity; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; United Kingdom"
"Study protocol: Associations between dietary patterns, cognitive function and metabolic syndrome in older adults - A cross-sectional study",2019,"Background: Loss of cognitive function is a significant issue as the world's population ages. Preserving cognitive function maintains independence in older adults bringing major societal and financial benefits. Lifestyle factors such as diet are modifiable risk factors, which may help preserve cognitive function. Most nutrition research aimed at preserving cognitive function and metabolic health has focussed on individual nutrients and foods, not allowing for food combinations and interactions. A dietary pattern approach considers the entire diet including its complexity. Previous research investigating dietary patterns and cognitive function has not always considered relevant covariates such as physical activity and the Apolipoprotein E genotype, which are known to have associations with cognitive function. The aim of the REACH (Researching Eating, Activity and Cognitive Health) study is to investigate associations between dietary patterns, cognitive function and metabolic syndrome, accounting for a range of covariates. Methods: This cross-sectional study design will recruit older, community-living adults (65-74 years) from Auckland, New Zealand. Dietary data will be collected via a 109-item food frequency questionnaire validated using a 4-day food record. Cognitive function will be assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (paper based) and the Computerised Mental Performance Assessment System (COMPASS) - a testing suite covering six domains. Additional data will include genetic (Apolipoprotein E ?4) and biochemical markers (fasting glucose, HbA1c, lipids profile), anthropometric measurements (weight, height, waist and hip circumference, body composition using dual X-ray absorptiometry), blood pressure, physical activity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire - short form) and health and demographics (questionnaire). Dietary patterns will be derived by principal component analysis. Associations between cognitive function and dietary patterns will be examined using multiple regression analysis. Covariates and interaction factors will include age, education, socio-economic status, physical activity, Apolipoprotein E ?4 genotype, family history of dementia or cognitive impairment, and lifestyle factors. Differences between participants with and without metabolic syndrome will also be examined. Discussion: This study will bring new knowledge regarding associations between dietary patterns and cognitive function and metabolic health in older adults living in New Zealand. This is important for developing nutrition related recommendations to help older adults maintain cognitive function. ? 2019 The Author(s).","aged; body weight; cognition; cognitive defect; cross-sectional study; diet; exercise; female; food preference; geriatric nutrition; human; lifestyle; male; metabolic syndrome X; New Zealand; physiology; psychology; questionnaire; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Body Weight; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Elder Nutritional Physiological Phenomena; Exercise; Female; Food Preferences; Humans; Life Style; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; New Zealand; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Body composition: Population epidemiology and concordance in Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents",2019,"Objectives Overweight and obesity remain at historically high levels, cluster within families and are established risk factors for multiple diseases. We describe the epidemiology and cross-generational concordance of body composition among Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents. Design The population-based cross-sectional Child Health CheckPoint study, nested within the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Setting Assessment centres in seven major Australian cities and eight regional cities, or home visits; February 2015-March 2016. Participants Of all participating CheckPoint families (n=1874), body composition data were available for 1872 children (49% girls) and 1852 parents (mean age 43.7 years; 88% mothers), including 1830 biological parentchild pairs. Measures Height, weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference and waist-to-height ratio for all participants; body fat and fat-free mass by four-limb bioimpedence analysis (BIA) at assessment centres, or body fat percentage by two-limb BIA at home visits. Analysis: Parent-child concordance was assessed using (i) Pearson's correlation coefficients, and (ii) partial correlation coefficients adjusted for age, sex and socioeconomic disadvantage. Survey weights and methods accounted for LSAC's complex sample design. Results 20.7% of children were overweight and 6.2% obese, as were 33.5% and 31.6% of parents. Boys and girls showed similar distributions for all body composition measures but, despite similar BMI and waist-to-height ratio, mothers had higher proportions of total and truncal fat than fathers. Parent-child partial correlations were greatest for height (0.37, 95% CI 0.33 to 0.42). Other anthropometric and fat/lean measures showed strikingly similar partial correlations, ranging from 0.25 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.29) for waist circumference to 0.30 (95% CI 0.25 to 0.34) for fat-free percentage. Whole-sample and sex-specific percentile values are provided for all measures. Conclusions Excess adiposity remains prevalent in Australian children and parents. Moderate crossgenerational concordance across all measures of leanness and adiposity is already evident by late childhood. ? 2019 Author(s).","adult; Article; Australian; body composition; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; child; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; fat free mass; father; female; human; longitudinal study; male; mother; obesity; population research; school child; sex difference; waist circumference; waist to height ratio"
"Relationships of maternal body mass index and plasma biomarkers with childhood body mass index and adiposity at 6?years: The Children of SCOPE study",2019,"Background: Maternal obesity has been implicated in the origins of childhood obesity through a suboptimal environment in-utero. Objective: We examined relationships of maternal early pregnancy body mass index (BMI), overweight/obesity, and plasma biomarkers of obesity, inflammation, insulin resistance, and placental function with measures of childhood BMI and adiposity. Methods: BMI z-score, sum of skinfold thicknesses (SST), body fat percentage (BFP, by bioelectrical impedance), and waist, arm, and hip circumferences were measured in 1173 6-year-old children of nulliparous pregnant women in the Screening for Pregnancy Endpoints (SCOPE) study, New Zealand. Relationships of maternal early pregnancy (15?weeks' gestation) BMI and biomarkers with these childhood anthropometric measures were assessed by linear regression, with appropriate adjustment. Results: 28.1% of mothers were classified as overweight and 10.1% with obesity; compared with normal weight mothers, the BFP of their children were 5.3% higher (0.16 SD [95% CI, 0.04-0.29] p?=.01) and 7.8% higher (0.27 [0.08-0.47] p?=.006) with comparable values for BMI z-score and arm, waist, and hip circumferences. Early pregnancy maternal BMI and plasma placental growth factor (PlGF) were associated with higher child's SST, BMI z-score, hip circumference, and BFP. None of the metabolic or inflammatory maternal biomarkers were associated with childhood obesity. Conclusion: In this contemporary large prospective cohort study with extensive maternal/childhood phenotyping and a high prevalence of maternal overweight/obesity, we found independent relationships of maternal early pregnancy BMI with childhood BMI and adiposity; similar associations were observed with PlGF, which may imply a role for placenta function in the developmental programming of childhood obesity risk. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation","placental growth factor; adult; anthropometry; arm circumference; Article; body composition; body fat; body height; body mass; body weight; child; child nutrition; childhood obesity; clinical study; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; first trimester pregnancy; gestational age; hip circumference; human; impedance; inflammation; insulin resistance; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; maternal nutrition; maternal obesity; New Zealand; nullipara; placenta function; pregnancy complication; pregnant woman; preschool child; priority journal; protein blood level; skinfold thickness; waist circumference"
"Pulse rate variability predicts atrial fibrillation and cerebrovascular events in a large, population-based cohort",2019,"Background: Many patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) present with stroke as their first clinical manifestation and since improved AF screening methods are thus required, we investigated whether pulse rate variability parameters predict future AF and cerebrovascular events. Methods: In an observational cohort study of 5000 community-resident adults (58% male; 50–84 years), the beat-to-beat variability of suprasystolic brachial blood pressure waveforms was measured with root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and irregularity index (IrrIx). Based on outcome-oriented and previously validated thresholds for detecting AF, RMSSD and IrrIx were dichotomised at 100 ms and 7.7%, respectively. Participants were followed up for 4.6 years (median), accruing 249 AF and 120 cerebrovascular events in the total sample (n = 5000), and 133 AF and 90 cerebrovascular events among those without prior AF diagnosis (n = 4296). Results: In multivariable-adjusted analyses, an elevated RMSSD (>100 ms) or IrrIx (>7.7%) was strongly associated with a higher risk of AF (hazard ratios (HRs) = 2.00–2.95) and cerebrovascular events (HRs = 1.91–2.28), even among people without prior AF diagnosis: HRs for AF = 1.70–2.05 and cerebrovascular events = 2.00–2.28. These associations were strongest in the highest RMSSD tertile >100 ms or IrrIx tertile >7.7%: HRs for AF = 2.32–4.47 and cerebrovascular events = 2.43–3.69. Among those without prior AF diagnosis, the highest categorical net reclassification improvement for 5-year cerebrovascular risk was 14% (95% confidence interval: 7–21%). Conclusions: Elevated RMSSD or IrrIx values indicative of the presence of AF predict future AF and cerebrovascular events; more so with increasing pulse irregularity and even among those without prior AF diagnosis. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; blood pressure; cardiovascular parameters; cardiovascular risk; case control study; cerebrovascular disease; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; high risk population; human; irregularity index; major clinical study; male; observational study; prediction; priority journal; pulse rate; quality of life; root mean square of successive difference; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; complication; electrocardiography; follow up; health survey; heart rate; incidence; middle aged; multicenter study; New Zealand; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prognosis; reproducibility; risk assessment; risk factor; time factor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atrial Fibrillation; Blood Pressure; Electrocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Rate; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Population Surveillance; Prognosis; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke; Time Factors"
"Targeting growth hormone function: strategies and therapeutic applications",2019,"Human growth hormone (GH) is a classical pituitary endocrine hormone that is essential for normal postnatal growth and has pleiotropic effects across multiple physiological systems. GH is also expressed in extrapituitary tissues and has localized autocrine/paracrine effects at these sites. In adults, hypersecretion of GH causes acromegaly, and strategies that block the release of GH or that inhibit GH receptor (GHR) activation are the primary forms of medical therapy for this disease. Overproduction of GH has also been linked to cancer and the microvascular complications that are associated with diabetes. However, studies to investigate the therapeutic potential of GHR antagonism in these diseases have been limited, most likely due to difficulty in accessing therapeutic tools to study the pharmacology of the receptor in vivo. This review will discuss current and emerging strategies for antagonizing GH function and the potential disease indications. ? 2019, The Author(s).","angiopeptin; antisense oligonucleotide; atesidorsen; cabergoline; calcium; cytokine receptor; ephrin receptor A4; growth factor receptor; growth hormone; Janus kinase 2; messenger RNA; navitoclax; octreotide; pasireotide; pegvisomant; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; prolactin receptor; protein inhibitor of activated STAT; protein SH2; protein tyrosine kinase; protein tyrosine phosphatase; rapamycin; somatomedin C; somatostatin receptor; STAT5 protein; suppressor of cytokine signaling; suppressor of cytokine signaling 2; transcription factor Pit 1; unindexed drug; veldoreotide; acromegaly; Akt signaling; amino acid transport; calcium transport; cancer growth; cancer risk; cardiovascular risk; computer assisted radiotherapy; diabetes mellitus; down regulation; endometrium tumor; gene expression; GH1 cell line (pituitary tumor); growth hormone secreting cell; hormonal regulation; hormonal therapy; hormone action; hormone inhibition; hormone release; human; hypopituitarism; lipolysis; mineral metabolism; neoplasm; phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phosphorylation; Pi3K/Akt signaling; quality of life; Review; secretory pathway; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; upregulation"
"Childhood obesity in New Zealand",2019,"Background: Paediatric obesity has reached epidemic proportions globally, resulting in significant adverse effects on health and wellbeing. Early life events, including those that happen before, during, and after pregnancy can predispose children to later obesity. The purpose of this review is to examine the magnitude of obesity among New Zealand children and adolescents, and to determine their underlying risk factors and associated comorbidities. Data sources: PubMed, Web of Science, and Google Scholar searches were performed using the key terms “obesity”, “overweight”, “children”, “adolescents”, and “New Zealand”. Results: Obesity is a major public health concern in New Zealand, with more than 33% of children and adolescents aged 2–14?years being overweight or obese. Obesity disproportionately affects M?ori (New Zealand’s indigenous population) and Pacific children and adolescents, as well as those of lower socioeconomic status. New Zealand’s obesity epidemic is associated with numerous health issues, including cardiometabolic, gastrointestinal, and psychological problems, which also disproportionately affect M?ori and Pacific children and adolescents. Notably, a number of factors may be useful to identify those at increased risk (such as demographic and anthropometric characteristics) and inform possible interventions. Conclusions: The prevalence of overweight and obese children and adolescents in New Zealand is markedly high, with a greater impact on particular ethnicities and those of lower socioeconomic status. Alleviating the current burden of pediatric obesity should be a key priority for New Zealand, for the benefit of both current and subsequent generations. Future strategies should focus on obesity prevention, particularly starting at a young age and targeting those at greatest risk. ? 2019, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine.","anthropometric parameters; asthma; body mass; cardiometabolic risk; childhood obesity; comorbidity; demography; dyslipidemia; ethnicity; human; hypertension; New Zealand; prenatal care; prevalence; Review; sleep disordered breathing; social psychology; social status"
"Effect of extended hours dialysis on sleep quality in a randomized trial",2019,"Aim: Poor sleep quality is common in haemodialysis patients and associated with worse outcomes. In this pre-specified analysis, we examined the impact of extended hours haemodialysis on sleep quality. Methods: The ACTIVE Dialysis trial randomized 200 participants to extended (?24 h/week) or standard (target 12–15 h) hours haemodialysis over 12 months. Sleep quality was measured in the Kidney Disease Quality of Life Short Form 1.3 (KDQOL-SF) by overall sleep quality score (0–10, 10 = ‘very good’) and the sleep subscale (0–100, 100 = ‘best possible sleep’) every 3 months via blinded telephone interview. The average intervention effect was calculated by mixed linear regression adjusted by time point and baseline score. Factors predicting sleep quality were assessed by multivariate regression analysis. Results: Overall sleep quality score and sleep subscale at baseline were similar in both groups (5.9 [95%CI 5.4–6.4] vs. 6.3 [5.9–6.8]; 65.0 [60.9–69.1] vs. 63.2 [59.1–67.3]; extended and standard hours, respectively). Extended hours haemodialysis led to a non-significant improvement in overall sleep quality score (average intervention effect 0.44 (?0.01 to 0.89), P = 0.053) and sleep subscale (average intervention effect 3.58 (?0.02 to 7.18), P = 0.051). Poor sleep quality was associated with being female and with current smoking. Sleep quality was positively associated with EuroQol-5D (EQ5D) and the SF-36 Physical Component and Mental Component Summary Scores but not with hospitalizations.

"The validity and reliability of a kinect v2-based gait analysis system for children with cerebral palsy",2019,"The aim of this study is to evaluate if Kinect is a valid and reliable clinical gait analysis tool for children with cerebral palsy (CP), and whether linear regression and long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network methods can improve its performance. A gait analysis was conducted on ten children with CP, on two occasions. Lower limb joint kinematics computed from the Kinect and a traditional marker-based Motion Analysis system were investigated by calculating the root mean square errors (RMSE), the coefficients of multiple correlation (CMC), and the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC2,k). Results showed that the Kinect-based kinematics had an overall modest to poor correlation (CMC—less than 0.001 to 0.70) and an angle pattern similarity with Motion Analysis. After the calibration, RMSE on every degree of freedom decreased. The two calibration methods indicated similar levels of improvement in hip sagittal (CMC—0.81 ± 0.10 vs. 0.75 ± 0.22)/frontal (CMC—0.41 ± 0.35 vs. 0.42 ± 0.37) and knee sagittal kinematics (CMC—0.85±0.07 vs. 0.87 ± 0.12). The hip sagittal (CMC—0.97±0.05) and knee sagittal (CMC—0.88 ± 0.12) angle patterns showed a very good agreement over two days. Modest to excellent reliability (ICC2,k—0.45 to 0.93) for most parameters renders it feasible for observing ongoing changes in gait kinematics. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Antibiotics for treating urogenital Chlamydia trachomatis infection in men and non-pregnant women",2019,"Background: The genital infection caused by Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) globally. The infection is mainly asymptomatic in women, thus it can produce infertility and chronic pelvic pain. In men infection is mainly symptomatic, but can evolve to prostatitis. Clinical practice guidelines for CT urogenital infections do not give any specific recommendation about which antibiotic use as first option Objectives: To assess the efficacy and safety of antibiotic treatment for CT genital infection in men and non-pregnant women. Search methods: The Cochrane Sexually Transmitted Infections' (STI) Information Specialist developed the electronic searches in electronic databases (CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS), and trials registers. We searched studies published from inception to June 2018. Selection criteria: We included parallel, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of men, and sexually-active, non-pregnant women with CT infection (urethritis or uterine cervicitis or asymptomatic), diagnosed by cell culture for CT, nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT) or antigen-based detection methods, who had been treated with any of the antibiotic regimens recommended by any of the updated to 2013 CT Guidelines. Data collection and analysis: Four review authors screened evidence according to selection criteria and independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. Two authors developed the 'Summary of findings' tables. We used a fixed-effect meta-analysis model for combining data where it was reasonable to assume that studies were estimating the same underlying treatment effect. We estimated the pooled risk ratio in order to establish the effects of the comparisons. Our primary outcomes were microbiological failure and adverse events, and our secondary outcomes were clinical failure, antimicrobial resistance and reinfection. Main results: We selected 14 studies ( 2715 participants: 2147 (79.08%) men and 568 (20.92%) women). The studies were conducted mainly at STD clinics. Sample sizes ranged from 71 to 606 participants; follow-up was 29.7 days on average. For the comparison: azithromycin single dose versus doxycycline once or twice daily for 7 days, in men treated for CT, the risk of microbiological failure was higher in the azithromycin group (RR 2.45, 95% CI 1.36 to 4.41; participants = 821; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence), but regarding clinical failure, the results showed that the effect is uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.43 to 2,05; I2 = 55%; participants = 525; studies = 3; low-quality evidence). Regarding adverse events (AE) in men there could be little or no difference between the antibiotics (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.67 to 1.02; participants = 1424; studies = 6; low-quality evidence). About women treated for CT, the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR = 1.71, 95% CI 0.48 to 6.16; participants = 338; studies = 5; very low-quality evidence). There were no studies assessing clinical failure or adverse events in women, however, we found that azithromycin probably has fewer adverse events in both genders (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98; I2 = 0%; participants = 2261; studies = 9; moderate-quality evidence). For the second comparison: doxycycline compared to ofloxacin, for men treated for CT the effect on microbiological failure was uncertain (RR 8.53, 95% CI 0.43 to 167.38, I2 not applicable; participants = 80; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence), as also it was on clinical failure (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.28 to 2.62; participants = 36; studies = 1; very low-quality evidence). The effect of in women on clinical failure was uncertain (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.39 to 2.25; I2 = 39%; participants = 127; studies = 2; very low-quality evidence).Regarding adverse events, the effect in both men and women was uncertain (RR 1.02 95% CI 0.66 to 1.55; participants = 339 studies = 3; very low-quality evidence). The effect on microbiological failure in women and in men and women together, the effect on microbiological failure was not estimable. The most frequently AE reported were not serious and of gastrointestinal origin.No studies assessed antimicrobial resistance or reinfection in either comparison. Authors' conclusions: In men, regimens with azithromycin are probably less effective than doxycycline for microbiological failure, however, there might be little or no difference for clinical failure. For women, we are uncertain whether azithromycin compared to doxycycline increases the risk of microbiological failure. Azithromycin probably slightly reduces adverse events compared to doxycycline in men and women together but may have little difference in men alone. We are uncertain whether doxycycline compared to ofloxacin reduces microbiological failure in men or women alone, or men and women together, nor if it reduces clinical failure or adverse events in men or women. Based on the fact that women suffer mainly asymptomatic infections, and in order to test the effectiveness and safety of the current recommendations (azithromycin, doxycycline and ofloxacin), for CT infection, especially in low and middle income countries, future RCTs should be designed and conducted to include a large enough sample size of women, and with low risk of bias. It is also important that future RCTs include adherence, CT resistance to antibiotic regimens, and risk of reinfection as outcomes to be measured. In addition, it is important to conduct a network meta-analysis in order to evaluate all those studies that included in one arm only the current antibiotic treatments for CT infection that are recommended by the updated clinical practice guidelines. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.","antibiotic agent; azithromycin; doxycycline; erythromycin; levofloxacin; macrolide; ofloxacin; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; tetracycline; antiinfective agent; azithromycin; doxycycline; ofloxacin; abdominal pain; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; antibiotic therapy; antigen detection; cell culture; Chlamydia trachomatis; chlamydial urethritis; chlamydiasis; drug efficacy; drug safety; enzyme immunoassay; erythema multiforme; fatigue; follow up; gastrointestinal disease; headache; heartburn; hemoglobinopathy; human; immunofluorescence test; leukocyte count; microbiological parameters; minimum inhibitory concentration; myalgia; nausea; nucleic acid amplification; outcome assessment; practice guideline; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); reinfection; Review; sample size; sex ratio; sexual behavior; side effect; single drug dose; skin lupus erythematosus; Stevens Johnson syndrome; systematic review; therapy effect; treatment failure; treatment outcome; uterine cervicitis; asymptomatic infection; Chlamydia trachomatis; chlamydiasis; female; male; meta analysis; sex factor; urinary tract infection; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Asymptomatic Infections; Azithromycin; Chlamydia Infections; Chlamydia trachomatis; Doxycycline; Female; Humans; Male; Ofloxacin; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Sex Factors; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Tract Infections"
"Trends in weight-related attitudes and behaviours among New Zealand adolescents, between 2007 and 2012",2019,"Aim: To explore secular trends of adolescent weight control concerns and behaviours, between 2007 and 2012, and determine if these vary by body size. Methods: Data were drawn from two nationally representative youth health surveys, Youth’07 and Youth’12. Multiple logistic regression models were used to determine differences in the prevalence of weight control behaviours and concerns between the two time points, controlling for socio-demographic variables. Results: Between 2007 and 2012, both boys and girls were significantly more likely to report concerns about their weight, though the prevalence of trying to lose weight increased for boys, but not girls. Trends in weight control behaviours varied by body size for boys and girls. Perhaps the most striking findings were the increases in proportions of underweight girls and healthy weight boys who were trying to lose weight. Conclusions: The current study highlights the growing concerns that young people are experiencing in relation to weight control. Given the persistently high rates of adolescent obesity in New Zealand and globally, greater support for young people with regards to healthy eating and weight management is warranted. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","adolescent; adolescent behavior; adolescent obesity; Article; attitude to health; body size; body weight control; body weight loss; body weight management; controlled study; demography; female; health survey; healthy diet; human; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; prevalence; priority journal; underweight"
"Site-specific glycation of A1- 42 affects fibril formation and is neurotoxic",2019,"A1- 42 is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and is prone to glycation, an irreversible process where proteins accumulate advanced glycated end products (AGEs). N-(Carboxyethyl)lysine (CEL) is a common AGE associated with AD patients and occurs at either Lys-16 or Lys-28 of A1- 42. Methyglyoxal is commonly used for the unspecific glycation of A1- 42, which results in a complex mixture of AGE-modified peptides and makes interpretation of a causative AGE at a specific amino acid residue difficult. We address this issue by chemically synthesizing defined CEL modifications on A1- 42 at Lys-16 (A-CEL16), Lys-28 (A-CEL28), and Lys-16 and -28 (A-CEL16&28). We demonstrated that double-CEL glycations at Lys-16 and Lys-28 of A1- 42 had the most profound impact on the ability to form amyloid fibrils. In silico predictions indicated that A-CEL16&28 had a substantial decrease in free energy change, which contributes to fibril destabilization, and a increased aggregation rate. Single-CEL glycations at Lys-28 of A1- 42 had the least impact on fibril formation, whereas CEL glycations at Lys-16 of A1- 42 delayed fibril formation. We also tested these peptides for neuronal toxicity and mitochondrial function on a retinoic acid-differentiated SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (RA-differentiated SH-SY5Y). Only A-CEL16 and A-CEL28 were neurotoxic, possibly through a nonmitochondrial pathway, whereas A-CEL16&28 showed no neurotoxicity. Interestingly, A-CEL16&28 had depolarized the mitochondrial membrane potential, whereas A-CEL16 had increased mitochondrial respiration at complex II. These results may indicate mitophagy or an alternate route of metabolism, respectively. Therefore, our results provides insight into potential therapeutic approaches against neurotoxic CEL-glycated A1-42. ? 2019 Ng et al.

"Impact of an interatrial shunt device on survival and heart failure hospitalization in patients with preserved ejection fraction",2019,"Aims: Impaired left ventricular diastolic function leading to elevated left atrial pressures, particularly during exertion, is a key driver of symptoms and outcomes in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Insertion of an interatrial shunt device (IASD) to reduce left atrial pressure in HFpEF has been shown to be associated with short-term haemodynamic and symptomatic benefit. We aimed to investigate the potential effects of IASD placement on HFpEF survival and heart failure hospitalization (HFH). Methods and results: Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction patients participating in the Reduce Elevated Left Atrial Pressure in Patients with Heart Failure study (Corvia Medical) of an IASD were followed for a median duration of 739?days. The theoretical impact of IASD implantation on HFpEF mortality was investigated by comparing the observed survival of the study cohort with the survival predicted from baseline data using the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure heart failure risk survival score. Baseline and post-IASD implant parameters associated with HFH were also investigated. Based upon the individual baseline demographic and cardiovascular profile of the study cohort, the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score-predicted mortality was 10.2/100?pt?years. The observed mortality rate of the IASD-treated cohort was 3.4/100?pt?years, representing a 33% lower rate (P?=?0.02). By Kaplan–Meier analysis, the observed survival in IASD patients was greater than predicted (P?=?0.014). Baseline parameters were not predictive of future HFH events; however, poorer exercise tolerance and a higher workload-corrected exercise pulmonary capillary wedge pressure at the 6?months post-IASD study were associated with HFH. Conclusions: The current study suggests IASD implantation may be associated with a reduction in mortality in HFpEF. Large-scale ongoing randomized studies are required to confirm the potential benefit of this therapy. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Anticancer Characteristics of Fomitopsis pinicola Extract in a Xenograft Mouse Model—a Preliminary Study",2019,"Introduction: Medicinal mushrooms have been used for the treatment of diseases and general promotion of health for many centuries. Recent pharmacological research into medicinal mushrooms has identified various therapeutic properties, with applications in modern medicine. Aim: To evaluate the anti-cancer activities of Fomitopsis pinicola (F. pinicola) alcoholic extract in an in vivo setting. Methods: The anti-tumour effect of the F. pinicola extract was tested in a xenograft immune-compromised Rag-1 mouse model. This was followed by RT-PCR and metabolomics analyses. Results: There were no observable differences in tumor growth between treated and non-treated groups. The bioactive components were not detected in the mouse plasma or the tumor site. Conclusions: The extract was poorly absorbed; this is likely due to the timing of treatment, dosage levels and modifications made to the extract where the alcohol-based solvent was replaced with water. This, in combination with fractionation studies which identified most anti-cancer compounds to be hydrophobic, largely explained the lack of anti-cancer activities in vivo. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Assessment of drugs of abuse in a wastewater treatment plant with parallel secondary wastewater treatment train",2019,"In this study, 24-hour composite wastewater samples were collected from a wastewater treatment plant of New Zealand with parallel secondary treatment units. The aim was to investigate the occurrence, removal, and consumption of 13 drugs of abuse (DOAs) including illicit drugs, alcohol, nicotine, and their metabolites. The filtered samples were analysed through direct injection on LC-MS/MS. Ethyl sulfate, one of the major metabolites of alcohol, was detected at the highest concentration (mean = 8300 ng/L) in wastewater influent. The mean concentrations of methamphetamine and hydroxycotinine in the influent were found to be 935 ng/L and 5000 ng/L, respectively. Amphetamine (383 ng/L) and cocaine (286 ng/L) were detected at the highest concentrations in the effluent. The removal efficiency of the treatment plant varied for DOAs: >99% for morphine, ethyl sulfate, and hydroxycotinine and <50% for methadone and 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3,3-diphenylpyrrolidine (EDDP). Primary treatment did not show any significant removal of DOAs while the removal efficiencies of total monitored DOAs by Membrane Bioreactor (MBR) and Bardenpho processes were found to be similar (~95% removal). The population was estimated using hydrochemical parameters and human urine biomarkers and showed good agreement with wastewater treatment plant's estimates. Weekday-weekend variation in the consumption of alcohol and methamphetamine was found to be significant, with a higher estimated consumption during the weekends. Monitored DOAs in influent were present at highest concentrations during summer (23 μg/L), at low concentrations during winter (17 μg/L), and at lowest concentrations during heavy rainfall event (11 μg/L), possibly due to dilution. The population normalised mass loads of DOAs were found to correlate with their metabolites, and morphine was found to correlate with nicotine metabolites. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Alcohols; Biomolecules; Bioreactors; Direct injection; Drug products; Efficiency; Effluents; Metabolites; Nicotine; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater; Water treatment plants; Hydrochemical parameters; Illicit drug; Mean concentrations; Membrane bio reactor (MBR); Occurrence and fate; Removal efficiencies; Secondary treatment; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; 2 ethylidene 1,5 dimethyl 3,3 diphenylpyrrolidine; alcohol; amphetamine; benzoylecgonine; biological marker; cocaine; codeine; ethyl sulfate; hydroxycotinine; illicit drug; methadone; methamphetamine; midomafetamine; morphine; nicotine; rain; unclassified drug; street drug; alcoholic beverage; drug; drug user; metabolite; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; alcohol consumption; Article; Bardenpho process; concentration (parameters); controlled study; correlation analysis; dilution; drug abuse; drugs of abuse; environmental parameters; human; hydrochemical parameters; limit of detection; liquid chromatography; metabolite; New Zealand; parallel secondary wastewater treatment train; population size; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer; tandem mass spectrometry; urban area; urinalysis; waste component removal; waste water quality; waste water treatment plant; water quality; winter; analysis; environmental monitoring; procedures; sewage; substance abuse; waste water; water pollutant; New Zealand; Chromatography, Liquid; Environmental Monitoring; New Zealand; Street Drugs; Substance Abuse Detection; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical"
"Neonatal Glycaemia and Neurodevelopmental Outcomes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2019,"Background: Hypoglycaemia is the most common metabolic problem in neonates but there is no universally accepted threshold for safe blood glucose concentrations due to uncertainty regarding effects on neurodevelopment. Objective: To systematically assess the association between neonatal hypoglycaemia on neurodevelopment outcomes in childhood and adolescence. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO from inception until February 2018. We included studies that reported one or more prespecified outcomes and compared children exposed to neonatal hypoglycaemia with children not exposed. Studies of neonates with congenital malformations, inherited metabolic disorders and congenital hyperinsulinism were excluded. Two authors independently extracted data using a customized form. We used ROBINS-I to assess risk of bias, GRADE for quality of evidence, and REVMAN for meta-analysis (inverse variance, fixed effects). Results: 1,665 studies were screened, 61 reviewed in full, and 11 included (12 publications). In early childhood, exposure to neonatal hypoglycaemia was not associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (n = 1,657 infants; OR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.86-1.57) but was associated with visual-motor impairment (n = 508; OR = 3.46, 95% CI = 1.13-10.57) and executive dysfunction (n = 463; OR = 2.50, 95% CI = 1.20-5.22). In mid-childhood, neonatal hypoglycaemia was associated with neurodevelopmental impairment (n = 54; OR = 3.62, 95% CI = 1.05-12.42) and low literacy (n = 1,395; OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.20-3.47) and numeracy (n = 1,395; OR = 2.04, 95% CI = 1.21-3.44). No data were available for adolescents. Conclusions: Neonatal hypoglycaemia may have important long-lasting adverse effects on neurodevelopment that may become apparent at later ages. Carefully designed randomized trials are required to determine the optimal management of neonates at risk of hypoglycaemia with long-term follow-up at least to school age. ? 2018 S.

"Structure-activity relationships for unit C pyridyl analogues of the tuberculosis drug bedaquiline",2019,"The ATP-synthase inhibitor bedaquiline is effective against drug-resistant tuberculosis but is extremely lipophilic (clogP 7.25) with a very long plasma half-life. Additionally, inhibition of potassium current through the cardiac hERG channel by bedaquiline, is associated with prolongation of the QT interval, necessitating cardiovascular monitoring. Analogues were prepared where the naphthalene C-unit was replaced with substituted pyridines to produce compounds with reduced lipophilicity, anticipating a reduction in half-life. While there was a direct correlation between in vitro inhibitory activity against M. tuberculosis (MIC 90 ) and compound lipophilicity, potency only fell off sharply below a clogP of about 4.0, providing a useful lower bound for analogue design. The bulk of the compounds remained potent inhibitors of the hERG potassium channel, with notable exceptions where IC 50 values were at least 5-fold higher than that of bedaquiline. Many of the compounds had desirably higher rates of clearance than bedaquiline, but this was associated with lower plasma exposures in mice, and similar or higher MICs resulted in lower AUC/MIC ratios than bedaquiline for most compounds. The two compounds with lower potency against hERG exhibited similar clearance to bedaquiline and excellent efficacy in vivo, suggesting further exploration of C-ring pyridyls is worthwhile. ? 2019 The Authors","1 (7 bromo 3 methoxynaphthalen 2 yl) 1 (2,3 dimethoxyphenyl) 4 (dimethylamino) 2 (2,6 dimethylpyridin 4 yl)butan 2 ol; 7 [1 (2,3 dimethoxyphenyl) 4 (dimethylamino) 2 (2,6 dimethylpyridin 4 yl) 2 hydroxybutyl] 6 methoxy 2 naphthonitrile; bedaquiline; bedaquiline derivative; potassium channel HERG; tuberculostatic agent; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal experiment; antibacterial activity; area under the curve; Article; chemical modification; controlled study; crystal structure; drug bioavailability; drug clearance; drug efficacy; drug exposure; drug half life; drug potency; drug structure; drug synthesis; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipophilicity; liver microsome; MIC90; mouse; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; physical chemistry; structure activity relation; Vero cell line; volume of distribution"
"Contribution of Human Hair in Solar UV Transmission in Skin: Implications for Melanoma Development",2019,"Melanoma is the deadliest type of skin cancer with its prevalence on the rise. Recently, the melanocyte stem cells in hair follicles have been identified as the possible origin of melanoma upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) through skin. It is hypothesized that colourless vellus hair (predominant in childhood) can serve as an alternative pathway in transmitting these ultraviolet (UV) photons to the stem cells. To investigate this, we have used the CRAIC microspectrophotometer to investigate the optical properties of ‘vellus-like’ hairs and terminal hairs of different colours using UV–VIS–NIR light sources. It was found that the average attenuation coefficient of ‘vellus-like’ hair is significantly lower than that of terminal hair in the UVA (p < 0.0001) and UVB (p < 0.001) wavelength ranges. Next, the optical properties of hairs are applied to simulations for examining their influence on UV transmission into the skin. The results show that the presence of vellus hair would increase the solar UV transmission to the melanocyte stem cell layer significantly. The findings explain why children are particularly vulnerable to sun exposure and the positive correlation found between the incidence of melanoma in adults’ bodies and the number of vellus hairs in these areas. ? 2019, Biomedical Engineering Society.","Cytology; Dermatology; Diseases; Intelligent systems; Light sources; Monte Carlo methods; Oncology; Optical properties; Radiotherapy; Ultraviolet radiation; Attenuation coefficient; Medulla; Melanocyte stem cells; Melanoma; Microspectrophotometry; Skin cancers; Tissue optic; Vellus hair; Stem cells; adult; Article; child; female; hair; hair color; human; human tissue; infrared radiation; male; melanocyte; melanoma; microspectrophotometry; Monte Carlo method; optics; priority journal; radiation attenuation; solar radiation; stem cell; sun exposure; terminal hair; ultraviolet A radiation; ultraviolet B radiation; ultraviolet radiation; vellus hair"
"Treat-to-target in rheumatoid arthritis: Evaluating the patient perspective using the Patient Opinion Real-Time Anonymous Liaison system: The RA T2T PORTAL study",2019,"Objectives: To determine the level of agreement among patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with the principles and recommendations of the treat-to-target (T2T) initiative in New Zealand (NZ) and to further explore specific patient opinions via online iterative surveys. Methods: Participants with RA were recruited from rheumatology clinics in NZ and invited to receive and reply to surveys administered via the Patient Opinion Real-Time Anonymous Liaison (PORTAL) system. An enrolment survey recorded demographics, disease duration and treatment and then RA T2T surveys were administered weekly. A Likert scale 1-5 measured agreement with the principles and recommendations and further surveys explored responses of interest identified by investigators from each prior survey. Results: One hundred and ninety patients consented to participate in PORTAL and 132 in the RA T2T surveys. Level of agreement with RA T2T principles was: 93.3% to 99.3% and to the recommendations: 77.3%-100%. The lowest level of agreement 77.3% was with recommendation 8, 3 monthly treatment adjustment, and the highest was 100% agreement with recommendation 10, shared decision-making. Patients agreed less with low disease activity as the target compared with remission (91.4% and 98%). Despite high-level agreement for the use of a disease activity score (95.7%), 23% did not feel the individual components reflected their disease control. Patients rated difficulty coping, erosions on imaging, health-related quality of life and pain all significantly higher than C-reactive protein as indicators of worsening arthritis. Conclusions: Despite a high level of patient agreement with RA T2T this study highlights the importance of patient engagement in the RA T2T process to individualize therapy adjustments, make shared decisions and decide on targets that accurately reflect disease control according to patients. ? 2019 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","C reactive protein; antirheumatic agent; adult; Article; cohort analysis; coping behavior; demography; disease activity score; disease control; disease duration; disease severity; female; health survey; human; Likert scale; major clinical study; male; middle aged; New Zealand; online system; patient attitude; patient compliance; pilot study; priority journal; quality of life; remission; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatology; shared decision making; treatment duration; aged; cost of illness; disease exacerbation; health care survey; nociception; patient participation; patient satisfaction; patient-reported outcome; practice guideline; psychology; rheumatoid arthritis; time factor; treatment outcome; Adaptation, Psychological; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Cost of Illness; Disease Progression; Female; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Outcome and Process Assessment, Health Care; Pain Perception; Patient Participation; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Patient Satisfaction; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality of Life; Remission Induction; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"The Efficacy of Preschool Developmental Indicators as a Screen for Early Primary School-Based Literacy Interventions",2020,"Literacy success lays the foundation for children's later educational, health, and well-being outcomes. Thus, early identification of literacy need is vital. Using data from New Zealand's national preschool health screening program for fiscal years 2010/2011–2014/2015, demographic and health variables from 255,090 children aged 4?years were related to whether they received a literacy intervention in early primary school. Overall, 20,652 (8.1%) children received an intervention. Time-to-event analysis revealed that all considered variables were significantly related to literacy intervention (all p?<.01), but the full model lacked reasonable predictive power for population screening purposes (Harrell's c-statistic?=.624; 95% CI [.618,.629]). Including more direct literacy measures in the national screening program is likely needed for improvement. ? 2018 Society for Research in Child Development","article; child; controlled study; female; human; literacy; major clinical study; male; mass screening; New Zealand; preschool child; primary school; wellbeing"

Difference plots and regressions were used to aid interpretation around 40 and 50 mmol/mol, the cut-offs used to identify “pre-diabetes” and diabetes in New Zealand. Results: After initial acceptable tests, subsequent batches delivered POC results that varied from laboratory HbA 1c by +6 to ?14 mmol/mol around the clinical cut-offs. Ten faulty batches of discs were recalled worldwide. POC testing was suspended in one region, as was the planned trial. The manufacturing defect was rectified, accuracy of the new batches was confirmed, and testing resumed. Conclusion: POC testing must be conducted within stringent quality assurance processes prior to and while in use. Within such a system, POC testing for HbA 1c can be sufficiently accurate for screening and diagnosis of diabetes. ? 2018 Primary Care Diabetes Europe","hemoglobin A1c; biological marker; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; Article; capillary blood; cardiovascular disease; community care; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; hemoglobin blood level; measurement accuracy; New Zealand; patient safety; point of care testing; priority journal; screening; total quality management; venous blood; blood; community care; diabetes mellitus; health care quality; human; mass screening; observer variation; point of care system; point of care testing; predictive value; quality control; reproducibility; standards; total quality management; Biomarkers; Community Health Services; Diabetes Mellitus; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Mass Screening; New Zealand; Observer Variation; Point-of-Care Systems; Point-of-Care Testing; Predictive Value of Tests; Quality Control; Quality Improvement; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Reproducibility of Results"
"The first INFORMAS national food environments and policies survey in New Zealand: A blueprint country profile for measuring progress on creating healthy food environments",2019,"The International Network for Food and Obesity/NCDs Research, Monitoring and Action Support aims to benchmark national food environments. This study proposes a blueprint country profile to measure progress on creating healthy food environments, based on the results of the first, comprehensive survey in New Zealand (NZ). We assessed the implementation of national food environment policies and food industry commitments to improve population nutrition and the strength and comprehensiveness of public sector settings' nutrition policies. The healthiness of the packaged food supply, including health-related labelling, was evaluated. Food environments were measured in 833 schools, 204 supermarkets, 1500 takeaway outlets, 28 hospitals, 70 sport centres, and around all NZ schools. Food swamps, defined as areas with high relative density of unhealthy food outlets, were identified, and food marketing to children on television, websites, social media and packages, in magazines, and in and around schools was measured. The cost differential between healthy and current household diets was calculated for different population groups. NZ's food environment profile is largely unhealthy, and there are inequalities in access to healthy food environments. It is anticipated that the proposed country profile can help other countries tackle unhealthy food environments through increasing accountability of governments and the industry. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation","Article; catering service; environmental factor; food industry; food packaging; government; health care access; health care cost; health care disparity; healthy diet; household; human; marketing; New Zealand; nutrition policy; obesity; public health; public sector; relative density; social media"
"Determining microbial roles in ecosystem function: Redefining microbial food webs and transcending kingdom barriers",2019,"Microorganisms can have a profound and varying effect on the chemical character of environments and, thereby, ecological health. Their capacity to consume or transform contaminants leads to contrasting outcomes, such as the dissipation of nutrient pollution via denitrification, the breakdown of spilled oil, or eutrophication via primary producer overgrowth. Recovering the genomes of organisms directly from the environment is useful to gain insights into resource usage, in-terspecies collaborations (producers and consumers), and trait acquisition. Microbial data can also be considered alongside the broader biological character of an environment through the co-recovery of eukaryotic DNA. The contributions of individual microorganisms (bacteria, archaea, and protists) to snapshots of ecosystem processes can be determined by integrating genomics with functional methods. This combined approach enables a detailed understanding of how microbial communities drive biogeochemical cycles, and although currently limited by scale, key attributes can be effectively extrapolated with lower-resolution methods to determine wider ecological relevance.

"Allelic Imbalance of Recurrently Mutated Genes in Acute Myeloid Leukaemia",2019,"The patho-mechanism of somatic driver mutations in cancer usually involves transcription, but the proportion of mutations and wild-type alleles transcribed from DNA to RNA is largely unknown. We systematically compared the variant allele frequencies of recurrently mutated genes in DNA and RNA sequencing data of 246 acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients. We observed that 95% of all detected variants were transcribed while the rest were not detectable in RNA sequencing with a minimum read-depth cut-off (10x). Our analysis focusing on 11 genes harbouring recurring mutations demonstrated allelic imbalance (AI) in most patients. GATA2, RUNX1, TET2, SRSF2, IDH2, PTPN11, WT1, NPM1 and CEBPA showed significant AIs. While the effect size was small in general, GATA2 exhibited the largest allelic imbalance. By pooling heterogeneous data from three independent AML cohorts with paired DNA and RNA sequencing (N = 253), we could validate the preferential transcription of GATA2-mutated alleles. Differential expression analysis of the genes with significant AI showed no significant differential gene and isoform expression for the mutated genes, between mutated and wild-type patients. In conclusion, our analyses identified AI in nine out of eleven recurrently mutated genes. AI might be a common phenomenon in AML which potentially contributes to leukaemogenesis. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

"Patellofemoral cartilage stresses are most sensitive to variations in vastus medialis muscle forces",2019,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of variations in quadriceps muscle forces on patellofemoral stress. We created subject-specific finite element models for 21 individuals with chronic patellofemoral pain and 16 pain-free control subjects. We extracted three-dimensional geometries from high resolution magnetic resonance images and registered the geometries to magnetic resonance images from an upright weight bearing squat with the knees flexed at 60°. We estimated quadriceps muscle forces corresponding to 60° knee flexion during a stair climb task from motion analysis and electromyography-driven musculoskeletal modelling. We applied the quadriceps muscle forces to our finite element models and evaluated patellofemoral cartilage stress. We quantified cartilage stress using an energy-based effective stress, a scalar quantity representing the local stress intensity in the tissue. We used probabilistic methods to evaluate the effects of variations in quadriceps muscle forces from five trials of the stair climb task for each subject. Patellofemoral effective stress was most sensitive to variations in forces in the two branches of the vastus medialis muscle. Femur cartilage effective stress was most sensitive to variations in vastus medialis forces in 29/37 (78%) subjects, and patella cartilage effective stress was most sensitive to variations in vastus medialis forces in 21/37 (57%) subjects. Femur cartilage effective stress was more sensitive to variations in vastus medialis longus forces in subjects classified as maltrackers compared to normal tracking subjects (p = 0.006). This study provides new evidence of the importance of the vastus medialis muscle in the treatment of patellofemoral pain. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Bone; Cartilage; Health; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Muscle; Physiological models; Stairs; Finite element modelling; Patellofemoral; Probabilistic modelling; quadriceps force; Vastus medialis; Finite element method; anatomical variation; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; bone microarchitecture; bone stress; clinical article; cohort analysis; controlled study; electromyography; female; femoral head cartilage; goniometry; hemodynamics; human; isometric exercise; knee injury; knee ligament; knee pain; Knee Pain Score; kyphosis; male; muscle strength; nerve block; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; osteoarthritis; pain assessment; patella dislocation; patellofemoral joint; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; questionnaire; range of motion; rectus femoris muscle; tibialis anterior muscle; vastus medialis muscle; adult; articular cartilage; biological model; biomechanics; computer simulation; femur; finite element analysis; joint characteristics and functions; mechanical stress; patella; patellofemoral pain syndrome; pathology; pathophysiology; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cartilage, Articular; Computer Simulation; Female; Femur; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Models, Biological; Patella; Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome; Quadriceps Muscle; Range of Motion, Articular; Stress, Mechanical"
"Diverticulosis and nine connective tissue disorders: epidemiological support for an association",2019,"Purpose: An underlying connective tissue disorder (CTD)?may predispose to formation of intestinal diverticula. We assess the association of diverticulosis with nine selected CTDs, to inform the pathophysiology of diverticula. Methods: A population-based period-prevalence study. Individuals (3.5 million New Zealand residents born 1901–1986) with a health system record 1999–2016 were grouped into those with a hospital diagnosis of diverticulosis or diverticulitis (ICD-10-AM K57), and those without. Also recorded were any hospital diagnoses of nine selected CTDs. The association of exposure to diverticulosis and each CTD was assessed using logistic regressions adjusted for age, gender, ethnicity and region. Results: In all, 85,958 (2.4%) people had a hospital diagnosis of diverticulosis. Hospitalisation with diverticulosis was highly significantly associated with rectal prolapse (adjusted odds ratio [OR]?=?3.9), polycystic kidney disease (OR?=?3.8), heritable syndromes (Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos) (OR?=?2.4), female genital prolapse (OR?=?2.3), non-aortic aneurysm (OR?=?2.3), aortic aneurysm (OR?=?2.2), inguinal hernia (OR?=?1.9) and dislocations of shoulder and other joints (OR?=?1.7), but not subarachnoid haemorrhage (OR?=?1.0). Conclusion: People with diverticulosis are more likely to have colonic extracellular matrix (ECM)/connective tissue alterations in anatomical areas other than the bowel, suggesting linked ECM/connective tissue pathology. Although biases may exist, the results indicate large-scale integrated studies are needed to investigate underlying genetic pathophysiology of colonic diverticula, together with fundamental biological studies to investigate cellular phenotypes and ECM changes. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; age; aged; aneurysm; aortic aneurysm; Article; carotid artery aneurysm; colon diverticulosis; comparative study; connective tissue disease; disease association; Ehlers Danlos syndrome; ethnicity; female; gender; geographic distribution; high risk population; hospitalization; human; iliac artery aneurysm; inguinal hernia; joint dislocation; kidney polycystic disease; major clinical study; male; Marfan syndrome; middle aged; New Zealand; observational study; pathophysiology; pelvic organ prolapse; population research; prevalence; rectum prolapse; renal artery aneurysm; sensitivity analysis; shoulder dislocation; subarachnoid hemorrhage"
"A single discrete Rab5-binding site in phosphoinositide 3-kinase is required for tumor cell invasion",2019,"Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is regulated by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), G protein– coupled receptors (GPCRs), and small GTPases such as Rac1 and Rab5. Our lab previously identified two residues (Gln596 and Ile597) in the helical domain of the catalytic subunit (p110) of PI3K whose mutation disrupts binding to Rab5. To better define the Rab5–p110 interface, we performed alanine-scanning mutagenesis and analyzed Rab5 binding with an in vitro pulldown assay with GST-Rab5GTP. Of the 35 p110 helical domain mutants assayed, 11 disrupted binding to Rab5 without affecting Rac1 binding, basal lipid kinase activity, or G-stimulated kinase activity. These mutants defined the Rab5-binding interface within p110 as consisting of two perpendicular -helices in the helical domain that are adjacent to the initially identified Gln596 and Ile597 residues. Analysis of the Rab5–PI3K interaction by hydrogen-deuterium exchange MS identified p110 peptides that overlap with these helices; no interactions were detected between Rab5 and other regions of p110 or p85. Similarly, the binding of Rab5 to isolated p85 could not be detected, and mutations in the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of p110 had no effect on Rab5 binding. Whereas soluble Rab5 did not affect PI3K activity in vitro, the interaction of these two proteins was critical for chemotaxis, invasion, and gelatin degradation by breast cancer cells. Our results define a single, discrete Rab5-binding site in the p110 helical domain, which may be useful for generating inhibitors to better define the physiological role of Rab5–PI3K coupling in vivo. ? 2019 Heitz et al.

"Fully Automatic Left Atrium Segmentation From Late Gadolinium Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging Using a Dual Fully Convolutional Neural Network",2019,"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most prevalent form of cardiac arrhythmia. Current treatments for AF remain suboptimal due to a lack of understanding of the underlying atrial structures that directly sustain AF. Existing approaches for analyzing atrial structures in 3-D, especially from late gadolinium-enhanced (LGE) magnetic resonance imaging, rely heavily on manual segmentation methods that are extremely labor-intensive and prone to errors. As a result, a robust and automated method for analyzing atrial structures in 3-D is of high interest. We have, therefore, developed AtriaNet, a 16-layer convolutional neural network (CNN), on 154 3-D LGE-MRIs with a spatial resolution of 0.625 mm × 0.625 mm × 1.25 mm from patients with AF, to automatically segment the left atrial (LA) epicardium and endocardium. AtriaNet consists of a multi-scaled, dual-pathway architecture that captures both the local atrial tissue geometry and the global positional information of LA using 13 successive convolutions and three further convolutions for merging. By utilizing computationally efficient batch prediction, AtriaNet was able to successfully process each 3-D LGE-MRI within 1 min. Furthermore, benchmarking experiments have shown that AtriaNet has outperformed the state-of-the-art CNNs, with a DICE score of 0.940 and 0.942 for the LA epicardium and endocardium, respectively, and an inter-patient variance of &lt;0.001. The estimated LA diameter and volume computed from the automatic segmentations were accurate to within 1.59 mm and 4.01 cm 3 of the ground truths. Our proposed CNN was tested on the largest known data set for LA segmentation, and to the best of our knowledge, it is the most robust approach that has ever been developed for segmenting LGE-MRIs. The increased accuracy of atrial reconstruction and analysis could potentially improve the understanding and treatment of AF. ? 2018 IEEE.","Convolution; Deep learning; Diseases; Gadolinium; Heart; Image segmentation; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; Neural networks; Personnel training; Structural analysis; Atrial fibrillation; Automatic segmentations; Classification algorithm; Computationally efficient; Convolutional neural network; Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN); Manual segmentation; Positional information; Three dimensional displays; gadolinium chelate; gadolinium; Article; atrial fibrillation; endocardium; epicardium; heart left atrium; human; image reconstruction; image segmentation; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; algorithm; diagnostic imaging; heart atrium; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; three dimensional imaging; Algorithms; Atrial Fibrillation; Gadolinium; Heart Atria; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Networks, Computer"

"Cerebellar degeneration correlates with motor symptoms in Huntington disease",2019,"Objective: Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized by variable motor and behavioral symptoms attributed to major neuropathology of mainly the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex. The role of the cerebellum, a brain region involved in the coordination of movements, in HD neuropathology has been controversial. This study utilizes postmortem human brain tissue to investigate whether Purkinje cell degeneration in the neocerebellum is present in HD, and how this relates to disease symptom profiles. Methods: Unbiased stereological counting methods were used to quantify the total number of Purkinje cells in 15 HD cases and 8 neurologically normal control cases. Based on their predominant symptoms, the HD cases were categorized into 2 groups: “motor” or “mood.”. Results: The results demonstrated a significant 43% loss of Purkinje cells in HD cases with predominantly motor symptoms, and no cell loss in cases showing a major mood phenotype. There was no significant correlation between Purkinje cell loss and striatal neuropathological grade, postmortem delay, CAG repeat in the IT15 gene, or age at death. Interpretation: This study shows a compelling relationship between Purkinje cell loss in the HD neocerebellum and the HD motor symptom phenotype, which, together with our previous human brain studies on the same HD cases, provides novel perspectives interrelating and correlating the variable cerebellar, basal ganglia, and neocortical neuropathology with the variability of motor/mood symptom profiles in the human HD brain.

"Trends in the incidence of testing for Vitamin D deficiency in primary care in the UK: A retrospective analysis of the Health Improvement Network (THIN), 2005-2015",2019,"Objective To investigate trends in the incidence of testing for vitamin D deficiency and the prevalence of patients with circulating concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) indicative of deficiency (<30 nmol/L) between 2005 and 2015. Design Longitudinal analysis of electronic health records in The Health Improvement Network primary care database. Setting UK primary care. Intervention None. Participants The analysis included 6 416 709 participants aged 18 years and older. Primary outcomes Incidence of having a blood test for vitamin D deficiency between 2005 and 2015, the prevalence with blood 25(OH)D <30 nmol/L and the effects of age, ethnicity and socioeconomic status on these measures were assessed. Results After a mean follow-up time of 5.4 (SD 3.7) years, there were 210 502 patients tested for vitamin D deficiency. The incidence of vitamin D testing rose from 0.29 per 1000 person-years at risk (PYAR) (95% CI 0.27 to 0.31) in 2005 to 16.1 per 1000 PYAR (95% CI 15.9 to 16.2) in 2015. Being female, older, non-white ethnicity and more economically deprived were all strongly associated with being tested. One-third (n=69 515) had 25(OH)D <30 nmol/L, but the per cent deficient among ethnic minority groups ranged from 43% among mixed ethnicity to 66% in Asians. Being male, younger and more economically deprived were also all associated with vitamin D deficiency (p<0.001). Conclusions Testing for vitamin D deficiency increased over the past decade among adults in the UK. One-third of UK adults who had a vitamin D test performed in primary care were vitamin D deficient, and deficiency was much higher among ethnic minority patients. Future research should focus on strategies to ensure population intake of vitamin D, particularly in at-risk groups, meets recommendations to reduce the risk of deficiency and need for testing. ?

"The effect of olive leaf extract on upper respiratory illness in high school athletes: A randomised control trial",2019,"Upper respiratory illness (URI) has a major impact on both training and competition in an athletic setting. High school athletes are a sub?-category who have reported higher illness rates than professional and sub?-elite high school athletes of the same sport. Olive leaf extract (OLE) is an over-the?-counter supplement that contains polyphenols, notably oleuropein and hydroxytyrosol, that have antiviral, antibacterial, anti?-inflammatory and antioxidant properties that may reduce URI rates. Thirty?-two high school students who play sport for the elite team at their school were recruited to a randomised controlled trial and allocated to a daily placebo or OLE (extent equivalent to 20 g of olive leaf, containing 100 mg oleuropein) supplementation for nine weeks during their competitive season. Twice weekly measures of wellbeing, training load and respiratory illness (sporting upper respiratory illness (SUPPRESS) questionnaire) were recorded at trainings, meetings or games. There was no significant difference in illness incidence (odds ratio (OR): 1.02 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.21–4.44)), but there was a significant 28% reduction in sick days (OR: 0.72 (95% CI 0.56–0.93) p?-value = 0.02) when supplemented with OLE. The dietary intakes of the athletes were sub?-optimal with regard to immune support. OLE supplementation over a season did not significantly reduce URI incidence, but did decrease duration in high school athletes, potentially aiding return to play. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Associations between maternal age at menarche and anthropometric and metabolic parameters in the adolescent offspring",2019,"Objective: We examined the associations between maternal age at menarche and anthropometry and metabolism in adolescent offspring. Methods: Anthropometric, metabolic and blood pressure data were obtained from 304 girls and 190 boys aged 11-16?years attending school in Hangzhou (China). Age at menarche for both mothers and daughters was self-reported. Fasting blood samples were obtained and all participants underwent clinical examinations. Obesity was defined as BMI ?95th percentile for age and sex. Results: Older maternal age at menarche was associated with older age of their daughters at menarche (r?=?0.21; P?<?0.001). Mother's age at menarche was not associated with anthropometry or metabolism of daughters. However, younger maternal age at menarche was associated with increased hip and waist circumferences, and BMI SDS of their sons. Boys whose mothers were ?13?years at menarche had an adjusted relative risk of obesity 3-fold greater than sons of mothers with a later menarcheal onset (2.96; 95% CI 1.49, 5.87). Among daughters, every 1-year increase in their age at menarche was associated with a 0.34 SDS reduction in BMI. Increasing age at menarche was also associated with reduced waist and hip circumferences (?1.5 and ?1.8?cm/y, respectively) and waist-to-height ratio (?0.008 per year). Girls in the youngest menarcheal age tertile (8.8-11.6?years) had diastolic blood pressure 2.2?mm Hg higher than other girls (P?=?0.029). Conclusions: Younger maternal age at menarche is associated with increased obesity risk in their sons, but not daughters. However, girls who experience menarche earlier have a less favourable anthropometric profile. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"Maternal and fetal genetic effects on birth weight and their relevance to cardio-metabolic risk factors",2019,"Birth weight variation is influenced by fetal and maternal genetic and non-genetic factors, and has been reproducibly associated with future cardio-metabolic health outcomes. In expanded genome-wide association analyses of own birth weight (n = 321,223) and offspring birth weight (n = 230,069 mothers), we identified 190 independent association signals (129 of which are novel). We used structural equation modeling to decompose the contributions of direct fetal and indirect maternal genetic effects, then applied Mendelian randomization to illuminate causal pathways. For example, both indirect maternal and direct fetal genetic effects drive the observational relationship between lower birth weight and higher later blood pressure: maternal blood pressure-raising alleles reduce offspring birth weight, but only direct fetal effects of these alleles, once inherited, increase later offspring blood pressure. Using maternal birth weight-lowering genotypes to proxy for an adverse intrauterine environment provided no evidence that it causally raises offspring blood pressure, indicating that the inverse birth weight–blood pressure association is attributable to genetic effects, and not to intrauterine programming. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","allele; article; birth weight; blood pressure monitoring; cardiometabolic risk; controlled study; decomposition; female; fetus; genome-wide association study; genotype; human; major clinical study; maternal blood; Mendelian randomization analysis; progeny; randomized controlled trial; structural equation modeling; uterus; adult; biological model; birth weight; blood pressure; body height; fetomaternal transfusion; fetus development; genetic predisposition; genetics; heart disease; male; maternal inheritance; meta analysis; metabolic disorder; newborn; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pregnancy; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; Birth Weight; Blood Pressure; Body Height; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Fetal Development; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Heart Diseases; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Maternal Inheritance; Maternal-Fetal Exchange; Metabolic Diseases; Models, Genetic; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Pregnancy; Risk Factors"
"Prolonged postoperative ileus significantly increases the cost of inpatient stay for patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery: Results of a multivariate analysis of prospective data at a single institution",2019,"BACKGROUND: Prolonged postoperative ileus is a common major complication after abdominal surgery. Retrospective data suggest that ileus doubles the cost of inpatient stay. However, current economic impact data are based on retrospective studies that rely on clinical coding to diagnose ileus. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the economic burden of ileus for patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. DESIGN: Economic data were audited from a prospective database of patients who underwent surgery at Auckland City Hospital between September 2012 and June 2014. SETTINGS: Auckland City Hospital is a large tertiary referral center, using an enhanced recovery after surgery protocol. PATIENTS: Patients were prospectively diagnosed with prolonged postoperative ileus using a standardized definition. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The cost of inpatient stay was analyzed with regard to patient demographics and operative and postoperative factors. A multivariate analysis was performed to determine the cost of ileus when accounting for other significant covariates. RESULTS: Economic data were attained from 325 patients, and 88 patients (27%) developed ileus. The median inpatient cost (New Zealand dollars) for patients with prolonged ileus, including complication rates and length of stay, was $27,981 (interquartile range= $20,198 to $42,174) compared with $16,317 (interquartile range = $10,620 to $23,722) for other patients, a 71% increase in cost (p < 0.005). Ileus increased all associated healthcare costs, including medical/nursing care, radiology, medication, laboratory costs, and allied health (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis showed that ileus remained a significant financial burden (p < 0.005) when considering rates of major complications and length of stay. LIMITATIONS: This is a single-institution study, which may impact the generalizability of our results. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged ileus causes a substantial financial burden on the healthcare system, in addition to greater complication rates and length of stay in these patients. This is the first study to assess the financial impact of prolonged ileus, diagnosed prospectively using a standardized definition. ?

"Differential SLC6A4 methylation: a predictive epigenetic marker of adiposity from birth to adulthood",2019,"Background: The early life environment may influence susceptibility to obesity and metabolic disease in later life through epigenetic processes. SLC6A4 is an important mediator of serotonin bioavailability, and has a key role in energy balance. We tested the hypothesis that methylation of the SLC6A4 gene predicts adiposity across the life course. Methods: DNA methylation at 5 CpGs within the SLC6A4 gene identified from a previous methyl binding domain array was measured by pyrosequencing. We measured DNA methylation in umbilical cord (UC) from children in the Southampton Women’s Survey cohort (n = 680), in peripheral blood from adolescents in the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort Study (n = 812), and in adipose tissue from lean and obese adults from the UK BIOCLAIMS cohort (n = 81). Real-time PCR was performed to assess whether there were corresponding alterations in gene expression in the adipose tissue. Results: Lower UC methylation of CpG5 was associated with higher total fat mass at 4 years (p = 0.031), total fat mass at 6–7 years (p = 0.0001) and % fat mass at 6–7 years (p = 0.004). Lower UC methylation of CpG5 was also associated with higher triceps skinfold thickness at birth (p = 0.013), 6 months (p = 0.038), 12 months (p = 0.062), 2 years (p = 0.0003), 3 years (p = 0.00004) and 6–7 years (p = 0.013). Higher maternal pregnancy weight gain (p = 0.046) and lower parity (p = 0.029) were both associated with lower SLC6A4 CpG5 methylation. In adolescents, lower methylation of CpG5 in peripheral blood was associated with greater concurrent measures of adiposity including BMI (p ? 0.001), waist circumference (p = 0.011), subcutaneous fat (p ? 0.001) and subscapular, abdominal and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses (p = 0.002, p = 0.008, p = 0.004, respectively). In adipose tissue, methylation of both SLC6A4 CpG5 (p = 0.019) and expression of SLC6A4 (p = 0.008) was lower in obese compared with lean adults. Conclusions: These data suggest that altered methylation of CpG loci within SLC6A4 may provide a robust marker of adiposity across the life course. ? 2019, The Author(s).","genomic DNA; serotonin transporter; adipose tissue; adult; Article; birth weight; body mass; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; DNA methylation; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; epigenetics; fat mass; female; follow up; gene expression; genetic variation; gestational age; gestational weight gain; hip circumference; human; major clinical study; male; obesity; parity; priority journal; prospective study; pyrosequencing; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; skinfold thickness; subcutaneous fat; umbilical cord; waist circumference"
"Health literacy of future healthcare professionals: A cross-sectional study among health sciences students in Nepal",2019,"Background There is an assumption that health literacy is higher among health professionals, allowing them to improve the health literacy of their patients. This study explored health literacy profiles of health science students in Nepal, the future health professionals and educators of health literacy. Methods The multidimensional Health Literacy Questionnaire and demographic questions were administered online to medical and other health science students at the B. P. Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, Nepal. Results More than half (55.8%) of the participants were male, 68.3% were ?19 y of age, 62.2% had parents with a university degree, 73.5% were studying undergraduate courses and 61.6% were pursuing medicine. Students reported having moderate support and skills to manage their health. Health was regarded as important to them. They reported a moderate ability to engage with health professionals and the healthcare system. Medical students reported higher scores for all scales except social support for health, which was similar across the groups. Conclusions Universities should target interventions to improve students' access to health information and to develop students' ability to engage actively with healthcare providers. This will likely produce health professionals with improved health literacy levels who are sensitive to the health literacy needs of their patients from different population groups. ?

"Sleep duration and psychological well-being among New Zealanders",2019,"Objective: To identify the prevalence of short and long sleep duration and examine the relationship between sleep duration and psychological well-being among New Zealand adults. Design: Multiple regression using data from the New Zealand Attitudes Values Study postal questionnaire. Participants: New Zealand Attitudes Values Study respondents in 2014, 2015, and/or 2016 (Ns =15,820, 13,942, and 21,937). Measurements: Participants were asked, “During the past month, on average, how many hours of actual sleep did you get per night?” They also reported their demographic characteristics, physical and psychological health, and personality traits. Results: Most New Zealanders reported having optimal sleep duration (7 to <9 hours, 58%), but more than a third reported having short (<7 hours, 37%) and 4.5% reported long sleep duration (? 9 hours). M?ori and Pacific peoples showed particularly high rates of short sleepers. Compared to optimal sleep, short sleep consistently showed negative relationships with various measures of positive psychological well-being (eg, self-esteem, life satisfaction) independent of a broad range of demographic, health, and personality factors. Long sleep was only associated with an increased likelihood of depression. Personality traits, especially neuroticism, also showed strong associations with psychological well-being. Conclusions: The high proportion of short sleepers in New Zealand is a major issue of concern because short sleep showed consistent associations with negative psychological well-being. It is vital to implement sleep awareness campaigns and increase research on the reasons for short sleep among different groups. Given the ethnic disparity in sleep duration, target interventions for M?ori and Pacific peoples are particularly crucial. ? 2019 National Sleep Foundation.","adolescent; adult; aged; female; human; male; mental disease; middle aged; New Zealand; questionnaire; sleep; sleep deprivation; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Sleep; Sleep Deprivation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; Young Adult"
"Cerebral Vitamin B5 (D-Pantothenic Acid) Deficiency as a Potential Cause of Metabolic Perturbation and Neurodegeneration in Huntington’s Disease",2019,"Huntington’s disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded CAG repeat in exon 1 of the HTT gene. HD usually manifests in mid-life with loss of GABAergic projection neurons fromthe striatum accompanied by progressive atrophy of the putamen followed by other brain regions, but linkages between the genetics and neurodegeneration are not understood. We measured metabolic perturbations in HD-human brain in a case-control study, identifying pervasive lowering of vitamin B5, the obligatory precursor of coenzyme A (CoA) that is essential for normal intermediary metabolism. Cerebral pantothenate deficiency is a newly-identified metabolic defect in human HD that could potentially: (i) impair neuronal CoA biosynthesis; (ii) stimulate polyol-pathway activity; (iii) impair glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle activity; and (iv) modify brain-urea metabolism. Pantothenate deficiency could lead to neurodegeneration/dementia in HD that might be preventable by treatment with vitamin B5. ? 2019 Metabolites.

"Anti-PD-1 blockade with nivolumab with and without therapeutic vaccination for virally suppressed chronic hepatitis B: A pilot study",2019,"Background &amp; Aims: To evaluate the hypothesis that increasing T cell frequency and activity may provide durable control of hepatitis B virus (HBV), we administered nivolumab, a programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitor, with or without GS-4774, an HBV therapeutic vaccine, in virally suppressed patients with HBV e antigen (HBeAg)-negative chronic HBV. Methods: In a phase Ib study, patients received either a single dose of nivolumab at 0.1 mg/kg (n = 2) or 0.3 mg/kg (n = 12), or 40 yeast units of GS-4774 at baseline and week 4 and 0.3 mg/kg of nivolumab at week 4 (n = 10). The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change in HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) 12 weeks after nivolumab. Safety and immunologic changes were assessed through week 24. Results: There were no grade 3 or 4 adverse events or serious adverse events. All assessed patients retained T cell PD-1 receptor occupancy 6–12 weeks post-infusion, with a mean total across 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg cohorts of 76% (95% CI 75–77), and no significant differences were observed between cohorts (p = 0.839). Patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg nivolumab without and with GS-4774 had mean declines of ?0.30 (95% CI ?0.46 to ?0.14) and ?0.16 (95% CI ?0.33 to 0.01) log10 IU/ml, respectively. Patients showed significant HBsAg declines from baseline (p = 0.035) with 3 patients experiencing declines of &gt;0.5 log10 by the end of study. One patient, whose HBsAg went from baseline 1,173 IU/ml to undetectable at week 20, experienced an alanine aminotransferase flare (grade 3) at week 4 that resolved by week 8 and was accompanied by a significant increase in peripheral HBsAg-specific T cells at week 24. Conclusions: In virally suppressed HBeAg-negative patients, checkpoint blockade was well-tolerated and led to HBsAg decline in most patients and sustained HBsAg loss in 1 patient. Lay summary: Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) is characterized by a dysfunctional immune response. In patients with CHB, inhibitory receptors, such as programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) are overexpressed on T cells, leading to an ineffective immune response in the liver. Herein, we show that the PD-1 inhibitor, nivolumab, is safe and effective for the treatment of virally suppressed patients with CHB.

"Albuminuria: Population epidemiology and concordance in Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents",2019,"Objectives To describe the distribution of albuminuria among Australian children aged 11.12 years and their parents, and assess its intergenerational concordance within parent.child dyads. Design Population-based cross-sectional study (the Child Health CheckPoint), nested within the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Setting Assessment centres (seven Australian cities and eight regional towns) and home visits across Australia, February 2015 to March 2016. Participants Of all participating CheckPoint families (n=1874), 1557 children (46.2% girls) and 1454 parents (85.5% mothers) provided random urine samples at the visit; samples from menstruating females were excluded. Outcome measures Urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR) and its components (urine albumin and creatinine concentration); albuminuria was defined as an ACR .3.4 mg/mmol. Pearsonfs correlation coefficients and multivariable linear regression models assessed parent. child concordance, using log-transformed data due to skewing. Survey weights and methods were applied to account for the complex sample design. Results The median ACR for children was 1.03 mg/mmol (IQR 0.65.1.97) and 1.01 mg/mmol (IQR 0.60.2.09) for adults. The median ACR was higher in girls (1.20, IQR 0.71.2.65) than boys (0.90, IQR 0.61.1.65) and in mothers (1.13, IQR 0.63.2.33) than fathers (0.66, IQR 0.41.1.05). Albuminuria was detected in 15.1% of children (girls 20.8%, boys 10.1%) and 13.5% of adults (15.1% mothers, 4.0% fathers) had albuminuria. There was a small correlation between parent and child ACR (Pearson correlation coefficient 0.06, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.12). Conclusions Albuminuria is common among Australian children and adults, which is of concern because it predicts risk for kidney and cardiovascular disease, and mortality. The weak concordance among intergenerational pairs for urine ACR suggests either that genetic heritability is low or that it becomes evident only at later offspring life stages. ? 2019 Author(s).","albumin; creatinine; adult; albumin level; albuminuria; Article; Australian; child; child parent relation; creatinine urine level; cross-sectional study; father; female; human; hypertension; longitudinal study; macroalbuminuria; major clinical study; male; microalbuminuria; mother; obesity; population research; school child; sex difference; urine sampling"
"New Water-Soluble Copper(II) Complexes with Morpholine-Thiosemicarbazone Hybrids: Insights into the Anticancer and Antibacterial Mode of Action",2019,"Six morpholine-(iso)thiosemicarbazone hybrids HL 1 -HL 6 and their Cu(II) complexes with good-to-moderate solubility and stability in water were synthesized and characterized. Cu(II) complexes [Cu(L 1-6 )Cl] (1-6) formed weak dimeric associates in the solid state, which did not remain intact in solution as evidenced by ESI-MS. The lead proligands and Cu(II) complexes displayed higher antiproliferative activity in cancer cells than triapine. In addition, complexes 2-5 were found to specifically inhibit the growth of Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus with MIC 50 values at 2-5 μg/mL. Insights into the processes controlling intracellular accumulation and mechanism of action were investigated for 2 and 5, including the role of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) inhibition, endoplasmic reticulum stress induction, and regulation of other cancer signaling pathways. Their ability to moderately inhibit R2 RNR protein in the presence of dithiothreitol is likely related to Fe chelating properties of the proligands liberated upon reduction. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","antibiotic agent; antineoplastic agent; copper complex; morpholine; thiosemicarbazone; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; coordination compound; copper; morpholine derivative; orphan nuclear receptor; thiosemicarbazone derivative; antibacterial activity; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; bacterial viability; cell viability assay; drug mechanism; drug solubility; drug stability; drug synthesis; female; human; human cell; lipophilicity; malignant neoplasm; molecular docking; nonhuman; ovarian carcinoma cell line; ovary carcinoma; potentiometric titration; solid state; Staphylococcus aureus; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Western blotting; animal; binding site; cell proliferation; chemistry; conformation; drug effect; enzyme active site; metabolism; mouse; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; solubility; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell line; X ray crystallography; Animals; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Binding Sites; Catalytic Domain; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Coordination Complexes; Copper; Crystallography, X-Ray; Humans; Mice; Molecular Conformation; Molecular Docking Simulation; Morpholines; Orphan Nuclear Receptors; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Solubility; Structure-Activity Relationship; Thiosemicarbazones"
"Hearing, speech reception, vocabulary and language: Population epidemiology and concordance in Australian children aged 11 to 12 years and their parents",2019,"Objectives To describe the epidemiology and parent-child concordance of hearing, speech reception, vocabulary and language in Australian parent-child dyads at child age 11 to 12 years. Design Population-based cross-sectional study (Child Health CheckPoint) nested within the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Setting Assessment centres in seven Australian cities and eight regional towns or home visits around Australia, February 2015 to March 2016. Participants Of all participating CheckPoint families (n=1874), 1516 children (50% female) and 1520 parents (87% mothers, mean age 43.8 years) undertook at least one of four measurements of hearing and language. Outcome measures Hearing threshold (better ear mean of 1, 2 and 4 kHz) from pure-tone audiometry, speech reception threshold, receptive vocabulary, expressive and receptive languages using a sentence repetition task. Parent-child concordance was examined using Pearson's correlation coefficients and adjusted linear regression models. Survey weights and methods accounted for Longitudinal Study of Australian Children's complex sampling and stratification. Results Children had a similar speech reception threshold to parents (children mean-14.3, SD 2.4; parents-14.9, SD 3.2 dB) but better hearing acuity (children 8.3, SD 6.3; parents 13.4, SD 7.0 decibels hearing level). Standardised sentence repetition scores were similar (children 9.8, SD 2.9; parents 9.1, SD 3.3) but, as expected, parents had superior receptive vocabularies. Parent-child correlations were higher for the cognitively-based language measures (vocabulary 0.31, 95% CI 0.26 to 0.36; sentence repetition 0.29, 95% CI 0.24 to 0.34) than the auditory measures (hearing 0.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.23; speech reception threshold 0.18, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.22). Mother-child and father-child concordances were similar for all measures. Conclusions We provide population reference values for multiple measures spanning auditory and verbal communication systems in children and mid-life adults. Concordance values aligned with previous twin studies and offspring studies in adults, in keeping with polygenic heritability that is modest for audition but around 60% for language by late childhood. ? 2019 Author(s).","adult; article; auditory threshold; Australian; child; child parent relation; childhood; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; ear; father; female; hearing acuity; heritability; human; human experiment; human tissue; language; linear regression analysis; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mother; outcome assessment; progeny; pure tone audiometry; reference value; sampling; school child; speech; stratification; twin study; vocabulary; inheritance; pure tone audiometry; reference value; speech perception"
"All-Cause Mortality Following an Acute Coronary Syndrome: 12-Year Follow-Up of the Comprehensive 2002 New Zealand Acute Coronary Syndrome Audit",2019,"Background: To describe the long-term mortality of a complete national cohort of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients enrolled in 2002, to compare this with a national age, sex and M?ori ethnicity matched population, and to assess the influence of baseline factors on the 12-year mortality. Methods: We reviewed 721 patients with a discharge diagnosis of an ACS who were enrolled in the first New Zealand ACS audit group cohort over 14 days in May 2002. We matched the cohort to the national mortality database using each patient's unique national identity number. Results: Over a median follow-up of 12.7 years of 721 patients discharged with an ACS, overall mortality was 52%: ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) (58%), non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) (61%) and unstable angina pectoris (UAP) (42%) patients, p < 0.0001. In an age-adjusted survival model, males had a 29% increased mortality rate compared to females with a hazard ratio of 1.29 (95% CI 1.04, 1.61, p = 0.019). Over 12 years there were 339 (47%) deaths, compared to 284 (39%) deaths observed in the matched population. The standardised mortality ratio for patients admitted with an ACS in New Zealand is 1.3 (95% CI 1.2, 1.5) with eight patients per 100 not surviving to 12 years compared to this matched population. Conclusions: The high mortality rate in this ACS cohort is a stark reminder of the prognostic implications of a presentation with an ACS. It emphasises the on-going need for optimal management of these patients throughout every stage of their initial treatment and subsequent on-going care. ? 2017 Australian and New Zealand Society of Cardiac and Thoracic Surgeons (ANZSCTS) and the Cardiac Society of Australia and New Zealand (CSANZ)","acute coronary syndrome; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cause of death; clinical audit; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); New Zealand; non ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; priority journal; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; survival; unstable angina pectoris; very elderly; acute coronary syndrome; clinical trial; epidemiology; factual database; forecasting; hospital discharge; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; procedures; risk factor; survival rate; trends; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Clinical Audit; Databases, Factual; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Forecasting; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Patient Discharge; Risk Factors; Survival Rate"
"“It is OK to let them know you are human too”: Mentor self-disclosure in formal youth mentoring relationships",2019,"This study aims to capture descriptive data on how mentors self-disclose to their adolescent mentees. Self-disclosure is a normative communication process that facilitates trust and closeness in interpersonal relationships. Despite being a relational intervention, little is known about self-disclosure in youth-mentoring relationships. A total of 54 mentors from 2 community-based mentoring programs in Auckland, New Zealand, participated in this mixed-methods study about their experiences of disclosing to mentees via an online questionnaire. In this sample, mentors disclosed about various topics, including hobbies, school and work, health, beliefs, self-esteem, substance use, emotions, sex, and money. Qualitative analysis identified themes regarding how mentors self-disclose, disclosure influencing positive relationship characteristics, the influence of mentoring programs, challenges with mentee interest and culture clashes, and the perceived effect of self-disclosure on mentees and the mentoring relationship. These mentors disclosed broadly and viewed generally self-disclosure in a positive way, but they also experienced challenges and complexities. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adolescent; article; female; health belief; human; human experiment; intimacy; juvenile; male; mentor; mentoring; money; New Zealand; qualitative analysis; questionnaire; self disclosure; self esteem; substance use; thematic analysis; trust"
"Maternal stress during pregnancy and small for gestational age birthweight are not associated with telomere length at 11?years of age",2019,"Background: Previous studies indicate that low birth weight and exposure to maternal stress during pregnancy may result in shortened telomeres in infants. Shorter telomere length has in turn been linked with accelerated ageing and with age-related diseases. This study aimed to investigate the association between pregnancy and birth factors and relative telomere length in offspring at 11 years of age. Methods: Participants were aged 11 years enrolled in the Auckland Birthweight Collaborative Study at birth (n = 380). Half of the children were born small for gestational age (SGA = birthweight ? 10th percentile) and half were appropriate for gestational age (AGA = birthweight > 10th percentile). Maternal stress during pregnancy was assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale. Relative leukocyte telomere length (RTL) in leukocytes was measured at 11 years of age using quantitative real-time PCR. Results: RTL was normally distributed (mean = 3.78, SD = 1.05). There were no significant associations between RTL at age 11 years and birthweight, sex, maternal smoking, maternal stress during pregnancy or maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index. Conclusion: At age 11 years, RTL did not differ between children by birthweight or pregnancy-related stressors. Further telomere-related studies in newborns, children and adolescents are merited to increase knowledge of potential telomere modulating factors. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","DNA; Article; birth weight; blood analysis; body mass; child; Europe; female; gestational age; human; human cell; leukocyte; major clinical study; male; maternal smoking; maternal stress; patient risk; Perceived Stress Scale; pregnancy; priority journal; progeny; real time polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; school child; telomere length; adult; birth weight; genetics; gestational age; maternal inheritance; mental stress; metabolism; newborn; physiology; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; small for date infant; telomere; telomere homeostasis; telomere shortening; Adult; Birth Weight; Body Mass Index; Child; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Leukocytes; Male; Maternal Inheritance; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Stress, Psychological; Telomere; Telomere Homeostasis; Telomere Shortening"
"Longitudinal patterns of behavior, cognition, and quality of life after mild traumatic brain injury in children: BIONIC study findings",2019,"Background: Research following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) during childhood predominantly examines recovery up to 12 months post-injury. Objectives: To determine children’s longer-term (4 years) patterns and predictors of recovery. Methods: Parents of 196 children (aged 1–15 years) completed the Behaviour Assessment System for Children and Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory at baseline, 1, 6, 12, and 48 months post-injury. Children aged ?8 years at each assessment completed a computerized neurocognitive testing battery. At 1 month, parents completed the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Multilevel modeling accounted for repeated measures. Results: Children had significantly fewer child behavior problems, better adaptability, and improved quality of life after 12 months. Concurrent improvements in overall neurocognitive function were no longer significant once adjusted for age, gender, and socio-economic status. From 12 to 48 months, quality of life reduced significantly while child behavior and neurocognition plateaued. Child behavior problems and worse quality of life were associated with parental anxiety and lower socio-economic status. Conclusions: Children’s recovery in the year following mTBI appears to plateau from 12 to 48 months, with a concomitant reduction in quality of life. Identification and treatment of parent mental health issues may reduce the exacerbation of negative child outcomes following mTBI. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","academic achievement; adaptation; adolescent; anxiety disorder; Article; behavior assessment; child; child behavior; cognition; cognitive function test; convalescence; environmental factor; female; health; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; infant; long term survival; major clinical study; male; newborn; parent; Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; pediatric traumatic brain injury; preschool child; problem behavior; quality of life; school child; social psychology; social status; socioeconomics"
"Critical health education studies: Reflections on a new conference and this themed symposium",2019,"In May 2018, a group of scholars gathered in the icy and sunlit grandeur of Queenstown (Aotearoa New Zealand) to talk, debate and share ideas about health education. The conference aimed to trouble and disrupt traditional kinds of health education and, instead, suggest possibilities for the critical study of health education – both in terms of theory and practice. This introduction to the special themed symposium is a reflection by the six authors on that new conference – Critical Studies in Health Education (CHESS) – and what it aimed to achieve. The authors discuss and define the intent of critical approaches to health education, and reflect on their experiences of the conference, as well as the future of the field.

"Penetrance and expressivity of the R858H CACNA1C variant in a five-generation pedigree segregating an arrhythmogenic channelopathy",2019,"Background: Isolated cardiac arrhythmia due to a variant in CACNA1C is of recent knowledge. Most reports have been of singleton cases or of quite small families, and estimates of penetrance and expressivity have been difficult to obtain. We here describe a large pedigree, from which such estimates have been calculated. Methods: We studied a five-generation family, in which a CACNA1C variant c.2573G>A p.Arg858His co-segregates with syncope and cardiac arrest, documenting electrocardiographic data and cardiac symptomatology. The reported patients/families from the literature with CACNA1C gene variants were reviewed, and genotype–phenotype correlations are drawn. Results: The range of phenotype in the studied family is wide, from no apparent effect, through an asymptomatic QT interval prolongation on electrocardiography, to episodes of presyncope and syncope, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden death. QT prolongation showed inconsistent correlation with functional cardiology. Based upon analysis of 28 heterozygous family members, estimates of penetrance and expressivity are derived. Conclusions: These estimates of penetrance and expressivity, for this specific variant, may be useful in clinical practice. Review of the literature indicates that individual CACNA1C variants have their own particular genotype–phenotype correlations. We suggest that, at least in respect of the particular variant reported here, “arrhythmogenic channelopathy” may be a more fitting nomenclature than long QT syndrome. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Sex-specific longitudinal associations of screen viewing time in children at 2–3 years with adiposity at 3–5 years",2019,"Objectives: Screen-viewing in late childhood has been associated with adiposity and blood pressure (BP), but evidence is lacking at younger ages. To investigate the prospective associations of total and device-specific screen-viewing at age 2–3 years with BMI, sum of skinfold thicknesses and BP among Singaporean children at age 3–5 years. Methods: As part of the Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO) cohort, mothers/caregivers reported the time per day their 2 and 3-year-old children watched/used television, handheld devices and computers. Average screen-viewing time (total, television and handheld-devices) at ages 2 and 3 years was used in the analyses. Height; weight; triceps, biceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses; and systolic and diastolic BP were measured at ages 3, 4 and 5. Associations of screen-viewing with BMI, sum of skinfold thicknesses and BP in 956 children were investigated using repeated-measures linear regression models. Analyses were further stratified by sex as we found significant interaction. Results: Among boys and girls combined, screen-viewing was positively associated with sum of skinfold thicknesses, but not with BMI or BP. Sex-specific analyses showed significant associations with both BMI and sum of skinfold thicknesses in boys, but not in girls. Screen-viewing was not associated with BP in boys or girls. The increases in mean (95% CI) BMI per hour increase in daily total, television and handheld-devices screen-viewing among boys were 0.12 (0.03, 0.21), 0.18 (0.06, 0.30) and 0.11 (?0.07, 0.29) kg/m2, respectively. The corresponding increases in mean sum of skinfold thicknesses were 0.68 (0.29, 1.07), 0.79 (0.26, 1.32) and 1.18 (0.38, 1.99) mm. Conclusions: Greater screen-viewing at age 2–3 years was associated with later adiposity at 3–5 years in boys, but not in girls. In light of the increasing use of screen devices and cardiometabolic risk in young children, these findings may have important public health implications. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","Article; blood pressure measurement; body height; body mass; body weight; child; childhood obesity; female; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; preschool child; priority journal; screen time; sex difference; Singapore; skinfold thickness; television viewing"
"Skeletal phenotype of the neuropeptide Y knockout mouse",2019,"Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is involved in multiple processes such as behavior, energy and bone metabolism. Previous studies have relied on global NPY depletion to examine its effects on bone. However, this approach is unable to distinguish the central or local source of NPY influencing bone. Our aim was to identify which cells within the skeleton express Npy and establish a model that will enable us to differentiate effects of NPY derived from different cell types. We have generated the NPY floxed (NPY flox ) mice using CRISPR technology. By crossing the NPY flox mice with Hypoxanthine Phosphoribosyltransferase 1 (Hprt)-cre to generate a global knockout, we were able to validate and confirm loss of Npy transcript and protein in our global NPYKO. Global deletion of NPY results in a smaller femoral cortical cross-sectional area (?12%) and reduced bone strength (?18%) in male mice. In vitro, NPY-deficient bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) showed increase in osteogenic differentiation detected by increases in alkaline phosphatase staining and bone sialoprotein and osteocalcin expression. Despite both sexes presenting with increased adiposity, female mice had no alterations in bone mass, suggesting that NPY may have sex-specific effects on bone. In this study we identified Npy expression in the skeleton and examined the effect of global NPY depletion to bone mass. The differential impact of NPY deletion in cortical and cancellous compartments along with differences in phenotypes between in vitro and in vivo, highlights the complex nature of NPY signaling, indicative of distinct sources that can be dissected in the future using this NPY flox model. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","alkaline phosphatase; neuropeptide Y; osteocalcin; sialoprotein; neuropeptide Y; neuropeptide Y receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bone marrow stroma cell; bone mass; bone strength; brain tissue; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; controlled study; cortical bone; female; femur; gene; gene deletion; gene expression; gene knockout; Hprt gene; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mouse; nerve cell differentiation; nonhuman; Npy gene; obesity; phenotype; priority journal; protein depletion; protein expression; signal transduction; skeleton; staining; validation study; animal; bone; bone density; bone development; genetics; knockout mouse; metabolism; physiology; Alkaline Phosphatase; Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Female; Male; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neuropeptide Y; Osteogenesis; Receptors, Neuropeptide Y"
"Variation in the barriers to compassion across healthcare training and disciplines: A cross-sectional study of doctors, nurses, and medical students",2019,"Background: Despite the established importance of compassion in health, studies examining the specific barriers to compassionate care in healthcare are few. Recent work suggests that examining differences as a function of professional development and identifying variation in barriers to compassionate care across professions may highlight the origins of barriers and inform the development of compassion-enhancing interventions suited to the unique challenges of different professions and stages of training. Objectives: To explore whether the barriers to compassion vary (a) between physicians and nurses and (b) across samples of physicians and medical students (i.e., as a function of development and clinical experience). It was expected that medical students would report greater barriers than physicians and that nurses would generally report lower barriers to compassion, other than for external barriers. Methods: Registered nurses, physicians, and medical students were recruited using convenience sampling in New Zealand. Following consent, 1700 participants (801 nurses, 516 physicians, and 383 medical students) completed a survey including the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory and the Barriers to Physician Compassion questionnaire. Results: As expected, medical students reported greater barriers to compassion than physicians and nurses, with both professions generally reporting lower barriers. However, and also consistent with hypotheses, nurses reported greater work-environment-related barriers relative to physicians. Discussion: Students reported greater barriers than physicians. While nurses generally reported lower barriers than physicians, they specifically reported greater work environment-related barriers. For nurses, results highlight the importance of implementing interventions that reduce external barriers to compassion, specifically the need to alleviate the structural barriers and restrictions that nurses face. For medical students and younger healthcare professionals, the results highlight the importance of mentorship, support, and ongoing professional and emotional development. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","adult; article; burnout; convenience sample; cross-sectional study; doctor nurse relation; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical student; mentor; New Zealand; occupation; questionnaire; registered nurse; work environment; cross-sectional study; education; empathy; health personnel attitude; medical student; medicine; nurse; nursing discipline; physician; psychology; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Empathy; Humans; Medicine; Nurses; Physicians; Specialties, Nursing; Students, Medical"
"Hydroxyquinoline-derived anticancer organometallics: Introduction of amphiphilic PTA as an ancillary ligand increases their aqueous solubility",2019,"Organometallic compounds based on bioactive ligand systems have shown promising antiproliferative properties. The use of 8-hydroxyquinoline and its derivatives as bioactive ligands resulted in organometallic complexes with potent anticancer activity, but they lack aqueous solubility for further development. We report here the preparation of a series of MII/III(cym/Cp*)Cl complexes (η6-p-cymene (cym): M = Ru, Os; η5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*): M = Rh, Ir) with hydroxyquinoline-derived co-ligands and in a subsequent step the substitution of the chlorido ligands for amphiphilic 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphatricyclo-[3.3.1.1]decane (PTA). Solubility studies indicated that the introduced PTA ligand significantly improved the aqueous solubility of all complexes. The complexes were shown to be stable in aqueous and DMSO solution over a period of at least 3 d. As would be expected for such modification of complexes, the higher solubility resulted in significantly decreased cytotoxicity in cancer cells. The antiproliferative activity was still more pronounced than that of RAPTA-C [Ru(cym)(PTA)Cl] which, however, has been demonstrated to have antimetastatic and antiangiogenic properties in vivo. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","1,3,5 triaza 7 phosphatricyclo [3.3.1.1]decane; 8 quinolinol; amphophile; decane; organometallic compound; quinolinol derivative; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; aqueous solution; Article; cancer cell; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; complex formation; cytotoxicity; electrospray; in vivo study; mass spectrometry; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; room temperature; solubility; X ray diffraction"
"Social capital and health risk: An integrative review",2019,"The impact of health risk behaviours on the social and economic fabric of society is of concern to social marketers and policy makers. Current research suggests social capital, that is, the positive benefits gained from a relationship with others in the community, plays a key role in addressing health risk behaviours. The current literature on social capital and health is fragmented, and the field has yet to produce an up-to-date synthesis of past findings to help researchers understand the current status of this research area. This article fills this gap with an integrative review of empirical research based on rigorous criteria. Boolean search was used to limit the search to only those articles containing the keywords ‘social capital’ and ‘health risk’ but no limits were applied for country or population of interest or publication start date. Two researchers screened through the title, abstract and introduction of every retrieved article independently according to the inclusion criteria. A total of 105 articles were eligible for further analyses. This article contributes by: (1) providing a structured overview with an aim to disentangle the findings of varied past studies addressing the theme; (2) identifying important gaps in current knowledge; (3) presenting a research agenda that flows logically from the theoretical gaps identified; and lastly (4) proposing a theoretical framework upon which social capital interventions can be designed and executed to mitigate health risk. We hope that the key issues and new directions presented in this paper will provide new impetus in this area of research. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",""
"Orthogonal assays for the identification of inhibitors of the single-stranded nucleic acid binding protein YB-1",2019,"We have previously shown that high expression of the nucleic acid binding factor YB-1 is strongly associated with poor prognosis in a variety of cancer types. The 3-dimensional protein structure of YB-1 has yet to be determined and its role in transcriptional regulation remains elusive. Drug targeting of transcription factors is often thought to be difficult and there are very few published high-throughput screening approaches. YB-1 predominantly binds to single-stranded nucleic acids, adding further difficulty to drug discovery. Therefore, we have developed two novel screening assays to detect compounds that interfere with the transcriptional activation properties of YB-1, both of which may be generalizable to screen for inhibitors of other nucleic acid binding molecules. The first approach is a cell-based luciferase reporter gene assay that measures the level of activation of a fragment of the E2F1 promoter by YB-1. The second approach is a novel application of the AlphaScreen system, to detect interference of YB-1 interaction with a single-stranded DNA binding site. These complementary assays examine YB-1 binding to two discrete nucleic acid sequences using two different luminescent signal outputs and were employed sequentially to screen 7360 small molecule compounds leading to the identification of three putative YB-1 inhibitors. ? 2019 Chinese Pharmaceutical Association and Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences","jk 0395b 007; protein inhibitor; rus 0016b 003; rus 0020d 011; rus 0028g 002; rus 0116g 009; rus 0116h 006; rus 0202g 005; rus 0207a 006; rus0rus 0202g 005; transcription factor E2F1; unclassified drug; Y box binding protein 1; A-375 cell line; Article; cell adhesion; cell counting; competitive inhibition; controlled study; DNA content; electrophilicity; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; luciferase assay; luminescence; MDA-MB-231 cell line; nucleotide sequence; orthogonal assay; pH; promoter region; protein determination; protein DNA interaction; real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; reporter gene; transcription initiation"
"MCR-1: a promising target for structure-based design of inhibitors to tackle polymyxin resistance",2019,"The spread of a novel mobile colistin resistance gene (mcr1) has jeopardised the use of polymyxins, last-resort antibiotics that are used increasingly to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative pathogens. In early 2017, the WHO reported the global spread of mcr1 within a few years after its initial discovery in China. The protein encoded by mcr1 is a putative 60-kDa phosphoethanolamine (pEtN) transferase, MCR-1, and has been studied extensively since its discovery. Herein, we present a comprehensive review of MCR-1 covering its structure, function, and mechanism, to call for the rational drug design of molecular inhibitors of MCR-1 to use in colistin-based combination therapies. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","bacterial protein; ethanolamine; lipid A; mobile colistin resistance 1 protein; nucleophile; pentaerythrityl tetranitrate; phosphatidylethanolamine binding protein; polymyxin; unclassified drug; zinc binding protein; drug design; enzyme active site; gene; human; mobile colistin resistance gene 1; nonhuman; polymyxin resistance; protein phosphorylation; Review; World Health Organization"
"Computer-Aided Diagnostic System for Early Detection of Acute Renal Transplant Rejection Using Diffusion-Weighted MRI",2019,"Objective: Early diagnosis of acute renal transplant rejection (ARTR) is critical for accurate treatment. Although the current gold standard, diagnostic technique is renal biopsy, it is not preferred due to its invasiveness, long recovery time (1-2 weeks), and potential for complications, e.g., bleeding and/or infection. Methods: This paper presents a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) system for early ARTR detection using (3D + b-value) diffusion-weighted (DW) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. The CAD process starts from kidney tissue segmentation with an evolving geometric (level-set-based) deformable model. The evolution is guided by a voxel-wise stochastic speed function, which follows from a joint kidney-background Markov-Gibbs random field model accounting for an adaptive kidney shape prior and on-going kidney-background visual appearances. A B-spline-based three-dimensional data alignment is employed to handle local deviations due to breathing and heart beating. Then, empirical cumulative distribution functions of apparent diffusion coefficients of the segmented DW-MRI at different b-values are collected as discriminatory transplant status features. Finally, a deep-learning-based classifier with stacked nonnegative constrained autoencoders is employed to distinguish between rejected and nonrejected renal transplants. Results: In our initial 'leave-one-subject-out' experiment on 100 subjects, 97.0% of the subjects were correctly classified. The subsequent four-fold and ten-fold cross-validations gave the average accuracy of 96.0% and 94.0%, respectively. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the promise of this new CAD system to reliably diagnose renal transplant rejection. Significance: The technology presented here can significantly impact the quality of care of renal transplant patients since it has the potential to replace the gold standard in kidney diagnosis, biopsy. ? 1964-2012 IEEE.","Biopsy; Deep learning; Deformation; Distribution functions; Image segmentation; Magnetic resonance imaging; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Surface diffusion; CAD system; Deformable models; Kidney; Renal rejection; Shape; Three dimensional displays; acute graft rejection; adolescent; adult; Article; child; classifier; computer aided design; control group; controlled study; deep learning; diffusion weighted imaging; early diagnosis; female; health care quality; human; human tissue; kidney biopsy; kidney graft rejection; kidney tissue; kidney transplantation; major clinical study; male; signal noise ratio; algorithm; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; early diagnosis; graft rejection; kidney; kidney transplantation; middle aged; procedures; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Child; Deep Learning; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Early Diagnosis; Female; Graft Rejection; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Kidney; Kidney Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult"
"Is anyone listening? Inequality in New Zealand’s fully funded hearing aid scheme",2019,"This paper explores the New Zealand Ministry of Health’s (MOH) allocation of funding for the Hearing Aid Funding Scheme?(HAFS) and the level of service delivery by public and private sectors. The crux of the paper centres on how the system is funded and in what ways the market structure may be affecting access to health care. The study involved three main sampling strategies with primary data being collected from the District Health Board (DHB) clinics and private providers. This was supported with secondary data of service utilization and claims, which was made available via the MOH. DHB and private provider data was collected online. This study found that the market structure and nature of the NZ hearing industry is consistent with an oligopoly–something, which has been assumed in the past but never formally acknowledged. Publicly funded DHB clinics are restricting access to adult hearing aid referrals, as well as referring rejected patients to private audiology providers for ongoing treatment. The findings were consistent with implementation of co-payment fees through DHB and private audiology providers. These findings indicate that high co-payment fees may be increasing the chance of negative externalities, due to a reduction in access and affordability. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"The barriers and facilitators for nurse educators using telehealth for education",2019,"Telehealth is available world-wide and in addition to clinical uses, it can also be used to provide education for health professionals, supporting e-Networking. However, within New Zealand the uptake and widespread use of telehealth remains low, and why telehealth is not used more is not understood. This study describes nurse educators use of telehealth for education and identifies barriers and facilitators to increase the uptake of telehealth amongst nurse educators. An on-line survey administered using Survey Monkey had a response rate of 57% (n=19). Equipment that was not user friendly and a lack of initial training were recognised as barriers to their uptake of telehealth. Telehealth training and support, and local champions were identified facilitators to increase the uptake of telehealth. Recommendations include the need for early adopting nurse educators to be recognised and encouraged, to role model good practice in telehealth, and mentor and support others. ? 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.

"Birth choices for women in a ‘Positive Birth after Caesarean' clinic: Randomised trial of alternative shared decision support strategies",2019,"Background: Systematic approaches to information giving and decision support for women with previous caesarean sections are needed. Aim: To evaluate decision support within a ‘real-world' shared decision-making model. Methods: A pragmatic comparative effectiveness randomised trial in the Positive Birth After Caesarean Clinic. Women with one previous caesarean and singleton pregnancy <25?weeks were randomly allocated to standard Positive Birth After Caesarean care, or standard Positive Birth After Caesarean care plus a decision aid booklet. Main outcome measure was mode of birth, with secondary measures of knowledge, decisional conflict, birth choice, adherence to birth choice, perception of decision support, and satisfaction. Results: Of 297 participants, rate of attempted vaginal birth after caesarean increased and was similar for both groups (61% vs 57%, P?=?0.5). Knowledge scores increased more for women in the additional decision aid group (2.0 vs 1.6 points, P?=?0.2). Decisional conflict score reduction was similar between groups (P?=?0.5). Women initially unsure of their birth preference who received the additional decision aid had greater reduction in decisional conflict score (P?=?0.04) and were more likely to plan vaginal birth after caesarean (49% vs 33%, P?=?0.2). Adherence to birth choice and birth satisfaction was similar between groups. Women in the additional decision aid group rated their decision support tool higher (P?<?0.01). Conclusions: In a ‘real world' shared decision-making model, an additional decision aid conferred some benefits in factors associated with preparation for shared decision-making. Decision aids may provide particular benefit for women who are initially unsure and need assistance in the deliberation phase. ? 2019 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists","adult; article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; decision support system; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; outcome assessment; perception; pregnancy; randomized controlled trial; satisfaction; shared decision making; trial of labor; vaginal birth after cesarean"
"Neoadjuvant therapy and major arterial resection for potentially reconstructable arterial involvement by stage 3 adenocarcinoma of the pancreas",2019,"Background: Stage 3 pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is defined by arterial involvement. This study objective was to evaluate outcomes for patients with stage 3 PDAC with potentially reconstructable arterial involvement, considered for neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) and pancreatic resection, and to compare outcomes following arterial (AR) and non-arterial resection (NAR). Methods: This study included patients from 2009 to 2016 with biopsy-proven stage 3 PDAC who were offered NAT before surgical exploration. AR was performed if required to achieve R0 resection. Time to event outcomes were analysed from diagnosis date. Results: 87/89 patients (97.8%) received NAT (chemotherapy 41.6%, chemotherapy/radiotherapy 56.2%). 46/89 (51.7%) underwent exploration; 31 underwent resection (AR n = 20, NAR n = 11). AR patients had longer operative time (681 vs. 563 min, p = 0.006) and more blood loss (1600 vs. 575 mL, p = 0.0004), with no difference for blood transfusion, pancreatic fistula, length of stay, reoperation, or mortality. R0 rate was 30/31. Post-resection 90-day mortality was 3.2%. Median overall survival was statistically comparable between the AR and NAR groups (19.7 vs. 28.4 months, p = 0.41). Conclusions: AR had comparable clinical and oncologic outcomes to NAR. Following careful selection and non-progression after NAT, major AR may cautiously be considered if required to obtain a negative resection margin. ? 2018","capecitabine; cisplatin; fluorouracil; gemcitabine; irinotecan; oxaliplatin; paclitaxel; adult; aged; artery surgery; Article; blood transfusion; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer staging; chemoradiotherapy; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; operation duration; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; overall survival; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreas fistula; reoperation; retrospective study"
"Development and validation of an HPLC-DAD-MS method for determination of four nucleoside compounds in the New Zealand native mushroom Hericium sp.",2019,"To identify and quantify the content of nucleoside compounds in the New Zealand native edible mushroom Hericium sp., a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a triple quadrupole detector mass method was developed and validated. Four nucleoside substitutes, namely cytidine, uridine, adenosine, and guanosine, were identified. Optimization was conducted to study the effect of extraction method type, solvent pH, and extraction time. The optimal conditions were obtained using ultrasonic treatment in water at pH 3.8 for 30 min. For chromatographic separation, a C18 column was applied using 0.1% formic acid (pH 3.4) as the mobile phase with detection at 260 nm. The total concentration of the four nucleoside compounds was high, at 10.7 mg/g dry weight, indicating a potential benefit for human health. The excellent validation results based on selectivity, linearity, precision, accuracy and robustness revealed the reliability of the newly developed analytical method, which could be applied routinely in research laboratories. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","High performance liquid chromatography; Research laboratories; Solvent extraction; Ultrasonic applications; Water treatment; Adenosine; Cytidine; Guanosines; Hericium sp; HPLC; Nucleoside; Pubchem; Uridine; Biomolecules; adenosine; cytidine; guanosine; nucleoside derivative; uridine; nucleoside; solvent; accuracy; analytic method; Article; chemical structure; drug design; drug determination; drug identification; edible mushroom; electrospray; extraction time; Hericium erinaceus; high performance liquid chromatography; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; New Zealand; pH; triple quadrupole mass spectrometry; Agaricales; chemistry; high performance liquid chromatography; isolation and purification; mass spectrometry; metabolism; procedures; reproducibility; Agaricales; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Limit of Detection; Mass Spectrometry; New Zealand; Nucleosides; Reproducibility of Results; Solvents"
"Germline CDH1 mutations are a significant contributor to the high frequency of early-onset diffuse gastric cancer cases in New Zealand M?ori",2019,"New Zealand M?ori have a considerably higher incidence of gastric cancer compared to non-M?ori, and are one of the few populations worldwide with a higher prevalence of diffuse-type disease. Pathogenic germline CDH1 mutations are causative of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, a cancer predisposition syndrome primarily characterised by an extreme lifetime risk of developing diffuse gastric cancer. Pathogenic CDH1 mutations are well described in M?ori families in New Zealand. However, the contribution of these mutations to the high incidence of gastric cancer is unknown. We have used next-generation sequencing, Sanger sequencing, and Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe Amplification to examine germline CDH1 in an unselected series of 94 M?ori gastric cancer patients and 200 healthy matched controls. Overall, 18% of all cases, 34% of cases diagnosed with diffuse-type gastric cancer, and 67% of cases diagnosed aged less than 45?years carried pathogenic CDH1 mutations. After adjusting for the effect of screening known HDGC families, we estimate that 6% of all advanced gastric cancers and 13% of all advanced diffuse-type gastric cancers would carry germline CDH1 mutations. Our results demonstrate that germline CDH1 mutations are a significant contributor to the high frequency of diffuse gastric cancer in New Zealand M?ori. ? 2018, The Author(s).","fizzy related protein; uvomorulin; cadherin; CDH1 protein, human; leukocyte antigen; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer risk; cancer screening; case control study; controlled study; diffuse type stomach cancer; early cancer diagnosis; female; frameshift mutation; gastrectomy; genetic susceptibility; germline mutation; human; indel mutation; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); middle aged; multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification; New Zealand; next generation sequencing; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Sanger sequencing; single nucleotide polymorphism; stomach cancer; dna mutational analysis; epidemiology; ethnology; genetic predisposition; genetic screening; genetics; germline mutation; high throughput sequencing; incidence; onset age; pathology; procedures; statistics and numerical data; stomach tumor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age of Onset; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antigens, CD; Cadherins; DNA Mutational Analysis; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Testing; Germ-Line Mutation; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Stomach Neoplasms; Young Adult"
"An initial investigation of neonatal neuroanatomy, caregiving, and levels of disorganized behavior",2019,"Attachment disorganization is a risk factor for difficulties in attention, social relationships, and mental health. Conceptually, attachment disorganization may indicate a breakdown in fear regulation resulting from repeated exposure to frightening maternal care. In addition, past research has examined the influence of stress-inducing contextual factors and/or child factors upon the development of disorganization. However, no past work has assessed whether infant neuroanatomy, important to stress regulation, moderates the association between maternal care and levels of disorganized behavior. Here, utilizing data from a subsample of 82 dyads taking part in the “Growing Up in Singapore towards Healthy Outcomes” (GUSTO) cohort, we assessed the prediction from maternal sensitive caregiving at 6 mo and levels of attachment disorganization at 1.5 y, as moderated by hippocampal and amygdala volume determined within the first 2 weeks of life. Results indicate a significant interaction between neonatal left hippocampal volume and maternal sensitivity upon levels of disorganized behavior. Although these results require substantiation in further research, if replicated, they may enable new strategies for the identification of processes important to child mental health and points for intervention. This is because neonatal neuroanatomy, as opposed to genetic variation and sociodemographic risk, may be more directly linked to stress responses within individuals. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"Mobilising Mothers: The 1917 National Baby Week",2019,"This article focuses on Britain's 1917 National Baby Week and specifically how it played out in London. Pageantry and celebration were an important part of the event, and possibly a welcome distraction from the trials and horrors of war, and they were embraced by women of all social classes. But there was much more to it, as women who led the event seized the opportunity for political purposes, in what appeared to be an unthreatening environment of celebrating motherhood. Their goal was to promote the material wellbeing of, and state support for, women and children, and in this they were remarkably successful. Baby Week was also seized upon as an opportunity to showcase other welfare systems as a model for Britain, focusing in particular on New Zealand, with its free and comprehensive health service for infants. Rather than reflecting the eugenic and pronatalist concerns of the establishment, the event should be seen as a moment of politicisation of women arguing for cross-class social reform targeted at mothers. ?

"Evaluating the potential of younger cases and older controls cohorts to improve discovery power in genome-wide association studies of late-onset diseases",2019,"For more than a decade, genome-wide association studies have been making steady progress in discovering the causal gene variants that contribute to late-onset human diseases. Polygenic late-onset diseases in an aging population display a risk allele frequency decrease at older ages, caused by individuals with higher polygenic risk scores becoming ill proportionately earlier and bringing about a change in the distribution of risk alleles between new cases and the as-yet-unaffected population. This phenomenon is most prominent for diseases characterized by high cumulative incidence and high heritability, examples of which include Alzheimer’s disease, coronary artery disease, cerebral stroke, and type 2 diabetes, while for late-onset diseases with relatively lower prevalence and heritability, exemplified by cancers, the effect is significantly lower. In this research, computer simulations have demonstrated that genome-wide association studies of late-onset polygenic diseases showing high cumulative incidence together with high initial heritability will benefit from using the youngest possible age-matched cohorts. Moreover, rather than using age-matched cohorts, study cohorts combining the youngest possible cases with the oldest possible controls may significantly improve the discovery power of genome-wide association studies. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Different domains of deprivation and their relationship with obesity in New Zealand 4-year-old children",2019,"Background: There is a relationship between childhood obesity and area-level deprivation. While the New Zealand Index of Deprivation (NZDep) has been used widely in research for the past 20?years, the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) was released in 2017. This study aims to investigate the association between deprivation and childhood obesity in New Zealand and compare measures of deprivation. Methods: Data from 316?794 4-year-olds in New Zealand undertaking the B4 School Check in 2010 to 2016, a national health and development screen, were analysed. Multilevel logistic regression models assessed the relationship between area-level deprivation and individual-level child obesity. Models were adjusted for age, sex, immigration status, ethnicity, and year. Deprivation was measured using the census-based NZDep2013 (deciles) and the administrative data-based IMD (deciles). The seven domains of the IMD were also considered. Results: The relationship between deprivation and obesity was very similar for the IMD and NZDep2013, point estimates were near identical, and confidence intervals overlapped substantially. Higher levels of deprivation were associated with a higher prevalence of child obesity. The relationship between deprivation and child obesity varied considerably across IMD domains. The education domain had the strongest association with child obesity and had an association with child obesity independent of the other domains of deprivation. Conclusion: Overall, there was little difference between the NZDep and IMD. However, the IMD's domains and IMD-1 approach reveal more nuanced understandings of the deprivation-obesity gradient, including the importance of area-level education deprivation for predicting child obesity rates. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation","Article; child; childhood adversity; childhood obesity; crime; education; employment; female; health care access; health status; household income; housing; human; male; New Zealand; personal income; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; childhood obesity; cross-sectional study; educational status; environment; ethnic group; socioeconomics; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Educational Status; Environment; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Male; New Zealand; Pediatric Obesity; Socioeconomic Factors"
"‘There's just no flexibility’: How space and time impact mental health consumer research",2019,"Non-consumer researchers collaborating with consumer researchers can benefit from greater relevance of research and improved congruence between research processes and health policy. As with all research collaborations, such partnerships are both constrained and facilitated by research ecosystems. However, it seems that collaborations with consumer researchers are impacted in particular ways by the research ecosystem. Drawing on ecological systems theory, this study aims to improve understandings of how ecological structures impact collaborations between non-consumer and consumer researchers. Interviews were conducted with 11 non-consumer researchers from a range of mental health disciplines about their experiences collaborating with consumer researchers. One theme developed through analysis of the data set related to the research ecosystem. Data from this theme were extracted and discursively analysed using the principles of discursive psychology. Findings emphasize distinct factors that influence collaborations at each level of the ecosystem, encompassing both local research culture and broader research systems. Findings suggest that external pressures (such as deadlines for funding applications, or bureaucratic processes) from the broader ecosystemic levels need to be challenged at the local collaboration level. Non-consumer researchers might support collaborations through, for instance, working to create enhanced flexibility in research timelines, or making time for relationship building, thus fostering more meaningful collaborations. ? 2019 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.","article; consumer; drawing; ecosystem; funding; human; human experiment; interview; mental health; psychology; scientist; theoretical study; community participation; health personnel attitude; health services research; mental health service; time factor; Attitude of Health Personnel; Community Participation; Health Services Research; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Mental Health Services; Time Factors"
"Utilization of CRISPR interference to validate MmpL3 as a drug target in mycobacterium tuberculosis",2019,"There is an urgent need for novel therapeutics to treat Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections. Genetic strategies for validating novel targets are available, yet their time-consuming nature limits their utility. Here, using MmpL3 as a model target, we report on the application of mycobacterial CRISPR interference for the rapid validation of target essentiality and compound mode of action. This strategy has the potential to rapidly accelerate tuberculosis drug discovery. Copyright ? 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

"Nutrition-related interventions targeting childhood overweight and obesity: A narrative review",2019,"Systematic reviews of nutritional interventions indicate limited efficacy in reducing childhood obesity, but their blanket conclusions could obscure promising components. This narrative review sought more detail on effective components within nutrition-related interventions involving children aged 2 to 11?years. In May 2016, the World Health Organization (WHO) searched the Cochrane Library and PubMed for relevant reviews. From 36 reviews, we screened 182 nutrition-related randomized trials for inclusion. We then reviewed those that reported at least 1 statistically significant (P?<?0.05) treatment benefit on body weight and/or composition outcomes at their longest follow-up assessment. Fourteen trials met inclusion criteria (median n?=?554; mean intervention duration?=?10.8?mo; follow-up?=?4.4?mo). “Effective” approaches included environmental changes such as school water fountain installations and cafeteria menu changes and possibly less sustainable strategies such as health education lessons. However, effect sizes even of these selected significant treatment benefits were modest—significant body mass index z-score effects range from ?0.1 to ?0.2. Each trial was associated with very small improvements in body composition. Because this is a “best-case” scenario (reflecting our design), trialists should rigorously test these strategies alone and possibly together; be open to novel strategies; and ensure that each strategy is culturally relevant and self-sustainable. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation.

"Relationship between BMI and adiposity among different ethnic groups in 2-year-old New Zealand children",2019,"Age-and sex-based BMI cut-offs are used to define overweight and obesity, but the relationship between BMI and body composition has not been very well studied in children or compared between children of different ethnic groups. Body size and composition in childhood are also influenced by size at birth. Our aim was to compare body size and composition at 2 years in children with different ethnicity and size at birth. We prospectively followed a multi-ethnic cohort of 300 children born with risk factors for neonatal hypoglycaemia (infants of diabetics, large or small at birth or late preterm) to 2 years corrected age. Complete data on weight, height and head circumference and body composition using bioelectrical impedance 24±1 months corrected age were available in 209 children. At birth, compared with European children, Chinese, Indian and other ethnicity children were lighter, and Indian children had smaller head circumferences, but birth lengths were similar in all ethnic groups. At 2 years, Pacific children were heavier and had higher BMI z scores, and Indian children had smaller head circumferences and lower BMI z scores than those from other ethnic groups. However, fat mass and fat-free mass indices were similar in all groups. At median BMI, fat mass:fat-free mass ratio was 23 % lower in Pacific than in Indian children (0·22 v. 0·27, P=0·03). BMI is not a good indicator of adiposity in this multi-ethnic cohort of 2-year-old New Zealand children. ? 2019 The Authors.","Article; birth weight; body composition; body height; body mass; body size; body weight; child; childhood obesity; Chinese; cohort analysis; ethnic difference; European; fat free mass; fat mass; head circumference; human; hypoglycemia; Indian; major clinical study; New Zealand; Pacific islands; preschool child; risk factor"
"Pancreas shrinkage following recurrent acute pancreatitis: an MRI study",2019,"Objective: Transition from the first attack of acute pancreatitis (AP) to chronic pancreatitis (CP) via recurrent AP is common. Total pancreas volume (TPV) and pancreas diameters are often reduced in advanced CP but have never been studied after AP. The objective of this study was to investigate pancreas size after clinical resolution of AP and its association with the number of AP attacks. Methods: Individuals with a history of AP were grouped based on the number of attacks (1, 2, ? 3 attacks). Healthy individuals were also recruited. All participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging, from which TPV and pancreas diameters (across the head, body, and tail) were measured independently by two raters in a blinded fashion. Generalised additive models (including age, sex, body mass index, and glycated haemoglobin levels) were used. Results: A total of 123 participants were studied. Total pancreas volume and tail diameter were significantly reduced in both unadjusted (TPV (p = 0.036), tail diameter (p = 0.009)) and adjusted (TPV (p = 0.026), tail diameter (p = 0.034)) models in individuals with ? 3 attacks, but not with 1 or 2 attacks, compared with healthy individuals. Head and body diameters did not differ significantly. Conclusions: Reduced TPV and tail diameter characterise individuals after ? 3 attacks of AP and may represent one of the earliest irreversible morphological changes in individuals after AP. A high-risk population for transition to CP might include individuals with at least 3 attacks of AP whereas those with less than 3 attacks might be at a low risk. Key Points: ? A significant reduction in total pancreas volume was demonstrated in individuals after 3 or more attacks of acute pancreatitis (without conventional signs of chronic pancreatitis). ? Pancreas tail diameter, but not head or body diameter, was reduced in individuals after 3 or more attacks of acute pancreatitis (without conventional signs of chronic pancreatitis). ? The above findings were independent of age, sex, body mass index, and glycated haemoglobin levels. ? 2019, European Society of Radiology.","glycosylated hemoglobin; acute pancreatitis; adult; aged; Article; cross-sectional study; female; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pancreas; priority journal; recurrent disease; acute disease; disease exacerbation; follow up; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pancreas; pancreatitis; pathology; procedures; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreas; Pancreatitis; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; ROC Curve"
"An Individual Participant Data Meta-analysis of Maternal Going-to-Sleep Position, Interactions with Fetal Vulnerability, and the Risk of Late Stillbirth",2019,"Background: Maternal supine going-to-sleep position has been associated with increased risk of late stillbirth (? 28 weeks), but it is unknown if the risk differs between right and left side, and if some pregnancies are more vulnerable. Methods: Systematic searches were undertaken for an individual-level participant data (IPD) meta-analysis of case–control studies, prospective cohort studies and randomised trials undertaken up until 26 Jan, 2018, that reported data on maternal going-to-sleep position and stillbirth. Participant inclusion criteria included gestation ? 28 weeks', non-anomalous, singleton pregnancies. The primary outcome was stillbirth. A one-stage approach stratified by study and site was used for the meta-analysis. The interaction between supine going-to-sleep position and fetal vulnerability was assessed by bi-variable regression. The multivariable model was adjusted for a priori confounders. Registration number: PROSPERO, CRD42017047703. Findings: Six case–control studies were identified, with data obtained from five (cases, n = 851; controls, n = 2257). No data was provided by a sixth study (cases, n = 100; controls, n = 200). Supine going-to-sleep position was associated with increased odds of late stillbirth (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.63, 95% CI 1.72–4.04, p < 0.0001) compared with left side. Right side had similar odds to left (aOR 1.04, 95% CI 0.83–1.31, p = 0.75). There were no significant interactions between supine going-to-sleep position and assessed indicators of fetal vulnerability, including small-for-gestational-age infants (p = 0.32), maternal obesity (p = 0.08), and smoking (p = 0.86). The population attributable risk for supine going-to-sleep position was 5.8% (3.2–9.2). Interpretation: This IPD meta-analysis confirms that supine going-to-sleep position is independently associated with late stillbirth. Going-to-sleep on left or right side appears equally safe. No significant interactions with our assessed indicators of fetal vulnerability were identified, therefore, supine going-to-sleep position can be considered a contributing factor for late stillbirth in all pregnancies. This finding could reduce late stillbirth by 5.8% if every pregnant woman ? 28 weeks' gestation settled to sleep on her side. ? 2019","Article; attributable risk; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; human; maternal obesity; meta analysis; outcome assessment; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; sleep pattern; small for date infant; smoking; stillbirth; supine position; systematic review; third trimester pregnancy"
"Trends in cardiovascular management of people with diabetes by primary healthcare nurses in Auckland, New Zealand",2019,"Aims: The study aim was to re-examine current work practices and evaluate time trends in the cardiovascular management of people with diabetes consulted by primary healthcare nurses in New Zealand. Methods: Primary healthcare nurses in the Auckland region were surveyed in 2006–2008 and 2016, with about one-third of practice, home care and specialist nurses randomly selected to participate. Nurses completed a self-administered questionnaire about demographic and workplace details, and a telephone interview about clinical care provided for people with diabetes during nursing consultations. Information was collected on a representative sample of people with diabetes consulted on one randomly selected work-day in the previous week. Results: Of all people with diabetes consulted by nurses, practice nurses consulted significantly more in 2016 (83%) compared with 60% in 2006–2008, whereas specialist nurse consultations decreased from 23% to 8% (P?=?0.01). In 2016, in people with diabetes, BMI was higher, and total cholesterol lower, yet the proportions of those receiving lifestyle advice (dietary and activity) remained unchanged from 2006–2008 levels. Smoking prevalence in people with diabetes was unchanged between the two surveys, although more people were asked if they wished to stop in 2016 compared with 2006–2008 (98% vs. 73%). In 2016, hours of nurses’ diabetes education were associated with increased routine assessments of risk factors in people with diabetes and checking laboratory results. Conclusions: Practice nurses are undertaking an increasing proportion of diabetes consultations. Although BMI in people with diabetes is increasing, the proportion of nurses offering lifestyle advice remains unchanged. Increasing diabetes education could strengthen the management of people with diabetes by community nurses. ? 2019 Diabetes UK","article; body mass; case report; cholesterol blood level; clinical article; clinical assessment; consultation; diabetes education; diabetic patient; diet; home care; human; lifestyle; New Zealand; nurse; prevalence; primary health care; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; smoking; telephone interview; workplace"
"Automated bed detection and removal from abdominal CT images for automatic segmentation applications",2019,"Image segmentation is an important component of automated image based diagnosis, since these application need information in form of the location of the anatomy of the patient. In order to realise a fully automated system, the exact location of the patient in the image should not affect an automated image processing algorithm. An initial step in automatic localisation of the patient is to identify where the bed is located in the image. For this work we focused on locating the bed in 3D from a volumetric abdominal CT dataset intended for liver cancer diagnosis. Our method is based on low level image processing namely multiple thresholding to automatically identify the field of view of the image, and identify the patient’s body separately from the bed, if the bed is within the field of view. The bed is then removed so as to not affect further image processing steps. The method was chosen to be fast and generic, so that it is applicable for a wide range of abdominal CT images, regardless of the CT scanner used, use of contrast, image resolution, field of view (FOV) and location of patient and bed. We tested our method on the publicly available Liver Tumor Segmentation (LiTS) Challenge dataset which comprises of anonymised abdominal CT volumes for over 100 patients. Our proposed method is able to correctly identify and remove the bed from all CT volumes we evaluated with. ? 2018 IEEE.","Automation; Biomedical engineering; Diagnosis; Image resolution; Image segmentation; Location; Automated image processing; Automatic segmentations; Field of views; Fully automated; Image-based diagnosis; Liver tumor segmentations; Low level image processing; Volumetric segmentations; Computerized tomography"
"Validation of Modified Determinant-Based Classification of severity for acute pancreatitis in a tertiary teaching hospital",2019,"Background: The relative merits of two recent classifications of acute pancreatitis severity, the Determinant-Based Classification (DBC) and the Revised Atlanta Classification (RAC), have been debated. A Modified DBC (MDBC) was recently proposed in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. By dividing the DBC ‘severe’ category into two groups, the MDBC classified non-mild acute pancreatitis into 4 groups rather than 2 in RAC and 3 in DBC. In this study we aim to validate MDBC in both ICU and non-ICU patients and evaluate infected necrosis as a determinant of severity. Methods: Prospective data collected on consecutive patients admitted to a tertiary teaching hospital were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were assigned to the categories of severity defined by the DBC, RAC and MDBC. Clinical interventions and outcomes were compared between categories. Results: A total of 1102 patients were enrolled and the overall mortality was 5.7%. When MDBC was applied, the four Groups were significantly different in regard to ICU admission rates (30%, 40%, 69% and 87%) and mortality (2%, 15%, 40% and 57%). Groups 2 and 3 were different in intervention rates and morbidity, providing evidence that IN is an important determinant of severity. Conclusions: This study validates the MDBC proposal to subdivide the DBC ‘severe’ category into two groups for ICU and non-ICU patients in a tertiary hospital. ? 2019","acute pancreatitis; acute respiratory failure; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; clinical outcome; disease severity; female; human; intensive care unit; kidney failure; length of stay; major clinical study; male; morbidity; mortality; multiple organ failure; pancreas necrosis; priority journal; retrospective study; teaching hospital; validation study; acute disease; classification; complication; factual database; middle aged; pancreatitis; pathology; prospective study; severity of illness index; tertiary care center; very elderly; young adult; biological marker; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Databases, Factual; Female; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Tertiary Care Centers; Young Adult"
"Circulating insulin-like growth factor I in relation to melanoma risk in the European prospective investigation into cancer and nutrition",2019,"Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis, and is thought to play a role in tumour development. Previous prospective studies have shown that higher circulating concentrations of IGF-I are associated with a higher risk of cancers at specific sites, including breast and prostate. No prospective study has examined the association between circulating IGF-I concentrations and melanoma risk. A nested case–control study of 1,221 melanoma cases and 1,221 controls was performed in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, a prospective cohort of 520,000 participants recruited from 10 European countries. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for incident melanoma in relation to circulating IGF-I concentrations, measured by immunoassay. Analyses were conditioned on the matching factors and further adjusted for age at blood collection, education, height, BMI, smoking status, alcohol intake, marital status, physical activity and in women only, use of menopausal hormone therapy. There was no significant association between circulating IGF-I concentration and melanoma risk (OR for highest vs lowest fifth = 0.93 [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.71 to 1.22]). There was no significant heterogeneity in the association between IGF-I concentrations and melanoma risk when subdivided by gender, age at blood collection, BMI, height, age at diagnosis, time between blood collection and diagnosis, or by anatomical site or histological subtype of the tumour (Pheterogeneity?0.078). We found no evidence for an association between circulating concentrations of IGF-I measured in adulthood and the risk of melanoma. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Population health impacts of China's climate change policies",2019,"Rapid and wide-ranging reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are required to meet the climate targets agreed upon at the 2015 Paris climate conference. There will be significant transition risks for health, livelihoods, and ecosystems associated with large-scale mitigation, but also opportunities. The aim of this study was to investigate the impacts, positive and negative, of climate policies on population health in China. We review the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) that China took to the Paris meeting, link commitments in the INDC to national planning documents relevant to environment and health, and search the literature for Chinese publications on health trade-offs and synergies. Synergies are evident in the measures taken to reduce local air pollution in China: controls on coal burning have materially improved local air quality and benefited health. But there may be risks to health also, depending on how policies are implemented and what safeguards are provided. To date most assessments of the health impacts of climate policies in China have been modelling studies. We recommend work of this kind is complemented by observational research to identify unexpected impacts and vulnerabilities. It will become even more important to undertake this work as emission reductions accelerate to meet the Paris climate targets. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","coal; air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; health impact; health risk; national planning; air pollution; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; ecosystem; environmental impact; environmental policy; health hazard; planning; population health; priority journal; China; human; legislation and jurisprudence; China; Air Pollution; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Policy; Humans; Population Health"
"Diabetes knowledge of primary health care and specialist nurses in a major urban area",2019,"Aim and objectives: To examine trends since a previous 2006–2008 survey in diabetes knowledge held by primary health care nurses and their use of national diabetes guidelines, perceived ability to advise diabetes patients and preferences for further diabetes education. Background: The obesity epidemic has led to a rapid increase in the prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes and to greater expectations for an expanded role for primary health care nurses in the prevention and community management of diabetes. Design: Cross-sectional survey using a self-administered questionnaire and telephone interview and adheres to the STROBE guidelines. Methods: All nurses who provide community-based care in a major urban area were identified, and stratified by group, prior to random selection to participate in the study. A total of 1,416 practice, district (home care) and specialist nurses were identified who provide community-based care. Of the 459 who were randomly selected, 336 (73%) participated in 2016 and were compared with a representative sample of 287 nurses surveyed in 2006–2008. Results: Compared with nurses in 2006–2008, significantly more nurses in 2016 used diabetes guidelines, knew that stroke was a diabetes-related complication, had a greater understanding of the pathology of diabetes and reported having sufficient knowledge to advise patients on laboratory results and improving outcomes through lifestyle changes. Despite these improvements, in 2016, only 24% of nurses could state that stroke was a complication of type 2 diabetes, only 37% felt sufficiently knowledgeable to advise patients on medications, and <20% could state that hypertension, smoking and the dyslipidaemia profile were important modifiable risk factors. Conclusion: There have been improvements in nurse's knowledge but gaps remain for cardiovascular outcomes and associated modifiable risk factors and medication management. Relevance to clinical practice: Education programmes should focus on improving cardiovascular risk management in patients with type 2 diabetes. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adult; attitude to health; cross-sectional study; female; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; male; middle aged; New Zealand; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nurse; nurse attitude; nursing; nursing practice; organization and management; primary health care; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Nurse's Role; Nurses, Community Health; Practice Patterns, Nurses'; Primary Health Care"
"Linifanib exerts dual anti-obesity effect by regulating adipocyte browning and formation",2019,"Obesity is caused by energy imbalance and accompanied by adipocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia. Therefore, both enhancement of adipocyte energy expenditure and inhibition of adipogenesis are viable ways to combat obesity. Using the Ucp1-2A-luciferase reporter animal model previously reported by us as a screening platform, a chemical compound Linifanib was identified as a potent inducer of UCP1 expression in primary inguinal adipocytes in vitro and in vivo. Signal pathway analyses showed that Linifanib promoted adipocyte browning by attenuating STAT3 phosphorylation. The effects of Linifanib on adipocyte browning were blocked by the compound, SD19, which activates the STAT3 signaling cascade. Linifanib also inhibited adipocyte differentiation, by blocking mitotic clonal expansion, which could be rescued by STAT3 activator. Taken together, our results indicate that Linifanib might serve as a potential drug for the treatment of obesity. ? 2019","linifanib; STAT3 protein; uncoupling protein 1; antiobesity agent; carbanilamide derivative; indazole derivative; N-(4-(3-amino-1H-indazol-4-yl)phenyl)-N1-(2-fluoro-5-methylphenyl)urea; STAT3 protein; Stat3 protein, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; antiobesity activity; Article; brown adipocyte; cell differentiation; cell expansion; cell metabolism; controlled study; drug effect; drug identification; drug structure; enzyme activation; in vitro study; in vivo study; mitosis; mouse; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipogenesis; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; brown adipocyte; cell culture; dose response; drug effect; metabolism; physiology; randomization; Smegmamorpha; transgenic mouse; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes, Brown; Adipogenesis; Animals; Anti-Obesity Agents; Cells, Cultured; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Indazoles; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Phenylurea Compounds; Random Allocation; Smegmamorpha; STAT3 Transcription Factor"
"Identification of Distinct Arterial Waveform Clusters and a Longitudinal Evaluation of Their Clinical Usefulness",2019,"Clustering of arterial blood pressure (BP) waveform parameters could summarize complex information into distinct elements, which could be used to investigate cumulative (nonredundant) associations. We investigated this hypothesis in a large, adult population-based study (ViDA trial [Vitamin D Assessment] trial). To interpret the clusters and evaluate their usefulness, we examined their predictors and associations with cardiovascular events. In 4253 adults (mean age 65 years; 55% male) without a prior cardiovascular event, suprasystolic oscillometry was performed, yielding aortic pressure waveforms and several hemodynamic parameters. Participants were followed up for 4.6 years (median), accruing 300 cardiovascular events. Principal component analysis reduced 14 arterial waveform parameters to 3 uncorrelated factors that together explained 90% of the variability of the original data. Factors 1, 2, and 3 appeared to represent BP pulsatility, mean BP, and wave reflection, respectively. Across 6 antihypertensive drug classes, there were no differences in brachial systolic (P=0.23) and diastolic (P=0.13) BP; but there were significant variations in factor 3 (P<0.0001), especially for β-blocker use. The first and third factors were positively associated with cardiovascular events (multivariable-adjusted standardized hazard ratio [95% CI]=1.33 [1.18-1.50] and 1.15 [1.02-1.30], respectively), whereas the second factor had a J-shaped relationship, with a nadir corresponding to a brachial diastolic BP of ?75 mm Hg. In conclusion, BP pulsatility, mean BP, and wave reflection are prognostically meaningful, distinct aspects of arterial function that can be used to summarize physiological variations in multiple arterial waveform parameters and identify truly cumulative associations when used as cardiovascular risk outcomes. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.","antihypertensive agent; aged; arterial pressure; brachial artery; controlled study; drug effect; female; hemodynamics; human; hypertension; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; pulse wave; randomized controlled trial; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antihypertensive Agents; Arterial Pressure; Brachial Artery; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hypertension; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Pulse Wave Analysis"
"Comprehensive analysis of body composition and insulin traits associated with intra-pancreatic fat deposition in healthy individuals and people with new-onset prediabetes/diabetes after acute pancreatitis",2019,"Current knowledge of biomarkers of intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IFD) is limited. We aimed to analyse comprehensively body composition and insulin traits as biomarkers of IFD in healthy normoglycaemic individuals as well as in individuals with new-onset prediabetes or diabetes after acute pancreatitis (NODAP). A total of 29 healthy individuals and 34 individuals with NODAP took part in this cross-sectional study. The studied biomarkers belonged to the following domains: body composition (anthropometric and MRI-derived variables); indices of insulin secretion; indices of insulin sensitivity; incretins and related peptides; and pancreatitis-related factors. All MRI-derived variables (including IFD) were measured using ImageJ software. Univariate and step-wise regression analyses were conducted to determine variables that best explained variance in IFD. Visceral fat volume and oxyntomodulin were the best biomarkers of IFD in normoglycaemic healthy individuals, contributing to 64% variance. The Raynaud index was the best biomarker of IFD in individuals with NODAP, contributing to 20% variance. Longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate the cause and effect relationship between oxyntomodulin and IFD in healthy individuals, as well as insulin sensitivity and IFD in individuals with NODAP. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biological marker; incretin; insulin; oxyntomodulin; acute pancreatitis; adult; anthropometry; Article; body composition; clinical article; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; female; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin release; insulin sensitivity; intra-abdominal fat; intrapancreatic fat deposition; lipid storage; longitudinal study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pancreas; prospective study; acute disease; body composition; complication; diabetes mellitus; diabetic complication; diagnostic imaging; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; lipid metabolism; metabolism; normal human; obesity; onset age; pancreas; pancreatitis; pathology; physiology; Acute Disease; Adiposity; Adult; Age of Onset; Body Composition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Lipid Metabolism; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Pancreas; Pancreatitis; Prediabetic State"
"Group A Streptococcus t antigens have a highly conserved structure concealed under a heterogeneous surface that has implications for vaccine design",2019,"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) (Streptococcus pyogenes) is an important human pathogen associated with significant global morbidity and mortality for which there is no safe and efficacious vaccine. The T antigen, a protein that polymerizes to form the backbone of the GAS pilus structure, is a potential vaccine candidate. Previous surveys of the tee gene, which encodes the T antigen, have identified 21 different tee types and subtypes such that any T antigen-based vaccine must be multivalent and carefully designed to provide broad strain coverage. In this study, the crystal structures of three two-domain T antigens (T3.2, T13, and T18.1) were determined and found to have remarkable structural similarity to the previously reported T1 antigen, despite moderate overall sequence similarity. This has enabled reliable modeling of all major two-domain T antigens to reveal that T antigen sequence variation is distributed along the full length of the protein and shields a highly conserved core. Immunoassays performed with sera from immunized animals and commercial T-typing sera identified a significant cross-reactive antibody response between T18.1, T18.2, T3.2, and T13. The existence of shared epitopes between T antigens, combined with the remarkably conserved structure and high level of surface sequence divergence, has important implications for the design of multivalent T antigen-based vaccines.

"Balloon-Expandable Vascular Covered Stent in the Treatment of Iliac Artery Occlusive Disease: 9-Month Results from the BOLSTER Multicenter Study",2019,"Purpose: This study sought to assess the performance of the LIFESTREAM balloon-expandable covered stent for the treatment of iliac artery atherosclerotic lesions. Methods: A total of 155 patients were treated in a prospective, single-arm study at 17 centers in the United States, Europe, and New Zealand. The primary endpoint was a composite of device- or procedure-related death or myocardial infarction (MI)over the course of 30 days, or target lesion revascularization (TLR), major amputation of the target limb, or re-stenosis through 9-months. Secondary endpoints included primary patency, TLR, sustained clinical success, quality of life, and major adverse events (MAE). Results: At 9 months, the primary composite endpoint rate was 16.2% (93.5% confidence interval [CI]: 10.6%–23.2%), primary patency was 89.1% (95% CI: 82.6%–93.7%), and freedom from TLR was 96%. There was a cumulative clinical improvement of at least one Rutherford category from baseline to 9 months of 90.5% (95% CI: 84.3%–94.9%). Quality of life, assessed by using the Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ), demonstrated a mean change in total score from baseline through 9 months of 32.1 ± 26.84; overall, improvements were noted from baseline in each WIQ category. Seven of one-hundred fifty patients (4.7%; 95% CI: 1.9%–9.4%)experienced MAEs, but none were determined to be related to device or procedure. Conclusions: The LIFESTREAM balloon-expandable covered stent provided satisfactory 9-month clinical outcomes including a low rate of target lesion revascularization for the treatment of stenotic and occlusive lesions of the iliac arteries. ? 2019 SIR","politef; adult; adverse event; Article; clinical outcome; Europe; female; follow up; functional assessment; heart infarction; human; iliac artery obstruction; limb amputation; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; New Zealand; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; restenosis; sample size; target lesion revascularization; United States; vascular access; aged; clinical trial; devices; diagnostic imaging; iliac artery; middle aged; pathophysiology; percutaneous transluminal angioplasty; peripheral occlusive artery disease; prosthesis design; stent; time factor; treatment outcome; vascular patency; Aged; Angioplasty, Balloon; Europe; Female; Humans; Iliac Artery; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Peripheral Arterial Disease; Prospective Studies; Prosthesis Design; Stents; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; United States; Vascular Patency"
"Health geography in New Zealand and Australia: global integration or Antipodean exceptionalism?",2019,"This paper examines the hallmarks of an emergent and distinctive Australian and New Zealand health geography over the last 30?years. Building on an assessment of the early development of the sub-discipline in the two countries, a review of published work reveals the co-presence of local themes alongside connections to more global perspectives associated notably with health behaviour. Further common themes are the influence of year-round exposure to outdoor spaces and the proximity of “blue spaces” to urban centres. However, there are divergences in the evolution of the sub-discipline. A comparison of attendance at the biennial International Medical Geography Symposia (held since 1985) with publications in the journal Health & Place reveals differentially globalised characters. A steady flow of international visitors and appointments to New Zealand universities as well as more apparent connections to the wider discipline of geography contrast with more applied geospatial and public health connections in Australian health geography. ? 2019 Institute of Australian Geographers","conference proceeding; health geography; medical geography; public health; quality of life; university sector; Australia; New Zealand"
"Understanding longer-term disability outcomes for M?ori and non-M?ori after hospitalisation for injury: results from a longitudinal cohort study",2019,"Objectives: The objectives are to (1) describe disability outcomes at 24 months after injury and (2) identify factors contributing to disability outcomes at 24 months after injury, for M?ori and non-M?ori who have been hospitalised for injury. Study design: This is a prospective cohort study. Methods: Prospective Outcomes of Injury Study participants were injured New Zealanders aged 18–64 years and recruited from New Zealand's no-fault injury insurer, the Accident Compensation Corporation's entitlement claims register. Data about a number of pre-injury, injury-related and early post-injury characteristics were collected from interviews held at 3 and 24 months after injury. Disability was measured using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule (WHODAS). Modified Poisson regression modelling was used to estimate relative risks (RRs) of disability for M?ori and non-M?ori who were hospitalised for injury. Results: Analyses were restricted to 375 M?ori and 1824 non-M?ori participants for whom complete data were available. Of these, 105 (28%) M?ori and 446 (24%) non-M?ori were hospitalised for their injury. Of these hospitalised groups, 26% of M?ori and 10% of non-M?ori were experiencing disability (WHODAS ?10) at 24 months after injury. M?ori who were hospitalised for injury and who were not working for pay before their injury (RR = 2.7; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.4–4.9), who were experiencing disability before their injury (RR = 3.1; 95% CI 1.6–5.8) or who reported trouble accessing healthcare services for their injury (RR = 2.6; 95% CI 1.3–5.2) were independently at increased risk of disability 24 months after injury. Non-M?ori who were hospitalised for injury and who had inadequate household income before injury (RR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.4–4.1), less than the secondary school qualifications (RR = 2.0; 95% CI 1.1–3.8), were not working for pay before injury (RR = 2.8; 95% CI 1.5–5.1), were experiencing disability before their injury (RR = 3.0; 95% CI 1.7–5.2), had ?2 chronic conditions (RR = 3.5; 95% CI 2.0–6.4) or had body mass index ?30 kg/m2/undisclosed (RR = 2.4; 95% CI 1.3–4.4) were at increased risk of disability 24 months after injury. Conclusions: Variables predicting disability 24 months after injury for M?ori, also predict disability 24 months after injury for non-M?ori, with one notable exception—trouble accessing healthcare services. Our findings show that having access to healthcare services for injury plays an important role after injury and must be focussed on to ensure that the burden of poor injury-related outcomes and injury-related inequities are reduced and ultimately eliminated. ? 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health","cohort analysis; disability; health care; injury; World Health Organization; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cohort analysis; disability; female; health care access; health service; high school; hospitalization; household income; human; information processing; injury; interview; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); New Zealand; New Zealander; personal experience; prospective study; register; risk factor; treatment outcome; adolescent; disabled person; ethnology; hospitalization; injury; middle aged; Oceanic ancestry group; treatment outcome; young adult; New Zealand; Adolescent; Adult; Disabled Persons; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Wounds and Injuries; Young Adult"
"Cross-sectional associations between Ideal Cardiovascular Health scores and vascular phenotypes in 11- to 12-year-olds and their parents: The Longitudinal Study of Australian Children",2019,"Background: Understanding early-life relationships between the Ideal Cardiovascular Health (ICVH) score and vascular phenotypes could inform likely effectiveness and timing of cardiovascular disease prevention strategies. We aimed to describe associations between ICVH scores and vascular phenotypes in 11- to 12-year-old children and their parents. Methods and results: Cross-sectional ICVH scores (range 0–7, higher indicating better health), derived by summing dichotomized metrics for cholesterol, glucose, blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), diet, physical activity and smoking, were constructed for 1235 adults (89% female, mean age 43 years) and 1028 children (48% female, 12 years). The median scores were 4 and 5 for adults and children respectively. Child ICVH scores were associated with parent scores (0.18 higher child score per additional point in parent's score, 95% CI 0.12 to 0.22, P < 0.001). Each additional point in the adult ICVH score was associated with slower carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV, ?0.32 m/s, 95% CI ?0.37 to ?0.27), greater carotid elasticity (0.017%/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.014 to 0.020) and reduced carotid intima-media thickness (IMT, ?7.3 μm, 95% CI ?12.0 to ?2.5). An additional point in the child score was associated with functional phenotypes (PWV ?0.07 m/s, 95% CI ?0.11 to ?0.03; carotid elasticity 0.009%/mm Hg, 95% CI 0.004 to 0.015) but not structural phenotypes (IMT ?1.8 μm, 95% CI ?5.2 to 1.5). Conclusion: Few Australian children and even fewer parents have ideal cardiovascular health. Lower ICVH scores were associated with adverse adult vascular phenotypes and adverse child vascular function. Family-based interventions optimizing ICVH metrics may delay onset and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis and later cardiovascular disease. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","cholesterol; glucose; adult; arterial wall thickness; Article; Australian; blood pressure; body mass; cardiovascular function; carotid artery pulse; child; cholesterol blood level; cross-sectional study; dietary intake; female; femoral artery flow; glucose blood level; groups by age; health status; human; Ideal Cardiovascular Health score; infant; longitudinal study; male; newborn; normal human; parent; peripheral circulation; physical activity; priority journal; scoring system; smoking; Australia; blood; cardiovascular disease; carotid artery; exercise; feeding behavior; femoral artery; health status; middle aged; pathophysiology; phenotype; physiology; procedures; pulse wave; Adult; Australia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Carotid Arteries; Child; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Female; Femoral Artery; Health Status; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Pulse Wave Analysis"
"Patient and carer perceived barriers to early presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer: A systematic review 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1117 Public Health and Health Services 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1112 Oncology and Carcinogenesis",2019,"Background: Lung cancer is typically diagnosed at a late stage. Early presentation and detection of lung cancer symptoms is critical to improving survival but can be clinically complicated and as yet a robust screening method for diagnosis is not available in routine practice. Accordingly, the barriers to help-seeking behaviour and diagnosis need to be considered. This review aimed to document the barriers to early presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer, based on patient and carer perspectives. Methods: A systematic review of databases was performed for original, English language articles discussing qualitative research on patient perceived barriers to early presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer. Three major databases were searched: Scopus, PubMed and EBSCOhost. References cited in the selected studies were searched for further relevant articles. Results: Fourteen studies met inclusion criteria for review. Barriers were grouped into three categories: healthcare provider and system factors, patient factors and disease factors. Conclusions: Studies showed that the most frequently reported barriers to early presentation and diagnosis of lung cancer reported by patients and carers related to poor relationships between GPs and patients, a lack of access to services and care for patients, and a lack of awareness of lung cancer symptoms and treatment. Addressing these barriers offers opportunities by which rates of early diagnosis of lung cancer may be improved. ? 2019 The Author(s).","age; attitude to health; cancer diagnosis; cancer screening; caregiver support; comorbidity; cultural factor; doctor patient relationship; early diagnosis; health care access; health care cost; help seeking behavior; human; lung cancer; patient attitude; personal experience; Review; risk factor; systematic review; early cancer diagnosis; health care delivery; health care personnel; lung tumor; pathology; patient attitude; Early Detection of Cancer; Health Personnel; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Patient Acceptance of Health Care"
"Photoelectrochemical biosensor for hydroxymethylated DNA detection and T4-β-glucosyltransferase activity assay based on WS 2 nanosheets and carbon dots",2019,"5-Hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) plays an important role in switching genes on and off in mammals, and it is implicated in both embryonic development and cancer progression. Herein, a novel photoelectrochemical (PEC) biosensor was developed for 5hmC detection based on WS 2 nanosheets as the photoactive material and boronic acid functionalized carbon dots (B-CDs) for signal amplification unit. This biosensor can also be used for T4-β-glucosyltransferase (β-GT) activity assessment. Firstly, WS 2 nanosheets and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) were immobilized on an ITO electrode surface. Then probe DNA was immobilized on this electrode surface via Au-S bond. Afterwards, the complementary DNA containing 5hmC was then captured on the modified electrode surface by hybridization. Subsequently, β-GT transferred glucose from uridine diphosphoglucose to the hydroxyl groups of the 5hmC residues. After glycosylation, B-CDs could further be immobilized on the modified electrode surface resulting in a strong photocurrent. The PEC biosensor afforded high selectivity, excellent sensitivity and good reproducibility, with detection limits of 0.0034 nM and 0.028 unit/mL for 5hmC and β-GT, respectively. Results demonstrate that the photoelectrochemical strategy introduced here based on WS 2 nanosheets and B-CDs offers a versatile platform for hydroxymethylated DNA detection, β-GT activity assessment and β-GT inhibitor screening. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Bioassay; Biosensors; Carbon; DNA; Electrochemistry; Electrodes; Gold nanoparticles; Mammals; Nanosheets; Photoelectrochemical cells; Tungsten compounds; 5-hydroxymethylcytosine; Carbon dots; Glucosyltransferases; Hydroxymethylation; Modified electrode surfaces; Photoactive materials; Photoelectrochemicals; Signal amplifications; Gold compounds; carbon dot; complementary DNA; glucosyltransferase; gold nanoparticle; hydroxyl group; nanoparticle; nanosheet; t4 beta glucosyltransferase; unclassified drug; uridine diphosphate glucose; WS2 nanosheet; cadmium derivative; carbon; DNA; enzyme inhibitor; glucosyltransferase; gold; metal nanoparticle; Article; chemical bond; chemical phenomena; chemical structure; controlled study; DNA hydroxymethylation; DNA methylation; DNA probe; electron transport; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; genetic screening; glycosylation; hybridization; limit of detection; photoelectrochemical biosensor; Raman spectrometry; reproducibility; selectivity; sensitivity analysis; transmission electron microscopy; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; DNA methylation; electrochemical analysis; electrode; genetic procedures; genetics; human; isolation and purification; nucleic acid hybridization; Biosensing Techniques; Cadmium Compounds; Carbon; DNA; DNA Methylation; Electrochemical Techniques; Electrodes; Enzyme Inhibitors; Glucosyltransferases; Gold; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Nucleic Acid Hybridization"
"Different Types and Acceptability of Psychotherapies for Acute Anxiety Disorders in Children and Adolescents: A Network Meta-analysis",2019,"Importance: Anxiety disorders are common in children and adolescents, and uncertainty remains regarding the optimal strategy of psychotherapies in this population. Objective: To compare and rank the different types of psychotherapies and the different ways of delivering psychological treatments for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents. Data Sources: PubMed, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), ProQuest Dissertations, LILACS (Literatura Latino Americana em Ci?ncias da Sa?de), international trial registers, and US Food and Drug Administration reports were searched from inception to November 30, 2017. Study Selection: Randomized clinical trials that compared any structured psychotherapy with another psychotherapy or a control condition for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents were selected. Data Extraction and Synthesis: Four researchers independently performed data extraction and quality assessment. Pairwise meta-analyses and Bayesian network meta-analysis within the random-effects model were used to synthesize data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Efficacy (change in anxiety symptoms) posttreatment and at follow-up, acceptability (all-cause discontinuation), and quality of life and functional improvement were measured. The certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation framework. Results: A total of 101 unique trials including 6625 unique participants compared 11 different psychotherapies with 4 specific control conditions. The certainty of evidence was rated as low or very low for most comparisons. For efficacy, most psychotherapies were significantly more effective than the wait list condition posttreatment (standardized mean difference [SMD], -1.43 to -0.61) and at the longest follow-up (SMD, -1.84 to -1.64). However, only group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) was significantly more effective than the other psychotherapies and all control conditions posttreatment. For acceptability, bibliotherapy CBT had significantly more all-cause discontinuations than some psychotherapies and control conditions (range of odds ratios, 2.48-9.32). In terms of quality of life and functional improvement, CBT (delivered in different ways) was significantly beneficial compared with psychological placebo and the wait list condition (SMDs, 0.73 to 1.99). Conclusions and Relevance: Group CBT would be the more appropriate choice of psychotherapy for anxiety disorders in children and adolescents, based on these findings. Other types of psychotherapies and different ways of delivering psychological treatment can be alternative options. Further research is needed to explore specific anxiety disorders, disorder-specific psychotherapy, and moderators of treatment effect. ? 2018 Zhou X et al.

"Physiological Concentrations of Blueberry-Derived Phenolic Acids Reduce Monocyte Adhesion to Human Endothelial Cells",2019,"Scope: Blueberry polyphenols are thought to confer cardiovascular health benefits, but have limited bioavailability. They undergo extensive metabolism and their phenolic acid metabolites are likely to be the mediators of bioactivity. The effect of blueberry-derived phenolic acids on one aspect of inflammation, monocyte adhesion to vascular endothelial cells, is investigated. Methods and results: The major blueberry-derived phenolic acids in human plasma are identified and quantified. Three test mixtures representing compounds present at 0–4 h (Early), 4–24 h (Late), or 0–24 h (Whole) are used to investigate the effect on adhesion of monocytes to tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα)–activated endothelial cells. The Late mixture reduces monocyte adhesion, but there is no effect of the Early or Whole mixtures. Exclusion of syringic acid from each mixture results in inhibition of monocyte adhesion. Exposure to the phenolic acid mixtures has no effect on the endothelial surface expression of adhesion molecules intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), or E-selectin, suggesting that other molecular mechanisms are responsible for the observed effect. Conclusion: This study shows that physiological concentrations of blueberry polyphenol metabolites can help maintain cardiovascular health by regulating monocyte adhesion to the vascular endothelium. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Health-related quality of life: Population epidemiology and concordance in Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents",2019,"Objectives To describe the distribution of health-related quality of life (HRQL) in a national sample of Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents, and examine associations within parent-child dyads. Design The Child Health CheckPoint, a populationbased cross-sectional study nested between waves 6 and 7 of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Setting Assessment centres in seven Australian cities and eight regional towns, or home visit; February 2015 to March 2016. Participants Of all participating CheckPoint families (n=1874), 1853 children (49.0% girls) and 1863 parents (87.7% mothers) with HRQL data were included (1786 pairs). Outcome measures HRQL was self-reported using preference-based (Child Health Utility 9Dimension, CHU9D) and non-preference-based (Pediatric Quality of Life, PedsQL V.4.0) measures for children and preferencebased measures for parents (CHU9D; Assessment of Quality of Life 8 Dimension, AQoL-8D). Utility scores from preference-based measures were calculated using existing Australian algorithms to present a score on a 0-1 scale, where 1 represents full health. Parent-child concordance was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients and adjusted linear regression models. Survey weights and methods were applied to account for LSAC's complex sample design, stratification and clustering within postcodes. Results Children's means and SD were 0.81 (SD 0.16) for CHU9D and 78.3 (SD 13.03) for PedsQL. In adults, mean HRQL for AQoL-8D and CHU9D were 0.78 (SD 0.16) and 0.89 (SD 0.10), respectively. Mean HRQL was similar for boys and girls, but slightly higher for fathers than mothers. The Pearson correlation coefficient for parent-child CHU9D values was 0.13 (95% CI 0.09 to 0.18). Percentiles and concordance are presented for both samples for males and females separately and together. Conclusions We provide Australian paediatric population values for HRQL measures, and the first national CHU9D values for mid-life adults. At age 11-12 years in this relatively healthy sample, parent-child concordance in HRQL was small. ? 2019 Author(s).","adult; article; Australian; child; child health; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; father; female; girl; human; human tissue; linear regression analysis; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mother; outcome assessment; quality of life assessment; school child; stratification; correlational study; inheritance; reference value; wellbeing"
"Portrayal of bariatric surgery in the New Zealand print news media",2019,"Background: Bariatric surgery has become topical in the media worldwide, influencing wider societal attitudes towards obesity and obesity management. This study aims to explore the media portrayal of bariatric surgery in all print news articles published in New Zealand (NZ) over a decade. Methods: An electronic search of two databases (Proquest Australia/NZ Newsstream and Newztext) and two NZ news media websites (Stuff and the NZ Herald) was performed to retrieve print news articles reporting stories, opinion pieces or editorials regarding bariatric surgery published between January 2007 to June 2017. Qualitative thematic analysis was performed on all included articles. Results: From January 2007 to December 2017, 252 articles related to bariatric surgery were published. Seven major themes emerged centred around barriers to accessing bariatric surgery, deficit attitudes towards obesity and social justice. These views were driven by articles that debated the limited number of publicly funded bariatric procedures offered in NZ. In addition, healthcare professionals used the media as a platform to challenge discriminatory attitudes towards obesity and bariatric surgery. Conclusion: The NZ media is a powerful tool that still bolsters binary perspectives of obesity and bariatric surgery which may work against addressing the obesity epidemic. ? 2019 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons",""
"Risk of breast cancer in patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis",2019,"Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare metastasizing pulmonary disease that shares some clinical, cellular, and molecular similarities with metastatic breast cancer to lung. LAM cells have been identified circulating in various body fluids of patients and, intriguingly, diverse evidence indicates that these cells may originate from a different organ to the lung. Following on from these observations, we hypothesized the existence of a common risk basis between LAM and breast cancer, and suggested increased risk of breast cancer among LAM patients. Here, by studying two additional LAM cohorts with more detailed epidemiological, life-style, and disease-related data, we show consistent results; a potential excess of estrogen-receptor-positive young breast cancer cases in LAM. This observation further suggests the need of prospective studies to precisely assess the association between both diseases. ? 2019","adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer risk; cohort analysis; epidemiological data; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; female; human; lifestyle; lymphangioleiomyomatosis; metastatic breast cancer; priority journal"
"Metabolic syndrome and time to pregnancy: a retrospective study of nulliparous women",2019,"Objective: To determine: (1) the association between metabolic syndrome (MetS), time to pregnancy (TTP), and infertility; (2) associations between individual and an increasing number of MetS components, TTP, and infertility; and (3) whether these relationships differ by body mass index (BMI?&lt;?30?kg/m2 versus BMI???30?kg/m2). Design: Retrospective cohort study. Setting: Multiple centres (in Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the UK). Population: Five thousand five hundred and nineteen low-risk nulliparous pregnant women. Methods: Data on retrospectively reported TTP (number of months to conceive) and a blood sample to assess metabolic health were collected between 14 and 16?weeks of gestation. MetS was defined according to the International Diabetes Federation criteria. Accelerated failure time models with log-normal distribution were conducted to estimate time ratios (TRs) and 95%?CIs. Differences in MetS on infertility (TTP?&gt;?12?months) were compared using a generalised linear model (Poisson distribution) with robust variance estimates (relative risks, RRs; 95%?CIs). All analyses (entire cohort and split by BMI) were controlled for a range of maternal and paternal confounding factors. Main outcome measures: Time to pregnancy and infertility. Results: Of the 5519 women included, 12.4% (n?=?684) had MetS. Compared with women without MetS, women with MetS had a longer TTP (adjusted TR 1.30; 95%?CI 1.15–1.46), which was similar in women who were obese and in women who were not obese. Marginal estimates for median TTP in women with MetS versus without MetS was 3.1?months (3.0–3.3?months) versus 4.1?months (3.6–4.5?months), respectively. Women with MetS were at a 62% greater risk for infertility and were at a greater risk for infertility whether they were obese (adjusted RR?1.62; 95%?CI 1.15–2.29) or not (adjusted RR 1.73; 95%?CI 1.33–2.23). Reduced high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and raised triglycerides (TGs) were the main individual components associated with risk for infertility. Conclusion: Metabolic syndrome is associated with longer TTP and infertility, independent of obesity. Additional studies, before pregnancy, are required to support our findings and to determine the applicability of which combinations of metabolic abnormalities pose the greatest risk to delayed fertility, or whether individual components are amenable to modification.

"Assessing the impact of the economic crises in 1997 and 2008 on suicides in Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea using a strata-bootstrap algorithm",2019,"The Asian economic crises of 1997 and the 2008 Global Financial Crisis (GFC) had far-reaching impacts on Asian and other global economies. Turmoil in the banking and finance sectors led to downturns in stock markets, resulting in bankruptcies, house repossessions and high unemployment. These crises have been shown to be correlated with a deterioration in mental health and an increase in suicides, and it is important to understand the implication of these impacts and how such recessions affect the health of affected populations. With the benefit of hindsight, did lessons learned from the negative effects of the 1997 Asian economic recession impact the aftermath of the 2008 GFC in Asian countries? Utilising a framework based on a simple strata-bootstrap algorithm using daily data–where available–we investigate the trend in suicide rates over time in three different populations (Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea), and examine whether there were any changes in the pattern of suicide rates in each country subsequent to both the 1997 Asian and 2008. We find that each country responded differently to each of the crises and the suicide rates for certain age-gender specific groups in each country were more affected. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Functional CRISPR and shRNA screens identify involvement of mitochondrial electron transport in the activation of evofosfamide S",2019,"Evofosfamide (TH-302) is a hypoxia-activated DNA-crosslinking prodrug currently in clinical development for cancer therapy. Oxygen-sensitive activation of evofosfamide depends on one-electron reduction, yet the reductases that catalyze this process in tumors are unknown. We used RNA sequencing, whole-genome CRISPR knockout, and reductase-focused short hairpin RNA screens to interrogate modifiers of evofosfamide activation in cancer cell lines. Involvement of mitochondrial electron transport in the activation of evofosfamide and the related nitroaromatic compounds EF5 and FSL-61 was investigated using 143B r0 (r zero) cells devoid of mitochondrial DNA and biochemical assays in UT-SCC-74B cells. The potency of evofosfamide in 30 genetically diverse cancer cell lines correlated with the expression of genes involved in mitochondrial electron transfer. A whole-genome CRISPR screen in KBM-7 cells identified the DNA damage-response factors SLX4IP, C10orf90 (FATS), and SLFN11, in addition to the key regulator of mitochondrial function, YME1L1, and several complex I constituents as modifiers of evofosfamide sensitivity. A reductase-focused shRNA screen in UT-SCC-74B cells similarly identified mitochondrial respiratory chain factors. Surprisingly, 143B r0 cells showed enhanced evofosfamide activation and sensitivity but had global transcriptional changes, including increased expression of nonmitochondrial flavoreductases. In UT-SCC-74B cells, evofosfamide oxidized cytochromes a, b, and c and inhibited respiration at complexes I, II, and IV without quenching reactive oxygen species production. Our results suggest that the mitochondrial electron transport chain contributes to evofosfamide activation and that predicting evofosfamide sensitivity in patients by measuring the expression of canonical bioreductive enzymes such as cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase is likely to be futile.

"Antenatal Detection of Treatable Critical Congenital Heart Disease Is Associated with Lower Morbidity and Mortality",2019,"Objective: To establish the impact that timing of diagnosis and place of birth have on neonatal outcomes in those with readily treatable critical congenital heart disease. Study design: This was a population-based study with a complete national cohort of live-born infants with transposition of the great arteries and aortic arch obstruction in New Zealand between 2006 and 2014. Timing of diagnosis, place of birth, survival to surgery, in-hospital events, and neonatal mortality were reviewed. Live births with a gestation of ?35 weeks and without associated major extracardiac anomalies were included for analysis. Results: A total of 166 live-born infants with transposition of the great arteries and 87 with aortic arch obstruction were included. Antenatal detection increased from 32% in the first 3 years to 47% in the last 3 years (P =.05). During the same period, neonatal mortality decreased from 9% to 1% (P =.02). No deaths occurred after surgical intervention. An antenatal diagnosis was associated with decreased mortality (1/97 [1%] vs 11/156 [7%]; P =.03) and birth outside the surgical center was associated with increased risk of mortality (11/147 [7%] vs 1/106 [1%]; P =.02). Those with an antenatal diagnosis required fewer hours of mechanical ventilation (P =.02) and had shorter durations of hospital stay (P =.05) compared with those diagnosed >48 hours after birth. Conclusions: The mortality risk for transposition of the great arteries and critical aortic arch obstruction is greatest before cardiac surgery. Improved antenatal detection allowing delivery at a surgical center is associated with reduced mortality. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","aortic occlusion; Article; artificial ventilation; cardiovascular mortality; congenital heart disease; female; great vessels transposition; human; infant; length of stay; live birth; major clinical study; male; morbidity; mortality risk; New Zealand; newborn mortality; population research; prenatal diagnosis; prenatal period; priority journal; aortic arch syndrome; complication; great vessels transposition; heart surgery; infant mortality; mortality; newborn; pregnancy; statistics and numerical data; time factor; trends; Aortic Arch Syndromes; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant Mortality; Infant, Newborn; Male; New Zealand; Pregnancy; Prenatal Diagnosis; Time Factors; Transposition of Great Vessels"
"For better or worse: The potential for dose limiting the on-target toxicity of PI 3-kinase inhibitors",2019,"The hyper-activation of the phosphoinositide (PI) 3-kinase signaling pathway is a hallmark of many cancers and overgrowth syndromes, and as a result, there has been intense interest in the development of drugs that target the various isoforms of PI 3-kinase. Given the key role PI 3-kinases play in many normal cell functions, there is significant potential for the disruption of essential cellular functions by PI 3-kinase inhibitors in normal tissues; so-called on-target drug toxicity. It is, therefore, no surprise that progress within the clinical development of PI 3-kinase inhibitors as single-agent anti-cancer therapies has been slowed by the difficulty of identifying a therapeutic window. The aim of this review is to place the cellular, tissue and whole-body effects of PI 3-kinase inhibition in the context of understanding the potential for dose limiting on-target toxicities and to introduce possible strategies to overcome these. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Regional protein expression in human Alzheimer’s brain correlates with disease severity",2019,"Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that currently affects 36 million people worldwide with no effective treatment available. Development of AD follows a distinctive pattern in the brain and is poorly modelled in animals. Therefore, it is vital to widen the spatial scope of the study of AD and prioritise the study of human brains. Here we show that functionally distinct human brain regions display varying and region-specific changes in protein expression. These changes provide insights into the progression of disease, novel AD-related pathways, the presence of a gradient of protein expression change from less to more affected regions and a possibly protective protein expression profile in the cerebellum. This spatial proteomics analysis provides a framework which can underpin current research and open new avenues to enhance molecular understanding of AD pathophysiology, provide new targets for intervention and broaden the conceptual frameworks for future AD research. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Combination urate-lowering therapy in the treatment of gout: What is the evidence?",2019,"Background: Combination therapy that includes a uricosuric and xanthine oxidase inhibitor (XOI) is recommended in guidelines for patients with gout who do not meet treatment targets with XOI monotherapy alone. While the use of combination therapies has been investigated for many years, we reviewed data from the published studies to investigate the efficacy and safety of this approach. Methods: Relevant published papers were identified by keyword search on PubMed and categorized according to the types of combination therapies included. Study methods and results were summarized. Outcomes of combination therapy were compared with respective monotherapies, where possible. Results: Efficacy was assessed by changes in serum urate (sUA), urinary uric acid, gout flare rates, and /or tophi. Safety assessments, where reported, included adverse events and, for more recent studies, laboratory assessments. Early studies in the 1960s based on case reports or open-label designs and more recent, well-designed studies with large patient numbers provided consistent outcomes: that combination therapy with a uricosuric and a XOI provides substantially greater sUA lowering than achieved by either monotherapy. Greater sUA lowering translated to greater gout symptom control, including improved tophus resolution. Conclusions: Combination therapy with a uricosuric and an XOI offers additional sUA lowering compared to monotherapy alone and can provide benefit for achieving therapeutic targets in patients with gout who do not achieve target sUA or are intolerant of XOIs at appropriate monotherapy dosing. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","allopurinol; arhalofenate; benzbromarone; febuxostat; kux 1151; lesinurad; organic anion transporter 1; organic anion transporter 2; placebo; probenecid; rlbn 1001; sulfinpyrazone; tofisopam; topiroxostat; tranilast; unclassified drug; uri 102; uricosuric agent; verinurad; xanthine oxidase inhibitor; antigout agent; uric acid; diarrhea; disease control; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug safety; gastrointestinal disease; gout; headache; human; hyperuricemia; kidney disease; laboratory test; metabolic syndrome X; monotherapy; open study; pain; priority journal; Review; risk assessment; risk benefit analysis; treatment outcome; upper respiratory tract infection; uric acid blood level; blood; combination drug therapy; gout; Drug Therapy, Combination; Gout; Gout Suppressants; Humans; Treatment Outcome; Uric Acid"
"Is an advanced audiology-led service the solution to the paediatric ENT outpatient waiting list problem?",2019,"Purpose: The present study's objective was to predict the effect of an advanced audiology-led clinic on paediatric ENT outpatient waiting lists in a large secondary public hospital. Methods: A retrospective, single observational study was performed to obtain data on all children referred for semi-urgent or routine ENT outpatient assessment over a six month period. Set criteria were used to calculate the proportion of new ENT referrals that could be eligible for a new advanced audiology-led clinic and the effect this could have on ENT outpatient referrals and capacity. Results: Results indicated that 23% of all semi-urgent and routine paediatric ENT outpatient referrals were eligible for referral to an advanced audiology-led clinic, with 74% of these being from the semi-urgent category. Based on these data, an advanced audiology-led clinic was predicted to increase this facility's ENT outpatient capacity by 77%. Conclusion: In conclusion, the introduction of an advanced audiology-led service could significantly reduce waiting lists and increase capacity in paediatric ENT outpatient services in the public healthcare system. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","article; audiology; child; female; health care system; hospital admission; human; male; observational study; outpatient care; patient referral; public hospital; retrospective study; scope of practice"
"Comparison of higher order wavefront aberrations with four aberrometers",2019,"Purpose: To evaluate the agreement of selected higher order aberration measurements between aberrometers based on three different wavefront technologies. Methods: Twenty-three eyes of 23 participants were compared between Zywave, OPD-Scan III, and iDesign aberrometers, for total ocular aberrations. Participants were between 19 and 69 years of age, and exclusion criteria were previous ocular surgery or trauma, contact lens wear within the preceding 2 weeks, and ocular or systemic disease. Corneal aberrations were compared between the OPD-Scan III and GALILEI? G2 aberrometers. Zernike coefficients of vertical and oblique trefoil, vertical and horizontal coma, and spherical aberration were analyzed in R software. Results: In all, 276 scans were captured in total, with a male-to-female ratio of 11:12. Total ocular vertical coma [mean difference (MD) = 0.026 μm, P &lt; 0.005], vertical trefoil (MD = 0.033 μm, P &lt; 0.05), and spherical aberration (MD = 0.022 μm, P &lt; 0.05) differed significantly between the iDesign and OPD-Scan III. Differences in total vertical (MD = 0.072 μm, P &lt; 0.05) and oblique trefoil (MD = 0.058 μm, P &lt; 0.05) were demonstrated between the Zywave and OPD-Scan III, and spherical aberration (MD = 0.030 μm, P &lt; 0.005) between iDesign and Zywave. iDesign corneal horizontal coma (MD = 0.025 μm, P &lt; 0.05) and spherical aberration (MD = 0.043 μm, P &lt; 0.005) measurements were significantly different between the GALILEI? G2 and the OPD-Scan III. Conclusion: Zywave, iDesign, and OPD-Scan III, and GALILEITM G2 and OPD-Scan III may be used interchangeably for their total ocular and corneal wavefront functions, respectively; however, care must be taken if using these devices for guiding ablation or monitoring corneal disease. ? 2019 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","aberrometry; adult; aged; cornea; corneal wavefront aberration; diagnostic imaging; eye refraction; female; follow up; human; male; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; prospective study; visual acuity; young adult; Aberrometry; Adult; Aged; Cornea; Corneal Wavefront Aberration; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Refraction, Ocular; Visual Acuity; Young Adult"
"Foods, macronutrients and breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women: A large UK cohort",2019,"Background: The role of diet in breast cancer aetiology is unclear; recent studies have suggested associations may differ by estrogen receptor status. Methods: Baseline diet was assessed in 2000-04 using a validated questionnaire in 691 571 postmenopausal UK women without previous cancer, who had not changed their diet recently. They were followed by record linkage to national cancer and death databases. Cox regression yielded adjusted relative risks for breast cancer for 10 food items and eight macronutrients, subdivided mostly into five categories of baseline intake. Trends in risk across the baseline categories were calculated, assigning re-measured intakes to allow for measurement error and changes in intake over time; P-values allowed for multiple testing. Results: Women aged 59.9 (standard deviation (SD 4.9)) years at baseline were followed for 12 (SD 3) years; 29 005 were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. Alcohol intake had the strongest association with breast cancer incidence: relative risk (RR) 1.08 [99% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.11] per 10 g/day higher intake, P ? 5.8 1014. There were inverse associations with fruit: RR 0.94 (99% CI 0.92-0.97) per 100 g/day higher intake, P ? 1.1 106, and dietary fibre: RR 0.91 (99% CI 0.87-0.96) per 5 g/day increase, P ? 1.1 104. Fruit and fibre intakes were correlated (q ? 0.62) and were greater among women who were not overweight, so residual confounding cannot be excluded. There was no heterogeneity for any association by estrogen receptor status. Conclusions: By far the strongest association was between alcohol intake and an increased risk of breast cancer. Of the other 17 intakes examined, higher intakes of fruit and fibre were associated with lower risks of breast cancer, but it is unclear whether or not these associations are causal. ?

"Metabolic analysis of adipose tissues in a rodent model of pre-pregnancy maternal obesity combined with offsprings on high-carbohydrate diet",2019,"Maternal obesity is associated with adverse effects on the health of offsprings. Consumption of a high-carbohydrate (HC) diet has been found to promote abnormal fatty acid metabolism in adipose tissue. Therefore, we hypothesised that maternal obesity combined with an offspring HC diet would alter the fatty acid metabolism of adipose tissue and subsequently contribute to offspring obesity. Leprdb/+ mice were used to model pre-pregnancy maternal obesity and the C57BL/6 wildtype were used as a control group. Offspring were fed either HC diet or a normal-carbohydrate (NC) diet after weaning. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) were collected from offspring at 20 weeks of age and their fatty acid metabolome was characterized using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found that HC diet increased the body weight of offspring (males increased by 14.70% and females increased by 1.05%) compared to control mothers. However, maternal obesity alone caused a 7.9% body weight increase in female offspring. Maternal obesity combined with an offspring HC diet resulted in dynamic alterations of the fatty acid profiles of adipose tissue in male offspring. Under the impact of a HC diet, the fatty acid metabolome was solely elevated in female WAT, whereas, the fatty acid metabolites in BAT showed a similar trend in the male and female offsprings. 6,9-octadecadienoic acid and 12,15-cis-octadecatrienoic acid were significantly affected in female WAT, in response to offspring consumption of a HC diet. Our study demonstrated that maternal obesity and offspring HC diet have different metabolic effects on adipose tissue in male and female offsprings. ? 2019","cholesterol; glucose; insulin; saturated fatty acid; unsaturated fatty acid; adipose tissue; animal experiment; animal model; Article; blood pressure; body weight; brown adipose tissue; carbohydrate diet; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; fatty acid metabolism; female; genotype; glucose blood level; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin blood level; loss of function mutation; macronutrient; male; mass fragmentography; maternal obesity; metabolomics; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; spontaneous mutation; white adipose tissue"
"Telomere length: Population epidemiology and concordance in Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents",2019,"Objectives To (1) describe the epidemiology of child and adult telomere length, and (2) investigate parent-child telomere length concordance. Design Population-based cross-sectional study within the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Setting Assessment centres in seven major Australian cities and eight selected regional towns; February 2015 to March 2016. Participants Of 1874 participating families, telomere data were available for analysis for 1206 children and 1343 parents, of whom 1143 were parent-child pairs. There were 589 boys and 617 girls; 175 fathers and 1168 mothers. Outcome measures Relative telomere length (T/S ratio), calculated by comparing telomeric DNA (T) level with the single copy (S) beta-globin gene in venous blood-derived genomic DNA by quantitative real-time PCR. Results Mean T/S ratio for all children, boys and girls was 1.09 (SD 0.56), 1.05 (SD 0.53) and 1.13 (SD 0.59), respectively. Mean T/S ratio for all parents, fathers and mothers was 0.81 (SD 0.37), 0.82 (SD 0.36) and 0.81 (SD 0.38), respectively. Parent-child T/S ratio concordance was moderate (correlation 0.24). In adjusted regression models, one unit higher parent T/S ratio was associated with 0.36 (estimated linear regression coefficient (β); 95% CI 0.28 to 0.45) higher child T/S ratio. Concordance was higher in the youngest parent-age tertile (β 0.49; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.64) compared with the middle (β 0.35; 95% CI 0.21 to 0.48) and oldest tertile (β 0.26; 95% CI 0.11 to 0.41; p-trend 0.04). Father-child concordance was 0.34 (95% CI 0.18 to 0.48), while mother-child was 0.22 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.28). Conclusions We provide telomere length population values for children aged 11-12 years and their mid-life parents. Relative telomere length was shorter in adults than children, as expected. There was modest evidence of parent-child concordance, which diminished with increasing parent age. ? 2019 Author(s).","genomic DNA; hemoglobin beta chain; Article; Australian; blood sampling; body mass; child; child parent relation; comparative study; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; female; globin gene; health care policy; home visit; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; parental age; real time polymerase chain reaction; sex difference; telomere length"
"Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis: Some reduction in a disease of disparities",2019,"Aim: A retrospective Auckland-wide (total population approximately 1.4 million) study of hospital admissions from 2007 to 2015 was conducted to assess trends in admissions for acute post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis (APSGN) in children aged 0–14 years. Methods: International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD10) discharge codes were used to identify potential cases of APSGN, and electronic clinical records and laboratory data were compared with established case definitions for definite or probable APSGN. Results: A total of 430 cases of APSGN were identified (definite n = 337, probable n = 93), with a mean annual incidence of 15.2/100 000 (95% confidence interval (CI) 14.9–15.6). Incidence (0–14 years) was 17 times higher in Pacific peoples (50.2/100 000, 95% CI 48.6–51.8) and almost 7 times higher in M?ori (19.6/100 000, 95% CI 18.6–20.7) than European/other populations (2.9/100 000, 95% CI 2.7–3.1). Multivariate analysis found ethnicity, deprivation, male gender, age (peak 3–8 years) and season (summer/autumn) to be associated with admission risk. Admission rates showed a significant change of ?9.0% (95% CI ?10.4, 7.4%) per year, with 2011 being an exception. Low C3 complement, hypertension, elevated streptococcal titres, oedema and heavy proteinuria were present in 94, 65, 67, 52 and 49% of cases, respectively. Relying on ICD10 codes without further review of clinical notes would result in an overcount of cases by 25%. Conclusions: There is severe disparity in APSGN admission rates, with a disproportionate burden of disease for Pacific and M?ori children and those living in deprived circumstances. Rates trended downward from 2007 to 2015. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","adolescent; age; allergic glomerulonephritis; antibody titer; Article; child; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; comorbidity; controlled study; disease severity; electronic medical record; ethnicity; female; gender; health disparity; hospital admission; human; ICD-10; incidence; infant; kidney function; male; New Zealand; priority journal; proteinuria; retrospective study; risk factor; seasonal variation; trend study"
"Contributory factors and potentially avoidable neonatal encephalopathy associated with acute peripartum events: An observational study",2019,"Background: In 25% of affected babies, neonatal encephalopathy results from acute peripartum events, but rigorous review of these cases for quality improvement is seldom reported. New Zealand has maintained a national database of all babies diagnosed with Sarnat moderate and severe neonatal encephalopathy since 2010 under the Perinatal and Maternal Mortality Review Committee. Aims: To determine the rate of contributory factors, potentially avoidable mortality or morbidity, and to identify key areas for improvements to maternity and neonatal care among cases of neonatal encephalopathy following an acute peripartum event. Materials and methods: Sarnat moderate and severe cases identified from the national collection of neonatal encephalopathy with a history of an acute peripartum event were reviewed using a standardised independent multidisciplinary methodology and a tool for assessing contributory factors and potential avoidability, with the addition of a human factors lens. Results: Forty-seven cases from 2013 to 2015 were reviewed. The most common acute peripartum events were placental abruption (12) and shoulder dystocia (11). Contributory factors were identified in 89%, and the severity of outcome was potentially avoidable in 66%. Key modifiable areas included dynamic risk assessment, preparedness for obstetric and neonatal emergencies, best practice for maternal and fetal surveillance in labour, and documentation. Conclusions: There is significant potential to improve quality and safety in acute peripartum care to reduce the risk of neonatal encephalopathy. Human factors were not well captured by the clinical notes or review tool. Attention to human factors by improved methodology can enhance review of neonatal encephalopathy. ? 2019 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists","Apgar score; Article; brain disease; breech presentation; clinical article; disease severity; human; labor; maternal care; multiple pregnancy; newborn; newborn care; newborn disease; newborn mortality; observational study; perinatal period; priority journal; risk assessment; shoulder dystocia; solutio placentae; umbilical cord prolapse; uterus rupture"
"Acute Changes of Bile Acids and FGF19 After Sleeve Gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass",2019,"Context: Gastric bypass (GBP) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG) are both effective bariatric treatments that cause sustained weight loss as well as improvement of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The underlying mechanisms are under investigation, including the contribution of alterations in bile acids (BAs) in achieving or maintaining the beneficial metabolic effects after bariatric surgery. Aims: The aim of this study is to investigate the acute and short-term effects of GBP and SG on BA compositions and fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) in obese individuals with T2DM and to evaluate any correlations between changes in these measures with glucose metabolic improvements. Methods: The levels of both fasting and postprandial plasma BA compositions after oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), fasting FGF19 and various metabolic indices were measured 1?day before and at 3?days and 3?months after GBP and SG in 19 obese patients (GBP = 8, SG = 11) with T2DM. Results: Body weight loss was observed after both GBP and SG 3?months post-operatively, with no significant difference between the two intervention groups (15.0 ± 3.1% vs. 13.9 ± 5.2%, P = 0.761). At 3?days post-operation, FGF19 levels increased significantly in both surgery groups (GBP, 118.3 ± 57.3 vs. 363.6 ± 131.0?pg?mL?1, post-operation P = 0.008; SG, 173.2 ± 127.8 vs. 422.0 ± 243.6?pg?mL?1, post-operation P = 0.001). Fasting and postprandial increases from pre-operative values in secondary (r = 0.57, P = 0.02; r = 0.58, P = 0.01), conjugated (r = 0.50, P = 0.01; r = 0.48, P = 0.04), glycine-conjugated (r = 0.52, P = 0.05; r = 0.46, P = 0.05) and secondary-conjugated (r = 0.53, P = 0.02; r = 0.60, P = 0.01) BAs correlated with decreases in the postprandial states of glucose (defined by area under the curve (AUC) over 120?min (AUC0-120min)). Increases in postprandial primary-conjugated BAs were found to be associated with decreases in HOMA-IR (r = 0.45, P = 0.05). However, increases in fasting and postprandial taurine-conjugated BA correlated with decreases in both basal insulin secretion rate (r = 0.47, P = 0.04; r = 0.48, P = 0.04) and C-peptide level (r = 0.45, P = 0.05; r = 0.47, P = 0.04). After 3?months, fasting and postprandial increases in secondary (r = 0.51, P = 0.03; r = 0.48, P = 0.04), secondary-conjugated (r = 0.52, P = 0.02; r = 0.51, P = 0.03) and non-12α-OH (r = 0.51, P = 0.02; r = 0.58, P = 0.01) BAs were found to correlate with increases in Stumvoll Insulin Sensitivity Index. Increases in both fasting and postprandial 12α-OH BAs were correlated with the decreases in glucose AUC (r = 0.46, P = 0.05; r = 0.41, P = 0.04). Conclusions: Both GBP and SG achieve increases in many BA species as early as 3?days post-operation, which are sustained at 3?months post-operation. Rises in secondary BA and conjugated forms are correlated with early improvements in glucose metabolism at 3?days post-operation. These along with 12α-OH BA correlated with improved glucose metabolism at 3?months post-operation, suggesting they may contribute to the observed T2DM remission after bariatric surgery. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","bile acid; C peptide; chenodeoxycholic acid; cholic acid; deoxycholic acid; fibroblast growth factor 19; glipizide; glucose; glycine; ibuprofen; incretin; insulin; lithocholic acid; metformin; taurine; ursodeoxycholic acid; adult; area under the curve; Article; biochemical analysis; body weight; body weight loss; clinical article; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; fasting; female; glucose metabolism; homeostasis model assessment; human; insulin release; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obese patient; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; postoperative care; postprandial state; preoperative care; priority journal; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; short course therapy; sleeve gastrectomy; therapy effect"
"Failed Debridement and Implant Retention Does Not Compromise the Success of Subsequent Staged Revision in Infected Total Knee Arthroplasty",2019,"Background: Periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is the leading cause of early revisions after total knee arthroplasty. Debridement, antibiotics, and implant retention (DAIR) procedures are often the initial treatment for PJI. However, there is concern that failed DAIR undermines the future success of revision procedures. This study aims to investigate the impact of DAIR on the success of subsequent staged revisions for PJI. Methods: A multicenter retrospective review was performed over a 15-year period. Treatment success was defined as implant retention without the use of long-term suppressive antibiotics. This was compared between patients who underwent a staged revision as the first procedure for PJI (staged-only) and patients who failed DAIR before staged revision (F-DAIR). Competing risk survival analysis was performed to compare the 2 groups and considered for patient demographics, American Society of Anesthesiologists score, organism type, body mass index, age of prosthesis, and duration of symptoms. Results: Of 291 eligible patients, 63 underwent staged revision and 228 underwent DAIR as the first procedure for PJI. Of the 228 DAIR patients, 75 failed DAIR and underwent subsequent staged revision (F-DAIR). At mean follow-up of 6.2 years, the success rate was 72% in the F-DAIR group and 81% in the staged-only group. On survival analysis, there was no significant difference in subdistribution hazard ratio comparing the probability of failure (implant retention) in the 2 treatments groups (subdistribution hazard ratio = 0.72; 95% confidence interval 0.32-1.61; P = .42). Conclusion: This study suggested that a previously failed DAIR does not compromise the success rate of a subsequent staged revision. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; age; aged; American Society of Anesthesiologists score; Article; body mass; clinical outcome; controlled study; debridement; demography; disease duration; female; follow up; human; implant retention; major clinical study; male; middle aged; periprosthetic joint infection; retrospective study; scoring system; survival analysis; total knee arthroplasty; treatment failure"
"Associations between gastrointestinal humoral factors and pancreatic proteolytic enzymes in alcohol-related versus non-alcohol-related pancreatitis",2019,"Background: Alcohol-related pancreatitis is common and the gastrointestinal tract plays an important role in the regulation of pancreatic exocrine function. While the relationship between pancreatic proteolytic enzymes and insulin (as well as other pancreatic hormones) has been investigated in detail, little is known about the relationship between pancreatic proteolytic enzymes and gastrointestinal humoral factors. The aim of this study was to study the associations between trypsin, chymotrypsin, and a panel of gastrointestinal humoral factors in patients after an episode of alcohol-related versus non-alcohol-related pancreatitis. Methods: Fasting venous blood samples were analyzed for trypsin, chymotrypsin, cholecystokinin, gastrin, ghrelin, gastrin-related peptide, neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, secretin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide. Linear regression analysis was used in three statistical models, adjusting for covariates (age, sex, ethnicity, smoking, exercise, body mass index, dysglycemia, recurrence of pancreatitis, duration of pancreatitis, and severity of pancreatitis). Results: The study included 21 patients with alcohol-related pancreatitis and 72 with non-alcohol-related pancreatitis. Gastrin, cholecystokinin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide were significantly associated with chymotrypsin in all three statistical models and resulted in a 1.06, 1.98, and 2.74 times higher chymotrypsin level in alcohol-related pancreatitis, respectively. Ghrelin was significantly associated with trypsin in all three statistical models and resulted in a 2.64 times higher trypsin level in alcohol-related pancreatitis. Other associations did not demonstrate a consistent significant pattern. Conclusion: In alcohol-related pancreatitis, several gut-related peptides are significantly associated with pancreatic exocrine function. Further studies to investigate the effect of alcohol on the interaction between cholecystokinin (as well as gastrin, ghrelin, and vasoactive intestinal peptide) and pancreatic exocrine function are warranted. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","cholecystokinin; chymotrypsin; gastrin; ghrelin; glucose; humoral antibody; insulin; neuropeptide; neuropeptide Y; pancreas hormone; peptide; peptide YY; proteinase; secretin; trypsin; vasoactive intestinal polypeptide; adult; alcohol related pancreatitis; Article; body mass; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; disease duration; disease severity; dysglycemia; ethnicity; exercise; female; glucose homeostasis; human; linear regression analysis; major clinical study; male; non alcohol related pancreatitis; pancreatitis; sex; smoking"
"What does critical health education in schools look like? Two ethnographic narratives of critical practice",2019,"Background: Many health education scholars over the last 20 years have argued that critical approaches to the discipline are needed. Despite these calls, there are few published examples of actual critical practice in action in school classrooms. Some have argued that part of the explanation for this lacuna lies in a dichotomy in the field between ‘traditional’ approaches to health education and more critical approaches. Purpose and Methods: This article draws on an ethnographic study of schools in Aotearoa New Zealand and shares two different narratives of what we identify as critical approaches to health education. New Zealand is unique in that health education is a credentialed subject in senior high school that allows access to national qualifications. We outline the approaches of two different teachers within this system, and evaluate these alongside key literature in the field, and five pedagogical themes. Conclusions: Teachers who engage with critical classroom practice are also likely to include traditional and biomedical teaching approaches. Rather than viewing this as problematic, we argue that health education programmes that value criticality will also value traditional forms of health knowledge, while simultaneously questioning them. Such an approach is necessarily messy but is more successful when teachers embrace a pedagogy of uncertainty. ?

"Human urine metabolomic signature after ingestion of polyphenol-rich juice of purple grumixama (Eugenia brasiliensis Lam.)",2019,"Polyphenol intake has been associated with health promotion because of its interaction with several metabolic pathways. This study investigates changes in the urine metabolome following acute intake of polyphenol-rich juice, purple grumixama juice. Grumixama (Eugenia brasiliensis Lam.) is a cherry native to Brazil that is known to be a rich source of anthocyanins and ellagitannins. In this research 15 healthy subjects consumed a single dose of grumixama juice. Urine samples were collected before grumixama juice intake, 0–1, 1–2, 2–4 h, with fasting at 24 h after intake. Plasma samples were also collected before intake, 30′ and at 1 h, 2 h and 4 h, with fasting at 24 h after juice intake. The urine primary metabolites were analysed by a metabolomic approach using gas chromatography mass spectrometry with methyl chloroformate derivatisation for amino acids and organic acids. Also, an oxygen radical absorbance capacity method was carried out to evaluate the plasma samples antioxidant capacity changes. Subjects showed increase in plasma antioxidant capacity after juice intake (p-values < .05). A total of 114 metabolites were assessed in urine (1–2 h and 2–4 h), including 17 amino acids, 47 organic acids and several other metabolites. Among the 114 metabolites, 25 were significantly changed during the first 4 h following juice intake, as shown by the Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (0.5 > p(corr) > 0.3) and univariate analysis (p-values < .05). Some metabolites were related to mitochondrial metabolism, such as glyoxylic acid and oxalic acid. Metabolites related to amino acid metabolism were also changed, such as beta-alanine, L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine. In conclusion, results suggest that acute intake of grumixama juice could affect amino acid metabolism and mitochondrial metabolism, but the related health implications should be explored in further studies using additional approaches. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Amino acids; Anthocyanins; Antioxidants; Biomolecules; Body fluids; Discriminant analysis; Essential oils; Gas chromatography; Least squares approximations; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Metabolites; Physiology; Amino acid metabolism; Ellagitannins; Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry; Metabolomics; Methyl chloroformate; Mitochondrial metabolism; Oxygen radical absorbance capacities; Partial least squares - discriminant analysis; Oxalic acid"
"Impact of training and professional development on health management and leadership competence: A mixed methods systematic review",2019,"Purpose: Training to improve health management and leadership competence is recommended. However, there is limited evidence showing the impact of training on competence. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the evidence for the impact of training and professional development on health management and leadership competence. Design/methodology/approach: A systematic review was conducted using a mixed-methods design. Studies using qualitative, quantitative or mixed-methods design were included. The following electronic databases were searched to October 2018: CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, ERIC, NEDLINE and PsycINFO. Study eligibility and methodological quality were assessed independently by two review authors. Data from qualitative studies were synthesised using thematic analysis. For quantitative studies, odds ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for each intervention. Where appropriate, qualitative and quantitative data were integrated into a single synthesis using Bayesian methods. Findings: In total, 19 studies were identified for inclusion in the review. Training and professional development interventions using flexible, multiple training techniques tailored to organisational contexts can improve individual competence and performance. Such training is typified by a leadership development programme. There was insufficient evidence to determine the effects of interventions on organisational performance. Originality/value: This is the first systematic review evaluating the impact of training and professional development interventions on health management and leadership competence. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","article; Cinahl; Embase; health care management; human; leadership; professional development; PsycINFO; qualitative research; quantitative analysis; synthesis; systematic review; thematic analysis; education; health care facility; hospital management; professional competence; psychology; Health Facility Administration; Health Facility Administrators; Humans; Leadership; Professional Competence"
"Characterization of cardiovascular clinical events and impact of event adjudication on the treatment effect of darapladib versus placebo in patients with stable coronary heart disease: Insights from the STABILITY trial",2019,"Background: Clinical Endpoint Classification (CEC) in clinical trials allows FOR standardized, systematic, blinded, and unbiased adjudication of investigator-reported events. We quantified the agreement rates in the STABILITY trial on 15,828 patients with stable coronary heart disease. Methods: Investigators were instructed to report all potential events. Each reported event was reviewed independently by 2 reviewers according to prespecified processes and prespecified end point definitions. Concordance between reported and adjudicated cardiovascular (CV) events was evaluated, as well as event classification influence on final study results. Results: In total, CEC reviewed 7,096 events: 1,064 deaths (696 CV deaths), 958 myocardial infarctions (MI), 433 strokes, 182 transient ischemic attacks, 2,052 coronary revascularizations, 1,407 hospitalizations for unstable angina, and 967 hospitalizations for heart failure. In total, 71.8% events were confirmed by CEC. Concordance was high (>80%) for cause of death and nonfatal MI and lower for hospitalization for unstable angina (25%) and heart failure (50%). For the primary outcome (composite of CV death, MI, and stroke), investigators reported 2,086 events with 82.5% confirmed by CEC. The STABILITY trial treatment effect of darapladib versus placebo on the primary outcome was consistent using investigator-reported events (hazard ratio 0.96 [95% CI 0.87– 1.06]) or adjudicated events (hazard ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.85– 1.03]). Conclusions: The primary outcome results of the STABILITY trial were consistent whether using investigator-reported or CEC-adjudicated events. The proportion of investigator-reported events confirmed by CEC varied by type of event. These results should help improve event identification in clinical trials to optimize ascertainment and adjudication. ? 2018 The Authors","darapladib; benzaldehyde derivative; darapladib; oxime; phospholipase A2 inhibitor; placebo; adult; Article; cause of death; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; heart failure; heart infarction; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle revascularization; hospitalization; human; ischemic heart disease; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; priority journal; transient ischemic attack; unstable angina pectoris; bioassay; cerebrovascular accident; complication; coronary artery disease; heart failure; heart infarction; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; percutaneous coronary intervention; randomized controlled trial; transient ischemic attack; unstable angina pectoris; Angina, Unstable; Benzaldehydes; Coronary Disease; Endpoint Determination; Heart Failure; Hospitalization; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Myocardial Infarction; Oximes; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Phospholipase A2 Inhibitors; Placebos; Stroke"
"Cooperative interactions between trichomonas vaginalis and associated bacteria enhance paracellular permeability of the cervicovaginal epithelium by dysregulating tight junctions",2019,"The human protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis is the causative agent of trichomoniasis, a prevalent sexually transmitted infection, which is accompanied by a species-diversified vaginal microbiota named community state type IV (CST-IV). Coincidently, CST-IV includes species associated with bacterial vaginosis (e.g. Gardnerella vaginalis, Atopobium vaginae, and Prevotella bivia). Both diseases are linked to the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and preterm birth, which complications are likely to result from the disruption of the cervicovaginal epithelial barrier. Here, we show that paracellular permeability of fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-dextran through a monolayer of human ectocervical cells (hECs) is increased as a consequence of the activity of T. vaginalis and the aforementioned species of CST-IV bacteria cooperatively. T. vaginalis enhances paracellular permeability of hECs two times more than the individual bacterial species, by up to ~10% versus ~5%, respectively. However, any two or all three bacterial species are capable of synergizing this effect. T. vaginalis and the bacteria together increase the paracellular permeability of hECs by ~50%, which is 5 to 10 times more than the results seen with the protozoan or bacteria alone. This effect is accompanied by enhancement of phosphatase activity, while phosphatase inhibition results in preservation of the integrity of the ectocervical cell monolayer. In addition, these microorganisms induce changes in the expression of tight junction proteins, particularly occludin, and of proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF- α). Together, our findings establish that cooperative interactions between CST-IV bacteria and T. vaginalis enhance the paracellular permeability of the cervicovaginal epithelium by disturbing the integrity of the tight junction complex. Our study results highlight the importance of understanding the contribution of the vaginal microbiota to trichomoniasis. ? 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

"Age but no sex effects on subareas of the amygdala",2019,"The amygdala, an anatomical composite of several nuclei that have been grouped anatomically and functionally into three major subareas, has been reported to decrease in size with increasing age and to differ in size between male and female brains. However, findings are rather inconsistent across existing studies, possibly reflecting differences in the cohorts examined or the approaches chosen to define and measure the dimensions of the amygdala. Here, we investigated possible effects of age and sex on the amygdala as well as age-by-sex interactions in 100 healthy subjects (50 men/50 women) aged 18–69 years. For this purpose, we enhanced conventional imaging-based information with microscopically defined cytoarchitectonic probabilities to discriminate between different subareas. We observed significant negative correlations between age and all subareas of the amygdala indicating decreases over time, but with subarea-specific trajectories. In addition, we detected a significant quadratic association with age for the left superficial subarea suggesting an accelerating volume loss over time. Such regional information may serve as a frame of reference in future studies, not only for normative samples but also potentially for clinical populations known to present with an atypical atrophy of the amygdala. There were no sex differences and no interactions between sex and age, suggesting that the size of the amygdala is similar in male and female brains (at least when properly accounting for total intracranial volume) and that its age-related decline follows a similar trajectory in both sexes. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","adult; age; aged; aging; amygdala; Article; brain; female; gender; gray matter; human; major clinical study; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; respect; sex; sex difference; tissue section"
"Acute arterial cardiovascular events risk in patients with primary membranous nephropathy",2019,"Background: Venous thromboembolism is a well established risk in patients with primary membranous nephropathy (MN) due to deficiency in natural anti-coagulants. Recent studies suggested a higher risk of arterial thrombotic events as well in this group. Aim: To identify that risk in our cohort. Methods: We reviewed the data of all patients who had biopsy proven primary MN at our institute between 2003 and 2013. Clinical data were retrospectively reviewed until November 2016. The cardiovascular (CV) events, including acute coronary syndromes and strokes were determined and included only if occurred after the diagnosis of the nephropathy. Results: A total of 204 patients had biopsy proven MN. Follow up information was available for 166 patients. Thirty-one patients (18.6%) developed CV events during follow up. Thirty-eight per cent of total events occurred within 1 year of MN diagnosis. Forty-two per cent of those who developed CV events were not on anti-thrombotic medications and 60% were not on statin therapy. Male gender, age, diabetes and absence of statins therapy were associated with higher rates of CV events in this group. Conclusion: There is an increased risk of arterial events in patients with primary MN. This risk is greatest in the first year of diagnosis. The risk should be highlighted in this group of patients and anti-platelets and statin therapy should be considered especially during the initial phase of the disease. ? 2019 Royal Australasian College of Physicians","anticoagulant agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; acute coronary syndrome; acute disease; adult; age distribution; aged; artery thrombosis; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; medical record review; membranous glomerulonephritis; priority journal; retrospective study; sex difference; thrombosis prevention; very elderly; adolescent; cardiovascular disease; membranous glomerulonephritis; middle aged; pathophysiology; risk factor; young adult; Acute Disease; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glomerulonephritis, Membranous; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Young Adult"
"A targeted promotional DVD fails to improve M?ori and Pacific participation rates in the New Zealand bowel screening pilot: Results from a pseudo-randomised controlled trial",2019,"Background: New Zealand's Bowel Screening Pilot (BSP) used a mailed invitation to return a faecal immunochemical test. As a pilot it offered opportunities to test interventions for reducing ethnic inequities in colorectal cancer screening prior to nationwide programme introduction. Small media interventions (e.g. educational material and DVDs) have been used at both community and participant level to improve uptake. We tested whether a DVD originally produced to raise community awareness among the M?ori population would have a positive impact on participation and reduce the proportion of incorrectly performed tests (spoiled kits) if mailed out with the usual reminder letter. Methods: The study was a parallel groups pseudo-randomised controlled trial. Over 12 months, all M?ori and Pacific ethnicity non-responders four weeks after being mailed the test kit were allocated on alternate weeks to be sent, or not, the DVD intervention with the usual reminder letter. The objective was to determine changes in participation and spoiled kit rates in each ethnic group, determined three months from the date the reminder letter was sent. Participants and those recording the outcomes (receipt of a spoiled or non-spoiled test kit) were blinded to group assignment. Results: 2333 M?ori and 2938 Pacific people participated (11 withdrew). Those who were sent the DVD (1029 M?ori and 1359 Pacific) were less likely to participate in screening than those who were not (1304 M?ori and 1579 Pacific). Screening participation was reduced by 12.3% (95% CI 9.1-15.5%) in M?ori (13.6% versus 25.9%) and 8.3% (95% CI 5.8-10.8%) in Pacific (10.1% versus 18.4%). However, spoiled kit rates (first return) were significantly higher among those not sent the DVD (33.1% versus 12.4% in M?ori and 42.1% versus 21.9% in Pacific). Conclusion: The DVD sent with the reminder letter to BSP non-responders reduced screening participation to an extent that more than offset the lower rate of spoiled kits.

"Awareness of headspace youth mental health service centres across Australian communities between 2008 and 2015",2019,"Background: Two common barriers to help-seeking are lack of awareness of appropriate services, and low mental health literacy. The headspace awareness campaigns are designed to address these factors. Aims: To examine whether distance from a headspace centre affects community awareness of headspace, and whether general awareness of headspace changed between 2008 and 2015. Method: Responses from 4707 participants aged 12–25 years, collected in 2008 and 2015, were analysed. The effect of headspace centre location on awareness of services was assessed by comparing awareness between those living in headspace areas (within 20 km of a centre) and those who were not. Change in awareness between 2008 and 2015 was assessed. Results: Awareness of headspace and its services was significantly greater among those living in headspace areas than among those living further away. Within headspace areas, awareness increased by 27% between 2008 and 2015. Prompted and unprompted awareness were significantly greater in 2015 than in 2008. Conclusions: Awareness of headspace has increased over time; however, innovative awareness campaigns are needed for those residing in non-headspace areas. Continued funding to increase headspace’s national coverage, improving mental health literacy and service access for youth and their families, particularly those living in non-headspace areas, is needed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adolescent; adult; article; awareness; child; female; funding; human; human experiment; juvenile; literacy; major clinical study; male; mental health service; school child"
"Effects of a footwear intervention on foot pain and disability in people with gout: A randomised controlled trial",2019,"Background: There is limited evidence supporting the long-term effect of a foot care package that includes footwear for people with gout. The aim of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of a footwear intervention on foot pain and disability in people with gout over 6 months. Methods: Participants with gout (n = 94) were randomly allocated to either a control group (podiatric care and gout education) or footwear intervention group (podiatric care and gout education plus a commercially available athletic shoe). Measurements were undertaken at baseline and 2, 4, and 6 months. Primary outcome was foot pain severity. Secondary outcomes were overall pain, foot impairment/disability, footwear comfort, fit, ease and weight. Data were analysed using repeated measures models. Results: Baseline foot pain scores were low, and no differences in foot pain scores were observed between groups over 6 months (adjusted effect estimate: - 6.7, 95% CI - 16.4 to 2.9, P = 0.17). Improvements between groups in overall pain scores (adjusted effect estimate: - 13.2, 95% CI - 22.2 to - 4.3, P < 0.01) and foot impairment/disability scores (- 4.7, 95% CI - 9.1 to - 0.3, P = 0.04) favouring the footwear intervention were observed at 2 months, but not at 4 or 6 months. Improvements between groups in footwear fit (adjusted effect estimate: - 11.1, 95% CI - 21.1 to - 1.0, P = 0.03), ease (- 13.2, 95% CI - 23.8 to - 2.7, P = 0.01) and weight (- 10.3, 95% CI - 19.8 to - 0.8, P = 0.03) favouring the footwear intervention were also observed over 6 months. Similar improvements were observed for footwear comfort at 2 and 4 months. No other differences in secondary outcomes measured were observed at 6 months (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Addition of footwear to a foot care package did not improve foot pain in people with gout. Short-term improvements in overall pain and foot impairment/disability and more durable improvements in footwear comfort and fit were observed with the footwear intervention.

"Overview of results from the Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study",2019,"Background: The Vitamin D Assessment (ViDA) study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of monthly vitamin D supplementation in reducing the incidence of a range of acute and chronic diseases and intermediate outcomes. Methods: The study was carried out in Auckland, New Zealand, among 5110 adults, aged 50–84?years, who were followed for a median 3.3?years. The intervention was vitamin D3 (2.5?mg or 100,000?IU) or placebo softgel oral capsules, mailed monthly to participants’ homes, with two capsules sent in the first mail-out post-randomisation (i.e. 200,000?IU bolus, or placebo), followed 1?month later (and thereafter monthly) with 100,000?IU vitamin D3 or placebo capsules. Outcomes were monitored through routinely collected health data and self-completed questionnaires. Results: The results showed no beneficial effect of vitamin D supplementation on incidence of cardiovascular disease, falls, non-vertebral fractures and all cancer. However, beneficial effects from vitamin D supplementation were seen: for persistence with taking statins in participants on long-term statin therapy; and also in bone mineral density and arterial function in participants with low 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, and in lung function among ever smokers (especially if vitamin D deficient). The latter findings are consistent with several previous studies, Conclusion: Monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation does not prevent a range of diseases, but may be beneficial for some intermediate outcomes in people who are vitamin D deficient.

"Foot and ankle characteristics in systemic lupus erythematosus: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Objective: To determine characteristics of the foot and ankle in people with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods: Medline, CINAHL, Sports-Discus, Scopus and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to January 2018. Studies reporting foot- and ankle-related outcomes in the following domains were included: vascular, neurological, musculoskeletal, cutaneous (skin and nail) or pain/function. The Quality Index tool was used to assess methodological quality. Where appropriate, odds ratio (OR) and mean difference meta-analyses were conducted for case-control studies; and pooled mean prevalence meta-analyses for studies assessing characteristics in SLE. Results: Forty-nine studies were included with mean (range) quality scores of 75% (38–100%). Twenty-three studies assessed vascular characteristics, followed by musculoskeletal (n = 16), neurological (n = 11), cutaneous (n = 5) and pain/function (n = 4). Foot and ankle characteristics in people with SLE included impaired vascular supply, abnormal nerve function, musculoskeletal pathology, skin and nail pathology, and pain and functional disability. Twenty-four studies were included in meta-analyses. Pooled OR for abnormal ankle brachial index was 3.08 for SLE compared with controls. Pooled mean difference in brachial-ankle pulse-wave velocity between SLE and controls was significant (161.39 cm/s, P = 0.004). Pooled prevalence was 0.54 for intermittent claudication, 0.50 for Raynaud's phenomenon, 0.28 for chilblains, 0.00 for gangrene, 0.30 for hallux valgus, 0.15 for onychomycosis, 0.76 for history of foot pain, and 0.36 for current foot pain.

"Young people's explanations for youth suicide in New Zealand: a thematic analysis",2019,"New Zealand has one of the highest youth suicide rates in the developed world and dominant approaches to prevention do not always take into account the views of young people. The purpose of this research was to update our understanding of young people's explanations of suicide in order to inform suicide prevention efforts. Focus groups were conducted with 38 young people, including 30 young women and 8 young men aged 15–22. The data was analysed thematically to identify the range of explanations young people ascribe to youth suicide. Five themes were identified by the analysis including that suicide could be explained by inescapable difficulties, constant pressure, emotional distress and could also be seen as a cry for help. In contrast to these normalised experiences, participants also expressed the view that mental illness might also account for suicide. The findings suggest that young people recognise suicide as a complex problem with multiple causes. While they recognised mental health problems as contributing, youth suicide was primarily understood by young people as a normal response to emotional distress and pressure. Prevention programmes should address the full range of explanations that young people give for suicide in order to promote their engagement in prevention programmes. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Indigenous data and health: critical approaches to ‘race’/ethnicity and Indigenous data governance",2019,"‘Race’/ethnicity data have become increasingly institutionalised within research on Indigenous health. While these data are important to monitoring the differential distribution of health risks and benefits in racialised societies, their uncritical and undertheorised use can perpetuate harmful biologically deterministic and essentialist approaches to Indigenous health. In addition, narratives of Indigenous health are often still shaped by colonial logics, with Indigenous data rights, priorities and governance overlooked or ignored. Researchers need to critique the use of ‘race’/ethnicity concepts and data in Indigenous health research. This requires an explicit shift away from describing ‘race’/ethnicity as ‘risk factors’ to examining processes by which ‘race’/ethnicity become meaningful in relation to health outcomes for Indigenous communities. In addition, researchers need to consider how Indigenous rights to health data are recognised, including the application of frameworks or principles of Indigenous data sovereignty. ? 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health","health risk; indigenous population; public health; race; racism; article; ethnicity; health hazard; human; medical research; monitoring; narrative; organization; racism; risk factor; scientist; ancestry group; ethnic group; health status; information processing; medical research; population group; procedures; Biomedical Research; Continental Population Groups; Data Collection; Ethnic Groups; Health Status; Humans; Population Groups"
"Modifiable risk factors for prescription medicine sharing behaviours",2019,"Depending on the circumstances, non-recreational, prescription medicine sharing can have positive or negative consequences. An online survey of adults was conducted to examine the extent and underlying behavioural factors predicting prescription medicine sharing behaviours. Using principal component analysis and multivariate regression analysis, several modifiable risk factors for medicine lending and borrowing behaviours were identified. The findings expand the current knowledge of medicine sharing predictors and can be used to inform the development of interventions to address problems associated with medicine sharing practices. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.Background: Prescription medicine sharing has been defined as giving one's own medicine to someone else (lending) or taking someone else's medicine (borrowing). Medicines can be shared for non-medical purposes (recreational sharing or drug abuse) or for their intended therapeutic benefits (non-recreational sharing, e.g. sharing antibiotics to self-treat); the latter is the focus of this research. Limited research evidence is available about modifiable risk factors for non-recreational medicine sharing and addressing this issue was the main aim of this research. Methods: An online, cross-sectional survey design was used. The study population comprised a convenience sample of 233 adults, who were primarily recruited through patient support groups across New Zealand. Principal component analysis was used to develop scales assessing attitudes toward medicine lending and borrowing. Logistic regression was used to examine the relationship between explanatory (demographics, medical conditions, and attitudes towards medicine sharing) and outcome (medicine sharing behaviours) variables. Results: Half of the study participants reported ever borrowing/lending medicines, and approximately a third of participants reported borrowing/lending in the past year. Modifiable risk factors associated with an increased risk of medicine borrowing behaviour were having more difficulty with accessing medicine (‘access-related issue’), stronger ‘emotional beliefs about borrowing’, and greater ‘concern about missing doses.’ Greater ‘concern for the wellbeing of others’ and stronger ‘beliefs about the benefits and safety of lending’ were associated with an increased risk of medicine lending behaviour. Those with a higher ‘perceived risk of harm’ were less likely to borrow or lend medicines. Conclusions: This research expands the current knowledge of medicine sharing by examining underlying behavioural factors which predict sharing behaviours and that can be modified by interventions. This research suggests using multifaceted interventions which consider health status, behavioural, and psychosocial factors, as these appear to contribute most to medicine sharing. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","prescription drug; adolescent; adult; aged; female; health behavior; human; male; middle aged; New Zealand; principal component analysis; questionnaire; risk factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Prescription Drugs; Principal Component Analysis; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Glycogen synthase kinase 3-β inhibition induces lymphangiogenesis through β-catenin-dependent and mTOR-independent pathways",2019,"Lymphatic vessels play an important role in health and in disease. In this study, we evaluated the effects of GSK3-β inhibition on lung lymphatic endothelial cells in vitro. Pharmacological inhibition and silencing of GSK3-β resulted in increased lymphangiogenesis of lung lymphatic endothelial cells. To investigate mechanisms of GSK3-β-mediated lymphangiogenesis, we interrogated the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway and found that inhibition of GSK3-β resulted in PTEN activation and subsequent decreased activation of AKT, leading to decreased p-P70S6kinase levels, indicating inhibition of the mTOR pathway. In addition, consistent with a negative role of GSK3-β in β-catenin stability through protein phosphorylation, we found that GSK3-β inhibition resulted in an increase in β-catenin levels. Simultaneous silencing of β-catenin and inhibition of GSK3-β demonstrated that β-catenin is required for GSK3-β-induced lymphangiogenesis. ? 2019 Stump et al.

"Role of diet and food intake in age-related macular degeneration: a systematic review",2019,"A systematic literature review was conducted to evaluate the role of diet and food intake in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Eighteen high-quality studies were identified. Adherence to a Mediterranean diet had decreased risk of AMD progression. An Oriental diet pattern had decreased association with AMD prevalence, whereas a Western diet pattern had increased association with AMD prevalence. High consumption of vegetables rich in carotenoids and fatty fish containing omega-3 fatty acids was beneficial for those at risk of AMD. Vegetable oils and animal fats containing omega-6 fatty acids, and red/processed meat should be consumed minimally to reduce the risk of AMD progression. High glycaemic index diets and alcohol consumption of greater than two drinks a day had increased association with AMD. As the quality of diet and food intake had a vital role in AMD, the provision of appropriate nutritional advice to those at risk of AMD is recommended. ? 2018 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists","alpha tocopherol; ascorbic acid; beta carotene; calcium; carbohydrate; carotenoid; multivitamin; omega 3 fatty acid; omega 6 fatty acid; vegetable oil; xanthophyll; zeaxanthin; zinc; age related macular degeneration; alcohol consumption; calcium intake; caloric intake; carbohydrate intake; dairy product; dietary intake; dietary pattern; disease association; disease course; fat intake; fish; food intake; fruit; human; Mediterranean diet; nonhuman; patient compliance; patient education; red meat; Review; risk reduction; systematic review; vegetable; vitamin intake; Western diet; diet; disease exacerbation; eating; macular degeneration; physiology; procedures; Diet; Disease Progression; Eating; Humans; Macular Degeneration"
"Primary care research priorities in low-and middle-income countries",2019,"PURPOSE To identify and prioritize the needs for new research evidence for primary health care (PHC) in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) about organization, models of care, and financing of PHC. METHODS Three-round expert panel consultation of LMIC PHC practitioners and academics sampled from global networks, via web-based surveys. Iterative literature review conducted in parallel. Round 1 (pre–Delphi survey) elicited possible research questions to address knowledge gaps about organization and models of care and about financing. Round 2 invited panelists to rate the importance of each question, and in round 3 panelists provided priority ranking. RESULTS One hundred forty-one practitioners and academics from 50 LMICs from all global regions participated and identified 744 knowledge gaps critical to improving PHC organization and 479 for financing. Four priority areas emerged: effective transition of primary and secondary services, horizontal integration within a multidisciplinary team and intersectoral referral, integration of private and public sectors, and ways to support successfully functioning PHC professionals. Financial evidence priorities were mechanisms to drive investment into PHC, redress inequities, increase service quality, and determine the minimum necessary budget for good PHC. CONCLUSIONS This novel approach toward PHC needs in LMICs, informed by local academics and professionals, created an expansive and prioritized list of critical knowledge gaps in PHC organization and financing. It resulted in research questions, offering valuable guidance to global supporters of primary care evaluation and implementation. Its source and context specificity, informed by LMIC practitioners and academics, should increase the likelihood of local relevance and eventual success in implementing research findings. ? 2019, Annals of Family Medicine, Inc.

"T2 relaxation time measurements in tibiotalar cartilage after barefoot running and its relationship to ankle biomechanics",2019,"The influence of ankle kinematics and plantar pressure from mid-range barefoot running on T2 relaxation times of tibiotalar cartilage is unknown. This study aimed to quantitatively evaluate the T2 relaxation time of tibiotalar cartilage and ankle biomechanics following 5 km barefoot running. Twenty healthy runners (who had no 5 km barefoot running experience) underwent 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance (MR) scans and assessment of running gait before and after 5 km barefoot running. Participants were divided into two groups consisting of marathon-experienced (n = 10) and novice (n = 10) with equal number of males and females in each group. Three musculoskeletal radiologists measured T2 relaxation times in 18 regions of the ankle cartilage: anterior zone, central zone, and posterior zone, or lateral, middle, and medial sections in the sagittal plane. Three-dimensional ankle kinetics, kinematics, and plantar pressure were all also assessed during barefoot running. In the novice group, the T2 relaxation time in the posterior zone of tibial cartilage (p = 0.001) and lateral section in both tibial (p = 0.02) and talar (p = 0.02) cartilage were significantly increased after barefoot running. Ankle kinematics exhibited significant changes in females. Plantar loading was shifted from the medial to lateral aspect after running. This included a significant reduction in the loading under the toes and the 1st, 2nd and 3rd metatarsals, with a significant increase under the 4th and 5th metatarsals and lateral midfoot. The results suggest that plantar pressure may directly lead to local increases in cartilage T2 signal, which was not associated with changes in ankle kinematics. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Gait analysis; Kinematics; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Relaxation time; Ankle biomechanics; Ankle kinematics; Barefoot run; Central zone; Mid-foot; Plantar pressures; Sagittal plane; T2 relaxation; Cartilage; adult; ankle; article; biomechanics; cartilage; clinical article; controlled study; female; gait; human; kinematics; kinetics; male; metatarsal bone; musculoskeletal radiologist; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; quantitative analysis; relaxation time; runner; running; toe"

"Viewing obesogenic advertising in children's neighbourhoods using Google Street View",2019,"The advertising of unhealthy food and beverages forms an important component of obesogenic environments. Such marketing to children is a key health determinant because of its impact on dietary preference and food purchasing behaviour. The location of outdoor advertising is important in exploring obesogenic environments and children's neighbourhoods. The aim of this study is to explore issues involved in the use of Google Street View to examine outdoor food and beverage advertising. The implications for using Google Street View in the context of neighbourhood built environment research and grass-roots advocacy are discussed. The study was conducted within walkable distances from 19 primary and intermediate schools in Auckland, New Zealand, where “walkable” was defined as limited by 800?m road network boundaries, which are equivalent to school buffer boundaries. Google Street View allows for centrality of data collection, coding, and storage. However, challenges exist with the method because 727 (29.4%) of a total of 2,474 outdoor advertisements that were identified were not able to be categorised because images were unclear, not in English, blocked, or at angles where detail cannot be deciphered. Specific to outdoor advertising for food and beverages, the results presented here show that children are exposed to a significantly greater number of unhealthy advertising than other advertising, P=0.001, eta-squared statistic (0.45) indicates a large effect size. Overall, the results show promise for the use of Google Street View in the study of obesogenic environments. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Ultrabilitation: beyond recovery-oriented rehabilitation",2019,"Purpose: Current rehabilitation models emphasize therapy that attempts to return to “normal” the lives of persons who are disabled. An opportunity is available to scrutinize whether this recovery orientation of rehabilitation is necessarily optimal. Method: This conceptual article uses reasoning, informed by experience and a nonsystematic review of literature across diverse disciplines. Results: For some persons with disability, optimizing recovery might be unwanted or insufficient. To expand rehabilitation, we append the Latin “ultra”, beyond, to “habilitare”, make fit. The resulting term, “ultrabilitate”, commits to human flourishing that moves persons toward, around or beyond recovery of particular functioning. Conclusions: By expanding the scope of disability management, ultrabilitation could inform therapy selection and facilitate human flourishing. Empirical research is needed to test our ideas.Implications for rehabilitation Despite significant progress, rehabilitation limits some people with disabilities. Modern health systems still benchmark therapy for rehabilitation against “normal” or species-typical standards to aid recovery. “Ultrabilitation”, meaning “beyond fitness”, promotes flourishing, either without an interest in recovery or in moving toward, beyond or around recovery. Biological, social and technological conditions are needed to support ultrabilitation. Ultrabilitation complements rehabilitation when rehabilitation is not sufficient to optimize functioning and personal growth. ? 2017, ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","convalescence; disabled person; human; philosophy; procedures; psychology; rehabilitation; Disabled Persons; Humans; Philosophy, Medical; Recovery of Function; Rehabilitation"
"The New Zealand government inquiry into mental health and addiction's recommendations on substance use: Some reflections from the science perspective",2019,"The New Zealand Government Inquiry Into Mental Health And Addiction recently tabled its final report, including a substantial set of recommendations. Four of these recommendations focused specifically on interventions and policy for psychoactive substance use (including alcohol and drugs). Based on longstanding involvement in science on alcohol-and other drugs-related health and policy, and similar commission efforts, the authors briefly examine and provide comments on these recommendations from a scientific evidence perspective. In sum, the Inquiry’s recommendations provide a good and sensible basis towards improved substance use-related health and reduced harms in New Zealand. Concrete design and implementation of these reforms require thoughtful consideration of key evidence, details and experiences elsewhere, as well as a concerted strive for policy coherence, in order to be successful. ?

"Are environmental risk factors for current wheeze in the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) phase three due to reverse causation?",2019,"Background: Phase Three of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) measured the global prevalence of symptoms of asthma in children. We undertook comprehensive analyses addressing risk factors for asthma symptoms in combination, at both the individual and the school level, to explore the potential role of reverse causation due to selective avoidance or confounding by indication. Objective: To explore the role of reverse causation in risk factors of asthma symptoms. Methods: We compared two sets of multilevel logistic regression analyses, using (a) individual level exposure data and (b) school level average exposure (ie prevalence), in two different age groups. In individual level analyses, reverse causation is a possible concern if individual level exposure statuses were changed as a result of asthma symptoms or diagnosis. School level analyses may suffer from ecologic confounding, but reverse causation is less of a concern because individual changes in exposure status as a result of asthma symptoms would only have a small effect on overall school exposure levels. Results: There were 131 924 children aged 6-7 years (2428 schools, 25 countries) with complete exposure, outcome and confounder data. The strongest associations in individual level analyses (fully adjusted) were for current paracetamol use (odds ratio = 2.06; 95% confidence interval 1.97-2.16), early life antibiotic use (1.65; 1.58-1.73) and open fire cooking (1.44; 1.26-1.65). In school level analyses, these risk factors again showed increased risks. There were 238 586 adolescents aged 13-14 years (2072 schools, 42 countries) with complete exposure, outcome and confounder data. The strongest associations in individual level analyses (fully adjusted) were for current paracetamol use (1.80; 1.75-1.86), cooking on an open fire (1.32; 1.22-1.43) and maternal tobacco use (1.23; 1.18-1.27). In school level analyses, these risk factors again showed increased risks. Conclusions & clinical relevance: These analyses strengthen the potentially causal interpretation of previously reported individual level findings, by providing evidence against reverse causation. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Exploring the Use of Complementary and Alternative Medicine in Cancer Patients",2019,"In Australia, it is estimated that around 17% to 87% of cancer patients have used one form of complementary therapy during their cancer treatment. There are numerous reasons and contributing factors for cancer patients to consider using complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). CAM information and products are readily available. However, the level of evidence to support the benefits of use in the cancer setting is limited, and the associated adverse effects and interactions with conventional medicine may not be fully studied. Besides, not all health professionals favor the concept of integrative health approaches, or have the confidence in dealing with CAM due to a lack of knowledge and standardization of practices. A thematic review of the literature was performed on the main contributing factors to cancer patients' use of CAM, as well as the current issues that may be encountered by the patients and health professionals.","alternative medicine; Australia; health care personnel; human; neoplasm; procedures; Australia; Complementary Therapies; Health Personnel; Humans; Neoplasms"

"A food environments feedback system (FoodBack) for empowering citizens and change agents to create healthier community food places",2019,"This study developed a systems-based approach (called FoodBack) to empower citizens and change agents to create healthier community food places. Formative evaluations were held with citizens and change agents in six diverse New Zealand communities, supplemented by semi-structured interviews with 85 change agents in Auckland and Hamilton in 2015-2016. The emerging system was additionally reviewed by public health experts from diverse organizations. A food environments feedback system was constructed to crowdsource key indicators of the healthiness of diverse community food places (i.e. schools, hospitals, supermarkets, fast food outlets, sport centers) and outdoor spaces (i.e. around schools), comments/pictures about barriers and facilitators to healthy eating and exemplar stories on improving the healthiness of food environments. All the information collected is centrally processed and translated into 'short' (immediate) and 'long' (after analyses) feedback loops to stimulate actions to create healthier food places. FoodBack, as a comprehensive food environment feedback system (with evidence databases and feedback and recognition processes), has the potential to increase food sovereignty, and generate a sustainable, fine-grained database of food environments for real-time food policy research. ?

"Improving Measurement of Trait Competitiveness: A Rasch Analysis of the Revised Competitiveness Index With Samples From New Zealand and US University Students",2019,"Measuring competitiveness is necessary to fully understand variables affecting student learning. The 14-item Revised Competitiveness Index has become a widely used measure to assess trait competitiveness. The current study reports on a Rasch analysis to investigate the psychometric properties of the Revised Competitiveness Index and to improve its precision for international comparisons. Students were recruited from medical studies at a university in New Zealand, undergraduate health sciences courses at another New Zealand university, and a psychology undergraduate class at a university in the United States. Rasch model estimate parameters were affected by local dependency and item misfit. Best fit to the Rasch model (χ 2 (20) = 15.86, p =.73, person separation index =.95) was obtained for the Enjoyment of Competition subscale after combining locally dependent items into a subtest and discarding the highly misfitting Item 9. The only modifications required to obtain a suitable fit (χ 2 (25) = 25.81, p =.42, person separation index =.77) for the Contentiousness subscale were a subtest to combine two locally dependent items and splitting this subtest by country to deal with differential item functioning. The results support reliability and internal construct validity of the modified Revised Competitiveness Index. Precision of the measure may be enhanced using the ordinal-to-interval conversion algorithms presented here, allowing the use of parametric statistics without breaking fundamental statistical assumptions. ?

"The CSF1 receptor inhibitor pexidartinib (PLX3397) reduces tissue macrophage levels without affecting glucose homeostasis in mice",2020,"Background and objectives: Excessive adipose tissue macrophage accumulation in obesity has been implicated in mediating inflammatory responses that impair glucose homeostasis and promote insulin resistance. Colony-stimulating factor 1 (CSF1) controls macrophage differentiation, and here we sought to determine the effect of a CSF1 receptor inhibitor, PLX3397, on adipose tissue macrophage levels and understand the impact on glucose homeostasis in mice. Methods: A Ten-week-old mice were fed a chow or high-fat diet for 10 weeks and then treated with PLX3397 via oral gavage (50 mg/kg) every second day for 3 weeks, with subsequent monitoring of glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity and assessment of adipose tissue immune cells. Results: PLX3397 treatment substantially reduced macrophage numbers in adipose tissue of both chow and high-fat diet fed mice without affecting total myeloid cell levels. Despite this, PLX3397 did not greatly alter glucose homeostasis, did not affect high-fat diet-induced increases in visceral fat cytokine expression (Il-6 and Tnfa) and had limited effect on the phosphorylation of the stress kinases JNK and ERK and macrophage polarization. Conclusions: Our results indicate that macrophage infiltration of adipose tissue induced by a high-fat diet may not be the trigger for impairments in whole body glucose homeostasis, and that anti-CSF1 therapies are not likely to be useful as treatments for insulin resistance. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","interleukin 6; mitogen activated protein kinase; pexidartinib; stress activated protein kinase; tumor necrosis factor; adipose tissue cell; animal experiment; Article; bone marrow cell; chow diet; elimination half-life; glucose homeostasis; glucose tolerance; glycemic control; immunocompetent cell; infant; insulin sensitivity; intra-abdominal fat; lipid diet; macrophage; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; subcutaneous fat"
"Do data from child protective services and the police enhance modelling of perinatal risk for paediatric abusive head trauma? A retrospective case-control study",2019,"Objectives First, to investigate whether there is a relationship between a family being known to child protective services or police at the time of birth and the risk of abusive head trauma (AHT, formerly known as shaken baby syndrome). Second, to investigate whether data from child protective services or police improve a predictive risk model derived from health records. Design Retrospective case control study of child protective service and police records. Setting Nine maternity hospitals. Participants 142 consecutive cases of AHT admitted to a tertiary children's hospital from 1991 to 2010 and born in one of the nine participating maternity hospitals. 550 controls matched by the date and hospital of birth. Outcome measure Abusive head trauma. Results There is a relationship between families known to child protective services or police and the risk of AHT. Notification to child protective services: univariable OR 7.24 (95% CI 4.70 to 11.14). Involvement with youth justice: univariable OR 8.94 (95% CI 4.71 to 16.95). Police call-out for partner violence: univariable OR 3.85 (95% CI 2.51 to 5.91). Other violence offence: univariable OR 2.73 (95% CI 1.69 to 4.40). Drug offence: univariable OR 2.82 (95% CI 1.63 to 4.89). However, in multi-variable analysis with data from perinatal health records, notification to child protective services was the only one of these variables to remain in the final model (OR 4.84; 95% CI 2.61 to 8.97) and had little effect on overall predictive power. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 89.5% (95% CI 86.6 to 92.5) using variables from health data alone and 90.9% (95% CI 88.0 to 93.7) when notification was added. Conclusions Family involvement with child protective services or police is associated with increased risk of AHT. However, accessing such data at the time of birth would add little predictive power to a risk model derived from routine health information. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

"How does it feel to be a problem? Patients’ experiences of self-management support in New Zealand and Canada",2019,"Background: The impact of long-term conditions is the “healthcare equivalent to climate change.” People with long-term conditions often feel they are a problem, a burden to themselves, their family and friends. Providers struggle to support patients to self-manage. The Practical Reviews in Self-Management Support (PRISMS) taxonomy lists what provider actions might support patient self-management. Objective: To offer providers advice on how to support patient self-management. Design: Semi-structured interviews with 40 patient-participants. Setting and participants: Three case studies of primary health-care organizations in New Zealand and Canada serving diverse populations. Participants were older adults with long-term conditions who needed support to live in the community. Main outcome measures: Qualitative description to classify patient narratives of self-management support according to the PRISMS taxonomy with thematic analysis to explore how support was acceptable and effective. Results: Patients identified a relationship-in-action as the mechanism, the how by which providers supported them to self-manage. When providers acted upon knowledge of patient lives and priorities, these patients were often willing to try activities or medications they had resisted in the past. Effective self-management support saw PRISMS components delivered in patient-specific combinations by individual providers or teams. Discussion and conclusions: Providers who establish relationships with patients can support them to self-manage and improve health outcomes. Delivery of taxonomy components, in the absence of a relationship, is unlikely to be either acceptable or effective. Providers need to be aware that social determinants of health can constrain patients’ options to self-manage. ? 2018 The Authors Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aged; article; Canada; clinical article; clinician; ethnic group; female; human; male; narrative; New Zealand; organization; patient preference; primary health care; self care; semi structured interview; social determinants of health; taxonomy; thematic analysis"

"Baseline characteristics of gay and bisexual men in a HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis demonstration project with equity quotas in Auckland, New Zealand",2019,"Background: In New Zealand, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) should target gay and bisexual men (GBM), and equity is an important principle. Baseline characteristics of GBM offered PrEP in a demonstration project with an enrolment quota of 50% non-Europeans are described. Methods: An open-label, single-arm treatment evaluation study design ('NZPrEP') was used. The settings were four publicly funded sexual health clinics in Auckland in 2017. The study population was 150 GBM recruited from clinics, community sources and social media. Participants self-completed an online questionnaire about PrEP awareness, attitudes and sexual risk behaviour in the last 3 months. Baseline characteristics are described and examined to determine whether these were associated with PrEP initiation status (self-referral vs doctor/nurse recommendation). Results: In total, 150 GBM of whom half (52%) were non-European, including 21.3% Maori, 19.3% Asian and 8.7% Pacific, were enrolled into the study. Two-thirds (65.3%) self-referred for PrEP and one-third (34.7%) were recommended PrEP by the doctor/nurse. Participants reported a high number of male condomless receptive anal intercourse partners (MenAICLR) (median 3, range 0-50), with 10% reporting 10 or more MenAICLR and 45.3% reporting group sex. In the previous year, 65.3% had a sexually transmissible infection (STI) 18% had rectal chlamydia or gonorrhoea at enrolment. Almost half (47.7%) had recently used drugs with sex, including 8.1% who used methamphetamine. Participants recommended PrEP had lower education, lived less centrally and had a higher STI prevalence than PrEP self-referrers, but their risk behaviour was similar. Conclusions: Early PrEP adopters in New Zealand have high HIV risk. Demonstration projects should consider equity mechanisms so that minorities can participate meaningfully. ? 2019 CSIRO.","methamphetamine; adult; Article; Asian; attitude to health; awareness; bisexual male; chlamydiasis; condom use; drug use; educational status; ethnicity; European; gonorrhea; group sex; health care planning; health care utilization; health center; health equity; high risk behavior; homosexual male; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection prevention; male; Maori (people); New Zealand; patient referral; pre-exposure prophylaxis; prevalence; program evaluation; rectum disease; sexual health; sexual intercourse; sexually transmitted disease"
"Transplantation and diabetes (Transdiab): A pilot randomised controlled trial of metformin in impaired glucose tolerance after kidney transplantation",2019,"Background: Post transplantation diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is a common and serious complication after renal transplantation with significant morbidity and mortality. Metformin has proven benefits in the general population and might be advantageous in the prevention and management of PTDM. Methods: Transplantation and Diabetes (Transdiab) is a single-centre, unblinded, pilot randomised controlled trial assessing the feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of metformin after renal transplantation in patients with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Participants had an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the 4-12 weeks post-transplantation; those with IGT were randomised to standard care or standard care and metformin 500 mg twice daily and followed up for 12 months. Results: Seventy eight patients had an OGTT over 24 months, 25 of them had IGT, of those, 19 patients were randomised, giving a feasibility of recruitment of 24.4%. Ten patients were randomised to metformin and 9 patients to standard care. Tolerability and efficacy was similar between the 2 groups with no serious adverse events. There was no difference in secondary outcomes relating to the metabolic profile. Conclusions: The use of metformin post renal transplantation appeared feasible and safe.

"Nanoformulations can significantly affect pesticide degradation and uptake by earthworms and plants",2019,"An increasing number of nanoformulated pesticides (nanopesticides) have been developed in recent years with the aim to improve pesticide efficiencies and reduce their impact on the environment and human health. However, knowledge about their environmental fate and effects is still very limited. This study compares the soil fate and bioaccumulation of four model nanopesticides (chlorpyrifos and tebuconazole loaded on polymeric and lipid nanocarriers) relative to the conventional formulations and pure active ingredients (all added at 0.5 mg kg-1) in microcosms containing earthworms Eisenia fetida and lettuce Lactuca sativa in two soils (LUFA 2.1 and 2.4) over a period of four months. The nanoformulations increased the soil half-life of the pesticides by up to 2 times (e.g. chlorpyrifos with lipid nanocarrier and tebuconazole with polymeric nanocarrier in LUFA 2.1), probably as a direct consequence of the slow release of the pesticide from the nanocarriers. Pesticide bioaccumulation in earthworms was often increased for the nanopesticides probably as a result of their enhanced bioavailability. The nanoformulations were also shown to affect the pesticide bioaccumulation in plants, but trends were inconsistent. Overall, the microcosm results demonstrated that nanoformulations can significantly alter the fate and bioavailability of pesticides. However, generalisations were difficult to make as the impacts depended on the type of nanocarrier, pesticide, soil used and time scale. We believe that our study contributes towards the critical mass of case studies needed to enable a judging of the benefits versus risks of nanopesticides. ? 2019 CSIRO.","bioaccumulation; canola; chlorpyrifos; concentration (composition); earthworm; environmental fate; iron nanoparticle; nanoparticle; pesticide; tebuconazole; Eisenia fetida; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa"
"A unified national cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk generator is required to address equity in the management of CVD risk in clinical practice in New Zealand",2019,"There is a strong body of evidence that supports identifying and managing people according to their risk of a future cardiovascular (CVD) event. Since 2012 the New Zealand public health sector has achieved 90% CVD risk assessment (CVDRA) for each eligible person across New Zealand using a modified version of an overseas risk equation, through incentivising Primary Health Organisation (PHO) performance. In 2018 the New Zealand Ministry of Health endorsed the use of a suite of four new CVDRA equations which were developed using the large NZ Predict cohort (500,000 people). These equations more accurately reflect an individual's CVD risk and incorporate both traditional CVD risk factors, such as smoking and diabetes, but also sociodemographic factors including ethnicity and a deprivation score. The new CVDRA equations are an important tool to address the major inequities in CVD incidence, prevalence and mortality in Aotearoa-New Zealand. However, while the new equations provide more accurate assessment of risk, they are more complicated and therefore more prone to error if not properly validated and systematically implemented. To take advantage of this important opportunity to address equity in heart health we need strategic vision and national leadership. In this paper we make the case that to most safely and cost effectively implement the new equations, the Ministry of Health (MOH) should support a unified national CVD risk generator. A single, electronic, national CVD risk generator would: a) ensure national consistency and quality control-a single set of validated and current equations would be available to both clinicians and patients; b) avoid substantial replication of effort and cost in both developing and validating multiple calculators; c) enable central collection of the encrypted dataset required to develop more accurate risk assessment equations in population subgroups, both now and in the future, as CVD risk evolves; d) provide a platform to facilitate systematic and consistent national CVD risk communication and management; and e) facilitate ease of updating the tool and practice in the future as changes to the algorithm are agreed.","adult; aged; cardiovascular disease; clinical decision support system; health equity; human; middle aged; New Zealand; primary health care; procedures; risk assessment; socioeconomics; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Health Equity; Humans; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Primary Health Care; Risk Assessment; Socioeconomic Factors"
"Kidney Health Australia - Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment guideline recommendations for infection control for haemodialysis units",2019,"Aim: There is no national consensus on infection control in haemodialysis units in Australia and New Zealand. The primary aim of this guideline was to provide recommendations on screening for blood-borne viruses and multi-resistant organisms for dialysis units based on the available evidence. Methods: The Kidney Health Australia Caring for Australasians with Renal Impairment guidelines, overall approach to guideline development follows the GRADE framework. A facilitated workshop was conducted to ensure that patient and caregiver concerns were considered. The evidence from relevant medical databases on the impact of screening on detection and transmission rates, hospitalization, mortality and psychosocial care, was reviewed and critically appraised. The guideline group made recommendations from the evidence available. Results: The main guideline recommendations are: Dialysis units adopt a comprehensive approach that encompasses standard infection control precautions. Conduct routine surveillance for key blood-borne viruses and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Conduct routine surveillance of individual levels of protection against hepatitis B for patients on haemodialysis. Use dedicated dialysis machines for HBV-infected patients. The evidence in totality was not found to support routine surveillance of vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. Enhanced surveillance in light of the local risk of transmittable infectious agents should be considered by dialysis units. Very few studies have reported on the potential adverse effects of screening and associated practices. Conclusions: Future research should focus on the potential benefits and adverse effects of screening and associated practices on clinical outcomes including infections prevented and health service delivery, and psychosocial domains for patients. Given the results of trials in the critical setting, the effectiveness of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus decolonization in people receiving dialysis therapy warrants further research. ? 2018 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology","adverse event; Article; Australia; caregiver; clinical outcome; clinical practice; GRADE approach; health care delivery; hemodialysis; hepatitis B; hospitalization; human; infection control; infection risk; kidney failure; methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus; mortality; New Zealand; nonhuman; patient care; practice guideline; priority journal; psychosocial care; risk benefit analysis; screening; vancomycin resistant Enterococcus; virus transmission; blood; consensus; evidence based medicine; hemodialysis; infection control; isolation and purification; kidney disease; nephrology; practice guideline; risk assessment; risk factor; Staphylococcus infection; virology; virus infection; Australia; Consensus; Evidence-Based Medicine; Hemodialysis Units, Hospital; Humans; Infection Control; Kidney Diseases; Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus; Nephrology; New Zealand; Renal Dialysis; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Staphylococcal Infections; Virus Diseases"
"Efficacy and acceptability of treatment to eradicate nasal Staphylococcus aureus carriage among haemodialysis patients",2019,"Aim: For patients requiring haemodialysis, the risk of Staphylococcus aureus disease is higher in those colonized and persists while the person requires haemodialysis, necessitating frequent decolonization. However, the duration of successful decolonization is not known. This study aimed to determine the duration of efficacy of decolonization in intermittent and persistent S. aureus carriers requiring haemodialysis using two decolonization strategies. Methods: We screened 100 outpatients requiring haemodialysis for S. aureus carriage and then decolonized 14 intermittent carriers and 18 persistent carriers. Participants were invited to undertake two decolonization attempts, using systemic or topical antibiotics 12 weeks apart. Nasal swabs were taken weekly to determine the duration of successful decolonization. Results: Decolonization was successful in 24/32 (75%) participants and the median duration of decolonization was 35 days (95% confidence interval (CI) 11–59). The median duration of S. aureus decolonization was significantly shorter for persistent carriers (19 days, 95% CI 13–25 days) in comparison with intermittent carriers (70 days, 95% CI 61–79 days; P < 0.01). 28/52 (54%) post-decolonization surveys indicated that they would use the treatment again, 14/52 (27%) surveys indicated that they would not use the treatment again, and 10/52 (19%) were undecided. 16/53 (30%) decolonization attempts resulted in an adverse drug reaction. Conclusion: Staphylococcus aureus decolonization using topical or systemic treatments was successful for many haemodialysis patients, and provided a month free of S. aureus colonization. Although decolonization treatment provided a shorter duration of success for persistent carriers in comparison with intermittent carriers, persistent carriers are likely to gain the most from effective decolonization strategies. ? 2018 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology","cefalexin; chlorhexidine; doxycycline; pseudomonic acid; rifampicin; antiinfective agent; adult; aged; Article; bacterial colonization; bacterium carrier; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; dry skin; eradication therapy; female; hemodialysis patient; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nonhuman; nose; nose smear; outpatient; patient compliance; priority journal; pruritus; rash; screening; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus aureus infection; drug effect; hemodialysis; heterozygote; microbiology; nose mucosa; Staphylococcus aureus; time factor; Aged; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Carrier State; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nasal Mucosa; Renal Dialysis; Staphylococcus aureus; Time Factors"
"The Effect of Gastric Electrical Stimulation on Small Bowel Motility in Patients With Gastroparesis and Concomitant Pancreatic and Small Bowel Dysfunction: From Animal Model to Human Application",2019,"Background/Aims: Patients with gastroparesis often have biliary/pancreatic and small bowel symptoms but the effects of gastric electrical stimulation on small bowel electrical activity of the mid-gut have not been studied. Animal model aim: Establish gastric and upper small bowel/biliary slow wave activity relationships with electrical stimulation. Human study aim: Demonstrate improvement in symptoms associated with proximal small bowel dysmotility in gastric stimulated patients. Materials and Methods: Animal model: In vivo evoked responses of duodenal and Sphincter of Oddi measures recorded during gastric electrical stimulation in a nonsurvival swine model (N = 3). High-resolution electrical slow wave mapping of frequency, amplitude, and their ratio, for duodenal and Sphincter of Oddi electrical activity were recorded. Human study: Patients (N = 8) underwent temporary gastric stimulation with small bowel electrodes. Subjective and objective data was collected before and after temporary gastric stimulation. Symptom scores, gastric emptying times, and mucosal electrograms via low-resolution mapping were recorded. Results: Animal gastric stimulation resulted in some changes in electrical activity parameters, especially with the highest energies delivered but the changes were not statistically significant. Human study revealed improvement in symptom and illness severity scores, and changes in small bowel mucosal slow wave activity. Conclusions: Gastric electrical stimulation in an animal model seems to show nonsignificant effects small bowel slow wave activity and myoelectric signaling, suggesting the existence of intrinsic neural connections. Human data shows more significance, with possible potential for therapeutic use of electrical stimulation in patients with gastroparesis and pancreato-biliary and small bowel symptoms of the mid-gut.

"Long-Term Stable Bone Mineral Density in HIV-Infected Men Without Risk Factors for Osteoporosis Treated with Antiretroviral Therapy",2019,"Introduction: Most prospective studies of bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV-infected cohorts taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) have been of short duration, typically < 3?years. Such studies have reported short-term stable or increasing BMD. We assessed whether this BMD stability persists for > 10?years in middle-aged and older men established on ART. Methods: A 12-year, prospective, longitudinal study in 44 HIV-infected men treated with ART who had measurements of BMD at the lumbar spine, proximal femur and total body at baseline, 2, 6 and 12?years. Results: At baseline, the mean age of participants was 49?years, the mean duration of HIV infection was 8?years, and the mean duration of ART was 50?months. After 12?years, BMD increased by 6.9% (95% CI 3.4 to 10.3) at the lumbar spine, and remained stable (range of BMD change: ? 0.6% to 0.0%) at the total hip, femoral neck and total body. Only two individuals had a decrease of > 10% in BMD at any site during follow-up and both decreases in BMD were explained by co-morbid illnesses. Conclusions: BMD remained stable over 12?years in middle-aged and older HIV-infected men treated with ART. Monitoring BMD in men established on ART who do not have risk factors for BMD loss is not necessary. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","antiretrovirus agent; bisphosphonic acid derivative; calcium; colecalciferol; efavirenz plus emtricitabine plus tenofovir disoproxil; glucocorticoid; prednisone; tenofovir disoproxil; vitamin D; zoledronic acid; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; body weight; bone density; chronic obstructive lung disease; cigarette smoking; comorbidity; controlled study; disease course; drug megadose; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; femoral neck; follow up; fracture; fracture risk assessment; hip; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; longitudinal study; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; measurement; middle aged; osteomalacia; osteoporosis; patient monitoring; priority journal; prospective study; proximal femur; randomized controlled trial; risk factor; vitamin D deficiency"

"Clinically Diagnosing Pertussis-associated Cough in Adults and Children: CHEST Guideline and Expert Panel Report",2019,"Background: The decision to treat a suspected case of pertussis with antibiotics is usually based on a clinical diagnosis rather than waiting for laboratory confirmation. The current guideline focuses on making the clinical diagnosis of pertussis-associated cough in adults and children. Methods: The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) methodologic guidelines and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework were used. The Expert Cough Panel based their recommendations on findings from a systematic review that was recently published on the topic; final grading was reached by consensus according to Delphi methodology. The systematic review was carried out to answer the Key Clinical Question: In patients presenting with cough, how can we most accurately diagnose from clinical features alone those who have pertussis-associated cough as opposed to other causes of cough? Results: In adults, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 4 clinical features: paroxysmal cough, post-tussive vomiting, inspiratory whooping, and absence of fever. Both paroxysmal cough and absence of fever had high sensitivity (93.2% [95% CI, 83.2-97.4] and 81.8% [95% CI, 72.2-88.7], respectively) and low specificity (20.6% [95% CI, 14.7-28.1] and 18.8% [95% CI, 8.1-37.9]). Inspiratory whooping and posttussive vomiting had a low sensitivity (32.5% [95% CI, 24.5-41.6] and 29.8% [95% CI, 18.0-45.2]) but high specificity (77.7% [95% CI, 73.1-81.7] and 79.5% [95% CI, 69.4-86.9]). In children, after pre-specified meta-analysis exclusions, pooled estimates of sensitivity and specificity were generated for only 1 clinical feature in children (0-18 years): posttussive vomiting. Posttussive vomiting in children was only moderately sensitive (60.0% [95% CI, 40.3-77.0]) and specific (66.0% [95% CI, 52.5-77.3]). Conclusions: In adults with acute (< 3 weeks) or subacute (3-8 weeks) cough, the presence of whooping or posttussive vomiting should rule in a possible diagnosis of pertussis, whereas the lack of a paroxysmal cough or the presence of fever should rule it out. In children with acute (< 4 weeks) cough, posttussive vomiting is suggestive of pertussis but is much less helpful as a clinical diagnostic test. Guideline suggestions are made based upon these findings and conclusions. ? 2018 American College of Chest Physicians","adult; Article; child; clinical feature; coughing; diagnostic accuracy; evidence based medicine; fever; human; medical expert; paroxysmal cough; pertussis; posttussive vomiting; practice guideline; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; vomiting; complication; consensus; coughing; pertussis; antiinfective agent; Adult; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Child; Consensus; Cough; Humans; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Whooping Cough"
"A narrative review of bariatric surgery in Indigenous peoples",2019,"Introduction: Indigenous peoples suffer high rates of obesity and obesity-related disease worldwide. Currently, bariatric surgery is the most effective intervention for severe obesity and obesity-related disease. The role bariatric surgery plays in alleviating the obesity burden amongst Indigenous peoples is unknown. We aimed to collate studies investigating bariatric surgery in Indigenous peoples and to provide a simple framework to use in future research surrounding this important issue. Materials and methods: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies that investigated outcomes for Indigenous peoples at any point along the bariatric surgery journey were included. Results: Six articles were included in this review. Three studies investigated access to bariatric surgery and the remaining three studies investigated short to long-term outcomes following bariatric surgery. A narrative review was performed given study heterogeneity and quality of included studies. Indigenous peoples had lower access to bariatric surgery and in one study had greater weight loss in comparison to non-Indigenous peoples. Conclusion: Despite a paucity of studies, it appears that there is emerging interest in investigating bariatric surgery among Indigenous peoples. We encourage those who seek to investigate this important issue at any point along the bariatric surgery journey, to do so using an equity-based approach. ? 2018 Asia Oceania Association for the Study of Obesity","bariatric surgery; body weight loss; Cinahl; clinical outcome; comorbidity; human; indigenous people; Medline; obesity; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; remission; Review; systematic review"
"Body size and weight, and the nutrition and activity behaviours of sexual and gender minority youth: Findings and implications from New Zealand",2019,"Objective: To describe the body size and weight, and the nutrition and activity behaviours of sexual and gender minority (SGM) students and compare them with those of exclusively opposite-sex-attracted cisgender students. Male and female SGM students were also compared. Design: Data were from a nationally representative health survey. Setting: Secondary schools in New Zealand, 2012. Participants: A total of 7769 students, 9 % were SGM individuals. Results: Overall, weight-control behaviours, poor nutrition and inactivity were common and, in many cases, more so for SGM students. Specifically, male SGM students (adjusted OR; 95 % CI) were significantly more likely to have tried to lose weight (1·95; 1·47, 2·59), engage in unhealthy weight control (2·17; 1·48, 3·19), consume fast food/takeaways (2·89; 2·01, 4·15) and be physically inactive (2·54; 1·65, 3·92), and were less likely to participate in a school sports team (0·57; 0·44, 0·75), compared with other males. Female SGM students (adjusted OR; 95 % CI) were significantly more likely to engage in unhealthy weight control (1·58; 1·20, 2·08), be overweight or obese (1·24; 1·01, 1·53) and consume fast food/takeaways (2·19; 1·59, 3·03), and were less likely to participate in a school sports team (0·62; 0·50, 0·76), compared with other females. Generally, female SGM students were more negatively affected than comparable males, except they were less likely to consume fast food/takeaways frequently (adjusted OR; 95 % CI: 0·62; 0·40, 0·96). Conclusions: SGM students reported increased weight-control behaviours, poor nutrition and inactivity.

"The effects of walking posture on affective and physiological states during stress",2019,"Background and objectives: Embodiment theory proposes that motor processes are associated with emotions and cognitions. Previous research has shown that walking posture can influence affective memory bias. This study further investigated this theory by looking at the effects of an upright versus slumped walking posture on psychological and physiological states when faced with a psychological stressor. Methods: Seventy-three healthy adults completed baseline self-report measures of affect, power, and sleepiness, and physiological measures of blood pressure, galvanic skin response, and skin temperature. After walking in their usual posture, the same self-report and physiological measures were obtained. Participants were then randomly allocated into one of two groups where they were asked to walk in either an upright posture or a slumped posture. While walking, participants underwent a psychological stressor. After experimental walking, the same self-report and physiological measures were obtained. Results: The upright walking posture group showed significantly improved psychological states including less low arousal negative affect, less sleepiness, less pain and marginally greater feelings of power than the slumped walking posture group. Physiologically, the upright walking posture group showed significantly lower systolic blood pressure, galvanic skin response, and marginally lower skin temperature than the slumped walking posture group. Limitations: This was a short-term laboratory-based experiment and results may not generalise to other situations. Conclusions: Walking posture can affect both psychological and physiological states. Applications of these findings may have implications for improving mental and physiological health. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","adult; affect; Article; body position; controlled study; electrodermal response; female; human; human experiment; male; mental stress; normal human; physiological stress; randomization; self report; skin temperature; slumped posture; somnolence; walking"
"Transcriptomic analysis of circulating neutrophils in metabolically stressed peripartal grazing dairy cows",2019,"The high metabolic demand during the transition into lactation places cows at greater risk of metabolic and infectious disease than at any other time in their lactation cycle. Additionally, a change occurs in the innate immune response during this period, which contributes to increased risk of disease. In the current study, we compared the transcriptomes of neutrophils from dairy cows divergent in their metabolic health post-calving. Cows (n = 5 per risk group) were selected from a parent experiment (n = 45 cows). Those with high or low concentrations of plasma nonesterified fatty acids, plasma β-hydroxybutyrate, and liver triacylglycerol in both wk 1 and 2 were deemed to be at “high risk” (HR) or “low risk” (LR) of metabolic dysfunction, respectively. Circulating neutrophils were isolated at 3 time points during the transition period (d 0 and wk 1 and 4 post-calving), and gene expression was analyzed using RNA sequencing. Differential gene expression between the risk groups was determined using edgeR (http://bioconductor.org), and pathway analysis was conducted using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (Ingenuity Systems, Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Statistical analysis indicated no interaction between risk and week. Therefore, the overall effect of risk was analyzed across all time points. In total, 3,500 genes were differentially expressed between the HR and LR cows (false discovery rate < 0.05). Of these, 2,897 genes were identified by Ingenuity Pathway Analysis and used for pathway analysis. Of the relevant pathways identified, neutrophils isolated from HR cows showed downregulation of genes involved in the recruitment of granulocytes, interferon signaling, and apoptosis, and upregulation of genes involved in cell survival. The results indicate that metabolically stressed cows had reduced neutrophil function during the peripartum period, highlighting a potential relationship between subclinical metabolic disease and innate immune function that suggests that metabolic health negatively affects the innate immune system and may contribute to the state of immunosuppression during the peripartum period. In this way, the metabolic stress among the HR cows may reduce their ability to combat infection during the transition period. ? 2019 American Dairy Science Association","3 hydroxybutyric acid; fatty acid; triacylglycerol; animal; blood; bovine; cattle disease; chemistry; female; gene expression; gene expression profiling; genetics; immunity; immunology; lactation; liver; neutrophil; perinatal period; physiological stress; physiology; risk factor; sequence analysis; upregulation; veterinary medicine; 3-Hydroxybutyric Acid; Animals; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; Female; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Immunity; Lactation; Liver; Neutrophils; Peripartum Period; Risk Factors; Sequence Analysis, RNA; Stress, Physiological; Triglycerides; Up-Regulation"
"Synthesis of Bioactive Side-Chain Analogues of TAN-2483B",2019,"The fungal metabolite TAN-2483B has a 2,6-trans-relationship across the pyran ring of its furo[3,4-b]pyran-5-one core, which has thwarted previous attempts at its synthesis. We have now developed a chiral pool approach to this core and prepared side-chain analogues of TAN-2483B. The synthesis relies on ring expansion of a reactive furan ring-fused dibromocyclopropane and alkynylation of the resulting pyran. The furan ring is constructed by palladium-catalysed carbonylative lactonisation. Various side-chains are appended through Wittig-type chemistry. The prepared analogues showed micromolar activity towards cancer cell lines HL-60, 1A9 and MCF-7 and certain human disease-relevant kinases, including Bruton's tyrosine kinase (Btk). ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Metabolomics applied to maternal and perinatal health: A review of new frontiers with a translation potential",2019,"The prediction or early diagnosis of maternal complications is challenging mostly because the main conditions, such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and gestational diabetes mellitus, are complex syndromes with multiple underlying mechanisms related to their occurrence. Limited advances in maternal and perinatal health in recent decades with respect to preventing these disorders have led to new approaches, and “omics” sciences have emerged as a potential field to be explored. Metabolomics is the study of a set of metabolites in a given sample and can represent the metabolic functioning of a cell, tissue or organism. Metabolomics has some advantages over genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics, as metabolites are the final result of the interactions of genes, RNAs and proteins. Considering the recent “boom” in metabolomic studies and their importance in the research agenda, we here review the topic, explaining the rationale and theory of the metabolomic approach in different areas of maternal and perinatal health research for clinical practitioners. We also demonstrate the main exploratory studies of these maternal complications, commenting on their promising findings. The potential translational application of metabolomic studies, especially for the identification of predictive biomarkers, is supported by the current findings, although they require external validation in larger datasets and with alternative methodologies. ? 2019 CLINICS.","biological marker; female; human; maternal welfare; metabolism; metabolomics; newborn; perinatal care; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prematurity; procedures; prognosis; third trimester pregnancy; translational research; trends; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Maternal Health; Metabolomics; Perinatal Care; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Premature Birth; Prognosis; Translational Medical Research"

"Mucolytic agents versus placebo for chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",2019,"Background Individuals with chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may suffer recurrent exacerbations with an increase in volume or purulence of sputum, or both. Personal and healthcare costs associated with exacerbations indicate that therapies that reduce the occurrence of exacerbations are likely to be useful. Mucolytics are oralmedicines that are believed to increase expectoration of sputum by reducing its viscosity, thus making it easier to cough it up. Improved expectoration of sputum may lead to a reduction in exacerbations of COPD. Objectives Primary objective ? To determine whether treatment with mucolytics reduces exacerbations and/or days of disability in patients with chronic bronchitis or COPD Secondary objectives ? To assess whether mucolytics lead to improvement in lung function or quality of life ? To determine frequency of adverse effects associated with use of mucolytics Search methods We searched the Cochrane Airways Group Specialised Register and reference lists of articles on 12 separate occasions, most recently on 23 April 2019. Selection criteria We included randomised studies that compared oral mucolytic therapy versus placebo for at least two months in adults with chronic bronchitis or COPD. We excluded studies of people with asthma and cystic fibrosis. Data collection and analysis This review analysed summary data only, most derived from published studies. For earlier versions, one review author extracted data, which were rechecked in subsequent updates. In later versions, review authors double-checked extracted data and then entered data into RevMan 5.3 for analysis. Main results We added four studies for the 2019 update. The review now includes 38 trials, recruiting a total of 10,377 participants. Studies lasted between two months and three years and investigated a range of mucolytics, including N-acetylcysteine, carbocysteine, erdosteine, and ambroxol, given at least once daily. Many studies did not clearly describe allocation concealment, and we had concerns about blinding and high levels of attrition in some studies. The primary outcomes were exacerbations and number of days of disability. Results of 28 studies including 6723 participants show that receiving mucolytics may be more likely to be exacerbation-free during the study period compared to those given placebo (Peto odds ratio (OR) 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.56 to 1.91; moderatecertainty evidence). However, more recent studies show less benefit of treatment than was reported in earlier studies in this review. The overall number needed to treat with mucolytics for an average of nine months to keep an additional participant free from exacerbations was eight (NNTB 8, 95% CI 7 to 10). High heterogeneity was noted for this outcome (I2 = 62%), so results need to be interpreted with caution. The type or dose of mucolytic did not seem to alter the effect size, nor did the severity of COPD, including exacerbation history. Longer studies showed smaller effects of mucolytics than were reported in shorter studies. Mucolytic use was associated with a reduction of 0.43 days of disability per participant per month compared with use of placebo (95% CI -0.56 to -0.30; studies = 9; I2 = 61%; moderate-certainty evidence). With mucolytics, the number of people with one or more hospitalisations was reduced, but study results were not consistent (Peto OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89; participants = 1788; studies = 4; I2 = 58%; moderate-certainty evidence). Investigators reported improved quality of life with mucolytics (mean difference (MD) - 1.37, 95% CI -2.85 to 0.11; participants = 2721; studies = 7; I2 = 64%; moderate-certainty evidence). However, the mean difference did not reach the minimal clinically important difference of -4 units, and the confidence interval includes no difference. Mucolytic treatment was associated with a possible reduction in adverse events (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.94; participants = 7264; studies = 24; I2 = 46%; moderate-certainty evidence), but the pooled effect includes no difference if a random-effects model is used. Several studies that could not be included in the meta-analysis reported high numbers of adverse events, up to a mean of five events per person during follow-up. There was no clear difference between mucolytics and placebo for mortality, but the confidence interval is too wide to confirm that treatment has no effect on mortality (Peto OR 0.98, 95% CI 0.51 to 1.87; participants = 3527; studies = 11; I2 = 0%; moderate-certainty evidence). Authors’ conclusions In participants with chronic bronchitis or COPD, we aremoderately confident that treatment withmucolytics leads to a small reduction in the likelihood of having an acute exacerbation, in days of disability per month and possibly hospitalisations, but is not associated with an increase in adverse events. There appears to be limited impact on lung function or health-related quality of life. Results are too imprecise to be certain whether or not there is an effect on mortality. Our confidence in the results is reduced by high levels of heterogeneity in many of the outcomes and the fact that effects on exacerbations shown in early trials were larger than those reported by more recent studies. This may be a result of greater risk of selection or publication bias in earlier trials, thus benefits of treatment may not be as great as was suggested by previous evidence. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.","acetylcysteine; ambroxol; carbocisteine; corticosteroid; erdosteine; mucolytic agent; placebo; expectorant agent; chronic bronchitis; chronic obstructive lung disease; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug safety; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; hospitalization; human; lung function; mortality rate; peak expiratory flow; priority journal; quality of life; Review; treatment outcome; unspecified side effect; chronic bronchitis; chronic obstructive lung disease; disease exacerbation; randomized controlled trial (topic); Bronchitis, Chronic; Disease Progression; Expectorants; Humans; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Quality of Life; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Treatment Outcome"
"Visual and ocular morbidity in severe open-globe injuries presenting to a regional eye centre in New Zealand",2019,"Importance: Open-globe injuries (OGI) are a leading cause of monocular blindness world-wide with considerable cost to the individual and society. Background: To characterize the epidemiology, severity and outcomes of OGI treated at a major ophthalmology centre in New Zealand. Design: Retrospective study. Participants: A total of 385 eyes of 381 patients over a 10-year period. Methods: Eligible patients were identified using diagnosis and surgery codes on hospital discharge summaries. Clinical notes were reviewed to determine patient demographics, injury details, treatments and outcomes. Main Outcome Measures: Complications of injury, visual acuity at 3 months and final follow-up, and final status of the eye. Results: The estimated annual incidence of OGI was 2.8 per 100 000. Working-age males predominated but age at injury ranged from 9 months to 90 years. Maori and Pacific peoples were over-represented. Injuries were severe with 58.7% presenting with vision of hand movements or worse. Penetrating injuries (56.4%) were most common, followed by globe ruptures (35.6%). Major complications included retinal detachment (15.8%), enucleation/evisceration (9.1%), phthisis bulbi (9.9%), endophthalmitis (2.6%) and sympathetic ophthalmia (0.26%). Despite the injury severity, 46% of eyes achieved final BCVA of ?6/12. The Ocular Trauma Score (OTS) was a useful prognostic tool for stratifying severity of injury and predicting visual outcome (Fisher's exact test P < 0.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The incidence and severity of OGI in NZ are comparable to global statistics. Surgical repair can effectively recover vision, predicted well by the OTS. We identified at-risk groups to target with education and prevention strategies. ? 2018 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists","antibiotic agent; adult; age; alpha hemolytic Streptococcus; Article; automutilation; Bacillus; best corrected visual acuity; Candida parapsilosis; coagulase negative Staphylococcus; demography; disease severity; endophthalmitis; Escherichia coli; eye disease assessment; eye enucleation; eye evisceration; eye injury; eye surgery; falling; female; follow up; health care facility; hospital discharge; human; incidence; injury severity; lensectomy; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); medical record review; middle aged; New Zealand; occupational accident; Ocular Trauma Score; outcome assessment; Pacific Islander; penetrating trauma; prediction; prognosis; retina detachment; retrospective study; sclera buckling procedure; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Streptococcus oralis; Streptococcus pneumoniae; sympathetic ophthalmia; treatment outcome; visual acuity; visual impairment; vitrectomy; young adult"
"Reaching cardiovascular prevention guideline targets with a polypill-based approach: A meta-Analysis of randomised clinical trials",2019,"Objective The aim of this study was to determine the effect of polypill-based care on the achievement of 2016 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline targets for blood pressure (BP), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and antiplatelet therapy. Methods We conducted an individual participant data meta-Analysis of three randomised clinical trials that compared a strategy using a polypill containing aspirin, statin and antihypertensive therapy with usual care in patients with a prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) event or who were at high risk of their first event. Overall, the trials included 3140 patients from Australia, England, India, Ireland, the Netherlands and New Zealand (75% male, mean age 62 years and 76% with a prior CVD event). The primary outcome for this study was the proportion of people achieving ESC guideline targets for BP, LDL and antiplatelet therapy. Results Those randomised to polypill-based care were more likely than those receiving usual care to achieve recommended targets for BP (62% vs 58%, risk ratio (RR) 1.08, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.15), LDL (39% vs 34%, RR 1.13, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.25) and all three targets for BP, LDL and adherence to antiplatelet therapy (the latter only applicable to those with a prior CVD event) simultaneously (24% vs 19%, RR 1.27, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.47) at 12 months. There was no difference between groups in antiplatelet adherence (96% vs 96%, RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.01). There was heterogeneity by baseline treatment intensity such that treatment effects increased with the fewer the number of treatments being taken at baseline: for patients taking 3, 2 and 0-1 treatment modalities the RRs for reaching all three guideline goals simultaneously were 1.10 (95% CI 0.94 to 1.30, 22% vs 20%), 1.62 (95% CI 1.09 to 2.42, 27% vs 17%) and 3.07 (95% CI 1.77 to 5.33, 35% vs 11%), respectively. Conclusions Polypill-based therapy significantly improved the achievement of all three ESC targets for BP, LDL and antiplatelet therapy compared with usual care, particularly among those undertreated at baseline. ? ?

"The role of icodextrin in peritoneal dialysis: Protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background: Previous meta-analyses have found several advantages of icodextrin compared with glucose in the application of peritoneal dialysis (PD), such as an improvement of peritoneal ultrafiltration during the long dwell and a reduction in episodes of uncontrolled fluid overload. However, the effect of icodextrin on patient-relevant outcomes remains unclear. This review aims to evaluate the benefits and harms of icodextrin in comparison with conventional glucose PD solution in patients with end-stage kidney disease receiving PD. Methods: Randomized controlled trials of icodextrin comparing with conventional glucose solution in patients with end-stage kidney disease who received PD will be deemed eligible. We will conduct systematic searches in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CENTRAL, Ichushi-Web, Chinese and Japanese databases, and in clinical trials registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform Search Portal (ICTRP), EU Clinical Trials Register, Japan Registries Network (JPRN), China's Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR)). Furthermore, we will check conference proceedings and search references from relevant studies manually. Relevant pharmaceutical companies, authors, and experts will be contacted in an effort to identify further studies. We will not apply any limitations regarding language, publication status, and publication date when searching for eligible studies. The selection of studies, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment will be carried out by two independent reviewers. Data synthesis will be performed using RevMan 5 software with either a fixed effects model or random-effects model, depending on the presence of heterogeneity. For the assessment of statistical heterogeneity, I 2 will be calculated. Sources of clinical heterogeneity will be evaluated through subgroup analyses. If there are ten or more studies included in the meta-analysis, we will investigate the publication bias using funnel plots and Egger's test. The quality of the body of evidence will be assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system. Discussion: We assume that our systematic review will be more comprehensive compared to those published previously due to contacting the relevant pharmaceutical companies and a systematic search of published and unpublished non-English studies from China, Taiwan, and Japan.

"Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines turning the tide on inequity: A retrospective cohort study of New Zealand Children Born 2006-2015",2019,"Background Hospitalization rates for infectious diseases in New Zealand (NZ) children have increased since 1989. The highest burden is among M? ori and Pacific children, and the most socioeconomically deprived. New Zealand introduced pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)7 in June 2008, PCV10 in 2011, and PCV13 in 2014. Methods A retrospective cohort study of NZ children aged <6 years between 2006 and 2015 was performed using administrative databases. Demographics and hospitalizations were linked to evaluate the impact of the PCV vaccination program on cases of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), all-cause pneumonia (ACP), and otitis media (OM), defined by ICD-10-AM codes, and to explore the effect by ethnicity and deprivation. Results Between 2006 and 2015, there were 640 children hospitalized with IPD, 26589 for ACP, and 44545 for OM. IPD hospitalizations declined by 73% between 2005 and 2015 for children <6 years of age, whereas ACP and OM declined by 8% and 25%, respectively. The highest rates for all diseases were among M? ori and Pacific children and those from high deprivation. However, the declines were highest among M? ori and Pacific children and those from socioeconomically deprived areas. IPD hospitalizations declined by 79% and 67% for M? ori and Pacific children, respectively, between 2006 and 2015. ACP declined by 12% in M? ori and 21% in Pacific children. OM declined by 51% in M? ori children. Conclusion In contrast to the increasing trend of hospitalization rates for infectious disease in New Zealand, the use of PCV appears associated with reductions in ethnic and socioeconomic disparities in hospitalization for IPD, ACP, and OM. ?

"Chemical neuroanatomy of the substantia nigra in the ovine brain",2019,"The substantia nigra is an integral component of the basal ganglia circuitry for limbic and motor functions. Dysfunction and degeneration of the basal ganglia are fundamental aspects of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. With the increasing use of sheep to model neurological diseases, it is crucial to understand the anatomy and neurochemistry of these key basal ganglia nuclei in the normal sheep brain and how they compare to the human brain. Therefore, studies of the gross anatomy, cellular morphology, and neurochemical expression patterns within the sheep substantia nigra were performed. We show that the sheep substantia nigra reflects all important aspects of the anatomy and neurochemistry of the human substantia nigra, with only minor inter-species differences evident. Many neurochemicals that are central to the functioning of the SN, and wider basal ganglia circuitry, are present throughout the sheep SN. In a wider context, the results of this study provide evidence that the sheep substantia nigra accurately reflects the anatomy of the human substantia nigra, which validates the use of sheep models of basal ganglia neurological disorders. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","4 aminobutyric acid A receptor alpha1; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor alpha3; 4 aminobutyric acid A receptor beta3; calbindin; enkephalin; glutamate decarboxylase 65; glutamate decarboxylase 67; leucine enkephalin; phosphoprotein DARPP 32; substance P; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; animal tissue; Article; basal ganglion; cell structure; degenerative disease; ewe; female; Huntington chorea; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; male; motor performance; neuroanatomy; neurochemistry; neurologic disease; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; priority journal; ram (sheep); sheep; substantia nigra"
"Identifying cardiovascular risk factors that impact cerebrovascular reactivity: An ASL MRI study",2020,"Background: To maintain cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood vessels dilate and contract in response to blood supply through cerebrovascular reactivity (CR). Purpose: Cardiovascular (CV) disease is associated with increased stroke risk, but which risk factors specifically impact CR is unknown. Study Type: Prospective longitudinal. Subjects: Fifty-three subjects undergoing carotid endarterectomy or stenting. Field Strength/Sequence: 3T, 3D pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (PCASL) ASL, and T1 3D fast spoiled gradient echo (FSPGR). Assessment: We evaluated group differences in CBF changes for multiple cardiovascular risk factors in patients undergoing carotid revascularization surgery. Statistical Tests: PRE (baseline), POST (48-hour postop), and 6MO (6 months postop) whole-brain CBF measurements, as 129 CBF maps from 53 subjects were modeled as within-subject analysis of variance (ANOVA). To identify CV risk factors associated with CBF change, the CBF change from PRE to POST, POST to 6MO, and PRE to 6MO were modeled as multiple linear regression with each CV risk factor as an independent variable. Statistical models were performed controlling for age on a voxel-by-voxel basis using SPM8. Significant clusters were reported if familywise error (FWE)-corrected cluster-level was P &lt; 0.05, while the voxel-level significance threshold was set for P &lt; 0.001. Results: The entire group showed significant (cluster-level P &lt; 0.001) CBF increase from PRE to POST, decrease from POST to 6MO, and no significant difference (all voxels with P &gt; 0.001) from PRE to 6MO. Of multiple CV risk factors evaluated, only elevated systolic blood pressure (SBP, P = 0.001), chronic renal insufficiency (CRI, P = 0.026), and history of prior stroke (CVA, P &lt; 0.001) predicted lower increases in CBF PRE to POST. Over POST to 6MO, obesity predicted lower (P &gt; 0.001) and cholesterol greater CBF decrease (P &gt; 0.001). Data Conclusion: The CV risk factors of higher SBP, CRI, CVA, BMI, and cholesterol may indicate altered CR, and may warrant different stroke risk mitigation and special consideration for CBF change evaluation.

"The prognostic landscape of interactive biological processes presents treatment responses in cancer",2019,"Background: Differential gene expression patterns are commonly used as biomarkers to predict treatment responses among heterogeneous tumors. However, the link between response biomarkers and treatment-targeting biological processes remain poorly understood. Here, we develop a prognosis-guided approach to establish the determinants of treatment response. Methods: The prognoses of biological processes were evaluated by integrating the transcriptomes and clinical outcomes of ~26,000 cases across 39 malignancies. Gene-prognosis scores of 39 malignancies (GEO datasets) were used for examining the prognoses, and TCGA datasets were selected for validation. The Oncomine and GEO datasets were used to establish and validate transcriptional signatures for treatment responses. Findings: The prognostic landscape of biological processes was established across 39 malignancies. Notably, the prognoses of biological processes varied among cancer types, and transcriptional features underlying these prognostic patterns distinguished response to treatment targeting specific biological process. Applying this metric, we found that low tumor proliferation rates predicted favorable prognosis, whereas elevated cellular stress response signatures signified resistance to anti-proliferation treatment. Moreover, while high immune activities were associated with favorable prognosis, enhanced lipid metabolism signatures distinguished immunotherapy resistant patients. Interpretation: These findings between prognosis and treatment response provide further insights into patient stratification for precision treatments, providing opportunities for further experimental and clinical validations.

"Prospective associations of maternal choline status with offspring body composition in the first 5 years of life in two large mother-offspring cohorts: The Southampton Women's Survey cohort and the Growing up in Singapore towards healthy Outcomes cohort",2019,"Background: Choline status has been positively associated with weight and fat mass in animal and human studies. As evidence examining maternal circulating choline concentrations and offspring body composition in human infants/children is lacking, we investigated this in two cohorts. Methods: Maternal choline concentrations were measured in the UK Southampton Women's Survey (SWS; serum, n ? 985, 11 weeks' gestation) and Singapore Growing Up Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO); n ? 955, 26-28 weeks' gestation) mother-offspring cohorts. Offspring anthropometry was measured at birth and up to age 5 years. Body fat mass was determined using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at birth and age 4 years for SWS; and using air-displacement plethysmography at birth and age 5 years for GUSTO. Linear-regression analyses were performed, adjusting for confounders. Results: In SWS, higher maternal choline concentrations were associated with higher neonatal total body fat mass {b ? 0.60 standard deviation [SD]/5 mmol/L maternal choline [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.04-1.16]} and higher subscapular skinfold thickness [b ? 0.55 mm/5 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.12-1.00)] at birth. In GUSTO, higher maternal choline concentrations were associated with higher neonatal body mass index-for-age z-score [b ? 0.31 SD/5 mmol/L (0.10-0.51)] and higher triceps [b ? 0.38 mm/5 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.11-0.65)] and subscapular skinfold thicknesses [b ? 0.26 mm/5 mmol/L (95% CI, 0.01-0.50)] at birth. No consistent trends were observed between maternal choline and offspring gain in body mass index, skinfold thicknesses, abdominal circumference, weight, length/ height and adiposity measures in later infancy and early childhood. Conclusion: Our study provides evidence that maternal circulating choline concentrations during pregnancy are positively associated with offspring BMI, skinfold thicknesses and adiposity at birth, but not with growth and adiposity through infancy and early childhood to the age of 5 years. ?

"The surgical anxiety questionnaire (SAQ): development and validation",2019,"Objective: Preoperative anxiety is often assessed using general anxiety measures; existing specific measures might lack content coverage and/or are not psychometrically validated. This study aimed to develop a new self-report measure of surgery-specific anxiety and test its psychometric properties. Design: The surgical anxiety questionnaire (SAQ) was developed from themes identified in qualitative research and reviewed by an interdisciplinary expert team. It was administered preoperatively to 135 patients (56% female, mean age 51) on the day of surgery alongside additional measures of preoperative anxiety, state anxiety, perceived stress, depression and social desirability. Follow-up assessment was conducted immediately post-surgery and two weeks post-surgery (n = 114) to examine recovery and predictive validity of the scale. Results: Factor analysis revealed a three component structure, including: concerns about health (six items), concerns about recovery (four items) and concerns about procedures (four items). Three additional items of relatively high concern were retained in the total score (17 items). The SAQ displayed good reliability, validity (content, construct and predictive) and adequate overall psychometric properties. Conclusions: Preliminary results suggest that the SAQ is a promising tool for measuring preoperative anxiety and predicting recovery. Recommendations for future research include employing a confirmatory factor analysis and examining test-retest reliability. ? 2019, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adult; ambulatory surgery; anxiety; article; confirmatory factor analysis; controlled study; female; follow up; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; middle aged; predictive validity; preliminary data; qualitative research; questionnaire; self report; social desirability; stress; surgery; test retest reliability; validation process; aged; anxiety; diagnosis; factor analysis; psychology; psychometry; reproducibility; Aged; Anxiety; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Pharmacological interventions for chronic pain in children: an overview of systematic reviews",2019,"We know little about the safety or efficacy of pharmacological medicines for children and adolescents with chronic pain, despite their common use. Our aim was to conduct an overview review of systematic reviews of pharmacological interventions that purport to reduce pain in children with chronic noncancer pain (CNCP) or chronic cancer-related pain (CCRP). We searched the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Medline, EMBASE, and DARE for systematic reviews from inception to March 2018. We conducted reference and citation searches of included reviews. We included children (0-18 years of age) with CNCP or CCRP. We extracted the review characteristics and primary outcomes of ?30% participant-reported pain relief and patient global impression of change. We sifted 704 abstracts and included 23 systematic reviews investigating children with CNCP or CCRP. Seven of those 23 reviews included 6 trials that involved children with CNCP. There were no randomised controlled trials in reviews relating to reducing pain in CCRP. We were unable to combine data in a meta-analysis. Overall, the quality of evidence was very low, and we have very little confidence in the effect estimates. The state of evidence of randomized controlled trials in this field is poor; we have no evidence from randomised controlled trials for pharmacological interventions in children with cancer-related pain, yet cannot deny individual children access to potential pain relief.

"What's your PLAN? A pilot study of a brief intervention to improve patient self-reported understanding of their health condition and medication in an inpatient hospital setting",2019,"Objective Health literacy is poor in many health service users. Although interventions exist, none have been implemented during an inpatient setting. This pilot study investigated the effect of a brief intervention, delivered by hospital pharmacists during an inpatient admission, on patient self-reported understanding of their health condition and medication - one aspect of health literacy. Methods Patients admitted to a tertiary hospital in New Zealand on one or more high-risk medication were included. Patients received a brief intervention discussing four steps (PLAN) to help patients: Prepare for their next health visit, Listen and share concerns, Ask questions and Note what to do next. The primary outcome was patient self-reported understanding of their health condition and medication. Secondary outcomes were number and types of pharmacist interventions, patient satisfaction and pharmacist intervention acceptability. Results Thirty-eight patients received the intervention. Scores improved for how well patients felt they understood their health conditions (increase from 3.65±1.16 to 4.28±0.74, P=0.027), their medication (3.50±1.11 to 4.44±0.77, P=0.001) and how to take their medication (4.12±0.95 to 4.60±0.76, P=0.051). Additional pharmacy interventions were made for 47% of patients. Mean patient satisfaction scores were high (4.64±0.57); however, pharmacist acceptability was only moderately positive with many finding the intervention only somewhat rewarding. Conclusion This pilot study shows that a pharmacist-delivered intervention can have an effect on an aspect of health literacy in an inpatient setting. It suggests the potential for further inpatient interventions, which target health literacy issues. ?

"Child and adult snack food intake in response to manipulated pre-packaged snack item quantity/variety and snack box size: a population-based randomized trial",2019,"Objectives: Snacks contribute to overconsumption of energy-dense foods and thence obesity. Previous studies in this area are limited by self-reported data and small samples. In a large population-based cohort of parent–child dyads, we investigated how modification of pre-packaged snack food, i.e. (a) item quantity and variety, and (b) dishware (boxed container) size affected intake. Methods: Design: Randomized trial nested within the cross-sectional Child Health CheckPoint of the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children, clustered by day of visit. Sample: 1299 11–12 year olds, 1274 parents. Exposure: 2 × 2 manipulation of snack box container size and item quantity/variety: (1) small box, few items, (2) large box, few items, (3) small box, more items, (4) large box, more items. Procedure: Participants received a snack box during a 15 min break within their 3.5 h visit; any snacks remaining were weighed. Outcomes: Consumed quantity (grams) and energy intake (kilojoules). Analyses: Unadjusted linear regression. Results: Children who were offered a greater quantity and variety of snack items consumed considerably more energy and a slightly higher food mass (main effect for energy intake: 349 kJ, 95% CI 282–416, standardized mean difference (effect size) 0.66; main effect for mass: 10 g, 95% CI 3–17, effect size 0.17). In contrast, manipulating box size had little effect on child consumption, and neither box size nor quantity/variety of items consistently affected adults’ consumption. Conclusion: In children, reducing the number and variety of snack food items available may be a more fruitful intervention than focusing on container or dishware size. Effects observed among adults were small, although we could not exclude social desirability bias in adults aware of observation. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","adult; Article; Australian; caloric intake; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; fast food; female; food intake; food quantity; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; obesity; priority journal; school child"
"The mitochondria-targeted metabolic tubular injury in diabetic kidney disease",2019,"Background/Aims: Diabetic kidney disease (DKD) is a leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) worldwide, and the importance of tubular injury has been highlighted in recent years. However, the underlying mechanisms and effective therapeutic targets are still unclear. In this study, we investigated mtDNA, mitochondrial dynamics, function and metabolic pathways to determine if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in the development of tubular injury in DKD patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out among healthy controls (HCs, n = 65), diabetes patients without kidney disease (DCs, n = 48) and DKD patients (n = 60). Serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and kidney biopsy specimens were obtained from participants. Metabolomics was employed to investigate cellular metabolism. Results: DKD patients had decreased mtDNA copy numbers and increased mtDNA damage compared to DCs. Mitochondrial fragmentation was specifically presented in tubules, but not in podocytes of DKD patients. The accumulation of damaged mtDNA and fragmented mitochondria resulted in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, activation of apoptosis and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (ΔΨm) in tubules and PBMCs. Furthermore, glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle was perturbed and increased dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and decreased succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS) respectively in these two metabolic pathways were identified as potential biomarkers for tubular injury in DKD. Conclusion: Our study indicates that mitochondrial damage could be the hallmark of tubular injury in DKD patients, and this would provide a novel and attractive therapeutic target to improve this disease. ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Association of Long-term Child Growth and Developmental Outcomes with Metformin vs Insulin Treatment for Gestational Diabetes",2019,"Importance: Metformin is an emerging option for treating gestational diabetes (GDM). However, because metformin crosses the placenta, patients and clinicians are concerned with its long-term effect on child health. Objective: To estimate the association of treating GDM with metformin vs insulin with child growth and development. Design, Setting, and Participants: Population-based cohort study of New Zealand women treated with metformin or insulin for GDM from 2005 to 2012 and their children. This study linked national health care data to create a cohort of mothers and their children, including data from maternity care, pharmaceutical dispensing, hospitalizations, demographic records, and the B4 School Check (B4SC) preschool health assessment. Women treated pharmacologically with metformin or insulin during pregnancy were included. We excluded pregnancies with evidence of diabetes and deliveries prior to 2013. Liveborn infants were linked to their B4SC results. Data were analyzed between January 2017 and May 2018. Exposures: Pharmacologic treatment for GDM with metformin or insulin, measured using pharmaceutical claims data. Main Outcomes and Measures: Child growth (weight and height) and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) scores for behavioral development. All outcomes were derived from the B4SC screening program. Linear and log-binomial regression with inverse probability of treatment weighting was used to estimate the association of child growth and psychosocial outcomes with metformin vs insulin treatment for GDM. Results: In both treatment groups, the mean (SD) maternal age was 32 (5) years. A large proportion of mothers who were treated with insulin identified as New Zealand European (867 [44.9%]) while 576 mothers who were treated with metformin (28.9%) identified as New Zealand European. Approximately one-third of mothers who were treated with metformin (n = 639) identified as Asian. We identified 3928 pregnancies treated with metformin (n = 1996) or insulin (n = 1932). After adjustment, we observed no meaningful difference in weight for height z scores between children exposed to metformin compared with insulin (mean difference, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.20 to 0.01). Risk of being 85th percentile or greater for weight for height was similar between treatment groups (adjusted risk ratio, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.83-1.02). Mean SDQ scores were not meaningfully different between the treatment groups, Children of metformin-treated mothers were not significantly more likely to have parent-reported SDQ scores of 14 or more (adjusted risk ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.88-1.46) than those of insulin-treated mothers. Conclusions and Relevance: Our study compares long-term outcomes among school-aged children following maternal use of metformin vs insulin treatment for GDM. Children of metformin-treated mothers were indistinguishable on growth and developmental assessments from those of insulin-treated mothers. These results will help inform future GDM treatment guidelines.. ? 2018 American Medical Association.

"Psoriasis and infection. A clinical practice narrative",2019,"The Australasian Psoriasis Collaboration has developed a clinical practice narrative with respect to the relationship between psoriasis, its treatment and infection. The cutaneous microbiome of patients with psoriasis is different to those without psoriasis, although the significance of this is unclear. Whilst a wide range of microorganisms has been associated with psoriasis (including β-haemolytic streptococci, Staphylococcus aureus, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Candida albicans, Chlamydia psittaci, human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus), there is limited evidence that antimicrobial therapy is of direct benefit in preventing flares of psoriasis. Psoriasis is independently associated with an increased risk of serious infection, but the absolute risk is low. The risk of serious infections is further increased with immune-modulatory treatments. The decision whether to, and when to, stop or resume immune-modulatory treatment after a serious infection has occurred depends on risk assessment for that patient, taking into account the infection being treated, the risk of recurrent infection, any interventions that can modify the risk and the need for psoriasis control. Live vaccines (e.g. MMR, varicella, zoster and yellow fever) are generally contraindicated in patients with psoriasis on immune-modulatory agents, but this depends on the degree of immune suppression and individual risk factors. Wound healing in psoriasis is normal. Treatment with infliximab, adalimumab, etanercept, methotrexate and ciclosporin can safely be continued through low-risk surgical procedures. For moderate- and high-risk surgeries, a case-by-case approach should be taken based on the patient's individual risk factors and comorbidities. ? 2018 The Australasian College of Dermatologists","adalimumab; antivirus agent; biological product; chickenpox vaccine; cyclosporine; entecavir; etanercept; etretin; golimumab; immunomodulating agent; infliximab; interleukin 12 inhibitor; interleukin 23 inhibitor; isoniazid; isoniazid plus rifampicin; ixekizumab; lamivudine; measles mumps rubella vaccine; methotrexate; secukinumab; tenofovir; tumor necrosis factor antibody; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; unclassified drug; ustekinumab; varicella zoster vaccine; yellow fever vaccine; biological product; immunosuppressive agent; abdominal infection; antimicrobial therapy; beta hemolytic Streptococcus; Candida albicans; candidiasis; Chlamydia psittaci; chronic hepatitis B; cryptococcosis; disease association; drug contraindication; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; Helicobacter pylori; Hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; herpes zoster; histoplasmosis; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection; infection prevention; infection risk; kidney infection; latent tuberculosis; liver toxicity; lymphoma; Malassezia furfur; Malassezia globosa; Malassezia sympodialis; meningitis; Pneumocystis pneumonia; pneumonia; Porphyromonas gingivalis; Proteus; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; psoriasis; respiratory tract infection; Review; risk assessment; sepsis; skin infection; soft tissue infection; Staphylococcus aureus; surgical infection; sustained virologic response; T cell leukemia; tuberculosis; urinary tract infection; vaccination; virus reactivation; wound dehiscence; wound healing; etiology; immunocompromised patient; microbiology; microflora; psoriasis; skin; virology; Biological Products; Humans; Immunocompromised Host; Immunosuppressive Agents; Infections; Microbiota; Psoriasis; Skin"

"Effect of the introduction of C-MAC videolaryngoscopy on first-pass intubation success rates for emergency medicine registrars",2020,"Objectives: The present study investigated the impact of introducing C-MAC videolaryngoscopy as the standard method of visualising glottic structures on first-pass intubation success of emergency medicine (EM) registrars in a large tertiary academic hospital in New Zealand. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, all patients receiving attempted orotracheal intubation in Auckland City Hospital ED 1 year prior to and 1 year after the introduction of C-MAC videolaryngoscopy were compared. The primary outcome was first-pass intubation success rates by EM registrars. Secondary outcomes were first-pass success rates by all intubators, and incidence of any complication of intubation. Results: There were 163 intubations by EM registrars from June 2015 to August 2017. There was a clinically important and statistically significant improvement in first-pass success from 59.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 44.1–68.8%) to 85.1% (95% CI 76.0–91.2%, P < 0.001) after the introduction of C-MAC. In multivariate analysis, the independent predictors of success were: Airway Not Predicted Difficult, odds ratio (OR) 2.49 (95% CI 1.06–5.85, P = 0.037); and use of videolaryngoscope, OR 4.49 (95% CI 1.85–10.91, P = 0.001). Overall, complications of intubation improved significantly after introduction of C-MAC (28.9%, 95% CI 19.9–40.0% prior to C-MAC introduction; 16.1%, 95% CI 9.7–25.3% after; P = 0.048). Conclusion: This is the first published study specifically addressing EM registrar intubation success rates in New Zealand, adding to the existing body of data suggesting that videolaryngoscopy may improve success rates for novice intubators. ? 2019 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine","adult; Article; bradycardia; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; controlled study; emergency medicine; endotracheal intubation; female; first pass intubation success rate; glottis; heart arrest; human; hypotension; laryngoscopy; larynx spasm; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; outcome assessment; oxygen desaturation; patient safety; priority journal; rescue personnel; respiratory tract injury; retrospective study; standardization; tertiary care center; tooth injury; treatment outcome"
"Recombinant Omp2b antigen-based ELISA is an efficient tool for specific serodiagnosis of animal brucellosis",2019,"Control of brucellosis as a worldwide zoonotic disease is based on vaccination of animals and diagnosis of infected cases to be eradicated. Accurate and rapid detection of infected animals is of critical importance for preventing the spread of disease. Current detection of brucellosis is based on whole-cell antigens and investigating serum antibodies against Brucella lipopolysaccharide (LPS). The critical disadvantage is misdiagnosis of vaccinated animals as infected ones and also cross-reactions with other Gram-negative bacteria. Recombinant outer membrane protein 2b (Omp2b) of Brucella abortus was evaluated as a novel serodiagnostic target in comparison to conventional tests which are based on LPS. Recombinant Omp2b (rOmp2b) was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by Ni2+-based chromatography. rOmp2b was evaluated in an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) system for diagnosis of brucellosis, with sera from Brucella-infected mice along with negative sera and sera from mice which were inoculated with other Gram-negative species for assurance of specificity. Thereafter, cattle sera collected from different regions were assessed along with known negative and known positive serum samples. We found that Omp2b can discriminate between Brucella-infected animals and non-infected ones. Results for assessment of two hundred and fifty cattle sera by Omp2b-based indirect ELISA which were compared to Rose Bengal plate agglutination test (RBPT) and serum tube agglutination test (SAT) showed that our proposed procedure has the sensitivity of 88.5%, specificity of 100%, and accuracy of 90.8%. We suggest that recombinant Omp2b could be used as a protein antigen for diagnosis of brucellosis in domestic animals and can be evaluated for detection of human brucellosis. ? 2019, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.","bacterial antigen; bacterial protein; Omp2b protein, Brucella; porin; animal; Bagg albino mouse; bovine; Brucella abortus; brucellosis; cattle disease; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; genetics; human; immunology; isolation and purification; microbiology; mouse; procedures; serology; veterinary medicine; Animals; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Brucella abortus; Brucellosis; Cattle; Cattle Diseases; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Porins; Serologic Tests"

"How do neonatal units within the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network manage ex-preterm infants with severe chronic lung disease still requiring major respiratory support at term?",2019,"Aim: The aim was to survey the Australian and New Zealand Neonatal Network (ANZNN) member units regarding current services and management guidelines for the ex-premature infant with severe chronic lung disease (CLD) still requiring significant respiratory support at term. Methods: A 16-question survey was sent to clinical directors of all Level 3 units in Australia and New Zealand via the network. Reminder emails were sent, as required, to prompt a satisfactory response rate. Results: Survey responses were received from 26 of the 29 (90%) ANZNN Level 3 units. At 37 weeks' corrected gestation, over 90% of the units provide ongoing respiratory support in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). However, by 50 weeks, ongoing care is provided in several settings, including NICU, high dependency unit (HDU)/paediatric intensive care unit or respiratory wards. The majority (76%) of units arrange transfer on an ad hoc basis, but six units (24%) have set criteria for transfer based on gestation, workload and respiratory requirement. Three units declared a maximum age in NICU (44, 46 or 48 weeks). A variety of approaches were used to identify infants who were likely to require transfer, and 78% of units had a staff member assigned to assist transition. Three units stated that they had a home ventilation programme suitable for these infants. No unit supplied a guideline on tracheostomy or specific respiratory management post-term. Conclusion: Despite a significant number of babies requiring ongoing support for severe CLD, the location of the service appears very variable, and there is a lack of specific written guidelines. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","Article; assisted ventilation; Australia; chronic lung disease; controlled study; disease severity; health service; health survey; human; infant; neonatal intensive care unit; New Zealand; practice guideline; pregnancy; prematurity; priority journal; tracheostomy"
"The effects of poi on physical and cognitive function in healthy older adults",2019,"This study investigated the effects of poi (a weight on the end of a cord which is swung in circular patterns around the body) compared with Tai Chi on physical and cognitive function in healthy older adults. A total of 79 participants (60-86 years) were randomly allocated to the poi or Tai Chi group. Physical and cognitive function was measured 1 month before, immediately before, immediately after, and 1 month after the intervention (two lessons a week, for 4 weeks). Immediately postintervention, both groups improved postural stability, upper limb strength, and simple attention. Tai Chi also improved systolic blood pressure. One-month postintervention, compared with immediately postintervention, both groups improved upper limb strength, upper limb range of motion, and memory. Poi also improved systolic blood pressure. Therefore, poi seems to be as effective as Tai Chi for improving physical and cognitive function in healthy older adults. ? 2019 Human Kinetics, Inc.","adult; aged; article; attention; body weight; controlled study; exercise; female; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; memory; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; range of motion; systolic blood pressure; Tai Chi; upper limb"
"Lonely ageing in a foreign land: Social isolation and loneliness among older Asian migrants in New Zealand",2019,"Ageing does not reduce people's need to connect with family members, friends, and acquaintances, and neither does migration. For those older migrants living in a foreign land, connectedness with others plays a particularly important role in achieving a sense of belonging and sustaining their health and well-being. This paper explores the issues of social isolation and loneliness among older Asian migrants in New Zealand. Data were collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews with Chinese- or Korean-speaking migrants aged between 75 and 84?years (n?=?10: all females), and from three focus groups consisting of Chinese- and Korean-speaking migrants (n?=?10: 7 females, 3 males) and Chinese professionals (n?=?5: 3 females, 2 males) between June 2016 and December 2016. The qualitative data obtained were analysed applying a thematic analysis approach using NVivo software for group analysis by a multidisciplinary research team. The findings from the study show that older Asian migrants experienced high levels of isolation and loneliness at least at some points in their migrant lives. Most participants in this study were living alone or with only their spouse, and this living arrangement was likely to provide fertile ground for isolation and loneliness to grow in the context of later-life migration. It was also observed that their lonely ageing ironically resulted from their efforts to preserve family relationships through avoiding being a burden, while allowing them a sort of space to maintain now barely connected lives. The participants revealed multiple ways of coping with lonely and isolated experiences in their limited social network, and these individual strategies allow us to make suggestions about how best to reduce older migrants’ social isolation and loneliness in the New Zealand context and beyond. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aged; aging; article; clinical article; female; human; interdisciplinary research; loneliness; male; migrant; New Zealand; semi structured interview; social isolation; social network; software; speech; spouse; thematic analysis"

"Functional urate-associated genetic variants influence expression of lincRNAs LINC01229 and MAFTRR",2019,"Genetic variation in the genomic regulatory landscape likely plays a crucial role in the pathology of disease. Non-coding variants associated with disease can influence the expression of long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs), which in turn function in the control of protein-coding gene expression. Here, we investigate the function of two independent serum urate-associated signals (SUA1 and SUA2) in close proximity to lincRNAs and an enhancer that reside ?60 kb and ?300 kb upstream of MAF, respectively. Variants within SUA1 are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) for LINC01229 and MAFTRR, both co-expressed with MAF. We have also identified that variants within SUA1 are trans-eQTL for genes that are active in kidney- and serum urate-relevant pathways. Serum urate-associated variants rs4077450 and rs4077451 within SUA2 lie within an enhancer that recruits the transcription factor HNF4α and forms long range interactions with LINC01229 and MAFTRR. The urate-raising alleles of rs4077450 and rs4077451 increase enhancer activity and associate with increased expression of LINC01229. We show that the SUA2 enhancer region drives expression in the zebrafish pronephros, recapitulating endogenous MAF expression. Depletion of MAFTRR and LINC01229 in HEK293 cells in turn lead to increased MAF expression. Collectively, our results are consistent with serum urate variants mediating long-range transcriptional regulation of the lincRNAs LINC01229 and MAFTRR and urate relevant genes (e.g., SLC5A8 and EHHADH) in trans. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"The Participatory Zeitgeist: An explanatory theoretical model of change in an era of coproduction and codesign in healthcare improvement",2019,"Healthcare systems redesign and service improvement approaches are adopting participatory tools, techniques and mindsets. Participatory methods increasingly used in healthcare improvement coalesce around the concept of coproduction, and related practices of cocreation, codesign and coinnovation. These participatory methods have become the new Zeitgeist-the spirit of our times in quality improvement. The rationale for this new spirit of participation relates to voice and engagement (those with lived experience should be engaged in processes of development, redesign and improvements), empowerment (engagement in codesign and coproduction has positive individual and societal benefits) and advancement (quality of life and other health outcomes and experiences of services for everyone involved should improve as a result). This paper introduces Mental Health Experience Co-design (MH ECO), a peer designed and led adapted form of Experience-based Co-design (EBCD) developed in Australia. MH ECO is said to facilitate empowerment, foster trust, develop autonomy, self-determination and choice for people living with mental illnesses and their carers, including staff at mental health services. Little information exists about the underlying mechanisms of change; the entities, processes and structures that underpin MH ECO and similar EBCD studies. To address this, we identified eight possible mechanisms from an assessment of the activities and outcomes of MH ECO and a review of existing published evaluations. The eight mechanisms, recognition, dialogue, cooperation, accountability, mobilisation, enactment, creativity and attainment, are discussed within an explanatory theoretical model of change' that details these and ideal relational transitions that might be observed or not with MH ECO or other EBCD studies. We critically appraise the sociocultural and political movement in coproduction and draw on interdisciplinary theories from the humanities-narrative theory, dialogical ethics, cooperative and empowerment theory. The model advances theoretical thinking in coproduction beyond motivations and towards identifying underlying processes and entities that might impact on process and outcome.

"Impact of radiotherapy on cardiovascular health of women with breast cancer",2019,"Introduction: This study aims to examine the impact of radiotherapy on the cardiovascular health of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the Waikato region in New Zealand. Methods: Women diagnosed with stage 0–III breast cancer and recorded in the Waikato Breast Cancer Registry were divided into two groups: a radiotherapy group and a no-radiotherapy group. Baseline characteristics and treatments were compared in the two groups. Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was performed to compare cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Cox Proportional Hazard regression analysis was used to estimate the hazard ratio of radiotherapy on the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality while adjusting for other factors. Results: A total of 3528 women were included in this study, with 2303 in the radiotherapy group and 1225 in the no-radiotherapy group. At 10-year follow-up, 11.7% of women in the radiotherapy group and 19.4% in the no-radiotherapy group experienced cardiovascular events. Only 2.3% of patients who received radiotherapy died of cardiovascular disease by 10?years compared to 7.0% in the no-radiotherapy group. After adjusting for clinically significant factors, there was unexplained reduced risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the radiotherapy group compared to the no-radiotherapy group (HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59–0.92). No significant difference was found in cardiovascular mortality between the two groups. Conclusions: Radiotherapy appears less likely to be offered to patients at higher risk of cardiovascular disease. No evidence of increased risk of a cardiovascular event was found in the group of women with breast cancer treated with radiotherapy and current regimens appear safe. Traditional cardiovascular risk factors remain the main culprits in this setting. Clinicians should work with patients in managing these risk factors for optimal results. ? 2018 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists","adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer survival; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; middle aged; morbidity; mortality rate; New Zealand; observational study; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; risk reduction; survival rate; treatment outcome; women's health; breast tumor; cardiovascular disease; Kaplan Meier method; pathology; register; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; New Zealand; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors"

"Elevation of postmortem cerebrospinal fluid sodium and chloride levels is a potential adjunct test in the diagnosis of salt water drowning",2019,"Postmortem vitreous humor biochemistry is a useful test in the diagnosis of salt water drowning (SWD). A significant limitation of vitreous humor is the potential effect of prolonged immersion. A recent animal study and case report suggested that cerebrospinal fluid biochemistry may be an alternative to vitreous because it is more resistant to the effects of immersion, given its protected anatomical location. This study compared postmortem cerebrospinal fluid sodium and chloride (PMCSC) levels collected via ventricular aspiration (PMCSC_V) and via lumbar puncture (PMCSC_L) in 13 SWD and 31 nonimmersion deaths. It showed a significant elevation in PMCSC levels in SWD deaths for both PMCSC_V and PMCSC_L (P < 0.05). The areas under the curve on the receiver operating characteristic curves for PMCSC_V and PMCSC_L were 0.73 and 0.83, respectively. The optimal cutoff for PMCSC_V was 216 mmol/L (sensitivity, 0.60; specificity, 0.72; likelihood ratio, 1.80; positive predictive value, 0.45) and for PMCSC_L was 241 mmol/L (sensitivity, 0.78; specificity, 0.73; likelihood ratio, 2.89; positive predictive value, 0.46). This study supports PMCSC levels as another biochemical test that can potentially aid in the diagnosis of SWD, particularly in cases where vitreous humor samples are unavailable or uninterpretable. ?

"The human vestibulo-ocular reflex and saccades: Normal subjects and the effect of age",2019,"Here we characterize in 80 normal subjects (16-84 yr (means ± SD, 47 ± 19 yr) the vestibulo-ocular reflex (VOR) and saccades in response to three-dimensional head impulses with a monocular video head impulse test (vHIT) of the right eye. Impulses toward the right lateral, right anterior, and left posterior canals (means: 0.98, 0.91, 0.79) had slightly higher mean gains compared with their counterparts (0.95, 0.86, 0.76). In the older age group (>60 yr), gains of the left posterior canal dropped 0.09 and left anterior canals rose 0.09 resulting in symmetry. All canal gains reduced with increasing head velocity (0.02- 0.13 per 100°/s). Comparison of lateral canal gains calculated using five published algorithms yielded lower values (~0.80) when a narrow detection window was used. Low-amplitude refixation saccades (amplitude: 1.11 ± 0.98°, peak velocity: 63.9 ± 34.0°/s at 262.0 ± 93.9 ms) were observed among all age groups (frequency: 40.2 ± 23.4%), increasing in amplitude, peak velocity, and frequency in older subjects. Impulses toward anterior canals showed the least frequent saccades and lateral and posterior canals were similar, but lateral canal impulses showed the smallest saccades and the posterior canal showed the largest saccades. Saccade peak-velocity approximate amplitude “main sequence” slope was steeper for the horizontal canals compared with the vertical planes (60 vs. <40°/s per 1°). In summary, we found small but significant asymmetries in monocular vHIT gain that changed with age. Healthy subjects commonly have minuscule refixation saccades that are moderately to strongly correlated with vHIT gain. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Gaze fixation is normally stabilized during rapid “head-impulse” movements by the bisynaptic vestibuloocular reflex (VOR), but earlier studies of normal subjects also report small amplitude saccades. We found that with increased age of the subject the vertical VOR became more variable, while in all semicircular canal directions the saccade frequency, amplitude, and peak velocity increased. We also found that the VOR gain algorithm significantly influences values. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","adolescent; adult; aged; article; controlled study; female; gaze; groups by age; head impulse test; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; saccadic eye movement; semicircular canal; velocity; vestibuloocular reflex; videorecording"

However, there has been less focus on subtyping gamblers with (past or current) or without a history of problem gambling, or on providing more specific treatment or self-help recommendations. The current study sought to subtype current-, past-, and non-problem gamblers using three common comorbidities; psychological distress, risky alcohol use, and impulsivity. Participants’ endorsement of helpful behaviour change strategies was also examined by subtype membership. A total of 385 participants were recruited who had a current gambling problem (n = 128; 33%), a past gambling problem (n = 131, 34%) or never had a gambling problem (n = 126, 33%). Hierarchical cluster analysis identified distinct subtypes of current (i.e., low comorbidity, high psychological distress, risky alcohol use and high comorbidity), past (i.e., low comorbidity, high psychological distress and high comorbidity) and non-problem gamblers (i.e., low comorbidity, high psychological distress, risky alcohol use and moderate impulsivity). The most helpful change strategies for current and past gamblers were similar across subtypes (i.e., accept that gambling needs to change, remind yourself of the negative consequences). Non-problem gamblers reported the most helpful strategy as setting financial limits. This study indicated that treatment of psychological distress, risky alcohol use or impulsivity may be important for all gamblers regardless of their level of risk. ?

"Hepatitis C virus infection status and associated factors among a multi-site sample of people who used illicit drugs in the Amazon region",2019,"Background: Elevated rates of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection have been reported in epidemiological studies with people who used illicit drugs (PWUIDs) in different Brazilian regions. In Brazil's Amazon region, studies have already identified the common use of illicit drugs among adolescents and the high prevalence of HCV infections among PWUIDs. However, all studies done with PWUIDs were conducted with small samples and within limited geographic coverage. This study determined the prevalence and risk factors for HCV infection in PWUIDs in the Amazon region, northern Brazil, as well as estimating the prevalence and factors associated with the HCV spontaneous clearance (HSC). Methods: This cross-sectional study accessed 1666 PWUIDs from multiple municipalities of the Amazon region. Socio-demographic, economic, drug use and health-related information were collected through interviews. Blood samples collected were tested for the presence of anti-HCV antibodies and RNA-HCV. HCV genotypes were identified by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Logistic regressions were run to identify factors independently associated with HCV infection status and HSC. Results: In total, 577 (34.6%) featured HCV antibodies, of which 384 (23.1%) had active HCV infection and 193 (11.6%) indicated HSC. Genotypes 1 (80.2%) and 3 (18.8%) were detected. HCV infection status was associated with the length of illicit drug use history, factors related to parenteral and sexual transmission, and factors of socio-economic marginalization leading to potential risk activities for HCV. HSC was associated with the ethnic (including indigenous) background of participants. Conclusions: High levels of HCV infection were detected in PWUIDs. Genotype 1 was predominant. Intense use of illicit drugs, unprotected sexual intercourse, high number of sexual partners and social marginalization were associated with all HCV infection. HSC was associated with origin (Amazonian-born) and non-white (e.g., Black or Indigenous) of PWUIDs. These findings emphasize the need for improve HCV prevention and control services and care for PWUIDs in the Brazilian Amazon region. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cannabis; cocaine; hepatitis C antibody; illicit drug; virus RNA; hepatitis C antibody; street drug; adult; Amazonas (Brazil); Article; Black person; blood sampling; concurrent sexual partnership; cross-sectional study; demography; disease association; drug use; ethnicity; female; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 3; high risk behavior; human; indigenous people; infection risk; interview; major clinical study; male; medical information; parenteral drug administration; prevalence; real time polymerase chain reaction; sexual transmission; social exclusion; socioeconomics; viral clearance; virus transmission; adolescent; blood; Brazil; drug dependence; genetics; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; pathogenicity; risk factor; virology; Adolescent; Adult; Brazil; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Hepatitis C Antibodies; Humans; Male; Prevalence; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Risk Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Street Drugs; Substance-Related Disorders"
"Glycemic control in Chinese steamed bread: Strategies and opportunities",2019,"Background: Chinese steamed bread (CSB) is a staple food eaten by Chinese population. CSB is commonly made from refined wheat flour and has a high glycemic index (GI). The demand for low and moderate GI CSB has kept increasing. This demand is largely driven by the increased occurrences of various chronic diseases such as diabetes and obesity in China. Scope and approach: This review firstly summarizes the studies on the GI of CSB. Then strategies such as using diverse functional ingredients to produce CSB with reduced GI are presented. Related mechanisms of action responsible for the GI reduction are discussed. How the added ingredients may affect the eating quality of the CSB is also summarized. Differences in CSB and Western baked breads in relation to GI reduction are discussed. Finally, research opportunities on how to produce low/moderate GI CSB with good eating properties are suggested. Key findings and conclusions: Many functional food ingredients from different sources have been used to reduce the GI of CSB. Suitable processing conditions also have the potential to reduce the GI. Functional ingredients have been used to improve other related nutritional properties such as antioxidant activity and inhibition on formation of advanced glycation products. While achieving the nutritional benefits of reducing GI, textural and sensory quality of the CSB should be maintained or improved. A comprehensive approach should be used to design CSB with targeted glycemic property without compromising the eating quality. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Antioxidants; Diseases; Food products; Medical problems; Anti-oxidant activities; Chronic disease; Glycemic index; Mantou; Polyphenols; Starch digestibilities; Steamed bun; Nutrition"
"The INFORMAS healthy food environment policy index (Food-EPI) in Mexico: An assessment of implementation gaps and priority recommendations",2019,"Mexico is one of the countries with the highest prevalence of obesity and recently declared a national epidemic of diabetes. Healthy food environments have the potential to improve the diet of the population and decrease the burden of disease. The aim of the study was to assess the efforts of the Mexican Government towards creating healthier food environments using the Healthy Food Environment Policy Index (Food-EPI). The tool was developed by the International Network for Food and Obesity/Non-communicable Diseases Research, Monitoring and Action Support (INFORMAS). Then, it was adapted to the Latin-American context and assessed the components of policy and infrastructure support. Actors from academia, civil society, government, and food industry assessed the level of implementation of food policies compared with international best practices. Actors were classified as (1) independents from academia and civil society (n?=?36), (2) government (n?=?28), and (3) industry (n?=?6). The indicators with the highest percentage of implementation were those related to monitoring and intelligence. Those related to food retail were rated lowest. When stratified by type of actor, the government officials rated several indicators at a higher percentage of implementation compared with independent actors. None of the indicators were rated at high implementation. Government officials and independent actors agreed upon nine priority actions to improve the food environment in Mexico. These actions have the potential to improve government commitment and advocacy efforts to create healthier food environments. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation","Article; benchmarking; food industry; food quality; government employee; health care policy; health program; healthy diet; human; Mexico; non communicable disease; obesity; questionnaire; validation process"
"Plasma cyclic glycine proline/IGF-1 ratio predicts clinical outcome and recovery in stroke patients",2019,"Objective: Many stroke patients make a partial recovery in function during the first 3?months, partially through promoting insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) function. A prognostic biomarker that associates with IGF-1 function may predict clinical outcome and recovery of stroke. This study evaluated plasma concentrations of IGF-1, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-3 and cyclic-glycine-proline (cGP) and their associations with clinical outcome in stroke patients. Methods: Thirty-four patients were recruited within 3?days of stroke. Clinical assessments included the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) within 3?days (baseline), and at days 7 and 90; the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) and Fugl-Meyer Upper-Limb Assessment Scale (FM-UL) at days 7 and 90. Plasma samples were collected from the patients at the baseline, days 7 and 90. Fifty age-matched control participants with no history of stroke were also recruited and provided plasma samples. IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and cGP concentrations were analyzed using ELISA or HPLC-MS. Results: Baseline concentrations of IGFBP-3, cGP, and cGP/IGF-1 ratio were lower in stroke patients than the control group. The neurological scores of stroke patients were improved and plasma cGP and cGP/IGF-1 ratio increased over time. Baseline cGP/IGF-1 ratio was correlated with the NIHSS scores at day 90 and the changes in NIHSS scores from the baseline to 90?days. Interpretation: Low cGP concentrations and cGP/IGF-1 ratio in stroke patients suggest an impaired IGF-1 function. The cGP/IGF-1 ratio at admission maybe further developed as a prognostic biomarker for stroke recovery. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Bourdieu, networks, and movements: Using the concepts of habitus, field and capital to understand a network analysis of gender differences in undergraduate physics",2019,"Current trends suggest that significant gender disparities exist within Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education at university, with female students being underrepresented in physics, but more equally represented in life sciences (e.g., biology, medicine). To understand these trends, it is important to consider the context in which students make decisions about which university courses to enrol in. The current study seeks to investigate gender differences in STEM through a unique approach that combines network analysis of student enrollment data with an interpretive lens based on the sociological theory of Pierre Bourdieu. We generate a network of courses taken by around 9000 undergraduate physics students (from 2009 to 2014) to quantify Bourdieu's concept of field. We identify the fields in which physics students participate by constructing a weighted co-enrollment network and finding communities within it. We then use odds ratios to report gender differences in transverse movements between different academic fields, and non-parametric tests to assess gender differences in vertical movements (changes in students' achievement rankings within a field). Odds ratios comparing the likelihood of progression from one field to another indicate that female students were more likely to make transverse movements into life science fields. We also found that university physics did a poor job in attracting high achieving students, and especially high achieving female students. Of the students who did choose to study physics at university, low and middle achieving female high school students were more likely to decrease their relative rank in their first year compared to their male counterparts. Low achieving female students were also less likely to continue with physics after their first year compared to their male counterparts. Results and implications are discussed in the context of Bourdieu's theory, and previous research. We argue that in order to remove constraints on female students' study choices, the field of physics needs to provide a culture in which all students feel like they belong. ? 2019 Turnbull et al.

"Early-Stage Translational Research in Perinatal Medicine",2019,"Background: Pre-clinical research, which encompasses studies in animals and in the laboratory, has made significant contributions to the improvement of neonatal outcomes. Methods: Here, we describe examples of how pre-clinical research can be the starting point on the journey to the development of new interventions to improve neonatal care and outcomes and discuss recent progress in ensuring methodological and ethical rigour in pre-clinical research involving animal models. Results: Studies in pregnant sheep led to the serendipitous discovery that preterm lambs born after exogenous corticosteroid exposure were able to aerate their lungs. Subsequent clinical trials confirmed that antenatal corticosteroids given to women at risk of preterm delivery substantially reduce mortality and morbidity in babies born preterm. Animal research also contributed to discoveries in the mechanism of brain injury after hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy, leading to the use of therapeutic hypothermia as an effective treatment. However, animals are sentient creatures and there are significant ethical concerns with their use in studies to benefit human health. Mandated institutional animal research ethics committees ensure adherence to ethical requirements. To provide high-quality data which can be translated into clinical research, pre-clinical research needs to follow rigorous standards of study design and reporting. The ARRIVE guidelines provide guidance for pre-clinical research similar to that provided in the CONSORT guidelines for clinical trials and are gaining acceptance among researchers and journal editors. Conclusion: Improved scientific rigour in the use of animal research will increase the likelihood that pre-clinical research will continue to translate into improved neonatal outcomes. ? 2018 S.

"STRIDER NZAus: a multicentre randomised controlled trial of sildenafil therapy in early-onset fetal growth restriction",2019,"Objective: To assess the effect of maternal sildenafil therapy on fetal growth in pregnancies with early-onset fetal growth restriction. Design: A randomised placebo-controlled trial. Setting: Thirteen maternal–fetal medicine units across New Zealand and Australia. Population: Women with singleton pregnancies affected by fetal growth restriction at 22+0 to 29+6 weeks. Methods: Women were randomised to oral administration of 25 mg sildenafil citrate or visually matching placebo three times daily until 32+0 weeks, birth or fetal death (whichever occurred first). Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcome was the proportion of pregnancies with an increase in fetal growth velocity. Secondary outcomes included live birth, survival to hospital discharge free of major neonatal morbidity and pre-eclampsia. Results: Sildenafil did not affect the proportion of pregnancies with an increase in fetal growth velocity; 32/61 (52.5%) sildenafil-treated, 39/57 (68.4%) placebo-treated [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.49, 95% CI 0.23–1.05] and had no effect on abdominal circumference Z-scores (P = 0.61). Sildenafil use was associated with a lower mean uterine artery pulsatility index after 48 hours of treatment (1.56 versus 1.81; P = 0.02). The live birth rate was 56/63 (88.9%) for sildenafil-treated and 47/59 (79.7%) for placebo-treated (adjusted OR 2.50, 95% CI 0.80–7.79); survival to hospital discharge free of major neonatal morbidity was 42/63 (66.7%) for sildenafil-treated and 33/59 (55.9%) for placebo-treated (adjusted OR 1.93, 95% CI 0.84–4.45); and new-onset pre-eclampsia was 9/51 (17.7%) for sildenafil-treated and 14/55 (25.5%) for placebo-treated (OR 0.67, 95% CI 0.26–1.75). Conclusions: Maternal sildenafil use had no effect on fetal growth velocity. Prospectively planned meta-analyses will determine whether sildenafil exerts other effects on maternal and fetal/neonatal wellbeing.

"Transcriptional changes in prostate of men on active surveillance after a 12-mo glucoraphanin-rich broccoli intervention-results from the Effect of Sulforaphane on prostate CAncer PrEvention (ESCAPE) randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Epidemiological evidence suggests that consumption of cruciferous vegetables is associated with reduced risk of prostate cancer progression, largely attributed to the biological activity of glucosinolate degradation products, such as sulforaphane derived from glucoraphanin. Because there are few therapeutic interventions for men on active surveillance for prostate cancer to reduce the risk of cancer progression, dietary approaches are an appealing option for patients. Objective: We evaluated whether consumption of a glucoraphaninrich broccoli soup for 1 y leads to changes in gene expression in prostate tissue of men with localized prostate cancer. Methods: Forty-nine men on active surveillance completed a 3-arm parallel randomized double-blinded intervention study for 12 mo and underwent transperineal template biopsy procedures and dietary assessment at the start and end of the study. Patients received a weekly 300 mL portion of soup made from a standard broccoli (control) or from 1 of 2 experimental broccoli genotypes with enhanced concentrations of glucoraphanin, delivering 3 and 7 times that of the control, respectively. Gene expression in tissues from each patient obtained before and after the dietary intervention was quantified by RNA sequencing followed by gene set enrichment analyses. Results: In the control arm, there were several hundred changes in gene expression in nonneoplastic tissue during the 12 mo. These were associated with an increase in expression of potentially oncogenic pathways including inflammation processes and epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Changes in gene expression and associated oncogenic pathways were attenuated in men on the glucoraphaninrich broccoli soup in a dose-dependent manner. Although the study was not powered to assess clinical progression, an inverse association between consumption of cruciferous vegetables and cancer progression was observed. Conclusion: Consuming glucoraphanin-rich broccoli soup affected gene expression in the prostate of men on active surveillance, consistent with a reduction in the risk of cancer progression.

"TAS-120 Cancer Target Binding: Defining Reactivity and Revealing the First Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 1 (FGFR1) Irreversible Structure",2019,"1-[(3S)-3-[4-Amino-3-[2-(3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)ethynyl]-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-1-yl]-1-pyrrolidinyl]-2-propen-1-one (TAS-120) is an irreversible inhibitor of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family, and is currently under phase I/II clinical trials in patients with confirmed advanced metastatic solid tumours harbouring FGFR aberrations. This inhibitor specifically targets the P-loop of the FGFR tyrosine kinase domain, forming a covalent adduct with a cysteine side chain of the protein. Our mass spectrometry experiments characterise an exceptionally fast chemical reaction in forming the covalent complex. The structural basis of this reactivity is revealed by a sequence of three X-ray crystal structures: a free ligand structure, a reversible FGFR1 structure, and the first reported irreversible FGFR1 adduct structure. We hypothesise that the most significant reactivity feature of TAS-120 is its inherent ability to undertake conformational sampling of the FGFR P-loop. In designing novel covalent FGFR inhibitors, such a phenomenon presents an attractive strategy requiring appropriate positioning of an acrylamide group similarly to that of TAS-120. ? 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"The role of connexin and pannexin channels in perinatal brain injury and inflammation",2019,"Perinatal brain injury remains a major cause of death and life-long disability. Perinatal brain injury is typically associated with hypoxia-ischemia and/or infection/inflammation. Both hypoxia-ischemia and infection trigger an inflammatory response in the brain. The inflammatory response can contribute to brain cell loss and chronic neuroinflammation leading to neurological impairments. It is now well-established that brain injury evolves over time, and shows a striking spread from injured to previously uninjured regions of the brain. There is increasing evidence that this spread is related to opening of connexin hemichannels and pannexin channels, both of which are large conductance membrane channels found in almost all cell types in the brain. Blocking connexin hemichannels within the first 3 h after hypoxia-ischemia has been shown to improve outcomes in term equivalent fetal sheep but it is important to also understand the downstream pathways linking membrane channel opening with the development of injury in order to identify new therapeutic targets. Open membrane channels release adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and other neuroactive molecules, into the extracellular space. ATP has an important physiological role, but has also been reported to act as a damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) signal mediated through specific purinergic receptors and so act as a primary signal 1 in the innate immune system inflammasome pathway. More crucially, extracellular ATP is a key inflammasome signal 2 activator, with purinergic receptor binding triggering the assembly of the multi-protein inflammasome complex. The inflammasome pathway and complex formation contribute to activation of inflammatory caspases, and the release of inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-1β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-18, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). We propose that the NOD-like receptor protein-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which has been linked to inflammatory responses in models of ischemic stroke and various inflammatory diseases, may be one mechanism by which connexin hemichannel opening especially mediates perinatal brain injury.

"Patient access to medicines in two countries with similar health systems and differing medicines policies: Implications from a comprehensive literature review",2019,"Background: Countries with similar health systems but different medicines policies might result in substantial medicines usage differences and resultant outcomes. The literature is sparse in this area. Objective: To review pharmaceutical policy research in New Zealand and Australia and discuss differences between the two countries and the impact these differences may have on subsequent medicine access. Methods: A review of the literature (2008–2016) was performed to identify relevant, peer-reviewed articles. Systematic searches were conducted across the six databases MEDLINE, PubMed, Science Direct, Springer Links, Scopus and Google Scholar. A further search of journals of high relevance was also conducted. Using content analysis, a narrative synthesis of pharmaceutical policy research influencing access to medicines in Australia and New Zealand was conducted. The results were critically assessed in the context of policy material available via grey literature from the respective countries. Results: Key elements regarding pharmaceutical policy were identified from the 35 research papers identified for this review. Through a content analysis, three broad categories of pharmaceutical policy were found, which potentially could influence patient access to medicines in each country; the national health system, pricing and reimbursement. Within these three categories, 9 subcategories were identified: national health policy, pharmacy system, marketing authorization and regulation, prescription to non-prescription medicine switch, orphan drug policies, generic medicine substitution, national pharmaceutical schedule and health technology assessment, patient co-payment and managed entry agreements. Conclusions: This review systematically evaluated the current literature and identified key areas of difference in policy between Australia and NZ. Australia appears to cover and reimburse a greater number of medicines, while New Zealand achieves much lower prices for medicines than their Australian counterparts and has been more successful in controlling national pharmaceutical expenditure. Delays in patient access to new therapies in New Zealand have considerable implications for overall patient access to medicines; however, higher patient co-payments and relative pharmaceutical expenditure in Australia and its effect upon patient access to medicines must also be considered. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","drug; Australia; drug control; drug cost; health care delivery; human; New Zealand; public health; reimbursement; Australia; Drug and Narcotic Control; Drug Costs; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Insurance, Health, Reimbursement; National Health Programs; New Zealand; Pharmaceutical Preparations"
"Mouse models for human hyperuricaemia: a critical review",2019,"Hyperuricaemia (increased serum urate concentration) occurs mainly in higher primates, including in humans, because of inactivation of the gene encoding uricase during primate evolution. Individuals with hyperuricaemia might develop gout — a painful inflammatory arthritis caused by monosodium urate crystal deposition in articular structures. Hyperuricaemia is also associated with common chronic diseases, including hypertension, chronic kidney disease, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Many mouse models have been developed to investigate the causal mechanisms for hyperuricaemia. These models are highly diverse and can be divided into two broad categories: mice with genetic modifications (genetically induced models) and mice exposed to certain environmental factors (environmentally induced models; for example, pharmaceutical or dietary induction). This Review provides an overview of the mouse models of hyperuricaemia and the relevance of these models to human hyperuricaemia, with an emphasis on those models generated through genetic modifications. The challenges in developing and comparing mouse models of hyperuricaemia and future research directions are also outlined. ? 2019, Springer Nature Limited.","breast cancer resistance protein; glucose transporter; SLC2A9 protein; unclassified drug; urate; urate oxidase; disease model; environmental factor; enzyme inhibition; experimental animal; gene expression; gene knockout; gene mutation; genetic background; genetically engineered mouse strain; gout; human; hyperuricemia; mortality; mouse model; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; survival; uric acid blood level"
"Consumer and carer leadership in palliative care academia and practice: A systematic review with narrative synthesis",2019,"Background: Contemporary health policies call for consumers to be part of all aspects of service planning, implementation, delivery and evaluation. The extent to which consumers are part of the systemic decision-making levels of palliative care appears to vary between and within services and organisations. Aim: The aim of this systematic review is to develop understandings about consumer and carer leadership in palliative care. Design: A systematic, narrative synthesis approach was adopted due to the heterogeneity of included studies. The review was registered on PROSPERO prospectively (PROSPERO 2018 CRD42018111625). Data sources: PubMed, Scopus and PsycINFO were searched for all studies published in English specifically focusing on consumers’ leadership in palliative care organisations and systems. Articles were appraised for quality using a modified JBI-QARI tool. Results: Eleven studies met the inclusion criteria and quality assessment. Consumers are currently involved in leadership of palliative care teaching, research and services. Findings highlight the benefits of consumer leadership in palliative care including more relevant, higher-quality services, teaching and research. Across the included studies, it was not clear the extent to which consumer leaders had influence in relation to setting agendas across the palliative care sector. Conclusion: The findings suggest that more could be done to support consumer leadership within palliative care. Academics and clinicians might improve the relevance of their work if they are able to more meaningfully partner with consumers in systemic roles in palliative care. ?

"Review article: A primer for clinical researchers in the emergency department: Part VII. Considering a research higher degree in emergency medicine: How does it work, where to start, what to consider",2019,"In this series we address important topics for clinicians who participate in research or are considering research as part of their career path in emergency medicine. While much emergency research is successfully done by clinicians without a research higher degree (RHD), undertaking a master's degree or doctorate allows a research topic to be pursued in greater depth. It also provides a solid basis for a future research career in terms of research quality, advanced skills, academic progression and track record, as well as eligibility for grants and RHD supervision. The decision to undertake a RHD is not an easy one, and requires consideration of the time and cost involved, as well as the impact on a clinician's life plans. However, the expertise provided through a RHD often ultimately complements clinical training and establishes an excellent foundation for future research and career. This article provides an overview of RHDs and what to consider before embarking on one. ? 2018 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine","article; career; clinician; emergency medicine; emergency ward; human; scientist; skill; Australia; decision making; education; educational status; emergency medicine; New Zealand; personnel; questionnaire; research; statistics and numerical data; trends; Australia; Career Choice; Educational Status; Emergency Medicine; Humans; New Zealand; Research; Research Personnel; Surveys and Questionnaires"

METHODS: We analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Birth Cohort Linked Birth/Infant Death Data Set (2007–2011: 20 685 463 births and 19 127 SUIDs). SUID was defined as deaths at,1 year of age with International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision codes R95 (sudden infant death syndrome), R99 (ill-defined or unknown cause), or W75 (accidental suffocation or strangulation in bed). RESULTS: SUID risk more than doubled (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.44; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.31–2.57) with any maternal smoking during pregnancy and increased twofold between no smoking and smoking 1 cigarette daily throughout pregnancy. For 1 to 20 cigarettes per day, the probability of SUID increased linearly, with each additional cigarette smoked per day increasing the odds by 0.07 from 1 to 20 cigarettes; beyond 20 cigarettes, the relationship plateaued. Mothers who quit or reduced their smoking decreased their odds compared with those who continued smoking (reduced: aOR = 0.88, 95% CI 0.79–0.98; quit: aOR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.67–0.87). If we assume causality, 22% of SUIDs in the United States can be directly attributed to maternal smoking during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: These data support the need for smoking cessation before pregnancy. If no women smoked in pregnancy, SUID rates in the United States could be reduced substantially.

"Testing and Analysis of Migration Displacement of a Flared Stent Deployed in an Esophageal Swallowing Robot.",2019,"Dysphagia is one of the common suffering condition occurs in esophageal cancer (EC) patients. Implanting self-expanding metal stents in the esophagus is one of the most effective ways for the palliation of the malignant dysphagia. The stents are associated with a common problem known as stent migration (SM) in the esophagus which occurs due to the axial force applied by the peristaltic contractions. A softbodied esophageal swallowing robot (ESR) has been developed to mimic the human swallowing process. Peristalsis in the ESR was achieved by modelling the biological peristaltic wave contractions. This paper discuss a new methodology to test and analyse a newly designed flared stent and its migration on the esophageal swallowing robot. Stent migration tests were performed on the esophageal swallowing robot to determine the displacement of the stent from its initial position due to the effect of the travelling of the peristaltic contractile waves. It was observed that migration displacement increases with the number of peristalsis cycle until it reaches a saturation point where no further displacement occurs. It was also noted that by increasing the applied input pressure in the esophageal swallowing robot, the stent migration displacement becomes higher. The work discussed here also promises that a tool like esophageal swallowing robot can provide a passage for a better stent design which can illuminate the path of prevention of stent migration. ? 2018 IEEE.","Diseases; Machine design; Physiology; Robots; Stents; dysphagia; Esophageal cancer; Migration tests; peristalsis; Peristaltic waves; Saturation point; Stent design; stent migration; Computer vision"
"Renal outcomes following left renal vein harvest for venous reconstruction during pancreas and liver surgery",2019,"Background: The left renal vein (LRV) may be used for venous reconstruction during hepato-pancreato-biliary (HPB) surgery, although concerns exist about compromising renal function. This study aimed to determine renal outcomes following LRV harvest during HPB resections. Methods: Circumferential PV/SMV resections from 2008 to 2014 were included within two groups (LRV harvest, Control). Absolute and change in Creatinine (Cr) and estimated GFR (eGFR), and rates of acute kidney injury (AKI) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), were compared. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed. Results: 76 patients were included (LRV n = 17, Control n = 59). Median Cr and eGFR did not change within groups, although change in eGFR differed between groups at postoperative day (POD) 3 (?4.3 vs. 12.8, p = 0.0035) and 7 (?1.8 vs. 12.4, p = 0.0074). AKI occurred more frequently in the LRV group at POD1 (5/17 vs. 4/59, p = 0.023) and POD3 (5/17 vs. 3/59, p = 0012), with no difference in CKD between groups (2/11 vs. 5/33 at 3 months, p = 0.99). LRV harvest was an independent risk factor for AKI at POD1 and POD3, but not thereafter. Conclusions: Patients who undergo LRV harvest experience a higher rate of AKI in the first three post-operative days. LRV harvest during pancreas resection does not impact on long-term renal function. ? 2018 International Hepato-Pancreato-Biliary Association Inc.","inotropic agent; acute kidney failure; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; creatinine blood level; distal pancreatectomy; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; intensive care unit; kidney injury; kidney vein; length of stay; liver surgery; major clinical study; male; operation duration; operative blood loss; pancreas surgery; pancreaticoduodenectomy; reoperation; retrospective study; risk factor; treatment outcome; vein anastomosis; vein reconstruction; vein thrombosis"
"Understandings of disease among Pacific peoples with diabetes and end-stage renal disease in New Zealand",2019,"Background: Compared with New Zealand Europeans, Pacific peoples in New Zealand develop type 2 diabetes at a higher rate and a younger age, and have 3.8 times higher incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Objective: To investigate contextual factors that shape understandings of disease for Pacific peoples with diabetes and ESRD. Methods: Focussed ethnography. In-depth interviews were conducted with 16 Pacific people on haemodialysis for diabetic ESRD, in Auckland, New Zealand. Study participants aged between 30 and 69?years old were of Samoan, Cook Islander, Tongan, Niuean or Tokelauan ethnicity. Thematic analysis was used to code and identify themes. Results: Participants were embedded in a multigenerational legacy of diabetes. The limited diabetes-related education of earlier generations influenced how future generations behaved and understood diabetes. Perceptions were compounded by additional factors including the invisibility of early-stage diabetes; misunderstandings of health risks during communication with health providers; and misunderstandings of multiple conditions’ symptoms and management. Participants had limited engagement with health services until their diagnosis of ESRD acted as a trigger to change this behaviour. However, this trigger was not effective in itself—rather, it was in combination with relevant education delivered in a way that made sense to participants, given their current understandings. Conclusions: Illness representations drive choices and behaviours with respect to self-management of diabetes and engagement with health services. Diabetes is often present in multiple generations of Pacific people; therefore, illness representations are developed and shared within a family. Changing illness representations requires engagement with the individual within a family context. ? 2019 The Authors Health Expectations published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"Consensus Paper: Experimental Neurostimulation of the Cerebellum",2019,"The cerebellum is best known for its role in controlling motor behaviors. However, recent work supports the view that it also influences non-motor behaviors. The contribution of the cerebellum towards different brain functions is underscored by its involvement in a diverse and increasing number of neurological and neuropsychiatric conditions including ataxia, dystonia, essential tremor, Parkinson’s disease (PD), epilepsy, stroke, multiple sclerosis, autism spectrum disorders, dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and schizophrenia. Although there are no cures for these conditions, cerebellar stimulation is quickly gaining attention for symptomatic alleviation, as cerebellar circuitry has arisen as a promising target for invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation. This consensus paper brings together experts from the fields of neurophysiology, neurology, and neurosurgery to discuss recent efforts in using the cerebellum as a therapeutic intervention. We report on the most advanced techniques for manipulating cerebellar circuits in humans and animal models and define key hurdles and questions for moving forward. ? 2019, The Author(s).","Article; ataxia; brain depth stimulation; cerebellum; cerebrovascular accident; clinical effectiveness; consensus development; dystonia; epilepsy; essential tremor; functional connectivity; human; motor learning; nerve stimulation; neuromodulation; neurophysiology; neurosurgery; nonhuman; optogenetics; parkinsonism; priority journal; transcranial electrical stimulation"
"Lifetime risk of primary total knee replacement surgery in New Zealand from 2000 to 2015",2019,"AIM: To estimate the lifetime risk of total knee replacement surgery (TKR) including unicompartmental knee replacement surgery (UKR) for osteoarthritis (OA) in New Zealand, and to identify if lifetime risk is changing over time. METHOD: Data on primary TKR procedures performed for OA from 2000 to 2015 in New Zealand was obtained from the New Zealand joint registry. Life tables and population data were sourced from Statistics New Zealand and the Ministry of Health of New Zealand. Lifetime risk of TKR was calculated for each year from 2000 to 2015 using registry population data and life tables. RESULTS: The overall lifetime risk of TKR in New Zealand increased markedly from 2000 to 2015, with females having an overall greater lifetime risk increasing from 9.4% in 2000 to 16.8% in 2015, a relative increase of 78%. However, males showed the greatest increase in risk from 8.1% in 2000 to 16.0% in 2015, a relative increase of 97%. CONCLUSIONS: Current lifetime risk of knee replacement in New Zealand is approximately one in six for males and females. This lifetime risk has increased significantly from 2000 to 2015. These results can be used to guide public health policy planning and division of public health resources. ?

"Pathogen reservoir hypothesis investigated by analyses of the adenotonsillar and middle ear microbiota",2019,"Introduction: Adenotonsillar and middle ear diseases result in some of the most frequently performed operations in the pediatric population worldwide. The pathogen reservoir hypothesis (PRH) suggests that the adenoids act as a reservoir of bacteria which play a potential pathogenic role in otitis media. Evidence supporting this hypothesis is limited. This study sought to comprehensively determine and compare associations between the adenotonsillar and middle ear bacterial microbiota within individual patients via next-generation sequencing and microbial network analyses. Methods: Bacterial 16S rRNA gene-targeted amplicon sequencing was used to determine the bacterial composition of ten pediatric patients undergoing adenotonsillectomy and ventilation tube insertion for otitis media with effusion. At the time of surgery, swabs were taken from the adenoid surface, tonsil crypts and middle ear clefts (through the myringotomy incision). Results: The most abundant sequences within the bacterial community at genus level across all anatomical sites were Fusobacterium, Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Porphyromonas. There was an observable difference in the relative abundance of bacterial communities, with a higher proportion of Haemophilus and Moraxella in the adenoid when compared with the middle ear. Furthermore, only one module (consisting of 4 bacterial OTUs) from one patient was identified through microbial network analyses to be significantly associated between middle ear and adenoid. In addition, microbial network analysis revealed that the adenoid and tonsil microbiota share greater similarity than do the adenoid and middle ear. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that the adenoid microenvironment does not correlate to the middle ear microenvironment. A future study at the species level, and over time, is required to further investigate whether the differing relationship between the microbiota of the adenoid and middle ear rejects the pathogen reservoir hypothesis. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","RNA 16S; RNA 16S; adenoid; adenotonsillar; adenotonsillectomy; anatomical variation; Article; child; clinical article; correlational study; female; Fusobacterium; Haemophilus; human; male; microbial community; middle ear; middle ear cleft; middle ear disease; Moraxella; myringotomy; Neisseria; next generation sequencing; otitis media; population abundance; Porphyromonas; preschool child; priority journal; school child; species composition; tonsil crypt; tonsil disease; upper respiratory tract; adenoidectomy; bacterium; disease carrier; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; middle ear; middle ear ventilation; palatine tonsil; secretory otitis media; tonsillectomy; Adenoidectomy; Adenoids; Bacteria; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Reservoirs; Ear, Middle; Female; Fusobacterium; Haemophilus; Humans; Male; Microbiota; Middle Ear Ventilation; Moraxella; Neisseria; Otitis Media with Effusion; Palatine Tonsil; Porphyromonas; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Tonsillectomy"
"Relationships between Early Neonatal Nutrition and Neurodevelopment at School Age in Children Born Very Preterm",2020,"Objectives:The aim of this study was to determine whether a new nutrition protocol designed to increase early protein intakes while reducing fluid volume in infants born very preterm was associated with altered neurodevelopment and growth in childhood.Methods:A retrospective, observational cohort study of children born <30 weeks' gestation or <1500 g and admitted to the neonatal unit, National Women's Hospital, Auckland, New Zealand, before and after a change in nutrition protocol. The primary outcome was neurodevelopmental impairment at 7 years (any of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children full scale IQ < 85, Movement Assessment Battery for Children-2 total score ?5th centile, cerebral palsy, blind, or deaf requiring aids). Outcomes were compared between groups and for the overall cohort using generalized linear regression, adjusted for sex and birth weight z score.Results:Of 201 eligible children, 128 (64%) were assessed (55/89 [62%] exposed to the old nutrition protocol, 73 of 112 [65%] to the new protocol). Children who experienced the new protocol received more protein, less energy, and less carbohydrate in postnatal days 1 to 7. Neurodevelopmental impairment was similar at 7 years (30/73 [41%] vs 25/55 [45%], adjusted odds ratio [AOR] [95% confidence interval] 0.78 [0.35-1.70], P = 0.55), as was the incidence of cerebral palsy (AOR 7.36 [0.88-61.40], P = 0.07). Growth and body composition were also similar between groups. An extra 1 g/kg parenteral protein intake in postnatal days 1 to 7 was associated with a 27% increased odds of cerebral palsy (AOR 1.27 [1.03-1.57], P = 0.006).Conclusions:Higher early protein intakes do not change overall rates of neurodevelopmental impairment or growth at 7 years. Further research is needed to determine the effects of higher early parenteral protein intake on motor development. ? ESPGHAN and NASPGHAN.

"Potential for the Remediation of Methamphetamine Contamination Using Ozone,",2019,"The deposition of methamphetamine within indoor environments due to illegal activities can pose a health risk for occupants. Current cleaning techniques are costly and inefficient, calling for the development of alternative remediation methods. In addition, the fate of methamphetamine in indoor environments is largely unknown, negatively impacting our knowledge on the health risks associated with contaminated dwellings. Under the conditions of this study, 97% of surface deposited methamphetamine on a paper substrate was consumed after 12?min of exposure to ozone, thus demonstrating potential for its use as a remediation agent. The reaction had an effective second-order rate constant with an upper limit of 2.15?±?1?×?10?18?cm3/molecule/s, and the main product observed was phenyl-2-propanone (P2P) at 8.3% yield, as determined using GC/MS. Several products observed in this study have also been reported as by-products of methamphetamine synthesis, including P2P—a known methamphetamine precursor, which indicates that their detection at a potential clandestine site is not necessarily evidence of manufacture. ? 2019 American Academy of Forensic Sciences","central stimulant agent; methamphetamine; ozone; drug traffic; ecosystem restoration; human; indoor air pollution; photochemical smog; procedures; surface property; Air Pollution, Indoor; Central Nervous System Stimulants; Drug Trafficking; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Humans; Methamphetamine; Oxidants, Photochemical; Ozone; Surface Properties"
"Intrapancreatic fat deposition and visceral fat volume are associated with the presence of diabetes after acute pancreatitis",2019,"Ectopic fat and abdominal adiposity phenotypes have never been studied holistically in individuals after acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of the study was to investigate phenotypical differences in ectopic fat and abdominal fat between individuals after AP (with and without diabetes) and to determine the role of pancreatitis-related factors. Eighty-four individuals were studied cross-sec-tionally after a median of 21.5 mo since last episode of AP and were categorized into “diabetes” and “no diabetes” groups. Twenty-eight healthy volunteers were also recruited. With the use of magnetic resonance imaging, intrapancreatic fat percentage, liver fat percentage, visceral fat volume (VFV), subcutaneous fat volume, and viscer-al-to-subcutaneous (V/S) fat volume ratio were quantified. Analysis of variance was used to investigate the differences in these phenotypes between the groups. All analyses were adjusted for age and sex. Linear regression analysis was used to investigate the association between pancreatitis-related factors and the studied phenotypes. Intrapancreatic fat percentage was significantly higher in the diabetes group (10.2 = 1.2%) compared with the no diabetes (9.2 = 1.7%) and healthy volunteers (7.9 = 1.9%) groups (P ± 0.001). VFV was significantly higher in the diabetes (2,715.3 =1,077.6 cm3) compared with no diabetes (1,983.2 = 1,092.4 cm3) and healthy volunteer (1,126.2 = 740.4 cm3) groups (P ± 0.001). V/S fat volume ratio was significantly higher in the diabetes (0.97 = 0.27) compared with no diabetes (0.68 = 0.42) and healthy volunteer (0.52 = 0.34) groups (P = 0.001). Biliary AP was associated with significantly higher intrapancreatic fat percentage (β =0.67; 95% CI, 0.01, 1.33; P = 0.047). C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization for AP were associated with significantly higher VFV (β =3.32; 95% CI, 1.68, 4.96; P ± 0.001). In conclusion, individuals with diabetes after AP have higher intrapancreatic fat percentage, VFV, and V/S fat volume ratio. Levels of C-reactive protein during AP are significantly associated with VFV, whereas biliary AP is significantly associated with intrapancreatic fat percentage. NEW &amp; NOTEWORTHY Individuals with diabetes after acute pancreatitis have significantly higher intrapancreatic fat percentage and visceral fat volume compared with individuals without diabetes after acute pancreatitis and healthy controls. C-reactive protein levels during hospitalization for acute pancreatitis and biliary etiology of acute pancreatitis are associated with significantly larger visceral fat and pancreatic fat depots, respectively. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","C reactive protein; hemoglobin A1c; C reactive protein; abdominal obesity; acute pancreatitis; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; digestive tract parameters; female; follow up; hospitalization; human; intra-abdominal fat; intrapancreatic fat deposition; leukocyte count; lipid storage; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; priority journal; subcutaneous fat volume; visceral fat volume; visceral to subcutaneous fat volume ratio; complication; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic imaging; immunology; intra-abdominal fat; metabolism; middle aged; New Zealand; pancreas; pancreatitis; pathology; C-Reactive Protein; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Pancreas; Pancreatitis"
"Eligibility and subsequent burden of cardiovascular disease of four strategies for blood pressure-lowering treatment: a retrospective cohort study",2019,"Background: Worldwide treatment recommendations for lowering blood pressure continue to be guided predominantly by blood pressure thresholds, despite strong evidence that the benefits of blood pressure reduction are observed in patients across the blood pressure spectrum. In this study, we aimed to investigate the implications of alternative strategies for offering blood pressure treatment, using the UK as an illustrative example. Methods: We did a retrospective cohort study in primary care patients aged 30–79 years without cardiovascular disease, using data from the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink linked to Hospital Episode Statistics and Office for National Statistics mortality. We assessed and compared four different strategies to determine eligibility for treatment: using 2011 UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline, or proposed 2019 NICE guideline, or blood pressure alone (threshold ?140/90 mm Hg), or predicted 10-year cardiovascular risk alone (QRISK2 score ?10%). Patients were followed up until the earliest occurrence of a cardiovascular disease diagnosis, death, or end of follow-up period (March 31, 2016). For each strategy, we estimated the proportion of patients eligible for treatment and number of cardiovascular events that could be prevented with treatment. We then estimated eligibility and number of events that would occur during 10 years in the UK general population. Findings: Between Jan 1, 2011, and March 31, 2016, 1 222 670 patients in the cohort were followed up for a median of 4·3 years (IQR 2·5–5·2). 271 963 (22·2%) patients were eligible for treatment under the 2011 NICE guideline, 327 429 (26·8%) under the proposed 2019 NICE guideline, 481 859 (39·4%) on the basis of a blood pressure threshold of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, and 357 840 (29·3%) on the basis of a QRISK2 threshold of 10% or higher. During follow-up, 32 183 patients were diagnosed with cardiovascular disease (overall rate 7·1 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 7·0–7·2). Cardiovascular event rates in patients eligible for each strategy were 15·2 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 15·0–15·5) under the 2011 NICE guideline, 14·9 (14·7–15·1) under the proposed 2019 NICE guideline, 11·4 (11·3–11·6) with blood pressure threshold alone, and 16·9 (16·7–17·1) with QRISK2 threshold alone. Scaled to the UK population, we estimated that 233 152 events would be avoided under the 2011 NICE guideline (28 patients needed to treat for 10 years to avoid one event), 270 233 under the 2019 NICE guideline (29 patients), 301 523 using a blood pressure threshold (38 patients), and 322 921 using QRISK2 threshold (27 patients). Interpretation: A cardiovascular risk-based strategy (QRISK2 ?10%) could prevent over a third more cardiovascular disease events than the 2011 NICE guideline and a fifth more than the 2019 NICE guideline, with similar efficiency regarding number treated per event avoided.

"Inhibiting APOBEC3 Activity with Single-Stranded DNA Containing 2′-Deoxyzebularine Analogues",2019,"APOBEC3 enzymes form part of the innate immune system by deaminating cytosine to uracil in single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and thereby preventing the spread of pathogenic genetic information. However, APOBEC mutagenesis is also exploited by viruses and cancer cells to increase rates of evolution, escape adaptive immune responses, and resist drugs. This raises the possibility of APOBEC3 inhibition as a strategy for augmenting existing antiviral and anticancer therapies. Here we show that, upon incorporation into short ssDNAs, the cytidine nucleoside analogue 2′-deoxyzebularine (dZ) becomes capable of inhibiting the catalytic activity of selected APOBEC variants derived from APOBEC3A, APOBEC3B, and APOBEC3G, supporting a mechanism in which ssDNA delivers dZ to the active site. Multiple experimental approaches, including isothermal titration calorimetry, fluorescence polarization, protein thermal shift, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy assays, demonstrate nanomolar dissociation constants and low micromolar inhibition constants. These dZ-containing ssDNAs constitute the first substrate-like APOBEC3 inhibitors and, together, comprise a platform for developing nucleic acid-based inhibitors with cellular activity. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","Dissociation; DNA; Genes; Immune system; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Nucleic acids; Viruses; Adaptive immune response; Anti-cancer therapies; Experimental approaches; Fluorescence polarization; Innate immune systems; Isothermal titration calorimetry; Nanomolar dissociation; Nucleoside analogues; Catalyst activity; 2' deoxyzebularine; APOBEC3 protein; APOBEC3A protein; APOBEC3B protein; apolipoprotein B messenger RNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 3G; hydrolase; single stranded DNA; unclassified drug; zebularine; 2'-deoxyzebularine; APOBEC3A protein, human; APOBEC3B protein, human; APOBEC3G protein, human; apolipoprotein B messenger RNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide 3G; cytidine; cytidine deaminase; enzyme inhibitor; minor histocompatibility antigen; protein; single stranded DNA; Article; catalysis; controlled study; dissociation constant; enzyme active site; enzyme inhibition; fluorescence polarization; human; human cell; inhibition constant; isothermal titration calorimetry; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; priority journal; chemistry; metabolism; APOBEC-3G Deaminase; Cytidine; Cytidine Deaminase; DNA, Single-Stranded; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Minor Histocompatibility Antigens; Proteins"
"Acute Effects of Heat-Not-Burn, Electronic Vaping, and Traditional Tobacco Combustion Cigarettes: The Sapienza University of Rome-Vascular Assessment of Proatherosclerotic Effects of Smoking (SUR-VAPES) 2 Randomized Trial",2019,"Background: Little clinical research on new-generation heat-not-burn cigarettes (HNBC) in comparison with electronic vaping cigarettes (EVC) and traditional tobacco combustion cigarettes (TC) has been reported. We aimed to appraise the acute effects of single use of HNBC, EVC, and TC in healthy smokers. Methods and Results: This was an independent, cross-over, randomized trial in 20 TC smokers, with allocation to different cycles of HNBC, EVC, and TC. All participants used all types of products, with an intercycle washout of 1?week. End points were oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, platelet activation, flow-mediated dilation, blood pressure, and satisfaction scores. Single use of any product led to an adverse impact on oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, platelet function, flow-mediated dilation, and blood pressure. HNBC had less impact than EVC and TC on soluble Nox2-derived peptide (respectively, P=0.004 and 0.001), 8-iso-prostaglandin F2α-III (P=0.004 and &lt;0.001), and vitamin E (P=0.018 and 0.044). HNBC and EVC were equally less impactful than TCs on flow-mediated dilation (P=0.872 for HNBC versus EVC), H2O2 (P=0.522), H2O2 breakdown activity (P=0.091), soluble CD40 ligand (P=0.849), and soluble P-selectin (P=0.821). The effect of HNBC and, to a lesser extent EVC, on blood pressure was less evident than that of TC, whereas HNBC appeared more satisfying than EVC (all P&lt;0.05). Conclusions: Acute effects of HNBC, EVC, and TC are different on several oxidative stress, antioxidant reserve, platelet function, cardiovascular, and satisfaction dimensions, with TCs showing the most detrimental changes in clinically relevant features.

"Anatomically based simulation of hepatic perfusion in the human liver",2019,"Liver structures of a healthy subject are digitised and segmented from computed tomography (CT) images, and hepatic perfusion is modelled in the hepatic artery and portal vein of the healthy subject with structured tree-based outflow boundary conditions. This self-similar structured tree is widely used in the literature, eg, blood flow simulation in larger systemic arteries and cerebral circulation, and is used in this study to model the effect of the smaller hepatic arteries and arterioles, as well as the smaller hepatic portal veins and portal venules. Physiologically reasonable results are obtained. Since the structured tree terminates at the size of the microvasculature system in liver lobules, the structured tree boundary condition will enable the proposed organ-level model of hepatic arterial flow to be easily connected to tissue-level models of liver lobules. Blood flow in the hepatic vein is also modelled in this subject with three-element Windkessel model as outflow boundary conditions. The benefit of integrating the perfusion in all hepatic vascular vessels is that it helps us analyse some complicated clinical phenomenon more efficiently, eg, one possible application is to obtain the portal pressure gradient (PPG) to help examine the reliability of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) as an indirect measure of portal pressure.

The association between small-for-gestational-age (SGA) foetuses and stillbirth is well established, and observational studies suggest that improved antenatal detection of SGA babies may halve the stillbirth rate. The Growth Assessment Protocol (GAP) describes a complex intervention that includes risk assessment for SGA and screening using customised fundal-height growth charts. Increased detection of SGA from the use of GAP has been implicated in the reduction of stillbirth rates by 22%, in observational studies of UK regions where GAP uptake was high. This study will be the first randomised controlled trial examining the clinical efficacy, health economics and implementation of the GAP programme in the antenatal detection of SGA. Methods/design: In this randomised controlled trial, clusters comprising a maternity unit (or National Health Service Trust) were randomised to either implementation of the GAP programme, or standard care. The primary outcome is the rate of antenatal ultrasound detection of SGA in infants found to be SGA at birth by both population and customised standards, as this is recognised as being the group with highest risk for perinatal morbidity and mortality. Secondary outcomes include antenatal detection of SGA by population centiles, antenatal detection of SGA by customised centiles, short-term maternal and neonatal outcomes, resource use and economic consequences, and a process evaluation of GAP implementation. Qualitative interviews will be performed to assess facilitators and barriers to implementation of GAP. Discussion: This study will be the first to provide data and outcomes from a randomised controlled trial investigating the potential difference between the GAP programme compared to standard care for antenatal ultrasound detection of SGA infants. Accurate information on the performance and service provision requirements of the GAP protocol has the potential to inform national policy decisions on methods to reduce the rate of stillbirth.

"Structural Modifications of the Antiinflammatory Oxicam Scaffold and Preparation of Anticancer Organometallic Compounds",2019,"Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have chemopreventive effects in several cancer types, and the oxicam-based NSAIDs meloxicam and piroxicam exhibit potential to treat cancer. We prepared a series of novel oxicams and coordinated them to Ru II (cym)Cl and Os II (cym)Cl moieties (η 6 -p-cymene = cym). The oxicam ligands acted either as monodentate N-donors or bidentate N,O-chelators, depending upon the ligand structure as well as reaction conditions such as the pH value and solvent used in the reaction. The cytotoxic activity of the complexes toward carcinoma cells was investigated. The isoxazolyl motif-containing ligand 1 and its complexes with Ru II (cym)Cl 1a and the Os analogue 1b proved to have anticancer activity with IC 50 values in a range similar to that observed for the Ru III investigational drug IT-139, and in general the Os compounds were equally or even slightly more potent than the Ru derivatives. Since meloxicam is known as a selective inhibitor of COX-2, molecular docking studies were carried out to understand the possible interactions of the compounds with COX-2, where the organic ligands gave higher scores than their organometallic counterparts. ?

"A realist evaluation of local networks designed to achieve more integrated care",2019,"Introduction: Not surprisingly given their multi-component nature, initiatives to improve integrated care often evolve to find the best way to bring about change. This paper provides an example of how an evaluation evolved alongside such an initiative designed to better integrate care across primary, community and hospital services in South Auckland, New Zealand. Theory and methods: Using the explanatory power of a realist evaluative approach, theories of new ways of working that might be prompted by the initiative were explored in: (i) interviews with stakeholders in 2012 and 2015, (ii) online surveys of general practices and local care organisations, and (iii) a purposive sample of ten general practices. Results: The results highlighted the institutional contexts that led to difficulties in implementing population health initiatives. They also revealed that changes in work practices focussed mostly on activities that improved the coordination of care for individuals at risk of hospital admissions. Discussion: Multi-component complex interventions can vary in their delivery and be vulnerable to one or more components not being implemented as originally intended. In the case of this intervention, the move towards strengthening local relationships arose when contractual arrangements stalled. Realist evaluative approaches offer a logic that helps unpick the complexity of the relationships and politics in play, and uncover the assumptions made by those developing, implementing and assessing health service changes. Conclusion: Given the multi-component and evolving nature of initiatives seeking to better integrate care, the realist evaluative emphasis on surfacing early the theories to explain how change is expected to occur helps overcome the challenge of evaluating “a moving targetA.. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; article; coordination; general practice; hospital admission; hospital service; human; interview; logic; New Zealand; organization; population health; purposive sample; theoretical study"
"Exploring the Asian ethnic predisposition to dry eye disease in a pediatric population",2019,"Purpose: To investigate the differences in ocular surface characteristics, tear film parameters, and dry eye symptomology between co-located pediatric populations of Asian and Caucasian ethnicity. Methods: Seventy New Zealand-born pediatric participants, aged between 5 and 18 years, were recruited in an age and environmentally controlled cross-sectional study. Participants were classified into three groups according to ethnicity and eyelid morphology: Asian single lid (ASL), Asian double lid (ADL), and Caucasian double lid (CDL). Ocular biometry, tear film parameters, ocular surface characteristics, and dry eye symptomology were evaluated in a single clinical session. Results: Overall, no significant intergroup differences were observed in tear film quality, dry eye symptomology, and meibomian gland dropout. A higher proportion of ASL and ADL participants exhibited incomplete blinking than the Caucasian group (both p < 0.001). Meibomian gland shortening was more frequently observed among the two Asian groups (both p < 0.05), while gland tortuosity was more common in the Caucasian group (both p < 0.001). ASL participants exhibited greater inferior lid wiper epitheliopathy grades than ADL participants (p = 0.01), and corneal astigmatism was more pronounced in the ASL than CDL group (p = 0.02). Conclusions: Ethnic differences in meibomian gland morphological patterns were observed in the current pediatric cohort, although overall meibomian gland dropout did not differ between groups. Asian participants exhibited a higher degree of incomplete blinking, and more marked inferior lid wiper epitheliopathy and corneal astigmatism were observed in the ASL group. These findings would suggest that eyelid anatomy and tension may potentially be implicated in the development of ethnic differences in dry eye disease later in life. ? 2018","adolescent; adult; Article; Asian; astigmatism; best corrected visual acuity; biometry; blinking; child; cornea curvature; cross-sectional study; disease predisposition; dry eye; ethnicity; female; human; male; meibomian gland; observational study; refraction error; tear film; tear osmolarity"
"Glucose Counter-regulation after Acute Pancreatitis",2019,"Objectives Persistent hyperglycemia is a common sequela of acute pancreatitis (AP). The role of counter-regulatory hormones in maintaining glucose homeostasis has been largely studied during the course of AP, but not after clinical resolution of the disease. The objectives of this study were to investigate the associations between circulating levels of glucagon, cortisol, and human growth hormone and glucose homeostasis after AP as well as their associations with a comprehensive panel of pancreatic hormones, gut peptides, and proinflammatory cytokines. Methods Participants with no history of pre-existing prediabetes or diabetes were categorized into hyperglycemia and normoglycemia after AP groups. Binary logistic regression and linear regression analyses were conducted. Results Eighty-three individuals were included, of whom 19 had hyperglycemia. Glucagon, cortisol, and human growth hormone did not differ significantly between the groups. Glucagon explained up to 86% of the variance in glucagon-like peptide 1, whereas cortisol explained up to 89% of the variance in interleukin 6 in hyperglycemia after AP. Conclusions Counter-regulatory hormones do not appear to play a direct role in the mechanisms underlying hyperglycemia after AP. However, significant associations between glucagon and glucagon-like peptide 1, as well as between cortisol and interleukin 6, suggest that that these hormones may be involved indirectly in the pathophysiology of hyperglycemia after AP. ?

Methods: YouthCHAT was administered to a group of 30 young people aged 13–17 years with different long-term physical conditions attending outpatient clinics between September and December 2017. Outcome measures were: (i) acceptability and feasibility of YouthCHAT as assessed via feedback from young people and clinicians and the time taken to complete YouthCHAT screening; and (ii) detection rates for each domain of YouthCHAT measured by mental health or life-style issues ‘present’ or ‘absent’, and where relevant, validated symptom scores. Results: YouthCHAT was quick to administer and positively received by both young people and clinicians. Rates of anxiety (37%) and depression (13%) detected using YouthCHAT were similar to those in previous studies of young people with long-term physical conditions. Rates of other problems were similar to a previously screened high school sample. Conclusions: YouthCHAT is a viable and acceptable psychosocial screener with the potential to improve the holistic care of young people with long-term physical conditions attending outpatient clinics.

"Suboptimal performance of rotavirus testing in a vaccinated community population should prompt laboratories to review their rotavirus testing algorithms in response to changes in disease prevalence",2019,"Rotavirus vaccine has reduced disease prevalence in many countries. Consequently, we aimed to assess the reliability of a rotavirus immunoassay in the community population of Auckland and Northland, New Zealand. Between 22 October 2015 and 31 December 2016, 2873 fecal samples were tested by enzyme immunoassay (EIA, Rotascreen II, Microgen, UK) from 2748 patients (median age 8 years, range 0–101 years). Eighty-nine (3.1%) samples were reactive; 86 samples were tested by a second method. Rotavirus was confirmed in 49/86 (57%). Positive rotavirus EIAs were more likely to be confirmed in samples from cases ?1 year of age (positive predictive value [PPV] 61%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 50–72%, P = 0.049) and in spring/summer (PPV 67%, 95% CI 55–78%, P = 0.003).

"Siblings of Young People With Cancer in NZ: Experiences That Positively and Negatively Support Well-Being",2019,"Siblings of young people with cancer experience significant distress and these effects often exist long after their sibling’s treatment has successfully been completed. In New Zealand, many families must travel several hours to receive treatment, with some having to live away from home for extended periods which can create additional strains. We interviewed 10 siblings of pediatric cancer survivors drawn from a larger quantitative study, to investigate what made siblings’ experiences more difficult and to find out what was helpful in supporting their adjustment. The selected participants came from across New Zealand, represented a mix of gender and age, and had a range of depression scores. Our thematic analysis found that experiences that were associated with the most distress included concurrent stressors, and feeling left out, rejected, or isolated. Experiences that were most helpful to their well-being were feeling involved, knowing that they were still important and a priority for their parents, connecting with people through their experiences, and focusing on positive experiences. Our findings suggest that professionals working with these families could help siblings of a child with cancer by promoting hope, acknowledging positive growth, drawing attention to positive events to promote benefit finding, and providing opportunities to have fun. Increasing parental awareness of the impact of differential treatment and improving the public understanding of sibling issues might also be helpful. ? 2018 by Association of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology Nurses.",""

"Insights from the coalface: Barriers to accessing medicines and pharmacy services for resettled refugees from Africa",2019,"Resettled refugees in Australia have been shown to exhibit a high prevalence of limited health literacy and are at greater risk of mismanaging their medication and not being able to access the healthcare services they need. The aim of the current study is to explore the barriers to accessing medicines and pharmacy services in Queensland, Australia, among resettled refugees from Africa; this research was conducted from the perspectives of healthcare professionals and people who help the refugees to resettle in their adopted country (resettlement workers). A 'generic qualitative' approach was used in this study. In-depth interviews were conducted among healthcare professionals (two GPs, nine pharmacists and three nurse practitioners) and resettlement workers. Participants were recruited via a purposive snowball sampling method in the cities of Brisbane and Townsville, Queensland, Australia. Twenty-four in-depth interviews were conducted; 14 with healthcare professionals. Three key themes emerged from the data: (1) Communication Barriers; (2) Navigating the Health System; and (3) Belief Systems and Culture. Perceptions of those 'at the coalface'-healthcare professionals and people who are responsible for assisting refugees to resettle in Australia-provide insight into the language and cultural challenges experienced by resettled refugees from Africa regarding access to the Australian health system, including medicines and pharmacy services. ? 2019 La Trobe University.","adult; Africa; article; city; communication barrier; female; hospital department; human; human experiment; human tissue; interview; language; male; nurse practitioner; perception; pharmacist; primary health care; Queensland; refugee; sampling; worker; Africa; attitude to health; Australia; cultural anthropology; ethnology; health care delivery; health literacy; health personnel attitude; pharmacy (shop); procedures; refugee; transcultural care; Africa; Attitude of Health Personnel; Australia; Communication Barriers; Culturally Competent Care; Culture; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Literacy; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Pharmacies; Queensland; Refugees"

"A phase IIb, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging investigation of the safety and efficacy of NTCELL? [immunoprotected (alginate-encapsulated) porcine choroid plexus cells for xenotransplantation] in patients with Parkinson's disease",2019,"Introduction: Regenerative therapies in Parkinson's disease aim to slow neurodegeneration and re-establish damaged neuronal circuitry. Neurotrophins are potent endogenous regulators of neuronal survival, development and regeneration. They represent an attractive regenerative treatment option in Parkinson's disease. Porcine choroid plexus produces a number of neurotrophins, and can be safely delivered to the striatum in an encapsulated formulation (termed NTCELL?) to protect them from immune attack. NTCELL? has shown regenerative potential in animal models of stroke, Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease. Following promising results from an initial open label safety study of intra-striatal delivery of NTCELL? in human subjects, we sought to specifically investigate the safety and efficacy of NTCELL? for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. Methods: 18 patients aged 56–65 years with idiopathic Parkinson's disease of at least 5 years duration were randomised to receive either sham surgery (general anaesthesia and partial thickness burr holes) or intra-striatal delivery of NTCELL? (the 3 groups in the treatment arm receiving incremental NTCELL? doses). Results: At 26 weeks, we found no significant difference in total UPDRS scores (‘on’ and ‘off’), UPDRS motor scores (‘on’ and ‘off’), PDQ-39, UDysRS, timed walk or modified Hoehn and Yahr stage between patients implanted with NTCELL? and patients undergoing sham procedure. There were no serious adverse events or xenogeneic viral transmission during the study. Conclusion: The study did not meet its primary efficacy end-point of a change in UPDRS at 26 weeks post-intervention compared with baseline.

"The 3-D muscular structure of the human pancreaticobiliary junction",2019,"The musculature of the human pancreaticobiliary junction (PBJ) is implicated in several pathologies and is of significance to clinicians who perform endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). This study sought to describe the musculature of the human PBJ by generating a three-dimensional reconstruction of histologic sections. A single pancreaticoduodenal specimen was removed en bloc from an embalmed cadaver with no pancreaticoduodenal disease. Sections were stained with Masson's trichrome and the staining pattern of muscle fibers was used to generate information regarding their location and orientation. The outline of groups of muscle fibers taken from photomicrographs of alternate thin serial sections were highlighted based upon their orientation (circular or longitudinal) and location (duodenal or papillary). Data point co-ordinates were used to create a 3-D image reconstruction. A total of 91 composite serial cross-sections were reconstructed. Circular and longitudinal muscle fibers formed a completely investing muscle layer around both the bile and pancreatic ducts, and there was a clear distinction between the intrinsic muscles of the PBJ and those of the duodenal wall. Circular fibers were particularly dense distal to the confluence of the ducts. Longitudinal fibers were incompletely distributed around the pancreaticobiliary sphincter and did not extend to the tip of the major duodenal papilla. This model supports the well-established concept of an intrinsic pancreaticobiliary sphincter composed of circular and longitudinal muscle fibers, distinct from the surrounding duodenal muscle. Targeting the distal end of the PBJ during ERCP would only partially disrupt this muscular sphincter mechanism. ? 2019 Sociedad Anatomica Espanola.

"Identifying prognostic structural features in tissue sections of colon cancer patients using point pattern analysis",2019,"Diagnosis and prognosis of cancer are informed by the architecture inherent in cancer patient tissue sections. This architecture is typically identified by pathologists, yet advances in computational image analysis facilitate quantitative assessment of this structure. In this article, we develop a spatial point process approach to describe patterns in cell distribution within tissue samples taken from colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. In particular, our approach is centered on the Palm intensity function. This leads to taking an approximate-likelihood technique in fitting point processes models. We consider two Neyman-Scott point processes and a void process, fitting these point process models to the CRC patient data. We find that the parameter estimates of these models may be used to quantify the spatial arrangement of cells. Importantly, we observe characteristic differences in the spatial arrangement of cells between patients who died from CRC and those alive at follow up. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Article; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; colon cancer; controlled study; human; mathematical computing; mathematical model; point pattern analysis; spatial analysis; statistical analysis; statistical model; survival analysis"
"Role of professional confidence in the development of expert allied health professionals",2019,"BACKGROUND: Although experienced and expert practitioners are valuable resources for the continuing professional development of other healthcare staff, there is not always a desire to take on this role. Sharing expertise benefits other practitioners, the profession, and healthcare overall. When professionals are unwilling to share, it is a missed opportunity to achieve the best outcomes for patients. METHODS: A narrative review of the literature in relation to professional confidence and expertise across allied health disciplines revealed a number of potential threats to professional confidence and consequently willingness to share information in an ‘expert’ role. FINDINGS: There is limited literature addressing development of professional confidence post-qualification, particularly after the first year of practice. Role ambiguity, unclear scope of practice, low professional status, and role conflict all threaten the confidence of practitioners. The importance of reflection as a practice to develop and maintain confidence is highlighted in both the student and practitioner literature. CONCLUSION: Training organisations and health workforce employers should consider how professional confidence can be developed and maintained across the career span, with subsequent benefits for development of expertise and knowledge sharing. Recommendations for reflexive thinking and conversations are included. ? 2019 Association of Schools of Allied Health Professions, Wash., DC.","adult; career; conversation; employer; health workforce; human; narrative; organization; outcome assessment; physician; professional development; review; scope of practice; thinking; clinical competence; education; paramedical personnel; self concept; Allied Health Personnel; Clinical Competence; Humans; Self Efficacy"
"Hypnotherapy for smoking cessation",2019,"Background Hypnotherapy is widely promoted as a method for aiding smoking cessation. It is intended to act on underlying impulses to weaken the desire to smoke, or strengthen the will to stop. Objectives To evaluate the effect and safety of hypnotherapy for smoking cessation. Search methods For this update we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialized Register, and trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), using the terms “smoking cessation” and “hypnotherapy” or “hypnosis”, with no restrictions on language or publication date. The most recent search was performed on 18 July 2018. Selection criteria We considered randomized controlled trials that recruited people who smoked and implemented a hypnotherapy intervention for smoking cessation compared with no treatment, or with any other therapeutic interventions. Trials were required to report smoking cessation rates at least six months after the beginning of treatment. Study eligibility was determined by at least two review authors, independently. Data collection and analysis At least two review authors independently extracted data on participant characteristics, the type and duration of hypnotherapy, the nature of the control group, smoking status, method of randomization, and completeness of follow-up. These authors also independently assessed the quality of the included studies. In undertaking this work, we used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. The main outcome measure was abstinence from smoking after at least six months’ follow-up. We used the most rigorous definition of abstinence in each trial, and biochemically validated abstinence rates where available. Those lost to follow-up were considered to still be smoking. We summarized effects as risk ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Where possible, we performed meta-analysis using a fixed-effect model. We also noted any adverse events reported. Main results We included three new trials in this update, which brings the total to 14 included studies that compared hypnotherapy with 22 different control interventions. The studies included a total of 1926 participants. Studies were diverse and a single meta-analysis was not possible. We judged only one study to be at low risk of bias overall; we judged 10 studies to be at high risk of bias and three at unclear risk. Studies did not provide reliable evidence of a greater benefit from hypnotherapy compared with other interventions or no treatment for smoking cessation. Most individual studies did not find statistically significant differences in quit rates after six months or longer, and studies that did detect differences typically had methodological limitations. Pooling small groups of relatively comparable studies did not provide reliable evidence for a specific effect of hypnotherapy relative to controls. There was low certainty evidence, limited by imprecision and risk of bias, that showed no statistically significant difference between hypnotherapy and attention-matched behavioural treatments (RR 1.21, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.61; I2 = 36%; 6 studies, 957 participants). Results were similarly imprecise, and also limited by risk of bias, when comparing hypnotherapy to intensive behavioural interventions (not matched for contact time) (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.47 to 1.82; I2 = 0%; 2 studies, 211 participants; very low certainty evidence). Results from one small study (40 participants) detected a statistically significant benefit of hypnotherapy compared to no intervention (RR 19.00, 95% CI 1.18 to 305.88), but this evidence was judged to be of very low certainty due to high risk of bias and imprecision. No significant differences were detected in comparisons of hypnotherapy with brief behavioural interventions (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.69; I? = 0%; 2 studies, 269 participants), rapid/focused smoking (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.43 to 2.33; I2 = 65%; 2 studies, 54 participants), and pharmacotherapies (RR 1.68, 95% CI 0.88 to 3.20; I2 = 5%; 2 studies, 197 participants). When hypnotherapy was evaluated as an adjunct to other treatments, the pooled result from five studies showed a statistically significant benefit in favour of hypnotherapy (RR 2.10, 95% CI 1.31 to 3.35; I? = 62%; 224 participants); however, this result should be interpreted with caution due to the high risk of bias across studies (four had a high risk or bias, one had an unclear risk), and substantial statistical heterogeneity. Most studies did not provide information on whether data specifically relating to adverse events were collected, and whether or not any adverse events occurred. One study that did collect such data did not find a statistically significant difference in the adverse event ‘index’ between hypnotherapy and relaxation. Authors’ conclusions There is insufficient evidence to determine whether hypnotherapy is more effective for smoking cessation than other forms of behavioural support or unassisted quitting. If a benefit is present, current evidence suggests the benefit is small at most. There is very little evidence on whether hypnotherapy causes adverse effects, but the existing data show no evidence that it does. Further large, high-quality randomized controlled trials, and more comprehensive assessments of safety, are needed on this topic. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

"Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation",2019,"Background Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) aims to replace nicotine from cigarettes to ease the transition from cigarette smoking to abstinence. It works by reducing the intensity of craving and withdrawal symptoms. Although there is clear evidence that NRT used after smoking cessation is effective, it is unclear whether higher doses, longer durations of treatment, or using NRT before cessation add to its effectiveness. Objectives To determine the effectiveness and safety of different forms, deliveries, doses, durations and schedules of NRT, for achieving long-term smoking cessation, compared to one another. Search methods We searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group trials register, and trial registries for papers mentioning NRT in the title, abstract or keywords. Date of most recent search: April 2018. Selection criteria Randomized trials in people motivated to quit, comparing one type of NRT use with another. We excluded trials that did not assess cessation as an outcome, with follow-up less than six months, and with additional intervention components not matched between arms. Trials comparing NRT to control, and trials comparing NRT to other pharmacotherapies, are covered elsewhere. Data collection and analysis We followed standard Cochrane methods. Smoking abstinence was measured after at least six months, using the most rigorous definition available. We extracted data on cardiac adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), and study withdrawals due to treatment. We calculated the risk ratio (RR) and the 95% confidence interval (CI) for each outcome for each study, where possible. We grouped eligible studies according to the type of comparison. We carried out meta-analyses where appropriate, using a Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect model. Main results We identified 63 trials with 41,509 participants. Most recruited adults either from the community or from healthcare clinics. People enrolled in the studies typically smoked at least 15 cigarettes a day. We judged 24 of the 63 studies to be at high risk of bias, but restricting the analysis only to those studies at low or unclear risk of bias did not significantly alter results, apart from in the case of the preloading comparison. There is high-certainty evidence that combination NRT (fast-acting form + patch) results in higher long-term quit rates than single form (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.15 to 1.36, 14 studies, 11,356 participants; I 2 = 4%). Moderate-certainty evidence, limited by imprecision, indicates that 42/44 mg are as effective as 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.93 to 1.29, 5 studies, 1655 participants; I 2 = 38%), and that 21 mg are more effective than 14 mg (24-hour) patches (RR 1.48, 95% CI 1.06 to 2.08, 1 study, 537 participants). Moderate-certainty evidence (again limited by imprecision) also suggests a benefit of 25 mg over 15 mg (16-hour) patches, but the lower limit of the CI encompassed no difference (RR 1.19, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.41, 3 studies, 3446 participants; I 2 = 0%). Five studies comparing 4 mg gum to 2 mg gum found a benefit of the higher dose (RR 1.43, 95% CI 1.12 to 1.83, 5 studies, 856 participants; I 2 = 63%); however, results of a subgroup analysis suggest that only smokers who are highly dependent may benefit. Nine studies tested the effect of using NRT prior to quit day (preloading) in comparison to using it from quit day onward; there was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias, of a favourable effect of preloading on abstinence (RR 1.25, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.44, 9 studies, 4395 participants; I 2 = 0%). High-certainty evidence from eight studies suggests that using either a form of fast-acting NRT or a nicotine patch results in similar long-term quit rates (RR 0.90, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.05, 8 studies, 3319 participants; I 2 = 0%). We found no evidence of an effect of duration of nicotine patch use (low-certainty evidence); 16-hour versus 24-hour daily patch use; duration of combination NRT use (low-and very low-certainty evidence); tapering of patch dose versus abrupt patch cessation; fast-acting NRT type (very low-certainty evidence); duration of nicotine gum use; ad lib versus fixed dosing of fast-acting NRT; free versus purchased NRT; length of provision of free NRT; ceasing versus continuing patch use on lapse; and participant-versus clinician-selected NRT. However, in most cases these findings are based on very low-or low-certainty evidence, and are the findings from single studies. AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment were all measured variably and infrequently across studies, resulting in low-or very low-certainty evidence for all comparisons. Most comparisons found no evidence of an effect on cardiac AEs, SAEs or withdrawals. Rates of these were low overall. Significantly more withdrawals due to treatment were reported in participants using nasal spray in comparison to patch in one trial (RR 3.47, 95% CI 1.15 to 10.46, 922 participants; very low certainty) and in participants using 42/44 mg patches in comparison to 21/22 mg patches across two trials (RR 4.99, 95% CI 1.60 to 15.50, 2 studies, 544 participants; I 2 = 0%; low certainty). Authors’ conclusions There is high-certainty evidence that using combination NRT versus single-form NRT, and 4 mg versus 2 mg nicotine gum, can increase the chances of successfully stopping smoking. For patch dose comparisons, evidence was of moderate certainty, due to imprecision. Twenty-one mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than 14 mg (24-hour) patches, and using 25 mg patches resulted in higher quit rates than using 15 mg (16-hour) patches, although in the latter case the CI included one. There was no clear evidence of superiority for 42/44 mg over 21/22 mg (24-hour) patches. Using a fast-acting form of NRT, such as gum or lozenge, resulted in similar quit rates to nicotine patches. There is moderate-certainty evidence that using NRT prior to quitting may improve quit rates versus using it from quit date only; however, further research is needed to ensure the robustness of this finding. Evidence for the comparative safety and tolerability of different types of NRT use is of low and very low certainty. New studies should ensure that AEs, SAEs and withdrawals due to treatment are both measured and reported. ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

"Ethnic differences in atrial fibrillation in patients with heart failure from Asia-Pacific",2019,"Objective Ethnic differences in the prevalence of atrial fibrillation (AF) in heart failure (HF) remain unclear. We compared the prevalence and clinical correlates of AF among different ethnicities in an Asian-Pacific population with HF. Methods Patients with validated HF were prospectively studied across Singapore and New Zealand (NZ). Results Among 1746 patients with HF (62% Asian, 26% women, mean age 66 (SD 13) years, mean ejection fraction (EF) 37 (SD 16%), 39% had AF. The prevalence of AF was markedly lower in Singapore-Asians than NZ-Europeans (24% vs 63%; p<0.001), even after adjusting for age, clinical and echocardiographic covariates, regardless of EF group (p interaction for EF=0.39). Patients with AF were older, had higher body mass index and were more likely to have a history of hypertension, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, chronic respiratory disease and increased alcohol intake, but less likely to have diabetes. Clinical correlates were similar for Asians and NZ-Europeans, except diabetes: Asian diabetic patients with HF had less AF compared with Asian patients without diabetes (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.50 to 0.88), whereas among NZ-Europeans there was no significant association between diabetes and AF (OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.75) (p interaction for ethnicity=0.01). AF was associated with a higher crude composite outcome of mortality and HF hospitalisations at 2 years (HR 1.19, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.38). Conclusion There is a strikingly lower prevalence of AF among Asian compared with NZ-European patients with HF. The underlying mechanisms for the lower prevalence of AF among Asians, particularly in the presence of diabetes, deserve further study. Trial registration number ACTRN12610000374066. ?

"Machine learning SNP based prediction for precision medicine",2019,"In the past decade, precision genomics based medicine has emerged to provide tailored and effective healthcare for patients depending upon their genetic features. Genome Wide Association Studies have also identified population based risk genetic variants for common and complex diseases. In order to meet the full promise of precision medicine, research is attempting to leverage our increasing genomic understanding and further develop personalized medical healthcare through ever more accurate disease risk prediction models. Polygenic risk scoring and machine learning are two primary approaches for disease risk prediction. Despite recent improvements, the results of polygenic risk scoring remain limited due to the approaches that are currently used. By contrast, machine learning algorithms have increased predictive abilities for complex disease risk. This increase in predictive abilities results from the ability of machine learning algorithms to handle multi-dimensional data. Here, we provide an overview of polygenic risk scoring and machine learning in complex disease risk prediction. We highlight recent machine learning application developments and describe how machine learning approaches can lead to improved complex disease prediction, which will help to incorporate genetic features into future personalized healthcare. Finally, we discuss how the future application of machine learning prediction models might help manage complex disease by providing tissue-specific targets for customized, preventive interventions.

"Aiming for the elimination of viral hepatitis in Australia, New Zealand, and the Pacific Islands and Territories: Where are we now and barriers to meeting World Health Organization targets by 2030",2019,"Viral hepatitis affects more than 320 million people globally, leading to significant morbidity and mortality due to liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). More than 248 million people (3.2% globally) are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV), and an estimated 80 million people (1.1% globally) are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV). In 2015, more than 700?000 deaths were directly attributable to HBV, and nearly 500?000 deaths were attributable to HCV infection; 2–5% of HBV-infected people develop HCC per annum irrespective of the presence of cirrhosis, whereas 1–5% HCV-infected people with advanced fibrosis develop HCC per annum. The rapidly escalating global mortality related to HBV and HCV related viral hepatitis to be the 7th leading cause of death worldwide in 2013, from 10th leading cause in 1990. Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Island Countries and Territories fall within the World Health Organization Western Pacific Region, which has a high prevalence of viral hepatitis and related morbidity, particularly HBV. Remarkably, in this region, HBV-related mortality is greater than for tuberculosis, HIV infection, and malaria combined. The region provides a unique contrast in viral hepatitis prevalence, health system resources, and approaches taken to achieve World Health Organization global elimination targets for HBV and HCV infection. This review highlights the latest evidence in viral hepatitis epidemiology and explores the health resources available to combat viral hepatitis, focusing on the major challenges and critical needs to achieve elimination in Australia, New Zealand, and Pacific Island Countries and Territories. ? 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","Australia and New Zealand; cause of death; disease burden; health care; health care access; health care planning; health care policy; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; human; liver cancer; liver cirrhosis; liver failure; malaria; Pacific islands; priority journal; Review; tuberculosis; virus hepatitis; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver tumor; mass screening; motivation; virology; virus hepatitis; World Health Organization; Australasia; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Goals; Hepatitis, Viral, Human; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Mass Screening; World Health Organization"
"Gas micronuclei that underlie decompression bubbles and decompression sickness have not been identified",2019,"Gas micronuclei are gas-filled voids in liquids from which bubbles can form at low gas supersaturation. If water is depleted of gas micronuclei, high gas supersaturation is required for bubble formation. This high gas supersaturation is required in part to overcome the Laplace pressure at the point of transition from dissolved gas to a bubble of perhaps nanometer-scale radius. The sum of gas and vapour partial pressures inside a spherical bubble (Pbub) of radius r exceeds the ambient barometric pressure (Pamb) and is given by the Young-LaPlace equation: Pbub = Pamb + 2γ/r for a bubble not in contact with a solid surface. The second term on the right-hand side is the Laplace pressure across the gas-liquid interface due to surface tension (γ). For instance, for a surface tension characteristic of blood of 0.056 N·m??, de novo formation of a bubble of r = 10 nm requires gas supersaturation exceeding 2γ/r = 11.2 MPa. However, in humans, detectable venous gas bubbles follow decompression to sea level from as shallow as 138 kPa air saturation, implying gas supersaturation of only a few kPa are required for decompression bubble formation. It is widely accepted that bubbles that form at such low gas supersaturation grow from pre-existing, micron-scale gas micronuclei. For such gas micronuclei to already exist prior to gas supersaturation they cannot simply be small bubbles because positive feedback of Laplace pressure causes a micron radius bubble to dissolve in a fraction of a second. Theoretical candidates for gas micronuclei are bubbles coated in surfactants that counteract the Laplace pressure or crevices where gas voids assume shapes that negate the Laplace pressure. However, to date, the nature of gas micronuclei that underly decompression-induced bubbles and decompression sickness have yet to be identified. Consequently, I was intrigued that in two previous issues of Diving and Hyperbaric Medicine (2018 Volume 48, Issue 2, page 114 and Issue 3, page 197), letters from Ran Arieli to the Editor hypothesized a mechanism for decompression bubble formation in blood vessels and in the skin. Both letters stated ""It is known that nanobubbles form spontaneously when a smooth hydrophobic surface is submerged in water containing dissolved gas. We have shown that nanobubbles are the gas micronuclei underlying decompression bubbles and decompression sickness"". Surface nanobubbles have been extensively described in the physical chemistry literature, but the second sentence is supported by citation of an hypothesis article. The latter is based on experimental work (referenced therein) in which sections of large blood vessels from sheep were incubated in saline and compressed to 1.013 MPa for 18 hours then rapidly decompressed to the surface, whereupon macroscopic bubbles were photographed forming on the luminal surface of the vessels. The authors speculate that the bubbles were forming from surface nanobubbles on the vessel lumen, but no experimental or analytical evidence was presented that surface nanobubbles were present on the vessel lumen or were the precursors of the observed macroscopic bubbles. Surface nanobubbles form on atomically smooth, hard surfaces in gas supersaturated liquids and, imaged with atomic force microscopy, appear as spherical caps of gas. As far as I can determine, surface nanobubbles have not been reported on biological tissue surfaces. Surface nanobubbles typically have diameters less than 100 nanometers but have lifetimes that are orders of magnitude longer than would a bubble of similar dimensions. Surface nanobubbles do not grow into macroscopic bubbles when exposed to pressure waves sufficient to cause bubble formation from adventitious gas micronuclei elsewhere in the apparatus. This is surely not the last word in this new and active field of research into nanoscopic gas species; however, based on current evidence one must treat with skepticism speculation that unobserved surface nanobubbles are the gas micronuclei from which bubbles form in humans with low gas supersaturation and which underlie decompression sickness.

"Preoperative immunonutrition in patients undergoing liver resection: A prospective randomized trial",2019,"BACKGROUND Preoperative supplementation with immunonutrients, including arginine and n-3 fatty acids, has been shown in a number of systematic reviews to reduce infectious complications in patients who have undergone gastrointestinal surgery. Limited information, however, is available on the benefits of nutritional supplementation enriched with arginine and n-3 fatty acids in patients undergoing liver resection. AIM To evaluate the effects of preoperative nutritional supplementation enriched with arginine and n-3 fatty acids on inflammatory and immunologic markers and clinical outcome in patients undergoing liver resection. METHODS Thirty-four patients undergoing liver resection were randomized to either five days of preoperative Impact? [1020 kcal/d, immunonutrition (IMN) group], or standard care [no supplementation, standard care (STD) group]. Nutritional status was measured at study entry by subjective global assessment (SGA). Functional assessments (grip strength, fatigue and performance status) were carried out at study entry, on the day prior to surgery, and on postoperative day (POD) 7 and 30. Inflammatory and immune markers were measured at study entry, on the day prior to surgery, and POD 1, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 30. Postoperative complications were recorded prospectively until POD30. RESULTS A total of 32 patients (17 IMN and 15 STD) were analysed. All except four patients were SGA class A. The plasma ratio of (eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid) to arachidonic acid was higher in IMN patients on the day prior to surgery and POD 1, 3, 5 and 7 (P < 0.05). Plasma interleukin (IL)-6 concentrations were elevated in the IMN group (P = 0.017 for POD7). No treatment effect was detected for functional measures, immune response (white cell count and total lymphocytes) or markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein, tumour necrosis factor-α, IL-8, IL-10). There were 10 patients with infectious complications in the IMN group and 4 in the STD group (P = 0.087). Median hospital stay was 9 (range 4-49) d in the IMN group and 8 (3-34) d in the STD group (P = 0.476). CONCLUSION In well-nourished patients undergoing elective liver resection, this study failed to show any benefit of preoperative immunonutrition. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""
"New Zealand adolescents’ concerns about their alcohol use and access to services: Associations with ethnicity and other factors",2019,"Using a national survey of 8,500 New Zealand high school students, we investigated adolescents’ concerns about their drinking, associated factors including help-seeking preferences and access to health care services, and how these varied by ethnicity and level of socioeconomic deprivation. Approximately 23.9% of the 3,704 current drinkers reported concerns (i.e., being worried about their drinking and/or having tried to cut down). Regression analyses revealed that M?ori and Pacific youth were more likely than their New Zealand European peers to be concerned about their drinking. Concerned drinkers were more likely than nonconcerned drinkers to report hazardous drinking behaviors and alcohol-related problems, but these associations varied by age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic deprivation. Help-seeking preferences differed strongly by ethnicity. Concerned drinkers, and M?ori and Pacific drinkers, were more likely to report difficulties accessing health care and alcohol and drug services. The factors associated with adolescents’ drinking concerns and paradoxical difficulties accessing health care highlight the importance of engaging adolescents in developing responsive and equitable services. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis.","adolescent; alcohol consumption; alcoholism; Article; current drinker; ethnic difference; female; health care access; health care disparity; heavy drinking; help seeking behavior; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; socioeconomics"
"Googling Gout: Exploring Perceptions About Gout Through a Linguistic Analysis of Online Search Activities",2019,"Objective: To understand what terms people seeking information about gout use most frequently in online searches and to explore the psychological and emotional tone of these searches. Methods: A large de-identified data set of search histories from major search engines was analyzed. Participants who searched for gout (n = 1,117), arthritis (arthritis search control group, age and sex-matched, n = 2,036), and a random set of age and sex-matched participants (general control group, n = 2,150) were included. Searches were analyzed using Meaning Extraction Helper and Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count. Results: The most frequent unique searches in the gout search group included gout-related and food-related terms. Those who searched for gout were most likely to search for words related to eating or avoidance. In contrast, those who searched for arthritis were more likely to search for disease- or health-related words. Compared with the general control group, higher information seeking was observed for the gout and arthritis search groups. Compared with the general control group, both the gout and arthritis search groups searched for more food-related words and fewer leisure and sex-related words. The searches of both the gout and arthritis search groups were lower in positivity and higher in the frequency of sadness-related words. Conclusion: The perception of gout as a condition managed by dietary strategies aligns with online information seeking about the disease and its management. In contrast, people searching for information about arthritis focus more on medical strategies. Linguistic analyses reflect greater disability in social and leisure activities and lower positive emotion for those searching for gout or arthritis. ? 2018, American College of Rheumatology","adult; arthritis; Article; avoidance behavior; controlled study; eating; emotionality; female; gout; groups by age; human; information seeking; leisure; linguistics; major clinical study; male; middle aged; online analysis; perception; psychological aspect; sadness; sex; young adult; adolescent; factual database; gout; linguistics; procedures; psychology; search engine; Adolescent; Adult; Databases, Factual; Female; Gout; Humans; Linguistics; Male; Middle Aged; Perception; Search Engine; Young Adult"
"Essential medicines at the national level: The global asthma network’s essential asthma medicines survey 2014",2019,"Patients with asthma need uninterrupted supplies of affordable, quality-assured essential medicines. However, access in many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is limited. The World Health Organization (WHO) Non-Communicable Disease (NCD) Global Action Plan 2013–2020 sets an 80% target for essential NCD medicines’ availability. Poor access is partly due to medicines not being included on the national Essential Medicines Lists (EML) and/or National Reimbursement Lists (NRL) which guide the provision of free/subsidised medicines. We aimed to determine how many countries have essential asthma medicines on their EML and NRL, which essential asthma medicines, and whether surveys might monitor progress. A cross-sectional survey in 2013–2015 of Global Asthma Network principal investigators generated 111/120 (93%) responses—41 high-income countries and territories (HICs); 70 LMICs. Patients in HICs with NRL are best served (91% HICs included ICS (inhaled corticosteroids) and salbutamol). Patients in the 24 (34%) LMICs with no NRL and the 14 (30%) LMICs with an NRL, however no ICS are likely to have very poor access to affordable, quality-assured ICS. Many LMICs do not have essential asthma medicines on their EML or NRL. Technical guidance and advocacy for policy change is required. Improving access to these medicines will improve the health system’s capacity to address NCDs. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Neighborhood supermarket access and childhood obesity: A systematic review",2019,"Childhood obesity is one of the most pressing public health issues nowadays. The environmental factors have been identified as potential risks for obesity, as they may influence people's lifestyle behaviours. Lack of access to supermarkets that usually provide healthy food options has been found to be a risk factor for childhood obesity in several studies. However, findings remained inconclusive. We aimed to systematically review the association between access to supermarkets and childhood obesity. A literature search was conducted in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase for studies published before 1 January 2019. Twenty-four studies conducted in four countries were identified, from which data on the basic characteristics of studies and participants, measures of access to supermarkets, and associations between access to supermarkets and weight-related behaviours and outcomes were extracted. The median sample size was 1858 participants. Half of the included studies indicated a negative association, one fourth reported a positive association, and the remaining one fourth did not find a significant association. Better designed studies are necessary to achieve a robust understanding of this epidemiological relationship in the future. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Vitamin D and cardiometabolic disorders: a review of current evidence, genetic determinants and pathomechanisms",2019,"Vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in the pathophysiology of cardiometabolic disorders including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases and polycystic ovary syndrome. Despite a large number of experimental and observational studies supporting a role for vitamin D in these pathologies, randomized controlled trials have reported little to no effect of vitamin D supplementation in the prevention or treatment of these disorders, although some results remain ambiguous. Polymorphisms in genes related to vitamin D metabolism, particularly in the vitamin D receptor and binding protein and the metabolizing enzyme 1-α-hydroxylase, have emerged as potential contributors to these divergent results. It is now becoming increasingly recognized that the effects and potential benefits of vitamin D supplementation may vary by several factors including vitamin D deficiency status, ethnicity and/or the presence of genetic variants, which affect individual responses to supplementation. However, these factors have seldom been explored in the available literature. Future trials should consider inter-individual differences and, in particular, should aim to clarify whether certain subgroups of individuals may benefit from vitamin D supplementation in the context of cardiometabolic health. ? 2018 World Obesity Federation","colecalciferol; ergocalciferol; vitamin D; vitamin D receptor; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular disease; genetic variation; human; intervention study; metabolic disorder; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; observational study; ovary polycystic disease; pathophysiology; Review; vitamin D deficiency; vitamin supplementation; cardiovascular disease; complication; dietary supplement; metabolic disorder; vitamin D deficiency; Cardiovascular Diseases; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Metabolic Diseases; Vitamin D Deficiency"
"Systems Thinking and indigenous systems: native contributions to obesity prevention",2019,"Much has been written about the impact of chronic conditions on post-colonial indigenous populations. Much less, however, has been written about indigenous knowledge and how it may help tackle poor health statistics among indigenous populations. This article describes two approaches to obesity prevention that are grounded in M?tauranga M?ori (M?ori worldview), both of which challenge the “person-centred” approach so prevalent in Western approaches. These approaches were mapped using Systems Thinking tools, specifically causal loop diagrams, to test whether or not these tools could be used to “translate” indigenous approaches in a way that retained the integrity of their particular worldview and provided a tool to help those communities reflect on their practices in a way that led to new insights. Systems Thinking was found to have many overlaps with M?tauranga M?ori, and the use of system thinking tools provided mutually beneficial learning opportunities for both the researchers and the communities involved. ?

"Somatosensory and transcranial direct current stimulation effects on manual dexterity and motor cortex function: A metaplasticity study",2019,"Background: Non-invasive neuromodulation may provide treatment strategies for neurological deficits affecting movement, such as stroke. For example, weak electrical stimulation applied to the hand by wearing a “mesh glove” (MGS) can transiently increase primary motor cortex (M1) excitability. Conversely, transcranial direct current stimulation with the cathode over M1 (c-tDCS) can decrease corticomotor excitability. Objective/Hypothesis: We applied M1 c-tDCS as a priming adjuvant to MGS and hypothesised metaplastic effects would be apparent in improved motor performance and modulation of M1 inhibitory and facilitatory circuits. Methods: Sixteen right-handed neurologically healthy individuals participated in a repeated measures cross-over study; nine minutes of sham- or c-tDCS followed by 30 min of suprasensory threshold MGS. Dexterity of the non-dominant (left) hand was assessed using the grooved pegboard task, and measures of corticomotor excitability, intracortical facilitation, short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI), short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), and SAI in the presence of SICI (SAIxSICI), were obtained at baseline, post-tDCS, and 0, 30 and 60 min post-MGS. Results: There was a greater improvement in grooved pegboard completion times with c-tDCS primed MGS than sham + MGS. There was also more pronounced disinhibition of SAI. However, disinhibition of SAI in the presence of SICI was less and rest motor threshold higher compared to sham + MGS. Conclusions: The results indicate a metaplastic modulation of corticomotor excitability with c-tDCS primed MGS. Further studies are warranted to determine how various stimulation approaches can induce metaplastic effects on M1 neuronal circuits to boost functional gains obtained with motor practice. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","adult; Article; controlled study; electromyography; facilitation; female; grooved pegboard test; human; human experiment; latent period; male; motor performance; nerve cell excitability; neurophysiology; normal human; primary motor cortex; priority journal; Purdue pegboard test; right handedness; somatosensory stimulation; transcranial direct current stimulation; crossover procedure; hand; motor activity; motor cortex; motor evoked potential; movement (physiology); nerve cell inhibition; nerve cell plasticity; physiology; procedures; psychomotor performance; randomization; transcranial direct current stimulation; young adult; Adult; Cross-Over Studies; Evoked Potentials, Motor; Female; Hand; Humans; Male; Motor Activity; Motor Cortex; Movement; Neural Inhibition; Neuronal Plasticity; Psychomotor Performance; Random Allocation; Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation; Young Adult"

"3,5-Dialkoxypyridine analogues of bedaquiline are potent antituberculosis agents with minimal inhibition of the hERG channel",2019,"Bedaquiline is a new drug of the diarylquinoline class that has proven to be clinically effective against drug-resistant tuberculosis, but has a cardiac liability (prolongation of the QT interval) due to its potent inhibition of the cardiac potassium channel protein hERG. Bedaquiline is highly lipophilic and has an extremely long terminal half-life, so has the potential for more-than-desired accumulation in tissues during the relatively long treatment durations required to cure TB. The present work is part of a program that seeks to identify a diarylquinoline that is as potent as bedaquiline against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with lower lipophilicity, higher clearance, and lower risk for QT prolongation. Previous work led to the identification of compounds with greatly-reduced lipophilicity compounds that retain good anti-tubercular activity in vitro and in mouse models of TB, but has not addressed the hERG blockade. We now present compounds where the C-unit naphthalene is replaced by a 3,5-dialkoxy-4-pyridyl, demonstrate more potent in vitro and in vivo anti-tubercular activity, with greatly attenuated hERG blockade. Two examples of this series are in preclinical development. ? 2019 The Authors","3 (benzofuran 7 ylmethyl) 6 bromo 2 methoxyquinoline; 3 (benzo[d][1,3]dioxol 4 ylmethyl) 6 bromo 2 methoxyquinoline; 3 [(2,6 bis(ethylthio)pyridin 4 yl)methyl] 6 bromo 2 methoxyquinoline; 3 [(2,6 bis(methylthio)pyridin 4 yl)methyl] 6 bromo 2 methoxyquinoline; 4 [(6 bromo 2 methoxyquinolin 3 yl)methyl] 6 (ethylthio) n,n dimethylpyridin 2 amine; 4 [(6 bromo 2 methoxyquinolin 3 yl)methyl] 6 ethoxy n,n dimethylpyridin 2 amine; 4 [(6 bromo 2 methoxyquinolin 3 yl)methyl] 6 methox n,n dimethylpyridin 2 amine; 5 [(6 bromo 2 methoxyquinolin 3 yl)methyl] n,n diethylpyridin 2 amine; 6 bromo 2 methoxy 3 [(2,3,5 trimethoxypyridin 4 yl)methyl]quinolone; 6 bromo 2 methoxy 3 [(2,4,5 trimethoxypyridin 3 yl)methyl]quinolone; 6 bromo 2 methoxy 3 [(5,6,7,8 tetrahydronaphthalen 1 yl) methyl]quinolone; 6 bromo 3 (2 fluoro 3 methylbenzyl) 2 methoxyquinoline; 6 bromo 3 (3 fluoro 4 methoxybenzyl) 2 methoxyquinoline; 6 bromo 3 [(2 cyclobutoxy 6 methoxypyridin 4 yl)methyl] 2 methoxyquinoline; 6 bromo 3 [(2 ethoxy 6 isopropoxypyridin 4 yl)methyl] 2 methoxyquinoline; 6 bromo 3 [(2 isopropoxy 5 methoxypyridin 4 yl)methyl] 2 methoxyquinoline; 6 bromo 3 [(2,3 dihydro 1h inden 4 yl)methyl] 2 methoxyquinoline; 6 bromo 3 [(2,5 dimethoxypyridin 4 yl)methyl] 2 methoxyquinoline; 6 bromo 3 [(3 fluoro 2 methoxypyridin 4 yl)methyl] 2 methoxyquinoline; 6 bromo 3 [(5 isopropoxy 2 methoxypyridin 3 yl)methyl] 2 methoxyquinoline; bedaquiline; potassium channel HERG; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; area under the curve; Article; colony forming unit; controlled study; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug potency; drug structure; drug synthesis; female; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; MIC90; mouse; nonhuman; single drug dose; structure activity relation; treatment outcome; tuberculosis"
"Feasibility of describing community strengths relative to Omaha system concepts",2019,"Objectives: The purpose was to determine the feasibility of using a standardized language, the Omaha System, to describe community-level strengths. The objectives were: (a) to evaluate the feasibility of using the Omaha System at the community level to reflect community strengths and (b) to describe preliminary results of community strengths observations across international settings. Design and Sample: A descriptive qualitative design was used. The sample was a data set of 284 windshield surveys by nursing students in 5 countries: Mexico, New Zealand, Norway, Turkey, and the United States. Measures: An online survey included a checklist and open-ended questions on community strengths for 11 concepts of the Omaha System Problem Classification Scheme: Income, Sanitation, Residence, Neighborhood/workplace safety, Communication with community resources, Social contact, Interpersonal relationship, Spirituality, Nutrition, Substance use, and Health care supervision. Themes were derived through content analysis of responses to the open-ended questions. Results: Feasibility was demonstrated: Students were able to use the Omaha System terms and collect data on strengths. Common themes were described among the five countries. Conclusions: The Omaha System appears to be useful in documenting community-level strengths. Themes and exemplar quotes provide a first step in developing operational definitions of strengths at a more granular level. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","article; checklist; community assessment; content analysis; feasibility study; human; human experiment; human relation; international cooperation; language; major clinical study; Mexico; neighborhood; New Zealand; nomenclature; Norway; nursing student; nutrition; Omaha system; preliminary data; qualitative research; religion; sanitation; substance use; Turkey (republic); workplace; classification; controlled vocabulary; feasibility study; health promotion; nurse; procedures; public health; questionnaire; turkey (bird); United States; Feasibility Studies; Health Promotion; Humans; Mexico; New Zealand; Norway; Public Health; Public Health Nursing; Students, Nursing; Surveys and Questionnaires; Turkey; United States; Vocabulary, Controlled"

"Geography and patient history in long-term lipid lowering medication adherence for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease",2019,"In order to determine the role of geographical and patient history factors in long-term medication adherence in cardiovascular disease (CVD), we analysed adherence to lipid-lowering therapy in a primary care cohort based on CVD decision support and linked health systems and census data from Auckland, New Zealand. Two-year adherence was examined for 10,410 patients aged between 30 and 74 with neither diabetes nor a history of CVD. Using logistic regression we found significant variation in adherence by age, ethnicity and being a new therapy user, and in 9 of 86 geographic zones. A large low-adherence ‘cold-spot’ of 13 contiguous geographic zones was detected through local Getis-Ord Gi* analysis. A set of 42 models to predict adherence was formulated on sets of demographic, geographic and refill history factors. We observed prediction ability to be improved by addition of refill history but not geographical variables, and boosted regression tree (BRT) models outperformed logistic regression. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","antilipemic agent; adult; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; decision support system; diabetes mellitus; ethnicity; female; geography; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; medical history; medication compliance; New Zealand; patient compliance; primary medical care; primary prevention; priority journal"
"Health Consumer Usage Patterns in Management of CVD using Data Mining Techniques",2019,"The Healthcare system is exposed to the increasing impact of chronic diseases including cardiovascular diseases; it is of much importance to analyze and understand the health trajectories for efficient planning and fair allotment of resources. This work proposes an approach based on mining clinical data to support the exploration of health trajectories related to cardiovascular diseases. As the health data are highly confidential, we aimed to conduct our experiments using a large, synthetic, longitudinal dataset, constituted to represent the CVD risk factors distribution and temporal sequence of events related to heart failure hospitalization and readmission. This research work analyses and represents the temporal events or states of the patient's trajectory with the aim of understanding the patient's journey in the management of the chronic condition and its complications by using data mining techniques. This study focuses on developing an efficient algorithm to find cohesive clusters for handling the temporal events. Clustering health trajectories have been carried out by proposing an improved version of the Ant-based clustering algorithm. Insights from this study can potentially result in evidence that these approaches are useful in understanding and analyzing patient's health trajectories for better management of the chronic condition and its progression. ? 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cardiology; Clustering algorithms; Diseases; Health risks; Large dataset; Trajectories; Ant-based clustering algorithm; Cardio-vascular disease; Chronic conditions; Chronic disease; Clustering; Efficient planning; Health-care system; Temporal sequences; Data mining"
"Independent Left Ventricular Morphometric Atlases Show Consistent Relationships with Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A UK Biobank Study",2019,"Left ventricular (LV) mass and volume are important indicators of clinical and pre-clinical disease processes. However, much of the shape information present in modern imaging examinations is currently ignored. Morphometric atlases enable precise quantification of shape and function, but there has been no objective comparison of different atlases in the same cohort. We compared two independent LV atlases using MRI scans of 4547 UK Biobank participants: (i) a volume atlas derived by automatic non-rigid registration of image volumes to a common template, and (ii) a surface atlas derived from manually drawn epicardial and endocardial surface contours. The strength of associations between atlas principal components and cardiovascular risk factors (smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and angina) were quantified with logistic regression models and five-fold cross validation, using area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) metrics. Both atlases exhibited similar principal components, showed similar relationships with risk factors, and had stronger associations (higher AUC and lower AIC) than a reference model based on LV mass and volume, for all risk factors (DeLong p < 0.05). Morphometric variations associated with each risk factor could be quantified and visualized and were similar between atlases. UK Biobank LV shape atlases are robust to construction method and show stronger relationships with cardiovascular risk factors than mass and volume. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Phylodynamic Model Adequacy Using Posterior Predictive Simulations",2019,"Rapidly evolving pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, accumulate genetic change at a similar timescale over which their epidemiological processes occur, such that, it is possible to make inferences about their infectious spread using phylogenetic time-trees. For this purpose it is necessary to choose a phylodynamic model. However, the resulting inferences are contingent on whether the model adequately describes key features of the data. Model adequacy methods allow formal rejection of a model if it cannot generate the main features of the data. We present TreeModelAdequacy, a package for the popular BEAST2 software that allows assessing the adequacy of phylodynamic models. We illustrate its utility by analyzing phylogenetic trees from two viral outbreaks of Ebola and H1N1 influenza. The main features of the Ebola data were adequately described by the coalescent exponential-growth model, whereas the H1N1 influenza data were best described by the birth-death susceptible-infected-recovered model. ?

"A survey study to measure the practice of patient counselling and other community pharmacy services in Jordan",2019,"Objectives: To identify the type of services currently provided by community pharmacists and to explore the barriers for providing high-quality services within the community pharmacy sector in Jordan. Methods: Using random sampling technique, pharmacies were approached to take part in this questionnaire-based research. All the collected data were analysed using PASW ? 18.0. Correlations were studied using Pearson's correlation. Key findings: From the 714 community pharmacies that were approached, 374 pharmacists were responded to the survey 52.4%. The majority of pharmacies provided patient counselling for long-term conditions and weight management (72.5%, n?=?271 and 70.3%, n?=?263 respectively). Lack of patient interest was the main barrier for not providing pharmaceutical services according to 50.8% of pharmacists. Three-quarters of the pharmacists preferred to be given incentives for providing pharmaceutical services by government (73.3%, n?=?274). There were significant correlations between providing community pharmacy services and subspecialty of the responding pharmacists (r?=?0.142, P?&lt;?0.01), experience (r?=?0.150, P?&lt;?0.01). Concerns regarding patient adherence to medications were raised by 88% of pharmacists. There was a significant positive correlation between subspecialty and concerns about adherence (r?=??0.160, P?&lt;?0.01), on the other hand, significant negative correlation was found between years of experience and concerns about adherence (r?=??0.246, P?&lt;?0.01). Conclusions: This study provides baseline data for policymakers on what pharmaceutical services are currently available across community pharmacies in Jordan and what barriers to these services may exist. These data also give an insight into how to improve the delivery of professional services that could result in better health outcomes. ? 2018 Royal Pharmaceutical Society","adult; article; body weight; controlled study; female; government; hospital department; human; Jordan; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; outcome assessment; patient counseling; pharmacist; questionnaire; sampling"

"A randomised controlled trial of vitamin D and omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids in the treatment of irritability and hyperactivity among children with autism spectrum disorder",2019,"Irritability and hyperactivity are common in children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). Because pharmacological treatments may have adverse effects, and despite limited evidence, caregivers/parents often use dietary supplements such as vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids to address these behavioural symptoms. As a secondary objective of the VIDOMA (Vitamin D and Omega-3 in ASD) trial, we evaluated the efficacy of vitamin D, omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid [omega-3 LCPUFA; docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)], or both on irritability and hyperactivity. New Zealand children with ASD (aged 2.5–8 years) participated in a 12-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of vitamin D (2000 IU/day, VID), omega-3 LCPUFA (722 mg/day DHA, OM), or both (2000 IU/day vitamin D + 722 mg/day DHA, VIDOM). The primary outcomes were the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) domains of irritability and hyperactivity. Biomarkers (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] and omega-3 index) and primary outcomes were measured at baseline and 12-months. Out of 111 children who completed baseline data collection, 66% completed the study (VID = 19, OM = 23, VIDOM = 15, placebo = 16). After 12 months, children receiving OM (-5.0 ± 5.0, P = 0.001) and VID (-4.0±4.9, P = 0.01) had greater reduction in irritability than placebo (0.8±6.1). Compared to placebo, children on VID also had greater reduction in hyperactivity (-5.2±6.3 vs. -0.8±5.6, P = 0.047). Serum 25(OH)D concentration (nmol/L, mean±SD) increased by 27±14 in VID and by 36±17 in VIDOM groups (P < 0.0001), and omega-3 index (%, median (25th, 75th percentiles)) by 4.4 (3.3, 5.9) in OM and by 4.0 (2.0, 6.0) in VIDOM groups (P < 0.0001), indicating a good compliance rate. The results indicate that vitamin D and omega-3 LCPUFA reduced irritability symptoms in children with ASD.

"Crystalline adduct of moxifloxacin with trans-cinnamic acid to reduce the aqueous solubility and dissolution rate for improved residence time in the lungs",2019,"A crystalline adduct of the anti-tubercular drug, moxifloxacin and trans-cinnamic acid (1:1 molar ratio (MCA1:1)) was prepared to prolong the residence time of the drug in the lungs by reducing its solubility and dissolution rate. Whether the adduct is a salt or cocrystal has not been unequivocally determined. Equilibrium solubility and intrinsic dissolution rate measurements for the adduct (MCA1:1) in phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) revealed a significant decrease in the solubility of moxifloxacin (from 17.68 ± 0.85 mg mL?1 to 6.10 ± 0.05 mg mL?1) and intrinsic dissolution rate (from 0.47 ± 0.04 mg cm?2 min?1 to 0.14 ± 0.03 mg cm?2 min?1) compared to the supplied moxifloxacin. The aerosolization behaviour of the adduct from an inhaler device, Aerolizer?, using a Next Generation Impactor showed a fine particle fraction of 30.4 ± 1.2%. The dissolution behaviour of the fine particle dose of respirable particles collected was assessed in a small volume of stationary mucus fluid using a custom-made dissolution apparatus. The respirable adduct particles showed a lower dissolution (microscopic observation) and permeation compared to the supplied moxifloxacin. The crystalline adduct MCA1:1 has a lower solubility and dissolution rate than moxifloxacin and could improve the local residence time and therapeutic action of moxifloxacin in the lungs. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","cinnamic acid; moxifloxacin; phosphate; sodium chloride; cinnamic acid; cinnamic acid derivative; moxifloxacin; tuberculostatic agent; aerosol; aqueous solution; Article; comparative study; controlled study; crystal structure; dissolution; drug delivery system; drug solubility; high performance liquid chromatography; hydrogen bond; in vitro study; limit of detection; lung; lung alveolus macrophage; particle size; priority journal; protonation; retention time; scanning electron microscopy; thermogravimetry; chemistry; crystallization; drug effect; lung; permeability; procedures; solubility; Antitubercular Agents; Cinnamates; Crystallization; Lung; Moxifloxacin; Permeability; Solubility"

"GH replacement titrated to serum IGF-1 does not reduce concentrations of myostatin in blood or skeletal muscle",2019,"Objective: Traditional weight-based regimens of GH replacement are more effective at reversing the loss of skeletal muscle in GH-deficient adults than currently recommended regimens, where the dose of GH is increased to restore serum concentrations of IGF-1. While weight-based regimens increase concentrations of IGF-1 and decrease concentrations of myostatin, it is not known whether the reduced effectiveness of individually titrated GH regimens is due to ongoing hypersecretion of myostatin. Consequently, the aims of this study were to determine whether concentrations of myostatin in blood and skeletal muscle are increased in GH-deficient adults, and whether these concentrations are decreased by GH replacement regimens titrated to restore serum IGF-1. Design: Twenty-six GH deficient adults (18 men and 8 women) were treated with individualised regimens of recombinant human GH aiming to achieve serum concentrations of IGF-1 within one standard deviation of the age- and gender-adjusted mean. Plasma concentrations of myostatin were measured at baseline and after 6 months of treatment were compared to fifteen healthy controls (9 men and 6 women). Skeletal muscle biopsies were performed in 19 of these GH-deficient adults (15 men and 4 women) and 10 of the healthy controls (6 men and 4 women). Expression of IGF-1 and myostatin mRNA was determined by qPCR. Results: Concentrations of IGF-1 in serum and mRNA in skeletal muscle were reduced, and concentrations of myostatin in plasma and mRNA in skeletal muscle were increased in GH-deficient adults at baseline (P <.05 versus healthy controls). Despite restoring concentrations of IGF-1, GH replacement did not reduce concentrations of myostatin in either blood or skeletal muscle. Concentrations of IGF-1 and myostatin in both blood and skeletal muscle were positively correlated in GH-deficient adults at baseline (P <.05), but not in GH-replete adults. Conclusions: Concentrations of myostatin in blood and skeletal muscle are increased in GH-deficient adults. Despite normalising concentrations of IGF-1, individualised regimens of GH replacement do not reduce concentrations of myostatin in blood or skeletal muscle. Ongoing hypersecretion of myostatin may explain why individually titrated GH replacement regimens are less effective than higher weight-based regimens in increasing skeletal muscle mass. ? 2018","ethinylestradiol plus levonorgestrel; hydrocortisone; levothyroxine; myostatin; recombinant growth hormone; somatomedin C; testosterone; human growth hormone; IGF1 protein, human; myostatin; somatomedin C; adrenal insufficiency; adult; age distribution; Article; clinical article; controlled study; female; growth hormone deficiency; hormone substitution; human; human tissue; hypogonadism; hypothyroidism; male; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; sex difference; skeletal muscle; tissue level; blood; case control study; growth disorder; metabolism; middle aged; skeletal muscle; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Growth Disorders; Human Growth Hormone; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Myostatin"

"Detection of smoking status from retinal images; a Convolutional Neural Network study",2019,"Cardiovascular diseases are directly linked to smoking habits, which has both physiological and anatomical effects on the systemic and retinal circulations, and these changes can be detected with fundus photographs. Here, we aimed to 1- design a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), using retinal photographs, to differentiate between smokers and non-smokers; and 2- use the attention maps to better understand the physiological changes that occur in the retina in smokers. 165,104 retinal images were obtained from a diabetes screening programme, labelled with self-reported “smoking” or “non-smoking” status. The images were pre-processed in one of two ways, either “contrast-enhanced” or “skeletonized”. Experiments were run on an Intel Xeon Gold 6128 CPU @ 3.40 GHz with 16 GB of RAM memory and a NVIDIA GeForce TiTan V VOLTA 12 GB, for 20 epochs. The dataset was split 80/20 for training and testing sets, respectively. The overall validation outcomes for the contrast-enhanced model were accuracy 88.88%, specificity 93.87%. In contrast, the outcomes of the skeletonized model were accuracy 63.63%, specificity 65.60%. The “attention maps” that were generated of the contrast-enhanced model highlighted the retinal vasculature, perivascular region and the fovea most prominently. We trained a customized CNN to accurately determine smoking status. The retinal vasculature, the perivascular region and the fovea appear to be important predictive features in the determination of smoking status. Despite a high degree of accuracy, the sensitivity of our CNN was low. Further research is required to establish whether the frequency, duration, and dosage (quantity) of smoking would improve the sensitivity of the CNN. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Global, regional, and national burden of suicide mortality 1990 to 2016: Systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016",2019,"Objectives To use the estimates from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2016 to describe patterns of suicide mortality globally, regionally, and for 195 countries and territories by age, sex, and Socio-demographic index, and to describe temporal trends between 1990 and 2016. Design Systematic analysis. Main outcome measures Crude and age standardised rates from suicide mortality and years of life lost were compared across regions and countries, and by age, sex, and Socio-demographic index (a composite measure of fertility, income, and education). Results The total number of deaths from suicide increased by 6.7% (95% uncertainty interval 0.4% to 15.6%) globally over the 27 year study period to 817 000 (762 000 to 884 000) deaths in 2016. However, the age standardised mortality rate for suicide decreased by 32.7% (27.2% to 36.6%) worldwide between 1990 and 2016, similar to the decline in the global age standardised mortality rate of 30.6%. Suicide was the leading cause of age standardised years of life lost in the Global Burden of Disease region of high income Asia Pacific and was among the top 10 leading causes in eastern Europe, central Europe, western Europe, central Asia, Australasia, southern Latin America, and high income North America. Rates for men were higher than for women across regions, countries, and age groups, except for the 15 to 19 age group. There was variation in the female to male ratio, with higher ratios at lower levels of Socio-demographic index. Women experienced greater decreases in mortality rates (49.0%, 95% uncertainty interval 42.6% to 54.6%) than men (23.8%, 15.6% to 32.7%). Conclusions Age standardised mortality rates for suicide have greatly reduced since 1990, but suicide remains an important contributor to mortality worldwide. Suicide mortality was variable across locations, between sexes, and between age groups. Suicide prevention strategies can be targeted towards vulnerable populations if they are informed by variations in mortality rates. ?

"Prime minister for a day: Children’s views on junk food marketing and what to do about it",2019,"AIMS: This study explored children’s awareness of and engagement with food marketing, and their views on action to address it. METHODS: A purposeful sample of 33 children (11-13 years) from the Wellington region of New Zealand were interviewed. RESULTS: Children were knowledgeable about food marketing, although most were not aware of the extent to which they were exposed. Children did not distinguish ‘marketing to children’ from other marketing. According to the children, they were frequently exposed to food marketing, and persuaded, against their better judgement, to purchase food they knew to be harmful to their health. As many children recognised the unhealthy nature of the food marketed to them, they agreed they would take action to reduce junk food marketing if they were Prime Minister for a day. Interventions included making food marketing honest, providing nutrition information, removing billboards and increasing the promotion of healthy food. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest children’s exposure to junk food marketing may cause them physical, mental and moral harm, in direct contradiction of the New Zealand self-regulatory code for marketing. The children’s views align with the World Health Assembly’s recent decision to endorse initiatives to end childhood obesity, including restricting marketing of unhealthy foods. ?

"Physical activity and sedentary activity: Population epidemiology and concordance in Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents",2019,"Objectives To describe the epidemiology and parent-child concordance of objectively measured physical activity in a population-based sample of Australian parent-child dyads. Design Cross-sectional study (Child Health CheckPoint) nested within the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Setting Assessment centres in seven Australian cities and eight regional towns or home visits; February 2015-March 2016. Participants Of all CheckPoint families (n=1874), 1261 children (50% girls) and 1358 parent (88% mothers) provided objectively measured activity data, comprising 1077 parent-child dyads. Outcome measures Activity behaviour was assessed by GENEActiv accelerometer. Duration of moderateto-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) and vigorous physical activity and sedentary behaviour (SB) were derived using Cobra custom software, along with MVPA/SB fragmentation and mean daily activity. Pearson's correlation coefficients and linear regression estimated parent-child concordance. Survey weights and methods accounted for the complex sample design and clustering. Results Although parents had average lower accelerometry counts than children (mean [SD] 209 [46] vs 284 [71] g.min), 93% of parents met MVPA daily duration guidelines on published cutpoints (mean [SD] 125 [63] min/day MVPA), compared with only 15% of children (mean 32 [27] min). Parents showed less daily SB duration (parents: 540 [101], children: 681 [69] minutes) and less fragmented accumulation of MVPA (parents: α=1.85, children: α=2.00). Parent-child correlation coefficients were 0.16 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.22) for MVPA duration, 0.10 (95% CI 0.04 to 0.16) for MVPA fragmentation, 0.16 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.22) for SB duration and 0.18 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.23) for SB fragmentation. Conclusions Standardised cutpoints are needed for objective activity measures to inform activity guidelines across the lifecourse. This may reflect large amounts of time in non-shared environments (school and work). ? 2019 Author(s).","accelerometry; adult; Article; Australia; child; child behavior; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; major clinical study; male; parent; physical activity; practice guideline; reference value; school child; sedentary lifestyle"
"Anal fistula plug versus surgeon’s preference for surgery for trans-sphincteric anal fistula: The FIAT RCT",2019,"Background: The aim of fistula surgery is to eradicate the disease while preserving anal sphincter function. The efficacy of the Surgisis? anal fistula plug (Cook Medical, Bloomington, IN, USA) in the treatment of trans-sphincteric fistula-in-ano has been variably reported. Objectives: To undertake a randomised comparison of the safety and efficacy of the Surgisis anal fistula plug in comparison with surgeon’s preference for the treatment of trans-sphincteric anal fistulas. Design: A randomised, unblinded, parallel-arm, prospective, multicentre clinical trial. Setting: Hospitals in the UK NHS involving colorectal surgeons accredited by the Association of Coloproctology of Great Britain and Ireland. Participants: Adult patients suffering from trans-sphincteric fistula-in-ano of cryptoglandular origin. Interventions: Patients were randomised on a 1: 1 basis to either the fistula plug or the surgeon’s preference [e.g. fistulotomy, cutting seton, advancement flap or ligation of intersphincteric fistula tract (LIFT) procedure]. Main outcome measures: The primary outcome measure was quality of life as measured by the Faecal Incontinence Quality of Life (FIQoL) questionnaire at 12-month follow-up. Secondary outcome measures included clinical and radiological fistula healing rates, faecal incontinence rates, complications rates, reintervention rates and cost-effectiveness. Results: Between May 2011 and March 2016, 304 participants were recruited (152 fistula plug vs. 152 surgeon’s preference). No difference in FIQoL score between the two trial groups was seen at the 6-week, 6-month or 12-month follow-up. Clinical evidence of fistula healing was reported in 66 of 122 (54%) participants in the fistula plug group and in 66 of 119 (55%) participants in the surgeon’s preference group at 12 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed fistula healing in 54 of 110 (49%) participants in the fistula plug group and in 63 of 112 (56%) participants in the surgeon’s preference group. Variation in 12-month clinical healing rates was observed: 55%, 64%, 75%, 53% and 42% for fistula plug, cutting seton, fistulotomy, advancement flap and LIFT procedure, respectively. Faecal incontinence rates were low at baseline, with small improvement in both groups post treatment. Complications and reinterventions were frequent. The mean total costs were ?2738 [standard deviation (SD) ?1151] in the fistula plug group and ?2308 (SD ?1228) in the surgeon’s preference group. The average total quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gain was much smaller in the fistula plug group (0.829, SD 0.174) than in the surgeon’s preference group (0.790, SD 0.212). Using multiple imputation and probabilistic sensitivity analysis, and adjusting for differences in baseline EuroQol-5 Dimensions, three-level version utility, there was a 35–45% chance that the fistula plug wasascost-effectiveassurgeon’s preference over a range of thresholds of willingness to pay for a single QALY of ?20,000–30,000. Limitations: Limitations include a smaller sample size than originally calculated, a lack of blinding that perhaps biased patient-reported outcomes and a lower compliance rate with MRI at 12-month follow-up. Conclusions: The Surgisis anal fistula plug is associated with similar FIQoL score to surgeon’s preference at 12-month follow-up. The higher costs and highly uncertain and small gains in QALYs associated with the fistula plug mean that this technology is unlikely to be considered a cost-effective use of resources in the UK NHS. Future work: Further in-depth analysis should consider the clinical and MRI characteristics of fistula-in-ano in an attempt to identify predictors of fistula response to treatment. ?

"Protect-me: A parallel-group, triple blinded, placebo-controlled randomised clinical trial protocol assessing antenatal maternal melatonin supplementation for fetal neuroprotection in early-onset fetal growth restriction",2019,"Introduction Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is a serious pregnancy complication, associated with increased rates of perinatal death and morbidity among survivors. Most commonly FGR results from placental insufficiency, where the placenta fails to deliver the oxygen and nutrients required for normal fetal growth. This leads to fetal oxidative stress, resulting in organ damage through lipid peroxidation. The early developing brain is particularly susceptible, such that FGR is associated with poorer neurodevelopment, witnessed as cognitive and behavioural dysfunction, and cerebral palsy. Promisingly, melatonin, a lipid soluble antioxidant is neuroprotective in animal models of FGR. We present a protocol outlining a randomised, placebo-controlled trial to explore whether antenatal maternal melatonin supplementation in pregnancies with severe, early-onset FGR can improve neurodevelopment among survivors at 2 years of age. Methods and analyses We will recruit 336 women with a singleton pregnancy complicated by FGR between 23+0 and 31+6 weeks gestation. Participants will be randomised, stratified by gestational age, to either 30 mg melatonin per day or a visually identical placebo, continued until birth. Measures of maternal and fetal health will be collected until birth. Timing of birth will be determined by the treating clinical team in discussion with the woman. Neonatal and infant neurodevelopmental assessments will be undertaken, consisting of brain MRI at term corrected age, general movements assessment at term and 3 months' corrected age, and Bayley Scales of Infant & Toddler Development-III and Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment at 2.5 years corrected age. Analyses will be on intention to treat. The primary outcome is a difference of 5 points in the cognitive domain of the Bayley-III. Secondary outcomes address maternal and fetal safety. Ethics and dissemination This trial has Monash Health Human Research and Ethics committee approval (17-0000-583A). Findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications, conference presentations and to participants. ? 2019 BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","melatonin; placebo; Article; Bayley Scales of Infant Development; clinical outcome; clinical trial protocol; controlled study; drug safety; female; fetal well being; gestational age; human; infant toddler social emotional assessment; intrauterine growth retardation; major clinical study; multicenter study; neuroprotection; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parallel design; phase 2 clinical trial; pregnancy; pregnant woman; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; survivor; treatment outcome; triple blind procedure"
"Mental health problems, history of drug use, and violent offending are associated with increased suicide risk in imprisoned females",2019,"Background: In western countries, imprisoned females are at high risk for suicide, but the risk in Chinese imprisoned females has not been well established. The aim of this study was to clarify the suicide risk and its correlates among imprisoned females in China. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, subjects were recruited from the Female Prison of Hunan province, China. A standardized questionnaire was used to collect socio-demographic and criminological data. The Suicidality module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) 5.0 and 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) were used to assess suicide risk and mental health problems, respectively. Ordinal logistic regressions were used to identify independent factors associated with increased suicide risk. Results: A total of 2,709 imprisoned females completed the survey questionnaire. Twenty percent were rated as presenting suicide risk. Mental health problems [odds ratio (OR) = 1.21, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.00-1.47], self-reported help-seeking for mental health problems (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.11-2.56), violent offending (OR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.37-2.09), history of drug use (OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.15-1.84), family history of mental disorders (OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.10-2.23), marital status (OR = 1.29, 95% CI = 1.05-1.58), and low educational level (OR = 1.36, 95% CI = 1.11-1.67) were independently associated with increased suicide risk. Conclusion: One fifth of the imprisoned females are at risk for suicide. This study highlights the importance of assessing mental health status for suicide prevention among female prisoners. ? 2007-2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Association Between Early Life Weight Gain and Abdominal Fat Partitioning at 4.5?Years is Sex, Ethnicity, and Age Dependent",2019,"Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the independent associations between age-specific annual weight gain from birth to age 4?years and fat deposition in metabolically distinct compartments at age 4.5?years in a South Asian longitudinal birth cohort. Methods: Volumetric abdominal magnetic resonance imaging with comprehensive segmentation of deep and superficial subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissues (VAT) was performed in 316 children (150 boys and 166 girls in three ethnic groups; 158 Chinese, 94 Malay, and 64 Indian) aged 4.5?years. Associations between fat volumes and annual relative weight gain conditional on past growth were assessed overall and stratified by sex and ethnicity. Results: Conditional relative weight gain had stronger associations with greater SAT and VAT at age 4.5?years in girls than boys and in Indians compared with Malay and Chinese. Overall, the magnitude of association was the largest during 2 to 3?years for SAT and 1 to 2?years for VAT. Despite similar body weight, Indian children and girls had the highest deep and superficial SAT volumes at age 4.5?years (all interactions P?<?0.05). No significant sex or ethnic differences were observed in VAT. With increasing BMI, Indian children had the highest tendency to accumulate VAT, and girls accumulated more fat than boys in all depots (all interactions P?<?0.001). Conclusions: Indian ethnicity and female sex predisposed children to accumulate more fat in the VAT depot with increasing conditional relative weight gain in the second year of life. Thus, 1 to 2?years of age may be a critical window for interventions to reduce visceral fat accumulation. ? 2019 The Obesity Society","age; article; body mass; body weight gain; child; cohort analysis; controlled study; ethnic difference; ethnic group; ethnicity; female; girl; human; human tissue; Indian; intra-abdominal fat; lipid storage; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; preschool child; subcutaneous fat; abdominal fat; age; body weight gain; infant; newborn; pathophysiology; physiology; sex factor; Abdominal Fat; Age Factors; Child, Preschool; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Sex Factors; Weight Gain"
"Navigating double marginalisation: migrant Chinese sexual and gender minority young people’s views on mental health challenges and supports",2019,"Sexual and/or gender minority young people who are also members of an ethnic minority can experience unique challenges. Limited research draws directly on the mental health experiences of these ‘double minority’ youth. This study focused on Chinese sexual/gender minority youth in New Zealand. It sought to explore features they found challenging for, or supportive of, their mental health and wellbeing. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 Chinese sexual/gender minority participants aged between 19 and 29 years old and residing in Auckland, New Zealand. An inductive approach to qualitative data analysis was used. Two major domains of findings emerged. Firstly, participants described mental health challenges linked to racism, sexism, cis-heteronormativity and challenges in relation to intersecting identities. Secondly, Chinese culture and community connections, family and peer support and role models seemed to facilitate resiliency. However, the fear of ‘losing face’, unwillingness to disclose distress when unwell and mental health service providers’ lack of cultural and linguistic competency were described as barriers to effective mental health support. In conclusion, Chinese and sexual/gender minority identities were integral parts of participants’ sense of self, and this was associated with their mental health and wellbeing. Further research is required to explore ways to reduce barriers and promote resiliency. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",""
"Minimal medical imaging can accurately reconstruct geometric bone models for musculoskeletal models",2019,"Accurate representation of subject-specific bone anatomy in lower-limb musculoskeletal models is important for human movement analyses and simulations. Mathematical methods can reconstruct geometric bone models using incomplete imaging of bone by morphing bone model templates, but the validity of these methods has not been fully explored. The purpose of this study was to determine the minimal imaging requirements for accurate reconstruction of geometric bone models. Complete geometric pelvis and femur models of 14 healthy adults were reconstructed from magnetic resonance imaging through segmentation. From each complete bone segmentation, three sets of incomplete segmentations (set 1 being the most incomplete) were created to test the effect of imaging incompleteness on reconstruction accuracy. Geometric bone models were reconstructed from complete sets, three incomplete sets, and two motion capture-based methods. Reconstructions from (in) complete sets were generated using statistical shape modelling, followed by host-mesh and local-mesh fitting through the Musculoskeletal Atlas Project Client. Reconstructions from motion capture-based methods used positional data from skin surface markers placed atop anatomic landmarks and estimated joint centre locations as target points for statistical shape modelling and linear scaling. Accuracy was evaluated with distance error (mm) and overlapping volume similarity (%) between complete bone segmentation and reconstructed bone models, and statistically compared using a repeated measure analysis of variance (p<0.05). Motion capture-based methods produced significantly higher distance error than reconstructions from (in)complete sets. Pelvis volume similarity reduced significantly with the level of incompleteness: complete set (92.70±1.92%), set 3 (85.41±1.99%), set 2 (81.22 ±3.03%), set 1 (62.30±6.17%), motion capture-based statistical shape modelling (41.18 ±9.54%), and motion capture-based linear scaling (26.80±7.19%). A similar trend was observed for femur volume similarity. Results indicate that imaging two relevant bone regions produces overlapping volume similarity >80% compared to complete segmented bone models, and improve analyses and simulation over current standard practice of linear scaling musculoskeletal models. ? 2019 Suwarganda et al.

"Development and validation of the Health Visual Information Preference Scale",2019,"Objective: Patients are likely to have individual preferences for learning about health, which may influence their comprehension and utilization of health information. Some patients may prefer visual health information, which can make complex health information easier to understand. Aligning health information presentation with preferences may increase understanding and improve health outcomes, yet no scale measures preferences for visual health information. Design: Two studies examined the psychometric properties of the Health Visual Information Preference Scale (Health VIPS), a new measure designed to assess preferences for visual health information. Methods: In Study 1, 103 undergraduate students and 97 patients undergoing colorectal and gynaecological oncology surgery completed the Health VIPS. Exploratory factor analyses (EFA) were conducted for both samples. Internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and validity were assessed in the student sample. In Study 2, 196 outpatients completed the Health VIPS. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was performed on this sample, in addition to measures of reliability and validity. Results: In Study 1, EFA analysis suggested a two-factor structure. The Health VIPS demonstrated good internal consistency in both the student sample (α?=.70–.80) and patient sample (α?=.80), and good test–retest reliability in the student sample (r?=.63, p?<.001). Convergent validity and discriminant validity were also established. In Study 2, the CFA confirmed a two-factor structure is the best model fit for the Health VIPS. The Health VIPS also demonstrated discriminant and convergent validity. Scale item means in all samples were positively skewed, suggesting a general preference for visual health information. Conclusions: Initial evidence suggests the Health VIPS has good psychometric properties. This scale could identify patients who would benefit from additional visual aids when receiving health information. Statement of contribution What is already known on this subject? Poor comprehension of health information can lead to misunderstandings of illness and treatment, and potentially non-adherence. It is likely that patients have distinct preferences for how they would choose to receive health information, including information format. Visual health information is becoming more widely used to communicate information about health and illness to patients, although there is no measure to identify those who prefer this information format to standard written health materials. What does this study add? This study describes the first scale to assess preferences for visual health information. This scale could identify patients who would benefit from supplementary visual information in consultations. ? 2019 The British Psychological Society","adult; factor analysis; female; health status; human; male; medical information system; psychology; psychometry; reproducibility; student; validation study; Adult; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Health Information Systems; Health Status; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Students"
"A Survey of People with Lived Experience of Suicide-Related Behavior in Queensland, Australia: Their Experiences with Available Resources",2019,"Background: Many organizations provide support to people affected by suicide-related behavior, for example, those bereaved by suicide, those who have attempted suicide, and their informal carers. However, evidence regarding how well used, and acceptable, these resources are is lacking. Aims: To investigate the views about and experiences with support and resources of people with lived experience of suicide bereavement, suicide attempt, or caring. Method: The study was conducted in Queensland, Australia. In total, 175 people completed the survey. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 22. Results: Participants found resources helpful and user-friendly, but many had never searched for support, did not know it was available, or felt no better after using it. Respondents who had attempted suicide were more likely to look for resources, but less likely to feel better after using them and endorsed more barriers to accessing support. Limitations: This study used a convenience sample of individuals living in Queensland, was biased toward help-seeking populations, and included mostly women, and therefore it was not representative. Conclusion: Support and resources that are more flexible and accessible, and are offered in a more proactive manner could improve the user experiences of people affected by suicide-related behavior. ? 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.",""

"Type 1 Muscle Fiber Hypertrophy after Blood Flow-restricted Training in Powerlifters",2019,"Purpose To investigate the effects of blood flow-restricted resistance exercise (BFRRE) on myofiber areas (MFA), number of myonuclei and satellite cells (SC), muscle size and strength in powerlifters. Methods Seventeen national level powerlifters (25 ± 6 yr [mean ± SD], 15 men) were randomly assigned to either a BFRRE group (n = 9) performing two blocks (weeks 1 and 3) of five BFRRE front squat sessions within a 6.5-wk training period, or a conventional training group (Con; n = 8) performing front squats at 60%-85% of one-repetition maximum (1RM). The BFRRE consisted of four sets (first and last set to voluntary failure) at 30% of 1RM. Muscle biopsies were obtained from m. vastus lateralis (VL) and analyzed for MFA, myonuclei, SC and capillaries. Cross-sectional areas (CSA) of VL and m. rectus femoris were measured by ultrasonography. Strength was evaluated by maximal voluntary isokinetic torque (MVIT) in knee extension and 1RM in front squat. Results BFRRE induced selective increases in type I MFA (BFRRE: 12% vs Con: 0%, P < 0.01) and myonuclear number (BFRRE: 18% vs Con: 0%, P = 0.02). Type II MFA was unaltered in both groups. BFRRE induced greater changes in VL CSA (7.7% vs 0.5%, P = 0.04), which correlated with the increases in MFA of type I fibers (r = 0.81, P = 0.02). No group differences were observed in SC and strength changes, although MVIT increased with BFRRE (P = 0.04), whereas 1RM increased in Con (P = 0.02). Conclusions Two blocks of low-load BFRRE in the front squat exercise resulted in increased quadriceps CSA associated with preferential hypertrophy and myonuclear addition in type 1 fibers of national level powerlifters.

"Efficacy and safety during extended treatment of lesinurad in combination with febuxostat in patients with tophaceous gout: CRYSTAL extension study",2019,"Background: In gout, long-term urate-lowering therapy (ULT) promotes dissolution of tissue urate crystal deposits. However, no studies using combined xanthine oxidase inhibition and uricosuric ULT have focused on clinical outcomes or adverse events (AEs) beyond 12 months of therapy. Our objective in the present study was to examine efficacy and long-term safety in patients with tophaceous gout receiving febuxostat plus lesinurad as combination therapy. Methods: Patients receiving combined lesinurad and febuxostat in the 12-month core CRYSTAL study continued at the same doses in the extension study (""200CONT"", ""400CONT""), whereas those receiving only febuxostat 80 mg were randomized to lesinurad 200 or 400 mg with febuxostat (""200CROSS"", ""400CROSS""). The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients experiencing complete resolution (CR) of at least one target tophus by extension month (EM) 12. The key secondary endpoint was mean rate of gout flares requiring treatment from the end of EM 2 to the end of EM 12. Secondary endpoints included reduction in the sum of areas for all target tophi. Safety assessments included AEs and laboratory data for the entire extension study (median length of lesinurad exposure, 800 days). Results: Of 235 patients completing the core study, 196 (83.4%) enrolled in the extension: 200CONT (n = 64), 200CROSS (n = 33), 400CONT (n = 65), and 400CROSS (n = 34). At EM 12, 59.6%, 43.5%, 66.7%, and 50.0% of patients, respectively, had CR of at least one target tophus. The sum of areas for all target tophi was reduced by 76.4%, 58.1%, 77.5%, and 62.8%, respectively. The adjusted mean (SE) rates of gout flares requiring treatment from the end of EM 2 to the end of EM 12 were 0.6 (0.19), 1.3 (0.48), 0.2 (0.08), and 1.9 (0.93), respectively. Target sUA < 5.0 mg/dl was achieved by 77.1%, 79.2%, 88.5%, and 71.4% of patients, respectively. Exposure-adjusted incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and renal-related TEAEs in the core study were not increased with prolonged lesinurad exposure in the extension study. Conclusions: Patients receiving lesinurad plus febuxostat therapy for 2 years continued to be at sUA target. Patients exhibited a progressive increase in CR of at least one target tophus, progressive reduction in tophus size, and reduction of gout flares requiring treatment over the second year, with AEs consistent with those observed in the core study.

"Bone-Bound Bisphosphonates Inhibit Proliferation of Breast Cancer Cells",2019,"Bisphosphonates are used in treating patients with breast cancer. In vitro studies have shown that bisphosphonates act directly on tumour cells, inhibiting cell proliferation and inducing apoptosis. In most such studies, drugs were added to culture media exposing cells to high bisphosphonate concentrations in solution. However, since bisphosphonates bind to bone hydroxyapatite with high affinity and remain bound for very long periods of time, these experimental systems are not an optimal model for the action of the drugs in vivo. The aim of this study was to determine whether bone-bound zoledronate has direct effects on adjacent breast cancer cells. Bone slices were pre-incubated with bisphosphonate solutions, washed, and seeded with cells of the breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 or MDA-MB-231. Proliferation was assessed by cell counts and thymidine incorporation for up to 72?h. Inhibition of the mevalonate pathway was tested by measuring the levels of unprenylated Rap1A, and apoptosis was examined by the presence of cleaved caspase-8 on western blots. The proliferation rate of breast cancer cells on zoledronate-treated bone was significantly lower compared to cells on control bone. Other bisphosphonates showed a similar inhibitory effect, with an order of potency similar to their clinical potencies. Unprenylated Rap1A accumulated in MCF7 cells on zoledronate-treated bone, suggesting zoledronate acted through the inhibition of the mevalonate pathway. Accumulation of cleaved caspase-8 in MDA-MB-231 cells on bisphosphonate-treated bone indicated increased apoptosis in the cells. In conclusion, bone-bound zoledronate inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation, an activity that may contribute to its clinical anti-tumour effects. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","caspase 8; mevalonic acid; zoledronic acid; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; bone slice; bovine; breast cancer; cell count; cell proliferation; controlled study; DNA synthesis; human; human cell; human cell culture; MCF-7 cell line; MDA-MB-231 cell line; nonhuman; priority journal; Western blotting"
"Exploring trade-offs between staffing levels and turnaround time in a pathology laboratory using discrete event simulation",2019,"Many health delivery services have required performance targets. Typically, these targets are presented as percentiles of patients to be seen within specified timeframes. These targets present hospital administrators with a resourcing problem complicated by conflicting objectives: How to minimize costs while maximizing throughput to achieve the performance targets? In this paper, we describe the use of a simulation model to evaluate the effect of changes to staff levels in a cytology department, investigating the trade-off between staff levels and turnaround times in light of performance targets specified by government. Standard practice for determining staffing levels in a cytology department uses average workload estimates and does not take into account target performance measures, task variability, and the interruptive nature of the workload of pathologists. We develop a simulation model for pathologist workload within a cytology department in New Zealand. We describe the model construction process that follows the hierarchical control conceptual modeling (HCCM) framework. We use the resulting simulation model to examine the trade-offs between staffing levels (and associated rosters) and task turnaround time. The results indicate that consideration of variation in task arrivals is important when considering the effect of staffing levels on turnaround time. Furthermore, as the cytology department is required to meet performance targets that involve maximum service times for a percentile of patients, such an approach is necessary in order to estimate the performance level of a staffing roster. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","cytology; government; laboratory method; modeling; pathology; planning process; simulation; trade-off; adult; article; cytology; government; human; New Zealand; pathologist; simulation; staff; turnaround time; workload; hospital department; nonbiological model; organization and management; theoretical model; New Zealand; Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Models, Organizational; Models, Theoretical; New Zealand; Pathology Department, Hospital; Workforce; Workload"
"Partial remission in type 1 diabetes and associated factors: Analysis based on the insulin dose-adjusted hemoglobin A1c in children and adolescents from a regional diabetes center, Auckland, New Zealand",2019,"Background: Partial remission (PREM) by the insulin dose-adjusted HbA1c (IDAA1c) method has not been evaluated for the combined associations of ethnicity and socioeconomic status in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Objective: To investigate prevalence and predictors of PREM defined by IDAA1c. Methods: Six hundred fourteen of 678 children (aged <15 years) with new-onset T1D (2000-2013) from a regional pediatric diabetes service (Auckland, New Zealand). Results: Overall rate of PREM at 3 months was 42.4%, and lower in M?ori/Pacific children (28.6%; P =.006) and those of other ethnicities (28.8%; P =.030) compared with New Zealand Europeans (50.4%). Comparing the most and least deprived socioeconomic quintiles, the odds of PREM were lower among the most deprived (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.44; P =.019). Lower rates of PREM were seen in children aged 0 to 4.9 years (23.8%) and 10 to 14 years (40.9%) than in children aged 5 to 9.9 years (57.4%; P <.05). Further predictors of lower rates of PREM were ketoacidosis at diagnosis (aOR 0.54 with DKA; P =.002) and diabetes duration (aOR 0.84 per month; P <.0001). Patient's sex, body mass index standard deviation score, or autoantibodies were not associated with PREM. PREM at 3 months was associated with lower HbA1c over 18 months compared with children not in PREM (65.0 vs 71.3 mmol/mol; P <.0001), independent of ketoacidosis.

"Pyrazolo[1,5- a]pyridine Inhibitor of the Respiratory Cytochrome bcc Complex for the Treatment of Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis",2019,"Respiration is a promising target for the development of new antimycobacterial agents, with a growing number of compounds in clinical development entering this target space. However, more candidate inhibitors are needed to expand the therapeutic options available for drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. Here, we characterize a putative respiratory complex III (QcrB) inhibitor, TB47: a pyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridine-3-carboxamide. TB47 is active (MIC between 0.016 and 0.500 μg/mL) against a panel of 56 M. tuberculosis clinical isolates, including 37 multi-drug-resistant and two extensively drug-resistant strains. Pharmacokinetic and toxicity studies showed promising profiles, including negligible CYP450 interactions, cytotoxicity, and hERG channel inhibition. Consistent with other reported QcrB inhibitors, TB47 inhibits oxygen consumption only when the alternative oxidase, cytochrome bd, is deleted. A point mutation in the qcrB cd2-loop (H190Y, M. smegmatis numbering) rescues the inhibitory effects of TB47. Metabolomic profiling of TB47-treated M. tuberculosis H37Rv cultures revealed accumulation of steps in the TCA cycle and pentose phosphate pathway that are linked to reducing equivalents, suggesting that TB47 causes metabolic redox stress. In mouse infection models, a TB47 monotherapy was not bactericidal. However, TB47 was strongly synergistic with pyrazinamide and rifampicin, suggesting a promising role in combination therapies. We propose that TB47 is an effective lead compound for the development of novel tuberculosis chemotherapies. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","cytochrome; cytochrome bcc; cytochrome P450; potassium channel HERG; pyrazinamide; pyrazolo[1,5 a]pyridine inhibitor; pyridine derivative; rifampicin; tb 47; tuberculostatic agent; unclassified drug; pyridine derivative; tuberculostatic agent; ubiquinol cytochrome c reductase; animal experiment; animal model; Article; citric acid cycle; controlled study; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug cytotoxicity; drug distribution; drug half life; drug potentiation; drug resistant tuberculosis; drug synthesis; IC50; in vitro study; in vivo study; maximum concentration; metabolic stability; metabolomics; MIC50; MIC90; mouse; Mycobacterium smegmatis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; pentose phosphate cycle; plasma protein binding; priority journal; redox stress; animal; Bagg albino mouse; drug effect; extensively drug resistant tuberculosis; female; microbial sensitivity test; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; Animals; Antitubercular Agents; Electron Transport Complex III; Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis; Female; Metabolomics; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Pyridines; Tuberculosis, Multidrug-Resistant"
"Reducing patient loneliness with artificial agents: Design insights from evolutionary neuropsychiatry",2019,"Loneliness is a growing public health issue that substantially increases the risk of morbidity and mortality. Artificial agents, such as robots, embodied conversational agents, and chatbots, present an innovation in care delivery and have been shown to reduce patient loneliness by providing social support. However, similar to doctor and patient relationships, the quality of a patient's relationship with an artificial agent can impact support effectiveness as well as care engagement. Incorporating mammalian attachment-building behavior in neural network processing as part of an agent's capabilities may improve relationship quality and engagement between patients and artificial agents. We encourage developers of artificial agents intended to relieve patient loneliness to incorporate design insights from evolutionary neuropsychiatry. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

"Comprehensive approaches to improving nutrition: Future prospects",2019,"When it comes to nutrition, nearly everyone has an opinion. In the past, nutrition was considered to be an individual’s responsibility, however, more recently governments have been expected (by some) to share that responsibility by helping to ensure that marketing is responsible, and that food chains offer healthy meal choices in addition to their standard fare, for example. In some countries, governments have gone as far as to remove tax from unprocessed foods or to introduce taxes, such as that imposed on sugary soft drinks in the UK, Mexico, France and Norway. Following on from the sugar tax, chocolate might be next! Is this the answer to our burgeoning calorie intake and increasing poor nutritional status, or is there another approach? In this narrative we will focus on some of the approaches taken by communities and governments to address excess calorie intake and improve nutritional status, as well as some of the conflicts of interest and challenges faced with implementation. It is clear that in order to achieve meaningful change in the quality of nutritional intake and to reduce the long-term prevalence of obesity, a comprehensive approach is required wherein governments and communities work in genuine partnership. To take no or little action will doom much of today’s youth to a poor quality of life in later years, and a shorter life expectancy than their grandparents. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Locating gambling problems across a continuum of severity: Rasch analysis of the Quinte Longitudinal Study (QLS)",2019,"Addressing gambling problems across a continuum requires understanding of low severity problems, as well as severe levels of problem gambling or disorder. The aims of this study were thus to derive a map of how problematic gambling behaviours and harms are situated across a continuum, and identify the best available indicators of low severity problems to inform assessment and secondary prevention. This involved the Rasch analyses of baseline data from the Quinte Longitudinal Study (QLS); a community-based survey involving random-digit dialling of numbers around Belleville, Canada. Participants were n = 1305 adults with non-zero scores across 26-items from: the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI); the NORC DSM Screen for Gambling Problems (NODS); and the Problem and Pathological Gambling Measure (PPGM). Results indicated that item-level measures except chasing losses provided fit to the Rasch model, and most were clustered within a narrow region of the continuum which resembled addictive disorders. At the most severe end were mainly items about harms, while there were few items representing low severity levels (feeling guilty, betting more than one can afford, attempts to reduce gambling, gambling more than intended). There was Differential Item Functioning (DIF) for several indicators of low severity problems. The findings suggest that measures remain closely aligned with psychiatric models and are suited for discriminating across severe levels of problem gambling or addictive disorder. Although cognitive-affective and behavioural indicators comprise the best available indicators of low severity symptoms, there is an urgent need for improvements in conceptualisation and measurement. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","addiction; adult; Article; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; controlled study; Differential Item Functioning; disease severity; female; guilt; health survey; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; pathological gambling; Problem and Pathological Gambling Measure; Problem Gambling Severity Index; Rasch analysis; scoring system"
"Analysis of two birth tissues provides new insights into the epigenetic landscape of neonates born preterm",2019,"Background: Preterm birth (PTB), defined as child birth before completion of 37 weeks of gestation, is a major challenge in perinatal health care and can bear long-term medical and financial burden. Over a million children die each year due to PTB complications, and those who survive can face developmental delays. Unfortunately, our understanding of the molecular pathways associated with PTB remains limited. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting the role of DNA methylation (DNAm) in mediating the effects of PTB on future health outcomes. Thus, epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS), where DNAm sites are examined for associations with PTB, can help shed light on the biological mechanisms linking the two. Results: In an Asian cohort of 1019 infants (68 preterm, 951 full term), we examined and compared the associations between PTB and genome-wide DNAm profiles using both cord tissue (n = 1019) and cord blood (n = 332) samples on Infinium HumanMethylation450 arrays. PTB was significantly associated (P < 5.8e-7) with DNAm at 296 CpGs (209 genes) in the cord blood. Over 95% of these CpGs were replicated in other PTB/gestational age EWAS conducted in (cord) blood. This replication was apparent even across populations of different ethnic origin (Asians, Caucasians, and African Americans). More than a third of these 296 CpGs were replicated in at least 4 independent studies, thereby identifying a robust set of PTB-linked epigenetic signatures in cord blood. Interrogation of cord tissue in addition to cord blood provided novel insights into the epigenetic status of the neonates born preterm. Overall, 994 CpGs (608 genes, P < 3.7e-7) associated with PTB in cord tissue, of which only 10 of these CpGs were identified in the analysis using cord blood. Genes from cord tissue showed enrichment of molecular pathways related to fetal growth and development, while those from cord blood showed enrichment of immune response pathways. A substantial number of PTB-associated CpGs from both the birth tissues were also associated with gestational age. Conclusions: Our findings provide insights into the epigenetic landscape of neonates born preterm, and that its status is captured more comprehensively by interrogation of more than one neonatal tissue in tandem. Both these neonatal tissues are clinically relevant in their unique ways and require careful consideration in identification of biomarkers related to PTB and gestational age. Trial registration: This birth cohort is a prospective observational study designed to study the developmental origins of health and disease, and was retrospectively registered on 1 July 2010 under the identifier NCT01174875. ? 2019 The Author(s).","African American; Article; Asian; Caucasian; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; epigenetics; ethnic difference; female; fetus growth; gene identification; genome-wide association study; gestational age; human; human tissue; immune response; infant; major clinical study; male; prematurity; priority journal; umbilical cord; umbilical cord blood; Asia; CpG island; DNA methylation; ethnology; genetic epigenesis; genetics; newborn; prematurity; procedures; prospective study; Asia; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Premature Birth; Prospective Studies"
"End-Diastolic and End-Systolic LV Morphology in the Presence of Cardiovascular Risk Factors: A UK Biobank Study",2019,"Left ventricular function and morphology have been shown to be important factors in clinical and pre-clinical cardiovascular disease. In this paper we used atlas-based techniques to capture the full extent of morphological changes at end-diastole, end-systole and in a coupled functional atlas for 4547 UK Biobank participants. The morphological differences between participants with risk factors for cardiovascular disease were tested using a logistic regression model. The result was compared to a model built from traditional mass and volume measures, and the strength of associations were tested using a Delong’s test. Atlas based models had stronger associations with risk factors than mass and volume parameters in most risk factors. The functional atlas showed better performance than the separate end-diastole and end-systole atlases. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Cardiology; Diseases; Heart; Regression analysis; Cardiac atlases; Cardiac MRI; Cardio-vascular disease; Cardio-vascular risk factors; Left ventricular function; Logistic Regression modeling; Morphological changes; Volume parameters; Morphology"
"A comparison of the healthiness of packaged foods and beverages from 12 countries using the Health Star Rating nutrient profiling system, 2013–2018",2019,"We compared the healthiness of packaged foods and beverages between selected countries using the Health Star Rating (HSR) nutrient profiling system. Packaged food and beverage data collected 2013–2018 were obtained for Australia, Canada, Chile, China, India, Hong Kong, Mexico, New Zealand, Slovenia, South Africa, the UK, and USA. Each product was assigned to a food or beverage category and mean HSR was calculated overall by category and by country. Median energy density (kJ/100?g), saturated fat (g/100?g), total sugars (g/100?g) and sodium (mg/100?g) contents were calculated. Countries were ranked by mean HSR and median nutrient levels. Mean HSR for all products (n?=?394,815) was 2.73 (SD 1.38) out of 5.0 (healthiest profile). The UK, USA, Australia and Canada ranked highest for overall nutrient profile (HSR 2.74–2.83) and India, Hong Kong, China and Chile ranked lowest (HSR 2.27–2.44). Countries with higher overall HSR generally ranked better with respect to nutrient levels. India ranked consistently in the least healthy third for all measures. There is considerable variability in the healthiness of packaged foods and beverages in different countries. The finding that packaged foods and beverages are less healthy in middle-income countries such as China and India suggests that nutrient profiling is an important tool to enable policymakers and industry actors to reformulate products available in the marketplace to reduce the risk of obesity and NCDs among populations. ? 2019 World Obesity Federation","saturated fatty acid; sodium; sugar; Article; Australia; calorie; Canada; Chile; China; comparative study; food composition; food quality; Hong Kong; India; Mexico; New Zealand; nutrient content; obesity; processed food; rating scale; Slovenia; South Africa; sugar-sweetened beverage; United Kingdom; United States"
"Renal lymphatics: Anatomy, physiology, and clinical implications",2019,"Renal lymphatics are abundant in the cortex of the normal kidney but have been largely neglected in discussions around renal diseases. They originate in the substance of the renal lobule as blind-ended initial capillaries, and can either follow the main arteries and veins toward the hilum, or penetrate the capsule to join capsular lymphatics. There are no valves present in interlobular lymphatics, which allows lymph formed in the cortex to exit the kidney in either direction. There are very few lymphatics present in the medulla. Lymph is formed from interstitial fluid in the cortex, and is largely composed of capillary filtrate, but also contains fluid reabsorbed from the tubules. The two main factors that contribute to renal lymph formation are interstitial fluid volume and intra-renal venous pressure. Renal lymphatic dysfunction, defined as a failure of renal lymphatics to adequately drain interstitial fluid, can occur by several mechanisms. Renal lymphatic inflow may be overwhelmed in the setting of raised venous pressure (e.g., cardiac failure) or increased capillary permeability (e.g., systemic inflammatory response syndrome). Similarly, renal lymphatic outflow, at the level of the terminal thoracic duct, may be impaired by raised central venous pressures. Renal lymphatic dysfunction, from any cause, results in renal interstitial edema. Beyond a certain point of edema, intra-renal collecting lymphatics may collapse, further impairing lymphatic drainage. Additionally, in an edematous, tense kidney, lymphatic vessels exiting the kidney via the capsule may become blocked at the exit point. The reciprocal negative influences between renal lymphatic dysfunction and renal interstitial edema are expected to decrease renal function due to pressure changes within the encapsulated kidney, and this mechanism may be important in several common renal conditions. ? 2019 Russell, Hong, Windsor, Itkin and Phillips.","cell marker; electrolyte; protein; acute kidney failure; Article; chronic kidney failure; comparative anatomy; congestive heart failure; diuresis; embryology; endothelium cell; glomerulus; human; hydronephrosis; imaging; interstitial fluid; kidney blood flow; kidney blood vessel; kidney function; kidney interstitium; kidney medulla; kidney structure; kidney transplantation; kidney tubule function; kidney tubule pressure; ligation; lymphangiogenesis; lymphatic system; lymphatic system disease; nonhuman; pathological anatomy; pathophysiology; protein transport; pyelolymphatic backflow; venous pressure"
"Enamel defects at Roonka, South Australia: indicators of poor health or the osteological paradox?",2019,"Skeletal evidence of health during the Holocene in south-eastern Australia has contributed to discussions on the mobility and population size of peoples living on the Murray River. One argument is that peoples living on the Murray River experienced poor health evidenced by high frequencies of physiological stress indicators in human remains (enamel hypoplasia, cribra orbitalia, and Harris lines). However, this is not the only explanation for the high frequencies of stress indicators found in these human remains. An alternative but not mutually exclusive interpretation is that individuals with many stress markers such as enamel hypoplasia are the survivors of childhood stressors, and therefore reflect the ability of an individual to overcome periods of physiological stress. The paradoxical interpretation that better health can make for worse skeletons is part of the osteological paradox. These contradictory interpretations can be tested through the analysis of enamel hypoplasia (EH) at Roonka, a large Aboriginal burial site on the Murray River (8,000–200 BP). Survival analysis identifies the mortality consequences of having an enamel defect. This type of analysis allows for a better understanding of the risk associated with having a defect, or multiple defects, in relation to age at death. Age at death and the number of defects was recorded for 130 individuals. The results suggest that, while enamel defects are prevalent among the human remains from Roonka, EH is not associated with an increased risk of death. Results demonstrate that aspects of the osteological paradox are at play in interpretations of enamel defects at Roonka. These results provide evidence that caution is needed when using EH frequency data to argue about past population health. ? 2019, ? 2019 Australian Archaeological Association.",""
"Unlocking intuition and expertise: using interpretative phenomenological analysis to explore clinical decision making",2019,"Background: Clinical decision making is a complex, but important, research area. Decision-making theories have evolved to recognise that, although heuristics and biases can lead to error, expert clinician decision makers can also use intuition to good effect. More research is needed to understand how nurses and other clinicians make sense of complexity and uncertainty. Aim: This paper discusses the utility of interpretative phenomenological analysis to elucidate clinical decision making, expertise and intuition. Methods: A narrative review of published interpretative phenomenological analysis studies exploring clinical decision-making, and discussion of an exemplar study. Results: A limited number of interpretative phenomenological analysis studies have been published in this area. By seeking out descriptions of real-world decision making, interpretative phenomenological analysis research provides ecologically valid insights into what it is like to make time-critical, high-stakes decisions with limited information. Conclusion: Contributing to the study of complex clinical decision making in combination with other research approaches, interpretative phenomenological analysis research has significant unrealised potential to inform education, assessment and support interventions and the development of clinical guidelines. Future applications could enhance understanding of multi-disciplinary decision-making and the development of expertise and intuition, over time. ?

"A catalog of genetic loci associated with kidney function from analyses of a million individuals",2019,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is responsible for a public health burden with multi-systemic complications. Through trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and independent replication (n = 1,046,070), we identified 264 associated loci (166 new). Of these, 147 were likely to be relevant for kidney function on the basis of associations with the alternative kidney function marker blood urea nitrogen (n = 416,178). Pathway and enrichment analyses, including mouse models with renal phenotypes, support the kidney as the main target organ. A genetic risk score for lower eGFR was associated with clinically diagnosed CKD in 452,264 independent individuals. Colocalization analyses of associations with eGFR among 783,978 European-ancestry individuals and gene expression across 46 human tissues, including tubulo-interstitial and glomerular kidney compartments, identified 17 genes differentially expressed in kidney. Fine-mapping highlighted missense driver variants in 11 genes and kidney-specific regulatory variants.

"Packaging development: How chromatin controls transcription in zebrafish embryogenesis",2019,"How developmental gene expression is activated, co-ordinated and maintained is one of the biggest questions in developmental biology. While transcription factors lead the way in directing developmental gene expression, their accessibility to the correct repertoire of genes can depend on other factors such as DNA methylation, the presence of particular histone variants and post-translational modifications of histones. Collectively, factors that modify DNA or affect its packaging and accessibility contribute to a chromatin landscape that helps to control the timely expression of developmental genes. Zebrafish, perhaps better known for their strength as a model of embryology and organogenesis during development, are coming to the fore as a powerful model for interpreting the role played by chromatin in gene expression. Several recent advances have shown that zebrafish exhibit both similarities and differences to other models (and humans) in the way that they employ chromatin mechanisms of gene regulation. Here, I review how chromatin influences developmental transcriptional programmes during early zebrafish development, patterning and organogenesis. Lastly, I briefly highlight the importance of zebrafish chromatin research towards the understanding of human disease and transgenerational inheritance. ? 2019 The Author(s).","cell fate; cell specificity; chromatin; chromatin structure; developmental disorder; developmental gene; embryo development; enhancer region; epigenetics; fish model; gene expression; genetic transcription; genome analysis; genotype environment interaction; human; inheritance; nonhuman; organ patterning; organogenesis; priority journal; Review; zebra fish; zygote; animal; chromatin; embryo development; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; physiology; procedures; zebra fish; Animals; Chromatin; Embryonic Development; Epigenomics; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Zebrafish"
"Transcriptional profiling of the zebrafish proximal tubule",2019,"The hepatocyte nuclear factor-1β (Hnf1b) transcription factor is a key regulator of kidney tubule formation and is associated with a syndrome of renal cysts and early onset diabetes. To further our understanding of Hnf1b in the developing zebrafish kidney, we performed RNA sequencing analysis of proximal tubules from hnf1b-deficient larvae. This analysis revealed an enrichment of gene transcripts encoding transporters of the solute carrier (SLC) superfamily, including multiple members of slc2 and slc5 glucose transporters. An investigation of expression of slc2a1a, slc2a2, and slc5a2 as well as a poorly studied glucose/mannose transporter encoded by slc5a9 revealed that these genes undergo dynamic spatiotemporal changes during tubule formation and maturation. A comparative analysis of zebrafish SLC genes with those expressed in mouse proximal tubules showed a substantial overlap at the level of gene families, indicating a high degree of functional conservation between zebrafish and mammalian proximal tubules. Taken together, our findings are consistent with a role for Hnf1b as a critical determinant of proximal tubule transport function by acting upstream of a large number of SLC genes and validate the zebrafish as a physiologically relevant model of the mammalian proximal tubule. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.","enhanced green fluorescent protein; glucose transporter; glucose transporter 2; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta; organic cation transporter 2; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; solute carrier protein; adult; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; embryo; extracellular matrix; gene number; gene ontology; glucose transport; kidney proximal tubule; mesonephros; multigene family; neural crest cell; nonhuman; priority journal; pronephros; RNA sequence; zebra fish"
"Consumption of Meat, Fish, Dairy Products, and Eggs and Risk of Ischemic Heart Disease: A Prospective Study of 7198 Incident Cases among 409 885 Participants in the Pan-European EPIC Cohort",2019,"Background: There is uncertainty about the relevance of animal foods to the pathogenesis of ischemic heart disease (IHD). We examined meat, fish, dairy products, and eggs and risk for IHD in the pan-European EPIC cohort (European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition). Methods: In this prospective study of 409 885 men and women in 9 European countries, diet was assessed with validated questionnaires and calibrated with 24-hour recalls. Lipids and blood pressure were measured in a subsample. During a mean of 12.6 years of follow-up, 7198 participants had a myocardial infarction or died of IHD. The relationships of animal foods with risk were examined with Cox regression with adjustment for other animal foods and relevant covariates. Results: The hazard ratio (HR) for IHD was 1.19 (95% CI, 1.06-1.33) for a 100-g/d increment in intake of red and processed meat, and this remained significant after exclusion of the first 4 years of follow-up (HR, 1.25 [95% CI, 1.09-1.42]). Risk was inversely associated with intakes of yogurt (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.89-0.98] per 100-g/d increment), cheese (HR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.86-0.98] per 30-g/d increment), and eggs (HR, 0.93 [95% CI, 0.88-0.99] per 20-g/d increment); the associations with yogurt and eggs were attenuated and nonsignificant after exclusion of the first 4 years of follow-up. Risk was not significantly associated with intakes of poultry, fish, or milk. In analyses modeling dietary substitutions, replacement of 100 kcal/d from red and processed meat with 100 kcal/d from fatty fish, yogurt, cheese, or eggs was associated with ?20% lower risk of IHD. Consumption of red and processed meat was positively associated with serum non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration and systolic blood pressure, and consumption of cheese was inversely associated with serum non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Conclusions: Risk for IHD was positively associated with consumption of red and processed meat and inversely associated with consumption of yogurt, cheese, and eggs, although the associations with yogurt and eggs may be influenced by reverse causation bias. It is not clear whether the associations with red and processed meat and cheese reflect causality, but they were consistent with the associations of these foods with plasma non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and for red and processed meat with systolic blood pressure, which could mediate such effects. ? 2018 American Heart Association, Inc.","cholesterol; lipid; yoghurt; adult; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular risk; cheese; cohort analysis; dairy product; egg; Europe; female; fish; follow up; food intake; heart infarction; human; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; male; meat; middle aged; milk; poultry meat; priority journal; processed meat; prospective study; questionnaire; risk assessment; systolic blood pressure"
"Evaluation of an intensive education program on the treatment of tobacco-use disorder for pharmacists: A study protocol for a randomized controlled trial 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1117 Public Health and Health Services",2019,"Background: Tobacco use is presently responsible for the death of over seven million people across the world. In Qatar, it is one of the main causes of premature deaths and preventable diseases. To reduce tobacco use, Qatar has ratified the World Health Organization (WHO)'s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) and has implemented many tobacco-control initiatives. In spite of these measures, tobacco use is still considered a public health threat in Qatar. Pharmacists practicing in retail/community pharmacy settings are often the first port of call for individuals requiring general health advice. Evidence has proven that they have a pivotal role in health promotion and disease prevention including tobacco cessation. However, pharmacists in Qatar are not actively involved in tobacco control and many have not received any education or training about smoking cessation counseling in the past. In an effort to build the capacity of pharmacists towards tobacco control in Qatar, the aim of the proposed study is to design, implement, and evaluate an intensive education program on tobacco dependence treatment for pharmacists in Qatar. Methods/design: The study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing an intensive tobacco-related education program versus non-tobacco-related training on pharmacists' tobacco-use-related knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and skills. Community pharmacists practicing in Qatar will be eligible for participation in the study. A random sample of pharmacists will be selected for participation. Consenting participants will be randomly allocated to intervention or control groups. Participants in the intervention group will receive an intensive education program delivered by a multi-disciplinary group of educators, researchers, and clinicians with expertise in tobacco cessation. A short didactic session on a non-tobacco-related topic will be delivered to pharmacists in the control group. The study has two primary outcomes: post-intervention tobacco-related knowledge and post-intervention skills for tobacco cessation assessed using a multiple-choice-based evaluation instrument and an Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE), respectively. The secondary study outcomes are post-intervention attitudes towards tobacco cessation and self-efficacy in tobacco-cessation interventions assessed using a survey instrument. An additional secondary study outcome is the post-intervention performance difference in relation to tobacco-cessation skills in the practice setting assessed using the simulated client approach. Discussion: If demonstrated to be effective, this education program will be considered as a model that Qatar and the Middle East region can apply to overcome the burden of tobacco-use disorder.

"Lung function: Population epidemiology and concordance in Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents",2019,"Objectives To describe the epidemiology of lung function in Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents, and explore the degree of intergenerational concordance. Design Cross-sectional study (the Child Health CheckPoint) nested in the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Setting Assessment centres in seven Australian cities and eight regional towns, February 2015 to March 2016. Families unable to attend a clinic appointment were offered a home visit during the same period. Participants 1874 families (53% of all eligible) participated in the study. Lung function data were available for 1759 children aged 11-12 years and 1774 parents (1668 biological pairs). Outcome measures Participants completed spirometry with measures including forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and mid expiratory flow (MEF), converted to z-scores using Global Lung Initiative equations. Parent-child concordance was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficients and multivariable linear regression models. Survey weights and methods accounted for LSAC's complex sampling, stratification and clustering within postcodes. Results All lung function measures followed approximately normal distributions. Mean (SD) for FEV1, FVC and MEF z-scores in children were 0.33 (1.07), 0.83 (1.14) and-0.48 (1.09), respectively. Mean (SD) in parents were 0.28 (1.10), 0.85 (1.15) and-0.45 (1.10), respectively. Parent FEV1, FVC and MEF were associated with child lung function with significant positive correlation coefficients (0.22, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.26; 0.24, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.29; and 0.24, 95% CI 0.20 to 0.29, respectively). Conclusions Mean lung volumes were larger but with smaller airway size than international standards for both parents and children in this population sample. Modest associations between parent and child lung function highlight the potential for better identification of 'at risk' populations. Therefore, these findings may aid the development of health policy that aims to prevent the onset or limit the progression of lung disease. ? 2019 Author(s).","adult; Article; Australian; body mass; child; child health; child parent relation; controlled study; cross-sectional study; dyspnea; electric potential; expiratory flow; female; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; home visit; human; linear regression analysis; longitudinal study; lung function; major clinical study; male; middle aged; peak expiratory flow; practice guideline; questionnaire; residual volume; school child; socioeconomics; spirometry; total lung capacity; waist circumference"
"A balancing act: The Supervisor of Training role in anaesthesia education",2019,"In this qualitative study, we report how Supervisors of Training, educational supervisors overseeing the learning of anaesthesia trainees, experience their role in practice. Using purposive sampling, we interviewed Supervisors of Training from across Australia and New Zealand. The interviews began by asking ‘what do you see as your role as a Supervisor of Training?’ then explored the response in detail. Following the technique of thematic analysis, inductive analysis occurred as data were collected until we generated a thematic structure sufficient to address our research question after 19 interviews. In the first three of the four identified themes, Supervisors of Training perceived themselves as the fulcrum of the learning environment, ‘the something in between’. These three themes were: guiding and assessing trainees; identifying, supporting, and adjudicating trainee underperformance; and mediating trainees’ relationship with the hospital. Participants perceived themselves as a broker between trainees, their colleagues, their hospital, the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists and the community to varying degrees at different times. Negotiating these competing responsibilities required Supervisors of Training to manage multiple different relationships and entailed significant emotional work. Our fourth theme, scarcity, described the imbalance between these demands and the time and resources available. The complexity of the Supervisor of Training role and the tensions between these competing demands is underappreciated. Our findings would support strategies to mitigate the administrative load and share the decision-making burden of the role and to enhance the capability of Supervisors of Training by requiring formal training for the role. ?

"Outcomes and practice patterns with hemodiafiltration in Shanghai: A longitudinal cohort study",2019,"Background: Globally, there is increased clinical interest and uptake of hemodiafiltration (HDF) for increased removal of uremic toxins. To date, there has been no epidemiological analysis of HDF in China. We present HDF practice patterns and associated mortality risk in Shanghai. Methods: This is an observational, prospectively collected, retrospective analysis of 9351 Chinese patients initiating hemodialysis in Shanghai from 2007 to 2014. The primary exposure was hemodialysis sub-modality at inception, classified into hemodiafiltration (HDF) and hemodialysis (HD), with adjustment for concommitant hemoperfusion. The primary outcome was patient mortality. We used Cox proportional hazards regression and Fine and Gray's proportional subhazards regression, with multiple imputation of missing co-variates by the chained equation method, adjusting for demographic and clinical variables. Results: Overall, patients in the cohort were younger, with a more males, and with a lower body mass index when compared to corresponding non-Asian cohorts. Mortality rate was low although it doubled over the period of observation. HDF utilization increased from 7% of patients in 2007 to 42% of patients in 2014. The majority of patients received HDF once a week. The adjusted hazard ratio of death (95% confidence intervals) for HDF versus HD was 0.85 (0.71-1.03), and corresponding sub-hazard ratio 0.86 (0.71-1.03). There was strong effect modification by age. In those aged 40-60 years, the hazard ratio (95% confidence intervals) was 0.65 (0.45-0.94), and sub-hazard ratio also 0.65 (0.45-0.95). Conclusions: Our study has certain limitations resulting from the limited number of co-variates available for modelling, missing data for some co-variates, and the lack of verification of data against source documentation. Notwithstanding, there is evidence of clinical benefit from HDF in China, and potential to improve patient outcomes through the greater removal of middle and larger uremic solutes. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; article; body mass; body weight; China; cohort analysis; controlled study; documentation; hemodiafiltration; hemodialysis; hemoperfusion; human; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; prospective study; retrospective study; solute; age distribution; aged; biological model; body size; China; chronic kidney failure; clinical practice; female; hemodiafiltration; longitudinal study; middle aged; mortality; procedures; proportional hazards model; register; sex ratio; treatment outcome; serum albumin; Age Distribution; Aged; Body Size; China; Female; Hemodiafiltration; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Procedures and Techniques Utilization; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries; Retrospective Studies; Serum Albumin; Sex Distribution; Treatment Outcome"
"Detecting tumour response and predicting resectability after neoadjuvant therapy for borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer",2019,"Background: This systematic review aimed to determine the accuracy of imaging modalities to predict resectability and R0 resection for borderline resectable (BRPC) or locally advanced pancreatic cancer (LAPC) after neoadjuvant therapy (NAT). Methods: A systematic search of major databases was performed in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: Fifteen studies identified 995 patients of which 683 had BRPC and 312 LAPC. Computed tomography (CT) scan was the most common modality for re-staging (n = 14), followed by positron emission tomography (PET)-CT (n = 3) and endosonography (EUS) (n = 2). Stable disease on RECIST criteria was found in 67% of patients (range 53–80%) with 20% demonstrating reduction in tumour size. A total of 60% of patients underwent surgery post-NAT (range 31–85%) with a R0 rate of 88% (range 57–100%). Accuracy for predicting R0 resectability and T-stage on CT scan was 71 and 49%. A reduction in SUV max on PET-CT and reduction of tumour stiffness on EUS elastography positively correlated with resectability. Conclusions: More than half the patients undergo resection post-NAT for LAPC and BRPC. Stable, or reduction of, tumour disease may predict resectability. Reduction in tumour SUV max on PET-CT and decreased tumour stiffness on EUS elastography may be potential markers of NAT response and resectability. ? 2018 Royal Australasian College of Surgeons",""
"Olanzapine: A potent agonist at the hM4D(Gi) DREADD amenable to clinical translation of chemogenetics",2019,"Designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) derived from muscarinic receptors not only are a powerful tool to test causality in basic neuroscience but also are potentially amenable to clinical translation. A major obstacle, however, is that the widely used agonist clozapine N-oxide undergoes conversion to clozapine, which penetrates the blood-brain barrier but has an unfavorable side effect profile. Perlapine has been reported to activate DREADDs at nanomolar concentrations but is not approved for use in humans by the Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency, limiting its translational potential. Here, we report that the atypical antipsychotic drug olanzapine, widely available in various formulations, is a potent agonist of the human M4 muscarinic receptor-based DREADD, facilitating clinical translation of chemogenetics to treat central nervous system diseases. ? 2019 The Authors.","Neurology; Atypical antipsychotics; Blood-brain barrier; Central nervous systems; Clinical translation; European medicines agencies; Food and Drug Administration; Muscarinic receptor; Nanomolar concentration; Drug products"
"Improving patient experience and outcomes following serious injury",2019,"AIM: To explore injured patients’ experiences of care to identify areas for improvement in routine service delivery from surgical teams in the transition from inpatient to community-based care. METHODS: Qualitative study drawing on 17 in-depth, semi-structured interviews, conducted from 1 October 2017 to 31 November 2017, with trauma patients (and patient-nominated key support people and health or social care professionals) registered by the Midland Trauma System Registry (New Zealand). RESULTS: All patient respondents had been under the primary care of surgical sub-specialty teams at Waikato Hospital rather than the specialised trauma service that primarily cares for patients with major multi-system trauma. Patients perceived their pre-hospital and emergency care as high quality and highly valued the compassion of staff during their inpatient phase of care. Exceptions were the perception of communication gaps across the spectrum of care from admission to discharge and beyond, limited access to psychosocial services to manage ongoing psychological trauma and a lack of preparedness for discharge. Following discharge, respondents reported the high level of reliance on key support people, inadequate information provision about what to expect in relation to the journey through the health system after discharge, and a lack of coordination of post-discharge care. CONCLUSION: This study highlights perceived issues in the patient care pathway in the transition from inpatient to community-based care, especially communication and discharge information provided by surgical clinical teams and Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC). Comprehensive inpatient care and clinical handover to primary care (rather than discharge planning processes) by dedicated clinical trauma services may provide more holistic models for surgical services to improve their influence on the transition of trauma patients into the community, assisted by organisation changes and support to enable effective service delivery. Specifically, trauma patients and their carers perceived the need for better screening and treatment for psychological trauma in the inpatient and outpatient setting; better information exchange prior to the transition from inpatient to primary care; more convenient and accessible follow-up services including a single point of contact for coordination of post-discharge care; and acknowledgement and practical support to relieve the significant and pervasive carer burden identified in this study. These findings provide the opportunity to implement focused system changes to provide more equitable and effective support in the transition to community care and beyond. The end result will be better experiences for patients and wh?nau, and improved health and vocational outcomes following serious injury. ?

"Health care seeking for maternal and newborn illnesses in low- and middle-income countries: a systematic review of observational and qualitative studies: [Version 1; peer review: 2 approved]",2019,"Background: In low- and middle-income countries, a large number of maternal and newborn deaths occur due to delays in health care seeking. These delays occur at three levels i.e. delay in making decision to seek care, delay in access to care, and delay in receiving care. Factors that cause delays are therefore need to be understand to prevent and avoid these delays to improve health and survival of mothers and babies. ?? Methods: A systematic review of observational and qualitative studies to identify factors and barriers associated with delays in health care seeking. Results: A total of 159 observational and qualitative studies met the inclusion criteria. The review of observational and qualitative studies identified social, cultural and health services factors that contribute to delays in health care seeking, and influence decisions to seek care. Timely recognition of danger signs, availability of finances to arrange for transport and affordability of health care cost, and accessibility to a health facility were some of these factors. Conclusions: Effective dealing of factors that contribute to delays in health care seeking would lead to significant improvements in mortality, morbidity and care seeking outcomes, particularly in countries that share a major brunt of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality.

"New Zealand children's health stamps: Ideological artefacts linking health and place",2019,"This paper addresses a hitherto unexamined phenomenon in the geography of health promotion: the use of postage stamps. We ‘read’ health stamps as featuring imagery and exhortations that reflect temporally-specific understandings of children's health and wellbeing. As a case study, we examine examples of the stamps sold annually since 1929 as a fund-raiser for New Zealand Children's Health Camps Foundation. This government-supported voluntary sector agency sought to offer respite for children from unhealthy environments and enhance their wellbeing through offering opportunities in semi-rural locations focusing on nutrition and exercise. Recently, emphasis changed to concern with behavioural issues such as self-esteem. The annual stamp appeal continued until 2016 with nuanced themes (e.g., birds and butterflies, invoking associated ideas of children as vulnerable yet precious and needing protection). Our goal is two-fold: first, we seek to theorise the role of the postage stamp in mobilising health-promoting messages; and, second, we examine changing imaginaries associated with child health included in this annual series of stamps. Drawing on assemblage theory, we read the act of purchasing children's health stamps as offering a tacit seal of approval for child health. Through assembling resources, personnel and ideas about health, they reflected and reproduced the nation state and its goals for children's health while also crossing national boundaries. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","child health; governance approach; health care; health services; nutritional status; rural area; service provision; article; artifact; bird; butterfly; child; child health; drawing; exercise; female; geography; government; health promotion; human; human experiment; imagery; male; New Zealand; New Zealander; nonhuman; nutrition; purchasing; self esteem; transcription initiation; wellbeing; New Zealand; Aves; Papilionoidea"
"Serum lipid profile as a biomarker of intra-pancreatic fat deposition: A nested cross-sectional study",2019,"Background and aims: The relationship between intra-pancreatic fat deposition (IPFD) and lipid profile has been investigated in individuals with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes, but not in healthy non-obese individuals and those after acute pancreatitis. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between serum lipid profile and IPFD in the latter individuals and to determine the effect of abdominal fat distribution and other covariates. Methods and results: A total of 90 individuals with a history of acute pancreatitis as well as 23 healthy non-obese individuals participated in the study. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify IPFD and visceral-to-subcutaneous fat volume ratio, followed by fasting state measurement of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol (TC), TC/HDL-C ratio, and triglycerides. In healthy non-obese individuals, IPFD was not significantly associated with any of the studied markers. In individuals after acute pancreatitis, IPFD was significantly associated with triglycerides in both unadjusted (β = 0.360; 95% CI, 0.090–0.629; p = 0.009) and adjusted models, with a β-coefficient of 0.280 [(95% CI, 0.016–0.545); p = 0.038] in the most adjusted model. Also, IPFD was significantly associated with TC/HDL-C ratio in both unadjusted (β = 0.336; 95% CI, 0.045–0.626; p = 0.024) and adjusted models, with a β-coefficient of 0.375 [(95% CI, 0.090–0.660); p = 0.010] in the most adjusted model. Multiple regression yielded triglycerides, but not TC/HDL-C ratio, as a significant marker of IPFD in individuals after acute pancreatitis. Conclusions: Serum lipid profile is not associated with IPFD in healthy non-obese. Triglycerides, but not other components of lipid profile, is a promising biomarker for IPFD in individuals following acute pancreatitis. ? 2019 The Italian Society of Diabetology, the Italian Society for the Study of Atherosclerosis, the Italian Society of Human Nutrition, and the Department of Clinical Medicine and Surgery, Federico II University","biological marker; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; affinity chromatography; aged; amylase blood level; Article; body mass; computer assisted tomography; cross-sectional study; echography; hip circumference; human; intra pancreatic fat deposition; lipid blood level; lipid fingerprinting; lipid metabolism; lipid storage; major clinical study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; obesity; pancreatitis; priority journal; subcutaneous fat; waist circumference"
"Nutrition risk and mortality in older oncology patients: An exploratory study",2019,"Aim: The primary aim of this analysis was to identify if two standard measures incorporated into the comprehensive geriatric assessment; specifically, malnutrition risk and body mass index (BMI), could predict 12-month mortality in older patients with solid tumours. The secondary aim was to evaluate if malnutrition risk and BMI were associated with chemotherapy outcomes (discontinuation/modification of treatment) in older patients with solid tumours. Methods: Older patients (aged ?70 years) with solid cancers were recruited from the outpatient oncology clinic of a tertiary hospital in Brisbane, Australia. Participants’ nutritional parameters, BMI, and malnutrition risk (determined using the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST)) were recorded at baseline. Mortality data and chemotherapy outcomes were recorded for 12 months. Results: Seventy-four participants (67% males, median age 77 (±4.4) years) were recruited. Nearly half the cohort was at-risk of malnutrition at baseline (n = 39, 46%). Chemotherapy was prescribed to 39% (n = 29) of the cohort. For patients receiving chemotherapy neither being underweight nor having a low or medium risk of malnutrition was associated with adverse chemotherapy outcomes or 12-month mortality. At a bivariate level, malnutrition risk was significantly associated with 12-month mortality in patients who did not receive chemotherapy (P = 0.018), but not BMI. Conclusions: This analysis indicates that malnutrition risk was a potential indicator of 12-month mortality in cases where chemotherapy was considered unfeasible. However, this was not an independent risk factor. Further investigation using a larger sample is required to determine the association between malnutrition risk, quality of life and mortality in patients who are not considered to be fit for chemotherapy. ? 2019 Dietitians Association of Australia",""
"The synthesis and evaluation of quinolinequinones as anti-mycobacterial agents",2019,"A library of thirty-two quinolinequinones (QQs) with various amine substituents at the 6- and 7-positions were synthesised efficiently and in good yields for evaluation as potential anti-tuberculosis agents. Mycobacterium tuberculosis growth inhibition assays demonstrated that QQs bearing moderate length alkyl chains (i.e. heptylphenylamino- and octylamino-QQs), and aryl groups (i.e. phenylethylamino- and benzylamino-QQs) exhibited encouraging inhibitory activity, while QQ analogue 7-chloro-6-propargylamino-quinoline-5,8-dione (16b) had excellent inhibitory activity (MIC = 8 μM). The cLogP values and redox activities of the QQs were determined, and neither readout correlated with the anti-mycobacterial activities of the compounds. Notwithstanding, mode of action studies of 16b revealed that treatment of M. tuberculosis with this compound led to activation of NADH-dependent oxygen consumption suggesting a redox cycling mechanism. To this end, the promising anti-mycobacterial activity of several QQs and their ability to perturb oxygen management leading to an uncontrolled respiratory burst, as identified in this work and by others, demonstrates the merit of further optimising the anti-mycobacterial activity of this readily synthesised class of compound. ? 2019","6 chloro 2 methyl 7 octylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 2 methyl 7 phenylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 2 methyl 7 phenylethylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 2 methyl 7 propargylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 2 methyl 7 propylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 2 methyl 7 tert butylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 7 (4 heptylphenyl)amino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 7 dimethylamino 2 methylquinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 7 octylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 7 phenylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 7 phenylethylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 7 piperidinyl quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 7 propargylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 6 chloro 7 propylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 2 methyl 6 octylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 2 methyl 6 phenylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 2 methyl 6 phenylethylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 2 methyl 6 piperidinyl quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 2 methyl 6 propargylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 2 methyl 6 propylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 2 methyl 6 tert butylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 6 octylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 6 phenylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 6 phenylethylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 6 propargylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 6 propylamino quinoline 5,8 dione; 7 chloro 7 dimethylamino 2 methylquinoline 5,8 dione; antimycobacterial agent; quinoline derivative; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; antibacterial activity; Article; controlled study; drug screening; drug structure; drug synthesis; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; oxygen consumption"
"Chronic High-Fat Diet Exacerbates Sexually Dimorphic Pomctm1/tm1 Mouse Obesity",2019,"Mice with a targeted mutation in the pro-opiomelanocortin (Pomc) gene (Pomctm1/tm1 mice) are unable to synthesize desacetyl-α-MSH and α-MSH and they develop obesity when fed chow diet. In this study, we hypothesized that a chronic high-fat (HF) diet exacerbates Pomctm1/tm1 mouse obesity. Male and female Pomcwt/wt and Pomctm1/tm1 mice were fed low-fat (LF) (10 kcal percent fat) or HF (45 kcal percent fat) diets from weaning for 23 weeks. We show that Pomctm1/tm1 mouse obesity is sexually dimorphic and exacerbated by an HF diet. Male Pomctm1/tm1 mice develop obesity because they are hyperphagic compared with Pomcwt/wt mice when fed an LF or HF diet. Female Pomctm1/tm1 mice develop obesity when feeding on an LF or HF diet because they exhibit signs of reduced energy expenditure (no change in feed efficiency; body weight gained exceeding energy intake) compared with Pomcwt/wt mice. A chronic HF diet exacerbates male Pomctm1/tm1 and Pomcwt/wt mouse obesity, and the increased energy intake fully accounts for increased weight gain. In contrast, female Pomcwt/wt mice are protected from chronic HF diet-induced obesity because they reduce the amount of HF diet eaten, and they appear to increase their energy expenditure (no change in feed efficiency but energy intake exceeding body weight gained). A chronic HF diet exacerbates female Pomctm1/tm1 mouse obesity due to impaired ability to reduce the amount of HF diet eaten and apparent impaired HF diet-induced adaptive thermogenesis. Our data show that desacetyl-α-MSH and α-MSH are required for sexually dimorphic HF diet-induced C57BL/6J obesity. In conclusion, desacetyl-α-MSH and α-MSH play salutary roles in sexually dimorphic melanocortin obesity and sexually dimorphic HF diet-induced C57BL/6J obesity.

"Adherence to neonatal hypoglycaemia guidelines: A retrospective cohort study",2020,"Aim: To determine if the routine use of automatically calculated birthweight centiles prior to discharge from the delivery unit is associated with improved adherence to the neonatal hypoglycaemia guideline. Methods: We conducted retrospective audits of adherence to the neonatal hypoglycaemia guideline in a tertiary maternity hospital in Auckland, New Zealand in a randomly selected cohort of newborn infants at risk of neonatal hypoglycaemia before (2011) and after (2015) the introduction of routine use of calculated birthweight centiles for all infants. The primary outcome was adherence to the guideline, defined as (i) blood glucose concentration screening in the first 48 h after birth; (ii) the initial measurement taken 1–2 h after birth; and (iii) at least three consecutive blood glucose concentrations ?2.6 mmol/L, over 12 h, prior to cessation of screening. Results: The audits examined the records of 400 infants (200 each in 2011 and 2015) to determine guideline adherence. Adherence improved from 2011 to 2015 (59/200 (30%) vs. 95/200 (48%), P < 0.001), with the largest improvement in large-for-gestational age infants (7/50 (14%) vs. 25/50 (50%), P = <0.001). Screened infants whose care was adherent to the guideline had a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia detection (adherent, 64/154 (42%) vs. non-adherent, 34/246 (14%), P < 0.001). Conclusions: The routine use of calculated birthweight centiles was associated with improved adherence to the neonatal hypoglycaemia guideline and increased detection of neonatal hypoglycaemia in at-risk infants. Thus, identifying practices that improve guideline adherence may improve the detection of hypoglycaemia in asymptomatic at-risk infants. ? 2019 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","glucose; adult; Article; automation; birth weight; blood glucose monitoring; clinical audit; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; glucose blood level; hospital discharge; human; hypoglycemia; incidence; large for gestational age; major clinical study; male; medical record; New Zealand; newborn; newborn screening; observational study; obstetric delivery; patient compliance; practice guideline; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; tertiary care center; treatment refusal"
"Evaluation of prices, availability and affordability of essential medicines in Lahore Division, Pakistan: A cross-sectional survey using WHO/HAI methodology",2019,"Inadequate access to medicines affected by un-controlled prices is a major concern in developing countries, including Pakistan, which lacks comprehensive data on medicine prices. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the prices, availability and affordability of essential medicines in Lahore division, Pakistan. The survey was undertaken from November, 2016 till March, 2017 by including 50 medicines, 14 from the WHO/HAI core list and 36 supplementary medicines from national essential medicine list (NEML) at public (n = 16) and private (n = 16) health facilities. The prices, availability and affordability of selected medicines were measured using a variant of the WHO/HAI standard methodology available on HAI website and WHO/HAI manual. A questionnaire was used for data collection from Lahore division. The prices were compared to International reference prices (IRPs) and the daily wage of a lowest paid unskilled government worker was used to calculate medicine affordability. Data suggested poor availability of originator brands (OB) in public and private sector facilities, i.e., 6.8% and 55.0%, respectively. Similarly, low availability was observed for lowest price generics (LPGs), both in public (35.3%) and private sector (20.3%) facilities–far below the WHO global action plan targets of 80% availability of essential medicines by 2025. In private sector, 53% OB and 38% LPG medicines were found excessively priced. The cost of standard treatment with OBs was unaffordable, i.e., above a single daily wage (1.4 day’s wages) was demanded to purchase the standard treatment for the selected diseases in case of OBs medicines. Whereas, the cost of LPGs medicine required to purchase the standard treatment of the selected diseases was 0.6 day’s wage (median), below a single daily wage. In conclusion, access to essential medicines, especially at public sector facilities was affected by low availability, particularly of OBs in comparison to LPGs. Thus, the better availability of LPGs might be a rational basis of transition into a generic system of prescribing that may improve the availability and accessibility of essential medicines in Lahore division. Medicine prices in Lahore division were found higher in comparison to IRPs. Thus, the efforts must be made to formulate patient’s pocket friendly drug pricing policy that favors price cuts and improves affordability. ? 2019 Saeed et al.

"Paramedic student confidence, concerns, learning and experience with resuscitation decision-making and patient death: A pilot survey",2019,"Background: Around the world, many paramedics are authorised to withhold or terminate resuscitation. Research indicates this can be a challenging part of their role. Little is known about graduating paramedic student confidence, concerns and learning in this area. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey of students nearing completion of a paramedic degree in New Zealand, including piloting of a newly-developed confidence scale. Results: Seventy-two participants reported varying exposure to termination of resuscitation and patient death. Participants felt most confident providing technical procedurally-based care and least confident with non-technical skills. Participants’ greatest concerns included making ‘the right call’, supporting grieving family, controlling emotions and encountering conflict. Clinical exposure with supportive mentoring, clinical simulation, peer reflection and resolved personal experience with death, were considered most useful for professional development. Conclusions: Exposure to termination of resuscitation and management of the scene of a patient death is variable amongst graduating paramedics. Novice paramedics may benefit from opportunities to observe and rehearse non-technical skills including delivering death notification and communicating with bystanders and bereaved family. The Confidence with Resuscitation Decision-Making and Patient Death Scale has favourable psychometric properties and utility as an outcome measure for future research in this area. ? 2019 College of Emergency Nursing Australasia","adult; article; death; decision making; emergency health service; female; grief; human; major clinical study; male; mentoring; New Zealand; outcome assessment; personal experience; professional development; resuscitation; simulation; skill; student"

"Characteristics of Female Youth Offenders in New Zealand",2019,"Female youth offending is poorly understood, despite increased rates of such offending. Research indicates there are a range of factors that have a causal impact on the development of offending in young people. This study investigated risk factors using a retrospective file audit of 184 female youth offenders in New Zealand. The findings were classified using Bronfenbrenner’s ecological model, which highlights the different contextual levels that influence behavior, including individual, family, peer, school, community, and cultural factors. The results indicate that there are significant risk factors for female youth offenders. There were high rates of mental health difficulties, drug use, histories of maltreatment, family stressors, peer issues, and school behavior problems in the cohort. There was very little difference between violent and nonviolent offenders. All the young women had risk factors affecting them at many levels. Targeted, multisystemic intervention and prevention programs are therefore needed to address female youth offending. ?

"Workplace wellbeing in an urban emergency department in Aotearoa New Zealand",2019,"Objectives: Staff wellbeing is important for individuals and considered integral to the development and maintenance of high performing health systems. Unless baseline parameters of wellbeing are known, the effects of any interventions to improve staff wellbeing will remain uncertain. By clarifying staff perceptions and objective measures of important factors related to wellbeing, our primary goal was to assess the baseline wellbeing of staff in our central city ED. Methods: A survey template, the WoWe@AED (Workplace Wellbeing at the Adult Emergency Department) was developed from several sources. Burnout was measured using the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Inclusion in the survey required that participants worked in our ED, all staff groups were eligible. The electronic survey was conducted between 22 January and 5 February 2018. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed. Results: Two hundred and seventy (71.1%) of 380 potential participants participated. All staff groups were represented. About 72.4% agreed/strongly agreed that Adult Emergency Department was an excellent place to work, 80.7% found their work meaningful. About 42.0% felt well informed regarding important decisions. One hundred and eighty-three (48.2%) out of 380 completed the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Overall, personal burnout was 42.1% (n = 77), work-related burnout was 35% (n = 64) and client-related burnout was 27.9% (n = 51). Females were significantly (<0.05) more likely to have burnout in some or all domains. Four key themes were identified: supportive teamwork and relationships; providing high quality patient care; resourcing; and workload issues. Conclusions: Baseline indices of wellbeing of the frontline staff in a central city ED have been documented. These have informed wellbeing interventions. Future measures can be compared against these data. ? 2019 Australasian College for Emergency Medicine","adult; article; burnout; controlled study; emergency health service; emergency ward; female; human; major clinical study; New Zealand; patient care; quantitative analysis; staff; teamwork; wellbeing; workload; workplace"
"Comparison of financial support for family caregivers of people at the end of life across six countries: A descriptive study",2019,"Background: Family caregivers of people at the end of life can face significant financial burden. While appropriate financial support can reduce the burden for family caregivers, little is known about the range and adequacy of financial support, welfare and benefits for family caregivers across countries with similarly developed health care systems. Aim: The aim is o identify and compare sources of financial support for family caregivers of people approaching the end of life, across six countries with similarly performing health care systems (Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States). Design: A survey of financial support, welfare and benefits for end of life family caregivers was completed by 99 palliative care experts from the six countries. Grey literature searches and academic database searches were also conducted. Comparative analyses of all data sources documented financial support within and between each country. Results: Some form of financial support for family caregivers is available in all six countries; however the type, extent and reach of support vary. Financial support is administered by multiple agencies, eligibility criteria for receiving support are numerous and complex, and there is considerable inequity in the provision of support. Conclusion: Numerous barriers exist to the receipt of financial support, welfare and benefits. We identified several areas of concern, including a lack of clarity around eligibility, inconsistent implementation, complexity in process and limited support for working carers. Nonetheless, there is significant potential for policymakers to learn from other countries’ experiences, particularly with regard to the scope and operationalisation of financial support. ?

"International Epidemiological Differences in Acute Poisonings in Pediatric Emergency Departments",2019,"Background and Objective: Identifying international differences in the epidemiology of acute poisonings in children may help in improving prevention. We sought to evaluate the international epidemiological differences in acute poisonings in children presenting to emergency departments (EDs) from 8 different global regions. Methods: This was an international multicenter cross-sectional prospective study including children younger than 18 years with acute poisonings presenting to 105 EDs in 20 countries was conducted. Data collection started at each ED between January and September 2013, and continued for 1 year. Results: During the study period, we registered 363,245 pediatric ED presentations, of which 1727 were for poisoning (0.47%; 95% confidence interval, 0.45%-0.50%), with a significant variation in incidence between the regions. Full data were obtained for 1688 presentations. Most poisonings (1361 [80.6%]) occurred at home with either ingestion (1504 [89.0%]) or inhalation of the toxin (126 [7.6%]). Nonintentional exposures accounted for 1157 poisonings (68.5%; mainly in South America and Eastern Mediterranean region), with therapeutic drugs (494 [42.7%]), household products (310 [26.8%]), and pesticides (59 [5.1%]) being the most common toxins. Suicide attempts accounted for 233 exposures (13.8%; mainly in the Western Pacific region and North America), with therapeutic drugs (214 [91.8%], mainly psychotropics and acetaminophen) being the most common toxins. Significant differences between regions were found in both types of poisonings. Recreational poisonings were more common in Europe and Western Pacific region. No patient died. Conclusions: There are substantial epidemiological differences in acute poisonings among children in different countries and regions of the globe. International best practices need to be identified for prevention of acute poisonings in childhood. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Prediction Models for Early Childhood Obesity: Applicability and Existing Issues",2019,"Statistical models have been developed for the prediction or diagnosis of a wide range of outcomes. However, to our knowledge, only 7 published studies have reported models to specifically predict overweight and/or obesity in early childhood. These models were developed using known risk factors and vary greatly in terms of their discrimination and predictive capacities. There are currently no established guidelines on what constitutes an acceptable level of risk (i.e., risk threshold) for childhood obesity prediction models, but these should be set following consideration of the consequences of false-positive and false-negative predictions, as well as any relevant clinical guidelines. To date, no studies have examined the impact of using early childhood obesity prediction models as intervention tools. While these are potentially valuable to inform targeted interventions, the heterogeneity of the existing models and the lack of consensus on adequate thresholds limit their usefulness in practice. ? 2019 S.

"Health-resource use and quality of life in children with bronchiectasis: A multi-center pilot cohort study",2019,"Background: Bronchiectasis in children is an important, but under-researched, chronic pulmonary disorder that has negative impacts on health-related quality of life. Despite this, it does not receive the same attention as other chronic pulmonary conditions in children such as cystic fibrosis. We measured health resource use and health-related quality of life over a 12-month period in children with bronchiectasis. Methods: We undertook a prospective cohort study of 85 children aged < 18-years with high-resolution chest computed-tomography confirmed bronchiectasis undergoing management in three pediatric respiratory medical clinics in Darwin and Brisbane, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. Children with cystic fibrosis or receiving cancer treatment were excluded. Data collected included the frequency of healthcare attendances (general practice, specialists, hospital and/or emergency departments, and other), medication use, work and school/childcare absences for parents/carers and children respectively, and both parent/carer and child reported quality of life and cough severity. Results: Overall, 951 child-months of observation were completed for 85 children (median age 8.7-years, interquartile range 5.4-11.3). The mean (standard deviation) number of exacerbations was 3.3 (2.2) per child-year. Thirty of 264 (11.4%) exacerbation episodes required hospitalization. Healthcare attendance and antibiotic use rates were high (30 and 50 per 100 child-months of observation respectively). A carer took leave from work for 53/236 (22.5%) routine clinic visits. Absences from school/childcare due to bronchiectasis were 24.9 children per 100 child-months. Quality of life scores for both the parent/carer and child were highly-correlated with one another, remained stable over time and were negatively associated with cough severity. Conclusions: Health resource use in this cohort of children is high, reflecting their severe disease burden. Studies are now needed to quantify the direct and societal costs of disease and to evaluate interventions that may reduce disease burden, particularly hospitalizations. ? 2019 The Author(s).","antiinfective agent; bronchiectasis; child; clinical trial; disease exacerbation; economics; female; health service; hospitalization; human; male; multicenter study; patient attitude; pilot study; preschool child; prospective study; quality of life; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bronchiectasis; Child; Child, Preschool; Disease Progression; Female; Health Services Needs and Demand; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life"
"The Influence of Primary Motor Cortex Inhibition on Upper Limb Impairment and Function in Chronic Stroke: A Multimodal Study",2019,"Background. Stroke is a leading cause of adult disability owing largely to motor impairment and loss of function. After stroke, there may be abnormalities in γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibitory function within primary motor cortex (M1), which may have implications for residual motor impairment and the potential for functional improvements at the chronic stage. Objective. To quantify GABA neurotransmission and concentration within ipsilesional and contralesional M1 and determine if they relate to upper limb impairment and function at the chronic stage of stroke. Methods. Twelve chronic stroke patients and 16 age-similar controls were recruited for the study. Upper limb impairment and function were assessed with the Fugl-Meyer Upper Extremity Scale and Action Research Arm Test. Threshold tracking paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation protocols were used to examine short- and long-interval intracortical inhibition and late cortical disinhibition. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to evaluate GABA concentration. Results. Short-interval intracortical inhibition was similar between patients and controls (P =.10). Long-interval intracortical inhibition was greater in ipsilesional M1 compared with controls (P <.001). Patients who did not exhibit late cortical disinhibition in ipsilesional M1 were those with greater upper limb impairment and worse function (P =.002 and P =.017). GABA concentration was lower within ipsilesional (P =.009) and contralesional (P =.021) M1 compared with controls, resulting in an elevated excitation-inhibition ratio for patients. Conclusion. These findings indicate that ipsilesional and contralesional M1 GABAergic inhibition are altered in this small cohort of chronic stroke patients. Further study is warranted to determine how M1 inhibitory networks might be targeted to improve motor function. ?

"In vivo confocal microscopy of the inflamed anterior segment: A review of clinical and research applications",2019,"In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) allows non-invasive imaging of the living human cornea, specifically enabling the detection of immune cells in the healthy and diseased ocular anterior segment. Studies using IVCM have provided insight into the effects of contact lens wear on corneal Langerhans cell density and morphology, and the effects of eye drops on conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue. IVCM has also been shown to be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in distinguishing infective and non-infective uveitis and in diagnosing atypical infective keratitis. In the research setting, this technology has enhanced our understanding of the role of inflammatory cells in corneal neuropathy and angiogenesis. In vivo-ex vivo correlation using animal models has helped overcome some of the difficulties in identifying cell type on IVCM images. As highlighted in this review, currently there are multiple established, and emerging, clinical and research applications for IVCM in the inflamed anterior segment. ? 2019 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists","Acanthamoeba keratitis; angiogenesis; anterior eye segment; cell density; cell function; cell structure; confocal microscopy; cornea disease; eye disease; human; immunocompetent cell; in vivo study; inflammatory cell; Langerhans cell; lymphoid tissue; microsporidiosis; nocardiosis; nonhuman; Review; uveitis"
"African-Americans and Indigenous Peoples Have Increased Burden of Diseases of the Exocrine Pancreas: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2019,"Ethnic health disparity is a well-acknowledged issue in many disease settings, but not diseases of the exocrine pancreas. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to explore the race- and ethnicity-specific burden of diseases of the exocrine pancreas. Studies that compared health-related endpoints between two or more ethnicities were eligible for inclusion. Proportion meta-analyses were conducted to compare burden between groups. A total of 42 studies (24 on pancreatic cancer, 17 on pancreatitis, and one on pancreatic cyst) were included in the systematic review, of which 19 studies were suitable for meta-analyses. The incidence of pancreatic cancer was 1.4-fold higher?among African–Americans, while the incidence of acute pancreatitis was 4.8-fold higher among an indigenous population (New Zealand M?ori) compared with Caucasians. The prevalence of post-pancreatitis diabetes mellitus was up to 3.0-fold higher among certain ethnicities, including Asians, Pacific Islanders, and indigenous populations compared with Caucasians. The burden of diseases of the exocrine pancreas differs between ethnicities, with African-Americans and certain indigenous populations being at the greatest risk of developing these diseases. Development of race- and ethnicity-specific screening as well as protocols for lifestyle modifications may need to be considered with a view to reducing the disparities in burden of diseases of the exocrine pancreas. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","acute pancreatitis; African American; Article; Asian; cancer incidence; cancer mortality; cancer survival; Caucasian; diabetes mellitus; disease burden; exocrine pancreas; human; indigenous people; lifestyle modification; meta analysis; Pacific Islander; pancreas cancer; pancreas cyst; pancreas disease; pancreatitis; priority journal; systematic review; African American; diabetes mellitus; ethnology; health disparity; incidence; lifestyle; minority health; mortality; pancreas cyst; pancreas disease; pancreas tumor; pancreatitis; pathology; population group; risk factor; African Americans; Diabetes Mellitus; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Incidence; Life Style; Minority Health; Pancreas, Exocrine; Pancreatic Cyst; Pancreatic Diseases; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis; Population Groups; Risk Factors"
"Mapping a route to Indigenous engagement in cancer genomic research",2019,"Precision oncology guided by genomic research has an increasingly important role in the care of people with cancer. However, substantial inequities remain in cancer outcomes of Indigenous peoples, including Indigenous M?ori in Aotearoa New Zealand (New Zealand). These inequities will be perpetuated unless deliberate steps are taken to include Indigenous peoples in all parts of cancer research—as research participants, in research leadership, and in research governance. This approach is especially important when there have been historical breaches of trust that have discouraged their participation in health research. This Personal View describes a precision oncology research roadmap for neuroendocrine tumour research, which seeks to reflect the values of New Zealand's Indigenous M?ori people. This roadmap includes facilitating ongoing dialogue, M?ori leadership, reciprocity, agreed kawa (guiding principles), tikanga (cultural protocols), and honest monitoring of what is and what is not being achieved. We challenge cancer researchers worldwide to generate locally appropriate roadmaps that honestly assess their practices to benefit Indigenous people internationally. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","cancer genetics; cancer research; cultural factor; health care planning; health care quality; health equity; human; indigenous people; Maori (people); New Zealand; personalized medicine; practice guideline; priority journal; Review"
"Global observational needs and resources for marine biodiversity",2019,"The diversity of life in the sea is critical to the health of ocean ecosystems that support living resources and therefore essential to the economic, nutritional, recreational, and health needs of billions of people. Yet there is evidence that the biodiversity of many marine habitats is being altered in response to a changing climate and human activity. Understanding this change, and forecasting where changes are likely to occur, requires monitoring of organism diversity, distribution, abundance, and health. It requires a minimum of measurements including productivity and ecosystem function, species composition, allelic diversity, and genetic expression. These observations need to be complemented with metrics of environmental change and socio-economic drivers. However, existing global ocean observing infrastructure and programs often do not explicitly consider observations of marine biodiversity and associated processes. Much effort has focused on physical, chemical and some biogeochemical measurements. Broad partnerships, shared approaches, and best practices are now being organized to implement an integrated observing system that serves information to resource managers and decision-makers, scientists and educators, from local to global scales. This integrated observing system of ocean life is now possible due to recent developments among satellite, airborne, and in situ sensors in conjunction with increases in information system capability and capacity, along with an improved understanding of marine processes represented in new physical, biogeochemical, and biological models. ? 2019 Canonico, Buttigieg, Montes, Muller-Karger, Stepien, Wright, Benson, Helmuth, Costello, Sousa-Pinto, Saeedi, Newton, Appeltans, Bednar?ek, Bodrossy, Best, Brandt, Goodwin, Iken, Marques, Miloslavich, Ostrowski, Turner, Achterberg, Barry, Defeo, Bigatti, Henry, Ramiro-S?nchez, Dur?n, Morato, Roberts, Garc?a-Alegre, Cuadrado and Murton.",""
"What does the future hold for relocated communities post-disaster? Factors affecting livelihood resilience",2019,"Building livelihood resilience to natural disasters holds the key to sustained income generation and economic development in disaster-affected areas. This paper identifies the critical factors driving livelihood resilience in post-disaster relocated communities. A questionnaire survey and interviews in five selected relocation sites in Banda Aceh and Aceh Besar, Indonesia, were undertaken following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. We found that early recovery income support, physical and mental health, ability to transfer to other jobs/skills, availability and timeliness of livelihood support, together with its cultural sensitivity and governance structure are among the most important factors. Given the nature of resettlement, access to infrastructure, location of relocated sites and safety of neighbourhoods also played an important role in establishing sustained employment for these relocated communities in Indonesia. Under the precarious conditions of displacement, the livelihood outcome of those relocated seemed to be more tied with how their resettlement can be supported than with their own efforts. The findings highlight the importance of a coordinated approach to providing livelihood support among different organisations based on regular needs assessment throughout the recovery course. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",""
"Implementing Trauma-Informed Care in Correctional Treatment and Supervision",2019,"This article provides a rationale for trauma-informed care (TIC) in correctional services, and challenges readers to think about offending behavior through the lens of trauma.

Using Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)’s core principles of TIC, this article will make suggestions for the implementation of trauma-informed service delivery and practices across correctional settings. The authors translate trauma-informed concepts into practice behaviors through the acronym SHARE (safety, hope, autonomy, respect, empathy), which honors the principles of TIC recommended by SAMHSA and the principles of effective correctional rehabilitation.

"Associations of Gout and Baseline Serum Urate Level With Cardiovascular Outcomes: Analysis of the Coronary Disease Cohort Study",2019,"Objective: To determine whether gout and serum urate (SU) levels are associated with increased risk of death, time to first readmission for any cardiovascular event, or incident heart failure in individuals with cardiovascular disease. Methods: Individuals presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) were enrolled in the Coronary Disease Cohort Study. Clinical data were collected from the medical records at the index hospital admission, and clinical, echocardiographic, and biochemical data were collected postdischarge. Gout was defined by self-report, use of urate-lowering therapy, or use of colchicine with evidence of gout on review of the medical record. The primary end points were all-cause mortality, time to readmission for a cardiac ischemic event, and time to readmission for heart failure. Results: Data from 1,514 participants were available. During the follow-up period, 53 of 160 participants with gout (33.1%) and 298 of 1,354 participants without gout (22.0%) died. After adjustment for other factors known to be associated with mortality, there was no gout-specific increase in risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.98 [95% confidence interval 0.69–1.38]). Time to readmission for heart failure was significantly briefer in those with, compared to those without, gout (adjusted hazard ratio 1.42 [95% confidence interval 1.02–1.97]). Irrespective of whether a participant had gout or not, as SU level increased, there was an increased risk of death and readmission for either a cardiovascular event or heart failure. Conclusion: Survival post-ACS is similar with and without the presence of gout. People with gout are at an increased risk of readmission for heart failure and have longer hospital stays. Risk of these events increases in parallel with increases in SU levels. ? 2019, American College of Rheumatology","colchicine; urate; acute coronary syndrome; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; coronary artery disease; echocardiography; female; follow up; gout; heart failure; hospital admission; hospital readmission; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; risk factor; self report; uric acid blood level"
"Service user, wh?nau and peer support workers’ perceptions of advance directives for mental health",2019,"Advance directives allow users of mental health services to make statements for their future care. In New Zealand, use of advance directives is supported by the Health and Disability Commissioner and was identified in the 2012 Blueprint as a key mechanism for service users to advocate for responses they find most helpful. This study used a qualitative descriptive methodology involving focus groups to explore the perceptions of service users, wh?nau and peer support workers concerning advance directives. Thematic analysis revealed certain belief patterns about what should or could be included in an advance directive, and about how and with whom one should be created. It revealed generally positive perceptions about how they can uphold service users’ right to have preferences considered, to plan flexibly around dynamic needs, and about their value and utility. We conclude that advance directives can support services users’ expressions of their preferences for care, but they need to be supported by clinicians if they are to realize this potential. Our findings can also inform service provision in New Zealand, and the planned reform of mental health legislation. ? 2019 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.",""
"The potential of a human rights approach for accelerating the implementation of comprehensive restrictions on the marketing of unhealthy foods and non-alcoholic beverages to children",2019,"Overweight and obesity in children is rising at the global level, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Among the causes for this increase is the marketing of unhealthy food and beverage products, which affects children's food preferences, purchasing requests and consumption patterns. The need to address harmful marketing to children has been recognized at the World Health Organization, with Member States having agreed in 2010 to implement a set of recommendations to restrict such practices. Concurrently, there is an increasing understanding of unhealthy food and malnutrition as human rights concerns. This paper explores the potential of existing legally and non-legally binding human rights instruments for accelerating the implementation of comprehensive restrictions to reduce harmful marketing of unhealthy foods and beverages to children. Four relevant themes were identified in existing human rights instruments: (i) the best interest of the child should be considered above all other interests; (ii) the rights to health and adequate food cannot be realized without supportive healthy environments; (iii) children should be protected from economic exploitation; and (iv) the persuasive marketing of unhealthy food and beverage products is explicitly recognized as a threat to the rights to food and health. In conclusion, existing human rights instruments could be harnessed to advance public health measures to restrict the marketing of unhealthy food and beverage products to children. Policy-makers and advocates should draw from these instruments and refer to State's obligations within international and domestic human rights law to strengthen their efforts to restrict harmful marketing practices to children. ?

"Preferred learning modalities and practice for critical skills: A global survey of paediatric emergency medicine clinicians",2019,"Objective To describe senior paediatric emergency clinician perspectives on the optimal frequency of and preferred modalities for practising critical paediatric procedures. Methods Multicentre multicountry cross-sectional survey of senior paediatric emergency clinicians working in 96 EDs affiliated with the Pediatric Emergency Research Network. Results 1332/2446 (54%) clinicians provided information on suggested frequency of practice and preferred learning modalities for 18 critical procedures. Yearly practice was recommended for six procedures (bag valve mask ventilation, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), endotracheal intubation, laryngeal mask airway insertion, defibrillation/direct current (DC) cardioversion and intraosseous needle insertion) by at least 80% of respondents. 16 procedures were recommended for yearly practice by at least 50% of respondents. Two procedures (venous cutdown and ED thoracotomy) had yearly practice recommended by <40% of respondents. Simulation was the preferred learning modality for CPR, bag valve mask ventilation, DC cardioversion and transcutaneous pacing. Practice in alternative clinical settings (eg, the operating room) was the preferred learning modality for endotracheal intubation and laryngeal mask insertion. Use of models/mannequins for isolated procedural training was the preferred learning modality for all other invasive procedures. Free-text responses suggested the utility of cadaver labs and animal labs for more invasive procedures (thoracotomy, intercostal catheter insertion, open surgical airways, venous cutdown and pericardiocentesis). Conclusions Paediatric ED clinicians suggest that most paediatric critical procedures should be practised at least annually. The preferred learning modality depends on the skill practised; alternative clinical settings are thought to be most useful for standard airway manoeuvres, while simulation-based experiential learning is applicable for most other procedures. ?

"Infant food security in New Zealand: A multidimensional index developed from cohort data",2019,"Food security (FS) during infancy is associated with lifelong outcomes. New Zealand is a developed economy that reports poor childhood nutrition-related health statistics, particularly among minority children, yet has no measure of FS applicable to infancy. The objective was to develop an FS index for New Zealand infants and examine its association with demographic covariates and health outcomes. Within a large (n = 6853) nationally representative cohort, variables describing infant food consumption, breastfeeding, and maternal food-related coping methods were collected from mothers during late infancy. An FS index was derived using confirmatory factor analysis. Associations were assessed by logistic regressions and described using odds ratios (OR) and ?95% confidence intervals (CI). Fifteen percent of the cohort was highly FS, 43% tenuously food insecure (FIS), and 16% highly food insecure (FIS). Infants from minority ethnic groups had lower odds of being food secure, as did those born to the youngest mothers, mothers who smoked, or those who lived in low-income households. FIS infants had higher odds of morbidity. Interventions to improve infant FS should focus on improving dietary quality, and should give particular consideration to minority infants. We identified that FIS shows wide ethnic and socioeconomic inequity, and is associated with poorer health. The most important driving factors of FIS included poor quality weaning diets, as well as poverty and its proxies. Any interventions to improve infant FS should focus on increasing fruit and vegetable consumption to recommended intake levels, and should give particular consideration to minority infants. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Antidiabetic medications and mortality risk in individuals with pancreatic cancer-related diabetes and postpancreatitis diabetes: A nationwide cohort study",2019,"OBJECTIVE There are no specific treatment guidelines for diabetes of the exocrine pancreas. High-quality studies are warranted to investigate whether the use of antidiabetic medications has survival benefit in individuals with diabetes of the exocrine pancreas. The objective was to determine the risk of mortality associated with the use of antidiabetic medications in individuals with pancreatic cancer-related diabetes (PCRD) and postpancreatitis diabetes mellitus (PPDM). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Nationwide pharmaceutical dispensing data (2006-2015) linked to hospital discharge data were used to identify 1,862 individuals with PCRD or PPDM. Multivariable Cox regression analysis was conducted, and the risk was expressed as hazard ratios and 95% CIs. A 6-month lag was used to minimize reverse causality. RESULTS In individuals with PCRD, ever users of metformin (adjusted hazard ratio 0.54; 95% CI 0.46-0.63) and ever users of insulin (adjusted hazard ratio 0.46; 95% CI 0.39-0.55) had significantly lower risks of mortality compared with never users of antidiabetic medications. These associations attenuated toward the null with the use of a 6-month lag. In individuals with PPDM, ever users of metformin had a significantly lower risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.51; 95% CI 0.36-0.70), whereas everusers of insulin did not have a significantly changed risk of mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 0.75; 95% CI 0.49-1.14) compared with never users of antidiabetic medications. The former association remained significant with the use of a 6-month lag. CONCLUSIONS Metformin promotes a survival benefit in individuals with PPDM but not PCRD. Reverse causality may play a role in the association between insulin use and mortality in PCRD. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.","2,4 thiazolidinedione derivative; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; insulin; metformin; sulfonylurea; adult; aged; Article; causality; cohort analysis; diabetes mellitus; drug use; female; hospital discharge; human; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; mortality risk; pancreas cancer; pancreatitis; survival rate"
"Health experiences of children and young people who migrate – Opportunities for health education",2019,"Research on migration and health is gaining significant ground, with a focus on the adverse physical and mental health outcomes experienced by migrants. The health-related experiences of children and young people who migrate, however, are relatively absent, with children’s migration and health status often conflated with that of their parents. The omission of children’s own perspectives limits knowledge about how health is understood and experienced by child migrants, including the identification of best ways to support their health. Drawing on the empirical literature on child migrants and health from the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Western Pacific Region, we adopt a critical perspective to examine how the research to date supports a particular way of understanding and investigating the health of children and young people who migrate. Specifically, we highlight how a dominant focus on parents’ migration status, (negative) health outcomes and patterns of risk behaviours limits, rather than aids, the understanding of migrant children’s health. In doing so, we illustrate how much of the evidence base upholds Westernised biomedical notions of health and privileges the use of particular methodologies to assess health outcomes and reduce health risks. These preferences, in turn, shape the subsequent range of ‘appropriate’ forms of health education for, rather than with, children. We conclude by drawing on some exceptions and consider the opportunities these provide for developing health education in line with children’s own understandings of health – crucially underscoring the importance migrant children and young people attach to the more social aspects of their health and migration experiences. ?

"Bilateral ulcerative keratitis associated with afatinib treatment for non-small-cell lung carcinoma",2019,"Purpose:To report a case of afatinib-related bilateral ulcerative keratitis.Methods:An 85-year-old female patient on treatment with afatinib for non-small-cell lung carcinoma presented with progressive redness, pain, and decreased vision in both eyes. Four weeks before the onset of symptoms, afatinib therapy had been commenced at a dose of 40 mg, once daily. Clinical examination, OCT imaging, photographs, and corneal scrapes were completed at presentation. Afatinib was discontinued. Topical and oral therapy were commenced to treat ulcerative keratitis with close monitoring for signs of progression or corneal perforation.Results:Significant stromal thinning was detected in the inferior cornea of both eyes with an overlying epithelial defect and no infiltrate. No organisms were identified from the corneal scrapes. The patient responded well to treatment, and her vision returned to baseline 4 months after presentation.Conclusions:To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case in the literature that reports afatinib-related ulcerative keratitis. Careful monitoring for signs of ocular adverse events is recommended during treatment with afatinib for non-small-cell lung carcinoma. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Estimation and exposure concentration of trihalomethanes (THMs) and its human carcinogenic risk in supplied pipeline water of Dhaka City, Bangladesh",2019,"Formation of trihalomethanes (THMs) through excessive chlorination in the supplied water and its carcinogenic nature is a public health concern in many parts of the world, including a couple of neighboring countries in Asia. However, the issue was not yet addressed either in the public health policy or in academia in Bangladesh. Therefore, the objectives of this study are to determine the THM concentration in supplied water, its multiple pathways to the human body, and an estimation of resultant carcinogenic risk to urban dwellers in six different regions of Dhaka city. Thirty-one supplied water samples were collected from 31 different water points located in Purana Paltan, Naya Paltan, Kallyanpur, Shyamoli, Malibagh-Rampura, and Panthapath regions in premonsoon time. Total chlorine and chlorine dioxide (ClO2) and trihalomethane (THM) concentration were determined using UV-VIS spectrophotometer; total organic carbon (TOC), total inorganic carbon, and total carbon concentration were measured using TOC analyzer, and chloroform concentration was determined by applying gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy (GC-MS-MS) in the supplied water samples. Research findings indicate that THM concentration exceeded the USEPA acceptable limit (80?ppb) in all regions except Panthapath. Study results showed that carcinogenic risk via ingestion was higher than the USEPA acceptable limit of 10?6. Carcinogenic risk via dermal absorption and inhalation exposure was lower according to USPEA acceptable limit. To conclude, this study represents the current knowledge about THM concentration in supplied pipeline water and adverse health risk, which signifies that regulatory measures should be taken to reduce the THM concentration. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","absorption; carcinogen; chemical compound; chloroform; concentration (composition); drinking water; estimation method; health policy; health risk; public health; total organic carbon; Bangladesh; Dhaka [Bangladesh]; carbon; carcinogen; chlorine; chlorine derivative; chlorine dioxide; chloroform; oxide; trihalomethane; analysis; Bangladesh; chemistry; city; dietary exposure; environmental exposure; halogenation; human; procedures; risk assessment; toxicity; water pollutant; water supply; Bangladesh; Carbon; Carcinogens; Chlorine; Chlorine Compounds; Chloroform; Cities; Dietary Exposure; Environmental Exposure; Halogenation; Humans; Oxides; Risk Assessment; Trihalomethanes; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Supply"
"Microsimulation model of child and adolescent overweight: making use of what we already know",2019,"Background: New Zealand has high rates of child overweight and obesity when compared with other countries. Despite an abundance of research documenting the problem, it is unclear what the most effective policy changes or interventions are, and how policy changes might unfold over time within complex systems. Methods: We use estimates derived from meta-analyses to create a dynamic microsimulation model of child overweight (including obesity). Using census records we created a synthetic birth cohort of 10,000 children. Information on parental education, ethnicity and father’s socio-economic position at birth were taken from census records. We used the New Zealand Health Survey to estimate population base rates for the prevalence of overweight and obesity. Information on other modifiers (such as maternal smoking, breastfeeding, preterm birth, regular breakfast consumption and so forth) were taken from three birth cohorts: Christchurch Health and Development Study, The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study and the Pacific Islands Families Study. Published intervention studies were used to derive plausible estimates for changes to modifiers. Results: Reducing the proportion of mothers classified as overweight and obesity (?3.31(95% CI ?3.55; ?3.07) percentage points), reducing the proportion of children watching two or more hours of TV (?3.78(95% CI ?4.01; ?3.54)), increasing the proportion of children eating breakfast regularly (?1.71(95% CI ?1.96; ?1.46)), and reducing the proportion of children born with high birth weights (?1.36(95% CI ?1.61; ?1.11)), lead to sizable decreases in the estimated prevalence of child overweight (including obesity). Reducing the proportion of mothers giving birth by caesarean (?0.23(95% CI ?0.49; ?0.23)) and increasing parental education (?0.07(95% CI ?0.31; 0.18)) did not impact upon child overweight rates. Conclusions: We created a working simulation model of New Zealand children that can be accessed by policy makers and researchers to determine known relationships between predictors and child overweight, as well as potential gains from targeting specific pathways. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.","adolescent; adolescent obesity; adult; Article; Asian; breast feeding; cesarean section; child; childhood obesity; cohort analysis; ethnicity; father; female; food intake; high birth weight; human; major clinical study; male; Maori (people); maternal smoking; meal; New Zealand; observational study; Pacific Islander; parenting education; premature labor; preschool child; prevalence; priority journal; socioeconomics"

"Review: The role of computational simulation in understanding the postoperative sinonasal environment",2019,"Nasal surgery improves symptoms in a majority of patients for whom medical treatment has failed. In rhinosinusitis patients, endoscopic sinus surgery aims to alleviate obstruction and re-establish mucociliary clearance. Surgery alters the structure-function relationship within the nasal passage, which is difficult to assess clinically. Computational modelling has been used to investigate this relationship by simulating air flow and environmental variables inside realistic three-dimensional models of the human nasal airway but many questions remain unanswered and need further investigation. The application of computational models to improve pre-surgical planning and post-surgical treatment may not be currently possible due to the absence of knowledge correlating the model-predicted parameters to physiological variables. Links between these parameters to patient outcomes are yet to be established. This article reviews the recent application of computational modelling to understand the nasal structure-function relationship following surgery in patients with sinusitis and nasal obstruction. ? 2018","Computation theory; Computational fluid dynamics; Endoscopy; Knowledge based systems; Surgery; Computational modelling; Computational simulation; Endoscopic Sinus Surgery; Endoscopic surgery; Environmental variables; Patient outcomes; Rhinosinusitis; Structure-function relationship; Physiological models; airway; anatomical variation; Article; computational fluid dynamics; disease burden; drug delivery system; drug distribution; endoscopic sinus surgery; human; mucociliary clearance; nose cavity; nose disease; nose obstruction; postoperative period; priority journal; rhinosinusitis; simulation; structure activity relation; surgical patient; treatment outcome"

"The importance of user segmentation for designing digital therapy for adolescent mental health: Findings from scoping processes",2019,"Background: New Zealand youth, especially those of Maori and Pacific descent, have high rates of depression, anxiety, and self-harm, but have low rates of help-seeking from mental health professionals. Apps, computerized therapy, and other digital tools can be effective, highly scalable treatments for anxiety and depression. Co-design processes are often used to foster engagement with end users, but this does not always lead to high levels of engagement. Objective: We aimed to carry out preliminary scoping to understand adolescents' current internet use and diversity of preferences to inform a planned co-design process for creating digital mental health tools for teenagers. Methods: Interactive workshops and focus groups were held with young people. Data were analyzed using a general inductive approach. Results: Participants (N=58) engaged in 2 whanau (extended family) focus groups (n=4 and n=5), 2 school- or community-based focus groups (n=9 each), and 2 workshops (n=11 and n=20). The authors identified 3 overarching themes: (1) Digital mental health tools are unlikely to be successful if they rely solely on youth help-seeking. (2) A single approach is unlikely to appeal to all. Participants had diverse, noncompatible preferences in terms of look or feel of an app or digital tool. The authors identified 4 user groups players or gamers, engagers, sceptics, and straight-talkers. These groups differed by age and degree of current mental health need and preferred gamified or fun approaches, were open to a range of approaches, were generally disinterested, or preferred direct-to-the-point, serious approaches, respectively. (3) Digital mental health tools should provide an immediate response to a range of different issues and challenges that a young person may face. Conclusions: Defining the preferences of different groups of users may be important for increasing engagement with digital therapies even within specific population and mental health-need groups. This study demonstrates the importance of scoping possible user needs to inform design processes. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research. All rights reserved.",""
"Observations on the Natural History of Camurati-Engelmann Disease",2019,"Camurati-Engelmann disease (OMIM 31300) is a rare cranio-tubular bone dysplasia characterized by osteosclerosis of the long bones and skull caused by dominantly-inherited mutations in the transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) gene. A wide variation in phenotype has been recognized, even within families carrying the same mutation. In addition, aspects of the natural history of the disorder, in particular whether it is always progressive or can remit spontaneously, remain uncertain. In a large kindred carrying a TGFB1 gene mutation (c.653G > A; p.R218H) we have attempted to clarify the extent of phenotypic variability and the natural history of the disease through detailed individual histories of symptoms, and skeletal imaging by both radiography and scintigraphy. Only one subject had the classical childhood onset with bone pain in the legs and gait disturbance. Eight subjects reported the onset of leg pain in their teenage years that, by their early 20s, had either resolved or persisted at a low level. Two of these eight later developed cranial nerve palsies. There was a wide variation in the radiographic appearance in adults, but disease extent and activity in long bones, as assessed by scintigraphy, was inversely correlated with age (p < 0.025). In younger subjects the radiographic and scintigraphic appearances were concordant, but in older subjects the scintigram could be quiescent despite florid radiographic changes. Sequential scintigrams in two subjects showed reduced activity in the later scan. One subject had suffered meningoencephalitis in early childhood that resulted in paresis of one arm. The affected arm showed markedly less disease involvement, implicating mechanical or growth factors in its etiology. Our data suggest that the natural history of Camurati-Engelmann disease can be benign, and that disease activity commonly attenuates in adulthood. Severe cases of childhood onset and/or with cranial nerve involvement, may occur only in a minority of mutation carriers. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ? 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research","losartan; prednisone; adolescent; adult; adulthood; age; Article; bone scintiscanning; Camurati Engelmann disease; child; clinical article; cranial nerve paralysis; decompression surgery; disease activity; female; headache; hearing impairment; human; leg pain; long bone; male; meningoencephalitis; middle aged; muscle twitch; muscle weakness; osteoarthritis; paresthesia; pedigree analysis; preschool child; vestibulocochlear nerve; visual impairment; young adult"
"Levetiracetam versus phenytoin for second-line treatment of convulsive status epilepticus in children (ConSEPT): an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial",2019,"Background: Phenytoin is the current standard of care for second-line treatment of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus after failure of first-line benzodiazepines, but is only effective in 60% of cases and is associated with considerable adverse effects. A newer anticonvulsant, levetiracetam, can be given more quickly, is potentially more efficacious, and has a more tolerable adverse effect profile. We aimed to determine whether phenytoin or levetiracetam is the superior second-line treatment for paediatric convulsive status epilepticus. Methods: ConSEPT was an open-label, multicentre, randomised controlled trial conducted in 13 emergency departments in Australia and New Zealand. Children aged between 3 months and 16 years, with convulsive status epilepticus that failed first-line benzodiazepine treatment, were randomly assigned (1:1) using a computer-generated permuted block (block sizes 2 and 4) randomisation sequence, stratified by site and age (?5 years, >5 years), to receive 20 mg/kg phenytoin (intravenous or intraosseous infusion over 20 min) or 40 mg/kg levetiracetam (intravenous or intraosseous infusion over 5 min). The primary outcome was clinical cessation of seizure activity 5 min after the completion of infusion of the study drug. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ACTRN12615000129583. Findings: Between March 19, 2015, and Nov 29, 2017, 639 children presented to participating emergency departments with convulsive status epilepticus; 127 were missed, and 278 did not meet eligibility criteria. The parents of one child declined to give consent, leaving 233 children (114 assigned to phenytoin and 119 assigned to levetiracetam) in the intention-to-treat population. Clinical cessation of seizure activity 5 min after completion of infusion of study drug occurred in 68 (60%) patients in the phenytoin group and 60 (50%) patients in the levetiracetam group (risk difference ?9·2% [95% CI ?21·9 to 3·5]; p=0·16). One participant in the phenytoin group died at 27 days because of haemorrhagic encephalitis; this death was not thought to be due to the study drug. There were no other serious adverse events. Interpretation: Levetiracetam is not superior to phenytoin for second-line management of paediatric convulsive status epilepticus.

"Fixed-combination, low-dose, triple-pill antihypertensive medication versus usual care in patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension in Sri Lanka: a within-trial and modelled economic evaluation of the TRIUMPH trial",2019,"Background: Elevated blood pressure incurs a major health and economic burden, particularly in low-income and middle-income countries. The Triple Pill versus Usual Care Management for Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Hypertension (TRIUMPH) trial showed a greater reduction in blood pressure in patients using fixed-combination, low-dose, triple-pill antihypertensive therapy (consisting of amlodipine, telmisartan, and chlorthalidone) than in those receiving usual care in Sri Lanka. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of the triple-pill strategy. Methods: We did a within-trial (6-month) and modelled (10-year) economic evaluation of the TRIUMPH trial, using the health system perspective. Health-care costs, reported in 2017 US dollars, were determined from trial records and published literature. A discrete-time simulation model was developed, extrapolating trial findings of reduced systolic blood pressure to 10-year health-care costs, cardiovascular disease events, and mortality. The primary outcomes were the proportion of people reaching blood pressure targets (at 6 months from baseline) and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted (at 10 years from baseline). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated to estimate the cost per additional participant achieving target blood pressure at 6 months and cost per DALY averted over 10 years. Findings: The triple-pill strategy, compared with usual care, cost an additional US$9·63 (95% CI 5·29 to 13·97) per person in the within-trial analysis and $347·75 (285·55 to 412·54) per person in the modelled analysis. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were estimated at $7·93 (95% CI 6·59 to 11·84) per participant reaching blood pressure targets at 6 months and $2842·79 (?28·67 to 5714·24) per DALY averted over a 10-year period. Interpretation: Compared with usual care, the triple-pill strategy is cost-effective for patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension. Scaled up investment in the triple pill for hypertension management in Sri Lanka should be supported to address the high population burden of cardiovascular disease.

"Multicentre retrospective study to assess diagnostic accuracy of ultrasound for superficial endometriosis—Are we any closer?",2019,"Background: To establish whether the ultrasound findings of minimal endometriosis are confirmed at laparoscopy and that a correlation can be established as to the anatomical sites in this mild form of the disease. Aims: Patients with pain and suspicion of endometriosis had an ultrasound scan by a sonologist with expertise in endometriosis as part of their pre-operative workup. Measurements and Main results: The clinical histories of 53 patients who had laparoscopy to investigate pelvic pain were reviewed. Ultrasounds were performed between 2012 and 2015 by a single sonologist with expertise in endometriosis assessments. The ultrasound findings were divided into subgroups as follows – presence of uterosacral ligament thickness, thickened pericolic fat, ovarian mobility and focal tenderness. These were compared with operative findings of those patients with superficial endometriosis. Evidence Level 3 – observational studies with controls and health services research that includes adjustment for likely confounding factors. Results: Seventy-nine percent (42/53) of the patients had laparoscopic findings consistent with their ultrasound findings (95% CI 68–90%, P?<?0.0001). Of the subgroups that we reviewed, uterosacral thickening (P?<?0.05) and thickened pericolic fat (P?<?0.05) were the most associated with superficial endometriosis at the time of laparoscopy. Conclusion: Markers on ultrasound that reliably demonstrated inflammation (thickened uterosacral ligaments and thickened pericolic fat) were shown to be significantly associated with the disease. ? 2018 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists","Article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; dysmenorrhea; endometriosis; female; human; inflammation; intra-abdominal fat; laparoscopy; ligament; major clinical study; pelvic pain; pericolic fat; preoperative care; priority journal; retrospective study; thickness; transvaginal echography; uterosacral ligament"
"Nutritional management of moderate–late preterm infants: Survey of current practice",2019,"Aim: Moderate–late preterm (MLPT) babies account for over 80% of preterm babies born world-wide. Many MLPT babies require early nutritional support while full sucking feeds are established, but there is little evidence to guide practice. We aimed to determine current practice in Australia and New Zealand. Methods: An electronic survey was sent to neonatal clinical directors within the Australia and New Zealand Neonatal Network requesting dissemination to colleagues involved in the care of MLPT babies (32–35 +6 weeks’ gestation). The questionnaire asked about respondents’ nutritional management of MLPT babies and included scenarios for both moderate- (MPT) and late preterm (LPT) babies. Results: There were 83 respondents. While waiting for mothers' milk to meet prescribed fluid volumes, 61% (MPT) to 53% (LPT) of respondents would provide dextrose 10% as the first nutritional support, with 15% (MPT) to 38% (LPT) providing infant formula. Of clinicians providing 10% dextrose, 31% (MPT) to 49% (LPT) were happy to do so for ?3 days, with 5% comfortable doing so for 5 days in moderately preterm babies, before providing additional support. This additional support was infant formula in 73% (MPT) to 90% (LPT) of respondents. Conclusions: There is variation in the nutritional management of MLPT infants amongst neonatal clinicians, likely due to the lack of evidence from randomised controlled trials on which to base clinical practice. The majority of clinicians are happy providing only dextrose 10% for up to 2–3 days despite this form of nutritional support containing only carbohydrate. ? 2018 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)","glucose; Article; artificial milk; Australia; breast milk; clinical practice; controlled study; gestational age; human; infant; infant feeding; infant nutrition; information processing; New Zealand; nutritional support; prematurity; priority journal; questionnaire"
"Reported adherence to current antenatal corticosteroid guidelines in Australia and New Zealand",2019,"Background: Antenatal corticosteroids (ANC) reduce mortality and morbidity in preterm babies, but prescription practices vary. Aims: To assess obstetricians’ compliance with the recommendations of the Australian and New Zealand clinical practice guidelines on use of ANC. Materials and Methods: An anonymous online questionnaire was distributed to Fellows of the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Results: All respondents reported prescribing an initial course of ANC according to the guidelines if preterm birth at 28?weeks’ gestation was expected within 24 or 72?h. However, 22% reported prescribing ANC even if birth was not expected within seven?days. This was reported more often by practitioners not using adjunct tests to predict preterm birth (14% vs 69%; P < 0.001). An initial course of ANC at ?35?weeks was prescribed by 52% of respondents. However, 93% reported prescribing ANC at ?35?weeks prior to elective caesarean section. Repeat courses of ANC were prescribed by 76% of respondents. Of these, 89% reported prescribing repeat courses beyond the guideline recommendations at ?33?weeks and 29% exceeded the recommendations on number of repeat courses. Conclusions: For infants born at <35?weeks, current ANC prescribing patterns in Australia and New Zealand are consistent with the guideline recommendations and result in high rates of administration in this group.

"Treatment and survival of Asian women diagnosed with breast cancer in New Zealand",2019,"Purpose: This study aims to examine the differences in characteristics, treatment and survival between Asian and European women diagnosed with stage I–III breast cancer in New Zealand. Methods: The studied population included European women and Asian women diagnosed with stage I–III breast cancer between June 2000 and May 2013 identified from the combined Waikato and Auckland Breast Cancer Registers. Characteristics and treatment were compared between Asian and European women. Kaplan–Meier method was used to examine the survival difference. Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of mortality. Results: The studied cohort included 8608 European and 949 Asian women. Asian women were younger, had less comorbidities and were less likely to be obese than European women. Asian women were more likely to have grade 3, larger and HER2+ breast cancers. Asian women were more likely to receive mastectomy, less likely to have reconstruction after mastectomy, less likely to have chemotherapy, less likely to be treated with trastuzumab if HER2+, and had better adherence to endocrine therapy (adjusted odds ratio: 1.54; 95% CI 1.22–1.93). Asian women had better cancer-specific survival and all-cause survival than European women. The adjusted HR of cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality were 0.64 (95% CI 0.49–0.82) and 0.68 (95% CI 0.55–0.84), respectively. Conclusions: Asian women are more likely to have high grade, larger and HER2+ breast cancers than European women. In spite of this, they had better breast cancer outcomes. Possible explanations include the differences in adherence to endocrine therapy, age, BMI and comorbidities. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","trastuzumab; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; Asian; body mass; breast cancer; cancer chemotherapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; cancer specific survival; cancer staging; cancer survival; comorbidity; European; female; hazard ratio; human; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; mastectomy; New Zealand; partial mastectomy; priority journal; proportional hazards model; very elderly; breast tumor; disease management; ethnology; follow up; health care survey; mortality; prognosis; register; treatment outcome; Breast Neoplasms; Disease Management; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Neoplasm Staging; New Zealand; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Registries; Treatment Outcome"
"Are maternal and neonatal outcomes different in placental abruption between women with and without preeclampsia?",2019,"Introduction: Placental abruption is a serious pregnancy complication that causes maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidity. Whether maternal and neonatal outcomes differ between patients who concurrently presented with preeclampsia and those who did not, have not been fully investigated. Methods: A total number of 158 patients with placental abruption were included. Of them, 66 concurrently had preeclampsia. Maternal and neonatal characteristics including delivery weeks, time of onset and birthweight as well as the grade of placental abruption were collected and analysed. Results: The time at diagnosis of placental abruption in patients who concurrently presented preeclampsia was significantly earlier than that in patients who did not. The number of patients with grade III placental abruption was significantly higher in patients who concurrently presented with preeclampsia, compared to patients who did not. The odds ratio of an increase in grade III placental abruption in patients who concurrently presented preeclampsia was 5.27 (95%CL: 2.346, 12.41), compared to patients who did not. The numbers of infants who were born pre-term and the numbers of stillbirth/neonatal deaths as well as the number of fetal distress were significantly higher in patients who concurrently presented with preeclampsia, compared to patients who did not. The fetal birthweight was significantly lower in patients who concurrently presented with preeclampsia compared to patients who did not. Discussion: Our study demonstrates that women with preeclampsia experiencing placental abruption had worse maternal, fetal and neonatal outcomes, compared to women experiencing placental abruption alone. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","abdominal pain; Article; birth weight; clinical outcome; female; fetus distress; human; live birth; major clinical study; maternal age; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn death; obstetric delivery; postpartum hemorrhage; preeclampsia; pregnancy; priority journal; retrospective study; solutio placentae; stillbirth; vagina bleeding"
"The Dysphagia in Stroke Protocol Reduces Aspiration Pneumonia in Patients with Dysphagia Following Acute Stroke: a Clinical Audit",2019,"Cough reflex testing has been evaluated as a component of the clinical swallowing assessment as a means of identifying patients at risk of aspiration during swallowing. A previous study by our research group found good sensitivity and specificity of the cough reflex test for identifying patients at risk of aspiration post-stroke, yet its use did not decrease pneumonia rates, contrary to previous reports. The aim of this study was to expand on our earlier work by implementing a clinical management protocol incorporating cough reflex testing within the same healthcare setting and compare patient outcomes to those from the original study and to evaluate clinical outcomes in patients with acute stroke who were managed using the Dysphagia in Stroke Protocol (DiSP). Secondarily, to compare those outcomes to historical data prior to implementation of the DiSP. This clinical audit measured outcomes from 284 patients with acute stroke managed per the DiSP, which guides use of videofluoroscopic swallowing study and patient management based on clinical exam with cough reflex testing. Data from our previous trial were included for comparison of pre- and post-DiSP patient outcomes. Data collection took place between November 2012 and April 2016 at four urban hospitals within New Zealand. Following implementation of the DiSP, the rate of aspiration pneumonia (10%) was substantially lower than the pre-DiSP rate (28%), with no pneumonia readmissions within 3?months. Pneumonia-related mortality was unchanged. By 3?months, 81% of the patients were on a normal diet and 67% had returned home, compared to pre-DiSP outcomes of 55% and 55% respectively. Previous work has suggested that simply implementing cough reflex testing in dysphagia management may not be sufficient to improve patient outcomes. The present study adds to this picture by suggesting that the true variable of influence may be the way in which the results of the test are applied to patient care. There is a strong case to support the use of a structured protocol if cough reflex testing is to be implemented in clinical practice. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","aged; Article; aspiration pneumonia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical audit; clinical outcome; coughing; dysphagia; female; hospital readmission; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; patient care; priority journal; swallowing; aspiration pneumonia; cerebrovascular accident; complication; disease management; dysphagia; middle aged; New Zealand; physiology; reflex; retrospective study; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Deglutition Disorders; Disease Management; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Pneumonia, Aspiration; Reflex; Retrospective Studies; Stroke"
"Human Neural Tissues from Neural Stem Cells Using Conductive Biogel and Printed Polymer Microelectrode Arrays for 3D Electrical Stimulation",2019,"Electricity is important in the physiology and development of human tissues such as embryonic and fetal development, and tissue regeneration for wound healing. Accordingly, electrical stimulation (ES) is increasingly being applied to influence cell behavior and function for a biomimetic approach to in vitro cell culture and tissue engineering. Here, the application of conductive polymer (CP) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-polystyrenesulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) pillars is described, direct-write printed in an array format, for 3D ES of maturing neural tissues that are derived from human neural stem cells (NSCs). NSCs are initially encapsulated within a conductive polysaccharide-based biogel interfaced with the CP pillar microelectrode arrays (MEAs), followed by differentiation in situ to neurons and supporting neuroglia during stimulation. Electrochemical properties of the pillar electrodes and the biogel support their electrical performance. Remarkably, stimulated constructs are characterized by widespread tracts of high-density mature neurons and enhanced maturation of functional neural networks. Formation of tissues using the 3D MEAs substantiates the platform for advanced clinically relevant neural tissue induction, with the system likely amendable to diverse cell types to create other neural and non-neural tissues. The platform may be useful for both research and translation, including modeling tissue development, function and dysfunction, electroceuticals, drug screening, and regenerative medicine. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Characteristics and outcomes of patients requiring bailout use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors for thrombotic complications of percutaneous coronary intervention: An analysis from the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial",2019,"Aims: To describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients receiving bailout glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors (GPI) for thrombotic complications of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in a large, contemporary trial. Methods and results: In the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial, the use of GPI was restricted to bailout for thrombotic complications. We describe the characteristics and outcomes of patients requiring bailout GPI compared to patients not receiving GPIs, with adjustment through propensity-score. A multivariable model was constructed to identify independent correlates associated with bailout GPI use. A total of 380 out of 10,942 patients received GPI (3.5%); GPI patients were younger, more frequently male, more likely to present with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and less frequently treated with cangrelor. At 48 h, GPI patients experienced higher rates of the primary composite outcome of death, myocardial infarction, ischemia-driven revascularization, or stent thrombosis (ST) (19.2% vs 4.8%; adjusted OR: 5.65(4.08, 7.82), p < 0.0001) and a higher rate of GUSTO severe or moderate bleeding (2.6% vs 0.4% adjusted OR: 4.90 (1.98, 12.18), p = 0.0006) compared with non GPI patients. Independent correlates of GPI use were STEMI, use of unfractionated heparin, drug-eluting stents and longer procedure duration. Conclusions: In a large contemporary trial, patients receiving bailout GPI for thrombotic complications of PCI experienced very high risks of both ischemic and bleeding complications, suggesting that prevention of periprocedural complications rather than bailout GPI may be preferable.

"Airflow limitation and survival after surgery for non-small cell lung cancer: Results from a systematic review and lung cancer screening trial (NLST-ACRIN sub-study)",2019,"Objective: Lung cancer remains the single greatest cause of cancer mortality where surgery for early stage non-small cell lung cancer achieves the greatest survival. While there is growing optimism for better outcomes with screening using annual computed tomography, the impact of co-existing airflow limitation on survival remains unknown. To compare survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients undergoing surgery stratified according to the presence or absence of pre-surgery airflow limitation. Materials and Methods: We undertook a systematic literature search of non-screen lung cancer that encompassed studies reported between January 1946 and January 2017. Full-text articles were identified following eligibility scoring, with data extracted and analysed using a standardised analytical method (PRISMA). The results of this systematic review in non-screen lung cancers were compared to real-world results from a lung cancer screening cohort (N = 10,054), where outcomes following surgery could be compared after stratification according to pre-surgery airflow limitation. Results: In the systematic review, 6899 subjects were included from 10 studies; 7 were retrospective, 3 were prospective. Overall survival was 950 (44%) in 2144 people with COPD and 2597 (55%) from 4755 controls (unadjusted P value &lt;0.001). However, the overall meta-analysed random effects odds ratio for overall survival (N = 10) and 5-year survival (N = 4) comparing those with and without COPD was 0.91 (95% CI = 0.84–1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI = 0.79–1.24) respectively. There were no signs of significant heterogeneity (I2 = 19.1%, P = 0.27) nor publication bias as assessed by funnel plot and Egger's test (P = 0.19). In the lung cancer screening sub-study of 10,054 screening participants we found no difference in 5-year survival in those with and without airflow limitation (84% and 81% respectively, P = 0.64). Conclusion: Survival after surgery for non-small cell lung cancer is comparable between those with and without spirometry evidence of airflow limitation. This finding was replicated in lung cancer diagnosed during screening. ? 2019","airflow; Article; cancer mortality; cancer screening; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chronic obstructive lung disease; disease severity; early cancer; human; lung function; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; prevalence; priority journal; spirometry; survival rate; systematic review"
"Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 4 (FGFR4) Selective Inhibitors as Hepatocellular Carcinoma Therapy: Advances and Prospects",2019,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a lethal disease with limited therapeutic options and a particularly poor prognosis. Aberrant fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) signaling through fibroblast growth factor receptor 4 (FGFR4) has been identified as an oncogenic driver for a subset of patients with HCC. FGFR4 is therefore a promising target for the treatment of HCC harboring aberrant FGF19-FGFR4 signaling, and several FGFR4 inhibitors have advanced to clinical trial. In this review, we summarize the latest developments in FGFR4 inhibitors, including the known pharmacophores, their binding mode, selectivity, and clinical implications, as well as the optimization strategy of introducing an acrylamide into a known pan-FGFR inhibitor targeting Cys552 of FGFR4 to provide selective covalent FGFR4 inhibitors. ? 2018 American Chemical Society.","acrylamide; amino acid; aminopyrazole; aminopyrimidine; azd 4547; blu 554; blu 9931; dipyridylamine; erdafitinib; fibroblast growth factor 19; fibroblast growth factor receptor 4; h 3b 6527; h3b 6527; infigratinib; ly 2874455; ponatinib; prn 1371; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; roblitinib; unclassified drug; cell function; chemical structure; human; hydrogen bond; liver cell carcinoma; nonhuman; pharmacophore; Review; signal transduction"
"Surgical techniques in the management of rectal cancer: a modified Delphi method by colorectal surgeons in Australia and New Zealand",2019,"Background: Technological developments have allowed advances in minimally invasive techniques for total mesorectal excision such as laparoscopy, robotics, and transanal surgery. There remains an ongoing debate about the safety, benefits, and appropriate clinical scenarios for which each technique is employed. The aim of this study was to provide a panel of expert opinion on the role of each surgical technique currently available in the management of rectal cancer using a modified Delphi method. Methods: Surveys were designed to explore the key patient- and tumor-related factors including clinical scenarios for determining a surgeon’s choice of surgical technique. Results: Open surgery was favoured in obese patients with an extra-peritoneal tumor and a positive circumferential resection margin (CRM) or T4 tumor when a restorative resection was planned. Laparoscopy was favoured in non-obese males and females, in both intra- and extra-peritoneal tumors with a clear CRM. Robotic surgery was most commonly offered to obese patients when the CRM was clear and if an abdominoperineal resection was planned. Transanal total mesorectal excision (taTME) was preferred in male patients with a mid or low rectal cancer, particularly when obese. Transanal endoscopic microsurgery/transanal minimally invasive surgery local excision was only offered to frail patients with small, early stage tumors. Conclusions: All surgical techniques for rectal cancer dissection have a role and may be considered appropriate. Some techniques have advantages over others in certain clinical situations, and the best outcomes may be achieved by considering all options before applying an individualised approach to each clinical situation. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",""
"Glycemic control through pharmaceutical care: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",2019,"Objectives: To evaluate the effect of pharmaceutical care (PC) on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Methods: A systematic search of literature was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. RCTs published in English between January 2011 and November 2015 were identified using nine electronic databases: MEDLINE, International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (IPA), EMBASE, Scopus, Science Direct, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Springer Link, and Google Scholar. Studies were included if they outlined a pharmaceutical care intervention conducted by pharmacists alone or in collaboration with other health care professional(s). The studies were identified and data was extracted independently by two reviewers. The meta-analysis was conducted by using RevMan version 5.3. A random-effects model was used to calculate the standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval in glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1 C ) levels. Key findings: Thirteen RCTs outlining PC interventions in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients (n?=?1828) were included. The interventions included care plan development, medication reviews, patient education and counselling of patients with follow-up. All RCTs reported statistically significant reductions in HbA1c in the intervention group (SMD?=??0.97; 95% CI ?1.21 to ?0.73; P?=?0.00001) as compared to the control group. Significant heterogeneity in SMD (χ 2 ?=?68.96) was observed. Conclusions: The findings suggest that PC interventions are effective (at least in short-term follow-up in hospital setting) in reducing HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Pharmacists, working alone or in collaboration with other health professionals have significant impact on improving the health status of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. ? 2019 Royal Pharmaceutical Society","hemoglobin A1c; clinical outcome; counseling; exercise; follow up; glycemic control; human; lifestyle modification; meta analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; patient care planning; patient education; pharmaceutical care; priority journal; Review; self monitoring; systematic review; training"
"Activating a Community: An Agent-Based Model of Romp & Chomp, a Whole-of-Community Childhood Obesity Intervention",2019,"Objective: Successful whole-of-community childhood obesity prevention interventions tend to involve community stakeholders in spreading knowledge about and engagement with obesity prevention efforts through the community. This process is referred to by the authors as stakeholder-driven community diffusion (SDCD). This study uses an agent-based model in conjunction with intervention data to increase understanding of how SDCD operates. Methods: This agent-based model retrospectively simulated SDCD during Romp & Chomp, a 4-year whole-of-community childhood obesity prevention intervention in Victoria, Australia. Stakeholder survey data, intervention records, and expert estimates were used to parameterize the model. Model output was evaluated against criteria derived from empirical data and experts’ estimates of the magnitude and timing of community knowledge and engagement change. Results: The model was able to produce outputs that met the evaluation criteria: increases in simulated community knowledge and engagement driven by SDCD closely matched expert estimates of magnitude and timing. Conclusions: Strong suggestive evidence was found in support of a hypothesis that SDCD was a key driver of the success of the Romp & Chomp intervention. Model exploration also provided additional insights about these processes (including where additional data collection might prove most beneficial), as well as implications for the design and implementation of future interventions. ? 2019 The Obesity Society","Article; Australia; awareness; childhood obesity; community care; health survey; human; medical expert; medical record; retrospective study; social interaction; social network; stakeholder driven community diffusion; stakeholder engagement"
"The measurement of tibial acceleration in runners—A review of the factors that can affect tibial acceleration during running and evidence-based guidelines for its use",2019,"Background: Impact loading in runners, assessed by the measurement of tibial acceleration, has attracted substantial research attention. Due to potential injury links, particularly tibial fatigue fractures, tibial acceleration is also used as a clinical monitoring metric. There are contributing factors and potential limitations that must be considered before widespread implementation. Aim: The objective of this review is to update current knowledge of the measurement of tibial acceleration in runners and to provide recommendations for those intending on using this measurement device in research or clinical practice. Methods: Literature relating to the measurement of tibial acceleration in steady-state running was searched. A narrative approach synthesised the information from papers written in English. A range of literature was identified documenting the selection and placement of accelerometers, the analysis of data, and the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Results and discussion: Tibial acceleration is a proxy measurement for the impact forces experienced at the tibia commonly used by clinicians and researchers. There is an assumption that this measure is related to bone stress and strain, however this is yet to be proven. Multi-axis devices should be secured firmly to the tibia to limit movement relative to the underlying bone and enable quantification of all components of acceleration. Additional frequency analyses could be useful to provide a more thorough characterisation of the signal. Conclusions: Tibial accelerations are clearly affected by running technique, running velocity, lower extremity stiffness, as well as surface and footwear compliance. The interrelationships between muscle pre-activation and fatigue, stiffness, effective mass and tibial acceleration still require further investigation, as well as how changes in these variables impact on injury risk. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","acceleration; clinical practice; human; joint; kinematics; practice guideline; priority journal; Review; runner; running; stress fracture; stride length; stride rate; systematic review; tibia; walking parameters; acceleration; accelerometry; adult; biomechanics; evidence based medicine; female; male; physiology; practice guideline; procedures; running; tibia; Acceleration; Accelerometry; Adult; Biomechanical Phenomena; Evidence-Based Medicine; Female; Humans; Male; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Running; Tibia"
"A Multicountry Comparison of Real-World Management and Outcomes of Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy: Fight Retinal Blindness! Cohort",2019,"Purpose: To compare the 12-month real-world visual and disease activity outcomes of eyes with polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) treated with a combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections (combination group) versus those eyes treated with anti-VEGF monotherapy alone with rescue PDT being used as required (monotherapy group). Design: Database comparative observational study. Participants: Eyes with PCV as graded in the Fight Retinal Blindness! database from Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, and Switzerland. Methods: Clinical information from a multisite, international registry of neovascular age-related macular degeneration was analyzed with an intention-to-treat approach. Main Outcome Measures: Primary outcome measure was the change in visual acuity in logMAR letters over 12 months between the two groups analyzed with intention-to-treat approach. Results: Forty-one and 152 eyes received combination therapy and anti-VEGF monotherapy, respectively. All anti-VEGF agents were pooled, and bevacizumab represented 66.1% of injections administered. The adjusted mean change in visual acuity between the combination group and monotherapy group at 12 months was +16.9 letters (95% confidence interval [CI], 10.6–23.3 letters) and +8.2 letters (95% CI, 5.2–11.3 letters), respectively (P = 0.02). Proportion of inactive lesions and mean time to inactivity was 85.3% and 80.7 days (95% CI, 62.8–98.5 days), respectively, in the combination group compared with 76.8% and 150.4 days (95% CI, 132.8–168.0 days), respectively, in the monotherapy group (P = 0.01). The mean number of injections of anti-VEGF agent between the combination and monotherapy groups was 4.3 injections (95% CI, 3.6–5.2 injections) and 6.4 injections (95% CI, 5.9–6.9 injections), respectively (P = 0.01). Conclusions: The real-world outcomes for treatment of PCV showed larger gains in vision, higher proportion of inactive lesions, quicker time to inactivity, and fewer injections administered in the combination group compared with the monotherapy group. These findings are consistent with current evidence reporting the advantages of combination therapy for PCV. ? 2018 American Academy of Ophthalmology","aflibercept; bevacizumab; ranibizumab; age related macular degeneration; aged; Article; blindness; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; follow up; human; low level laser therapy; major clinical study; male; observational study; photodynamic therapy; physician; polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; priority journal; retina angiography"
"The degree of aminoacidemia after dairy protein ingestion does not modulate the postexercise anabolic response in young men: A randomized controlled trial",2019,"Background: Resistance exercise and dietary protein stimulate muscle protein synthesis (MPS). The rate at which proteins are digested and absorbed into circulation alters peak plasma amino acid concentrations and may modulate postexercise MPS. A novel mineral modified milk protein concentrate (mMPC), with identical amino acid composition to standard milk protein concentrate (MPC), was formulated to induce rapid aminoacidemia. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether rapid aminoacidemia and greater peak essential amino acid (EAA) concentrations induced by mMPC would stimulate greater postresistance exercise MPS, anabolic signaling, and ribosome biogenesis compared to standard dairy proteins, which induce a small but sustained plasma essential aminoacidemia. Methods: Thirty healthy young men (22.5 ± 3.0 y; BMI 23.8 ± 2.7 kg/m2) received primed constant infusions of l-[ring-13C6]-phenylalanine and completed 3 sets of leg presses and leg extensions at 80% of 1 repetition. Afterwards, participants were randomly assigned in a double-blind fashion to consume 25 g mMPC, MPC, or calcium caseinate (CAS). Vastus lateralis biopsies were collected at rest, and 2 and 4 h post exercise. Results: Plasma EAA concentrations, including leucine, were 19.2-26.6% greater in the mMPC group 45-90 min post ingestion than in MPC and CAS groups (P &lt; 0.001). Myofibrillar fractional synthetic rate from baseline to 4 h was increased by 82.6 ± 64.8%, 137.8 ± 72.1%, and 140.6 ± 52.4% in the MPC, mMPC, and CAS groups, respectively, with no difference between groups (P = 0.548). Phosphorylation of anabolic signaling targets (P70S6KThr389, P70S6KThr421/Ser424, RPS6Ser235/236, RPS6Ser240/244, P90RSKSer380, 4EBP1) were elevated by &lt;3-fold at both 2 and 4 h post exercise in all groups (P &lt; 0.05). Conclusions: The amplitude of plasma leucine and EAA concentrations does not modulate the anabolic response to resistance exercise after ingestion of 25 g dairy protein in young men.

"Adiposity and risk of decline in glomerular filtration rate: Meta-analysis of individual participant data in a global consortium",2019,"Objective To evaluate the associations between adiposity measures (body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio) with decline in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and with all cause mortality. Design Individual participant data meta-analysis. Setting Cohorts from 40 countries with data collected between 1970 and 2017. Participants Adults in 39 general population cohorts (n=5 459 014), of which 21 (n=594 496) had data on waist circumference; six cohorts with high cardiovascular risk (n=84 417); and 18 cohorts with chronic kidney disease (n=91 607). Main outcome measures GFR decline (estimated GFR decline ?40%, initiation of kidney replacement therapy or estimated GFR <10 mL/min/1.73 m 2) and all cause mortality. Results Over a mean follow-up of eight years, 246 607 (5.6%) individuals in the general population cohorts had GFR decline (18 118 (0.4%) end stage kidney disease events) and 782 329 (14.7%) died. Adjusting for age, sex, race, and current smoking, the hazard ratios for GFR decline comparing body mass indices 30, 35, and 40 with body mass index 25 were 1.18 (95% confidence interval 1.09 to 1.27), 1.69 (1.51 to 1.89), and 2.02 (1.80 to 2.27), respectively. Results were similar in all subgroups of estimated GFR. Associations weakened after adjustment for additional comorbidities, with respective hazard ratios of 1.03 (0.95 to 1.11), 1.28 (1.14 to 1.44), and 1.46 (1.28 to 1.67). The association between body mass index and death was J shaped, with the lowest risk at body mass index of 25. In the cohorts with high cardiovascular risk and chronic kidney disease (mean follow-up of six and four years, respectively), risk associations between higher body mass index and GFR decline were weaker than in the general population, and the association between body mass index and death was also J shaped, with the lowest risk between body mass index 25 and 30. In all cohort types, associations between higher waist circumference and higher waist-to-height ratio with GFR decline were similar to that of body mass index; however, increased risk of death was not associated with lower waist circumference or waist-to-height ratio, as was seen with body mass index. Conclusions Elevated body mass index, waist circumference, and waist-to-height ratio are independent risk factors for GFR decline and death in individuals who have normal or reduced levels of estimated GFR. ?

However, the effect of microcirculation variation on the vascular system is unclear. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies to quantify associations of retinal microvascular caliber (arteriolar, venular caliber, arteriole-to-venule ratio) and preclinical CV measures (large arterial function and structure). Methods: We identified studies in MEDLINE, EMBASE, and PubMed (1946 to March 2018) studying (a) general population samples and (b) patients with cardiometabolic disease. Study-specific correlation estimates were combined into meta-analysis where possible. Results: Of 1294 studies identified, 26 met inclusion criteria (general population 16, patients 10), of which five studies were included in meta-analysis. Most studied middle-aged adults cross-sectionally, with one childhood study. Large arterial function and structure were predominantly assessed by pulse wave velocity and carotid intima-media thickness, respectively. Only arteriolar caliber was consistently associated with arterial function and structure, with stronger associations observed in cardiometabolic patients. Narrower (worse) arteriolar caliber was associated with faster (poorer) pulse wave velocity (correlation coefficient (r) ?0.17, 95% CI ?0.25 to ?0.10) and greater (poorer) intima-media thickness (r ?0.05, 95%CI ?0.09 to ?0.02) across all adult participants. Conclusions: Retinal arteriolar, but not venular caliber, was modestly associated with large arterial function and weakly associated with large arterial structure, with stronger evidence in patients with cardiometabolic disease. This suggests that preclinical changes in large arteries and the microcirculation have some shared but mainly unique pathways to associate with cardiovascular disease. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","aortic calcification; arterial wall thickness; artery compliance; coronary artery obstruction; diabetes mellitus; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; microcirculation; priority journal; pulse wave; retina artery; retinal arteriole; Review; study design; systematic review; venule"
"Hybrid nanocomposite curcumin-capped gold nanoparticle-reduced graphene oxide: Antioxidant potency and selective cancer cytotoxicity",2019,"Nanotechnology-based antioxidants and therapeutic agents are believed to be the next generation tools to face the ever-increasing cancer mortality rates. Graphene stands as a preferred nano-therapeutic template, due to the advanced properties and cellular interaction mechanisms. Nevertheless, majority of graphene-based composites suffer from hindered development as efficient cancer therapeutics. Recent nano-toxicology reviews and recommendations emphasize on the preliminary synthetic stages as a crucial element in driving successful applications results. In this study, we present an integrated, green, one-pot hybridization of target-suited raw materials into curcumin-capped gold nanoparticle-conjugated reduced graphene oxide (CAG) nanocomposite, as a prominent anti-oxidant and anticancer agent. Distinct from previous studies, the beneficial attributes of curcumin are employed to their fullest extent, such that they perform dual roles of being a natural reducing agent and possessing antioxidant anti-cancer functional moiety. The proposed novel green synthesis approach secured an enhanced structure with dispersed homogenous AuNPs (15.62 ± 4.04 nm) anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, surpassing other traditional chemical reductants. On the other hand, safe, non-toxic CAG elevates biological activity and supports biocompatibility. Free radical DPPH inhibition assay revealed CAG antioxidant potential with IC50(324.1 ± 1.8%) value reduced by half compared to that of traditional citrate-rGO-AuNP nanocomposite (612.1 ± 10.1%), which confirms the amplified multi-potent antioxidant activity. Human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29 and SW-948) showed concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity for CAG, as determined by optical microscopy images and WST-8 assay, with relatively low IC50values (~100 μg/ml), while preserving biocompatibility towards normal human colon (CCD-841) and liver cells (WRL-68), with high selectivity indices ( 2.0) at all tested time points. Collectively, our results demonstrate effective green synthesis of CAG nanocomposite, free of additional stabilizing agents, and its bioactivity as an antioxidant and selective anti-colon cancer agent. ? 2019 Al-Ani et al.

"The therapist experience of internet delivered CBT for problem gambling: Service integration considerations",2019,"Introduction: Countries with legalized gambling offer a network of government funded face-to-face therapy, but usage of this expertise is on the decline. One way to address this issue is to recruit therapists from existing services whereby they provide guidance for the delivery of internet delivered CBT. Objective: To explore the experiences and perceptions of therapists supporting guided online cognitive–behavioural therapy. Methods: Interviewees were a sub-sample of therapists from a randomised trial that investigated the relative efficacy of online guided self-directed versus pure self-directed interventions in Australia. Results: In-person, semi-structured interviews with seven service providers were completed, and thematic content analysis identified five themes which related to: participant suitability and screening (e.g., motivation, computer literacy and access); program content and modality acceptability (e.g., amount of content, look and feel); participant information and management (e.g., program engagement and progression); email communication (e.g., use of templates, appointments, rapport building), and; ongoing service integration (e.g., infrastructure, confidence in product). Overall experiences and perceptions of therapists were positive, notwithstanding barriers concerning assessment of participant suitability, participant management systems and low participant engagement. Conclusions: Key themes emphasized the benefits of Internet-based interventions for problem gambling, and suggested several areas for improvement. Results should inform the development of future treatments to enable flexible tailoring of interventions to individuals. ? 2019 The Authors","adult; Article; Australia; cognitive behavioral therapy; content analysis; controlled study; e-mail; female; human; Internet; interpersonal communication; major clinical study; male; middle aged; motivation; pathological gambling; priority journal; program acceptability; psychotherapist; psychotherapist attitude; randomized controlled trial (topic); semi structured interview; thematic analysis"
"Carotid artery intima-media thickness, distensibility and elasticity: Population epidemiology and concordance in Australian children aged 11-12 years old and their parents",2019,"Objectives To describe a well-established marker of cardiovascular risk, carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and related measures (artery distensibility and elasticity) in children aged 11-12 years old and mid-life adults, and examine associations within parent-child dyads. Design Cross-sectional study (Child Health CheckPoint), nested within a prospective cohort study, the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Setting Assessment centres in seven Australian major cities and eight selected regional towns, February 2015 to March 2016. Participants Of all participating CheckPoint families (n=1874), 1489 children (50.0% girls) and 1476 parents (86.8% mothers) with carotid IMT data were included. Survey weights and methods were applied to account for LSAC's complex sample design and clustering within postcodes and strata. Outcome measures Ultrasound of the right carotid artery was performed using standardised protocols. Primary outcomes were mean and maximum far-wall carotid IMT, quantified using semiautomated edge detection software. Secondary outcomes were carotid artery distensibility and elasticity. Pearson's correlation coefficients and multivariable linear regression models were used to assess parent-child concordance. Random effects modelling on a subset of ultrasounds (with repeated measurements) was used to assess reliability of the child carotid IMT measure. Results The average mean and maximum child carotid IMT were 0.50 mm (SD 0.06) and 0.58 mm (SD 0.05), respectively. In adults, average mean and maximum carotid IMT were 0.57 mm (SD 0.07) and 0.66 mm (SD 0.10), respectively. Mother-child correlations for mean and maximum carotid IMT were 0.12 (95% CI 0.05 to 0.23) and 0.10 (95% CI 0.03 to 0.21), respectively. For carotid artery distensibility and elasticity, mother-child correlations were 0.19 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.25) and 0.11 (95% CI 0.02 to 0.18), respectively. There was no strong evidence of father-child correlation in any measure. Conclusions We provide Australian values for carotid vascular measures and report a modest mother-child concordance. Both genetic and environmental exposures are likely to contribute to carotid IMT. ? 2019 Author(s).","adult; arterial wall thickness; artery compliance; article; Australian; child; cohort analysis; correlation coefficient; cross-sectional study; elasticity; environmental exposure; father; female; girl; human; human tissue; linear regression analysis; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; mother; outcome assessment; prospective study; reliability; school child; software; ultrasound; inheritance; reference value"
"Brief Report. A qualitative study of maternal mental health services in New Zealand: Perspectives of M?ori and Pacific mothers and midwives",2019,"Objectives: Suicide is the leading cause of maternal death in New Zealand particularly amongst M?ori and Pacific. We explored current maternal mental health (MMH) screening practices and supports. Methods: Qualitative research included interviews and focus groups with maternity carers and mothers of M?ori and Pacific descent. Thematic analysis used a general inductive approach. Results: Both mothers and carers reported that MMH screening is ad hoc and discussed multilevel barriers that hamper screening and access to supports. Conclusion: There are gaps in MMH services, and service improvements need to be targeted at patient, provider, and systems levels. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",""
"A longitudinal study of antenatal and perinatal risk factors in early childhood cognition: Evidence from Growing Up in New Zealand",2019,"Background: Poor maternal health, disadvantageous exposures during pregnancy and unfavourable perinatal events are associated with adverse trajectories in offspring cognitive development. Aim: To examine longitudinal associations between antenatal maternal, perinatal and maternal health characteristics and children's early cognitive development across executive control, motor ability and receptive language domains. Study design, subjects and outcome measures: Analyses comprised interview and observational data from 4587 children and their mothers enrolled in the longitudinal Growing Up in New Zealand cohort study. Children's executive control (Luria hand clap task), motor skills (mothers' report) and receptive language ability (Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test) were assessed at age 4.5 years. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted, controlling for sociodemographic factors. Results: Smoking pre- and during pregnancy, no folate intake during first trimester and low birth weight were risk factors for poorer executive control. Perceived stress during pregnancy, no folate intake during first trimester and low birth weight were all risk factors for poorer motor ability. Smoking pre-pregnancy, antenatal anxiety and no folate intake during first trimester were risk factors for poorer receptive language ability. Conclusion: Adverse ante- and perinatal environments are associated with poorer executive control, motor and receptive language abilities in early childhood. Improving maternal education and support especially for more disadvantaged mothers during pregnancy may reduce the potential deleterious impact of adverse ante- and perinatal conditions on children's early cognition. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","folic acid; adult; Article; birth weight; child; child development; cognitive development; cohort analysis; controlled study; demography; executive function; female; first trimester pregnancy; health; human; language ability; logistic regression analysis; longitudinal study; Luria-Nebraska neuropsychological battery; major clinical study; maternal stress; maternal welfare; motor performance; nonhuman; observational study; passive smoking; Peabody picture vocabulary test; perinatal care; prenatal period; risk factor; smoking; third trimester pregnancy; child development; cognition; folic acid deficiency; infant; language; male; mental stress; motor performance; New Zealand; newborn; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; preschool child; Adult; Child Development; Child, Preschool; Cognition; Female; Folic Acid Deficiency; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Language; Male; Motor Skills; New Zealand; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Stress, Psychological; Tobacco Smoking"

"Tracking spending on malaria by source in 106 countries, 2000–16: an economic modelling study",2019,"Background: Sustaining achievements in malaria control and making progress toward malaria elimination requires coordinated funding. We estimated domestic malaria spending by source in 106 countries that were malaria-endemic in 2000–16 or became malaria-free after 2000. Methods: We collected 36 038 datapoints reporting government, out-of-pocket (OOP), and prepaid private malaria spending, as well as malaria treatment-seeking, costs of patient care, and drug prices. We estimated government spending on patient care for malaria, which was added to government spending by national malaria control programmes. For OOP malaria spending, we used data reported in National Health Accounts and estimated OOP spending on treatment. Spatiotemporal Gaussian process regression was used to ensure estimates were complete and comparable across time and to generate uncertainty. Findings: In 2016, US$4·3 billion (95% uncertainty interval [UI] 4·2–4·4) was spent on malaria worldwide, an 8·5% (95% UI 8·1–8·9) per year increase over spending in 2000. Since 2000, OOP spending increased 3·8% (3·3–4·2) per year, amounting to $556 million (487–634) or 13·0% (11·6–14·5) of all malaria spending in 2016. Governments spent $1·2 billion (1·1–1·3) or 28·2% (27·1–29·3) of all malaria spending in 2016, increasing 4·0% annually since 2000. The source of malaria spending varied depending on whether countries were in the malaria control or elimination stage. Interpretation: Tracking global malaria spending provides insight into how far the world is from reaching the malaria funding target of $6·6 billion annually by 2020. Because most countries with a high burden of malaria are low income or lower-middle income, mobilising additional government resources for malaria might be challenging.

"The potential impact of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in lung cancer screening: implications for the screening clinic",2019,"Introduction: Following the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), lung cancer screening is now recommended in the United States.?However, post-hoc analyses of the NLST suggest that reducing lung cancer mortality through screening is highly dependent on the underlying characteristics of the screening participants, in particular, the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Areas covered: In this review, we outline how outcomes in lung cancer screening are significantly affected by the presence of airflow limitation, as caused by COPD, and how this might impact the assessment of eligible smokers in a lung cancer screening clinic. Expert opinion: There is growing evidence showing that CT-based screening for lung cancer reduces lung cancer mortality. The benefits of screening exceed those seen in the NLST when screening is carried out in lower risk populations, for a longer duration, and when outcomes are compared with usual care control cohorts. In this article, we review data from a post-hoc analysis of the NLST. We suggest that whilst worsened airflow limitation is associated with greater lung cancer risk, there is also more aggressive lung cancer, reduced lung cancer operability, and for advanced COPD, reduced benefits from screening. We advocate an ’outcomes-based’ approach to screening over a ‘risk-based’ approach. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","biological marker; airflow; cancer risk; cancer screening; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; human; lung cancer; Review; shared decision making; smoking; x-ray computed tomography"
"Neonatal amygdalae and hippocampi are influenced by genotype and prenatal environment, and reflected in the neonatal DNA methylome",2019,"The amygdala and hippocampus undergo rapid development in early life. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to the establishment of their developmental trajectories has yet to be examined. We performed imaging on neonates and examined how the observed variation in volume and microstructure of the amygdala and hippocampus varied by genotype, and compared with prenatal maternal mental health and socioeconomic status. Gene × Environment models outcompeted models containing genotype or environment only to best explain the majority of measures but some, especially of the amygdaloid microstructure, were best explained by genotype only. Models including DNA methylation measured in the neonate umbilical cords outcompeted the Gene and Gene × Environment models for the majority of amygdaloid measures and minority of hippocampal measures. This study identified brain region-specific gene networks associated with individual differences in fetal brain development. In particular, genetic and epigenetic variation within CUX1 was highlighted. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society","amygdala; article; brain development; brain region; controlled study; diffusion tensor imaging; DNA methylation; epigenetics; female; fetus brain; genotype; hippocampus; human; human experiment; mental health; newborn; prenatal exposure; social status; umbilical cord"

"Maternal undernutrition results in altered renal pro-inflammatory gene expression concomitant with hypertension in adult male offspring that is ameliorated following pre-weaning growth hormone treatment",2019,"An adverse early life environment is associated with increased cardiovascular disease in offspring. Work in animal models has shown that maternal undernutrition (UN) during pregnancy leads to hypertension in adult offspring, with effects thought to be mediated in part via altered renal function. We have previously shown that growth hormone (GH) treatment of UN offspring during the pre-weaning period can prevent the later development of cardiometabolic disorders. However, the mechanistic basis for these observations is not well defined. The present study examined the impact of GH treatment on renal inflammatory markers in adult male offspring as a potential mediator of these reversal effects. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a chow diet fed ad libitum (CON) or at 50% of CON intake (UN) during pregnancy. All dams were fed the chow diet ad libitum during lactation. CON and UN pups received saline (CON-S/UN-S) or GH (2.5 μg/g/day; CON-GH/UN-GH) from postnatal day 3 until weaning (p21). Post-weaning males were fed a standard chow diet for the remainder of the study (150 days). Histological analysis was performed to examine renal morphological characteristics, and gene expression of inflammatory and vascular markers were assessed. There was evidence of renal hypotrophy and reduced nephron number in the UN-S group. Tumour necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), intercellular adhesion molecular-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 gene expression was increased in UN-S offspring and normalized in the UN-GH group. These findings indicate that pre-weaning GH treatment has the potential to normalize some of the adverse renal and cardiovascular sequelae that arise as a consequence of poor maternal nutrition. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press and the International Society for Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.",""
"A simple ex vivo bioassay for 5-FU transport into healthy buccal mucosal cells",2019,"Purpose: Fluorouracil (5-FU), a chemotherapeutic agent widely used in the treatment of numerous common malignancies, causes oral mucositis in a proportion of patients. The contribution of drug transport processes to the development of this toxicity is currently unknown. This work aimed to establish and optimise a simple phenotyping assay for 5-FU uptake into primary buccal mucosal cells (BMC). Methods: The uptake kinetics of radiolabelled 5-FU were determined in pooled BMC freshly collected from healthy volunteers. The inter- and intra-individual variability in 5-FU uptake was then assessed across a cohort that included both healthy volunteers and cancer patients. Results: 5-FU uptake into pooled primary BMC was both time and concentration dependent. An Eadie–Hofstee analysis suggested two components; a high-affinity (KM = 3.3??M) low-capacity (VMAX = 57.8?pmol?min?1?105 viable cells?1) transporter, and a high-capacity (VMAX = 1230?pmol?min?1?105 viable cells?1) low-affinity (KM = 3932??M) transporter. There was 180-fold variation in the rate of 5-FU uptake into BMC (0.10–17.86?pmol?min?1?105 viable cells?1) across the 34 subjects (healthy participants N = 24, cancer patients N = 10). Notably, retesting of a subset of these participants (N = 16) multiple times over a period of up to 140?days demonstrated poor stability of the uptake phenotype within individuals. Conclusion: The uptake of 5-FU into healthy oral mucosal cells is a highly variable process facilitated by membrane transporters at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. This bioassay is simple, minimally invasive, and suitable for phenotypic analysis of drug transport in healthy primary cells. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","fluorouracil; adult; aged; Article; bioassay; buccal mucosa; cancer patient; clinical article; concentration response; drug uptake; ex vivo study; female; human; human cell; isotope labeling; male; maximum concentration; Michaelis Menten kinetics; mucosa cell; normal human; phenotype; primary cell; priority journal; substrate concentration; viable cell count"
"Self-harm in adults: A comparison between the middle-aged and the elderly",2019,"AIM: In New Zealand, men aged 45-49 years and 85 years and above have one of the highest suicide rates. As the population in New Zealand ages, it is anticipated that the absolute number of late-life suicides will rise. Self-harm is one of the better predictors of future suicide. The aims of this study are to: (i) characterise middle-aged (45-64 years) and older-aged people (65+ years) who have self-harmed; and (ii) determine whether there are differences between the two age groups. METHOD: Clinical data were retrospectively collected on people aged 45+ years who presented with a self-harm attempt to a large emergency department in New Zealand from 2010 to 2013. Further clinical information for the 12-month period following their presentation was also collected. RESULTS: Three hundred and seventy-one middle-aged (56.6% female) and 49 older-aged (38.8% female) people presented with a total of 513 and 56 self-harm attempts respectively during the study period. The older-aged group was more likely to report physical illness as a stressor (p=0.001), have a history of depression (p<0.0001) and be diagnosed with depression at the time of their attempt (p<0.0001). Suicidal intent was more common among the older-aged people who have self-harmed (p=0.004), and they had lower survival rates in the 12 months after their self-harm attempt (risk ratio=7.5; 95% CI=3.1 to 18.1). CONCLUSION: The significant differences between older-aged and middle-aged people who have self-harmed highlights the need for age-specific suicide interventions, with particular focus on addressing physical illness and depression in older-aged people. ?

"Care coordination experiences of people with traumatic brain injury and their family members in the 4-years after injury: a qualitative analysis",2019,"Title: Care coordination experiences of people with traumatic brain injury and their family members 4-years after injury: A qualitative analysis. Aim: To explore experiences of care coordination in the first 4-years after severe traumatic brain injury (TBI). Methods: A qualitative study nested within a population-based longitudinal cohort study. Eighteen semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted 48-months post-injury with six adults living with severe TBI and the family members of 12 other adults living with severe TBI. Participants were identified through purposive sampling from the Victorian State Trauma Registry. A thematic analysis was undertaken. Results: No person with TBI or their family member reported a case manager or care coordinator were involved in assisting with all aspects of their care. Many people with severe TBI experienced ineffective care coordination resulting in difficulty accessing services, variable quality in the timing, efficiency and appropriateness of services, an absence of regular progress evaluations and collaboratively formulated long-term plans. Some family members attempted to fill gaps in care, often without success. In contrast, effective care coordination was reported by one family member who advocated for services, closely monitored their relative, and effectively facilitated communication between services providers. Conclusion: Given the high cost, complexity and long-term nature of TBI recovery, more effective care coordination is required to consistently meet the needs of people with severe TBI. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","adult; Article; care coordinator; case manager; clinical article; cohort analysis; coordination; family; female; human; injury severity; long term care; longitudinal study; male; qualitative analysis; qualitative research; semi structured interview; telephone interview; traumatic brain injury"

"The Role of Religion in Suicidal Behavior, Attitudes and Psychological Distress Among University Students: A Multinational Study",2019,"The purpose of this study was to determine the associations between religion, suicidal behavior, attitudes and psychological distress in 5572 students from 12 countries by means of a self-report questionnaire. Our results showed that an affiliation with Islam was associated with reduced risk for suicide ideation, however affiliating with Orthodox Christianity and no religion was related to increased risk for suicide ideation. While affiliating with Buddhism, Catholic religion and no religion was associated with lowered risk for attempting suicide, affiliation with Islam was related to heightened risk for attempting suicide. Affiliation with Hinduism, Orthodox Christianity, Catholicism, other religions and with no religion was associated with decreased risk for psychological distress but those reported affiliating with Islam evinced greater risk for psychological distress. The associations of the strength of religious belief to suicidal ideation and attempts were in the expected direction for most but had a positive relation in respondents affiliating with Catholicism and other religions. Students reporting affiliation with Islam, the Christian Orthodox religion and Buddhism were the least accepting of suicide but they displayed a more confronting interpersonal style to an imagined peer with a suicidal decision. It was concluded that the protective function of religion in educated segments of populations (university students) and in university students residing in Muslim countries where freedom from religion is restricted or religion is normative and/or compulsory is likely to be limited. Our findings suggest that public policies supporting religious freedom may augment the protective function of religion against suicide and psychological distress. ?

"Efficacy and Safety of Ceritinib (450 mg/d or 600 mg/d) With Food Versus 750-mg/d Fasted in Patients With ALK Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (ALK)–Positive NSCLC: Primary Efficacy Results From the ASCEND-8 Study",2019,"Introduction: In an earlier report of the ASCEND-8 study (open-label, phase I, three-arm study, treatment-naive patients and pre-treated patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC), it was shown that ceritinib 450 mg with food had comparable exposure and better gastrointestinal tolerability than 750-mg fasted. Methods: Here, we report efficacy and updated safety data from primary efficacy analysis of the ASCEND-8 study. Key secondary endpoints were overall response rate and duration of response, assessed by blinded independent review committee (BIRC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. Results: In total, 306 patients were randomized to ceritinib 450-mg fed (n = 108) or 600-mg fed (n = 87) or 750-mg fasted (n = 111), of which 304 patients were included in safety analysis and 198 treatment-naive patients (ALK receptor tyrosine kinase [ALK]–positive by immunohistochemistry) were included in the efficacy analysis (450-mg fed [n = 73], 600-mg fed [n = 51], and 750-mg fasted [n = 74]). The BIRC-assessed overall response rate was 78.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 66.9–86.9), 72.5% (95% CI: 58.3–84.1), and 75.7% (95% CI: 64.3–84.9), respectively; and the median duration of response (months) by BIRC was not estimable (NE) (95% CI: 11.2–NE), 20.7 (95% CI: 15.8–NE), and 15.4 (95% CI: 8.3–NE), respectively. Based on the safety analysis (n = 304), the 450-mg fed arm showed the highest median relative dose intensity (100% versus 78.5% versus 83.7%), lowest proportion of patients with dose reductions (24.1% versus 65.1% versus 60.9%), and lowest proportion of patients with gastrointestinal toxicities (75.9% versus 82.6% versus 91.8%).

"Harmony and distress: Humor, culture, and psychological well-being in South Korean organizations",2019,"Humor is a contextual phenomenon that exists in all societies, although the impact of humor may differ across different cultures. The data for this research was collected using an ethnographic-based approach, incorporating participant observation and semi-structured interviews. Based in three different South Korean organizations, this research offered the opportunity to interact in depth with workers of varying ages, genders, hierarchical levels, and organizational roles. Humor styles incorporate both light and dark forms of humor that may be affiliative and self-enhancing or aggressive and detrimental or may contain elements from both styles simultaneously Observations were complimented by 46 in-depth interviews and ad hoc follow-up discussions. This paper adopts a Confucian perspective to understand the perception and use of workplace humor in these South Korean organizations. Confucian philosophy emphasizes the value of formality within society in order to maintain respectful relationships between individuals. We suggest that humor is used in these South Korean workplaces to support traditional Confucian values of harmony and hierarchy, and the changing cultural values in these workplaces influence humor perceptions in complex ways. The Confucian value of harmony maintained through the idea of hierarchy creates pressure for organizational members, to accept and cope with contentious humor in the workplace. In particular, the clash between the need to maintain harmonious relationships in the workplace (through obedience toward superiors) and the desire to reject some types of humor highlights issues for younger organizational members. Internal conflict creates distress for younger employees who may hold more Westernized values and this affects their emotional, psychological well-being. This study presents a cross-cultural perspective to organizational humor, and suggests that humor may not always be a positive experience for organizational members, but instead may create psychological distress in some employees. ? 2019 Kim and Plester.",""
"Establishing the nurse practitioner workforce in rural New Zealand: Barriers and facilitators",2019,"INTRODUCTION: The health sector is facing considerable challenges to meet the health needs of rural communities. Nurse practitioners (NPs) deliver primary health care (PHC) services similar to general practitioner (GP) services, within a healThequity and social justice paradigm. Despite GP workforce deficits, New Zealand has been slow to effectively utilise NPs. AIM: From a larger study exploring the establishment of NP services, this paper reports on the barriers and facilitators to becoming a NP in rural PHC. METHODS: Overall, 13 NPs and 4 NP candidates participated in individual or group interviews. Participants were employed in a variety of PHC settings from six district health boards across New Zealand. Using a scaffold map constructed to show the stages of the pathway from nurse to NP, data were analysed to identify experiences and events that facilitated or were barriers to progress. RESULTS: Experiences varied considerably between participants. Commitment to the development of the NP role in their local areas, including support, advanced clinical opportunities, supervision, funding and NP job opportunities, were critical to progression and success. Existing GP shortages and the desire to improve health outcomes for communities drove nurses to become NPs. DISCUSSION: Implementation of the NP workforce across New Zealand remains ad hoc and inconsistent. While there are pockets of great progress, overall, the health sector has failed to embrace the contribution that NPs can make to PHC service delivery. A national approach is required to develop the NP workforce as a mainstream PHC provider. ? 2019 CSIRO Publishing Journal Compilation.","adult; article; controlled study; disease course; funding; general practitioner; human; interview; New Zealand; nurse practitioner; nursing role; primary health care; rural health; workforce"
"Effect of medical students' values on their clinical decision-making",2019,"Introduction: Personal and professional values of health-care practitioners influence their clinical decisions. Aim: To investigate how medical students' values influence their clinical decisions. Methods: Values of 117 medical students were measured using an instrument we developed, the Healthcare Practitioner Values Scale. Factors that students consider in clinical decision-making were identified in four clinical scenarios using qualitative coding. Differences in values between students who considered given factors in decision-making and students who did not consider the same factors were analysed. Random effects models were used to investigate which differences were explained by variation in the clinical scenarios and factors considered in decision-making. Results: Six factors that students consider in clinical decision-making were identified and grouped into three categories: patient-centred (patient perspective, family and social circumstances); clinical (patient safety, symptoms and treatment efficacy); and situational factors (health-care practitioner self-awareness and service cost). Students who prioritised spirituality placed more emphasis on patient-centred factors, and less emphasis on clinical factors in different scenarios; students who prioritised critical thinking placed less emphasis on patient-centred factors; and students who prioritised capability, professionalism and safety values placed more emphasis on situational factors. Total proportion of variance in value differences explained by factors and clinical scenarios was 25.2% for spirituality and 56.2% for critical thinking. Discussion: Students who prioritise different values consider different factors in their clinical decisions. Spirituality and critical thinking values are more likely to influence students' decision-making approaches than other values. Improving students' awareness of how their own values influence their decisions can help them improve their clinical decision-making. ?

"Risk Factors and Attack Rates of Seasonal Influenza Infection: Results of the Southern Hemisphere Influenza and Vaccine Effectiveness Research and Surveillance (SHIVERS) Seroepidemiologic Cohort Study",2019,"Background. Understanding the attack rate of influenza infection and the proportion who become ill by risk group is key to implementing prevention measures. While population-based studies of antihemagglutinin antibody responses have been described previously, studies examining both antihemagglutinin and antineuraminidase antibodies are lacking. Methods. In 2015, we conducted a seroepidemiologic cohort study of individuals randomly selected from a population in New Zealand. We tested paired sera for hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) or neuraminidase inhibition (NAI) titers for seroconversion. We followed participants weekly and performed influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for those reporting influenza-like illness (ILI). Results. Influenza infection (either HAI or NAI seroconversion) was found in 321 (35% [95% confidence interval, 32%.38%]) of 911 unvaccinated participants, of whom 100 (31%) seroconverted to NAI alone. Young children and Pacific peoples experienced the highest influenza infection attack rates, but overall only a quarter of all infected reported influenza PCR.confirmed ILI, and one-quarter of these sought medical attention. Seroconversion to NAI alone was higher among children aged <5 years vs those aged ?5 years (14% vs 4%; P < .001) and among those with influenza B vs A(H3N2) virus infections (7% vs 0.3%; P < .001). Conclusions. Measurement of antineuraminidase antibodies in addition to antihemagglutinin antibodies may be important in capturing the true influenza infection rates. ? 2018 The Author(s).","virus antibody; virus hemagglutinin; virus sialidase; influenza vaccine; sialidase; adult; aged; antibody titer; Article; child health; cohort analysis; female; flu like syndrome; follow up; human; incidence; influenza A (H3N2); influenza B; influenza vaccination; major clinical study; male; New Zealand; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; risk factor; seasonal influenza; seroconversion; seroepidemiology; adolescent; antibody production; child; hemagglutination inhibition test; immunology; infant; influenza; Influenza A virus (H3N2); middle aged; newborn; preschool child; risk factor; season; seroepidemiology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Antibody Formation; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Male; Middle Aged; Neuraminidase; New Zealand; Risk Factors; Seasons; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Young Adult"
"Homologous recombination DNA repair defects in PALB2-associated breast cancers",2019,"Mono-allelic germline pathogenic variants in the Partner And Localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) gene predispose to a high-risk of breast cancer development, consistent with the role of PALB2 in homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair. Here, we sought to define the repertoire of somatic genetic alterations in PALB2-associated breast cancers (BCs), and whether PALB2-associated BCs display bi-allelic inactivation of PALB2 and/or genomic features of HR-deficiency (HRD). Twenty-four breast cancer patients with pathogenic PALB2 germline mutations were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing (WES, n = 16) or targeted capture massively parallel sequencing (410 cancer genes, n = 8). Somatic genetic alterations, loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the PALB2 wild-type allele, large-scale state transitions (LSTs) and mutational signatures were defined. PALB2-associated BCs were found to be heterogeneous at the genetic level, with PIK3CA (29%), PALB2 (21%), TP53 (21%), and NOTCH3 (17%) being the genes most frequently affected by somatic mutations. Bi-allelic PALB2 inactivation was found in 16 of the 24 cases (67%), either through LOH (n = 11) or second somatic mutations (n = 5) of the wild-type allele. High LST scores were found in all 12 PALB2-associated BCs with bi-allelic PALB2 inactivation sequenced by WES, of which eight displayed the HRD-related mutational signature 3. In addition, bi-allelic inactivation of PALB2 was significantly associated with high LST scores. Our findings suggest that the identification of bi-allelic PALB2 inactivation in PALB2-associated BCs is required for the personalization of HR-directed therapies, such as platinum salts and/or PARP inhibitors, as the vast majority of PALB2-associated BCs without PALB2 bi-allelic inactivation lack genomic features of HRD. ? 2019, The Author(s).","partner and localizer of BRCA2; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer patient; clinical article; female; gene frequency; gene inactivation; germline mutation; heterozygosity loss; human; middle aged; recombination repair; somatic mutation; tumor gene; very elderly; whole exome sequencing; wild type"
"Sleep: Population epidemiology and concordance in Australian children aged 11-12 years and their parents",2019,"Objectives To describe objectively measured sleep characteristics in children aged 11-12 years and in parents and to examine intergenerational concordance of sleep characteristics. Design Population-based cross-sectional study (the Child Health CheckPoint), nested within the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Setting Data were collected between February 2015 and March 2016 across assessment centres in Australian major cities and selected regional towns. Participants Of the participating CheckPoint families (n=1874), sleep data were available for 1261 children (mean age 12 years, 50% girls), 1358 parents (mean age 43.8 years; 88% mothers) and 1077 biological parent-child pairs. Survey weights were applied and statistical methods accounted for the complex sample design, stratification and clustering within postcodes. Outcome measures Parents and children were asked to wear a GENEActive wrist-worn accelerometer for 8 days to collect objective sleep data. Primary outcomes were average sleep duration, onset, offset, day-to-day variability and efficiency. All sleep characteristics were weighted 5:2 to account for weekdays versus weekends. Biological parent-child concordance was quantified using Pearson's correlation coefficients in unadjusted models and regression coefficients in adjusted models. Results The mean sleep duration of parents and children was 501 min (SD 56) and 565 min (SD 44), respectively; the mean sleep onset was 22:42 and 22:02, the mean sleep offset was 07:07 and 07:27, efficiency was 85.4% and 84.1%, and day-to-day variability was 9.9% and 7.4%, respectively. Parent-child correlation for sleep duration was 0.22 (95% CI 0.10 to 0.28), sleep onset was 0.42 (0.19 to 0.46), sleep offset was 0.58 (0.49 to 0.64), day-to-day variability was 0.25 (0.09 to 0.34) and sleep efficiency was 0.23 (0.10 to 0.27). Conclusions These normative values for objective sleep characteristics suggest that, while most parents and children show adequate sleep duration, poor-quality (low efficiency) sleep is common. Parent-child concordance was strongest for sleep onset/offset, most likely reflecting shared environments, and modest for duration, variability and efficiency. ? 2019 Author(s).","adult; Article; Australian; child; child parent relation; cross-sectional study; female; human; longitudinal study; male; mother; observational study; parent; school child; sleep; sleep efficiency; sleep offset; sleep time; sleep variability; stage 1 sleep"
"Drug Policy and the Public Good: a summary of the second edition",2019,"The second edition of Drug Policy and the Public Good presents up-to-date evidence relating to the development of drug policy at local, national and international levels. The book explores both illicit drug use and non-medical use of prescription medications from a public health perspective. The core of the book is a critical review of the scientific evidence in five areas of drug policy: (1) primary prevention programs in schools and other settings; (2) treatment interventions and harm reduction approaches; (3) attempts to control the supply of illicit drugs, including drug interdiction and law enforcement; (4) penal approaches, decriminalization and other alternatives; and (5) control of the legal market through prescription drug regimens. It also discusses the trend towards legalization of some psychoactive substances in some countries and the need for a new approach to drug policy that is evidence-based, realistic and coordinated. The accumulated evidence provides important information about effective and ineffective policies. Shifting the emphasis towards a public health approach should reduce the extent of illicit drug use, prevent the escalation of new epidemics and avoid the unintended consequences arising from the marginalization of drug users through severe criminal penalties. ? 2019 Society for the Study of Addiction",""
"The potential for retronasally delivered olfactory stimuli to assess psychiatric conditions",2019,"Recent research has linked the ability to identify odours to parts of the brain that, when impaired, are associated with mental illness or disease. The link between impaired odour perception and some psychological disorders has led to the suggestion that standardised assessments probing smell be routinely adopted in the clinical environment. Odour tests currently on the market utilise the orthonasal route, though the retronasal route is a viable, but overlooked, alternative. In this study, a flavour delivery system has been developed which quickly dissolves in the buccal cavity, rapidly releasing flavours that reach the olfactory system by the retronasal route. We tested seven different types of retronasal flavour stimuli (peppermint, aniseed, liquorice, coffee, orange, lemon, and valeric acid) on 171 undergraduate and postgraduate university students and related perceptual measures with psychological wellbeing scores. Olfactory measures included odour identification, pleasantness, intensity, and familiarity. Psychological measures of schizotypy (SPQ-B), depression, stress and anxiety (DASS-21), and autism spectrum disorder (RAADS-R) were obtained to represent psychological wellbeing. A battery of hierarchical multiple linear regressions were run to determine the relationships between odour perception and the psychometric measures. After controlling for age and gender, significant negative associations were found between odour identification and the stress (β = ?.347, p <.001), anxiety (β = ?.376, p <.001), depression (β = ?.318, p <.001), schizotypy (β = ?.473, p <.001), and RAADS-R (β = ?.285, p <.001) scales. Additionally, both overall pleasantness (β = ?.203, p <.01) and intensity (β =.194, p <.05) ratings were negatively correlated to the RAADS-R. Our findings indicate that retronasal stimuli present a feasible alternative to olfactory assessment of psychological states and further reinforces evidence indicating a correlation between olfactory and psychological measures. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Effectiveness of a group b outer membrane vesicle meningococcal vaccine in preventing hospitalization from gonorrhea in New Zealand: A retrospective cohort study",2019,"Gonorrhea is a major global public health problem with emergence of multiple drug-resistant strains with no effective vaccine. This retrospective cohort study aimed to estimate the effectiveness of the New Zealand meningococcal B vaccine against gonorrhea-associated hospitalization. The cohort consisted of individuals born from 1984 to 1999 residing in New Zealand. Therefore, it was eligible for meningococcal B vaccination from 2004 to 2008. Administrative datasets of demographics, customs, hospitalization, education, income tax, and immunization were linked using the national Integrated Data Infrastructure. The primary outcome was hospitalization with a primary diagnosis of gonorrhea. Cox’s proportional hazards models were applied with a Firth correction for rare outcomes to generate estimates of hazard ratios. Vaccine effectiveness estimates were calculated as 1-Hazard Ratio expressed as a percentage. There were 1,143,897 eligible cohort members with 135 missing information on gender, 16,245 missing ethnicity, and 197,502 missing deprivation. Therefore, only 935,496 cohort members were included in the analysis. After adjustment for gender, ethnicity, and deprivation, vaccine effectiveness (MeNZB?) against hospitalization caused by gonorrhea was estimated to be 24% (95% CI 1–42%). In conclusion, the data suggests vaccination with MeNZB? significantly reduced the rate of hospitalization from gonorrhea. This supports prior research indicating possible cross protection of this vaccine against gonorrhea acquisition and disease in the outpatient setting. ? 2019 by the authors.

"The performance of 'temperature stick' carbon dioxide absorbent monitors in diving rebreathers",2019,"INTRODUCTION: Diving rebreathers use canisters containing soda lime to remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from expired gas. Soda lime has a finite ability to absorb CO?. Temperature sticks monitor the exothermic reaction between CO? and soda lime to predict remaining absorptive capacity. The accuracy of these predictions was investigated in two rebreathers that utilise temperature sticks. METHODS: Inspiration and rEvo rebreathers filled with new soda lime were immersed in water at 19°C and operated on mechanical circuits whose ventilation and CO?-addition parameters simulated dives involving either moderate exercise (6 MET) throughout (mod-ex), or 90 minutes of 6 MET exercise followed by 2 MET exercise (low-ex) until breakthrough (inspired PCO? [PiCO?] = 1 kPa). Simulated dives were conducted at surface pressure (sea-level) (low-ex: Inspiration, n = 5; rEvo, n = 5; mod-ex: Inspiration, n = 7, rEvo, n = 5) and at 3-6 metres' sea water (msw) depth (mod-ex protocol only: Inspiration, n = 8; rEvo, n = 5). RESULTS: Operated at surface pressure, both rebreathers warned appropriately in four of five low-ex tests but failed to do so in the 12 mod-ex tests. At 3-6 msw depth, warnings preceded breakthrough in 11 of 13 mod-ex tests. The rEvo warned conservatively in all five tests (approximately 60 minutes prior). Inspiration warnings immediately preceded breakthrough in six of eight tests, but were marginally late in one test and 13 minutes late in another. CONCLUSION: When operated at even shallow depth, temperature sticks provided timely warning of significant CO? breakthrough in the scenarios examined. They are much less accurate during simulated exercise at surface pressure.

"Volumetric and surface characteristics of gray matter in adult dyslexia and dyscalculia",2019,"Dyslexia, dyscalculia and their comorbid manifestation are prevalent disorders associated with well-documented behavioral manifestations. However, attempts to relate these manifestations to abnormalities in brain structure have yielded mixed results, with no clear consistency across a range of measures. In this study, we used a unique design including adults with dyslexia, dyscalculia, both disorders and controls, to explore differences in gray matter characteristics across groups. Specifically, we examined whether dyslexia, dyscalculia, or their comorbid manifestation could be related to volumetric and surface characteristics of gray matter, using voxel-based and surface-based morphometry. We demonstrate with Bayesian analyses that the present data favor the null model of no differences between groups across the brain, a result that is in line with recent findings in this field of research. Importantly, we provide detailed statistical maps to enable robust assessment of our findings, and to promote cumulative evaluation of the evidence. Together, these findings suggest that gray matter differences associated with dyslexia and dyscalculia might not be as reliable as suggested by previous literature, with important implications for our understanding of these disorders. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","adult; Article; Bayesian learning; behavior assessment; brain function; brain size; clinical article; clinical assessment; comorbidity; controlled study; cortical thickness (brain); disease association; dyscalculia; dyslexia; educational status; factorial design; female; gray matter; high risk population; human; image quality; intermethod comparison; intermethod reliability; male; morphometry; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; surface based morphometry; voxel based morphometry"
"The development of tyrosyl-DNA phosphodyesterase 1 (TDP1) inhibitors based on the amines combining aromatic/heteroaromatic and monoterpenoid moieties",2019,"Background: Inhibition of the DNA repair enzyme, tyrosyl-DNA phosphodiesterase 1 (TDP1), may increase the efficacy of cancer drugs that cause damage to tumor cell DNA. Among the known TDP1 inhibitors, there are compounds containing moieties of natural substances, e.g., monoterpenoids. In this work, we synthesized several compounds containing aromatic/ heteroaromatic amines and monoterpenoid groups and assessed their TDP1 inhibition potential. Methods: Structures of all the synthesized compounds were confirmed by1H and13C NMR as well as HRMS. The TDP1 inhibitory activity of the amines was determined by real-time fluorescence oligonucleotide biosensor. Results: The synthesized secondary amines had TDP1 inhibitory activity IC50 in the range of 0.79-9.2 μM. The highest activity was found for (–)-myrtenal derivatives containing p-bromoaniline or m-(trifluoromethyl)aniline residue. Conclusion: We synthesized 22 secondary amines; of these, 17 amines are novel chemical structures. Many of the amines inhibit TDP1 activity in the low micromolar range. Therefore, these compounds are promising for further study of their antiproliferative activity in conjunction with DNA damaging drugs. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.","2,5 bis(4 amidinophenyl)furan; amidine; aromatic compound; phosphodiesterase inhibitor; aqueous solution; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; column chromatography; comparative study; controlled study; crystal structure; drug purification; drug synthesis; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; Escherichia coli; fluorescence; human; hydrogen bond; IC50; molecular model; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; regioselectivity"
"Application of supervised machine learning algorithms in the classification of sagittal gait patterns of cerebral palsy children with spastic diplegia",2019,"Gait classification has been widely used for children with cerebral palsy (CP) to assist with clinical decision making and to evaluate different treatment outcomes. The aim of this study was to evaluate supervised machine learning algorithms in the classification of sagittal gait patterns for CP children with spastic diplegia. Gait parameters were extracted from gait data obtained from two hundred children with spastic diplegia CP, and were used to represent the key kinematic features of each individual's gait. Seven supervised machine learning algorithms including an artificial neural network (ANN), discriminant analysis, naive Bayes, decision tree, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest were compared by constructing a gait classification system based on the same gait data. The performance of these algorithms was then evaluated using a standard 10-fold cross-validation procedure. The results show that the ANN has the best prediction accuracy (93.5%) with a low resubstitution error (5.8%), high specificity (>0.93) and high sensitivity (>0.92). The decision tree algorithm, SVM, and random forest approaches also have high prediction accuracy (>77.9%) with low resubstitution error (<14.3%), moderate specificity (>0.5) and moderate sensitivity (>0.2). The discriminant analysis, naive Bayes and KNN methods have relatively poor classification performance. Given these results for classification performance and prediction accuracy, the ANN is a good candidate for gait classifications for CP children with spastic diplegia. The decision tree is also attractive for clinical applications due to its transparency. Supervised machine learning algorithms can potentially be integrated into an expert gait analysis system that can interpret gait data and automatically generate high-quality analyses. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Barium compounds; Classifiers; Data mining; Decision making; Decision trees; Discriminant analysis; Diseases; Forecasting; Gait analysis; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Quality control; Supervised learning; Support vector machines; 10-fold cross-validation; Children with cerebral palsies; Classification performance; Clinical decision making; Decision-tree algorithm; Gait classification; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Supervised machine learning; Learning algorithms; algorithm; area under the curve; Article; artificial neural network; Bayesian learning; cerebral palsy; child; childhood disease; decision tree; diagnostic test accuracy study; discriminant analysis; gait; human; k nearest neighbor; machine learning; nerve cell; pattern recognition; perceptron; prediction; preschool child; priority journal; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; school child; sensitivity and specificity; supervised machine learning; support vector machine"
"Medicine Administration in People with Parkinson’s Disease in New Zealand: An Interprofessional, Stakeholder-Driven Online Survey",2019,"Medicine administration errors are twice as frequent in people with dysphagia than in those without. Medicine administration is particularly critical for people with Parkinson’s disease where late, or missed doses reduce medicine effectiveness and impact on the quality of life. The aim of this study was to explore the current medicine administration practices of people with Parkinson’s disease in New Zealand. A self-administered online survey was developed by an interprofessional group including people with Parkinson’s disease (the primary stakeholders), speech-language pathologists and pharmacists. The survey was administered using a cross-sectional study design and asked respondents about self-reported swallowing difficulties [using Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10)], medicine regimes and strategies used to swallow medicines. Seventy-one people with Parkinson’s disease responded to the survey (69% male, mean age 72?years, mean years with Parkinson’s disease 9?years). Respondents reported complex daily multi-medicine consumption (mean no. of pills 11, range 2–25). Analyses showed that 57% of respondents scored outside the normal range for EAT-10 (> 3) with 57% complaining of difficulties with pills. Many respondents admitted to missing medicines and requiring external reminders. Multiple strategies for swallowing pills were described including crushing tablets, using yoghurt or fruit juice, and swallowing strategies (such as head tilt, effortful swallow, chin down and altered pill placement in the mouth). Medicine administration is complex and challenging for people with Parkinson’s disease. The development of educational packages for people with Parkinson’s disease, their carers and health professionals is much needed. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","acetylsalicylic acid; amantadine; amitriptyline; amlodipine; apomorphine; atorvastatin; benserazide; candesartan; carbidopa; cilazapril; citalopram; clonazepam; clopidogrel; docusate sodium; domperidone; donepezil; doxazosin; entacapone; escitalopram; fludrocortisone; levodopa; metoprolol; midodrine; nortriptyline; omeprazole; pramipexole; ropinirole; selegiline; tolcapone; unindexed drug; prescription drug; adult; aged; Article; clinical practice; controlled study; cross-sectional study; decreased appetite; disease duration; drug administration; drug safety; drug use; dysphagia; Eating Assessment Tool 10; female; gastrointestinal disease; health practitioner; health survey; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; medical education; medication error; middle aged; nausea; New Zealand; Parkinson disease; pathologist; pharmacist; priority journal; scoring system; self report; swallowing; taste disorder; vomiting; xerostomia; dysphagia; medication compliance; oral drug administration; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; questionnaire; speech disorder; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Administration, Oral; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Deglutition; Deglutition Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; New Zealand; Parkinson Disease; Pharmacists; Prescription Drugs; Self Report; Speech-Language Pathology; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"The impact of green space and biodiversity on health",2019,"Urban green spaces are associated with many health outcomes, but the mechanisms underlying these links remain unclear. One explanation is that biodiverse microbiomes in green spaces affect human health by modifying immune function. Our systematic review included studies that investigated the relationship between green space and either health or biodiversity. Reported effects of green space on health were generally positive, but 22% of the papers identified either no effect or negative effects. We also found that although green space was commonly associated with biodiversity, few green-space health studies simultaneously examined biodiversity. Overreliance on cross-sectional studies, various definitions of green space, and a lack of research in tropical and developing nations limit the conclusions that can be drawn. A better understanding of the biological aspects of contact with nature is required before city planners can optimize green spaces for health gains. ?

"Outcomes of patients with heart failure after primary prevention ICD unit generator replacement",2019,"Objective Data describing outcomes after implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) unit generator replacement in patients with heart failure (HF) with primary prevention devices are limited. Method Data on patients with HF who underwent primary prevention ICD/cardiac resynchronisation therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D) implantation from 2007 until mid-2015 who subsequently received unit generator replacement were analysed. Outcomes assessed were mortality, appropriate ICD therapy and shock, and procedural complications. Results 61 of 385 patients with HF with primary prevention ICD/CRT-D undergoing unit generator replacement were identified. Follow-up period was 1.8±1.5 years after replacement. 43 (70.5%) patients had not received prior appropriate ICD therapy prior to unit replacement. The cumulative risks of appropriate ICD therapy at 1, 3 and 5 years after unit replacement in those without prior ICD therapy were 0%, 6.2% and 50% compared with 6.2%, 59.8% and 86.6%, respectively (p=0.005) in those with prior ICD therapies. No predictive factors associated with appropriate ICD therapy after replacement could be identified. 41 (32.8%) patients no longer met guideline indications at the time of unit replacement but risks of subsequent appropriate ICD interventions were not different compared with those who continued to meet primary prevention ICD indications. The 5-year mortality risk after unit replacement was 18.4% and there were high procedural complication rates (9.8%). Conclusion No predictive marker successfully stratified patients no longer needing ICD support prospectively. Finding such a marker is important in decision-making about device replacement particularly given the concerns about the complication rates. These factors should be considered at the time of ICD unit replacement. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. No commercial re-use. See rights and permissions.

"Multi-day, multi-sensor ambulatory monitoring of gastric electrical activity",2019,"Objective: Bioelectrial signals known as slow waves play a key role in coordinating gastric motility. Slow wave dysrhythmias have been associated with a number of functional motility disorders. However, there have been limited human recordings obtained in the consious state or over an extended period of time. This study aimed to evaluate a robust ambulatory recording platform. Approach: A commercially available multi-sensor recording system (Shimmer3, ShimmerSensing) was applied to acquire slow wave information from the stomach of six humans and four pigs. First, acute experiments were conducted in pigs to verify the accuracy of the recording module by comparing to a standard widely employed electrophysiological mapping system (ActiveTwo, BioSemi). Then, patients with medically refractory gastroparesis undergoing temporary gastric stimulator implantation were enrolled and gastric slow waves were recorded from mucosally-implanted electrodes for 5 d continuously. Accelerometer data was also collected to exclude data segments containing excessive patient motion artefact. Main results: Slow wave signals and activation times from the Shimmer3 module were closely comparable to a standard electrophysiological mapping system. Slow waves were able to be recorded continuously for 5 d in human subjects. Over the 5 d, slow wave frequency was 2.8 ± 0.6 cpm and amplitude was 0.2 ± 0.3 mV. Significance: A commercial multi-sensor recording module was validated for recording electrophysiological slow waves for 5 d, including in ambulatory patients. Multiple modules could be used simultaneously in the future to track the spatio-temporal propagation of slow waves. This framework can now allow for patho-electrophysiological studies to be undertaken to allow symptom correlation with dysrhythmic slow wave events. ? 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.","ambulatory monitoring; animal; devices; electrophysiology; human; physiology; pig; stomach; time factor; Animals; Electrophysiological Phenomena; Humans; Monitoring, Ambulatory; Stomach; Swine; Time Factors"
"How satiating are the ‘satiety’ peptides: A problem of pharmacology versus physiology in the development of novel foods for regulation of food intake",2019,"Developing novel foods to suppress energy intake and promote negative energy balance and weight loss has been a long-term but commonly unsuccessful challenge. Targeting regulation of appetite is of interest to public health researchers and industry in the quest to develop ‘functional’ foods, but poor understanding of the underpinning mechanisms regulating food intake has hampered progress. The gastrointestinal (GI) or ‘satiety’ peptides including cholecystokinin (CCK), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY) secreted following a meal, have long been purported as predictive biomarkers of appetite response, including food intake. Whilst peptide infusion drives a clear change in hunger/fullness and eating behaviour, inducing GI-peptide secretion through diet may not, possibly due to modest effects of single meals on peptide levels. We conducted a review of 70 dietary preload (DIET) and peptide infusion (INFUSION) studies in lean healthy adults that reported outcomes of CCK, GLP-1 and PYY. DIET studies were acute preload interventions. INFUSION studies showed that minimum increase required to suppress ad libitum energy intake for CCK, GLP-1 and PYY was 3.6-, 4.0- and 3.1-fold, respectively, achieved through DIET in only 29%, 0% and 8% of interventions. Whether circulating ‘thresholds’ of peptide concentration likely required for behavioural change can be achieved through diet is questionable. As yet, no individual or group of peptides can be measured in blood to reliably predict feelings of hunger and food intake. Developing foods that successfully target enhanced secretion of GI-origin ‘satiety’ peptides for weight loss remains a significant challenge. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Use of a Purpose-Built Impression Cytology Device for Gene Expression Quantification at the Ocular Surface Using Quantitative PCR and Droplet Digital PCR",2019,"To describe an impression cytology (IC) technique using a purpose-built, sterile, EYEPRIM IC device that can be coupled with a TRIzol reagent-based RNA extraction protocol to yield sufficient RNA for gene expression analysis.Methods:IC samples using the EYEPRIM device were collected from the bulbar conjunctiva, with and without topical anesthesia, and evaluated for RNA yield, the absence of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) inhibitors, and the ability to detect biomarkers by quantitative real-time PCR and droplet digital PCR. A technique for collecting IC samples in the clinic, while preserving RNA, and a protocol for subsequent laboratory analysis of RNA were developed.Results:The extracted RNA was free of PCR inhibitors and could be synthesized into complementary DNA and used for successful relative quantification of ocular surface biomarkers by quantitative real-time PCR. For gene targets present in low abundance, complementary DNA could also be used for quantification by the relatively new and emerging method of droplet digital PCR. The described method was successfully used to evaluate 3 biomarkers in a clinical trial assessing the tolerability of a proprietary eyelid therapy in 92 IC samples from a study population of 46 participants.Conclusions:IC is a recognized technique for ocular surface cell evaluation and protein biomarker quantification but is infrequently used for quantifying gene expression. The EYEPRIM device allows ease of use and impression-to-impression consistency while accurate gene expression data offers a highly specific and sensitive method of disease characterization for clinician scientists to use in diagnosis. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.","complementary DNA; gelatinase B; interleukin 6; mucin 5AC; biological marker; eye protein; RNA; Article; clinical article; controlled study; droplet digital polymerase chain reaction; gene expression; human; impression cytology; intermethod comparison; ocular surface disease; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; biosynthesis; conjunctiva; cytology; genetics; metabolism; procedures; randomized controlled trial; reproducibility; single blind procedure; Biomarkers; Conjunctiva; Eye Proteins; Gene Expression; Humans; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reproducibility of Results; RNA; Single-Blind Method"
"Tertiary hospital retrospective observational audit of tonsillectomy",2019,"Objectives: Tertiary hospitals see a wide array of complex paediatric patients requiring the procedure of tonsillectomy to alleviate airway symptoms. To investigate the implications of patient-specific factors on postoperative morbidities and hospital stay length, including the role of BMI and AH as predictors for airway complications following surgery. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed for all patients presenting at The Children's Hospital at Westmead for routine tonsillectomy between July 2010 and July 2014. Results: Of 500 charts, 420 patients met inclusion criteria. 155 (37%) patients had a pre-existing comorbidity. Polysomnogram (PSG) was conducted prior to surgery (n = 129). BMI results showed a mean BMI of 20.0, n = 25 were overweight, n = 70 were obese and n = 11 underweight. 84 patients (20%) experienced a postoperative complication/unexpected morbidity. There were no returns to theatre and no mortality. 24 patients had more than one complication. Complication rate was highest in the patients <2 years of age. There was a statistically significant difference in the number of desaturation related complications between obese and non-obese groups p = 0.00480. There was statistically significant difference in length of hospital stay between the two groups. 16% of children with co-morbidities stayed for >2 nights in hospital (25/155) compared to 7.5% of children without co-morbidities p = 0.00607. 9% of children with co-morbidities stayed for 3 nights in hospital (14/155) compared to patients without co-morbidities (6/256), p = 0.00167. Conclusions: This audit confirms the impact of age, obesity and certain co-morbidities on the potential costs to the hospital in managing complications and length of stay after surgery. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","adolescent; Article; body mass; child; clinical audit; comorbidity; female; hospitalization; human; infant; length of stay; major clinical study; male; medical record review; morbidity; obesity; personal experience; polysomnography; postoperative period; priority journal; retrospective study; tertiary care center; tonsillectomy; underweight; Australia; body mass; clinical audit; complication; postoperative complication; preschool child; statistics and numerical data; tertiary care center; Adolescent; Australia; Body Mass Index; Child; Child, Preschool; Clinical Audit; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Infant; Length of Stay; Male; Obesity; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Tertiary Care Centers; Tonsillectomy"
"Gestational diabetes and the risk of late stillbirth: a case–control study from England, UK",2019,"Objective: To explore the separate effects of being ‘at risk’ of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and screening for GDM, and of raised fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and clinical diagnosis of GDM, on the risk of late stillbirth. Design: Prospective case–control study. Setting: Forty-one maternity units in the UK. Population: Women who had a stillbirth ?28 weeks of gestation (n = 291) and women with an ongoing pregnancy at the time of interview (n = 733). Methods: Causal mediation analysis explored the joint effects of (i) ‘at risk’ of GDM and screening for GDM and (ii) raised FPG (?5.6 mmol/l) and clinical diagnosis of GDM on the risks of late stillbirth. Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) were estimated by logistic regression adjusted for confounders identified by directed acyclic graphs. Main outcome measures: Screening for GDM and FPG levels. Results: Women ‘at risk’ of GDM, but not screened, experienced 44% greater risk of late stillbirth than those not ‘at risk’ (aOR 1.44, 95% CI 1.01–2.06). Women ‘at risk’ of GDM who were screened experienced no such increase (aOR 0.98, 95% CI 0.70–1.36). Women with raised FPG not diagnosed with GDM experienced four-fold greater risk of late stillbirth than women with normal FPG (aOR 4.22, 95% CI 1.04–17.02). Women with raised FPG who were diagnosed with GDM experienced no such increase (aOR 1.10, 95% CI 0.31–3.91). Conclusions: Optimal screening and diagnosis of GDM mitigate the higher risks of late stillbirth in women ‘at risk’ of GDM and/or with raised FPG. Failure to diagnose GDM leaves women with raised FPG exposed to avoidable risk of late stillbirth.

"Canine and human sinoatrial node: differences and similarities in the structure, function, molecular profiles, and arrhythmia",2019,"The sinoatrial node (SAN) is the primary pacemaker in canine and human hearts. The SAN in both species has a unique three-dimensional heterogeneous structure characterized by small pacemaker myocytes enmeshed within fibrotic strands, which partially insulate the cells from aberrant atrial activation. The SAN pacemaker tissue expresses a unique signature of proteins and receptors that mediate SAN automaticity, ion channel currents, and cell-to-cell communication, which are predominantly similar in both species. Recent intramural optical mapping, integrated with structural and molecular studies, has revealed the existence of up to five specialized SAN conduction pathways that preferentially conduct electrical activation to atrial tissues. The intrinsic heart rate, intranodal leading pacemaker shifts, and changes in conduction in response to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli are similar. Structural and/or functional impairments due to cardiac diseases including heart failure cause SAN dysfunctions (SNDs) in both species. These dysfunctions are usually manifested as severe bradycardia, tachy-brady arrhythmias, and conduction abnormalities including exit block and SAN reentry, which could lead to atrial tachycardia and fibrillation, cardiac arrest, and heart failure. Pharmaceutical drugs and implantable pacemakers are only partially successful in managing SNDs, emphasizing a critical need to develop targeted mechanism-based therapies to treat SNDs. Because several structural and functional characteristics are similar between the canine and human SAN, research in these species may be mutually beneficial for developing novel treatment approaches. This review describes structural, functional, and molecular similarities and differences between the canine and human SAN, with special emphasis on arrhythmias and unique causal mechanisms of SND in diseased hearts. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","adenosine receptor; calcium ion; cyclic nucleotide; G protein coupled inwardly rectifying potassium channel; gap junction protein; ion channel; sodium channel; adrenergic stimulation; Article; bradycardia; cell communication; electric conductivity; functional disease; heart arrest; heart arrhythmia; heart automaticity; heart failure; heart fibrillation; heart rhythm; human; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; sinoatrial conduction; sinus node; supraventricular tachycardia; anatomy and histology; animal; dog; dog disease; heart arrhythmia; heart muscle conduction system; pathophysiology; physiology; sinus node; veterinary medicine; Animals; Arrhythmias, Cardiac; Dog Diseases; Dogs; Heart Conduction System; Humans; Sinoatrial Node"
"Predictors of Reading Skills in Children With Listening Concerns",2019,"Objectives: Previous research shows that children with reading disorders perform poorly on auditory processing (AP) tasks. Correlational studies have also shown significant associations between some AP tasks and word and nonword reading. There is less clear evidence for AP contributions to spelling and passage reading. The aim of this research was to extend current knowledge by investigating the association between a range of AP measures used clinically and children's reading of words, nonwords, and passages, as well as word spelling. Design: Regression analyses were conducted on data from 90 children 7 to 13 years of age (58 males) with reported listening and/or reading concerns. All children had normal hearing sensitivity and were tested on AP tasks including the frequency pattern test (FPT), dichotic digits test, random gap detection test, and the masking level difference. Reading tasks included word, nonword, and passage reading. Phonologic processing, core language skills, nonverbal intelligence, memory, and attention were also measured. Results: All multiregression analyses were fixed order with age and gender, nonverbal intelligence, core language, phoneme manipulation, and digits backward scores included in the model before AP measures. FPT was the only AP task that accounted for significant unique variance in word/nonword reading and nonword spelling, but not passage reading. Conclusions: The findings from this study failed to show an association between many clinically used AP measures and children's reading and spelling outcomes. Nevertheless, they reiterate the importance of evaluating FPT in children with word reading disorders. The findings justify further investigation into the role of this test when diagnosing children with reading or spelling disorders. ? Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

"Hypoxia-activated prodrugs and (lack of) clinical progress: The need for hypoxia-based biomarker patient selection in phase III clinical trials",2019,"Hypoxia-activated prodrugs (HAPs) are designed to specifically target the hypoxic cells of tumors, which are an important cause of treatment resistance to conventional therapies. Despite promising preclinical and clinical phase I and II results, the most important of which are described in this review, the implementation of hypoxia-activated prodrugs in the clinic has, so far, not been successful. The lack of stratification of patients based on tumor hypoxia status, which can vary widely, is sufficient to account for the failure of phase III trials. To fully exploit the potential of hypoxia-activated prodrugs, hypoxia stratification of patients is needed. Here, we propose a biomarker-stratified enriched Phase III study design in which only biomarker-positive (i.e. hypoxia-positive) patients are randomized between standard treatment and the combination of standard treatment with a hypoxia-activated prodrug. This implies the necessity of a Phase II study in which the biomarker or a combination of biomarkers will be evaluated. The total number of patients needed for both clinical studies will be far lower than in currently used randomize-all designs. In addition, we elaborate on the improvements in HAP design that are feasible to increase the treatment success rates. ? 2019 The Authors","2 (2 nitro 1h imidazol 1 yl) n (2,2,3,3,3 pentafluoropropyl)acetamide; aldo keto reductase family 1 member C3; biological marker; carbonate dehydratase IX; carboplatin; docetaxel; evofosfamide; gemcitabine; glucose transporter 1; hypoxia activated prodrug; hypoxia inducible factor 1; nimorazole; osteopontin; paclitaxel; pimonidazole; pr 104; prodrug; sorafenib; tirapazamine; unclassified drug; apoptosis; Article; cancer therapy; cell proliferation; cytotoxicity; DNA damage; fatigue; fluorine magnetic resonance imaging; gene expression; human; hypoxia; immunohistochemistry; muscle cramp; neutropenia; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; oxygen concentration; patient selection; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); phase 3 clinical trial (topic); positron emission tomography; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); thrombocytopenia; treatment outcome; tumor growth; tumor hypoxia"
"Comparison of subtyping approaches and the underlying drivers of microbial signatures for chronic rhinosinusitis",2019,"Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous condition characterized by persistent sinus inflammation and microbial dysbiosis. This study aimed to identify clinically relevant subgroups of CRS patients based on distinct microbial signatures, with a comparison to the commonly used phenotypic subgrouping approach. The underlying drivers of these distinct microbial clusters were also investigated, together with associations with epithelial barrier integrity. Sinus biopsy specimens were collected from CRS patients (n=23) and disease controls (n=8). The expression of 42 tight junction genes was evaluated using quantitative PCR together with microbiota analysis and immunohistochemistry for measuring mucosal integrity and inflammation. CRS patients clustered into two distinct microbial subgroups using probabilistic modelling Dirichlet (DC) multinomial mixtures. DC1 exhibited significantly reduced bacterial diversity and increased dispersion and was dominated by Pseudomonas, Haemophilus, and Achromobacter. DC2 had significantly elevated B cells and incidences of nasal polyps and higher numbers of Anaerococcus, Megasphaera, Prevotella, Atopobium, and Propionibacterium. In addition, each DC exhibited distinct tight junction gene and protein expression profiles compared with those of controls. Stratifying CRS patients based on clinical phenotypic subtypes (absence or presence of nasal polyps [CRSsNP or CRSwNP, respectively] or with cystic fibrosis [CRSwCF]) accounted for a larger proportion of the variation in the microbial data set than with DC groupings. However, no significant differences between CRSsNP and CRSwNP cohorts were observed for inflammatory markers, beta-dispersion, and alpha-diversity measures. In conclusion, both approaches used for stratifying CRS patients had benefits and pitfalls, but DC clustering provided greater resolution when studying tight junction impairment. Future studies in CRS should give careful consideration to the patient subtyping approach used. ? 2019 Biswas et al.","adult; bacterium; biopsy; chronic disease; classification; genetics; human; immunology; inflammation; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; mucosa; nose polyp; paranasal sinus; pathology; sinusitis; tight junction; Adult; Bacteria; Biopsy; Chronic Disease; Humans; Inflammation; Microbiota; Mucous Membrane; Nasal Polyps; Paranasal Sinuses; Sinusitis; Tight Junctions"
"Patterns of Exposure to Cumulative Risk Through Age 2 and Associations with Problem Behaviors at Age 4.5: Evidence from Growing Up in New Zealand",2019,"Exposure to cumulative risk (CR) has important implications for child development, yet little is known about how frequency, persistence, and timing of CR exposure during early childhood predict behavioral problems already before school start. We examine prospective longitudinal associations between patterns of CR exposure from third trimester through 2?years and subsequent behavior problems at 4.5?years. In 6156 diverse children in the Growing Up in New Zealand longitudinal study, the presence of 12 risk factors, spanning maternal health, social status, and home and neighborhood environment, defined CR and were assessed at last trimester and 9?months and 2?years of age. At child age 4.5?years, mothers completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, where a score ? 16 indicated an abnormal level of problem behaviors (ALPB). Children exposed to a CR ? 1 at least once in early development, compared to those with consistent CR = 0, showed a significantly higher likelihood of ALPB at 4.5?years. Consistent high exposure to CR ? 4 across all three assessments had the highest prevalence (44%) of ALPB at age 4.5. Children with high CR exposure on two of three, compared to on all three, time points in early development did not evidence a significantly reduced prevalence (32%–41%) of ALPB. The common co-occurrence of risk factors and their significant developmental impact when accumulated early in life underscore the need for systematic multisector intervention and policy implementation during pregnancy and shortly after birth to improve outcomes for vulnerable children. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Protein-coding variants implicate novel genes related to lipid homeostasis contributing to body-fat distribution",2019,"Body-fat distribution is a risk factor for adverse cardiovascular health consequences. We analyzed the association of body-fat distribution, assessed by waist-to-hip ratio adjusted for body mass index, with 228,985 predicted coding and splice site variants available on exome arrays in up to 344,369 individuals from five major ancestries (discovery) and 132,177 European-ancestry individuals (validation). We identified 15 common (minor allele frequency, MAF ?5%) and nine low-frequency or rare (MAF <5%) coding novel variants. Pathway/gene set enrichment analyses identified lipid particle, adiponectin, abnormal white adipose tissue physiology and bone development and morphology as important contributors to fat distribution, while cross-trait associations highlight cardiometabolic traits. In functional follow-up analyses, specifically in Drosophila RNAi-knockdowns, we observed a significant increase in the total body triglyceride levels for two genes (DNAH10 and PLXND1). We implicate novel genes in fat distribution, stressing the importance of interrogating low-frequency and protein-coding variants. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","adiponectin; protein; lipid; protein; ACVR1C gene; adipogenesis; African; angiogenesis; ANGPTL4 gene; Article; bioinformatics; body fat distribution; body mass; bone development; coding; DAGLB gene; DNAH10 gene; Drosophila; East Asian; European; exome; expression quantitative trait locus; FGFR2 gene; gene; gene frequency; gene knockdown; genetic trait; genetic variability; genotype; glucose homeostasis; Hispanic; human; insulin blood level; lipid homeostasis; meta analysis; MLXIPL gene; nonhuman; phenotype; PLXND1 gene; priority journal; RAPGEF3 gene; recessive inheritance; RNA splicing; RREB1 gene; sex difference; South Asian; TBX15 gene; triacylglycerol level; waist hip ratio; white adipose tissue; animal; body fat distribution; case control study; female; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; genome-wide association study; homeostasis; male; procedures; risk factor; Animals; Body Fat Distribution; Body Mass Index; Case-Control Studies; Drosophila; Exome; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Homeostasis; Humans; Lipids; Male; Proteins; Risk Factors; Waist-Hip Ratio"
"Microtiter screening reveals oxygen-dependent antimicrobial activity of natural products against mastitis-causing bacteria",2019,"In this study we investigated the influence of oxygen availability on a phenotypic microtiter screen to identify new, natural product inhibitors of growth for the bovine mastitis-causing microorganisms; Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli. Mastitis is a common disease in dairy cattle worldwide and is a major cause of reduced milk yield and antibiotic usage in dairy herds. Prevention of bovine mastitis commonly relies on the application of teat disinfectants that contain either iodine or chlorhexidine. These compounds are used extensively in human clinical settings and increased tolerance to chlorhexidine has been reported in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative microorganisms. As such new, non-human use alternatives are required for the agricultural industry. Our screening was conducted under normoxic (20% oxygen) and hypoxic (<1% oxygen) conditions to mimic the conditions on teat skin and within the mammary gland respectively, against two natural compound libraries. No compounds inhibited E. coli under either oxygen condition. Against the Gram-positive microorganisms, 12 inhibitory compounds were identified under normoxic conditions, and 10 under hypoxic conditions. Data revealed a clear oxygen-dependency amongst compounds inhibiting growth, with only partial overlap between oxygen conditions. The oxygen-dependent inhibitory activity of a naturally occurring quinone, β-lapachone, against S. uberis was subsequently investigated and we demonstrated that this compound is only active under normoxic conditions with a minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration of 32 ?M and kills via a reactive oxygen species-dependent mechanism as has been demonstrated in other microorganisms. These results demonstrate the importance of considering oxygen-availability in high-throughput inhibitor discovery. ? 2019 Ferguson, Menorca, Van Zuylen, Cheung, McConnell, Rennison, Brimble, Bodle, McDougall, Cook and Heikal.",""
"Community-driven roadmap for integrated disease maps",2019,"The Disease Maps Project builds on a network of scientific and clinical groups that exchange best practices, share information and develop systems biomedicine tools. The project aims for an integrated, highly curated and user-friendly platform for disease-related knowledge. The primary focus of disease maps is on interconnected signaling, metabolic and gene regulatory network pathways represented in standard formats. The involvement of domain experts ensures that the key disease hallmarks are covered and relevant, up-to-date knowledge is adequately represented. Expert-curated and computer readable, disease maps may serve as a compendium of knowledge, allow for data-supported hypothesis generation or serve as a scaffold for the generation of predictive mathematical models. This article summarizes the 2nd Disease Maps Community meeting, highlighting its important topics and outcomes. We outline milestones on the roadmap for the future development of disease maps, including creating and maintaining standardized disease maps; sharing parts of maps that encode common human disease mechanisms; providing technical solutions for complexity management of maps; and Web tools for in-depth exploration of such maps. A dedicated discussion was focused on mathematical modeling approaches, as one of the main goals of disease map development is the generation of mathematically interpretable representations to predict disease comorbidity or drug response and to suggest drug repositioning, altogether supporting clinical decisions. ? 2018 The Author(s) 2018.

"Accumulation of Dietary S-Methyl Cysteine Sulfoxide in Human Prostate Tissue",2019,"Scope: Observational studies have associated consumption of cruciferous vegetables with reduced risk of prostate cancer. This effect has been associated with the degradation products of glucosinolates—thioglycosides that accumulate within crucifers. The possible role of S-methyl cysteine sulfoxide, a metabolite that also accumulates in cruciferous vegetables, and its derivatives, in cancer prevention is relatively unexplored compared to glucosinolate derivatives. The hypothesis that consuming a broccoli soup results in the accumulation of sulfate (a SMCSO derivative) and other broccoli-derived metabolites in prostate tissue is tested. Methods and results: Eighteen men scheduled for transperineal prostate biopsy were recruited into a 4-week parallel single blinded diet supplementation study (NCT02821728). Nine men supplemented their diet with three 300 mL portions of a broccoli soup each week for four weeks prior to surgery. Analyses of prostate biopsy tissues reveal no detectable levels of glucosinolates and derivatives. In contrast, SMCSO is detected in prostate tissues of the participants, with significantly higher levels in tissue of men in the supplementation arm. SMCSO was also found in blood and urine samples from a previous intervention study with the identical broccoli soup. Conclusion: The consequences of SMCSO accumulation in prostate tissues and its potential role in prevention of prostate cancer remains to be investigated. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Establishment and 12-month progress of the New Zealand Motor Neurone Disease Registry",2019,"There are only limited treatments currently available for Motor Neurone Disease, each with modest benefits. However, there is a large amount of research and drug discovery currently underway worldwide. The New Zealand Motor Neurone Disease Registry was established in 2017 to facilitate participation in research and clinical trials, and to aid researchers in planning and recruitment. The NZ MND Registry is an opt in patient registry which collects demographic, contact and clinical data for those who choose to enrol. We report anonymised aggregated data from the first year's enrolment. 12th July 2018, there were 142 participants enrolled in the NZ MND Registry. Participant sex distribution reflects the demographics reported worldwide, but ethnicity is divergent from what is seen in New Zealand overall, with an over-representation of people who identify as New Zealand European. 85.5% of participants are diagnosed with sporadic MND and 6.1% with familial MND. The remainder were participants who have not been diagnosed but have a family history, or positive genetic test for a MND-causing mutation. Levels of disability are reported using ALSFRS-R scores, and show that the majority of participants are within the higher range of the scale. The registry has facilitated entry of patients into three studies to date. The establishment of the NZ MND Registry illustrates a swift launch of a rare disease patient registry. The role of patient registries is an ever changing one, but with clear utility at every point of along the pathway to drug discovery. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale Revised; demography; disability; disease registry; ethnicity; European; familial disease; family history; female; gene mutation; genetic screening; human; major clinical study; male; motor neuron disease; New Zealand; priority journal; rare disease; rating scale; Review; scoring system; sex ratio; middle aged; motor neuron disease; New Zealand; register; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motor Neuron Disease; New Zealand; Registries"
"Effect of 16-weeks vitamin D replacement on calcium-phosphate homeostasis in overweight and obese adults",2019,"This randomised placebo-controlled trial aimed to determine the effect of 16-weeks cholecalciferol supplementation on calcium-phosphate homeostasis and bone mineral density (BMD) in overweight and obese adults. Fifty-four vitamin D-deficient (25OHD&lt;50 nmol/L), overweight and obese adults (mean age 32 ± 8.5 years) were included in the trial. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a bolus oral dose of 100,000 IU cholecalciferol followed by 4000 IU cholecalciferol/d or a matching placebo for 16 weeks. Before and after the intervention, serum calcium, phosphate, 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and C-terminal plasma fibroblast growth factor-23 (cFGF-23) concentrations were measured. Whole-body BMD was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and diet and sun exposure were assessed using self-administered questionnaires. There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics between the vitamin D and placebo group. After 16-weeks of vitamin D supplementation, mean changes in 25(OH)D concentration were higher in the vitamin D group (57 nmol/L 95% CI 49, 65) compared with placebo (2 nmol/L 95% CI -4, 8), P &lt; 0.001. Additionally, iPTH concentrations declined in the vitamin D group (?1.19 pmol/L 95% CI ?1.9, ?0.47) compared with placebo (0.14 pmol/L 95% CI ?0.49, 0.77), P = 0.006. There were no significant differences in calcium, phosphate, iPTH and cFGF-23 concentrations and whole-body BMD between vitamin D and placebo at follow-up. Inverse correlations were observed between mean change in serum iPTH and cFGF-23 in the vitamin D group only (r=-0.41, P = 0.029). In individuals with greater vitamin D deficiency at baseline (25(OH)D &lt; 30 nmol/L), there was a significant increase in mean whole-body BMD (0.01 g/cm 2 , 95% CI 0.001, 0.025) however, the mean change in BMD was not different between vitamin D and placebo groups in this sub-group analysis. We conclude that cholecalciferol supplementation for 16 weeks increases serum 25(OH)D concentrations and reduces iPTH concentrations in overweight and obese, but otherwise healthy adults with vitamin D deficiency, and has no effect on calcium, phosphate and iFGF-23 concentrations and whole-body BMD. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd","25 hydroxyvitamin D; calcium; calcium phosphate; colecalciferol; fibroblast growth factor 23; parathyroid hormone; phosphate; placebo; 25-hydroxyvitamin D; calcium; colecalciferol; fibroblast growth factor; fibroblast growth factor 23; parathyroid hormone; phosphate; vitamin; vitamin D; adult; Article; bone density; calcium blood level; calcium homeostasis; calcium intake; controlled study; double blind procedure; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; obese patient; obesity; parathyroid hormone blood level; phosphate blood level; phosphate intake; randomized controlled trial; sun exposure; vitamin intake; vitamin supplementation; analogs and derivatives; blood; bone density; complication; drug effect; obesity; placebo effect; vitamin D deficiency; Adult; Bone Density; Calcium; Cholecalciferol; Fibroblast Growth Factors; Humans; Obesity; Overweight; Parathyroid Hormone; Phosphates; Placebo Effect; Vitamin D; Vitamin D Deficiency; Vitamins"
"Assessing the Feasibility of Providing a Real-Time Response to Seizures Detected With Continuous Long-Term Neonatal Electroencephalography Monitoring",2019,"PURPOSE: Continuous video electroencephalography (cEEG) monitoring is the recommended gold standard of care for at-risk neonates but is not available in many Neonatal Intensive Care Units (NICUs). To conduct a randomized treatment trial of levetiracetam for the first-line treatment of neonatal seizures (the NEOLEV2 trial), we developed a monitoring infrastructure at five NICUs, implementing recent technological advancements to provide continuous video EEG monitoring and real-time response to seizure detection. Here, we report on the feasibility of providing this level of care. METHODS: Twenty-five key informant interviews were conducted with study neurologists, neonatologists, coordinators, and EEG technicians from the commercial EEG monitoring company Corticare. A general inductive approach was used to analyze these qualitative data. RESULTS: A robust infrastructure for continuous video EEG monitoring, remote review, and real-time seizure detection was established at all sites. At the time of this survey, 260 babies had been recruited and monitored for 2 to 6 days. The EEG technician review by the commercial EEG monitoring company was reassuring to families and neonatologists and led to earlier detection of seizures but did not reduce work load for neurologists. Neurologists found the automated neonatal seizure detector algorithm provided by the EEG software company Persyst useful, but the accuracy of the algorithm was not such that it could be used without review by human expert. Placement of EEG electrodes to initiate monitoring, especially after hours, remains problematic. CONCLUSIONS: Technological advancements have made it possible to provide at-risk neonates with continuous video EEG monitoring, real-time detection of and response to seizures. However, this standard of care remains unfeasible in usual clinical practice. Chief obstacles remain starting a recording and resourcing the real-time specialist review of suspect seizures.","algorithm; automated pattern recognition; brain; electroencephalography; family; feasibility study; health care personnel; human; interview; neonatal intensive care unit; neurophysiological monitoring; newborn; newborn intensive care; pathophysiology; procedures; psychology; qualitative research; seizure; software; time factor; Algorithms; Brain; Electroencephalography; Family; Feasibility Studies; Health Personnel; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Intensive Care, Neonatal; Interviews as Topic; Neurophysiological Monitoring; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Qualitative Research; Seizures; Software; Time Factors"
"The association of dietary animal and plant protein with putative risk markers of colorectal cancer in overweight pre-diabetic individuals during a weight-reducing programme: a PREVIEW sub-study",2019,"Purpose: Diets with increased protein content are popular strategies for body weight regulation, but the effect of such diets for the colonic luminal environment is unclear. We aimed to investigate the associations between putative colorectal cancer-related markers and total protein intake, plant and animal proteins, and protein from red and processed meat in pre-diabetic adults (> 25?years). Methods: Analyses were based on clinical and dietary assessments at baseline and after 1?year of intervention. Protein intake was assessed from 4-day dietary records. Putative colorectal cancer-related markers identified from 24-h faecal samples collected over three consecutive days were: concentration of short-chain fatty acids, phenols, ammonia, and pH. Results: In total, 79 participants were included in the analyses. We found a positive association between change in total protein intake (slope: 74.72 ± 28.84??mol per g faeces/E%, p = 0.01), including animal protein intake (slope: 87.63 ± 32.04??mol per g faeces/E%, p = 0.009), and change in faecal ammonia concentration. For change in ammonia, there was a dose–response trend from the most negative (lowest tertile) to the most positive (highest tertile) association (p = 0.01): in the high tertile, a change in intake of red meat was positively associated with an increase in ammonia excretion (slope: 2.0 ± 0.5??mol per g faeces/g/day, p < 0.001), whereas no such association was found in the low and medium tertile groups. Conclusion: Increases in total and animal protein intakes were associated with higher excretion of ammonia in faeces after 1?year in overweight pre-diabetic adults undertaking a weight-loss intervention. An increase in total or relative protein intake, or in the ratio of animal to plant protein, was not associated with an increase in faeces of any of the other putative colorectal cancer risk markers.

"Targeting DNA Methylation and EZH2 Activity to Overcome Melanoma Resistance to Immunotherapy",2019,"Methylation of DNA at CpG sites is the most common and stable of epigenetic changes in cancer. Hypermethylation acts to limit immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy by inhibiting endogenous interferon responses needed for recognition of cancer cells. By contrast, global hypomethylation results in the expression of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and inhibitory cytokines, accompanied by epithelial-mesenchymal changes that can contribute to immunosuppression. The drivers of these contrasting methylation states are not well understood. DNA methylation also plays a key role in cytotoxic T cell ‘exhaustion’ associated with tumor progression. We present an updated exploratory analysis of how DNA methylation may define patient subgroups and can be targeted to develop tailored treatment combinations to help improve patient outcomes. ? 2019 The Authors","DNA; polycomb repressive complex 2; programmed death 1 ligand 1; transcription factor EZH2; cancer resistance; DNA methylation; human; immune response; immunoregulation; immunotherapy; malignant neoplasm; melanoma; melanoma cell; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; Review; T lymphocyte"
"ProBNP that is not glycosylated at threonine 71 is decreased with obesity in patients with heart failure",2019,"BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Plasma concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or its amino terminal congener (NT-proBNP) are used for HF diagnosis and risk stratification. Because BNP concentrations are inexplicably lowered in obese patients, we investigated the relationship between proBNP glycosylation, plasma NT-proBNP, and body mass index (BMI) in HF patients. METHODS: Three assays were developed to distinguish between total proBNP (glycosylated plus nonglycosylated proBNP), proBNP not glycosylated at threonine 71 (NG-T71), and proBNP not glycosylated in the central region (NG-C). Intraassay and interassay CVs were &lt;15%; limits of detection were &lt;21 ng/L; and samples diluted in parallel. RESULT: Applying these assays and an NT-proBNP assay to plasma samples from 106 healthy volunteers and 238 HF patients determined that concentrations [median (interquartile range)] of proBNP, NG-T71, and NTproBNP were greater in HF patients compared with controls [300 (44 – 664), 114 (18 –254), and 179 (880 – 3459) ng/L vs 36 (18 –229), 36 (18 –175), and 40 (17–68) ng/L, respectively; all P &lt;0.012]. NG-C was undetectable in most samples. ProBNP concentrations in HF patients with BMI more or less than 30 kg/m2 were not different (P = 0.85), whereas HF patients with BMI &gt;30 kg/m2 had lower NT-proBNP and NG-T71 concentrations (P &lt; 0.003) and higher proBNP/NTproBNP and proBNP/NG-T71 ratios (P= 0.001 and P = 0.02, respectively) than those with BMI &lt;30 kg/m2. CONCLUSIONS: Increased BMI is associated with decreased concentrations of proBNP not glycosylated at T71. Decreased proBNP substrate amenable to processing could partially explain the lower NT-proBNP and BNP concentrations observed in obese individuals, including those presenting with HF. ? 2019 American Association for Clinical Chemistry.","amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; threonine; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; association; atrial fibrillation; body fat; body mass; controlled study; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; glycosylation; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; major clinical study; male; obese patient; obesity; protein blood level; receiver operating characteristic; systolic blood pressure"
"Temporal dynamics of the pharmacological MRI response to subanaesthetic ketamine in healthy volunteers: A simultaneous EEG/fMRI study",2019,"Background: Pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging has been used to investigate the neural effects of subanaesthetic ketamine in healthy volunteers. However, the effect of ketamine has been modelled with a single time course and without consideration of physiological noise. Aims: This study aimed to investigate ketamine-induced alterations in resting neural activity using conventional pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging analysis techniques with physiological noise correction, and a novel analysis utilising simultaneously recorded electroencephalography data. Methods: Simultaneous electroencephalography/functional magnetic resonance imaging and physiological data were collected from 30 healthy male participants before and during a subanaesthetic intravenous ketamine infusion. Results: Consistent with previous literature, we show widespread cortical blood-oxygen-level dependent signal increases and decreased blood-oxygen-level dependent signals in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex following ketamine. However, the latter effect was attenuated by the inclusion of motion regressors and physiological correction in the model. In a novel analysis, we modelled the pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging response with the power time series of seven electroencephalography frequency bands. This showed evidence for distinct temporal time courses of neural responses to ketamine. No electroencephalography power time series correlated with decreased blood-oxygen-level dependent signal in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex. Conclusions: We suggest the decrease in blood-oxygen-level dependent signals in the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex typically seen in the literature is the result of physiological noise, in particular cardiac pulsatility. Furthermore, modelling the pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging response with a single temporal model does not completely capture the full spectrum of neuronal dynamics. The use of electroencephalography regressors to model the response can increase confidence that the pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging is directly related to underlying neural activity. ?

"Gestational diabetes mellitus changes the metabolomes of human colostrum, transition milk and mature milk",2019,"Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a pregnancy complication that is diagnosed by the novel onset of abnormal glucose intolerance. Our study aimed to investigate the changes in human breast milk metabolome over the first month of lactation and how GDM affects milk metabolome. Material/Methods: Colostrum, transition milk, and mature milk samples from women with normal uncomplicated pregnancies (n=94) and women with GDM-complicated pregnancies (n=90) were subjected to metabolomic profiling by the use of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Results: For the uncomplicated pregnancies, there were 59 metabolites that significantly differed among colostrum, transition milk, and mature milk samples, while 58 metabolites differed in colostrum, transition milk, and mature milk samples from the GDM pregnancies. There were 28 metabolites that were found to be significantly different between women with normal pregnancies and women with GDM pregnancies among colostrum, transition milk, and mature milk samples. Conclusions: The metabolic profile of human milk is dynamic throughout the first months of lactation. High levels of amino acids in colostrum and high levels of saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids in mature milk, which may be critical for neonatal development in the first month of life, were features of both normal and GDM pregnancies. ?

"Vacancy-enhanced generation of singlet oxygen for photodynamic therapy",2019,"Oxygen vacancy (OV) engineering in semiconductors can greatly enhance the separation of photo-induced electron-hole pairs, thereby enhancing the photocatalytic activity. Taking inspiration from this, we prepared a novel BiOBr-H/Rub 2 d composite by functionalizing OV-rich BiOBr (named BiOBr-H) with a carboxyl functionalized ruthenium photosensitizer (Ru(bpy) 2 C-pyCl 2 , abbreviated as Rub 2 d), which was then successfully applied for photodynamic therapy (PDT). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirmed efficient electron transfer from the Rub 2 d complex to the intermediate energy level of BiOBr-H under visible light irradiation. In vitro and in vivo studies demonstrated that BiOBr-H/Rub 2 d was a superior agent for photodynamic therapy compared with the free ruthenium complex. The theoretical and experimental data presented thus reveal for the first time that abundant OVs in BiOBr-H can significantly improve the photocatalytic activity of a photosensitizer, resulting in the generation of more reactive oxygen species to enhance PDT. The findings of this study thus offer a new strategy for the development of highly efficient cancer therapies. ?

Design Cross-sectional Child Health CheckPoint study, between waves 6 and 7 of the national population-based Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC). Setting Assessment centres in seven Australian cities, February 2015-March 2016. Participants Of the 1874 participating families, 1288 children (51% girls) and 1264 parents (87% mothers, mean age 43.7) were analysed. Diabetic participants and non-biological pairs were excluded from concordance analyses. Outcome measures Retinal photographs were taken by non-mydriatic fundus camera. Trained graders scored vascular calibre using semi-automated software, yielding estimates of central retinal arteriolar equivalent (CRAE) and central retinal venular equivalent (CRVE) and arteriolar-venular ratio (AVR). Pearson's correlation coefficients and multivariable linear regression models assessed parent-child concordance. Survey weights and methods accounted for LSAC's complex sampling, stratification and clustering within postcodes. Results Mean (SD) of CRAE and CRVE were larger in children (159.5 (11.8) and 231.1 (16.5) μm, respectively) than parents (151.5 (14.0) and 220.6 (19.0) μm), yielding similar AVR (children 0.69 (0.05), parents 0.69 (0.06)). Correlation coefficients for parent-child pairs were 0.22 (95% CI 0.16 to 0.27) for CRAE, 0.23 (95% CI 0.17 to 0.28) for CRVE and 0.18 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.24) for AVR. Mother-child and father-child values were similar (0.20 and 0.32 for CRAE, 0.22 and 0.29 for CRVE, respectively). Relationships attenuated slightly on adjustment for age, sex, blood pressure, diabetes and body mass index. Percentiles and concordance are presented for the whole sample and by sex. Conclusions Arteriolar and venular calibre were similar to previously documented measures in midlife adult and late childhood populations. Population parent-child concordance values align with moderate polygenic heritability reported in smaller studies. ? 2019 BMJ.

"Cardiovascular and lifestyle risk factors and cognitive function in patients with stable coronary heart disease",2019,"Background-Vascular risk factors have been associated with differences in cognitive performance in epidemiological studies, but evidence in patients with coronary heart disease is more limited. Methods and Results-The Montreal Cognitive Assessment score obtained 3.2±0.37 years after randomization to darapladib, a reversible inhibitor of lipoprotein phospholipase A2 or placebo was evaluated for 10 634 patients with coronary heart disease from 38 countries in the STABILITY (Stabilization of Atherosclerotic Plaque by Initiation of Darapladib Therapy) trial. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores for darapladib and placebo groups were similar (mean±SD, 25.3±3.84 versus 25.4±3.73, respectively; P=0.27) and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for mild cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment score <26) was 1.00 (95% CI, 0.93-1.09). Mild cognitive impairment was more likely with increasing age (OR, 1.33 [1.27-1.41], +5 years after 65). For other baseline clinical characteristics, the strongest independent predictors of cognitive impairment were education (?8 years versus college/university, OR, 2.95 [2.60-3.35]; >8 years/trade school versus college/university, OR, 1.38 [1.25-1.52] and geographic grouping). Cardiovascular risk factors independently associated with cognitive impairment were history of stroke (OR, 1.43 [1.20-1.71]); <2.5 hours of moderate or vigorous intensity exercise/week (OR, 1.19 [1.04-1.37]); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol <1.16 mmol/L (OR, 1.19 [1.04-1.37]); diabetes mellitus requiring treatment (OR, yes versus no: 1.15 [1.05-1.26]); and history of hypertension (OR, 1.12 [1.02-1.23]). Conclusions-In patients with stable coronary heart disease, cognitive performance was associated with modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, educational level, and global region, but was not influenced by darapladib.

"Quantifying the potential for future gene therapy to lower lifetime risk of polygenic late-onset diseases",2019,"Gene therapy techniques and genetic knowledge may sufficiently advance, within the next few decades, to support prophylactic gene therapy for the prevention of polygenic late-onset diseases. The risk of these diseases may, hypothetically, be lowered by correcting the effects of a subset of common low effect gene variants. In this paper, simulations show that if such gene therapy were to become technically possible; and if the incidences of the treated diseases follow the proportional hazards model with a multiplicative genetic architecture composed of a sufficient number of common small effect gene variants, then: (a) late-onset diseases with the highest familial heritability will have the largest number of variants available for editing; (b) diseases that currently have the highest lifetime risk, particularly those with the highest incidence rate continuing into older ages, will prove the most challenging cases in lowering lifetime risk and delaying the age of onset at a population-wide level; (c) diseases that are characterized by the lowest lifetime risk will show the strongest and longest-lasting response to such therapies; and (d) longer life expectancy is associated with a higher lifetime risk of these diseases, and this tendency, while delayed, will continue after therapy. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Antisense oligonucleotide therapies for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis: Existing and emerging targets",2019,"Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a disease with highly heterogenous causes, most of which remain unknown, a multitude of possible disease mechanisms, and no therapy currently available that can halt disease progression. However, recent advances in antisense oligonucleotides have made them a viable option for targeted therapeutics for patients. These molecules offer a method of targeting RNA that is highly specific, adaptable, and does not require viral delivery. Antisense oligonucleotides are therefore being developed for several genetic causes of ALS. Furthermore, biological pathways involved in the pathogenesis of disease also offer tantalizing targets for intervention using antisense oligonucleotides. Here we detail existing and potential targets for antisense oligonucleotides in ALS and briefly examine the requirements for these drugs to reach and be effective in clinic. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","antisense oligonucleotide; RNA binding protein; antisense oligonucleotide; allele; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; antisense therapy; drug delivery system; drug targeting; human; nonhuman; Short Survey; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; chemistry; genetics; molecularly targeted therapy; procedures; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Drug Delivery Systems; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Oligonucleotides, Antisense"
"Cyclic glycine-proline administration normalizes high-fat diet-induced synaptophysin expression in obese rats",2019,"Childhood metabolic disorders are associated with insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 deficiency, which can adversely affect brain development and function. As a neuropeptide, cyclic glycine-proline (cGP) improves IGF-1 function in brain and regulates IGF-1 bioavailability in plasma. Whether such a regulatory process mediates the neurotrophic effects of cGP remains unknown. This study examined the effects cGP treatment on synaptic expression and their association with IGF-1, IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-2 and cGP concentrations in the brain of rats with high fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity. Male rats received either a HFD or a standard chow diet (STD) from weaning and were then treated with either saline or cGP from 11 to 15 weeks of age. The concentrations of cGP, IGF-1 and IGFBP-2 were measured in the brain tissues using ELISA and HPLC-MS. The expressions of synaptic markers were evaluated in the hippocampus, hypothalamus and striatum using immunohistochemical staining. Compared to the STD group, IGF-1 and IGFBP-2, but not cGP concentrations, were lower in the HFD groups. The expression of hippocampal synaptophysin, glutamate receptor-1, GFAP and striatal tyrosine-hydroxylase were also reduced in the HFD groups. While treatment did not alter tissue IGF-1, cGP administration that increased the concentration of cGP in brain tissues, normalized the expression of synaptophysin, GFAP and tyrosine-hydroxylase, but not glutamate receptor-1. IGF-1 concentration in brain tissues correlated with the expression of all synaptic markers. HFD feeding reduced synaptic expression and tissue IGF-1 in brains which were closely associated, thus suggesting IGF-1 in the brain is largely bioavailable. Without increasing IGF-1 in the brain, administration of cGP normalized synaptic expression, possibly be mediated through increasing bioavailable IGF-1, but further studies are required to confirm this. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","amino acid; cyclic glycine proline; glutamate receptor 1; somatomedin binding protein 2; somatomedin C; synaptophysin; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; unclassified drug; cyclic glycine-proline; cyclopeptide; insulin-like growth factor-1, rat; somatomedin C; synaptophysin; Syp protein, rat; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain tissue; chow diet; controlled study; corpus striatum; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; experimental obesity; hippocampus; hypothalamus; immunohistochemistry; lipid diet; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rat; weaning; animal; disease model; lipid diet; metabolism; obesity; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Diet, High-Fat; Disease Models, Animal; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Male; Obesity; Peptides, Cyclic; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Synaptophysin"
"The impact of diving on hearing: a 10-25 year audit of New Zealand professional divers",2019,"INTRODUCTION: Surveillance of professional divers' hearing is routinely undertaken on an annual basis despite lack of evidence of benefit to the diver. The aim of this study was to determine the magnitude and significance of changes in auditory function over a 10-25 year period of occupational diving with the intention of informing future health surveillance policy for professional divers. METHODS: All divers with adequate audiological records spanning at least 10 years were identified from the New Zealand occupational diver database. Changes in auditory function over time were compared with internationally accepted normative values. Any significant changes were tested for correlation with diving exposure, smoking history and body mass index. RESULTS: The audiological records of 227 professional divers were analysed for periods ranging from 10 to 25 years. Initial hearing was poorer than population norms, and deterioration over the observation period was less than that predicted by normative data. Changes in hearing were not related to diving exposure, or smoking history. CONCLUSION: Audiological changes over 10 to 25 years of occupational diving were not found to be significantly different from age-related changes. Routine annual audiological testing of professional divers does not appear to be justifiable.

"Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency Following Acute Pancreatitis: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",2019,"Background/Objectives: The epidemiology of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) after acute pancreatitis (AP) is uncertain. We sought to determine the prevalence, progression, etiology and pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) requirements for EPI during follow-up of AP by systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Scopus, Medline and Embase were searched for prospective observational studies or randomized clinical trials (RCTs) of PERT reporting EPI during the first admission (between the start of oral refeeding and before discharge) or follow-up (? 1?month of discharge) for AP in adults. EPI was diagnosed by direct and/or indirect laboratory exocrine pancreatic function tests. Results: Quantitative data were analyzed from 370 patients studied during admission (10 studies) and 1795 patients during follow-up (39 studies). The pooled prevalence of EPI during admission was 62% (95% confidence interval: 39–82%), decreasing significantly during follow-up to 35% (27–43%; risk difference: ? 0.34, ? 0.53 to ? 0.14). There was a two-fold increase in the prevalence of EPI with severe compared with mild AP, and it was higher in patients with pancreatic necrosis and those with an alcohol etiology. The prevalence decreased during recovery, but persisted in a third of patients. There was no statistically significant difference between EPI and new-onset pre-diabetes/diabetes (risk difference: 0.8, 0.7–1.1, P = 0.33) in studies reporting both. Sensitivity analysis showed fecal elastase-1 assay detected significantly fewer patients with EPI than other tests. Conclusions: The prevalence of EPI during admission and follow-up is substantial in patients with a first attack of AP. Unanswered questions remain about the way this is managed, and further RCTs are indicated. ? 2019, The Author(s).","alcohol; amino acid; ceruletide; cholecystokinin; chymotrypsin; elastase; pancreas enzyme; secretin; acute pancreatitis; Article; attributable risk; comparative study; conservative treatment; convalescence; diabetes mellitus; disease exacerbation; disease severity; Embase; endoscopic surgery; enzyme replacement; exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; follow up; hospital admission; hospital discharge; hospitalization; human; impaired glucose tolerance; infection complication; laboratory test; Medline; meta analysis; minimally invasive procedure; observational study; pancreas abscess; pancreas function; pancreas function test; pancreas necrosis; pancreas pseudocyst; pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy; percutaneous drainage; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; quality control; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); refeeding; Scopus; sensitivity analysis; systematic review; time to treatment; treatment duration; adult; aged; enzyme replacement; enzymology; exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; female; male; middle aged; pancreatitis; risk factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Enzyme Replacement Therapy; Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Observational Studies as Topic; Pancreatitis; Prevalence; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"The utility and safety of hypoxia experiences for rebreather divers",2019,"Background: Aircrew training often includes an hypoxic experience aimed at improving symptom recognition and selfrescue in a subsequent hypoxic event. Similar training has been advocated for rebreather divers. We investigated the effect of a prior hypoxic experience on actual and perceived cognitive function during subsequent hypoxia and measured the physiological responses to severe progressive hypoxia. Methods: Twenty-five subjects underwent two hypoxic hypoxia experiences (trials one and two) approximately five weeks apart. Subjects breathed 5.5% oxygen whilst performing a playing card recognition test. The primary endpoint was the time taken to make three consecutive errors in the card recognition test (time of useful consciousness, TUC). Secondary endpoints were the total number of errors made, accuracy of error recollection and physiological variables. Results: Mean (SD) TUC was 166 seconds (37) and 169 s (35), and subjects made 8.9 (2.4) and 7.8 (2.0) errors in trials one and two respectively. Error recall was identical between trials with participants failing to recall 6 (3) and 6 (2) errors made in trials one and two respectively. Across both trials mean nadir arterial blood and cerebral oxygen saturations were 52% and 49% respectively. The mean (SD) increase in heart rate was 42 (16) beats?min-1. Conclusion: An hypoxic experience did not improve cognitive performance or subject insight into performance in a second exposure five weeks later. Hypoxia imposes a significant physiological stress which may be hazardous in unscreened, nonmedically supervised subjects. Hypoxia experience training is not recommended for rebreather divers at this time. ? 2019, South Pacific Medicine Underwater Society and the European Underwater and Baromedical Society.

"Understanding Cerebellum in Vertebrate Neuroethology: From Sensing in Sharks and Electric Fish to Motor Sequences in Movement and Birdsong",2019,"The elaborate structure of the cerebellum has been long known, although its contribution to a remarkable diversity of behavior is only recently appreciated. Taking an evolutionary perspective, we consider the wider function of the cerebellum based on insight from the function of so-called cerebellum-like structures. Cerebellum-like structures cancel the effects of self-stimulation, a function that has been well characterized in both elasmobranch and weakly electric fish. This function depends on the implementation of an adaptive filter, which provides an input-output transformation modified by specific learning rules. We argue that the broad contribution of the cerebellum to behavior can be understood by thinking of the cerebellum as an array of adaptive filters that can be coopted to a wide range of tasks. Consistent with this, studies of mammalian cerebellum reveal operations characteristic of an adaptive filter, which we review here. We then describe a model for how a cerebellar adaptive filter architecture could interact with central pattern generators and sensory feedback to coordinate sequentially patterned behavior. Finally, we use the acquisition and production of complex vocal motor sequencing in birdsong as an example to explore how this model of cerebellar adaptive filter- central pattern generator interactions may contribute to other important domains of vertebrate neuroethology. ? 2019 American Psychological Association.","animal behavior; Article; basal ganglion; brain development; brain function; brain size; breathing mechanics; cell interaction; central pattern generator; cerebellar mossy fiber; cerebellum; cerebellum disease; cerebellum granular layer; cerebellum like adaptive filter; cerebellum like hindbrain structure; cerebellum like sensory structure; cerebellum nucleus; climbing fiber; conceptual framework; coughing; dendritic spine; dorsal octavolateralis nucleus; efferent nerve; electric field; electric fish; electroreceptor; electrosensory system; evolutionary adaptation; excitatory postsynaptic potential; eyelid reflex; forebrain; functional connectivity; Golgi cell; hand movement; head movement; hearing; human; interneuron; locomotion; mathematical analysis; medial octavolateralis nucleus; motor activity; motor control; motor coordination; movement perception; nerve cell plasticity; nerve conduction; nonhuman; octavolateralis sense; pathophysiology; predictive cancellation; premotor cortex; proprioception; Purkinje cell; self generated reafference; self stimulation; sensory evoked potential; sensory feedback; sensory nerve; sensory nerve cell; sensory stimulation; sensory system; shark; signal transduction; songbird; subsumption layer control; synaptic transmission; thalamus; vertebrate neuroethology; vestibuloocular reflex; vocal learning; vocalization; voluntary movement; algorithm; animal; biological model; bird; cerebellum; computer simulation; electric fish; ethology; evolution; learning; metabolism; motor activity; movement (physiology); nerve cell; physiology; procedures; shark; Algorithms; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Biological Evolution; Birds; Cerebellum; Computer Simulation; Electric Fish; Ethology; Learning; Models, Neurological; Motor Activity; Movement; Neuronal Plasticity; Neurons; Sharks"
"Phenomenological approach to childhood cataract treatment in New Zealand using semi-structured interviews: How might we improve provision of care",2019,"Purpose To understand how we might improve the provision of medical care for children with cataracts. Design A phenomenological design was employed. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to capture rich descriptions of the phenomena. Our goal in the interview and the analysis was to understand the sources of distress associated with treatment for cataract and deprivation amblyopia which (1) could be addressed by the medical community and (2) related to treatment adherence. Setting Interviews were conducted by a non-clinician researcher in New Zealand (NZ) in a location chosen by informants. In NZ, the red reflex screening test is performed shortly after birth, and surgery to remove paediatric cataracts is publicly funded. Participants Families of children who had a history of cataract in Auckland, NZ were posted an invitation to participate. Twenty families were interviewed. Results Our analysis illustrated that informants described a wide range of experiences, from declined cataract surgery to full adherence to medical advice including years of patching for more than 4 hours a day. Across these experiences, we identified three relevant themes; timing of diagnosis, communication between the parent and clinician, and parental social support networks. Conclusion The medical community may be better placed to support families dealing with childhood cataract by improving detection of childhood cataract, building appropriate communication pathways and promoting social support, with an emphasis on empathetic, individualised care. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).","amblyopia; Article; cataract; cataract extraction; child; childhood disease; cornea reflex; distress syndrome; family history; health care quality; human; New Zealand; patient compliance; pediatric surgery; pediatrician; personal experience; phenomenology; prognosis; red light; screening test; semi structured interview; social network; social support; vision test"
"Correcting for Body Surface Area Identifies the True Prevalence of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm in Screened Women",2019,"Objective: Recently, the prevalence of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) using screening strategies based on elevated cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk was reported. AAA was defined as a diameter ?30 mm, with prevalence of 6.1% and 1.8% in men and women respectively, consistent with the widely reported AAA predominant prevalence in males. Given the obvious differences in body size between sexes this study aimed to re-evaluate the expanded CVD risk based AAA screening dataset to determine the effect of body size on sex specific AAA prevalence. Methods: Absolute (26 and 30 mm) and relative (aortic size index [ASI] equals the maximum infrarenal aorta diameter (cm) divided by body surface area (m 2 ), ASI ? 1.5) thresholds were used to assess targeted AAA screening groups (n = 4115) and compared with a self reported healthy elderly control group (n = 800). Results: Male AAA prevalence was the same using either the 30 mm or ASI ?1.5 aneurysm definitions (5.7%). In females, AAA prevalence was significantly different between the 30 mm (2.4%) and ASI ? 1.5 (4.5%) or the 26 mm (4.4%) thresholds. Conclusion: The results suggest the purported male predominance in AAA prevalence is primarily an artefact of body size differences. When aortic size is adjusted for body surface area there is only a modest sex difference in AAA prevalence. This observation has potential implications in the context of the ongoing discussion regarding AAA screening in women. ? 2018 European Society for Vascular Surgery","abdominal aortic aneurysm; age; aged; aorta; Article; body size; body surface; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary angiography; diabetes mellitus; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical history; priority journal; sex difference; smoking; abdominal aortic aneurysm; age distribution; mass screening; New Zealand; prevalence; procedures; risk assessment; sex ratio; Age Distribution; Aortic Aneurysm, Abdominal; Body Surface Area; Confounding Factors (Epidemiology); Female; Humans; Mass Screening; New Zealand; Prevalence; Risk Assessment; Sex Distribution"
"Screening of in vitro health benefits of tangerine tomatoes",2019,"Tomatoes have been associated with various health benefits, including the prevention of chronic diseases. The cis-isomers of lycopene occurring in tangerine tomatoes were, through clinical trials, proven to be more bioavailable than the all-trans lycopene found in red tomatoes. Nonetheless, scientific evidence regarding the bioactivities of the tangerine tomatoes is lacking. In this article, the antioxidant, anticancer, and anti-inflammatory properties of extracts prepared from four different tomato varieties, namely Alfred, Olga’s Round Golden Chicken Egg, Golden Green, and Golden Eye, were investigated. While the antioxidant capacities of the extracts were measured through the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) and 2,2’-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid) (ABTS) assays, their anti-proliferative properties in prostate cancer cell lines were examined through the Sulforhodamine-B (SRB) assay. The anti-inflammatory activities of the extracts were assessed through the toll-like receptor (TLR)2, TLR4, and nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain containing protein 2 (NOD2)-mediated inflammatory pathways. Our results show that the tangerine tomatoes had lower IC50 values in both the anticancer and anti-inflammatory assays compared to the red tomatoes. Specifically, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of the tangerine tomatoes in LNCaP cells were approximately two to three fold lower than the red tomato (IC50: 14.46, 5.62, and 8.08 mg dry tomato equivalent/mL from Alfred hexane-acetone, Olga’s Round Golden Chicken Egg hexane, and Golden Green hexane, respectively). These findings indicate that the tangerine varieties, Olga’s Round Golden Chicken Egg and Golden Green, possess greater potential to be used in conjunction with treatment and for the prevention of cancer and inflammatory-related diseases than the Alfred (red) and Golden Eye (high beta-carotene) varieties. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Postgraduate work-based learning: a qualitative study",2019,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the experiences of students and teachers who had participated in a postgraduate work-based praxis course within a Master of mental health practice qualification. Design/methodology/approach: This qualitative study used an interpretative phenomenological approach to understand the lived experience of students and course convenors participating in a work-based praxis course. Seven students and two convenors were recruited. Interview and reflective portfolio data were analysed thematically. Findings: The main themes identified were the importance of planning, the value of partnerships, the significance of learning in the workplace and how the facilitation of work-based learning differs from coursework. Originality/value: Work-based learning within postgraduate coursework qualifications can support higher-level learning, knowledge and skills has received limited attention in the literature. This study supported the value of providing postgraduate students with work-based learning opportunities, resulting in the application of new or advanced skills, within their existing work roles. This study is important, because it provides insights into the student experience of postgraduate work-based learning and the impact of this learning on professional practice. ? 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",""
"Is evaluation obsolete in a post-truth world?",2019,"The contemporary post-truth phenomenon is characterised by denial of facts and tolerance of politicians’ lies. It has enhanced the appeal of authoritarian and nationalist leaders as a populist reaction to policy failures. While emerging market countries hugely benefited from globalization, the hourly wages of working people in high-income countries have stagnated while inequality has surged, and environmental stresses have escalated. Post-truth dispositions are distorting decision making in the public sphere and they have increased public distrust of knowledge professionals. This is likely to aggravate the very problems that gave rise to the post-truth phenomenon. Evaluation can help reverse the trends that underlie voters’ anxieties, amplification of tribal prejudices and appeals to national pride through sound advice, transparency and public education. This will require new evaluation policy directions. Evaluation internationalization, diversification, democratization and professionalization will have to take place simultaneously. ? 2018","authoritarianism; decision making; democracy; democratization; globalization; nationalism; populism; psychology; wage; anxiety; article; decision making; democracy; education; environmental stress; high income country; human; leadership; market; prejudice; public figure; sound; health care policy; politics; procedures; program evaluation; Health Policy; Humans; Politics; Program Evaluation"
"Health service provider responses to indigenous peoples with cancer: An integrative review",2019,"Indigenous populations around the world have a higher burden of cancer incidence, severity and mortality. This integrative review aims to identify and appraise the evidence of health providers’ responses to the issue of indigenous peoples with cancer. A surprisingly small number of studies were found (n?=?9) that reported on programmes and interventions for indigenous people with cancer, the majority of which were from the USA. Our review shows that a service delivery approach that is focused on the indigenous population and includes culturally appropriate activities, resources and environments resulted in an increase in cancer knowledge, reduction in treatment interruption, improved access to cancer care and enrolment in clinical cancer trials, and increased satisfaction with health care. However, the question of why there are so few published studies needs further consideration. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","article; cancer incidence; clinical article; clinical trial (topic); controlled study; health care delivery; human; indigenous people; mortality; satisfaction; treatment interruption; adult; aged; caregiver; ethnology; health care disparity; indigenous health care; middle aged; neoplasm; patient attitude; population group; standards; statistics and numerical data; telemedicine; young adult; Adult; Aged; Caregivers; Delivery of Health Care; Health Services, Indigenous; Healthcare Disparities; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Population Groups; Telemedicine; Young Adult"
"A primary care programme to improve identification and stepped-care support of Asians with mental health and lifestyle issues",2019,"Introduction: Asians living in Western countries have a higher incidence of mental health and lifestyle issues, but are less likely to disclose these to health-care professionals due to stigma. Instead, they tend to present to primary care with somatic concerns. AIM: To assess the feasibility and acceptability of a well-validated electronic screening and stepped-care support tool (eCHAT) to identify mental health and lifestyle issues among Asian patients. METHODS: A mixed-methods (interviews and survey) co-design approach explored patient and clinic staff perspectives on a translated version of eCHAT (AsiaCHAT). Recruitment was through a large primary care organisation with a high proportion of Asian patients. Of the 307 approached, 277 participated (92% acceptance rate). RESULTS: Problems of depression (n = 12) and anxiety (n = 69) were identified among patients, as were sexual health concerns (n = 22) among younger participants. Overall, participants and clinic staff rated AsiaCHAT as a useful and acceptable tool for disclosing and discussing patient concerns. Problems of finances, time constraints and competing demands made long-term implementation challenging. DISCUSSION: AsiaCHAT is a promising tool for identifying mental health and lifestyle concerns among Asians presenting to primary care. The electronic screener supports patient and provider discussion of sensitive topics and the stepped-care support function helps direct care. Its flexible functionality means that there is potential to integrate it into busy clinic settings as well as online patient portals, and the programme aligns with current policy to improve Asian health in New Zealand. ?

"Enumerating the population eligible for funded HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) in New Zealand",2019,"Background: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) became publicly funded in New Zealand (NZ) on 1 March 2018. PrEP could have a substantial population-level effect on HIV transmission if scaled up rapidly. An accurate estimate of the size of the PrEP-eligible population would guide implementation. Methods: We drew on nine sources to estimate the PrEP-eligible population, namely Statistics NZ data, Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC) data on adults receiving funded antiretroviral treatment (ART), expert advice, estimates of the HIV care cascade, surveillance of undiagnosed HIV in a community sample of gay and bisexual men (GBM), surveillance of HIV diagnoses, NZ Health Survey data on sexual orientation among males, behavioural surveillance among GBM and behavioural data among people living with HIV (PLWH) from the HIV Futures NZ study. From these sources we derived three estimates relating to GBM, non-GBM and total eligible population. Sensitivity analyses examined different assumptions (GBM denominators, proportion PLWH diagnosed, proportion of diagnosed PLWH treated). Results: We estimated that 17.9% of sexually active HIV-negative GBM would be eligible for PrEP, equating to 5816 individuals. We estimated that 31 non-GBM individuals would be eligible for PrEP. Thus, in total, 5847 individuals would be eligible for PrEP, comprising 99.5% GBM and 0.5% non-GBM. Sensitivity analyses ranged from 3062 to 6718 individuals. Conclusions: Policy makers can use enumeration to monitor the speed and scale in coverage as implementation of publicly funded PrEP proceeds. Sexual health and primary care services can use enumeration to forecast PrEP demand and plan accordingly. Better quality data, especially on transgender adults in NZ, would improve the accuracy of estimates. ? 2019 CSIRO.","Article; erratum"
"Socio-economic status and behavioural and cardiovascular risk factors in papua new guinea: A cross-sectional survey",2019,"Background Risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD) are negatively correlated with socio-economic status (SES) in high-income countries (HIC) but there has been little research on their distribution by household SES within low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Considering the limited data from LMICs, this paper examines the association between behavioural and cardiovascular risk factors and household SES in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Methods Reported here are results of 671 participants from the 900 randomly selected adults aged 15–65 years. These adults were recruited from three socioeconomically and geographically diverse surveillance sites (peri-urban community, rural Highland and an Island community) in PNG in 2013–2014. We measured their CVD risk factors (behavioural and metabolic) using a modified WHO STEPS risk factor survey and analysis of blood samples. We assessed SES by education, occupation and creating a household wealth index based on household assets. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) using a generalized linear model to assess the associations between risks and SES. Findings Elevated CVD risk factors were common in all SES groups but the CVD metabolic risk factors were most prevalent among homemakers, peri-urban and rural highlands, and the highest (4th and 5th) wealth quintile population. Adults in the highest wealth quintile had high risks of obesity, elevated HbA1c and metabolic syndrome (MetS) that were greater than those in the lowest quintile although those in the highest wealth quintiles were less likely to smoke tobacco. Compared to people from the Island community, peri-urban residents had increased risks of increased waist circumference (WC) (RR: 1.67, 95%CI: 1.21–2.31), hypertension (RR: 229, 95%CI: 189–4.56), high cholesterol (RR: 222, 95%CI: 120–410), high triglycerides (RR: 149, 95%CI: 117–191), elevated HbA1c (RR: 554, 95%CI: 136–2156), and Metabolic syndrome (MetS) (RR: 204, 95%CI: 125–332). Similarly, Rural Highland residents had increased risk of obesity (Waist Circumference RR: 170, 95%CI: 121–338, Waist-Hip-Ratio RR:148, 95%CI: 128–170), hypertension (RR: 260, 95%CI: 171–395), high triglycerides (RR: 134, 95%CI: 106–170) and MetS (RR: 188, 95%CI: 112–316) compared to those in the rural Island site. Interpretation CVD risk factors are common in PNG adults but their association with SES varies markedly and by location. Our findings show that all community members are at risk of CVD weather they are part of high or low SES groups. These results support the notion that the association between CVD risk factors and SES differ greatly accordingly to the type of SES measure used, risk factors and the population studied. In addition, our findings contribute further to the limited literature in LMIC. Longitudinal studies are needed to monitor changes in rapidly changing societies such as PNG to inform public health policy for control and prevention of NCDs in the country. ? 2019 Rarau et al.

"High prevalence of slight and mild hearing loss across mid-life: a cross-sectional national Australian study",2019,"Objectives: Although presbycusis typically becomes symptomatic only in older age, slight and mild hearing loss may be detectable well before this. We studied current prevalence and characteristics of hearing loss in Australian mid-life adults. Study design: This was a population-derived national cross-sectional study nested within the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children. Methods: A total of 1485 parents/guardians (87.3% female) aged 30–59 years underwent air-conduction audiometry. Hearing loss was defined in three ways to maximize cross-study comparability: high Fletcher index (mean of 1, 2 and 4 kHz; primary outcome relevant to speech perception), lower frequency (mean of 1 and 2 kHz) and higher frequency (mean of 4 and 8 kHz). Multivariable logistic regression examined how losses vary by age, sex and neighbourhood disadvantage. Results: On high Fletcher index, 27.3% had bilateral and 23.8% unilateral thresholds >15 dB hearing level (HL) (slight or worse), and 4.9% had bilateral and 6.3% unilateral thresholds >25 dB HL (mild or worse). Bilateral higher frequency losses were more common than lower frequency losses for thresholds >15 dB HL (30.9% vs. 26.4%) and >25 dB HL (11.0% vs. 4.6%). Age increased the risk of bilateral speech and higher frequency losses (all P for trend < 0.05), but not lower frequency losses >25 dB HL. Although sex was not associated with speech and lower frequency losses, men were more likely to have bilateral higher frequency losses (e.g. >15 dB HL: odds ratio [OR]: 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.5–3.2, P < 0.001). Conclusions: Both slight and mild hearing loss show high and rising prevalence across mid-life. This offers opportunities to prevent progression to reduce the profound later burden of age-related hearing loss. ? 2018 The Royal Society for Public Health","adult; hearing; public health; risk factor; adult; age; air conduction; Article; audiometry; auditory threshold; Australian; bilateral hearing loss; clinical assessment tool; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease severity; female; Fletcher index; frequency modulation; hearing impairment; high risk patient; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; outcome assessment; population research; prevalence; sex; speech perception; unilateral hearing loss; Australia; hearing impairment; middle aged; prevalence; severity of illness index; Australia; Adult; Australia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hearing Loss; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Severity of Illness Index"
"The clinical implications of computerised fluid dynamic modelling in rhinology",2019,"Background: The nose is a dynamic organ and is the first point of contact between inhaled air and mucosal surfaces. Within the nasal cavity, there are changes of air flow and pressure occurring during the respiratory cycle, as well as exchanges of heat and humidity, and important immune responses to inhaled antigens and allergens. Methodology: This review is a summary for rhinologists covering what is known about airflow within the nose and sinuses and the impact of pathology and treatments on the physical environment of the nasal cavity. The review will concentrate largely on the significant contribution that computational fluid dynamics has had on this field. Results: The complex anatomical structure of the nasal cavity provides an aerodynamic environment that guides the airflow throughout the nasal cavities. However, anatomical or inflammatory changes can modify the air flow, heat and humidity exchanges, with negative consequences on nasal physiology. Restoration of normal airflow is a key goal to achieve success in the treatment of nasal diseases. Conclusions: Computational fluid dynamics is a method of analysis originating from engineering which has been adapted for rhinology. Although still an expensive and laborious technique, it may become a viable diagnostic tool in the future for studying nasal physiology. ? 2019, International Rhinologic Society.

"Comparison of major protein-source foods and other food groups in meat-eaters and non-meat-eaters in the epic-oxford cohort",2019,"Differences in health outcomes between meat-eaters and non-meat-eaters might relate to differences in dietary intakes between these diet groups. We assessed intakes of major protein-source foods and other food groups in six groups of meat-eaters and non-meat-eaters participating in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Oxford study. The data were from 30,239 participants who answered questions regarding their consumption of meat, fish, dairy or eggs and completed a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) in 2010. Participants were categorized as regular meat-eaters, low meat-eaters, poultry-eaters, fish-eaters, vegetarians and vegans. FFQ foods were categorized into 45 food groups and analysis of variance was used to test for differences between age-adjusted mean intakes of each food group by diet group. Regular meat-eaters, vegetarians and vegans, respectively, consumed about a third, quarter and a fifth of their total energy intake from high protein-source foods. Compared with regular meat-eaters, low and non-meat-eaters consumed higher amounts of high-protein meat alternatives (soy, legumes, pulses, nuts, seeds) and other plant-based foods (whole grains, vegetables, fruits) and lower amounts of refined grains, fried foods, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages.

"Eczema-protective probiotic alters infant gut microbiome functional capacity but not composition: Sub-sample analysis from a RCT",2019,"Probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001 given in early life has been shown to reduce infant eczema risk, but its effect on gut microbiota development has not been quantitatively and functionally examined. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early life probiotic exposure on the composition and functional capacity of infant gut microbiota from birth to 2 years considering the effects of age, delivery mode, antibiotics, pets and eczema. We performed shotgun metagenomic sequencing analysis of 650 infant faecal samples, collected at birth, 3, 12, and 24 months, as part of a randomised, controlled, 3-arm trial assessing the effect of L. rhamnosus HN001, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis HN019 supplementation on eczema development in 474 infants. There was a 50% reduced eczema risk in the HN001 probiotic group compared to placebo. Both mothers (from 35 weeks gestation until 6 months post-partum if breastfeeding) and infants (from birth to 2 years) received either a placebo or one of two probiotics, L. rhamnosus HN001 (6×109 cfu), or B. animalis subsp. lactis HN019 (9×109 cfu). L. rhamnosus HN001 probiotic supplementation was associated with increased overall glycerol-3 phosphate transport capacity and enrichment of L. rhamnosus. There were no other significant changes in infant gut microbiota composition or diversity. Increased capacity to transport glycerol-3-phosphate was positively correlated with relative abundance of L. rhamnosus. Children who developed eczema had gut microbiota with increased capacity for glycosaminoglycan degradation and flagellum assembly but had no significant differences in microbiota composition or diversity. Early life HN001 probiotic use is associated with both increased L. rhamnosus and increased infant gut microbiota functional capacity to transport glycerol-3 phosphate. The mechanistic relationship of such functional alteration in gut microbiota with reduced eczema risk and long-term health merits further investigation. ? 2019 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","antibiotic agent; glycerophosphate; glycosaminoglycan; placebo; probiotic agent; probiotic agent; age; Article; bacterial flagellum; bacterial overgrowth; Bifidobacterium animalis; cesarean section; child; DNA sequence; eczema; Escherichia; female; human; infant; intestine flora; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; male; metagenomics; newborn; post hoc analysis; pregnant woman; randomized controlled trial (topic); adult; atopic dermatitis; breast feeding; controlled study; dietary supplement; feces; intestine flora; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; metabolism; microbiology; mother; physiology; preschool child; puerperium; randomized controlled trial; transport at the cellular level; Adult; Age Factors; Biological Transport; Breast Feeding; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dietary Supplements; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Glycerophosphates; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lactobacillus rhamnosus; Metagenomics; Mothers; Postpartum Period; Probiotics"
"Outcomes in different ethnic groups of New Zealand patients with screen-detected vs. non-screen-detected breast cancer",2019,"Objective: To compare characteristics and survival of New Zealand European, M?ori, and Pacific women with screen-detected vs. non-screen-detected breast cancer. Methods: Women aged 45–69 diagnosed with invasive breast cancer between January 2005 and May 2013 were identified from the Waikato and Auckland Breast Cancer Registries. Patient demographics and tumour characteristics were described by detection mode and ethnicity. Kaplan–Meier method was used to estimate the five-year breast cancer-specific survival of women with stage I–III breast cancer by ethnicity and detection mode. Results: Women with screen-detected cancers were older, had smaller tumours, fewer stage IV (0.8% vs. 7.6%), fewer high grade (16.8% vs. 39.0%), and fewer lymph node positive diseases (26.3% vs. 51.5%) than women with non-screen-detected cancers. There were more Luminal A (70.0% vs. 54.0%), fewer human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive non-Luminal (4.4% vs. 8.8%), and fewer triple negative cases (7.0% vs. 13.8%) in screen-detected than non-screen-detected cancers. If not screen detected, 22.7% of breast cancers in Pacific women were stage IV compared with 2.4% if screen detected. If not screen detected, the five-year breast cancer-specific survival was 91.1% for New Zealand European women, 84.2% for M?ori women, and 80.2% for Pacific women (p-value <0.001). For screen-detected breast cancer, survival between different ethnic groups was similar. Conclusions: Breast cancers detected through screening are diagnosed at an earlier stage and have a greater proportion of subtypes, with better outcome. Variations in survival for M?ori and Pacific women are only found in women with non-screen-detected breast cancer. ? The Author(s) 2019.",""

Bone mineral densities (BMDs) of the lumbar spine (LS), femoral neck (FN), and whole body (WB) were assessed at baseline and week 52 using GE Lunar iDEXA (GE Healthcare, Madison, WI). At baseline, WB lean mass was positively associated with LS BMD (r = 0.30, p < 0.001) and FN BMD (r = 0.33, p = 0.003). Baseline 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels were 48.6 and 53.2 nmol/L (p = 0.57), respectively, and after the 12 months at 60.8 nmol/L (Int) versus 55.0 nmol/L (controls; p < 0.05 for change from baseline for both groups; no difference between groups at week 52). PTH levels decreased in both groups compared to baseline (p < 0.001), with no significant difference between groups. WB bone mineral content (BMC) and FN Z-score increased significantly in the Int group (p = 0.024 and p = 0.008). GS was positively associated with body weight, increasing in both groups over 52 weeks. Fortified milk improved vitamin D status, WB BMC, and Z-score of the FN, while regular milk maintained BMD. In addition, vitamin D status and GS improved. ? Marlena C.

"The active site of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis branched-chain amino acid biosynthesis enzyme dihydroxyacid dehydratase contains a 2Fe-2S cluster",2019,"Iron-sulfur clusters are protein cofactors with an ancient evolutionary origin. These clusters are best known for their roles in redox proteins such as ferredoxins, but some iron-sulfur clusters have nonredox roles in the active sites of enzymes. Such clusters are often prone to oxidative degradation, making the enzymes difficult to characterize. Here we report a structural and functional characterization of dihydroxyacid dehydratase (DHAD) from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), an essential enzyme in the biosynthesis of branched-chain amino acids. Conducting this analysis under fully anaerobic conditions, we solved the DHAD crystal structure, at 1.88 ? resolution, revealing a 2Fe-2S cluster in which one iron ligand is a potentially exchangeable water molecule or hydroxide. UV and EPR spectroscopy both suggested that the substrate binds directly to the cluster or very close to it. Kinetic analysis implicated two ionizable groups in the catalytic mechanism, which we postulate to be Ser-491 and the iron-bound water/hydroxide. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that Ser-491 is essential for activity, and substrate docking indicated that this residue is perfectly placed for proton abstraction. We found that a bound Mg2+ ion 6.5 ? from the 2Fe-2S cluster plays a key role in substrate binding. We also identified a putative entry channel that enables access to the cluster and show that Mtb-DHAD is inhibited by a recently discovered herbicide, aspterric acid, that, given the essentiality of DHAD for Mtb survival, is a potential lead compound for the design of novel anti-TB drugs. ? 2019 Bashiri et al.

"Predictors of functional improvement in people with chronic low back pain following a graded Pilates-based exercise programme",2019,"Background: Several studies have investigated subgroups of patients with low back pain (LBP) most likely to benefit from Pilates or movement control exercises, but none have determined prognostic factors specifically for chronic LBP. This prospective cohort study aimed to determine predictors of change in disability in people with chronic LBP following a Pilates-based exercise programme and reports summarised integrated prediction statistics to aid clinical utility for determination of subgroups likely to benefit or not benefit from treatment. Methods: Healthy adults (n = 55) with non-specific chronic LBP undertook a graded 6-week programme involving two 1-hour Pilates sessions/week (1 mat and 1 equipment-based) led in small groups by a trained Pilates instructor. Predictors of change in Patient-Specific Functional Scale (PSFS) were identified through regression analysis and used to develop clinical prediction statistics. Results: Clinically important improvement (n = 14 of 48 analysed) was predicted by four variables: gradual rather than sudden onset of LBP, PSFS &lt;3.7 points, absence of aberrant motions on forward bending, and body mass index &gt;24.5 kg/m2. Presence of ?3 improved probability of success from 29% to 73%. Failure to improve (n = 18) was predicted by three variables: sudden onset of low back pain, patient-specific functional score ?3.7, and difference between left and right active straight leg raise &gt;7°. Presence of all three increased probability of failure from 38% to 80%. Conclusions: A combination of five, easily measured variables were able to predict disability outcome following a graded programme of Pilates-based exercises in people with chronic LBP. Two common movement deficits were inversely related to positive changes in function which may call into question the structural mechanism of improvements observed.

"Antiviral Activity, Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Capsid Assembly Modulator NVR 3-778 in Patients with Chronic HBV Infection",2019,"Background &amp; Aims: NVR 3-778 is a first-in-class hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid assembly modulator that can inhibit HBV replication. We performed a proof-of-concept study to examine the safety, pharmacokinetics, and antiviral activity of NVR 3-778 in patients with chronic HBV infection. Methods: We performed a phase 1 study in 73 hepatitis B envelope antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients with chronic HBV infection without cirrhosis. In a 2-part study (part 1 in New Zealand and part 2 in Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, and the United States), patients were randomly assigned to groups that were given oral NVR 3-778 (100 mg, 200 mg, or 400 mg daily or 600 mg or 1000 mg twice daily) or placebo for 4 weeks. Additional groups received combination treatment with pegylated interferon (pegIFN) and NVR 3-778 (600 mg twice daily) or pegIFN with placebo. Results: Reductions in serum levels of HBV DNA and HBV RNA were observed in patients receiving ?1200 mg/d NVR 3-778. The largest mean reduction in HBV DNA was observed in the group given NVR 3-778 plus pegIFN (1.97 log 10 IU/mL), compared with the groups given NVR 3-778 or pegIFN alone (1.43 log 10 IU/mL and 1.06 log 10 IU/mL, respectively). The mean reduction in HBV RNA was also greatest in the group given NVR 3-778 plus pegIFN (2.09 log 10 copies/mL), compared with the groups given NVR 3-778 or pegIFN alone (1.42 log 10 copies/mL and 0.89 log 10 copies/mL, respectively). There was no significant mean reduction in HBsAg during the 4-week treatment period. There were no discontinuations and no pattern of dose-related adverse effects with NVR 3-778. Conclusions: In a phase 1 study of HBeAg-positive patients with chronic HBV infection without cirrhosis, NVR 3-778 was well tolerated and demonstrated antiviral activity. The agent reduced serum levels of HBV DNA and HBV RNA, to the greatest extent in combination with pegIFN. The observed reductions in HBV RNA confirmed the novel mechanism of NVR 3-778.

"Follow-up at 1?year and beyond of women with gestational diabetes treated with insulin and/or oral glucose-lowering agents: a core outcome set using a Delphi survey",2019,"Aims/hypothesis: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is linked with a higher lifetime risk for the development of impaired fasting glucose, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes, the metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, postpartum depression and tumours. Despite this, there is no consistency in the long-term follow-up of women with a previous diagnosis of GDM. Further, the outcomes selected and reported in the research involving this population are heterogeneous and lack standardisation. This amplifies the risk of reporting bias and diminishes the likelihood of significant comparisons between studies. The aim of this study is to develop a core outcome set (COS) for RCTs and other studies evaluating the long-term follow-up at 1?year and beyond of women with previous GDM treated with insulin and/oral glucose-lowering agents. Methods: The study consisted of three work packages: (1) a systematic review of the outcomes reported in previous RCTs of the follow-up at 1?year and beyond of women with GDM treated with insulin and/or oral glucose-lowering agents; (2) a three-round online Delphi survey with key stakeholders to prioritise these outcomes; and (3) a consensus meeting where the final COS was decided. Results: Of 3344 abstracts identified and evaluated, 62 papers were retrieved and 25/62 papers were included in this review. A total of 121 outcomes were identified and included in the Delphi survey. Delphi round 1 was emailed to 835 participants and 288 (34.5%) responded. In round 2, 190 of 288 (65.9%) participants responded and in round 3, 165 of 190 (86.8%) participants responded. In total, nine outcomes were selected and agreed for inclusion in the final COS: assessment of glycaemic status; diagnosis of type 2 diabetes since the index pregnancy; number of pregnancies since the index pregnancy; number of pregnancies with a diagnosis of GDM since the index pregnancy; diagnosis of prediabetes since the index pregnancy; BMI; post-pregnancy weight retention; resting blood pressure; and breastfeeding. Conclusions/interpretation: This study identified a COS that will help bring consistency and uniformity to outcome selection and reporting in clinical trials and other studies involving the follow-up at 1?year and beyond of women diagnosed with GDM treated with insulin and/or oral glucose-lowering agents during pregnancy. ? 2019, The Author(s).","glucose; insulin; oral antidiabetic agent; Article; body weight; breast feeding; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; core outcome set; Delphi study; diastolic blood pressure; female; follow up; glucose blood level; human; impaired glucose tolerance; long term care; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; online analysis; outcome assessment; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; systolic blood pressure; treatment duration"
"Enhancing T cell responses and tumour immunity by vaccination with peptides conjugated to a weak NKT cell agonist",2019,"Activated NKT cells can stimulate antigen-presenting cells leading to enhanced peptide antigen-specific immunity. However, administration of potent NKT cell agonists like α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer) can be associated with release of high levels of cytokines, and in some situations, hepatotoxicity. Here we show that it is possible to provoke sufficient NKT cell activity to stimulate strong antigen-specific T cell responses without these unwanted effects. This was achieved by chemically conjugating antigenic peptides to α-galactosylphytosphingosine (α-GalPhs), an NKT cell agonist with very weak activity based on structural characterisation and biological assays. Conjugation improved delivery to antigen-presenting cells in vivo, while use of a cathepsin-sensitive linker to release the α-GalPhs and peptide within the same cell promoted strong T cell activation and therapeutic anti-tumour responses in mice. The conjugates activated human NKT cells and enhanced human T cell responses to a viral peptide in vitro. Accordingly, we have demonstrated a means to safely exploit the immunostimulatory properties of NKT cells to enhance T cell activation for virus- and tumour-specific immunity. ? 2019 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Antigens; Chemical activation; Mammals; Peptides; T-cells; Tumors; Viruses; Activity-based; Antigen presenting cells; Antigenic peptides; Biological assays; Hepatotoxicity; T cell activation; T-cell response; Viral peptides; Cytology; cancer vaccine; CD1d antigen; CD1d antigen, mouse; epitope; glycolipid; immunological adjuvant; peptide; animal; antigen presenting cell; C57BL mouse; chemistry; drug effect; experimental neoplasm; immunology; lymphocyte activation; mouse; natural killer T cell; toxic hepatitis; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Animals; Antigen-Presenting Cells; Antigens, CD1d; Cancer Vaccines; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Epitopes; Glycolipids; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Natural Killer T-Cells; Neoplasms, Experimental; Peptides"
"International Perspectives on Old Age Psychiatry Training",2019,"Psychiatry of old age is a psychiatric subspecialty that has been developed in many countries since the 1950s as an attempt to improve the care of older adults with mental health disorders. Psychiatry of old age specialist training programs were subsequently established to develop a medical workforce that has the required competencies to work in this subspecialty. This article describes the psychiatry of old age specialist training programs in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. These training programs have varying durations, ranging from 1 to 3 years. Although it may not be a mandatory requirement to complete a psychiatry of old age clinical rotation, psychiatry of old age experience and competencies are expected during general psychiatry training. There is generally a lack of opportunity to learn about other clinical specialties relevant to older adults, such as geriatric medicine and neurology. Finally, much work is needed to better coordinate psychiatry of old age specialist training positions, workforce development, and service delivery to ensure there is a sufficient supply of psychiatry of old age specialists to meet the mental health needs of older adults in different countries in the coming years. ? 2018 American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry","Australia; geriatrics; health care delivery; human; medical education; medical specialist; mental health; Mexico; New Zealand; psychiatry; Review; senescence; United Kingdom; workforce"
