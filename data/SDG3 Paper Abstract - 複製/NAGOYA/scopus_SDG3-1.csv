Here we show that a fraction of mature miRNAs including miR-17-5p, -21-5p, and -200c-3p and let-7a-5p harbor methyl marks that potentially alter their stability and target recognition. Importantly, methylation of these miRNAs was significantly increased in cancer tissues as compared to paired normal tissues. Furthermore, miR-17-5p methylation level in serum samples distinguished early pancreatic cancer patients from healthy controls with extremely high sensitivity and specificity. These findings provide a basis for diagnostic strategies for early-stage cancer and add a dimension to our understanding of miRNA biology. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,"biological marker; epidermal growth factor; microRNA; RNA methyltransferase; microRNA; MIRN17 microRNA, human; MIRN200 microRNA, human; MIRN21 microRNA, human; tumor marker; biology; cancer; methylation; protein; RNA; serum; Article; binding site; bioinformatics; body mass; BxPC-3 cell line; cancer diagnosis; Capan-2 cell line; cell culture technique; chemical modification; clinical article; colorectal cancer; controlled study; digestive system cancer; gene expression; genetic transfection; HCT 116 cell line; high throughput sequencing; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoprecipitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; microarray analysis; nucleotide sequence; Panc 10.05 cell line; PSN1 cell line; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA methylation; RNA sequence; sensitivity and specificity; upregulation; blood; epigenetics; gastrointestinal tumor; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; metabolism; methylation; molecular dynamics; tumor cell line; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Epigenomics; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Methylation; MicroRNAs; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization",2-s2.0-85071627062

Using a systematic review and meta-analysis approach, we aimed to investigate the effect of DAA therapy on sustained virologic response (SVR) among patients with CHC and either active, inactive or no HCC. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched from 1/1/2013 to 9/24/2018. The pooled SVR rates were computed using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models. Results: We included 49 studies from 15 countries, comprised of 3,341 patients with HCC and 35,701 without HCC. Overall, the pooled SVR was lower in patients with HCC than in those without HCC (89.6%, 95% CI 86.8–92.1%, I2 = 79.1% vs. 93.3%, 95% CI 91.9–94.7%, I2 = 95.0%, p = 0.0012), translating to a 4.8% (95% CI 0.2–7.4%) SVR reduction by meta-regression analysis. The largest SVR reduction (18.8%) occurred in patients with active/residual HCC vs. inactive/ablated HCC (SVR 73.1% vs. 92.6%, p = 0.002). Meanwhile, patients with HCC who received a prior liver transplant had higher SVR rates than those who did not (p &lt;0.001). Regarding specific DAA regimens, patients with HCC treated with ledipasvir/sofosbuvir had lower SVR rates than patients without HCC (92.6%, n = 884 vs. 97.8%, n = 13,141, p = 0.026), but heterogeneity was high (I2 = 84.7%, p &lt;0.001). The SVR rate was similar in patients with/without HCC who were treated with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir ± dasabuvir (n = 101) (97.2% vs. 94.8%, p = 0.79), or daclatasvir/asunaprevir (91.7% vs. 89.8%, p = 0.66). Conclusion: Overall, SVR rates were lower in patients with HCC, especially with active HCC, compared to those without HCC, though heterogeneity was high. Continued efforts are needed to aggressively screen, diagnose, and treat HCC to ensure higher CHC cure rates. Lay summary: There are now medications (direct-acting antivirals or “DAAs”) that can “cure” hepatitis C virus, but patients with hepatitis C and liver cancer may be less likely to achieve cure than those without liver cancer. However, patients with liver cancer are also more likely to have advanced liver disease and risk factors that can decrease cure rates, so better controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings. ? 2019 European Association for the Study of the Liver",Asian; HCC treatment; Liver transplant; Non-Asian; Real-world analysis,asunaprevir; daclatasvir; dasabuvir plus ombitasvir plus paritaprevir plus ritonavir; ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir; antiviral therapy; Article; cancer patient; chronic hepatitis C; Cochrane Library; Embase; human; liver cell carcinoma; Medline; meta analysis; priority journal; sustained virologic response; systematic review; Web of Science,2-s2.0-85067690668

However, the mechanisms responsible for the altered expression of miRNAs in malignant cells remain poorly understood. Herein, via epigenetic unmasking, we identified a group of miRNAs located in the imprinted delta like non-canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1)-maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) locus that were repressed in hepatic tumor cells. Notably, miR-493-5p epigenetic silencing was correlated with hypermethylation of the MEG3 differentially regulated region (DMR) in liver cancer cell lines and tumor tissues from patients. Experimental rescue of miR-493-5p promoted an anti-cancer response by hindering hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell growth in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. We found that miR-493-5p mediated part of its tumor-suppressor activity by abrogating overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and the IGF2-derived intronic oncomir miR-483-3p in HCC cells characterized by IGF2 loss of imprinting (LOI). In summary, this study describes an unknown miRNA-dependent regulatory mechanism between two distinct imprinted loci and a possible therapeutic window for liver cancer patients exhibiting IGF2-miR-483 LOI and amplification. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,microRNA; microRNA 493 5p; somatomedin B; unclassified drug; Article; cancer cell; cell growth; controlled study; delta like non canonical notch ligand 1 gene; epigenetics; gene locus; human; human cell; liver cancer; liver cancer cell line; liver tumor; maternally expressed 3 gene; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; tumor growth,2-s2.0-85069493583

Design: This was a prospective multicenter, double-masked, sham-controlled randomized clinical study across 62 centers. Methods: In this phase 3b/4 study, patients with PCV with best-corrected visual acuity of 73–24 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (20/40–20/320 Snellen equivalent) received IAI 2 mg every 4 weeks until week 12, when they were randomized 1:1 to receive IAI or IAI plus rPDT if rescue criteria were met. Patients not requiring rescue received IAI every 8 weeks; those requiring rescue received IAI every 4 weeks plus sham/active PDT. At week 52 (the primary endpoint), IAI was noninferior to IAI plus rPDT. After week 52, treatment intervals could be extended beyond 8 weeks at the investigators' discretion. Noninferiority of IAI vs IAI plus rPDT for mean best-corrected visual acuity change from baseline to week 96 was evaluated. Results: Over 96 weeks, 54 patients (17.0%) met rescue criteria. At week 96, IAI was noninferior to IAI plus rPDT in terms of Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters gained (+10.7 vs +9.1, P = .48). Proportions of patients with complete polyp regression (33.1% vs 29.1%) or without active polyps (82.1% vs 85.6%) were similar. In year 2, the mean number of injections was 4.6 in both arms. No new safety signals were observed. Conclusion: IAI monotherapy was noninferior to IAI with rescue PDT up to 96 weeks, and functional and anatomical improvements achieved at 52 weeks were maintained. Few patients required rescue PDT, which provided no additional visual benefit. ? 2019",,aflibercept; Article; best corrected visual acuity; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; clinical study; conjunctival hemorrhage; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug screening; dry eye; human; incidence; indocyanine green angiography; intraocular pressure; long term care; major clinical study; monotherapy; multicenter study; optical coherence tomography; phase 3 clinical trial; phase 4 clinical trial; photodynamic therapy; polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; retina hemorrhage; treatment duration; vitreous hemorrhage,2-s2.0-85065061902

In TGFb/Smad signaling, receptor-activated Smad complexes activate or repress their target gene promoters. Smad cofactors are a group of Smad-binding proteins that promote recruitment of Smad complexes to these promoters. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), which behave as Smad cofactors, have thus far not been identified. Here, we characterize a novel lncRNA EMT-associated lncRNA induced by TGFb1 (ELIT-1). ELIT-1 was induced by TGFb stimulation via the TGFb/Smad pathway in TGFb-responsive cell lines. ELIT-1 depletion abrogated TGFb-mediated EMT progression and expression of TGFb target genes including Snail, a transcription factor critical for EMT. A positive correlation between high expression of ELIT-1 and poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer suggests that ELIT-1 may be useful as a prognostic and therapeutic target. RIP assays revealed that ELIT-1 bound to Smad3, but not Smad2. In conjunction with Smad3, ELIT-1 enhanced Smad-responsive promoter activities by recruiting Smad3 to the promoters of its target genes including Snail, other TGFb target genes, and ELIT-1 itself. Collectively, these data show that ELIT-1 is a novel trans-acting lncRNA that forms a positive feedback loop to enhance TGFb/Smad3 signaling and promote EMT progression. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",,long untranslated RNA; RNA ELIT 1; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; transcription factor Snail; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; Article; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression; gene function; gene induction; gene targeting; human; human cell; luciferase assay; lung adenocarcinoma; microarray analysis; positive feedback; priority journal; promoter region; protein depletion; protein expression; protein RNA binding; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; signal transduction; stomach cancer,2-s2.0-85066506864

The present study aimed to determine the safety, feasibility, and effectiveness of RG for GC. Methods: This multi-institutional, single-arm prospective study, which included 330 patients from 15 institutions, was designed to compare morbidity rate of RG with that of a historical control (conventional laparoscopic gastrectomy, LG). This trial was approved for Advanced Medical Technology (“Senshiniryo”) B. The included patients were operable patients with cStage I/II GC. The primary endpoint was morbidity (Clavien–Dindo Grade ? IIIa). The specific hypothesis was that RG could reduce the morbidity rate to less than half of that with LG (6.4%). A sample size of 330 was considered sufficient (one-sided alpha 0.05, power 80%). Results: Among the 330 study patients, the protocol treatment was suspended in 4 patients. Thus, 326 patients fully enrolled and completed the study. The median patient age and BMI were 66?years and 22.4?kg/m 2 , respectively. Distal gastrectomy was performed in 253 (77.6%) patients. The median operative time and estimated blood loss were 313?min and 20?mL, respectively. No 30-day mortality was seen, and morbidity showed a significant reduction to 2.45% with RG (p = 0.0018). Conclusions: RG for cStage I/II GC is safe and feasible. It may be effective in reducing morbidity with LG. ? 2018, The International Gastric Cancer Association and The Japanese Gastric Cancer Association.",Gastrectomy; Minimally invasive surgical procedures; Postoperative complications; Robotic surgical procedure; Stomach neoplasms,"aged; Article; body mass; cancer staging; cancer surgery; comparative effectiveness; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; feasibility study; female; gastrectomy; human; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; morbidity; mortality rate; multicenter study; operation duration; operative blood loss; patient safety; priority journal; prospective study; robot assisted surgery; stomach cancer; adenocarcinoma; adult; clinical trial; devices; gastrectomy; middle aged; phase 2 clinical trial; postoperative complication; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; stomach tumor; very elderly; Adenocarcinoma; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Gastrectomy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Postoperative Complications; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Stomach Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85058035793

Despite the use of surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, many patients suffer from recurrence within 6?months, termed platinum resistance. Currently, the lack of relevant molecular biomarkers for the prediction of the early recurrence of serous ovarian cancers is linked to the poor prognosis. To identify an effective biomarker for early recurrence, we analyzed the genome-wide DNA methylation status characteristic of early recurrence after treatment. The patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset who showed a complete response after the first therapy were categorized into 2 groups: early recurrence serous ovarian cancer (ERS, recurrence??12?months, n?=?51) and late recurrence serous ovarian cancer (LRS, recurrence >12?months, n?=?158). Among the 12 differently methylated probes identified between the 2 groups, we found that ZNF671 was the most significantly methylated gene in the early recurrence group. A validation cohort of 78 serous ovarian cancers showed that patients with ZNF671 DNA methylation had a worse prognosis (P?<.05). The multivariate analysis revealed that the methylation status of ZNF671 was an independent factor for predicting the recurrence of serous ovarian cancer patients both in the TCGA dataset and our cohort (P?=.049 and P?=.021, respectively). Functional analysis revealed that the depletion of ZNF671 expression conferred a more migratory and invasive phenotype to the ovarian cancer cells. Our data indicate that ZNF671 functions as a tumor suppressor in ovarian cancer and that the DNA methylation status of ZNF671 might be an effective biomarker for the recurrence of serous ovarian cancer after platinum-based adjuvant chemotherapy. ? 2019 The Authors.

In the present study, four cyclohexanone curcumin analogs were synthesized. Additionally, their anticancer progression activity on CRPC cell lines, PC3 and PLS10 cells, was examined. We first determined their anti-metastasis properties and found that 2,6-bis-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-benzylidene)-cyclohexanone (2A) and 2,6-bis-(3,4-dihydroxy-benzylidene)-cyclohexanone (2F) showed higher anti-invasion properties against CRPC cells than curcumin. Analog 2A inhibited both MMP-2 and MMP-9 secretions and activities, whereas analog 2F reduced only MMP activities. These findings suggest that the compounds may inhibit CRPC cell metastasis by decreased extracellular matrix degradation. Analog 2A, the most potent analog, was then subjected to an in?vivo study. Similar to curcumin, analog 2A was detectable in the serum of mice at 30 and 60?minutes after i.p. injections. Analog 2A and curcumin (30?mg/kg bodyweight) showed a similar ability to reduce tumor area in lungs of mice that were i.v. injected with PLS10 cells. Additionally, analog 2A showed superior growth inhibitory effect on PLS10 cells than that of curcumin both in?vitro and in?vivo. The compound inhibited PLS10 cells growth by induction of G1 phase arrest and apoptosis in?vitro. Interestingly, analog 2A significantly decreased tumor growth with downregulation of cell proliferation and angiogenesis in PLS10-bearing mice. Taken together, we could summarize that analog 2A showed promising activities in inhibiting CRPC progression both in?vitro and in?vivo. ? 2018 The Authors.

We aimed to clarify the impact of cirrhosis on DAA treatment of patients infected with HCV. Methods: This large-scale, multicenter, retrospective study consisted of 2130 HCV genotype 1b-infected patients who were treated with one of the following DAA combination therapies: asunaprevir/daclatasvir (ASV/DCV), ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF), or paritaprevir/ombitasvir/ritonavir (PTV/OBV/r). Ninety-two patients (4.3%) previously received DAA-based treatment. Seven hundred and forty-five patients (34.9%) had cirrhosis. Results: Overall, the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate was 93.0%. The SVR rates in patients who received ASV/DCV, LDV/SOF, or PTV/OBV/r were 90.0%, 96.9%, and 97.6%, respectively. The SVR rate in patients with cirrhosis (89.1%) was significantly lower than that in patients without cirrhosis (95.1%, P = 6.94 × 10 –7 ). In the multivariate analysis for the overall cohort, absence of cirrhosis (P = 1.26 × 10 –3 ), no previous DAA-based treatment (P = 2.54 × 10 –14 ), low HCV-RNA levels (P = 1.64 × 10 –6 ), wild-type non-structural protein 5A L31/Y93 (P = 7.33 × 10 –13 ), and DAA regimen (LDV/SOF or PTV/OBV/r) (P = 1.92 × 10 –14 ) were independent factors contributing to SVR. Except for patients with DAA-based treatment history, absence of cirrhosis (P = 2.15 × 10 –3 ; odds ratio, 2.51) was an independent factor contributing to SVR in 2038 DAA-na?ve patients. Conclusion: This study suggests that the presence of cirrhosis reduces the SVR rate of DAA treatment, regardless of the type of DAA treatment. ? 2018 The Japan Society of Hepatology",cirrhosis; direct-acting antiviral; genotype 1; hepatitis C virus,aspartate aminotransferase; asunaprevir; bilirubin; daclatasvir; havoni; hyaluronic acid; ledipasvir; Mac 2 binding protein; ombitasvir; ombitasvir plus paritaprevir plus ritonavir; paritaprevir; peptides and proteins; ritonavir; sofosbuvir; sunvepra; unclassified drug; adult; aged; amino acid sequence; antiviral therapy; Article; compensated liver cirrhosis; female; follow up; genotype; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1b; human; liver fibrosis; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; retrospective study; sustained virologic response; treatment response,2-s2.0-85056415796

Methods: This post hoc analysis of a multicenter, retrospective study included patients who had received elbasvir/grazoprevir. CKD was defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;?60?mL/min/1.73?m 2 . The sustained virologic response (SVR) rate and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events were assessed in patients with CKD. Results: The study population comprised 155 men and 182 women. The median eGFR level at baseline was 69.6?mL/min/1.73?m 2 (range, 3.0–128.5?mL/min/1.73?m 2 ). Among the 337 patients, 109 (32.3%) had CKD: 72, 14, and 23 (including 20 hemodialysis) had CKD stages 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The SVR rates according to the baseline CKD stages were 98.1% (51/52) in stage 1, 98.3% (173/176) in stage 2, 93.9% (46/49) in stage 3a, 100% (23/23) in stage 3b, 100% (14/14) in stage 4, and 100% (23/23) in stage 5. All 20 patients undergoing hemodialysis achieved SVR. There was no significant decrease from baseline in the median eGFR level throughout the treatment period among the patients with CKD. The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was 6.4% (7/109) among the patients with CKD and 9.7% (22/228) among the patients without CKD (not significant, P?=?0.323). Conclusions: The present study demonstrated that elbasvir and grazoprevir are highly effective and safe for genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C Japanese patients with CKD, including those undergoing hemodialysis. ? 2018 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",chronic hepatitis C; chronic kidney disease; elbasvir; grazoprevir; hemodialysis,alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; asunaprevir; bilirubin; daclatasvir; elbasvir plus grazoprevir; erelsa; grazyna; ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin blood level; chronic hepatitis C; chronic kidney failure; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; hemodialysis; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1b; human; hyperkalemia; incidence; Japanese (people); liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; post hoc analysis; priority journal; retrospective study; side effect; sustained virologic response,2-s2.0-85053478676

In this Phase 3 study, we evaluated sofosbuvir–velpatasvir with or without ribavirin for 12?weeks in patients with any HCV genotype and decompensated cirrhosis [Child–Pugh–Turcotte (CPT) class B or C] in Japan. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive sofosbuvir–velpatasvir with or without ribavirin for 12?weeks. Randomization was stratified by CPT class and genotype. Sustained virologic response 12?weeks following completion of treatment (SVR12) was the primary efficacy endpoint. Results: Of the 102 patients enrolled, 57% were treatment naive, 78% and 20% had genotype 1 and 2 HCV infection, respectively, and 77% and 20% had CPT class B and C cirrhosis, respectively, at baseline. Overall, 61% of patients were female and the mean age was 66?years (range 41–83). SVR12 rates were 92% (47/51) in each group. Among patients who achieved SVR12, 26% had improved CPT class from baseline to posttreatment week 12. Most adverse events (AEs) were consistent with clinical sequelae of advanced liver disease or known toxicities of ribavirin. Four patients (8%) who received sofosbuvir–velpatasvir and seven (14%) who received sofosbuvir–velpatasvir plus ribavirin experienced a serious AE. The 3 deaths (bacterial sepsis, gastric varices hemorrhage, hepatocellular carcinoma) were attributed to liver disease progression. Conclusion: Sofosbuvir–velpatasvir for 12?weeks provides a highly effective and well-tolerated therapy for Japanese patients with HCV and decompensated cirrhosis. Ribavirin did not improve efficacy but increased toxicity. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Advanced liver disease; Decompensated cirrhosis; Direct-acting antivirals; Sofosbuvir; Velpatasvir,"bilirubin; hemoglobin; ribavirin; sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir; antivirus agent; carbamic acid derivative; fused heterocyclic rings; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; sofosbuvir-velpatasvir drug combination; adult; aged; anemia; antiviral therapy; Article; bilirubin blood level; bleeding; Child Pugh score; controlled study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; genotype; hemoglobin blood level; hepatitis C; human; hyperglycemia; Japan; Japanese (people); liver cell carcinoma; liver function; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; open study; platelet count; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rhinopharyngitis; sepsis; side effect; stomach varices; sustained virologic response; treatment duration; clinical trial; comparative study; drug combination; genetics; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; liver cirrhosis; middle aged; phase 3 clinical trial; treatment outcome; very elderly; virology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Carbamates; Drug Combinations; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings; Humans; Japan; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Ribavirin; Sofosbuvir; Sustained Virologic Response; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85053553827

Methods: Patients were prospectively enrolled in the primary analysis cohort if they had Stage III or IV epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer and were scheduled to receive paclitaxel plus carboplatin every 3?weeks in Cycles 1–6 and bevacizumab every 3?weeks in Cycles 2–22. Primary endpoints were bevacizumab-specific adverse events and adverse events ? Grade 3. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and the response rate. Results: Among 346 patients enrolled, 293 patients formed the primary analysis cohort. Regarding bevacizumab-specific adverse events ? grade 3, incidence rates of thromboembolic events (1.4%), gastrointestinal perforation (0.3%), fistula (0.7%), wound dehiscence (0%), and bleeding (0%) were very low. While incidence rates of hypertension (23.2%) and proteinuria (12.6%) were high, all such events were tolerable. No patient with prior bowel resection developed perforation or fistula. Median PFS was 16.3?months (95% CI 14.5–18.9). The response rate was 77.5% (95% CI 67.4–85.7). The response rate was 63.6% in patients with clear cell carcinoma, which tended to be better than previously reported. The median platinum-free interval was 11.5?months, and the platinum-resistant recurrence rate was 24.5%. Conclusions: Combining bevacizumab with chemotherapy was tolerable and efficacy was acceptable in Japanese patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab seems to reduce platinum-resistant recurrence and is promising for clear cell carcinoma. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Advanced epithelial ovarian cancer; Bevacizumab; First-line chemotherapy; Paclitaxel plus carboplatin; Platinum-free interval,"bevacizumab; carboplatin; paclitaxel; antineoplastic agent; bevacizumab; carboplatin; docetaxel; paclitaxel; adult; advanced cancer; aged; allergic reaction; anemia; Article; bleeding; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer survival; clear cell carcinoma; cohort analysis; digestive system perforation; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; endometrioid carcinoma; fatigue; febrile neutropenia; female; fistula; human; hypertension; intestine resection; Japanese (people); major clinical study; malaise; multiple cycle treatment; nausea; neutropenia; observational study; ovary cancer; ovary carcinoma; peripheral neuropathy; peritoneum cancer; primary tumor; priority journal; progression free survival; prospective study; proteinuria; recurrence risk; thrombocytopenia; thromboembolism; uterine tube carcinoma; venous thromboembolism; wound dehiscence; adenocarcinoma; colloid carcinoma; cystadenocarcinoma; endometrium tumor; Japan; middle aged; ovary tumor; pathology; prognosis; safety; survival rate; tumor recurrence; very elderly; young adult; Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell; Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Bevacizumab; Carboplatin; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous; Docetaxel; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Japan; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ovarian Neoplasms; Paclitaxel; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Safety; Survival Rate; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85050276379

Ixazomib is ideally suited for maintenance therapy given its convenient once-weekly oral dosing and low toxicity profile. In this study, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of ixazomib as maintenance therapy following ASCT. Methods: The phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled TOURMALINE-MM3 study took place in 167 clinical or hospital sites in 30 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and North and South America. Eligible participants were adults with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria who had achieved at least a partial response after undergoing standard-of-care induction therapy followed by high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m 2 ) conditioning and single ASCT within 12 months of diagnosis. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to oral ixazomib or matching placebo on days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles for 2 years following induction, high-dose therapy, and transplantation. The initial 3 mg dose was increased to 4 mg from cycle 5 if tolerated during cycles 1–4. Randomisation was stratified by induction regimen, pre-induction disease stage, and response post-transplantation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of ixazomib or placebo, according to treatment actually received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02181413, and follow-up is ongoing. Findings: Between July 31, 2014, and March 14, 2016, 656 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ixazomib maintenance therapy (n=395) or placebo (n=261). With a median follow-up of 31 months (IQR 27·3–35·7), we observed a 28% reduction in the risk of progression or death with ixazomib versus placebo (median PFS 26·5 months [95% CI 23·7–33·8] vs 21·3 months [18·0–24·7]; hazard ratio 0·72, 95% CI 0·58–0·89; p=0·0023). No increase in second malignancies was noted with ixazomib therapy (12 [3%] patients) compared with placebo (eight [3%] patients) at the time of this analysis. 108 (27%) of 394 patients in the ixazomib group and 51 (20%) of 259 patients in the placebo group experienced serious adverse events. During the treatment period, one patient died in the ixazomib group and none died in the placebo group. Interpretation: Ixazomib maintenance prolongs PFS and represents an additional option for post-transplant maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

TransNEOS, a translational study of New Primary Endocrine-therapy Origination Study (NEOS), evaluated whether Recurrence Score results can predict clinical response to neoadjuvant letrozole. Methods: NEOS is a phase 3 clinical trial of hormonal therapy ± adjuvant chemotherapy for postmenopausal patients with ER+, HER2-negative, clinically node-negative breast cancer, after six months of neoadjuvant letrozole and breast surgery. TransNEOS patients had tumors ? 2?cm and archived core-biopsy samples taken before neoadjuvant letrozole and subsequently sent for Recurrence Score testing. The primary endpoint was to evaluate clinical (complete or partial) response to neoadjuvant letrozole for RS < 18 versus RS ? 31. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of clinical response and rate of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) by continuous Recurrence Score result, ESR1 and PGR single-gene scores, and ER gene-group score. Results: Of 295 TransNEOS patients (median age 63?years; median tumor size 25?mm; 66% grade 1), 53.2% had RS < 18, 28.5% had RS18–30, and 18.3% had RS ? 31. Clinical response rates were 54% (RS < 18), 42% (RS18–30), and 22% (RS ? 31). A higher proportion of patients with RS < 18 had clinical responses (p < 0.001 vs. RS ? 31). In multivariable analyses, continuous Recurrence Score result (p < 0.001), ESR1 score (p = 0.049), PGR score (p < 0.001), and ER gene-group score (p < 0.001) were associated with clinical response. Recurrence Score group was significantly associated with rate of BCS after neoadjuvant treatment (RS < 18 vs. RS ? 31, p = 0.010). Conclusion: The Recurrence Score test is validated to predict clinical response to neoadjuvant letrozole in postmenopausal patients with ER+, HER2-negative, clinically node-negative breast cancer. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Breast cancer; Hormonal therapy; Neoadjuvant; Oncotype DX; Recurrence score,"estrogen receptor; estrogen receptor alpha; letrozole; progesterone receptor; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; estrogen receptor; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; breast surgery; cancer hormone therapy; cancer surgery; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug response; ER gene; ESR1 gene; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; female; genetic screening; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; partial mastectomy; PGR gene; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); postmenopause; predictive value; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment duration; treatment response; tumor volume; validation study; breast tumor; clinical trial; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; mastectomy; metabolism; middle aged; neoadjuvant therapy; pathology; phase 3 clinical trial; procedures; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; validation study; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Letrozole; Mastectomy; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85054130987

HBV DNA monitoring was undertaken monthly to 1 year after the last dose of study drug. In case of HBV reactivation (confirmed, HBV DNA ?29 IU/mL), immunochemotherapy was withheld and nucleos(t)ide analog treatment (preemptive NAT) started. Immunochemotherapy was restarted if HBV DNA became undetectable or reactivation was not confirmed, and discontinued if HBV DNA exceeded 100 IU/mL on NAT. Prophylactic NAT was allowed by investigator discretion. Among 326 patients with resolved HBV infection, 27 (8.2%) had HBV reactivation, occurring a median of 125 days (interquartile range, 85-331 days) after the first dose. In 232 patients without prophylactic NAT, 25 (10.8%) had HBV reactivation; all received preemptive NAT. Ninety-four patients received prophylactic NAT; 2 (2.1%) had HBV reactivation. No patients developed HBV-related hepatitis. On multivariate Cox analysis, detectable HBV DNA at baseline was strongly associated with an increased risk of reactivation (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 18.22; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.04-54.93; P < .0001). Prophylactic NAT was strongly associated with a reduced risk (adjusted HR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.02-0.41; P 5 .0018). HBV DNA monitoring–guided preemptive NAT was effective in preventing HBV-related hepatitis during anti–CD20-containing immunochemotherapy in B-cell NHL patients with resolved HBV infection. Antiviral prophylaxis was also effective and may be appropriate for high-risk patients.

We assessed the efficacy and toxicity of trastuzumab plus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced and/or recurrent or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive SDC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, single-arm, open-label, phase II study in Japan. The patients received trastuzumab at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Docetaxel 70 mg/m 2 was administrated every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the overall response rate; the secondary end points included the clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. This study is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (Identification No. UMIN000009437). RESULTS: Fifty-seven eligible patients with SDC were enrolled. The overall response rate was 70.2% (95% CI, 56.6% to 81.6%), and the clinical benefit rate was 84.2% (95% CI, 72.1% to 92.5%). Median progression-free and overall survival times were 8.9 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 9.9 months) and 39.7 months (95% CI, not reached), respectively. The most frequent adverse event was anemia (52 patients [91%]), followed by a decreased WBC count (51 patients [89%]) and neutropenia (50 patients [88%]).

However, the susceptibility of NTCP-expressing cells to HBV is diverse depending on the culture condition. Stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) was found to potentiate cell susceptibility to HBV infection. Here, we show that EGF receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in HBV virion internalization. In EGFR-knockdown cells, HBV or its preS1-specific fluorescence peptide attached to the cell surface, but its internalization was attenuated. PreS1 internalization and HBV infection could be rescued by complementation with functional EGFR. Interestingly, the HBV/preS1–NTCP complex at the cell surface was internalized concomitant with the endocytotic relocalization of EGFR. Molecular interaction between NTCP and EGFR was documented by immunoprecipitation assay. Upon dissociation from functional EGFR, NTCP no longer functioned to support viral infection, as demonstrated by either (i) the introduction of NTCP point mutation that disrupted its interaction with EGFR, (ii) the detrimental effect of decoy peptide interrupting the NTCP–EGFR interaction, or (iii) the pharmacological inactivation of EGFR. Together, these data support the crucial role of EGFR in mediating HBV–NTCP internalization into susceptible cells. EGFR thus provides a yet unidentified missing link from the cell-surface HBV–NTCP attachment to the viral invasion beyond the host cell membrane. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

However, the mechanisms by which genotype F1b causes HCC are unclear. Here, we analyzed the clinical and virological significance of genotype F1b in long-term serial samples from 20 HCC patients with HBV infection. Complete sequence analyses revealed that all isolates were genotype F1b. In the HCC patients, T1938C and A2051C mutations in the core region had accumulated significantly with A1762T/G1764A mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) region and G1896A mutation in the precore (PC) region. Several HBV clones containing the core mutations were examined for their replication efficiency and core stability in vitro. Clones containing the A2051C mutation replicated more efficiently than the wild type in association with enhanced stability of core protein dimerization. In chimeric mice with human hepatocytes carrying BCP/PC/2051 mutant but not with wild-type virus, liver fibrosis was induced in association with high levels of serum HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen. Interestingly, microarray analysis and validation study showed that five genes associated with cell proliferation or carcinogenesis, v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog, Grb2-associated binding protein 2, bradykinin receptor B2, follistatin, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8, were significantly up-regulated in human hepatocytes infected with genotype F1b, particularly the BCP/PC/2051 mutant, compared with other genotypes. Conclusion: We have identified an association between Alaska-specific core mutations and HCC development in AN people infected with genotype F1b; accumulation of these core mutations during the course of chronic infection with genotype F1b would contribute to HCC development in AN people earlier in life. ? 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,bradykinin B2 receptor; core protein; follistatin; GRB2 associated binding protein 2; hepatitis B surface antigen; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8; protein serine threonine kinase; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; Alaska Native; Article; cancer patient; cell proliferation; child; clinical article; dimerization; disease association; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype F1b; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; microarray analysis; molecular cloning; phylogeny; priority journal; promoter region; sequence analysis; virology; virus mutation; virus oncogene; virus replication,2-s2.0-85056996329

Aim: To investigate if hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) is an independent of surface antigen (HBsAg) for risk prediction of NA cessation. Methods: This prospective multicentre study enrolled 135 CHB patients who stopped entecavir or tenofovir after achieving viral remission for a median of 25.2?months. All patients stopped NA with negative HBeAg and undetectable viral DNA, and were then observed for clinical relapse and HBsAg loss. Predictors including HBsAg and HBcrAg levels were explored using Cox proportional hazard model and weighted to develop a risk score. Results: During a median follow-up of 25.9?months, clinical relapse and HBsAg loss occurred in 66 and eight patients, respectively, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 56.1% (95% CI 46.7-66.0%) and 8.8% (95% CI 4.3-17.4%), respectively. HBcrAg was an independent relapse predictor, as well as HBsAg, age, ALT and tenofovir use. A score (SCALE-B) was calculated by the equation of 35*HBsAg (log?IU/mL)?+?20*HBcrAg (log U/mL)?+?2*age (year)?+?ALT (U/L)?+?40 for tenofovir use. The concordance rates for clinical relapse were 0.87, 0.88, 0.87, 0.85 and 0.90 at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5?years, respectively. Moreover, HBsAg loss occurred exclusively in low-risk patients predicted by the score. Conclusions: Serum HBcrAg and HBsAg levels were independent predictors of off-NA relapse and can be factored into a risk score to guide treatment cessation in patients with CHB. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"alanine aminotransferase; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; nucleoside analog; tenofovir; virus DNA; antivirus agent; biological marker; entecavir; guanine; hepatitis B core antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; adult; Article; chronic hepatitis B; drug use; female; follow up; human; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; prospective study; relapse; remission; risk factor; blood; chronic hepatitis B; clinical trial; incidence; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; recurrent disease; treatment withdrawal; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers; DNA, Viral; Female; Guanine; Hepatitis B Core Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Tenofovir; Withholding Treatment",2-s2.0-85056697891

This LC-NE system plays a critical role in a variety of brain functions, including attention, arousal, emotion, cognition, and the sleep-wake cycle. The LC is one of the brain regions vulnerable to the occurrence of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), which is associated with “primary age-related tauopathy (PART)” that describes the pathology commonly observed in the brains of aged individuals. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the LC is one of the first places to develop NFTs, which may act as a seed for subsequent spreading of the pathology throughout the brain upon amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation. As AD progresses, significant neuron loss occurs in the LC. Moreover, LC neurodegeneration is not only a consequence of AD, but also drives clinical and pathological manifestations of AD, such as microglial dysregulation, sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and neurovascular dysfunction. Therefore, prevention of NFT pathology and neuron loss in the LC-NE system is critical for suppressing the progression of AD. We propose that targeting aging itself may be a proactive intervention against age-associated changes in the LC. Such an approach could open the way for novel interventions against age-associated neurodegenerative disorders, in particular, AD. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Aging; Alzheimer's disease; Hypothalamus; Locus coeruleus; mTOR signaling; Neurofibrillary tangles; Sirtuins; Sleep,noradrenalin; sirtuin; noradrenalin; tau protein; aging; Alzheimer disease; brain region; brain size; cell loss; cognitive defect; human; locus ceruleus; microglia; nerve cell; nerve degeneration; neurofibrillary tangle; neuropathology; neurovascular coupling; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; Review; sleep disorder; sleep waking cycle; tauopathy; aging; Alzheimer disease; brain; brain stem; disease exacerbation; locus ceruleus; metabolism; neurofibrillary tangle; pathology; physiology; tauopathy; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Brain Stem; Disease Progression; Humans; Locus Coeruleus; Nerve Degeneration; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Neurons; Norepinephrine; tau Proteins; Tauopathies,2-s2.0-85042379153

Methods We conducted a two-stage genomewide association study and candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) association study on leisure-time exercise behavior using 13,980 discovery samples from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) study, and 2036 replication samples from the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center-2 study. Leisure-time physical activity was measured using a self-administered questionnaire that inquired about the type, frequency and duration of exercise. Participants with ?4 MET·h·wk-1 of leisure-time physical activity were defined as exhibiting leisure-time exercise behavior. Association testing using mixed linear regression models was performed on the discovery and replication samples, after which the results were combined in a meta-analysis. In addition, we tested six candidate genetic variants derived from previous genomewide association study. Results We found that one novel SNP (rs10252228) located in the intergenic region between NPSR1 and DPY19L1 was significantly associated with leisure-time exercise behavior in discovery samples. This association was also significant in replication samples (combined P value by meta-analysis = 2.2 × 10-9). Several SNP linked with rs10252228 were significantly associated with gene expression of DPY19L1 and DP19L2P1 in skeletal muscle, heart, whole blood, and the nervous system. Among the candidate SNP, rs12612420 in DNAPTP6 demonstrated nominal significance in discovery samples but not in replication samples. Conclusions We identified a novel genetic variant associated with regular leisure-time exercise behavior. Further functional studies are required to validate the role of these variants in exercise behavior. ? 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.All Rights Reserved.",GENOTYPE; PHYSICAL ACTIVITY; SPORTS PARTICIPATION,"spacer DNA; adult; aged; cohort analysis; exercise; female; genetics; genome-wide association study; health behavior; human; Japan; leisure; male; middle aged; questionnaire; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; DNA, Intergenic; Exercise; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Health Behavior; Humans; Japan; Leisure Activities; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85056508663

These adult NSCs retain their self-renewal ability and capacity to differentiate into neurons and glia as demonstrated by in?vitro studies. However, their contribution to tissue repair in disease and injury is limited, lending credence to the claim by prominent neuropathologist Ram?n y Cajal that ‘once development was ended, the founts of growth and regeneration of the axons and dendrites dried up irrevocably’. However, recent progress toward understanding the fundamental biology of adult NSCs and their role in pathological conditions has provided new insight into the potential therapeutic utility of endogenous NSCs. In this short review, we highlight two topics: the altered behavior of NSCs?after brain damage and the dysfunction of NSCs and?oligodendrocyte precursor cells, another type of undifferentiated cell in the adult brain, in mood affective disorders.

Methods: The rate of sustained virologic response (SVR) and safety were analyzed in patients who started the EBR/GZR regimen between November 2016 and July 2017. SVR rates were compared based on patient baseline characteristics. Results: Overall, 371 of 381 patients (97.4%) achieved SVR. Multivariate analysis identified a history of failure to IFN-free DAA therapy and the presence of double resistance-associated substitutions (RASs) in HCV non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) as factors significantly associated with failure to EBR/GZR treatment. The SVR rates of patients with a history of IFN-free DAA therapy and those with double RASs were 55.6 and 63.6%, respectively. In all other subpopulations, the SVR rates were more than 90%. There were no severe adverse events associated with the treatment. Conclusions: The EBR/GZR regimen yielded high virological efficacy with acceptable safety. Patients with a history of failure to IFN-free DAA therapy or with double RASs in HCV-NS5A remained difficult to treat with this regimen. ? 2018, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Chronic hepatitis C; Efficacy; Elbasvir; Genotype 1; Grazoprevir; Real world; Safety,"alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; asunaprevir; bilirubin; creatinine; daclatasvir; elbasvir plus grazoprevir; ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir; 2-(pyrrolidin-2-yl)-5-(2-(4-(5-(pyrrolidin-2-yl)-1H-imidazol-2-yl)phenyl)benzofuran-5-yl)-1H-imidazole; antivirus agent; benzofuran derivative; imidazole derivative; MK-5172; quinoxaline derivative; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; bilirubin blood level; blood cell count; chronic hepatitis C; creatinine blood level; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; follow up; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; human; Japanese (people); kidney dysfunction; liver fibrosis; liver injury; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; outpatient care; platelet count; priority journal; sustained virologic response; treatment duration; treatment outcome; antiviral resistance; chronic hepatitis C; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; genetics; genotype; Hepacivirus; Japan; middle aged; multivariate analysis; retrospective study; sustained virologic response; very elderly; virology; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Benzofurans; Drug Resistance, Viral; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Imidazoles; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Quinoxalines; Retrospective Studies; Sustained Virologic Response",2-s2.0-85046627247

Here, we report that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase suppresses ciliogenesis by directly phosphorylating the deubiquitinase USP8 on Tyr-717 and Tyr-810 in RPE1 cells. These phosphorylations elevate the deubiquitinase activity, which then stabilizes the trichoplein-Aurora A pathway, an inhibitory mechanism of ciliogenesis. EGFR knockdown and serum starvation result in ciliogenesis through downregulation of the USP8-trichoplein-Aurora A signal. Moreover, primary cilia abrogation, which is induced upon IFT20 or Cep164 depletion, ameliorates the cell cycle arrest of EGFR knockdown cells. The present data reveal that the EGFR-USP8-trichoplein-Aurora A axis is a critical signaling cascade that restricts ciliogenesis in dividing cells, and functions to facilitate cell proliferation. We further show that usp8 knockout zebrafish develops ciliopathy-related phenotypes including cystic kidney, suggesting that USP8 is a regulator of ciliogenesis in vertebrates. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"aurora A kinase; carrier protein; Cep164 protein; deubiquitinase; epidermal growth factor receptor; ift20 protein; protein tyrosine kinase; trichoplein; tyrosine; ubiquitin specific protease 8; unclassified drug; AURKA protein, human; aurora A kinase; carrier protein; deubiquitinase; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; ESCRT protein; proteinase; TCHP protein, human; ubiquitin thiolesterase; USP8 protein, human; zebrafish protein; cell component; chemical reaction; enzyme; enzyme activity; growth; phenotype; protein; serum; starvation; vertebrate; animal experiment; Article; cell cycle arrest; cell division; cell function; cell proliferation; ciliogenesis; ciliopathy; cilium; controlled study; down regulation; hTERT-RPE1 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; nonhuman; primary cilium; protein degradation; protein depletion; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein stability; serum; signal transduction; starvation; zebra fish; animal; cell cycle checkpoint; cell line; chemistry; cilium; deficiency; disease model; gene knockout; genetics; metabolism; pathology; phosphorylation; protein degradation; retinal pigment epithelium; serum-free medium; transgenic animal; ultrastructure; Danio rerio; Vertebrata; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Aurora Kinase A; Carrier Proteins; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line; Cilia; Ciliopathies; Culture Media, Serum-Free; Deubiquitinating Enzymes; Disease Models, Animal; Endopeptidases; Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport; Gene Knockout Techniques; Humans; Phosphorylation; Proteolysis; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Signal Transduction; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase; Zebrafish; Zebrafish Proteins",2-s2.0-85042524540

Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have investigated genetic variants associated with coffee consumption in European populations, no such study has yet been conducted in an Asian population. Here, we conducted a GWAS to identify common genetic variations that affected coffee consumption in a Japanese population of 11,261 participants recruited as a part of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) study. Coffee consumption was collected using a self-administered questionnaire, and converted from categories to cups/day. In the discovery stage (n = 6,312), we found 2 independent loci (12q24.12-13 and 5q33.3) that met suggestive significance (P &lt; 1 × 10-6). In the replication stage (n = 4,949), the lead variant for the 12q24.12-13 locus (rs2074356) was significantly associated with habitual coffee consumption (P = 2.2 × 10-6), whereas the lead variant for the 5q33.3 locus (rs1957553) was not (P = 0.53). A meta-analysis of the discovery and replication populations, and the combined analysis using all subjects, revealed that rs2074356 achieved genome-wide significance (P = 2.2 × 10-16 for a meta-analysis). These findings indicate that the 12q24.12-13 locus is associated with coffee consumption among a Japanese population. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"adult; article; coffee; cohort analysis; DNA polymorphism; female; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; human; human experiment; Japan; Japanese (citizen); male; meta analysis; multicenter study (topic); questionnaire; Asian continental ancestry group; chromosome 12; coffee; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome-wide association study; middle aged; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 12; Coffee; Cohort Studies; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85041020117

Psychotherapy is a patient-preferred and promising strategy for treating depression among cancer patients. Several systematic reviews have investigated the effectiveness of psychological treatment for depression among cancer patients. However, the findings are conflicting, and no review has focused on depression among patients with incurable cancer. Objectives: To investigate the effects of psychotherapy for treating depression among patients with advanced cancer by conducting a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Pain, Palliative and Supportive Care Group Register, The Cochrane Controlled Trials Register, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases in September 2005. Selection criteria: All relevant RCTs comparing any kind of psychotherapy with conventional treatment for adult patients with advanced cancer were eligible for inclusion. Two independent review authors identified relevant studies. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently extracted data from the original reports using standardized data extraction forms. Two independent review authors also assessed the methodological quality of the selected studies according to the recommendations of a previous systematic review of psychological therapies for cancer patients that utilized ten internal validity indicators. The primary outcome was the standardized mean difference (SMD) of change between the baseline and immediate post-treatment scores. Main results: We identified a total of ten RCTs (total of 780 participants); data from six studies were used for meta-analyses (292 patients in the psychotherapy arm and 225 patients in the control arm). Among these six studies, four studies used supportive psychotherapy, one adopted cognitive behavioural therapy, and one adopted problem-solving therapy. When compared with treatment as usual, psychotherapy was associated with a significant decrease in depression score (SMD = -0.44, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.08 to -0.80). None of the studies focused on patients with clinically diagnosed depression. Authors' conclusions: Evidence from RCTs of moderate quality suggest that psychotherapy is useful for treating depressive states in advanced cancer patients. However, no evidence supports the effectiveness of psychotherapy for patients with clinically diagnosed depression. ? 2018 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,cancer patient; depression; human; priority journal; psychotherapy; Review; depression; meta analysis; neoplasm; psychology; randomized controlled trial (topic); Depression; Depressive Disorder; Humans; Neoplasms; Psychotherapy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,2-s2.0-84930218740

There is, however, no standard intervention for ameliorating FCR. Our clinical experience and previous studies have suggested the potential benefits of problem-solving therapy (PST) and behavioural activation (BA). Given the huge number of cancer survivors and limited number of therapists to competently conduct PST and BA, we have developed PST and BA smartphone applications. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of the smartphone-based PST (Kaiketsu-App) and BA (Genki-App) apps in reducing FCR in patients with breast cancer. Methods and analysis The SMartphone Intervention to LEssen fear of cancer recurrence project is an open-label, individually randomised, parallel-group trial. Allocation will be managed by a central server using a computer-generated random allocation sequence provided by an independent data centre. Participants will be randomised to smartphone-based intervention plus treatment as usual (TAU) or waitlist control with TAU alone. The primary endpoint of the study is the Japanese version of the Concerns About Recurrence Scale, which will be administered as an electronic patient-reported outcome on the patients' smartphone after 8 weeks.

However, their differential use has not been sufficiently investigated. In this study, a meta-analysis on differences in the efficacy for CDI between VCM and MNZ was performed. Reports of randomized controlled studies using VCM or MNZ to treat CDI were surveyed. Meta-analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method and random-effects model, and the risk ratio and 95% confidence interval were calculated. Excluding overlapping reports, 1043 reports were extracted and 5 randomized controlled studies were extracted. There was no difference in therapeutic effects for CDI between VCM and MNZ (RR = 1.08, 95% CI (0.99–1.17), p = 0.09, I2 = 37%). On subgroup analysis by the severity, there was no difference in the clinical effects for CDI between VCM and MNZ in non-severe cases (risk ratio: 1.09, 95% confidence interval: 1.00–1.19, p = 0.06), but the clinical effects of VCM were significantly higher than those of MNZ in severe cases (risk ratio: 1.19, 95% confidence interval: 1.02–1.39, p = 0.03).

Nucleos(t)ide analogue (NA) therapy effectively reduces the incidence of HCC, but it does not completely prevent the disease. Here, we show that dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) is involved in post-NA HCC development. We divided chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients who received NA therapy into two groups: 1) those who did not develop HCC during the follow-up period after NA therapy (no-HCC group) and 2) those who did (HCC group). miRNA expression profiles were significantly altered in CHB tissues as compared to normal liver, and the HCC group showed greater alteration than the no-HCC group. NA treatment restored the miRNA expression profiles to near-normal in the no-HCC group, but it was less effective in the HCC group. A number of miRNAs implicated in HCC, including miR-101, miR-140, miR-152, miR-199a-3p, and let-7g, were downregulated in CHB. Moreover, we identified CDK7 and TACC2 as novel target genes of miR-199a-3p. Our results suggest that altered miRNA expression in CHB contributes to HCC development, and that improvement of miRNA expression after NA treatment is associated with reduced HCC risk. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",CDK7; HBV; miR-199a-3p; Post-NA HCC; TACC2,"entecavir; microRNA; microRNA 101; microRNA 140; microRNA 146a; microRNA 148b; microRNA 152; microRNA 17; microRNA 199a 3p; microRNA 199a 5p; microRNA 374a; microRNA 376c; microRNA 660; microRNA 98; microRNA let 7g; unclassified drug; antivirus agent; carrier protein; cyclin dependent kinase; cyclin-dependent kinase-activating kinase; entecavir; guanine; microRNA; TACC2 protein, human; tumor suppressor protein; adult; Article; cancer risk; CDK7 gene; chronic hepatitis B; controlled study; down regulation; female; follow up; gene; gene expression profiling; Hepatitis B virus; human; human cell; human tissue; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; priority journal; TACC2 gene; aged; chronic hepatitis B; complication; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; middle aged; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Carrier Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclin-Dependent Kinases; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Guanine; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",2-s2.0-85050088253

Selective inhibitors of TYK2 may be effective in treating psoriasis. METHODS We conducted a phase 2, double-blind trial of a TYK2 inhibitor, BMS-986165, in adults with moderate-to-severe psoriasis, excluding patients with a previous lack of response to agents targeting cytokine signaling through the same tyrosine kinase pathway. Patients were randomly assigned to receive the drug orally at a dose of 3 mg every other day, 3 mg daily, 3 mg twice daily, 6 mg twice daily, or 12 mg daily or to receive placebo. The primary end point was a 75% or greater reduction from baseline in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score at week 12 (higher scores indicate greater severity of psoriasis). RESULTS A total of 267 patients received at least one dose in an intervention group of the trial. At week 12, the percentage of patients with a 75% or greater reduction in the PASI score was 7% (3 of 45 patients) with placebo, 9% (4 of 44 patients) with 3 mg of BMS-986165 every other day (P = 0.49 vs. placebo), 39% (17 of 44 patients) with 3 mg daily (P<0.001 vs. placebo), 69% (31 of 45 patients) with 3 mg twice daily (P<0.001 vs. placebo), 67% (30 of 45 patients) with 6 mg twice daily (P<0.001 vs. placebo), and 75% (33 of 44 patients) with 12 mg daily (P<0.001 vs. placebo). There were three serious adverse events in patients receiving the active drug, as well as one case of malignant melanoma 96 days after the start of treatment. CONCLUSIONS Selective inhibition of TYK2 with the oral agent BMS-986165 at doses of 3 mg daily and higher resulted in greater clearing of psoriasis than did placebo over a period of 12 weeks. Larger and longer-duration trials of this drug are required to determine its safety and durability of effect in patients with psoriasis.

However, there is an increasing understanding that the mechanisms are more complicated and that statin treatment, in particular when used as primary prevention, is of doubtful benefit. Areas covered: The authors of three large reviews recently published by statin advocates have attempted to validate the current dogma. This article delineates the serious errors in these three reviews as well as other obvious falsifications of the cholesterol hypothesis. Expert commentary: Our search for falsifications of the cholesterol hypothesis confirms that it is unable to satisfy any of the Bradford Hill criteria for causality and that the conclusions of the authors of the three reviews are based on misleading statistics, exclusion of unsuccessful trials and by ignoring numerous contradictory observations. ? 2018, ? 2018 The Author(s).

Recent advances in retinal imaging systems using optical coherence tomography technologies and pharmacological treatments using anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs and corticosteroids have revolutionized the clinical management of DR. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of DR are not fully determined, largely because hyperglycemic animal models only reproduce limited aspects of subclinical and early DR. Conversely, non-diabetic mouse models that represent the hallmark vascular disorders in DR, such as pericyte deficiency and retinal ischemia, have provided clues toward an understanding of the sequential events that are responsible for vision-impairing conditions. In this review, we summarize the clinical manifestations and treatment modalities of DR, discuss current and emerging concepts with regard to the pathophysiology of DR, and introduce perspectives on the development of new drugs, emphasizing the breakdown of the blood-retina barrier and retinal neovascularization.

As undifferentiated hiPSCs exhibit intrinsic tumorigenicity properties that enable them to form teratomas, hCTPs containing residual undifferentiated hiPSCs may cause tumor formation following transplantation. We first established quantitative and sensitive tumorigenicity testing of hiPSCs dissociated into single cells using NOD/Shi-scid IL2Rγnull (NOG) mice by inhibiting apoptosis of hiPSCs with a Rho kinase inhibitor. To examine different features in tumorigenicity of various hiPSCs, 10 commonly available hiPSC lines were subjected to in vivo tumorigenicity testing. Transplanted hiPSC lines showed remarkable variation in tumor incidence, formation latency, and volumes. Most of the tumors formed were classified as immature teratomas. However, no signs of malignancies, such as carcinoma and sarcoma, were recognized in the tumors. Characteristics associated tumorigenicity of hiPSCs were investigated with microarray analysis, karyotype analysis, and whole exome sequencing. Gene expression profiling and pathway analysis supported different features of hiPSC lines in tumorigenicity. hiPSC lines showed chromosomal abnormalities in some lines and 61±77 variants of cancer-related genes carrying effective nonsynonymous mutations, which were confirmed in the COSMIC databases. In this study, the chromosomal abnormalities and cancer-related gene mutations observed in hiPSC lines did not lead to the malignancy of tumors derived from hiPSCs. Our results suggest that the potential tumorigenicity risk of hCTPs containing residual undifferentiated hiPSCs is dependent on not only amounts of undifferentiated hiPSCs but also features of the cell lines used as raw materials, a finding that should be considered from the perspective of quality of hCTPs used. ? 2018 Yasuda et al.

Recent reports have demonstrated the risk of preterm birth following heavy metal exposure. Preterm births are classified as early and late, depending on the duration of pregnancy, and are associated with increased risk of congenital illnesses such as heart failure, asthma, etc. Particularly, early preterm births carry a higher risk of mortality; however, the differential effects of heavy metal exposure on early and late preterm births are unknown. Objectives: To analyze the association between maternal whole blood concentrations of heavy metals, such as cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), mercury (Hg), selenium (Se), and manganese (Mn) that are common toxicants in Japan, and early and late preterm births. Methods: The data of 14,847 pregnant women who were participants of the Japan Environment and Children's Study were used. Data of the self-questionnaire pertaining to the first trimester (T1), second/third trimester (T2), and medical records after delivery were analyzed. We divided preterm birth into two groups: early preterm (22 to < 34 weeks) and late preterm (34 to < 37 weeks). Maternal blood samples for measuring heavy metal concentrations were collected in T2 (pregnancy weeks: 14–39). The participants were classified into four quartiles (Q1–Q4) according to increasing heavy metal levels. Results: The rate of preterm birth was 4.5%. After controlling for confounding factors, such as age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, smoking, partner's smoking, drinking habits, gravidity, parity, number of cesarean deliveries, uterine infections, household income, educational levels, and sex of infant, Cd levels were found, by multivariable logistic regression analysis, to be significantly associated with early preterm birth (p = 0.002), with odds ratio for early preterm birth of 1.91 (95% confidence interval: 1.12–3.27, P = 0.018) in subjects of Q4 compared with in subjects with term birth (≧ 37 weeks). Conclusion: Maternal blood Cd levels during pregnancy are positively associated with the risk of early preterm birth among Japanese women. Identification of the main source of maternal Cd exposure may contribute to the prevention of early preterm births and health maintenance of mothers and their infants in the future. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Heavy metal concentrations; Pregnant women; Preterm births,"cadmium; heavy metal; lead; manganese; mercury; selenium; heavy metal; biochemical composition; blood; body mass; concentration (composition); health risk; heavy metal; pregnancy; womens health; adult; Article; cadmium blood level; female; heavy metal blood level; human; Japan; lead blood level; major clinical study; manganese blood level; maternal blood; mercury blood level; pregnant woman; premature labor; priority journal; selenium blood level; term birth; blood; gestational age; maternal exposure; newborn; pregnancy; prematurity; Japan; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Maternal Exposure; Metals, Heavy; Pregnancy; Premature Birth",2-s2.0-85049116971

Frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) associated with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) aggregation is characterized by progressive neuronal atrophy in frontal and temporal lobes of cerebral cortex. Furthermore, patients with FTLD display mental dysfunction in multiple behavioral dimensions. Nevertheless, their molecular origin for psychiatric symptoms remains unclear. Methods: In FTLD neurons and mouse models with TDP-43 aggregates, we examined coaggregation between TDP-43 and disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), a key player in the pathology of mental conditions and its effects on local translation in dendrites and psychiatric behaviors. The protein coaggregation and the expression level of synaptic proteins were also investigated with postmortem brains from patients with FTLD (n = 6). Results: We found cytosolic TDP-43/DISC1 coaggregates in brains of both FTLD mouse model and patients with FTLD. At the mechanistic levels, the TDP-43/DISC1 coaggregates disrupted the activity-dependent dendritic local translation through impairment of translation initiation and, in turn, reduced synaptic protein expression. Behavioral deficits detected in FTLD model mice were ameliorated by exogenous DISC1 expression. Conclusions: Our findings reveal a novel role of the aggregate-prone TDP-43/DISC1 protein complex in regulating local translation, which affects aberrant behaviors relevant to multiple psychiatric dimensions. ? 2018 Society of Biological Psychiatry",Coaggregation; DISC1; FTLD; Local translation; Psychiatric behaviors; TDP-43,"disks large homolog 4; disrupted in schizophrenia 1 protein; glutamate receptor 2; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; initiation factor 1; initiation factor 2alpha; initiation factor 4G; ionotropic receptor; metabotropic receptor 1; metabotropic receptor 5; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor; n methyl dextro aspartic acid receptor 2B; TAR DNA binding protein; tubulin; DISC1 protein, human; DNA binding protein; nerve protein; protein aggregate; TDP-43 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cytosol; dendrite; frontotemporal dementia; human; human tissue; mental function; mouse; nonhuman; polysome; priority journal; protein aggregation; protein binding; synapse; translation initiation; animal; animal behavior; brain; disease model; frontotemporal dementia; metabolism; pathophysiology; protein synthesis; proteinosis; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; DNA-Binding Proteins; Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration; Humans; Mice; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Protein Aggregates; Protein Aggregation, Pathological; Protein Biosynthesis",2-s2.0-85046754053

Yet, it crucially builds on the interpolation of RR interval series which has been generically performed with limited links to CHF pathophysiology. Objective: We devise a novel methodology estimating multifractal autonomic dynamics from heartbeat-derived series defined in the continuous time. We hypothesize that markers estimated from our novel framework are also effective for mortality prediction in severe CHF. Methods: We merge multifractal analysis within a methodological framework based on inhomogeneous point process models of heartbeat dynamics. Specifically, wavelet coefficients and wavelet leaders are computed over measures extracted from instantaneous statistics of probability density functions characterizing and predicting the time until the next heartbeat event occurs. The proposed approach is tested on data from 94 CHF patients aiming at predicting survivor and nonsurvivor individuals as determined after a four years follow up. Results and Discussion: Instantaneous markers of vagal and sympatho-vagal dynamics display power-law scaling for a large range of scales, from \simeq 0.5 to \simeq 100 s. Using standard support vector machine algorithms, the proposed inhomogeneous point-process representation-based multifractal analysis achieved the best CHF mortality prediction accuracy of 79.11% (sensitivity 90.48%, specificity 67.74%). Conclusion: Our results suggest that heartbeat scaling and multifractal properties in CHF patients are not generated at the sinus-node level, but rather by the intrinsic action of vagal short-term control and of sympatho-vagal fluctuations associated with circadian cardiovascular control especially within the very low frequency band. These markers might provide critical information in devising a clinical tool for individualized prediction of survivor and nonsurvivor CHF patients. ? 1964-2012 IEEE.",autonomic nervous system; congestive heart failure; heart rate variability; Multifractal analysis; point process; wavelet coefficients; wavelet leaders,"Cardiology; Continuous time systems; Dynamics; Forecasting; Heart; Interpolation; Outages; Probability density function; Standards; Support vector machines; Wavelet transforms; Autonomic nervous system; Congestive heart failures; Heart beats; Heart rate variability; Multifractal analysis; Nonhomogeneous media; Point process; Wavelet coefficients; Wavelet leader; Fractals; accuracy; aged; algorithm; Article; cardiovascular function; circadian rhythm; cohort analysis; conceptual framework; congestive heart failure; disease severity; dynamics; female; fractal analysis; heart beat; human; major clinical study; male; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; mortality; prediction; process model; sensitivity and specificity; support vector machine; survivor; theoretical model; wavelet analysis; electrocardiography; heart failure; heart rate; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; statistical model; wavelet analysis; Aged; Electrocardiography; Female; Fractals; Heart Failure; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Wavelet Analysis",2-s2.0-85041013694

However, the mechanism responsible for this outcome remains unknown. Here we investigated the effects of the SGLT2 inhibitor luseogliflozin on the development of renal fibrosis after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury in non-diabetic mice. Luseogliflozin significantly suppressed development of renal fibrosis, prevented peritubular capillary congestion/hemorrhage, attenuated CD31-positive cell loss, suppressed hypoxia, and increased vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A expression in the kidney after ischemia/reperfusion injury. Luseogliflozin failed to induce the above-mentioned protection in animals co-treated with sunitinib, a VEGF receptor inhibitor. Additionally, luseogliflozin reduced glucose uptake and increased VEGF-A expression in the kidneys of glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2)-downregulated mice following ischemia/reperfusion and in GLUT2-knock-down cells compared with those in normal controls. Withdrawal of glucose from cultured medium, to halt glucose uptake, remarkably increased VEGF-A expression and reversed the luseogliflozin-induced increase in VEGF-A expression in the proximal tubular cells. Thus, luseogliflozin prevented endothelial rarefaction and subsequent renal fibrosis after renal ischemia/reperfusion injury through a VEGF-dependent pathway induced by the dysfunction of proximal tubular glucose uptake in tubules with injury-induced GLUT2 downregulation. ? 2018 International Society of Nephrology",glucose uptake; renal fibrosis; sodium glucose co-transporter 2; vascular endothelial growth factor,"glucose; glucose transporter 2; luseogliflozin; sunitinib; vasculotropin A; 1,5-anhydro-1-(5-(4-ethoxybenzyl)-2-methoxy-4-methylphenyl)-1-thioglucitol; angiogenesis inhibitor; glucose transporter 2; Slc2a2 protein, mouse; Slc5a2 protein, mouse; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; sorbitol; sunitinib; vascular endothelial growth factor A, mouse; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; attenuation; controlled study; creatinine clearance; down regulation; drug determination; drug effect; glucose transport; kidney fibrosis; kidney injury; kidney ischemia; kidney proximal tubule; kidney tubule cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; protein glycosylation; renal capillary injury; reperfusion injury; signal transduction; acute kidney failure; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; C57BL mouse; capillary; complication; disease model; fibrosis; gene knockdown; genetics; glucose blood level; human; metabolism; pathology; pharmacology; preclinical study; treatment outcome; vascularization; Acute Kidney Injury; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Blood Glucose; Capillaries; Disease Models, Animal; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Fibrosis; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Glucose Transporter Type 2; Humans; Kidney Tubules, Proximal; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; Reperfusion Injury; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 2 Inhibitors; Sorbitol; Sunitinib; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",2-s2.0-85051371074

Tiotropium may modulate cough reflex sensitivity of acute viral cough, but its efficacy in asthmatic cough remains unknown. Objective: To evaluate whether tiotropium improves cough and cough reflex sensitivity in patients with asthma refractory to ICS/LABA. Methods: Seventeen consecutive patients with asthma with chronic cough despite the use of ICS/LABA (13 women; 43.4 ± 19.0 years; average ICS dose, 651 ± 189 μg/d; fluticasone equivalent) were additionally treated with tiotropium (5 μg/d) for 4 to 8 weeks to examine its effects on pulmonary function and capsaicin cough reflex sensitivity (cough thresholds C2 and C5). Cough severity, cough-specific quality of life, and asthma control were also evaluated using cough visual analog scales (VASs), the Japanese version of Leicester Cough Questionnaire (J-LCQ), and Asthma Control Test (ACT), respectively. Patients with an improved cough VAS score of 15 mm or more were considered responders to tiotropium. Results: Tiotropium significantly improved cough VAS, J-LCQ, and ACT scores, but not FEV1. Changes in cough VAS score correlated with those in C2 (r = ?0.58; P =.03), C5 (r = ?0.58; P =.03), and ACT scores (r = ?0.62; P =.02), but not in FEV1 in the overall patients. When analyses were confined to the 11 responders, tiotropium significantly improved capsaicin cough reflex sensitivity within the subgroup (C2: P =.01 and C5: P =.02) and versus the nonresponders (C2: P =.004 and C5: P =.02).

Many recent studies have indicated the beneficial effects of low doses of radiation, whereas some studies have suggested harmful effects even at low doses. This review article introduces various studies reporting both the beneficial and harmful effects of low-dose radiation, with a critique on the extent to which respective studies are reliable. Epidemiological studies are inherently associated with large biases, and it should be evaluated whether the observed differences are due to radiation or other confounding factors. On the other hand, well-controlled laboratory studies may be more appropriate to evaluate the effects of low-dose radiation. Since the number of such laboratory studies is steadily increasing, it will be concluded in the near future whether low-dose radiation is harmful or beneficial and whether the linear-no-threshold (LNT) theory is appropriate. Many recent biological studies have suggested the induction of biopositive responses such as increases in immunity and antioxidants by low-dose radiation. Based on recent as well as classical studies, the LNT theory may be out of date, and low-dose radiation may have beneficial effects depending on the conditions; otherwise, it may have no effects. ? 2018 by the authors.

Determining the mechanisms underlying insulin signaling dysfunction and resistance in AD will be important for its treatment. Impaired clearance of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) significantly contributes to amyloid accumulation, which is typically observed in the brain of AD patients. Reduced expression of important Aβ-degrading enzymes in the brain, such as neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), can promote Aβ deposition in sporadic late-onset AD patients. Here, we investigated whether insulin regulates the degradation of Aβ by inducing expression of NEP and IDE in cultured astrocytes. Treatment of astrocytes with insulin significantly reduced cellular NEP levels, but increased IDE expression. The effects of insulin on the expression of NEP and IDE involved activation of an extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-mediated pathway. The reduction in cellular NEP levels was associated with NEP secretion into the culture medium, whereas IDE was increased in the cell membranes. Moreover, insulin-treated astrocytes significantly facilitated the degradation of exogenous Aβ within the culture medium. Interestingly, pretreatment of astrocytes with an ERK inhibitor prior to insulin exposure markedly inhibited insulin-induced degradation of Aβ. These results suggest that insulin exposure enhanced Aβ degradation via an increase in NEP secretion and IDE expression in astrocytes, via activation of the ERK-mediated pathway. The inhibition of insulin signaling pathways delayed Aβ degradation by attenuating alterations in NEP and IDE levels and competition with insulin and Aβ. Our results provide further insight into the pathological relevance of insulin resistance in AD development. ? 2018 IBRO",Alzheimer's disease (AD); amyloid-β (Aβ); insulin; insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE); neprilysin (NEP),"amyloid beta protein; insulin; insulinase; lactate dehydrogenase; membrane metalloendopeptidase; mitogen activated protein kinase; amyloid beta protein; insulin; insulinase; membrane metalloendopeptidase; Alzheimer disease; animal cell; Article; astrocyte; cell culture; cell membrane; controlled study; disease course; enzyme activation; human; human tissue; insulin resistance; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein analysis; protein degradation; protein expression; protein function; protein secretion; rat; release assay; signal transduction; Western blotting; animal; astrocyte; drug effect; gene expression regulation; metabolism; phosphorylation; physiology; signal transduction; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Astrocytes; Cells, Cultured; Gene Expression Regulation; Insulin; Insulysin; Neprilysin; Phosphorylation; Rats; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85049355295

Here, we document a significant inverse correlation between the function of HTLV-1 Tax-specific CTL (Tax-CTL), as assessed by ex?vivo cytokine production in response to cognate peptide, and the HTLV-1 provirus load in PBMC in both HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers (AC) (Spearman rank correlation coefficient [Rs]?=??0.494, P?=.037, n?=?18) and ATL patients (Rs?=??0.774, P?=.001, n?=?15). There was also a significant correlation between the HTLV-1 provirus load and the percentage of PD-1-positive Tax-CTL in both HTLV-1 AC (Rs?=?0.574, P?=.013) and ATL patients (Rs?=?0.676, P?=.006). Furthermore, the percentage of PD-1-positive Tax-CTL was inversely correlated with their function in HTLV-1 AC (Rs?=??0.542, P?=.020), and ATL patients (Rs?=??0.639, P?=.010). These findings indicate that the function of Tax-CTL decreased as their programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) levels increased, parallel to the increased HTLV-1 provirus load in PBMC. We propose that functional Tax-CTL are crucial for determining the HTLV-1 provirus load in PBMC, not only in HTLV-1 AC, but also in ATL, and that PD-1 expression levels are reliable markers of Tax-CTL function. Thus, modulating the immunological equilibrium between Tax-CTL and HTLV-1-infected cells to achieve dominance of functional effectors could represent an ideal strategy for controlling HTLV-1-associated disease. ? 2018 The Authors.

Published data on the association between the miRNA SNPs and prostate cancer (PCa) risk are somewhat inconclusive. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of all available studies including 2,227 patients and 2,331 control subjects to evaluate the impact of three common genetic variants of microRNAs in prostate cancer risk. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were utilized to investigate the strength of the association. Results: For miR-499 polymorphism, a significant association was observed between the rs3746444 A>G polymorphism and PCa risk in heterozygote comparison and dominant genetic model, in particular in Asian population subgroup. For miR-146a polymorphism, the rs2910164 CC genotype was associated with decreased PCa risk in Asian population in homozygote comparison. In addition, rs2910164 CC genotype had a weekly higher percentage value in subgroup of Gleason score < 7.

For miR-196a2 polymorphism, no association was observed between this variant and PCa risk in the overall group. However, in stratified analysis by ethnicity, we found that rs11614913 T allele was a risk factor for Asian PCa patients. Conclusions: Polymorphisms of miR-196a2 rs11614913, miR-146a rs2910164, and miR-499 rs3746444 may contribute to the risk for developing prostate cancer in Asian descendants. Moreover, miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism was related to PCa prognosis. ? 2018 The Author(s). Published by S.

However, the extent to which the performance of specific metabolic profiling facilitates reliable estimations of the concentrations of the different pCSF biomarkers and their ratios remains unclear. The interpretation of the lower levels of molecules of metabolic profiling and their concentration ratios in pCSF related to brain disorders could facilitate an unchallenging detection of peripheral biomarkers of AD stages and other dementia types. In this study, we proposed the use of widely targeted metabolomics for pCSF metabolic profiling using 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate- (FMOC) derivatized ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) to evaluate the diversity of 97 amine-mediated metabolic patterns and pathways from confirmed diagnosis based on AD brain pathology. Our results identified the metabolites that contributed toward and mutually influenced the principal component analysis plot with integrated analytes. Furthermore, the AD group showed a significant variation in several analyte concentration levels compared to those of control subjects. These trends of the concentration levels expressed by the amine metabolic pathways indicated the decreased activity of polyamine and tryptophan-kynurenine (Trp-Kyn) metabolisms. Moreover, increased metabolites such as methionine sulfoxide, 3-methoxy-anthranilate, cadaverine, guanine, and histamine were observed by widely targeted metabolomics of pCSF from the AD subjects. According to their metabolic pathway analysis using FMOC-derivatized UHPLC-MS/MS assay, we supposed that the involvement of polyamine and Trp-Kyn metabolisms was observed in the pCSF samples. ? 2018",9-Fluorenylmethyl chloroformate; Alzheimer's disease; Cerebrospinal fluid; Ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry; Widely targeted metabolomics,"Amino acids; Biomarkers; Brain; Diagnosis; High performance liquid chromatography; High pressure liquid chromatography; Liquids; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Metabolites; Neurodegenerative diseases; Principal component analysis; 9-fluorenylmethyl chloroformate; Alzheimer's disease; Analyte concentration; Concentration levels; Metabolic pathway analysis; Metabolomics; Methionine sulfoxide; Ultra-high performance liquid chromatographies; Cerebrospinal fluid; 9 fluorenylmethyl chloroformate; amine; anthranilic acid; biological marker; cadaverine; guanine; histamine; kynurenine; methionine sulfoxide; polyamine; reagent; tryptophan; 1-(9-fluorenyl)methyl chloroformate; fluorene derivative; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; autopsy; blood level; brain disease; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical article; controlled study; dementia; derivatization; female; human; human tissue; male; metabolite; metabolomics; plasma; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; senile plaque; tandem mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; very elderly; widely targeted metabolomics; Alzheimer disease; cerebrospinal fluid; chemistry; high performance liquid chromatography; metabolism; metabolome; metabolomics; physiology; procedures; tandem mass spectrometry; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Biomarkers; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Female; Fluorenes; Humans; Male; Metabolome; Metabolomics; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",2-s2.0-85047610477

Therefore, thiamine deficiency (TD) can occur in any condition of unbalanced nutrition. If TD is left untreated, it causes the neuropsychiatric disorder Wernicke encephalopathy (WE). Although WE is a medical emergency, it is sometimes overlooked because most patients with WE do not exhibit all of the typical symptoms, including delirium, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia. If all of the typical clinical symptoms of WE are absent, diagnosis of TD or WE becomes more difficult.Method From a series of cancer patients, we reported three patients who developed TD without the typical clinical symptoms of WE.Result A 69-year-old woman with pancreatic body cancer receiving chemotherapy with paclitaxel and gemcitabine for six months. Her performance status (PS) was 1. A detailed interview revealed that she had appetite loss for six months. Another 69-year-old woman with ovarian cancer received nedaplatin; her PS was 0. A detailed interview revealed that she had appetite loss for three months. A 67-year-old woman with colon cancer receiving ramucirumab in combination with second-line fluorouracil with folinic acid and irinotecan. Her PS was 1. A detailed interview revealed that she had appetite loss for three weeks. None exhibited typical clinical signs of WE, but they developed appetite loss for six months, three months, and three weeks, respectively. The diagnosis of TD was supported by abnormally low serum thiamine levels.Significance of the results This report emphasizes the possibility of TD in cancer patients even when patients do not develop typical clinical signs of WE. The presence of appetite loss for more than two weeks may aid in diagnosing TD. Patients receiving chemotherapy may be at greater risk for developing TD. Copyright ?

Methods: Thirty-one patients with in-field local relapse of NSCLC (n = 23) or lung metastasis (n = 8) underwent repeat SBRT. All patients had grade 2 or lower radiation pneumonitis after the first SBRT. Local recurrence was diagnosed with CT and FDG-PET in 17 patients and by biopsy in 14. The median interval between the first and second SBRT was 18 months (range, 4-80). The first SBRT dose was mainly 48-52 Gy in 4 fractions (n = 25) according to the institutional protocols. Second SBRT doses were determined based on the tumor size and distance to organs at risk, and were mostly 48-52 Gy in 4 fractions (n = 13) or 60 Gy in 8 fractions (n = 13). Results: At 3 years, overall survival and local control rates were 36 and 53%, respectively, for all 31 patients. Four patients showed no further recurrence for > 5 years (63-111 months) after the second SBRT. Radiation pneumonitis after the second SBRT was grade 2 in 4 patients, and no grade 3 pneumonitis was observed. Conclusion: Repeat SBRT was safe. Local control and survival rates were higher than expected. SBRT should be an important treatment option for local recurrence of NSCLC or lung metastasis after previous local SBRT. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Local recurrence; Lung; Metastasis; Retreatment; SBRT; Stereotactic radiotherapy,"carcinoembryonic antigen; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; adult; aged; Article; cancer recurrence; clinical article; colon cancer; computer assisted tomography; female; human; lung metastasis; male; non small cell lung cancer; organs at risk; overall survival; positron emission tomography; progression free survival; radiation dose distribution; radiation pneumonia; retrospective study; stereotactic body radiation therapy; survival rate; tumor volume; cancer staging; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; procedures; radiation pneumonia; radiosurgery; re-irradiation; secondary; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Dose Fractionation, Radiation; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Radiation Pneumonitis; Radiosurgery; Re-Irradiation; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85050684990

Here we have applied random non-standard peptide integrated discovery (RaPID) screening to identify small macrocyclic peptide inhibitors of HBV entry that target the cell-surface receptor for HBV, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). In addition to their anti-HBV activity, these molecules also inhibit cellular entry by the related hepatitis D virus (HDV), and are active against diverse strains of HBV (including clinically relevant nucleos(t)ide analog-resistant and vaccine escaping strains). Importantly, these macrocyclic peptides, in contrast to other NTCP-binding HBV entry inhibitors, exhibited no inhibition of NTCP-mediated bile acid uptake, making them appealing candidates for therapeutic development. Hepatitis B virus infection causes serious illness and current treatments are not curative.

Exosomes from adipose-derived stem cells (hASCs) containing the long noncoding RNA MALAT1 are a novel, cell-free regenerative approach to long-term recovery after traumatic brain injury (TBI) that have the potential to modulate inflammation at the genomic level. The long noncoding RNA MALAT1 has been shown to be an important component of the secretome of hASCs. Methods: We isolated exosomes from hASC containing or depleted of MALAT1. The hASC-derived exosomes were then administered intravenously to rats following a mild controlled cortical impact (CCI). We followed the rats with behavior, in vivo imaging, histology, and RNA sequencing (RNA Seq). Results: Using in vivo imaging, we show that exosomes migrate into the spleen within 1 h following administration and enter the brain several hours later following TBI. Significant recovery of function on motor behavior as well as a reduction in cortical brain injury was observed after TBI in rats treated with exosomes. Treatment with either exosomes depleted of MALAT1 or conditioned media depleted of exosomes showed limited regenerative effects, demonstrating the importance of MALAT1 in exosome-mediated recovery. Analysis of the brain and spleen transcriptome using RNA Seq showed MALAT1-dependent modulation of inflammation-related pathways, cell cycle, cell death, and regenerative molecular pathways. Importantly, our data demonstrates that MALAT1 regulates expression of other noncoding RNAs including snoRNAs. Conclusion: We demonstrate that MALAT1 in hASC-derived exosomes modulates multiple therapeutic targets, including inflammation, and has tremendous therapeutic potential for treatment of TBI. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"long untranslated RNA; MALAT1; small nucleolar RNA; transcriptome; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; green fluorescent protein; long untranslated RNA; adipose derived stem cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain cell; cell cycle; cell death; cell isolation; cell migration; cohort analysis; controlled study; convalescence; exosome; gene control; gene expression; histology; human; human cell; in vivo study; inflammation; locomotion; male; nerve regeneration; nonhuman; rat; RNA sequence; spleen; traumatic brain injury; animal; body equilibrium; brain; cluster analysis; complication; disease model; drug effect; encephalitis; exosome; Fischer 344 rat; forelimb; genetics; metabolism; motor dysfunction; muscle strength; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; regeneration; time factor; traumatic brain injury; Animals; Brain; Brain Injuries, Traumatic; Cluster Analysis; Disease Models, Animal; Encephalitis; Exosomes; Forelimb; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Male; Motor Disorders; Muscle Strength; Postural Balance; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Regeneration; RNA, Long Noncoding; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85050012711

When patients do not achieve remission within several weeks, recommendations include adding or switching to another antidepressant. However, the relative merits of these guideline strategies remain unestablished. Methods: This multi-centre, open-label, assessor-blinded, pragmatic trial involved two steps. Step 1 used open-cluster randomisation, allocating clinics into those titrating sertraline up to 50 mg/day or 100 mg/day by week 3. Step 2 used central randomisation to allocate patients who did not remit after 3 weeks of treatment to continue sertraline, to add mirtazapine or to switch to mirtazapine. The primary outcome was depression severity measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) (scores between 0 and 27; higher scores, greater depression) at week 9. We applied mixed-model repeated-measures analysis adjusted for key baseline covariates. Results: Between December 2010 and March 2015, we recruited 2011 participants with hitherto untreated major depression at 48 clinics in Japan. In step 1, 970 participants were allocated to the 50 mg/day and 1041 to the 100 mg/day arms; 1927 (95.8%) provided primary outcomes. There was no statistically significant difference in the adjusted PHQ-9 score at week 9 between the 50 mg/day arm and the 100 mg/day arm (0.25 point, 95% confidence interval (CI), - 0.58 to 1.07, P = 0.55). Other outcomes proved similar in the two groups. In step 2, 1646 participants not remitted by week 3 were randomised to continue sertraline (n = 551), to add mirtazapine (n = 537) or to switch to mirtazapine (n = 558): 1613 (98.0%) provided primary outcomes. At week 9, adding mirtazapine achieved a reduction in PHQ-9 scores of 0.99 point (0.43 to 1.55, P = 0.0012); switching achieved a reduction of 1.01 points (0.46 to 1.56, P = 0.0012), both relative to continuing sertraline. Combination increased the percentage of remission by 12.4% (6.1 to 19.0%) and switching by 8.4% (2.5 to 14.8%). There were no differences in adverse effects. Conclusions: In patients with new onset depression, we found no advantage of titrating sertraline to 100 mg vs 50 mg. Patients unremitted by week 3 gained a small benefit in reduction of depressive symptoms at week 9 by switching sertraline to mirtazapine or by adding mirtazapine. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Antidepressive agents: first-line treatment; Major depressive disorder; Randomised controlled trial; Second-line treatment,"mirtazapine; sertraline; antidepressant agent; adult; Article; controlled study; disease severity; dose response; drug dose titration; drug effect; drug efficacy; female; follow up; human; Japan; major depression; male; multicenter study; open study; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; randomized controlled trial; remission; treatment outcome; trend study; aged; clinical trial; major depression; middle aged; Adult; Aged; Antidepressive Agents; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85050031068

Liver tumorigenesis is characterized by an accumulation of epigenetic abnormalities, leading to gene extinction and loss of hepatocyte differentiation. The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of converting liver cancer cells toward a less aggressive and differentiated phenotype using a process called epigenetic reconditioning. Here, we showed that an epigenetic regimen with non-cytotoxic doses of the demethylating compound 5-azacytidine (5-AZA) promoted an anti-cancer response by inhibiting HCC cell tumorigenicity. Furthermore, epigenetic reconditioning improved sorafenib response. Remarkably, epigenetic treatment was associated with a significant restoration of differentiation, as attested by the increased expression of characteristic hepatocyte markers in reconditioned cells. In particular, we showed that reexpression of these epigenetically silenced liver genes following 5-AZA treatment or after knockdown of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) was the result of regional CpG demethylation. Lastly, we confirmed the efficacy of HCC differentiation therapy by epigenetic reconditioning using an in vivo tumor growth model. In summary, this work demonstrates that epigenetic reconditioning using the demethylating compound 5-AZA shows therapeutic significance for liver cancer and is potentially attractive for the treatment of solid tumors. Curative management of primary liver cancer is limited given its resistance to chemotherapies. In this issue of Molecular Therapy, Gailhouste and colleagues show that demethylating agent-based treatments have anti-cancer effects on hepatic tumor cells, which supports the development of alternative epigenetic differentiation therapies to attenuate the aggressiveness and drug resistance of solid tumors. ? 2018 The Authors",5-azacytidine; DNA methylation; drug resistance; epigenetic reconditioning; hepatic differentiation; hepatocellular carcinoma; tumor growth,"azacitidine; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; sorafenib; azacitidine; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; carcinogenicity; cell differentiation; controlled study; CpG island; cytotoxicity; demethylation; epigenetics; female; Hep-G2 cell line; Hep3B cell line; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; human; human cell; in vivo study; limit of quantitation; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; mouse; nonhuman; protein targeting; tumor growth; animal; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; DNA methylation; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; liver; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; nude mouse; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Azacitidine; Carcinogenesis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatocytes; Humans; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Mice; Mice, Nude",2-s2.0-85046808743

Inclusion criteria were an onset age ?16 years; PM/DM or clinically amyopathic DM according to the published criteria; imaging evidence of ILD; and availability of serum samples for assays of autoantibodies such as anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 and anti-aminoacyl tRNA synthetase. We collected demographic data and clinical characteristics recorded at the time of diagnosis, as well as follow-up survival data. Predictors of ILD-related mortality were identified by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results. JAMI enrolled a cohort of 497 patients with PM (15%), classic DM (32%) and clinically amyopathic DM (53%). During the observation period (median 20 months), 76 died of respiratory insufficiency directly related to ILD. Univariate analysis revealed several initial parameters associated with ILD mortality, including demographic, clinical, laboratory, imaging and autoantibody variables. We used multivariate analysis with a stepwise selection of parameters to generate an appropriate predictive model, and identified the following independent risk factors for ILD mortality: age at onset ?60 years [hazard ratio (HR) = 4.3, 95% CI: 2.4, 7.5], CRP ?1 mg/dl (HR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.5, 4.8), peripheral capillary oxygen saturation <95% (HR = 2.0, 95% CI: 1.2, 3.4) and anti-melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 antibody (HR = 7.5, 95% CI: 2.8, 20.2). Conclusion. We established a large cohort of incident cases of PM/DM-associated ILD, and successfully identified independent predictors of short-term ILD mortality. ? The Author(s) 2018.

Methods: We used odds ratios (ORs) with corresponding 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) to evaluate the correlation between MTR A2756G polymorphism and risk of PCa in meta-analysis. Serum expression of MTR was detected by ELISA and in-silico tools were utilized to assess this variant. Results: Our study included 2,921 PCa patients and 3,095 control subjects. The results indicated that the MTR A2756G polymorphism is linked with an increased risk of PCa using three genetic models (G-allele vs. A-allele: OR = 1.16, 95%CI = 1.04 - 1.30; GA vs. AA: OR = 1.17, 95%CI = 1.02 - 1.33; GG+GA vs. AA: OR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.04 - 1.34). Stratified analysis produced similar results. A significant association was also indicated in advanced PCa from the meta-analysis. Finally, our experiments showed evidence that serum MTR levels in PCa patients with AA genotypes were statistically higher than in those with GG/GA genotypes. Conclusions: Our present study suggests that the MTR A2756G polymorphism may contribute to the risk of developing PCa, particularly in Asian and hospital-based studies. Moreover, serum MTR might be utilized in diagnosis of PCa. ?

OBJECTIVE To evaluate intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) in participants with PCV and compare IAI monotherapy with IAI plus rescue photodynamic therapy (PDT). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This 96-week, double-masked, sham-controlled phase 3b/4 randomized clinical trial was conducted at multiple centers in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan from May 2014 to August 2016, and included adults 50 years or older with symptomatic macular PCV and a best-corrected visual acuity of 73 to 24 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters (20/40-20/320 Snellen equivalent). INTERVENTIONS Participants received 2mg of IAI at weeks 0, 4, and 8. At week 12, participants with a suboptimal response were randomized 1:1 to receive IAI plus sham PDT (IAI monotherapy) or a ""rescue"" of IAI plus rescue PDT (IAI/PDT). Participants who did not qualify for rescue received IAI every 8 weeks; those qualifying for rescue received IAI every 4 weeks plus sham/active PDT. When the rescue criteria were no longer met, injection intervals were gradually extended to 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Noninferiority of IAI monotherapy to IAI/PDT for mean change in best-corrected visual acuity from baseline to week 52 (95%CI of the difference entirely above-5 letters). RESULTS Of the 318 participants, the mean (SD) age was 70.6 (8.2) years, 96 (30.2%) were women, and 152 (47.8%) were Japanese. Monotherapy with IAI was noninferior to IAI/PDT for the primary end point (+10.7 vs +10.8 letters, respectively; 95%CI,-2.9 to 1.6; P =.55), with few participants requiring rescue therapy (19 [12.1%] vs 23 [14.3%], respectively). Participants in both treatment groups had similar reductions in central subfield thickness from baseline to week 52 (-137.7 [IAI monotherapy] vs-143.5 μm [IAI/PDT]). At week 52, 49 (38.9%) and 60 participants (44.8%) had no polypoidal lesions observed on indocyanine green angiography in the IAI monotherapy and IAI/PDT groups, respectively. Furthermore, 116 (81.7%) and 136 (88.9%), respectively, had no polypoidal lesions with leakage. The most frequent ocular adverse events were conjunctival hemorrhage (IAI monotherapy, 8 [5.1%]) and dry eye (IAI/PDT, 9 [5.6%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Improvement in visual and/or functional outcomeswas achieved in more than 85%of participants who were treated with IAI monotherapy, with no signs of leakage from polypoidal lesions in more than 80%. As fewer than 15%met the criteria of a suboptimal response to receive PDT, the potential benefit of adding PDT cannot be determined. ? 2018 American Medical Association.",,"aflibercept; aflibercept; angiogenesis inhibitor; fusion protein; photosensitizing agent; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin receptor; VEGFA protein, human; aged; Article; Australia; best corrected visual acuity; central subfield thickness; conjunctival hemorrhage; controlled study; double blind procedure; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; dry eye; female; Germany; Hong Kong; human; Hungary; Japan; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; multicenter study; outcome assessment; phase 3 clinical trial; phase 4 clinical trial; photodynamic therapy; polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; retina hemorrhage; Singapore; South Korea; Taiwan; visual acuity; visual impairment; visual system parameters; vitreous hemorrhage; choroid; clinical trial; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; eye fundus; intravitreal drug administration; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; pathophysiology; photochemotherapy; physiology; polyp; subretinal neovascularization; treatment outcome; vascularization; Aged; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Choroid; Choroidal Neovascularization; Double-Blind Method; Female; Fundus Oculi; Humans; Intravitreal Injections; Male; Middle Aged; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Polyps; Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A; Visual Acuity",2-s2.0-85050893479

In this Phase 3 study, we evaluated sofosbuvir–velpatasvir plus ribavirin in Japanese patients with genotype 1 or 2 HCV infection who previously received DAAs. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive sofosbuvir–velpatasvir plus ribavirin for 12 or 24?weeks. Randomization was stratified by HCV genotype and presence of cirrhosis. The primary endpoint was sustained virologic response 12-week post-treatment (SVR12). Results: Of 117 participants, 81% had HCV genotype 1 infection, 33% had cirrhosis, and 95% had NS5A resistance-associated substitutions (RAS) at baseline. Overall, SVR12 rates were 97% (58/60; 95% CI 88–100%) with 24?weeks of treatment and 82% (47/57; 95% CI 70–91%) with 12?weeks. For HCV genotype 1 and 2 infected patients, the SVR12 rates with 24?weeks of treatment were 98% and 92%, respectively. In both treatment groups, SVR12 rates in HCV genotype 1 patients were statistically superior to a historical control rate of 50% (p < 0.001). For patients with NS5A RASs at baseline, 85% (46/54) in the 12-week group and 96% (54/56) in the 24-week group achieved SVR12. The most common adverse events were upper respiratory tract viral infection, anemia, and headache. Three (2.6%) patients discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Conclusion: Sofosbuvir–velpatasvir plus ribavirin was highly effective and well tolerated in Japanese patients who previously failed a DAA-based regimen. Baseline NS5A RASs did not affect treatment outcomes. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Antiviral resistance; DAA-experienced; NS5A inhibitor; NS5B polymerase inhibitor; Salvage therapy,"antivirus agent; asunaprevir; daclatasvir; direct acting antiviral agent; elbasvir; glecaprevir; hemoglobin; ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir; nonstructural protein 5A; ombitasvir; paritaprevir; pibrentasvir; ribavirin; simeprevir; sofosbuvir; sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir; telaprevir; unclassified drug; vaniprevir; antivirus agent; carbamic acid derivative; fused heterocyclic rings; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; velpatasvir; adult; aged; anemia; angiosarcoma; Article; backache; chronic hepatitis C; controlled study; depression; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug treatment failure; drug withdrawal; dry skin; eczema; female; gastroenteritis; headache; hepatic angiosarcoma; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; herpetic stomatitis; human; hyperglycemia; hyponatremia; Japanese (people); leukocyte count; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver sarcoma; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; malaise; male; multicenter study; nausea; neutrophil count; open study; pharyngitis; phase 3 clinical trial; platelet count; pneumonia; priority journal; pruritus; randomized controlled trial; rash; relapse; respiratory tract inflammation; side effect; stomatitis; sustained virologic response; treatment duration; upper abdominal pain; viral upper respiratory tract infection; virus resistance; chronic hepatitis C; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; drug administration; genetics; genotype; Hepacivirus; Japan; middle aged; oral drug administration; treatment failure; very elderly; young adult; Administration, Oral; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Carbamates; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Ribavirin; Sofosbuvir; Sustained Virologic Response; Treatment Failure; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85050319613

We investigated the pulmonary and pleural toxicity of POT fibers with reference to 2 non-fibrous titanium dioxide nanoparticles (nTiO2), photoreactive anatase (a-nTiO2) and inert rutile (r-nTiO2). Ten-week-old male F344 rats were given 0.5 mL of 250 μg/mL suspensions of POT fibers, a-nTiO2, or r-nTiO2, 8 times (1 mg/rat) over a 15-day period by trans-tracheal intrapulmonary spraying (TIPS). Rats were killed at 6 hours and at 4 weeks after the last TIPS dose. Alveolar macrophages were significantly increased in all treatment groups at 6 hours and at 4 weeks. At week 4, a-nTiO2 and r-nTiO2 were largely cleared from the lung whereas a major fraction of POT fibers were not cleared. In the bronchoalveolar lavage, alkaline phosphatase activity was elevated in all treatment groups, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity was elevated in the a-nTiO2 and POT groups. In lung tissue, oxidative stress index and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) index were elevated in the a-nTiO2 and POT groups, and there was a significant elevation in C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2) mRNA and protein in the POT group. In pleural cavity lavage, total protein was elevated in all 3 treatment groups, and LDH activity was elevated in the a-nTiO2 and POT groups. Importantly, the PCNA index of the visceral mesothelium was increased in the POT group. Overall, POT fibers had greater biopersistence, induced higher expression of CCL2, and provoked a stronger tissue response than a-nTiO2 or r-nTiO2. ? 2018 The Authors.

Another key feature of PTSD is compromised function in wide-ranging cognitive domains. Increased peripheral inflammation can contribute to cognitive dysfunction, although this relationship has not been studied in patients with PTSD. Here, we examined blood inflammatory markers in adult patients with PTSD compared to healthy controls taking account of potentially confounding effects of childhood maltreatment and comorbid major depressive disorder (MDD), and explored the association between inflammation and cognition. We enrolled 40 women with PTSD, most of whom developed the disorder after interpersonal violence during adulthood, and 65 healthy control women. Diagnoses were made based on DSM-IV. History of childhood maltreatment was assessed using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). Cognitive function was assessed using the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Blood samples were collected for the measurement of 5 inflammatory markers including interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble IL-6 receptor, interleukin-1β, high-sensitivity tumor necrosis factor-α, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Compared to controls, patients with PTSD showed significantly higher IL-6 levels (p = 0.009) and lower scores on all RBANS domains (all p < 0.01). IL-6 levels in patients were not significantly associated with the presence/absence of comorbid MDD or CTQ scores. IL-6 levels in patients were significantly negatively correlated with RBANS visuospatial construction (p = 0.046), language (p = 0.008), attention (p = 0.036) and total score (p = 0.008). These results suggest that elevated IL-6 is associated with PTSD and that the lower cognitive function in PTSD may be due at least partly to increased inflammation. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Cognitive function; Inflammation; Interleukin-6 (IL-6); Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),"C reactive protein; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; interleukin 6 receptor; tumor necrosis factor; C reactive protein; cytokine; adult; adulthood; Article; blood sampling; Childhood Trauma Questionnaire; clinical article; cognition; cognition assessment; comorbidity; controlled study; DSM-IV; female; human; major depression; multicenter study; neuropsychological test; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; repeatable battery for the assessment of neuropsychological status; violence; blood; cognitive defect; complication; metabolism; middle aged; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychological rating scale; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; C-Reactive Protein; Cognition Disorders; Cytokines; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85045747567

Almost all reported KMT2B mutations occurred de novo in the paternal germline or in the early development of the patient. We describe clinico-genetic features on four Japanese patients with novel de novo mutations and demonstrate the phenotypic spectrum of KMT2B mutations. Methods: We performed genetic studies, including trio-based whole exome sequencing (WES), in a cohort of Japanese patients with a seemingly sporadic early-onset generalized combined dystonia. Potential effects by the identified nucleotide variations were evaluated biologically. Genotype-phenotype correlations were also investigated. Results: Four patients had de novo heterozygous mutations in KMT2B, c.309delG, c.1656dupC, c.3325_3326insC, and c.5636delG. Biological analysis of KMT2B mRNA levels showed a reduced expression of mutant transcript frame. All patients presented with motor milestone delay, microcephaly, mild psychomotor impairment, childhood-onset generalized dystonia and superimposed choreoathetosis or myoclonus. One patient cannot stand due to axial hypotonia associated with cerebellar dysfunction. Three patients had bilateral globus pallidal deep brain stimulation (DBS) with excellent or partial response. Conclusions: We further demonstrate the allelic heterogeneity and phenotypic variations of KMT2B-associated disease. Haploinsufficiency is one of molecular pathomechanisms underlying the disease. Cardinal clinical features include combined dystonia accompanying mild psychomotor disability. Cerebellum would be affected in KMT2B-associated disease. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Dystonia; KMT2B; Microcephaly; Myoclonus; Short stature,"histone methyltransferase; lysine specific histone methyltransferase 2B; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; histone lysine methyltransferase; KMT2B protein, human; messenger RNA; adolescent; adult; aged; allele; animal tissue; Article; biological activity; body weight; brain depth stimulation; brain perfusion; Burke Fahn Marsden dystonia rating scale; cerebellum disease; choreoathetosis; clinical article; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; developmental delay; disease association; disease severity; dysarthrophonia; female; gene expression regulation; gene mutation; generalized dystonia; genetic analysis; genetic association; genetic heterogeneity; genetic transcription; genetic variability; genotype phenotype correlation; globus pallidus; haploinsufficiency; human; intellectual impairment; Japanese (people); KMT2B gene; language delay; limit of quantitation; male; microcephaly; molecular interaction; muscle hypotonia; musculoskeletal disease assessment; myoclonus; neuroimaging; neurologic disease assessment; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; pathogenesis; phenotype; priority journal; psychomotor disorder; rat; short stature; single nucleotide polymorphism; spectrum; speech delay; speech disorder; T cell culture; therapy effect; treatment response; voice; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; whole exome sequencing; writer's cramp; young adult; developmental disorder; dwarfism; dystonic disorder; frameshift mutation; genetics; phenotype; Adolescent; Adult; Cohort Studies; Developmental Disabilities; Dwarfism; Dystonic Disorders; Female; Frameshift Mutation; Haploinsufficiency; Histone-Lysine N-Methyltransferase; Humans; Male; Microcephaly; Myoclonus; Phenotype; RNA, Messenger; Whole Exome Sequencing; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85045083647

Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated that serum M2BPGi levels???1.215 COI at 48?weeks were associated with HCC development [hazard ratio (HR) 5.73; p???0.001]. Multivariate analysis showed that male sex (HR 5.6; p?=?0.01), AFP???9.65?ng/ml (HR 22.01; p???0.001), M2BPGi???1.215 (HR 5.07; p?=?0.004) at 48?weeks were significant independent predictive factors for HCC development. Based on a scoring system consisting of three factors above described, Kaplan–Meier analysis for four groups (score 0, 1, 2,???3), revealed significant differences in cumulative HCC occurrence for each group within 2?years. The rate of incidence of HCC was 0, 5.4, 23.4, and 75% in each group, respectively. Conclusions: In patients receiving NA therapy, higher M2BPGi at 48?weeks, as well as male sex and higher AFP at 48?weeks were independent risk factors for HCC development. ? 2017, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Alpha-fetoprotein; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Mac-2-binding protein glycosylation isomer; Nucleot(s)ide analogue,"alanine aminotransferase; alpha fetoprotein; binding protein; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; mac 2 binding protein; nucleotide derivative; tenofovir; tenofovir disoproxil; unclassified drug; virus DNA; alpha fetoprotein; antivirus agent; carrier protein; entecavir; glycoprotein; guanine; LGALS3BP protein, human; tumor antigen; tumor marker; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; chronic hepatitis B; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; glycosylation; human; isomer; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; priority journal; analogs and derivatives; blood; chronic hepatitis B; complication; drug effect; Hepatitis B virus; incidence; Japan; Kaplan Meier method; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; methodology; middle aged; multivariate analysis; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; sex factor; virology; Adult; alpha-Fetoproteins; Antigens, Neoplasm; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Carrier Proteins; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glycoproteins; Guanine; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Proportional Hazards Models; Research Design; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Tenofovir",2-s2.0-85039731057

A post-marketing surveillance (PMS) study suggested that the association was specific for ipragliflozin and, to a lesser extent for dapagliflozin. These studies were performed to confirm the association of 6 SGLT2 inhibitors with serious skin disorders in a clinical setting, to elucidate the role of melanin in serious skin disorders and to understand the underlying mechanisms. Methods: The latest PMS records were retrieved from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database, and the associations were analyzed by data mining techniques. In silico 3-D docking simulation of SGLT2 inhibitors with melanin was performed using the MOE software. The skin tissue distribution of SGLT2 inhibitors was evaluated using albino rats after oral administration at clinical doses. Results: The adjusted reporting odds ratio (95% confidential limit) was 1.667 (1.415, 1.963) for ipragliflozin, 0.514 (0.317, 0.835) for dapagliflozin, 0.149 (0.048, 0.465) for tofogliflozin, 0.624 (0.331, 1.177) for luseogliflozin, 0.590 (0.277, 1.257) for canagliflozin and 0.293 (0.073, 1.187) for empagliflozin, when drugs other than the SGLT2 inhibitors were referred, and the association was detected only for ipragliflozin in clinical use. In silico 3-D docking simulation suggested the influence of melanin in ipragliflozin-specific serious skin disorders. The skin tissue-to-plasma concentration ratio of ipragliflozin was 0.45 ± 0.20 (±SD) at 1 hr after administration and increased in a time-dependent manner to 5.82 ± 3.66 at 24 hr (p<0.05), but not in case of other SGLT2 inhibitors. Conclusions: Serious skin disorders were suggested to be specific for ipragliflozin. Interaction with melanin might be implicated in ipragliflozin-specific serious skin disorders. Ipragliflozin was retained in the skin tissue, which suggested its interaction with the skin tissue in serious skin disorders. ?

To elucidate the medication adherence and treatment satisfaction, we performed a questionnaire survey using the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) and nine-item Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM-9) of 163 psoriatic patients who regularly visited hospitals or clinics. To assess the relationship between the MMAS-8/TSQM-9 outcomes and severity of psoriasis, two different clinical severity indices were used: the Psoriasis Area and the Severity Index (PASI) for disease severity and the Psoriasis Disability Index (PDI) for quality of life (QOL) impairment. The MMAS-8 score for oral medication was significantly higher than that for topical medication. The oral and topical MMAS-8 scores were significantly correlated with the PDI score, but not with the PASI score, indicating that QOL impairment lowered treatment motivation. All of the TSQM-9 domain scores (effectiveness, convenience and global satisfaction) were significantly correlated with both the PASI and PDI scores, suggesting that patients whose skin and QOL conditions were under good control had high satisfaction with treatment.

To investigate any potential association between the vaccine and reported symptoms, Nagoya City conducted a questionnaire-based survey. Participants were 71,177 female residents of Nagoya City born between April 2, 1994 and April 1, 2001. The anonymous postal questionnaire investigated the onset of 24 symptoms (primary outcome), associated hospital visits, frequency, and influence on school attendance. Totally, 29,846 residents responded. No significant increase in occurrence of any of the 24 reported post-HPV vaccination symptoms was found. The vaccine was associated with increased age-adjusted odds of hospital visits for “abnormal amount of menstrual bleeding” (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 1.13–1.82), “irregular menstruation” (OR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.12–1.49), “severe headaches” (OR: 1.19, 95% CI: 1.02–1.39), and chronic, persisting “abnormal amount of menstrual bleeding” (OR 1.41, 95% CI: 1.11–1.79).

Methods: This retrospective, multicenter study of 12-week OBT/PTV/r therapy included genotype 1b patients with non-dialysis CKD. Chronic kidney disease was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;60?mL/min/1.73?m2. Virologic responses and treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) in patients with CKD were compared with those in patients without CKD. Results: Two hundred and thirty-five patients with a median age of 67?years (range, 27–89?years) were enrolled, consisting of 181 patients without CKD and 54 patients with CKD. Overall, the rates of rapid virologic response (RVR), end of treatment response (ETR), and sustained virologic response (SVR) were 78.7%, 98.7%, and 98.7%, respectively. Among the 181 non-CKD patients, the rates were 77.3% (140/181), 98.9% (179/181), and 98.9% (179/181), respectively. Among the 54 CKD patients, the rates were 83.3% (45/54), 98.1% (53/54), and 98.1% (53/54), respectively. There were no significant differences in the virologic response rates between the two groups (P = 0.449 for RVR, 0.545 for ETR, and 0.545 for SVR). In the CKD group, the eGFR level did not significantly change throughout the treatment period. There was no significant difference in the incidence of TEAEs or treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs between the two groups.

From this concept, the random component in physiological signals is assumed to increase during developmental and degenerative stages of life. To examine this hypothesis, we measured the age-dependent changes in the random component of heart rate variability (HRV) in 24-h electrocardiography (ECG) big data and in patients with a developmental disorder (DD). Approach: We measured separately regulated and random components of HRV with autoregressive (AR) model fitting, by which the ratio of random component as the fractional variance of AR residual time series. From the ALLSTAR database of about 304 000 ambulatory 24-h ECGs, we randomly extracted the data of 1930 men and 1987 women uniformly for all ages from 0 to 100 years old (100 cases per 5-year strata for each sex). Data were also obtained from male pediatric patients with DD (age 10-15 years). Main results: While the variance of the regulated component of HRV increased from age 0 to 20, decreased with age until 40, and reached a plateau in both sexes, the ratio of the random component was high at birth, decreased with age until 35 in men and 30 in women, and increased again after 75 in men and 85 in women (P < 0.0001 for all). In patients with a DD, the ratio of the random component was significantly lower than that in age-and-sex matched subjects in the database. Significance: We found that the ratio of the random component of HRV is increased during developmental and degenerative stages of life and that it may be reduced in DD patients during their development. ? 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",aging; attractor; autoregressive model; big data; developmental disorder; heart rate variability; Langevin equation,"adolescent; adult; aged; aging; child; developmental disorder; electrocardiography; female; heart rate; human; infant; male; middle aged; newborn; pathophysiology; physiology; preschool child; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Child; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Electrocardiography; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85049033356

Altered miRNA profiles could represent a defensive response against the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Endogenous miRNAs have lower toxic effects than other gene silencing methods, thus enhancing the expression of defensive miRNA could be an effective therapy. However, little is known about the potential of targeting miRNAs for the treatment of AD. Here, we examined the function of the miR-200 family (miR-200a, -141, -429, -200b, -200c), identified using miRNA microarray analysis of cortical tissue from Tg2576 transgenic mice. In murine primary neurons, we found that upregulation of miR-200b or -200c was induced by the addition of amyloid beta (Aβ). Neurons transfected with miR-200b or -200c reduced secretion of Aβ in conditioned medium. Moreover, mice infused with miR-200b/c into the brain were relieved of memory impairments induced by intracerebroventricular injection of oligomeric Aβ, and demonstrated proper spatial learning in the Barnes maze. To gain further understanding of the relationship between miR-200b/c and Aβ, we identified target mRNAs via an RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation-microarray assay. Western blot analysis showed that expression of ribosomal protein S6 kinase B1 (S6K1), a candidate target, was inhibited by miR-200c. S6K1, a downstream effector of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), serves as a negative feedback mediator that phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate 1 at serine residues (IRS-1pSer). S6K1-dependent IRS-1pSer suppresses insulin signaling leading to insulin resistance, which is frequently observed in AD brains. Notably, miR-200b/c transfection of SH-SY5Y cells reduced the levels of IRS-1pSer. This finding indicates that miR-200b/ c has the potential to alleviate insulin resistance via modulation of S6K1. Taken together, miR-200b/c may contribute to reduce Aβ secretion and Aβ-induced cognitive impairment by promoting insulin signaling. ? 2018 Higaki et al.

Study design: This study was a multicenter prospective cohort study. The present data were collected from women whose NIPT results were negative. The relationships between the fetal fractions and the gestational age, maternal weight and height, and incidences of miscarriage, preterm delivery, and pregnancy complications including GDM, HDP and placental abruption were assessed. Results: A total of 5582 pregnant women with verified NIPT negative results were registered in the study. The demographic characteristics of the study populations were statistically analyzed, and the women with HDP tended to have a low fetal fraction in samples taken during early gestation.

The aim of the present study was to determine the mechanism underlying the apoptosisinducing effect of apigenin in colon cancer. Apigenin reduced the proliferation of colon cancer cell lines, stimulated the cleavage of PARP and induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner. Apigenin treatment also suppressed the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. Small interfering RNA was used to knockdown Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression alone and in concert, and the proliferation and apoptosis of cancer cells were subsequently measured. The knockdown of Bcl-xL and Mcl-1 expression together markedly suppressed cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. Apigenin treatment also inhibited the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which targets Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. The results of the current study therefore determined that apigenin induces the apoptosis of colon cancer cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of STAT3 and consequently downregulates the anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-xL and Mcl-1. ? 2018 Spandidos Publications.

Objective: To examine the predictors of increased hospital stay in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion. Summary of Background Data: As policy makers and hospitals are increasingly looking to cut costs, length of stay (LOS) after surgery has come into focus as an area for improvement. Despite this, there is limited research about the factors contributing to increased LOS for AIS patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion. Methods: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify pediatric patients with idiopathic scoliosis who underwent posterior spinal fusion from 2004 to 2009, using the International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Patient demographics, surgical variables, hospital characteristics, and in-hospital outcomes were retrieved. LOS was divided into two groups (longer- and shorter-stay groups) by its average. Longer stay was defined as ?6 days. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of increased LOS in AIS patients undergoing posterior spinal fusion. Results: Significant predictors of increased LOS in posterior spinal fusion for AIS patients included increased Elixhauser Comorbidity Score, number of fused levels ?9 vertebrae, teaching hospital status, in-hospital complications, and nonroutine disposition. Wound-related complications were the strongest predictor and patients with wound-related complications were 3.14-fold more likely to have an increased LOS compared to those without wound-related complications. Conclusions: This study identified significant predictors of increased hospital stay in posterior spinal fusion for pediatric patients with idiopathic scoliosis and patients at higher risk of longer hospitalization can be recognized. Eventually these data are expected to help optimize LOS and cost containment. ? 2017 Scoliosis Research Society",Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; Increased hospital stay; Nationwide inpatient sample; Posterior spinal fusion; Predictor,adolescent; adolescent idiopathic scoliosis; adult; Article; child; child hospitalization; demography; female; heart disease; hematoma; human; ICD-9-CM; kidney disease; length of stay; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; neurological complication; posterior spine fusion; postoperative complication; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; school child; seroma; surgical infection; urinary tract disease; wound dehiscence; young adult; retrospective study; scoliosis; spine fusion; statistics and numerical data; United States; Adolescent; Child; Female; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Retrospective Studies; Scoliosis; Spinal Fusion; United States,2-s2.0-85032893501

Objective: To compare the effectiveness of extrafine ICSs (mass median aerodynamic diameter, <2 μm) versus fine-particle ICSs administered as ICS monotherapy or ICS-long-acting β-agonist combination therapy by conducting a meta-analysis of observational real-life asthma studies to estimate the treatment effect of extrafine ICSs. Methods: MEDLINE and EMBASE databases were reviewed for asthma observational comparative effectiveness studies from January 2004 to June 2016. Studies were included if they reported odds and relative risk ratios and met all inclusion criteria (Respiratory Effectiveness Group/European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology quality standards, comparison of extrafine ICSs with same or different ICS molecule, ?12-month follow-up). End-point data (asthma control, exacerbations, prescribed ICS dose) were pooled. Random-effects meta-analysis modeling was used. The study protocol is published in the PROSPERO register CRD42016039137. Results: Seven studies with 33,453 subjects aged 5 to 80 years met eligibility criteria for inclusion. Six studies used extrafine beclometasone propionate and 1 study used both extrafine beclometasone propionate and extrafine ciclesonide as comparators with fine-particle ICSs. The overall odds of achieving asthma control were significantly higher for extrafine ICSs compared with fine-particle ICSs (odds ratio, 1.34; 95% CI, 1.22-1.46). Overall exacerbation rate ratios (0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.97) and ICS dose (weighted mean difference, ?170 μg; 95% CI, ?222 to ?118 μg) were significantly lower for extrafine ICSs compared with fine-particle ICSs. Conclusions: This meta-analysis demonstrates that extrafine ICSs have significantly higher odds of achieving asthma control with lower exacerbation rates at significantly lower prescribed doses than fine-particle ICSs. ? 2017 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology",Asthma control; Conventional ICS; Extrafine beclometasone dipropionate; Extrafine ciclesonide; Extrafine-particle ICS; Fine-particle ICS; Inhaled corticosteroids; Observational studies; Real-life,"beclometasone dipropionate; budesonide; ciclesonide; fluticasone propionate; antiasthmatic agent; corticosteroid; Article; asthma; clinical protocol; combination chemotherapy; corticosteroid therapy; disease control; disease exacerbation; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug safety; follow up; human; meta analysis; monotherapy; particle size; practice guideline; publishing; risk factor; asthma; chemistry; inhalational drug administration; observational study; particle size; treatment outcome; Administration, Inhalation; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Anti-Asthmatic Agents; Asthma; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Particle Size; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85029586515

However, the PD-L1 expression, which is a predictor of the response to ICIs, is unclear in MPM. We studied the PD-L1 expression using four immunohistochemical assays (SP142, SP263, 28-8 and 22C3) in 32 MPM patients. The PD-L1 expression in tumor cells and immune cells was evaluated to clarify the rate of PD-L1 expression and the concordance among the four assays in MPM. The positivity rate of PD-L1 expression was 53.1% for SP142, 28.1% for SP263, 53.1% for 28-8, and 56.3% for 22C3. Nine cases were positive and 10 were negative for all assays. Discordance among the four assays was found in 13 cases. The concordance rates between SP142 and 22C3 and between 28-8 and 22C3 were the highest (84.4%). The concordance rates between SP263 and the other three assays were low (71.9% to 75.0%). The PD-L1 expression in MPM was almost equivalent for three of the assays. Given the cut-off values set in our study, these findings suggested that these assays, except for SP263, can be used for accurate PD-L1 immunostaining in MPM. ?

We found that liposomes co-encapsulating calcein (a water-soluble model drug and fluorescence marker) and talaporfin sodium (TPS, a water-soluble photosensitizer) released the drug upon irradiation with a near-infrared (NIR)-laser. The liposomes were composed of phospholipid (DSPC)/helper lipid (DOPE)/cholesterol/PEG-lipid (PEG2000-DSPE) at a molar ratio of 85/10/5/5 and released a large amount of drug (70%&lt;, within 10 min) upon irradiation, but no drug in the absence of NIR-laser irradiation and/or TPS. NIR-laser-triggered drug release was facilitated by the incorporation of DOPE into the liposomes, and the amount of DOPE incorporated affected drug leakage in the absence of NIR-laser-irradiation at 37 °C (body temperature). Drug leakage was tuned by incorporating cholesterol into the liposomes. NIR-laser-triggered drug release from the liposomes was confirmed using the anticancer drug gemcitabine. NIR-laser treatment of liposomes co-encapsulating gemcitabine and TPS provided the maximum cytotoxic effect towards EMT6/P cells.

In the current study curcumin is encapsulated in krill lipids-based liposomes (marinosomes) to develop a potential anticancer therapy from low-cost and readily available nutraceuticals. Reflux followed by thin drug-lipid film method is used successfully to incorporate the drug into the liposomal membrane at high encapsulation efficiency (EE). The curcumin-loaded marinosomes (CURMs) showed a powerful antioxidant activity (EC50 ≒ 4 μg/mL). Additionally, CURMs exhibited good physicochemical and oxidative stability after eight weeks’ storage at 4 °C. Furthermore, CURMs exhibited sustained release of about 30% of their curcumin content under in vitro culture conditions at 37 °C after 72 h. Consequently, CURMs showed its maximum cytotoxic effect (IC50; 11.7 ± 0.24 μg/ml) after incubation for 72 h against A549 lung cancer cells. Additionally, CURMs inhibited the proliferation of HUVECs in a dose-dependent manner with IC50 of 2.64 ± 0.21 μg/ml after incubation for 24 h.

Patients and methods: In this multi-institutional, randomized, phase III trial, patients were enrolled from 32 Japanese institutions. Key inclusion criteria were GC T1-2N0M0, age 20-80, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, and adequate organ function. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either SF of 66-70 Gy (33-35 fractions), or AF of 60-64.8 Gy (25-27 fractions). The primary end point was the proportion of 3-year PFS. The planned sample size was 360 with a non-inferiority margin of 5%. Results: Between 2007 and 2013, 370 patients were randomized (184/186 to SF/AF). Three-year PFS was 79.9% (95% confidence interval [CI] 73.4-85.4) for SF and 81.7% (95% CI 75.4-87.0) for AF (difference 1.8%, 91% CI-5.1% to 8.8%; onesided P=0.047 > 0.045). The cumulative incidences of local failure at 3 years for SF/AF were 15.9%/10.3%. No significant difference was observed in 3-year overall survival (OS) between SF and AF. Grade 3 or 4 acute and late toxicities developed in 22 (12.4%)/21 (11.5%) and 2 (1.1%)/1 (0.5%) in the SF/AF arms. Conclusion: Although the non-inferiority of AF was not confirmed statistically, the similar efficacy and toxicity of AF compared with SF, as well as the practical convenience of its fewer treatment sessions, suggest the potential of AF as a treatment option for early GC. ?

Discontinuation of leuprorelin acetate or bicalutamide due to adverse event occurred in one patient. Conclusion: This study suggests that CAB has equivalent efficacy and less toxicity for patients with AR-positive RM or unresectable LA SGC compared with conventional chemotherapy, which warrants further study. ?

We report a subgroup analysis of East Asian (Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese) patients from POLLUX based on a longer follow-up of 24.7 months. Median progression-free survival was not reached (NR) for DRd vs. 13.8 months for Rd (hazard ratio [HR], 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.23-0.76), and overall response rates were higher for DRd vs. Rd (90.2 vs. 72.1%). DRd extended the median duration of response vs. Rd (NR vs. 20.2 months), and minimal residual disease-negative rates at the 10 -5 sensitivity threshold were 21.2 vs. 9.1% for DRd vs. Rd. No new safety signals were observed. Similar efficacy and safety were observed in the smaller subgroup of Japanese patients treated with DRd vs. Rd. These results demonstrate favorable efficacy and safety of DRd vs. Rd in East Asian patients and also in the Japanese-only patient subgroup that are consistent with findings in the overall patient population of POLLUX. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"daratumumab; dexamethasone; lenalidomide; antineoplastic agent; daratumumab; dexamethasone; lenalidomide; monoclonal antibody; adult; aged; anemia; Article; Bowen disease; cancer recurrence; cataract; comparative study; constipation; controlled study; coughing; decreased appetite; diarrhea; disease exacerbation; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; dyspnea; fatigue; febrile neutropenia; female; fever; follow up; human; hyperglycemia; hypertransaminasemia; hypophosphatemia; infusion related reaction; insomnia; Japanese (people); kidney disease; Korean (people); leukocytosis; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; lymphoproliferative disease; major clinical study; male; minimal residual disease; multiple cycle treatment; multiple myeloma; multiple organ failure; nausea; neutropenia; phase 3 clinical trial; pneumonia; progression free survival; randomized controlled trial; rhinopharyngitis; second cancer; somnolence; Taiwanese; thrombocytopenia; treatment outcome; treatment response; upper respiratory tract infection; clinical trial; drug resistance; middle aged; multiple myeloma; recurrent disease; retreatment; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Dexamethasone; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Humans; Lenalidomide; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Recurrence; Retreatment; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85046355740

DNA, a representative DAMP in radiotherapy, activates the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway which enhances the immune response. However, the immune response does not always parallel the inflammation associated with radiotherapy. This lack of correspondence may, in part, explain the radiation-resistance of tumors. Additive immunotherapy is expected to revive tumor-specific CTL facilitating radiation-resistant tumor shrinkage. Herein pre-administration of the double-stranded RNA, polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), in conjunction with radiotherapy, was shown to foster tumor suppression in mice bearing radioresistant, ovalbumin-expressing Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC). Extrinsic injection of tumor antigen was not required for tumor suppression. No STING- and CTL-response was induced by radiation in the implant tumor. PolyI:C was more effective for induction of tumor growth retardation at 1 day before radiation than at post-treatment. PolyI:C targeted Toll-like receptor 3 with minimal effect on the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein pathway. Likewise, the STING pathway barely contributed to LLC tumor suppression. PolyI:C primed antigen-presenting dendritic cells in draining lymph nodes to induce proliferation of antigen-specific CTL. By combination therapy, CTL efficiently infiltrated into tumors with upregulation of relevant chemokine transcripts. Batf3-positive DC and CD8+ T cells were essential for therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, polyI:C was shown to stimulate tumor-associated macrophages and release tumor necrosis factor alpha, which acted on tumor cells and increased sensitivity to radiation. Hence, polyI:C treatment prior to radiotherapy potentially induces tumor suppression by boosting CTL-dependent and macrophage-mediated anti-tumor responses. Eventually, polyI:C and radiotherapy in combination would be a promising therapeutic strategy for radiation-resistant tumors. ? 2018 The Authors.

This study sought to clarify the clinical course in AIP patients with hesitation for steroid treatment. Methods: We collected clinical data for AIP patients from high-volume centers in Japan. Data for AIP patients with and those without steroid treatment (steroid treatment vs. wait and see policy or W&S) were then compared. The primary point was the relapse-free survival rate (RFS) in patients with and those without steroid treatment, as determined using Kaplan–Meier curve. The secondary point was the identification of predictors of remission and risks of relapse in AIP patients without steroid treatment. Results: There were 510 AIP patients in the steroid treatment group and 97 patients in the W&S group. Overall, 55.7% (54/97) of type 1 AIP patients in the W&S group experienced transient remission without steroid treatment. The W&S group had a significantly higher patient age and significantly lower incidences of jaundice, diffuse pancreas swelling, proximal-type sclerosing cholangitis, and stent placement and a lower remission rate than the steroid treatment group (each P?<?0.05). The RFS reached a plateau at 10?years in both the W&S group (50%) and steroid treatment group (52.9%). As for the RFS (W&S vs. group with steroid), 89.4% vs. 74.4% within 3?years, 81.8% vs. 65.3% within 5?years, and 50% vs. 52.9% within 10?years (log-rank, P?=?0.064). Female gender (OR 0.340, P?=?0.027) and stent placement for jaundice (OR?4.552, P?=?0.008) were identified as predictors of transient remission in the W&S group. New-onset diabetes mellitus (OR?8.333, P?=?0.012) and the presence of extensive multi-organ involvement (OR?35, P?=?0.006) were identified as risks of relapse in the W&S group. Conclusion: Some type 1 AIP patients without steroid treatment experience transient remission. These cases tend to have lower disease activities than AIP patients receiving steroids. Female gender and stent placement for jaundice may be predictors of transient remission among patients not receiving steroid treatment, however, relapses can occur in these patients with new-onset diabetes mellitus and the presence of extensive multi-organ involvement. Therefore, steroid treatment is still imperative for these patients. ? 2018 Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery",Autoimmune pancreatitis; Relapse; Remission; Stent; Steroid treatment,"advanced cancer; Article; bile duct carcinoma; bile leakage; cancer mortality; cancer surgery; choledochojejunostomy; gallbladder carcinoma; human; liver caudate lobe; liver resection; morbidity; pancreaticoduodenectomy; radical resection; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; surgeon; surgical technique; treatment outcome; adolescent; adult; aged; autoimmune disease; chronic pancreatitis; clinical trial; dose response; female; incidence; Japan; male; middle aged; multicenter study; recurrent disease; remission; time to treatment; very elderly; young adult; glucocorticoid; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Autoimmune Diseases; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Recurrence; Remission Induction; Time-to-Treatment; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85044286610

Class III β-tubulin (TUBB3) has been reported to be a predictive marker for taxane resistance in various tumors. However, the correlation between TUBB3 expression and the response to nab-P + Gem in patients with UR-PDAC has not been evaluated. We retrospectively reviewed 75 patients with UR-PDAC who received nab-P + Gem. TUBB3 expression was examined immunohistochemically in specimens obtained by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA). From 67 analyzable specimens that were available for TUBB3 staining, 14 (21%) were negative for TUBB3 immunostaining and 53 (79%) were positive. Patients with negative TUBB3 expression showed a significantly higher disease control rate (100% vs. 64.2%; P =.008) and longer progression-free survival (PFS); (7.1 months vs. 3.7 months; log-rank test, P =.036) than those of patients with positive. Furthermore, negative TUBB3 expression was an independent predictive marker of a prolonged PFS on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio, 2.41; 95% confidence interval, 1.11-5.24; P =.026). Our data indicate that an absence of TUBB3 expression in specimens obtained by EUS-FNA may be a favorable predictive marker of the response to nab-P + Gem in patients with UR-PDAC, highlighting its use as a potential new biomarker for treatment optimization. ? 2018",Class III β-tubulin; EUS-FNA; Nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine; TUBB3; Unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma,"beta tubulin; beta tubulin class III; gemcitabine; paclitaxel; unclassified drug; 130-nm albumin-bound paclitaxel; albuminoid; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic antimetabolite; deoxycytidine; gemcitabine; paclitaxel; TUBB3 protein, human; tubulin; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle biopsy; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; log rank test; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; pancreas adenocarcinoma; progression free survival; protein expression; retrospective study; treatment response; unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; unresectable pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; analogs and derivatives; metabolism; middle aged; pancreas carcinoma; pancreas tumor; pathology; prognosis; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Albumins; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Deoxycytidine; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Paclitaxel; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Tubulin",2-s2.0-85044136358

Cigarette smoke inhalation in mice and orally administered nicotine in rats and mice increased urothelial cell proliferation. Nicotine, a major component of smoke, induced cell proliferation in multiple cell types in vitro. In the present study, the enhancing effects of nicotine on F344 rat bladder carcinogenesis induced by N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) were examined. Nicotine administered in drinking water for 32 weeks following 4 weeks of BBN treatment significantly increased the incidence and number of urothelial carcinomas dose-dependently. Ki67 and pSTAT3 labeling indices and expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor alpha 7 (nAChRα7) in non-tumor bladder urothelial lesions were significantly increased by nicotine, but the TUNEL assay for apoptosis showed no increase. In a 4 week study, inhibitors of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor decreased nicotine-induced urothelial simple hyperplasia and Ki67 labeling index in the bladder and kidney pelvis at a single cytotoxic dose of nicotine (40 ppm). Urothelial cytotoxicity with regenerative proliferation was observed by light and scanning electron microscopy. In vitro, nicotine was not cytotoxic to rat or human immortalized urothelial cells (do not express nicotine receptors) below millimolar concentrations, nor in human RT4, T24 or UMUC3 urothelial carcinoma cells (express nicotine receptors). However, nicotine slightly, but statistically significantly, increased cell proliferation at micromolar concentrations in human urothelial carcinoma cells. These data suggest that nicotine enhances urinary bladder carcinogenesis by inducing cytotoxicity with regenerative proliferation. The possible role of direct mitogenesis, involving nAChR and STAT3 signaling and of nicotine receptors requires further investigation at non-cytotoxic doses of nicotine. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN); Nicotine; Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Rat; Urinary bladder carcinogenesis,"bungarotoxin receptor; cotinine; cytokeratin 5; drinking water; Ki 67 antigen; n butyl n (4 hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine; nicotine; nicotine tartrate; nicotinic receptor; STAT3 protein; nicotine; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; bladder; bladder carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; concentration process; controlled study; cytotoxicity; Fischer 344 rat; human; human cell; hyperplasia; in vitro study; incidence; kidney pelvis; labeling index; male; mitogenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rat; RT-4 cell line; scanning electron microscopy; T24 cell line; transitional cell carcinoma; TUNEL assay; UM-UC-3 cell line; animal; bladder; bladder tumor; body weight; carcinogenesis; cell line; cell proliferation; chemically induced; drug effect; oral drug administration; pathology; randomization; Administration, Oral; Animals; Body Weight; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Humans; Male; Nicotine; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Urinary Bladder; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85043378246

Several scoring systems (HCT-specific comorbidity index [HCT-CI]/modified European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score [mEBMT]) have been adopted to predict HCT outcomes in other hematologic malignancies. We retrospectively evaluated HCT-CI and mEBMT to predict nonrelapse mortality (NRM) in 824 ATL patients registered in the Japan Society for Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation TRUMP database, from 2008 until 2013. A higher HCT-CI was associated with greater NRM when comparing HCT-CI 0 versus HCT-CI 1 to 3 and HCT-CI 0 versus HCT-CI ? 4. A higher mEBMT score was not associated with higher NRM when comparing mEBMT 0 to 3 with 4 to 6. Because ATL patients are older and consequently at risk of additional complications, we developed an optimized prognostic index for ATL (ATL-HCT-PI) using known risk factors: age, HCT-CI, and donor–recipient sex combination. The ATL-HCT-PI scores effectively predicted the 2-year NRM (22.0%, 27.7%, and 44.4%, respectively). Therefore, the newly developed ATL-HCT-PI, in combination with other risk factors, is more useful for predicting NRM in HCT for ATL patients. ? 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation",Adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma; Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation; Comorbidities; Hematologic malignancies; Mortality,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Article; cancer mortality; cancer registry; cancer risk; child; comorbidity assessment; female; hematopoietic cell transplantation specific comorbidity index; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; modified European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation risk score; prognostic assessment; retrospective study; risk assessment; scoring system; T cell leukemia; allograft; clinical trial; disease free survival; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; mortality; multicenter study; risk assessment; survival rate; T cell leukemia; Adult; Aged; Allografts; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85039424663

The purpose of this study was to evaluate differences in acute toxicity among patients with localized PCa treated with either conventional fractionated proton therapy (CFPT) or HFPT. Methods: A total of 526 eligible patients treated with proton therapy between February 2013 and May 2016 in three phase II trials were analyzed. We prescribed 74 gray relative biological effectiveness equivalents [Gy (RBE)]/37 fractions for low-risk patients and 78?Gy (RBE)/39 fractions for intermediate- and high-risk patients in the CFPT group (n?=?254) and 60?Gy (RBE)/20 fractions for low-risk and 63?Gy (RBE)/21 fractions for intermediate- and high-risk patients in the HFPT group (n?=?272). Patients were evaluated for acute toxicity with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0, and urinary quality-of-life change using the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS). Results: No grade??3 acute toxicity was observed in either group. Among acute genitourinary toxicities, grade 2 rates were 15% (n?=?38) in CFPT and 5.9% (n?=?16) in HFPT (P?? 0.001). The median baseline IPSSs of the CFPT and HFPT groups were 7 (0–29) and 6 (0–31), respectively (P?=?0.70). One-month post-treatment scores were 9 (0–32) and 11 (0–32), respectively (P?=?0.036), and 6-month post-treatment scores were 7 (0–30) and 7 (0–33), respectively (P?=?0.88). There were no significant differences in acute gastrointestinal toxicity between the two groups. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated the safety of HFPT for localized PCa patients in terms of acute toxicity. ? 2017, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Acute toxicity; Hypofractionation; International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS); Prostate cancer; Proton therapy,"acute toxicity; adult; aged; Article; cancer localization; clinical assessment; controlled study; dermatitis; female; follow up; gastrointestinal toxicity; high risk patient; high risk population; human; hypertension; hypofractionated radiotherapy; International Prostate Symptom Score; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; patient-reported outcome; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; prostate cancer; proton therapy; quality of life; rectum hemorrhage; relative biologic effectiveness; treatment planning; clinical trial; gastrointestinal disease; image guided radiotherapy; middle aged; prostate tumor; proton therapy; radiation dose fractionation; radiation injury; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Dose Fractionation; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prostatic Neoplasms; Proton Therapy; Radiation Injuries; Radiotherapy, Image-Guided; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85032964848

Acute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is an acute flaccid paralysis syndrome with spinal motor neuron involvement of unknown etiology. We investigated the characteristics and prognostic factors of AFM clusters coincident with an enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) outbreak in Japan during autumn 2015. Methods. An AFM case series study was conducted following a nationwide survey from August to December 2015. Radiographic and neurophysiologic data were subjected to centralized review, and virology studies were conducted for available specimens. Results. Fifty-nine AFM cases (58 definite, 1 probable) were identified, including 55 children and 4 adults (median age, 4.4 years). Te AFM epidemic curve showed strong temporal correlation with EV-D68 detection from pathogen surveillance, but not with other pathogens. EV-D68 was detected in 9 patients: 5 in nasopharyngeal, 2 in stool, 1 in cerebrospinal fluid (adult case), and 1 in tracheal aspiration, nasopharyngeal, and serum samples (a pediatric case with preceding steroid usage). Cases exhibited heterogeneous paralysis patterns from 1-to 4-limb involvement, but all definite cases had longitudinal spinal gray matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (median, 20 spinal segments). Cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis was observed in 50 of 59 cases (85%), and 8 of 29 (28%) were positive for antiganglioside antibodies, as frequently observed in Guillain-Barr? syndrome. Fifty-two patients showed variable residual weakness at follow-up. Good prognostic factors included a pretreatment manual muscle strength test unit score >3, normal F-wave persistence, and EV-D68-negative status. Conclusions. EV-D68 may be one of the causative agents for AFM, while host susceptibility factors such as immune response could contribute to AFM development. ?

This retrospective analysis comprised prostate cancer patients treated with PT at seven centers between January 2008 and December 2011 and was approved by each Institutional Review Board. The NCCN classification was used. Biochemical relapse was based on the Phoenix definition (nadir?+?2.0?ng/mL). Toxicities were evaluated with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. There were 215, 520, and 556 patients in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups, respectively. The median follow-up period of surviving patients was 69?months (range: 7–107). Among all patients, 98.8% were treated using a conventional fractionation schedule and 1.2% with a hypofractionation schedule; 58.5% and 21.5% received neoadjuvant and adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy, respectively. The 5-year biochemical relapse-free survival (bRFS) and overall survival rates in the low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk groups were 97.0%, 91.1%, and 83.1%, and 98.4%, 96.8%, and 95.2%, respectively. In the multivariate analysis, the NCCN classification was a significant prognostic factor for bRFS, but not overall survival. The incidence rates of grade 2 or more severe late gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities were 4.1% and 4.0%, retrospectively. This retrospective analysis of a multi-institutional survey suggested that PT is effective and well-tolerated for prostate cancer.

UV light phototherapy using narrowband UV-B (NB-UVB) and bath-psoralen UV-A (bath-PUVA) therapy are well-established treatments for psoriasis. Dual-action mechanisms of UV phototherapy have been identified: apoptosis and immune suppression. NB-UVB depletes pathogenic T cells by inducing apoptosis and regulatory T cells. Other wavelengths are also utilized for phototherapy, namely 308-nm excimer light and 312-nm flat-typed NB-UVB. Excimer light (308-nm) therapy effectively targets the affected skin without unduly exposing other areas and increases the levels of regulatory T cells. Phototherapy improves impaired resting regulatory T cells and increases activated regulatory T cells in patients with psoriasis. Intensive studies of phototherapy effects have led to several improvements in the design, protocols, and light sources, such as UV light-emitting diodes, thereby providing several options for patients with refractory skin disease, such as psoriasis. ? 2018 Japanese Dermatological Association",apoptosis; excimer light; immune suppression; narrowband ultraviolet B; regulatory T cells,interleukin 17; interleukin 22; interleukin 23; transcription factor FOXP3; dermatological agent; photosensitizing agent; apoptosis; CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte; clinical effectiveness; clinical protocol; excimer filter; excimer light therapy; human; immunosuppressive treatment; lymphocyte proliferation; outcome assessment; phototherapy; process development; psoriasis; radiation exposure; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; T lymphocyte activation; Th17 cell; therapy effect; ultraviolet A radiation; ultraviolet B radiation; ultraviolet phototherapy; cytology; devices; immunology; procedures; psoriasis; radiation response; skin; T lymphocyte; treatment outcome; Apoptosis; Dermatologic Agents; Humans; Photosensitizing Agents; Psoriasis; Skin; T-Lymphocytes; Treatment Outcome; Ultraviolet Therapy,2-s2.0-85041042960

We investigated the possible association of dietary intake of fish and n-3 PUFAs with the risks of maternal and paternal psychological distress during pregnancy and of maternal postpartum depression in Japan. From a dataset comprising 104,102 maternal registrations and 52,426 paternal registrations in The Japan Environment and Children's Study, this study analyzed complete data on questionnaires for 75,139, 79,346, and 77,661 women during early pregnancy, mid-late pregnancy, and after pregnancy, respectively, and for 41,506 male partners. Multivariable logistic regression showed reduced risk of psychological distress in the second and third quintiles for fish intake in early pregnancy and in the second to fifth quintile in mid-late pregnancy. No reductions were observed for n-3 PUFA intake in early pregnancy but in the second to fourth quintile in mid-late pregnancy. For postpartum depression, reductions were observed in the second to fourth quintile for fish intake but only in the first quintile for n-3 PUFA intake. As for paternal psychological distress, only the fourth quintile for fish intake showed a significant reduced risk but none were shown for n-3 PUFA intake. In conclusion, fish intake was associated with some reduced risk of psychological distress during pregnancy, even for male partners. The associations were weaker for n-3 PUFA intake than for fish intake. ? 2017 The Authors",n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids; Postpartum depression; Pregnancy; Psychological distress,"omega 3 fatty acid; omega 3 fatty acid; Article; caloric intake; cohort analysis; dietary intake; distress syndrome; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; female; fish; follow up; human; Japan; Kessler Psychological Distress Scale; male; maternal behavior; paternal behavior; postnatal depression; pregnancy; priority journal; questionnaire; risk factor; scoring system; adult; animal; depression; diet; mental stress; postnatal depression; pregnancy complication; prevention and control; sea food; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Animals; Cohort Studies; Depression, Postpartum; Depressive Disorder; Diet; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Female; Fishes; Humans; Japan; Male; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Seafood; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-85038037471

Methods: A total of 121 Thai patients with HBeAg-negative CHB recruited from a previous randomized trial of 48-week PEG-IFN alone or combined with entecavir were enrolled. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBcrAg levels were serially examined. Paired biopsy samples taken at baseline and after treatment were assessed for intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). Results: Persistent virologic remission (PVR, defined by persistent hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA &lt;2000 IU/mL) and HBsAg clearance at 3 years after treatment were 29% (35/121) and 9% (11/121) respectively. Baseline HBcrAg correlated with HBV DNA and cccDNA but not with HBsAg. Baseline HBsAg, as well as HBsAg and HBcrAg, declines were associated with PVR, while HBsAg decline was predictive of HBsAg clearance. High baseline antigen levels (HBsAg ?3.4 log10 IU/mL plus HBcrAg ?3.7 log10 U/mL) yielded high negative predictive values of PVR (45/50, 90%) and HBsAg clearance (50/50, 100%). At week 12, declines of HBsAg, HBcrAg and both antigens combined of &lt;0.5 log10 yielded negative predictive values for PVR of 90% (71/79), 82% (61/74) and 96% (48/50) respectively. Conclusions: Quantitative HBcrAg was significantly associated with cccDNA in HBeAg-negative CHB. This novel antigen, together with HBsAg, could identify patients with low probability of PVR and HBsAg clearance in long-term follow-up. ? 2017 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases",cccDNA; Chronic hepatitis B; HBcrAg; HBsAg; Hepatitis B core-related antigen; Hepatitis B virus; Pegylated interferon; Predictor; Stopping rule; Treatment response,"alanine aminotransferase; circular DNA; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; peginterferon; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; circular DNA; entecavir; guanine; hepatitis B core antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; virus DNA; adult; antiviral therapy; Article; chronic hepatitis B; combination drug therapy; controlled study; correlational study; female; Hepatitis B virus; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; treatment response; viral clearance; analogs and derivatives; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; chronic hepatitis B; drug monitoring; liver; middle aged; prognosis; serum; virology; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; DNA, Circular; DNA, Viral; Drug Monitoring; Female; Guanine; Hepatitis B Core Antigens; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Serum",2-s2.0-85028984118

PNPLA3 rs738409 has been associated with fibrosis in viral and non-viral hepatitis. TLL1 rs17047200 also has been associated with developing hepatocellular carcinoma probably via hepatic fibrogenesis. We estimated the impact of these genetic polymorphisms on hepatic fibrosis in Japanese patients with NAFLD. Methods: We analyzed the association between these genetic variants and the backgrounds of 817 individuals who received health checkups (health check cohort) from 2012 to 2014. Then, we investigated the relationship between genetic variants and liver histology in 258 consecutive patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD in Japan (NAFLD cohort) from 2012 to 2017 (UMIN000027399). Results: The prevalence of PNPLA3 CG/GG in the NAFLD cohort was higher than that in the health check cohort (p?<?0.001). The prevalence of patients with advanced fibrosis (stages 3–4) was higher for PNPLA3 genotype CG/GG than CC (p?=?0.048) and for TLL1 genotype AT/TT than AA (p?=?0.044). The high-risk group which had at least two risk alleles of these variants was more likely to have advanced fibrosis (p?=?0.004). Multivariate analysis identified body mass index [odds ratio (OR) 1.123, serum AST (OR 1.037, p?=?0.004], serum albumin (OR 0.247, p?=?0.032), and genetic high risk (OR 2.632, p?=?0.026) as predictors of advanced fibrosis. Conclusions: In Japanese patients with NAFLD, individuals with risk alleles of PNPLA3 and TLL1 may have a risk of advanced fibrosis. ? 2017, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Hepatic fibrosis; NAFLD; PNPLA3; TLL1,"alanine aminotransferase; albumin; aspartate aminotransferase; gamma glutamyltransferase; genomic DNA; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; patatin like phospholipase domain containing protein 3; peptides and proteins; phospholipase; serum albumin; tolloid like 1; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; adiponutrin, human; aspartate aminotransferase; membrane protein; serum albumin; TLL1 protein, human; tolloid metalloproteinase; triacylglycerol lipase; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body mass; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; controlled study; coronary risk; disease severity; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; Framingham risk score; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk; genotype; glucose blood level; high risk population; histology; human; Japan; Japanese (people); laboratory test; liver biopsy; liver fibrosis; liver histology; major clinical study; male; nonalcoholic fatty liver; physical examination; priority journal; retrospective study; triacylglycerol blood level; adolescent; blood; complication; genetics; liver cirrhosis; middle aged; multivariate analysis; nonalcoholic fatty liver; nonparametric test; pathology; prevalence; single nucleotide polymorphism; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Female; Genotype; Humans; Japan; Lipase; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Membrane Proteins; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prevalence; Serum Albumin; Statistics, Nonparametric; Tolloid-Like Metalloproteinases; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85025823167

We have reported several sugar-conjugated chlorins that express stronger antitumor effects in PDT than talaporfin sodium (TS), a second-generation photosensitizer clinically used in Japan. In this study, we developed a novel glucose-conjugated chlorin e6 (G-chlorin e6) and evaluated its antitumor effects. Methods: G-chlorin e6 was synthesized with a core photosensitizer chlorin e6 conjugated to glucose. We measured the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) to compare the PDT effects of G-chlorin e6 and TS, and flow cytometry was performed to examine the accumulation of G-chlorin e6 in cancer cells. We also compared the accumulation of G-chlorin e6 between normal immortalized esophageal epithelial cells and esophageal cancer cells. Antitumor effects of G-chlorin e6 PDT were finally analyzed in allograft tumor mouse models. Results: PDT in vitro using G-chlorin e6 elicited 9, 000–34,000 times stronger antitumor effects than TS, and there was 70–190 times more G-chlorin e6 accumulated than TS by flow cytometry. G-chlorin e6 accumulated more selectively in esophageal cancer cells than in esophageal immortalized epithelial cells, and in an allograft model, PDT with G-chlorin e6 showed very strong antitumor effects and a 40% complete response (CR) rate. Conclusions: G-chlorin e6 showed excellent tumor selectivity, and PDT using G-chlorin e6 revealed the strongest anti-tumor effects among all sugar-conjugated chlorins that we have studied. G-chlorin e6 is considered to be the best photosensitizer for next-generation PDT. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Chlorin; Photodynamic therapy; Reactive oxygen species; Talaporfin sodium; Warburg's effect,"methyl 18 ethyl 5 (2 methoxy 2 oxoethyl) 7 (3 methoxy 3 oxopropyl) 2,8,12,17 tetramethyl 13 [1 [3 [(3,4,5 trihydroxy 6 (hydroxymethyl) tetrahydro 2h pyran 2 yl)thio]propoxy]ethyl] 7h,8h porphyrin 3 carboxylic acid; photosensitizing agent; talaporfin; unclassified drug; glucose; photosensitizing agent; phytochlorin; porphyrin; allograft; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer cell; controlled study; dose response; drug accumulation; drug selectivity; drug synthesis; epithelium cell; esophagus cancer; flow cytometry; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; mouse; nonhuman; photodynamic therapy; priority journal; animal; apoptosis; Bagg albino mouse; cell proliferation; drug combination; drug effects; drug potentiation; female; gastrointestinal tumor; pathology; photochemotherapy; procedures; treatment outcome; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Combinations; Drug Synergism; Female; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Glucose; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Porphyrins; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85041927717

This abridged English edition of the J-SSCG 2016 was produced with permission from the Japanese Association of Acute Medicine and the Japanese Society for Intensive Care Medicine. Methods: Members of the Japanese Society of Intensive Care Medicine and the Japanese Association for Acute Medicine were selected and organized into 19 committee members and 52 working group members. The guidelines were prepared in accordance with the Medical Information Network Distribution Service (Minds) creation procedures. The Academic Guidelines Promotion Team was organized to oversee and provide academic support to the respective activities allocated to each Guideline Creation Team. To improve quality assurance and workflow transparency, a mutual peer review system was established, and discussions within each team were open to the public. Public comments were collected once after the initial formulation of a clinical question (CQ) and twice during the review of the final draft. Recommendations were determined to have been adopted after obtaining support from a two-thirds (>66.6%) majority vote of each of the 19 committee members. Results: A total of 87 CQs were selected among 19 clinical areas, including pediatric topics and several other important areas not covered in the first edition of the Japanese guidelines (J-SSCG 2012). The approval rate obtained through committee voting, in addition to ratings of the strengths of the recommendation, and its supporting evidence were also added to each recommendation statement. We conducted meta-analyses for 29 CQs. Thirty-seven CQs contained recommendations in the form of an expert consensus due to insufficient evidence. No recommendations were provided for five CQs. Conclusions: Based on the evidence gathered, we were able to formulate Japanese-specific clinical practice guidelines that are tailored to the Japanese context in a highly transparent manner. These guidelines can easily be used not only by specialists, but also by non-specialists, general clinicians, nurses, pharmacists, clinical engineers, and other healthcare professionals. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Evidence-based medicine; Guidelines; Medical Information Network Distribution Service (Minds); Sepsis; Septic shock; Systematic review,aminoglycoside; antiinfective agent; beta lactam; biological marker; contrast medium; corticosteroid; dobutamine; epinephrine; fludrocortisone; hypertensive agent; immunoglobulin; meropenem; moxifloxacin; noradrenalin; phosphodiesterase III inhibitor; steroid; vasopressin; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacteremia; bacterial endocarditis; blood culture; blood pressure monitoring; bloodstream infection; community care; diet supplementation; echocardiography; fluid resuscitation; glomerulus filtration rate; health care quality; heart function; hemodynamics; hospital pharmacy; human; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; hypothermia; infectious pancreatic necrosis; intensive care; laparotomy; lumbar puncture; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; meta analysis; mortality; multiple organ failure; nephrostomy; practice guideline; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; respiratory distress syndrome; resuscitation; sepsis; septic shock; systematic review; thermoregulation; thrombocyte transfusion; thromboembolism; tidal volume; tissue perfusion; transesophageal echocardiography; urinary tract infection,2-s2.0-85041461970

By using whole-genome sequencing and comparing sequences with those of clones from the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, we clarified the traits of the serotype 15A-ST63 clone. Our analysis revealed that the meropenem-resistant serotype 15A-ST63 strains from Japan originated from meropenem-susceptible strains from Japan. Recombination site prediction analysis showed that the meropenem-resistant strain-specific recombination regions included the pbp1a and pbp2b regions. A detailed analysis of the composition of these genes indicated that resistance seems to be caused by pbp1a recombination. The pbp1a gene in meropenem-resistant isolates was identical to that in multidrug (including meropenem)-resistant serotype 19A-ST320 pneumococci, which have spread in the United States. The global spread of pneumococci of this lineage is noteworthy because serotype 15A is not included in the currently used 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. ? 2018 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

In the era of DAAs, surveillance of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) after eradication of HCV by anti-HCV therapy is particularly important. As is well known, an advanced state of hepatic fibrosis is the major risk factor for developing HCC. Therefore, an increased understanding of various factors associated with disease progression and development of HCC in CHC patients is essential for implementing personalized treatment and surveillance of disease progression and HCC. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified several host genetic variants influencing treatment efficacy or clinical course in HCV infection. This review focuses on these host genetic variations recently identified, mainly by GWAS, which are associated with the clinical course of chronic HCV infection, especially disease progression and hepatocarcinogenesis. ? 2017 The Japan Society of Hepatology",genome-wide association study; hepatic fibrosis; hepatitis C virus; hepatocellular carcinoma; sustained virologic response,epidermal growth factor; interleukin 6; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; monocyte chemotactic protein 2; protein MDM2; protein p53; transforming growth factor beta1; tumor necrosis factor; CCL2 gene; CCL8 gene; chronic hepatitis C; cryoglobulinemia; disease exacerbation; EGF gene; gene; genetic association; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; human; IFNL3 gene; IFNL4 gene; IL6 gene; lichen planus; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell carcinoma; MDM2 gene; PNPLA3 gene; priority journal; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism; TGFB1 gene; TNF gene; TP53 gene,2-s2.0-85040166498

However, despite the abundance of diseases requiring a differential diagnosis from PET, such as superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome, perilymphatic fistula, acute low-tone sensorineural hearing loss, etc., there are currently no established diagnostic criteria for PET. In view of these circumstances, the Japan Otological Society (JOS) Eustachian Tube Committee proposed the diagnostic criteria for Patulous Eustachian Tube in 2012, in order to promote clinical research on PET. A revision was made in 2016, maintaining the original concept that the criteria should be very simple, avoid any contamination of “Definite PET” with uncertain cases. Moreover, it was also intended to minimize the number of cases that could be accidentally excluded even in the presence of some suspected findings (“Possible PET”). The criteria can be used by all otolaryngologists even without using the Eustachian tube function test apparatus. However, the use of such an apparatus may increase the chances of detecting “Definite PET”. The algorithm for the diagnosis of PET using the criteria has also been described. The JOS diagnostic criteria for Patulous Eustachian Tube will further promote international scientific communication on PET. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Acute low-tone sensorineural hearing loss; Adhesive otitis media; Cholesteatoma; Patulous Eustachian Tube; Perilymphatic fistula; Superior semicircular canal dehiscence,"algorithm; Article; auditory tube dysfunction; clinical research; diagnostic criteria; diagnostic test; disease classification; Eustachian tube function test apparatus; human; Japan; medical society; otolaryngologist; patulous eustachian tube; uncertainty; auditory tube; differential diagnosis; ear disease; pathology; pathophysiology; practice guideline; Algorithms; Diagnosis, Differential; Ear Diseases; Eustachian Tube; Humans",2-s2.0-85033803711

Solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is an ideal tool that can investigate biophysical events at the atomic level, in near-physiological buffer solutions, or even inside cells. Scope of review In the past several decades, progress in solution NMR has significantly contributed to the elucidation of three-dimensional structures, the understanding of conformational motions, and the underlying thermodynamic and kinetic properties of biomacromolecules. This review discusses recent methodological development of NMR, their applications and some of the remaining challenges. Major conclusions Although a major drawback of NMR is its difficulty in studying the dynamical ordering of larger biomolecular systems, current technologies have achieved considerable success in the structural analysis of substantially large proteins and biomolecular complexes over 1 MDa and have characterised a wide range of timescales across which biomolecular motion exists. While NMR is well suited to obtain local structure information in detail, it contributes valuable and unique information within hybrid approaches that combine complementary methodologies, including solution scattering and microscopic techniques. General significance For living systems, the dynamic assembly and disassembly of macromolecular complexes is of utmost importance for cellular homeostasis and, if dysregulated, implied in human disease. It is thus instructive for the advancement of the study of the dynamical ordering to discuss the potential possibilities of solution NMR spectroscopy and its applications.

Because only five reports have been published to date, the clinical features associated with SZT2 remain unclear. We herein report an additional patient with biallelic mutations in SZT2. The proband, a four-year-old girl, showed developmental delay and seizures from two years of age. Her seizures were not intractable and readily controlled by valproate. She showed mildly dysmorphic facies with macrocephaly, high forehead, and hypertelorism, and also had pectus carinatum. An EEG showed epileptic discharges which rarely occurred. A brain MRI revealed a short and thick corpus callosum. Whole-exome sequencing detected compound heterozygous biallelic mutations (c.8596dup (p.Tyr2866Leufs?42) and c.2930-17_2930-3delinsCTCGTG) in SZT2, both of which were novel and predicted to be truncating. This case suggested a broad phenotypic spectrum arises from SZT2 mutations, forming a continuum from epileptic encephalopathy and severe developmental delay to mild intellectual disability without epilepsy. The characteristic thick and short corpus callosum observed in 7/8 cases with epilepsy, including the proband, but not in three non-syndromic cases, appears to be specific, and thus useful for indicating the possibility of SZT2 mutations. This feature has the potential to make loss of SZT2 a clinically discernible disorder despite a wide clinical spectrum. ? 2017 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology",Epileptic encephalopathy; Intellectual disability; Seizure; Whole-exome sequencing,"biological marker; seizure threshold 2 protein; unclassified drug; valproic acid; nerve protein; SZT2 protein, human; Article; body dysmorphic disorder; body height; body weight; brain disease; case report; cesarean section; child; clinical article; corpus callosum; developmental delay; electroencephalogram; epilepsy; epileptic discharge; exon; face dysmorphia; female; frameshift mutation; gait disorder; gene frequency; gene loss; gene mutation; genetic variability; gestational age; gesture; head circumference; heterozygote; human; hypertelorism; intellectual impairment; macrocephaly; maternal hypertension; molecular cloning; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pigeon thorax; preschool child; Sanger sequencing; seizure; speech disorder; stop codon; tonic clonic seizure; unconsciousness; whole exome sequencing; Alexander disease; corpus callosum agenesis; developmental disorder; diagnostic imaging; epilepsy; genetics; mutation; pathophysiology; phenotype; Agenesis of Corpus Callosum; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Megalencephaly; Mutation; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Phenotype",2-s2.0-85028819874

Methods: A total of 95 patients with chronic hepatitis B being treated with NUCs were enrolled. Immediately following NUC cessation, peg-IFN was administered at 180??g/dose weekly for 48?weeks. Results: Twenty-six patients (27%) were judged to be responders at 48?weeks after the completion of peg-IFN. Analysis of baseline factors revealed that hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) <3.1?log?IU/ml and HB core-related antigen (HBcrAg) <3.9?log?U/ml were significant indicators of a treatment response. The levels of the markers decreased in both responders and non-responders during peg-IFN therapy but continued falling in responders only after halting peg-IFN. Lower HBsAg (<2.0?log?IU/ml) and HBcrAg (<3.8?log?U/ml) levels at the time of response judgment were also significantly associated with a favorable response. While lower HBcrAg at baseline was the sole predictor of decreased HBcrAg levels at judgment, lower HBsAg, lower HBcrAg, and the use of adefovir dipivoxil at baseline predicted decreased HBsAg levels at the study endpoint. The use of adefovir dipivoxil was also associated with higher serum IFN-λ3, which might have contributed to the reduction in patient HBsAg levels. Conclusions: The combinational use of HBsAg and HBcrAg levels at baseline and their changes throughout sequential therapy may be useful for predicting a response to NUC/peg-IFN sequential therapy. ? 2017, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Anti-viral therapy; Chronic hepatitis; Covalently closed circular DNA; Hepatitis B core-related antigen; Hepatitis B surface antigen,"alanine aminotransferase; hepatitis B core related antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; interleukin 28B; peginterferon; unclassified drug; virus antigen; adefovir dipivoxil; adenine; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; biological marker; hepatitis B core antigen; macrogol; peginterferon alpha2a; phosphonic acid derivative; recombinant protein; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase level; Article; chronic hepatitis B; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug dose reduction; drug withdrawal; epilepsy; female; follow up; human; immunoreactivity; interstitial pneumonia; limit of detection; major clinical study; male; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; prospective study; retina hemorrhage; side effect; signal detection; thyroiditis; treatment duration; treatment response; very elderly; analogs and derivatives; blood; chronic hepatitis B; clinical trial; combination drug therapy; drug administration; drug monitoring; middle aged; multicenter study; procedures; virology; Adenine; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Monitoring; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hepatitis B Core Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Male; Middle Aged; Organophosphonates; Polyethylene Glycols; Prospective Studies; Recombinant Proteins",2-s2.0-85021160666

Several reports of WE in cancer patients are known. WE is sometimes overlooked because most patients do not exhibit its typical symptoms (e.g., delirium, ataxia, ocular palsy). If delirium is not present, a diagnosis of WE is difficult because delirium is the hallmark symptom of WE. Method: Taken from a series on WE in cancer, we report two patients who developed WE without delirium during periodic psycho-oncology outpatient visits. Results: Case 1. A 61-year-old woman with non-Hodgkin lymphoma who was periodically attending a psycho-oncology outpatient clinic developed an unsteady gait. WE was suspected because she also developed appetite loss for two weeks, and we could find no other laboratory findings to explain her unsteady gait. Our diagnosis was supported by abnormal serum thiamine and disappearance of the gait disturbance after intravenous thiamine administration. Case 2. A 50-year-old woman with breast carcinoma with bone metastasis developed an unsteady gait. WE was suspected because she also developed loss of appetite for two weeks, and no other laboratory findings could explain her unsteady gait. The diagnosis was supported by abnormal serum thiamine and disappearance of the gait disturbance after administration of intravenous thiamine. Significance of Results: Our report emphasizes the importance of being aware of WE, even when patients do not present with delirium. The presence of loss of appetite for more than two weeks may be the key to a diagnosis of WE. ?

Thus, we measured IFN-λ 3 levels in patients with HBV and investigated its clinical significance and association with nucleos(t)ide (NUC) analogue administration. Design Serum IFN-λ 3 level was measured in 254 patients with HBV with varying clinical conditions using our own high sensitivity method. The resulting values were compared with various clinical variables. In addition, cell lines originating from various organs were cultured with NUCs, and the production of IFN-λ 3 was evaluated. Results Higher serum IFN-λ 3 levels were detected in the patients treated with nucleotide analogues (adefovir or tenofovir) compared with those treated with nucleoside analogues (lamivudine or entecavir). There were no other differences in the clinical background between the two groups. A rise in the serum IFN-λ 3 levels was observed during additional administration of the nucleotide analogues. In vitro experiments showed that the nucleotide analogues directly and dose-dependently induced IFN-λ 3 production only in colon cancer cells. Furthermore, the supernatant from cultured adefovir-treated colon cancer cells significantly induced IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) and inhibited hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) production in hepatoma cells, as compared with the supernatant from entecavir-treated cells. Conclusions We discovered that the nucleotide analogues show an additional pharmacological effect by inducing IFN-λ 3 production, which further induces ISGs and results in a reduction of HBsAg production. These findings provide novel insights for HBV treatment and suggest IFN-λ 3 induction as a possible target. ? Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Here, we analyze DNMs in 262 ASD probands of Japanese origin and confirm the “de novo paradigm” of ASDs across ethnicities. Based on this consistency, we combine the lists of damaging DNMs in our and published ASD cohorts (total number of trios, 4,244) and perform integrative bioinformatics analyses. Besides replicating the findings of previous studies, our analyses highlight ATP-binding genes and fetal cerebellar/striatal circuits. Analysis of individual genes identified 61 genes enriched for damaging DNMs, including ten genes for which our dataset now contributes to statistical significance. Screening of compounds altering the expression of genes hit by damaging DNMs reveals a global downregulating effect of valproic acid, a known risk factor for ASDs, whereas cardiac glycosides upregulate these genes. Collectively, our integrative approach provides deeper biological and potential medical insights into ASDs. Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are genetically heterogeneous neurodevelopmental conditions. Takata et al. analyze de novo mutations (DNMs) in Japanese ASD probands and confirm that the “de novo paradigm” is applicable across cohorts of different ethnicities.

Our mRNA transcript analyses on the genes involved in synthesizing GlcNAc-6-O-sulfated glycans in human colon cancer tissues indicated that GlcNAc6ST-2 (CHST4) is preferentially expressed in cancer cells compared with nonmalignant epithelial cells among the three known major GlcNAc-6-O-sulfotransferases. On the contrary, GlcNAc6ST-3 (CHST5) was only expressed in nonmalignant epithelial cells, whereas GlcNAc6ST- 1 (CHST2) was expressed equally in both cancerous and nonmalignant epithelial cells. These results suggest that 6-O-sulfated glycans that are synthesized only by GlcNAc6ST-2 may be highly colon cancer-specific, as supported by immunohistochemical staining of cancer cells using the MECA-79 antibody known to be relatively specific to the enzymatic reaction products of GlcNAc6ST-2. By more precise MS-based sulfoglycomic analyses, we sought to further infer the substrate specificities of GlcNAc6STs via a definitive mapping of various sulfo-glycotopes and O-glycan structures expressed in response to overexpression of transfected GlcNAc6STs in the SW480 colon cancer cell line. By detailed MS/MS sequencing, GlcNAc6ST-3 was shown to preferentially add sulfate onto core 2-based O-glycan structures, but it does not act on extended core 1 structures, whereas GlcNAc6ST-1 prefers core 2-based O-glycans to extended core 1 structures. In contrast, GlcNAc6ST-2 could efficiently add sulfate onto both extended core 1- and core 2-basedO-glycans, leading to the production of unique sulfated extended core 1 structures such as R-GlcNAc(6-SO 3 - )β1- 3Galβ1-4GlcNAc(6-SO 3 - )β1-3Galβ1-3GalNAcα, which are good candidates to be targeted as cancer-specific glycans. ? 2018 Yu et al.

The detailed molecular mechanisms, however, remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigated the role of transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7) channels in HG-mediated endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) and injury of NS20Y neuronal cells. The cells were incubated in the absence or presence of HG for 48 h. We found that mRNA and protein levels of TRPM7 and of ERS-associated proteins, such as C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP), 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (GRP78), and inducible nitric-oxide synthase (iNOS), increased in HG-treated cells, along with significantly increased TRPM7-associated currents in these cells. Similar results were obtained in cerebral cortical tissue from an insulin-deficiency model of diabetic mice. Moreover,HGtreatment of cells activated ERS-associated proapoptotic caspase activity and induced cellular injury. Interestingly, a NOS inhibitor, L-NAME, suppressed the HG-induced increase of TRPM7 expression and cellular injury. siRNAmediated TRPM7 knockdown or chemical inhibition of TRPM7 activity also suppressed HG-induced ERS and decreased cleaved caspase-12/caspase-3 levels and cell injury. Of note, TRPM7 overexpression increased ERS and cell injury independently of its kinase activity. Taken together, our findings suggest that TRPM7 channel activities play a key role in HG-associated ERS and cytotoxicity through an apoptosis-inducing signaling cascade involving HG, iNOS, TRPM7, ERS proteins, and caspases. ?2018 The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology,Inc.",,"Cell death; Cell membranes; Glucose; Neurons; Nitric oxide; Channel activity; Chemical inhibition; Endoplasmic reticulum stress; Homologous proteins; Inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); Molecular mechanism; Signaling cascades; Transient receptor potentials; Proteins; caspase; caspase 12; caspase 3; glucose; glucose regulated protein 78; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; inducible nitric oxide synthase; insulin; messenger RNA; n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester; small interfering RNA; transient receptor potential channel M7; caspase; Ddit3 protein, mouse; glucose; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; heat shock protein; inducible nitric oxide synthase; insulin; molecular chaperone GRP78; transient receptor potential channel M; Trpm7 protein, mouse; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; brain cortex; cell damage; controlled study; cytotoxicity; embryo; endoplasmic reticulum stress; enzyme activity; human; human cell; infant; male; mouse; neuroapoptosis; nonhuman; NS20Y cell line; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; animal; apoptosis; brain; C57BL mouse; cytology; endoplasmic reticulum stress; experimental diabetes mellitus; genetics; metabolism; nerve cell; physiology; Animals; Apoptosis; Brain; Caspases; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Glucose; Heat-Shock Proteins; Insulin; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neurons; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type II; Transcription Factor CHOP; TRPM Cation Channels",2-s2.0-85053311158

Little is known about the effect of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection on gut microbiota and the relationship between alteration of gut microbiota and chronic hepatitis C (CHC) progression. We performed a comparative study of gut microbiota composition between CHC patients and healthy individuals. Methods. Fecal samples from 166 CHC patients were compared with those from 23 healthy individuals; the gut microbiota community was analyzed using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. CHC patients were diagnosed with persistently normal serum alanine aminotransferase without evidence of liver cirrhosis (LC) (PNALT, n = 18), chronic hepatitis (CH, n = 84), LC (n = 40), and hepatocellular carcinoma in LC (n = 24). Results. Compared with healthy individuals, bacterial diversity was lower in persons with HCV infection, with a decrease in the order Clostridiales and an increase in Streptococcus and Lactobacillus. Microbiota dysbiosis already appeared in the PNALT stage with the transient increase in Bacteroides and Enterobacteriaceae. Predicted metagenomics of microbial communities showed an increase in the urease gene mainly encoded by viridans streptococci during CHC progression, consistent with a significantly higher fecal pH in CH and LC patients than in healthy individuals or those in the PNALT stage. Conclusions. HCV infection is associated with gut dysbiosis, even in patients with mild liver disease. Additionally, overgrowth of viridans streptococci can account for hyperammonemia in CH and LC. Further studies would help to propose a novel treatment strategy because the gut microbiome can be therapeutically altered, potentially reducing the complications of chronic liver disease. ?

The aim of this study was therefore to clarify the prognostic value of ECG data in FM patients supported by venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA-ECMO). Methods and Results: In this multicenter chart review, we investigated 99 patients with FM supported by VA-ECMO. The final cohort consisted of 87 patients (mean age, 52±16 years; female, 42%) after 12 patients who required conversion to other forms of mechanical circulatory support were excluded. The median LVEF was 14.5%. At the time of VA-ECMO initiation, 38 patients (44%) had arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation (6%), complete atrioventricular block (CAVB; 17%), and ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation (VT/VF; 15%). Of the 49 patients with sinus rhythm (SR), 26 had QRS duration ?120 ms (wide QRS). On logistic regression analysis, wide QRS predicted in-hospital death in patients with SR (OR, 3.6; 95% CI: 1.07–13.61, P=0.04). Compared with SR with narrow QRS (QRS duration <120 ms), CAVB and VT/VF had a higher risk of in-hospital death (CAVB: OR, 7.20; 95% CI: 1.78–34.15, P=0.005; VT/VF: OR, 8.10; 95% CI: 1.86–42.31, P=0.005). Conclusions: In patients with FM, CAVB and VT/VF carried a higher risk of in-hospital death.

A cell-based screening method with a p53-responsive luciferase-reporter assay system revealed that an ethanol extract of Oroxylum indicum bark increased p53 transcriptional activity. Chrysin was isolated and identified as the active ingredient in the O. indicum bark extract. A treatment with chrysin increased p53 protein expression and the p53-mediated expression of downstream target genes, and decreased cell viability in MCF7 cells, but not in p53-knockdown MCF7 cells.

We report the baseline profiles of the participating mothers, fathers, and their children. Methods: Fifteen Regional Centres located throughout Japan were responsible for recruiting women in early pregnancy living in their respective recruitment areas. Self-administered questionnaires and medical records were used to obtain such information as demographic factors, lifestyle, socioeconomic status, environmental exposure, medical history, and delivery information. In the period up to delivery, we collected bio-specimens, including blood, urine, hair, and umbilical cord blood. Fathers were also recruited, when accessible, and asked to fill in a questionnaire and to provide blood samples. Results: The total number of pregnancies resulting in delivery was 100,778, of which 51,402 (51.0%) involved program participation by male partners. Discounting pregnancies by the same woman, the study included 95,248 unique mothers and 49,189 unique fathers. The 100,778 pregnancies involved a total of 101,779 fetuses and resulted in 100,148 live births. The coverage of children in 2013 (the number of live births registered in JECS divided by the number of all live births within the study areas) was approximately 45%.

METHODS Using Sanger sequencing, we sequenced the exomes of six members of a large family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy and confirmed cosegregation in all 37 family members. We screened an additional 310 patients with this disorder for variants on DNA melting-curve analysis and targeted real-time DNA sequencing of the gene encoding intestinal-cell kinase (ICK). We calculated Bayesian logarithm of the odds (LOD) scores for cosegregating variants, odds ratios in case-control associations, and allele frequencies in the Genome Aggregation Database. We performed functional tests of the effects of variants on mitosis, apoptosis, and radial neuroblast migration in vitro and conducted video-EEG studies in mice lacking a copy of Ick. RESULTS A variant, K305T (c.914A→C), cosegregated with epilepsy or polyspikes on EEG in 12 members of the family affected with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. We identified 21 pathogenic ICK variants in 22 of 310 additional patients (7%). Four strongly linked variants (K220E, K305T, A615T, and R632X) impaired mitosis, cell-cycle exit, and radial neuroblast migration while promoting apoptosis. Tonic-clonic convulsions and polyspikes on EEG resembling seizures in human juvenile myoclonic epilepsy occurred more often in knockout heterozygous mice than in wild-type mice (P=0.02) during light sleep with isoflurane anesthesia. CONCLUSIONS Our data provide evidence that heterozygous variants in ICK caused juvenile myoclonic epilepsy in 7% of the patients included in our analysis. Variant ICK affects cell processes that help explain microdysgenesis and polyspike networks observed on EEG in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and others.).

Most of these methods offer good assessment of pulmonary functions, disease progression, and mortality. Each method has merits that can be used in clinical practice. One of the texture classification methods is reported to be superior to visual CT scoring by radiologist for correlation with pulmonary function and prediction of mortality.

WFS1 encodes an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident transmembrane protein, and mutations in this gene lead to pancreatic β-cell death induced by high levels of ER stress. However, the mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration caused by WFS1 deficiency remain elusive. Here, we investigated the role of WFS1 in the maintenance of neuronal integrity in vivo by knocking down the expression of wfs1, the Drosophila homolog of WFS1, in the central nervous system. Neuronal knockdown of wfs1 caused age-dependent behavioral deficits and neurodegeneration in the fly brain. Knockdown of wfs1 in neurons and glial cells resulted in premature death and significantly exacerbated behavioral deficits in flies, suggesting that wfs1 has important functions in both cell types. Although wfs1 knockdown alone did not promote ER stress, it increased the susceptibility to oxidative stress-, excitotoxicity- or tauopathy-induced behavioral deficits, and neurodegeneration. The glutamate release inhibitor riluzole significantly suppressed premature death phenotypes induced by neuronal and glial knockdown of wfs1. This study highlights the protective role of wfs1 against age-associated neurodegeneration and furthers our understanding of potential disease-modifying factors that determine susceptibility and resilience to age-associated neurodegenerative diseases. ? 2018 Sakakibara et al.",,"excitatory amino acid transporter 1; membrane protein; messenger RNA; riluzole; unclassified drug; Wolfram syndrome 1 protein; membrane protein; wolframin protein; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; cell vacuole; cellular distribution; controlled study; disease predisposition; down regulation; Drosophila; Eaat1 gene; excitotoxicity; exon; female; gene; gene expression; gene interaction; gene knockdown; gene mutation; genetic model; glia cell; heterozygosity; in vivo study; lifespan; male; mRNA expression level; mutant; nerve cell degeneration; nerve cell necrosis; nerve fiber degeneration; nonhuman; Opa1 gene; oxidative stress; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA interference; start codon; tauopathy; WFS1 gene; aging; animal; cell culture; complication; Drosophila melanogaster; gene knockdown; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; mental disease; mental stress; metabolism; nerve cell; nerve degeneration; nervous system; pathology; pathophysiology; sequence homology; transgenic animal; Wolfram syndrome; Aging; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Cells, Cultured; Drosophila melanogaster; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Mental Disorders; Nerve Degeneration; Nervous System; Neurons; Sequence Homology; Stress, Psychological; Wolfram Syndrome",2-s2.0-85041670070

We investigated the PD-L1 expression in thymic carcinomas using these four diagnostic assays. The cases of 53 patients were reviewed and their specimens were subjected to four PD-L1 assays with different antibodies (SP142, SP263, 22C3, and 28-8). The PD-L1 expression in tumor cells (TCs) and immune cells (ICs) was evaluated. In TCs, the four assays showed similar scores in each case. Histopathologically, high TC scores were observed in squamous cell carcinomas (SqCCs). Meanwhile, there were no significant relationships among the IC scores in the four assays. In SqCCs, the high expression of PD-L1 (defined as ?50% TC score) in TCs tended to be associated with early stage cancer. The patients with high expression levels of PD-L1 tended to show longer overall survival in the 22C3 assays (p=0.0200). In thymic carcinomas, the staining pattern showed high concordance among the four assays when TCs - rather than ICs - were stained. High PD-L1 positivity in TCs, especially in SqCCs, indicated that PD-1/PD-L1 targeted therapy may be a promising therapeutic approach. ?

Results A total of 741 AL amyloidosis patients were included in this study (436 men and 305 women; median age: 65 years old, range: 31-93). The most frequently affected organ was the kidneys (n=542), followed by the heart (n=252), gastrointestinal (GI) tract (n=164), autonomic nervous system (n=131), liver (n=71), and peripheral nervous system (n=71). Diagnostic findings were most commonly detected in the GI tract (up-per GI tract: 350 cases, lower GI tract: 167 cases), followed by the bone marrow and kidneys. An abdominal fat-pad biopsy was only conducted in 128 patients. Autologous stem cell transplants (ASCTs) and bortezomib were used to treat 126 and 276 patients, respectively. Conclusion The clinical features of Japanese patients with systemic AL amyloidosis are similar to those reported previously for cases in the US and Europe.

Thus, clarification of the molecular mechanism underlying Aβ assembly is crucial not only for understanding the pathogenesis of AD, but also for developing disease-modifying remedies. In 1995, ganglioside-bound Aβ (GAβ), with unique molecular characteristics, including its altered immunoreactivity and its conspicuous ability to accelerate Aβ assembly, was discovered in an autopsied brain showing early pathological changes of AD. Based on these findings, it was hypothesized that GAβ is an endogenous seed for amyloid fibril formation in the AD brain. A body of evidence that supports the GAβ hypothesis has been growing for over 20 years as follows. First, the conformational changes of Aβ from a random coil to an α-helix, and then to a β-sheet in the presence of ganglioside were validated by several techniques. Second, the seed activity of GAβ to accelerate the assembly of soluble Aβ into amyloid fibrils was confirmed by various in vitro and in vivo experiments. Third, it was found that the Aβ binding to ganglioside to form GAβ occurs under limited conditions, which were provided by the lipid environment surrounding ganglioside. Fourth, the region-specific Aβ deposition in the brain appeared to be dependent on the presence of the lipid environment that was in favor of GAβ generation. In this chapter, further progress of the study of ganglioside-mediated Aβ assembly, especially from the aspects of physicochemistry, structural biology, and neuropathology, is reviewed. ? 2017",Alzheimer's disease; amyloid β-protein; ganglioside; ganglioside-bound Aβ,amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; apolipoprotein E; ganglioside; amyloid; amyloid beta protein; ganglioside; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; conformational transition; cytotoxicity; diabetes mellitus; endosome; genotype; human; lipid membrane; lysosome; molecular recognition; nerve cell; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; physical chemistry; protein assembly; protein lipid interaction; protein targeting; risk factor; Alzheimer disease; animal; cell membrane; metabolism; pathophysiology; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Cell Membrane; Gangliosides; Humans,2-s2.0-85040723483

Methods: Between April, 2014 and March, 2015, the authors contacted 47 clinical specialists in male infertility who had been certified by the Japan Society for Reproductive Medicine. The participating clinicians were sent a questionnaire regarding information on their infertile patients, according to etiology and the number and success rates of male infertility operations that had been performed in their practice. Results: Thirty-nine specialists returned the questionnaire and provided information regarding 7268 patients. The etiology of infertility included testicular factors, sexual disorders, and seminal tract obstruction. During the study year, the clinicians performed varicocelectomies, testicular sperm extractions (TESEs), and re-anastomoses of the seminal tract. The rate of successful varicocelectomies was >70%. The sperm retrieval rates with conventional TESE and microdissection TESE were 98.3% and 34.0%, respectively, while the patency rates with vasovasostomy and epididymovasostomy were 81.8% and 61.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Surgical outcomes for infertile male patients are favorable and can be of great clinical benefit for infertile couples.

Although these drugs have revolutionized clinical management of DR, their limited efficacy and adverse effects have raised an increasing demand for new drug development. Meanwhile, mouse retinas have been prevalently employed as an experimental model system for angiogenic research, which has greatly contributed to the understanding of general principles in vascular biology.

How the inflammasome is activated in this untreatable disease is largely unknown. Here we demonstrate that RPE degeneration in human-cell-culture and mouse models is driven by a noncanonical-inflammasome pathway that activates caspase-4 (caspase-11 in mice) and caspase-1, and requires cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)-dependent interferon-β production and gasdermin D-dependent interleukin-18 secretion. Decreased DICER1 levels or Alu-RNA accumulation triggers cytosolic escape of mitochondrial DNA, which engages cGAS. Moreover, caspase-4, gasdermin D, interferon-β, and cGAS levels were elevated in the RPE in human eyes with geographic atrophy. Collectively, these data highlight an unexpected role of cGAS in responding to mobile-element transcripts, reveal cGAS-driven interferon signaling as a conduit for mitochondrial-damage-induced inflammasome activation, expand the immune-sensing repertoire of cGAS and caspase-4 to noninfectious human disease, and identify new potential targets for treatment of a major cause of blindness. ? 2018 Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

We investigated the gene alterations and the immunoexpression of crucial oncogenic molecules in 151 SDCs. The mutation rates that were identified, in order of frequency, were as follows: TP53, 68%; PIK3CA, 18%; H-RAS, 16%; BRAF, 4%; and AKT1, 1.5%. PIK3CA/H-RAS/BRAF mutations were more common in de novo SDC than in SDC ex-pleomorphic adenoma. Furthermore, these mutations were mutually exclusive for HER2 overexpression/amplification. TP53 mutations were frequently detected in cases with the aberrant p53 expression, and TP53 missense and truncating mutations were associated with p53-extreme positivity and negativity, respectively. DISH analysis revealed no cases of EGFR amplification. The rates of PI3K, p-Akt, and p-mTOR positivity were 34%, 22%, and 66%, respectively; PTEN loss was observed in 47% of the cases. These expressions were correlated according to the signaling axis. Cases with PI3K negativity and PTEN loss appeared to show a lower expression of androgen receptor. In the multivariate analysis, patients with SDC harboring TP53 truncating mutations showed shorter progression-free survival. Conversely, p-Akt positivity was associated with a favorable outcome. This study might provide information that leads to advances in personized therapy for SDC. ?

Diabetic macular edema (DME) is one of the main causes of vision disturbance in diabetic retinopathy, which is a clinically significant microvascular complication of diabetes. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is becoming the mainstay of treatment for DME. However, to achieve sustained long-term improvement in visual acuity, conventional laser photocoagulation, vitrectomy and steroid therapy are also expected to play a role in the treatment of DME. This review summarizes the epidemiology and pathology of diabetic retinopathy and DME, evaluates the findings regarding the diagnosis and treatment of DME, and underscores the importance of systemic management of the disease in the context of the current health care situation in Japan. Finally, the unmet needs of patients with DME and prospects for research are discussed.

The purpose of the present study was to determine the clinical significance of Trp catabolism in newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) patients. We quantified serum Trp and Kyn in 52 HL patients, and analyzed their associations with different clinical parameters including serum soluble CD30 concentration. The IDO expression was evaluated in the patients’ affected lymph nodes. The cohort comprised 22 male and 30 female patients (age range, 15-81?years; median, 45?years), with a 5-year overall survival (OS) of 88.6%. The OS was significantly shorter for patients with a high Kyn/Trp ratio (OS at 5?years, 60.0% vs 92.2%), for those with stage IV disease, and for those with lymphocytopenia (&lt;600/mm3 and/or &lt;8% white blood cell count). The latter two parameters are components of the international prognostic score for advanced HL. In contrast, there were no significant differences in OS according to age, serum albumin, hemoglobin, sex, white blood cell count, or serum soluble CD30 (? or &lt;285.6?ng/mL). Multivariate analysis using the three variables stage, lymphocytopenia, and serum Kyn/Trp ratio showed that only the latter significantly affected OS. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 was produced by macrophages/dendritic cells, but not by HL tumor cells, and IDO levels determined by immunohistochemistry had a significant positive correlation with the serum Kyn/Trp ratio. In conclusion, quantification of serum Kyn and Trp is useful for predicting prognosis of individual HL patients. ? 2017 The Authors.

However, little is known regarding the effects of xanthohumol in pancreatic cancer. We have previously reported that activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) plays a key role in angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer. In this study, we investigated whether xanthohumol inhibited angiogenesis by blocking NF-κB activation in pancreatic cancer in?vitro and in?vivo. We initially confirmed that xanthohumol significantly inhibited proliferation and NF-κB activation in pancreatic cancer cell lines. Next, we demonstrated that xanthohumol significantly suppressed the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8) at both the mRNA and protein levels in pancreatic cancer cell lines. We also found that coculture with BxPC-3 cells significantly enhanced tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and treatment with xanthohumol significantly blocked this effect. In vivo, the volume of BxPC-3 subcutaneous xenograft tumors was significantly reduced in mice treated with weekly intraperitoneal injections of xanthohumol. Immunohistochemistry revealed that xanthohumol inhibited Ki-67 expression, CD31-positive microvessel density, NF-κB p65 expression, and VEGF and IL-8 levels. Taken together, these results showed, for the first time, that xanthohumol inhibited angiogenesis by suppressing NF-κB activity in pancreatic cancer. Accordingly, xanthohumol may represent a novel therapeutic agent for the management of pancreatic cancer. ? 2017 The Authors.

Recently, clinical trial and real-world, small-scale studies have reported excellent responses to direct-acting antivirals in patients with advanced chronic kidney diseases. However, real-world, large-scale data were lacking. This large multicenter analysis included HCV-infected hemodialysis patients receiving combination therapy with a nonstructural protein 5A (NS5A) inhibitor, daclatasvir (DCV), and a protease inhibitor, asunaprevir (ASV). Methods: Twenty-three centers in Japan participated in this study of 123 hemodialysis patients with genotype 1 HCV infection, who received DCV/ASV combination therapy between November 2014 and March 2016. We collected and analyzed data relating to treatment outcome, baseline clinical information, laboratory measurements (during and after the treatment), and adverse events. Results: Thirty-nine patients (31.7%) had advanced liver fibrosis, 12 (9.8%) had histories of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and 18 (14.6%) had baseline resistance-associated variants (RAVs) of NS5A. The overall sustained virological response (SVR)12 rate was 95.9% (118/123). Notably, all patients with HCC and 94.4% (17/18) of those with NS5A RAVs achieved SVR12. Significant factors associated with non-SVR were advanced fibrosis and the interleukin-28B non-TT genotype at rs8099917. Four patients (3.3%) discontinued therapy because of adverse events including elevated serum alanine transaminase levels (n?=?2), rash (n?=?1), and HCC (n?=?1); all of these achieved SVR12. Conclusions: This real-world, nationwide study revealed that DCV/ASV combination therapy was safe and highly effective for hemodialysis patients with genotype 1 HCV infections.

Methods: The sample included a total of 1604 preschoolers aged 5 years at Time 1 and first graders aged 6 years at Time 2 (51.5% male). Parents completed a self-reported questionnaire regarding their SES, marital conflict, parenting practices, and their children's behavioral adjustment. Teachers also evaluated the children's social competence. Results: The path analysis results revealed that Time 1 family income and maternal and paternal education levels were respectively related to Time 1 social skills and Time 2 internalizing and externalizing problems, both directly and indirectly, through their influence on destructive and constructive marital conflict, as well as negative and positive parenting practices. Notably, after controlling for Time 1 behavioral problems as mediating mechanisms in the link between family factors (i.e., SES, marital conflict, and parenting practices) and behavioral adjustment, Time 1 social skills significantly and inversely influenced both the internalization and externalization of problems at Time 2. Conclusions: The merit of examining SES, marital conflict, and parenting practices as multidimensional constructs is discussed in relation to an understanding of processes and pathways within families that affect child mental health functioning. The results suggest social competence, which is influenced by the multidimensional constructs of family factors, may prove protective in reducing the risk of child maladjustment, especially for children who are socioeconomically disadvantaged. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Behavioral problems; Marital conflict; Parenting practice; Preschool children; Social competence; Socioeconomic status,adjustment; adolescent; Article; child; child behavior; family conflict; family income; family life; female; human; longitudinal study; male; parental behavior; preschool; preschool child; primary school; priority journal; problem solving; questionnaire; school; social competence; social status; socioeconomics; teacher,2-s2.0-85038351679

Recently, it has been suggested that bacterial infections may contribute to the onset and the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). However, we do not have any evidence about a causative relationship between periodontitis and AD. In this study, we investigated by using a transgenic mouse model of AD whether periodontitis evoked by P. gingivalis modulates the pathological features of AD. Cognitive function was significantly impaired in periodontitis-induced APP-Tg mice, compared to that in control APP-Tg mice. Levels of Amiloid β (Aβ) deposition, Aβ40, and Aβ42 in both the hippocampus and cortex were higher in inoculated APP-Tg mice than in control APP-Tg mice. Furthermore, levels of IL-1β and TNF-α in the brain were higher in inoculated mice than in control mice. The levels of LPS were increased in the serum and brain of P. gingivalis-inoculated mice.

Methods: The purposes of this study were to investigate the patients' perceived needs and the association with psychological distress and/or quality of life, and to clarify the characteristics of patients with a high degree of unmet needs. Ambulatory colorectal cancer patients who were receiving chemotherapy were asked to complete the Short-Form Supportive Care Needs Survey questionnaire, which covers five domains of need (health system and information, psychological, physical, care and support, and sexuality needs), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. Results: Complete data were available for 100 patients. Almost all of the top 10 most common unmet needs belonged to the psychological domain. The patients' total needs were significantly associated with both psychological distress (r = 0.65, P < 0.001) and quality of life (r = -0.38, P < 0.001). A multiple regression analysis revealed that the female gender was significantly associated with higher total needs. Conclusions: The moderate to strong associations that exist between patients' needs and psychological distress and/or quality of life suggest that interventions that respond to patients' needs may be one possible strategy for ameliorating psychological distress and enhancing quality of life. Female patients' needs should be evaluated more carefully. ? The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

However, the strategy of HBV to escape from the host immune system remains largely unknown. In this study, we examined extracellular vesicles (EVs) secreted from human hepatocytes infected with HBV. EVs includeing exosomes are nano-size vesicles with proteins, mRNAs, and microRNAs (miRNAs), which can be transmitted to different cells. We found that 104 EV associated miRNAs were increased in hepatocytes more than 2-fold by HBV infection. We then selected those that were potentially implicated in immune regulation. Among them, five HBV-induced miRNAs were found to potentially target multiple sequences in the 3′UTR of IL-21, a cytokine that induces anti-viral immunity. Moreover, expression of a reporter gene with the 3′ UTR of human IL-21 mRNA was suppressed by the five miRNAs individually. Finally, IL-21 expression in cloned human T cells was down-regulated by the five miRNAs. Collectively, this study identified the novel 3′ UTR sequences of human IL-21 mRNA and potential binding sites of HBV-induced EV-miRNAs. ? 2017, The Author(s).",,"interleukin 21; interleukin derivative; messenger RNA; microRNA; 3' untranslated region; cell culture; chemistry; exosome; genetics; HEK293 cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; human; metabolism; 3' Untranslated Regions; Cells, Cultured; Extracellular Vesicles; HEK293 Cells; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Interleukins; MicroRNAs; RNA, Messenger",2-s2.0-85038398819

However, the mechanisms underlying endothelial dysfunction in testosterone deficiency remain unclear. Aim To investigate the mechanism of endothelial dysfunction in a rat model of testosterone deficiency. Methods Rats were distributed into 3 groups: castrated (Cast), castrated and supplemented with testosterone (Cast + T), and sham (Sham). In the Cast + T group, castrated rats were treated daily with subcutaneous testosterone (3 mg/kg daily) for 4 weeks; Sham and Cast rats received only the vehicle. Outcomes Erectile function using intracavernosal pressure and mean arterial pressure measurements after electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve, endothelial function using isometric tension, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) levels using ultra-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry, and inflammatory biomarker expression were performed 4 weeks after the operation. Results In the Cast group, the ratio of intracavernosal pressure to mean arterial pressure significantly decreased, acetylcholine-induced relaxation was lower, and serum ADMA, oxidative stress, and inflammation biomarker levels were significantly increased (P <.01). Testosterone injection significantly improved each of these parameters (P <.01). Clinical Translation The present results provide scientific evidence of the effect of testosterone deficiency on erectile function and the effect of testosterone replacement therapy. Strengths and Limitations This study provides evidence of the influence of testosterone deficiency on endothelial function by investigating ADMA and oxidative stress. A major limitation of this study is the lack of a direct link of increased ADMA by oxidative stress to inflammation. Conclusion Testosterone deficiency increased not only ADMA levels but also oxidative stress and inflammation in castrated rats, which can cause damage to the corpus cavernosum, resulting in erectile dysfunction.

The efferocytosis defect in Mafb-deficient macrophages can be rescued by adding serum from wild-type mice, but not by adding serum from C1q-deficient mice. By hemolysis assay we also show that activation of the classical complement pathway is decreased in Mafb-deficient mice. In addition, MafB overexpression induces C1q-dependent gene expression and signals that induce C1q genes are less effective in the absence of MafB. We also show that Mafb-deficiency can increase glomerular autoimmunity, including anti-nuclear antibody deposition.

Gut dysbiosis, an imbalance of gut microbiota, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, but its mechanisms are unknown. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main fermentation products of gut microbiota and a link between the gut microbiota and the host's physiology. Here, we investigated a correlation among gut dysbiosis, SCFAs, and metabolic syndrome in TSOD mice. We detected enriched levels of Gram-positive bacteria and corresponding decreases in Gram-negative bacteria in 24-wk-old metabolic syndrome-affected TSOD mice compared with age-matched controls. The abundance of Bacteroidetes species decreased, the abundance of Firmicutes species increased, and nine genera of bacteria were altered in 24-wk-old TSOD mice. The total plasma SCFA level was significantly lower in the TSOD mice than in controls. The major plasma SCFA - acetate - decreased in TSOD mice, whereas propionate and butyrate increased. TSOD mice had no minor SCFAs (valerate and hexanoate) but normal mice did. We thus concluded that gut dysbiosis and consequent disruptions in plasma SCFA profiles occurred in metabolic syndrome-affected TSOD mice. We also propose that the TSOD mouse is a useful model to study gut dysbiosis, SCFAs, and metabolic syndrome. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"volatile fatty acid; animal; Bacteroidetes; blood; diabetes mellitus; disease model; dysbiosis; genetics; human; intestine flora; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; microbiology; mouse; mouse mutant; obesity; pathology; Animals; Bacteroidetes; Diabetes Mellitus; Disease Models, Animal; Dysbiosis; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome; Mice; Mice, Obese; Obesity",2-s2.0-85034657063

Lack of compliance can affect trial outcome. Clinical trial QA groups have different methods of dose distribution verification and analysis, all with the ultimate aim of ensuring trial compliance. The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of different processes to inform future dosimetry audit reciprocity. Materials Six clinical trial QA groups participated. Intensity modulated treatment plans were generated for three different cases. A range of 17 virtual ‘measurements’ were generated by introducing a variety of simulated perturbations (such as MLC position deviations, dose differences, gantry rotation errors, Gaussian noise) to three different treatment plan cases. Participants were blinded to the ‘measured’ data details. Each group analysed the datasets using their own gamma index (γ) technique and using standardised parameters for passing criteria, lower dose threshold, γ normalisation and global γ. Results For the same virtual ‘measured’ datasets, different results were observed using local techniques. For the standardised γ differences in the percentage of points passing with γ < 1 were also found, however these differences were less pronounced than for each clinical trial QA group's analysis. These variations may be due to different software implementations of γ. Conclusions This virtual dosimetry audit has been an informative step in understanding differences in the verification of measured dose distributions between different clinical trial QA groups. This work lays the foundations for audit reciprocity between groups, particularly with more clinical trials being open to international recruitment. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Audit; Audit reciprocity; Gamma index; QA; Radiotherapy clinical trials,"Article; clinical audit; clinical trial (topic); dosimetry; gamma radiation; intensity modulated radiation therapy; priority journal; quality control; software; virtual reality; volumetric modulated arc therapy; health care quality; human; procedures; radiotherapy dosage; standards; Clinical Trials as Topic; Gamma Rays; Humans; Medical Audit; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Radiotherapy Dosage",2-s2.0-85033723058

Our previous observational study suggested that vitamin K antagonist (VKA) promotes aortic valve degeneration, a principal cause of aortic stenosis in the elderly, and that angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) attenuates its progression. This study aimed to prospectively investigate these observations in non-valvular AF patients. Methods Of enrolled 430 patients with calcification on no or one aortic valve leaflet, all of the planned 4-year follow-up data were obtained in 122 non-valvular AF patients treated with warfarin (warfarin group) and 101 patients with cardiovascular diseases and without AF and prescription of warfarin (non-warfarin group). Results Despite higher atherosclerotic risks in the non-warfarin group, 2 or 3 newly calcified leaflets emerged during 4 years in 18.0% of patients in the warfarin group and in 6.9% in the non-warfarin group (p = 0.014). Aortic valve area (AVA) did not significantly change in the non-warfarin group during the follow-up, but tended to decrease in the warfarin group (p = 0.057). Non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant got available in Japan after this study started, and warfarin was discontinued in 15 patients of the warfarin group. The reduction of AVA was significant in the remaining 107 patients on the continuous warfarin treatment (p = 0.002). The effects of ARB on AVA were obscure. Conclusion Major bleeding associated with VKA is well recognized. This study suggests that the development of aortic valve degeneration is another risk of long-term use of VKA in non-valvular AF patients with no or mild aortic valve degeneration. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Anticoagulation; Aortic stenosis; Atrial fibrillation; Vitamin K antagonist,anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; warfarin; vitamin K group; aged; aorta valve degeneration; aortic atherosclerosis; aortic valve disease; Article; atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular disease; comorbidity; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; Doppler echocardiography; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; dyslipidemia; female; follow up; human; hypertension; Japan; major clinical study; male; observational study; prescription; priority journal; prospective study; antagonists and inhibitors; aortic valve; atrial fibrillation; drug effect; echocardiography; procedures; time factor; Aged; Aortic Valve; Atrial Fibrillation; Echocardiography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Prospective Studies; Time Factors; Vitamin K,2-s2.0-85032824427

Abnormal accumulation of TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of affected neurons is a pathological hallmark of the neurodegenerative diseases frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Several transgenic mouse models have been generated that recapitulate defects in TDP-43 accumulation, thus causing neurodegeneration and behavioural impairments. While aging is the key risk factor for neurodegenerative diseases, the specific effect of aging on phenotypes in TDP-43 transgenic mice has not been investigated. Here, we analyse age-dependent changes in TDP-43 transgenic mice that displayed impaired memory. We found the accumulation of abundant poly-ubiquitinated protein aggregates in the hippocampus of aged TDP-43 transgenic mice. Intriguingly, the aggregates contained some interneuron-specific proteins such as parvalbumin and calretinin, suggesting that GABAergic interneurons were degenerated in these mice. The abundance of aggregates significantly increased with age and with the overexpression of TDP-43. Gene array analyses in the hippocampus and other brain areas revealed dysregulation in genes linked to oxidative stress and neuronal function in TDP-43 transgenic mice. Our results indicate that the interneuron degeneration occurs upon aging, and TDP-43 accelerates age-dependent neuronal degeneration, which may be related to the impaired memory of TDP-43 transgenic mice. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"DNA binding protein; protein aggregate; TDP-43 protein, human; age; aging; animal; brain; C57BL mouse; cell death; cytology; disease model; female; gene expression; genetics; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; interneuron; male; memory disorder; metabolism; pathology; transgenic mouse; ubiquitination; Age Factors; Aging; Animals; Brain; Cell Death; Disease Models, Animal; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gene Expression; Interneurons; Male; Memory Disorders; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred ICR; Mice, Transgenic; Protein Aggregates; Ubiquitination",2-s2.0-85032793285

Japan is the most endemic country for HTLV-1 and ATL in the world. Recent nationwide studies of Japanese blood donors reported that HTLV-1 carriers spread from endemic areas to non-endemic areas. Therefore, the latest information on nationwide epidemiological and clinical data for ATL is necessary to guide clinical practice. We undertook a multicenter, hospital-based survey of newly diagnosed ATL patients from 2010 to 2011. A total of 996 patients with ATL were registered from 126 hospitals across Japan. Of those, 922 (487 men and 435 women) were included in the analysis. The median age at diagnosis was 68 years (interquartile range, 60–75 years). Overall, 67.2% of ATL was diagnosed in the Kyushu–Okinawa area. The most common subtype was acute (49.5%), followed by lymphoma (25.7%), chronic (14.2%), and smoldering (10.6%). Lymphoma type was more prevalent in men (60%), whereas chronic was more prevalent in women (60%). Half of patients with lymphoma type were aged over 70 years, whereas one-third of patients with the chronic type were aged under 60 years. All of these characteristics were different from those of the previous nationwide surveys in the 1980s and 1990s. This survey clarified that half of current patients with ATL are aged over 68 years who were unable to receive intensive cytotoxic therapies. New less toxic agents for aged patients and further strategies to prevent the development of ATL from HTLV-1 carrier status are needed. ? 2017 The Authors.

The virus-host interaction mechanisms for achieving an optimal hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication have been largely unknown. Here, a single cell cloning revealed that HepAD38 cells, a widely-used HBV-inducible cell line, contain cell clones with diverse permissiveness to HBV replication. The HBV permissiveness was impaired upon treatment with microtubule inhibitor nocodazole, which was identified as an HBV replication inhibitor from a pharmacological screening. In the microtubule-disrupted cells, the efficiency of HBV capsid assembly was remarkably decreased without significant change in pre-assembly process. We further found that HBV core interacted with tubulin and co-localized with microtubule-like fibriforms, but this association was abrogated upon microtubule-disassembly agents, resulting in attenuation of capsid formation. Our data thus suggest a significant role of microtubules in the efficient capsid formation during HBV replication. In line with this, a highly HBV permissive cell clone of HepAD38 cells showed a prominent association of core-microtubule and thus a high capacity to support the capsid formation. These findings provide a new aspect of virus-cell interaction for rendering efficient HBV replication. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"capsid protein; protein binding; tubulin; tubulin modulator; virus RNA; cell culture; cell line; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; host pathogen interaction; human; metabolism; microtubule; molecular cloning; physiology; virology; virus assembly; virus genome; Capsid Proteins; Cell Line; Cells, Cultured; Cloning, Molecular; Genome, Viral; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Microtubules; Protein Binding; RNA, Viral; Tubulin; Tubulin Modulators; Virus Assembly",2-s2.0-85028951137

A subset of tumor cells with stem-like properties, termed GBM stem-like cells (GSCs), are considered to play a role in tumor relapse. Although oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) is a promising therapeutic for GBM, its efficacy against recurrent GBM is incompletely characterized. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) plays vital roles in maintaining GSC stemness and GBM pathogenesis. We hypothesized that oHSV and TGF-β inhibitors would synergistically exert antitumor effects for recurrent GBM. Here we established a panel of patient-derived recurrent tumor models from GBMs that relapsed after postsurgical radiation and chemotherapy, based on GSC-enriched tumor sphere cultures. These GSCs are resistant to the standard-of-care temozolomide but susceptible to oHSVs G47Δ and MG18L. Inhibition of TGF-β receptor kinase with selective targeted small molecules reduced clonogenic sphere formation in all tested recurrent GSCs. The combination of oHSV and TGF-βR inhibitor was synergistic in killing recurrent GSCs through, in part, an inhibitor-induced JNK-MAPK blockade and increase in oHSV replication. In vivo, systemic treatment with TGF-βR inhibitor greatly enhanced the antitumor effects of single intratumoral oHSV injections, resulting in cures in 60% of mice bearing orthotopic recurrent GBM. These results reveal a novel synergistic interaction of oHSV therapy and TGF-β signaling blockade, and warrant further investigations aimed at clinical translation of this combination strategy for GBM patients. ? 2017 UICC",JNK; oncolytic HSV; recurrent glioblastoma; TGF-β,"4 [4 (1,3 benzodioxol 5 yl) 5 (2 pyridinyl) 1h imidazol 2 yl]benzamide; galunisertib; mitogen activated protein kinase; oncolytic herpes virus; phosphotransferase; stress activated protein kinase; temozolomide; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta receptor kinase; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; transforming growth factor beta; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; antineoplastic activity; Article; cell killing; cell spreading; cell viability; clonogenesis; controlled study; drug efficacy; enzyme inhibition; female; glioblastoma; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; TGF beta signaling; tumor xenograft; virus replication; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; brain tumor; cancer stem cell; drug effects; drug screening; glioblastoma; immunohistochemistry; oncolytic virotherapy; pathology; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; SCID mouse; signal transduction; Simplexvirus; Western blotting; Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Blotting, Western; Brain Neoplasms; Glioblastoma; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Mice; Mice, SCID; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Oncolytic Virotherapy; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Signal Transduction; Simplexvirus; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85028356816

In the development of hPSC-derived CTPs, it is imperative to ensure that they do not form tumors after transplantation for safety reasons. Because cellular immortalization is a landmark of malignant transformation and a common feature of cancer cells, we aimed to develop an in vitro assay for detecting immortalized cells in CTPs. We employed retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells as a model of hPSC-derived products and identified a gene encoding slow skeletal muscle troponin T (TNNT1) as a novel marker of immortalized RPE cells by comprehensive microarray analysis. TNNT1 mRNA was commonly upregulated in immortalized RPE cells and human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), which have self-renewal ability. Additionally, we demonstrated that TNNT1 mRNA expression is higher in several cancer tissues than in normal tissues. Furthermore, stable expression of TNNT1 in ARPE-19 cells affected actin filament organization and enhanced their migration ability. Finally, we established a simple and rapid qRT-PCR assay targeting TNNT1 transcripts that detected as low as 3% of ARPE-19 cells contained in normal primary RPE cells. Purified hiPSC-derived RPE cells showed TNNT1 expression levels below the detection limit determined with primary RPE cells. Our qRT-PCR method is expected to greatly contribute to process validation and quality control of CTPs. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"actin; biological marker; troponin T; cell cycle; cell motion; epithelium cell; gene expression; gene expression profiling; genetics; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; metabolism; protein multimerization; retinal pigment epithelium; transformed cell line; Actins; Biomarkers; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Movement; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Protein Multimerization; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Troponin T",2-s2.0-85027527725

We assessed efficacy of selective depletion of myeloid lineage leukocytes in patients with PsA in a multicenter setting. A total of 20 patients with moderate to severe PsA refractory to conventional and biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs were included. Eligible patients had 3 points or more in the classification criteria for PsA. Each patient received five sessions, once a week, of adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA) with the Adacolumn?. The primary efficacy outcome was 20% or more decrease in the American College of Rheumatology score 20 (ACR20). Partial responders could receive an additional five GMA sessions. Of 20 patients, two did not complete the study, nine responded to five GMA sessions and nine received 10 sessions. At the first evaluation 2 weeks after the last GMA session, 13 of the 20 (65.0%) patients achieved ACR20. ACR20 was maintained in seven of 10 (70%) and five of 10 (50%) patients at the follow-up evaluation points 8 and 20 weeks after the last GMA session, respectively. GMA was well tolerated without any safety concern. This study demonstrates that GMA with the Adacolumn was effective with good safety profile in patients with PsA refractory to pharmacologicals. The results indicate a major role for myeloid leukocytes in the immunopathogenesis of PsA. A large controlled study is warranted to fully evaluate the efficacy of Adacolumn GMA in patients with PsA. ? 2017 Japanese Dermatological Association",adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis; American College of Rheumatology score 20; myeloid lineage leukocytes; neutrophils; psoriatic arthritis,"adalimumab; cyclosporin; infliximab; methotrexate; ustekinumab; adult; aged; American College of Rheumatology score 20; apheresis; Article; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; common cold symptom; disease activity score; disease severity; dizziness; female; follow up; granulocyte and monocyte apheresis; human; leukocyte; male; multicenter study; myeloid lineage leukocyte; pain; psoriatic arthritis; puncture pain; safety; bone marrow cell; clinical trial; leukapheresis; middle aged; patient compliance; psoriatic arthritis; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Female; Humans; Leukocyte Reduction Procedures; Male; Middle Aged; Myeloid Cells; Patient Compliance; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85026727701

Materials and Methods: Twelve consecutive patients with 15 AMLs, 9 females and 3 males, with a median age of 44?years (range, 11–81), underwent this procedure between 2011 and 2016. In all procedures, a micro-balloon catheter was advanced to the feeding artery of the AML and TAE was performed with a mixture of ethanol and lipiodol under balloon inflation. We reviewed medical records and images, and evaluated the technical success rate, clinical success rate, and complications. Technical success was defined as completion of TAE using the micro-balloon catheter and the mixture of ethanol and lipiodol. Clinical success was defined as reduction of tumor size on CT, which was performed before and after TAE. Results: In 14 of 15 AMLs, the micro-balloon catheter could be advanced to the feeding artery, and TAE was performed successfully. Thus, the technical success rate was 93%. Among these 14 AMLs of 11 patients, 13 AMLs of 10 patients could be followed and tumor shrinkage was confirmed in all. Thus, the clinical success rate was 100%. Four patients had mild symptoms after TAE; the minor complication rate was 33% (4/12), and the major complication rate was 0%. Conclusion: TAE for renal AML using the micro-balloon catheter and mixture of ethanol and lipiodol appears to be effective and safe. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",,"alcohol; iodinated poppyseed oil; alcohol; antineoplastic agent; ethiodized oil; adolescent; adult; aged; angiomyolipoma; arterial embolization; Article; catheter complication; child; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; coil embolization; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; female; fever; human; kidney disease; kidney infarction; male; medical record review; outcome assessment; pain; patient safety; priority journal; retrospective study; symptom; tumor volume; angiomyolipoma; catheter; chemoembolization; devices; kidney tumor; middle aged; procedures; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Angiomyolipoma; Antineoplastic Agents; Catheters; Chemoembolization, Therapeutic; Child; Ethanol; Ethiodized Oil; Female; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85021914325

Mutations in EPG5, a gene that encodes a key autophagy regulator, have been shown to cause VICIS, however, the precise pathomechanism underlying VICIS is yet to be clarified. Here, we describe detailed clinical (including brain MRI and muscle biopsy) and genetic features of nine Japanese patients with VICIS. Genetic dissection of these nine patients from seven families identified 14 causative mutations in EPG5. These included five nonsense, two frameshift, three splicing, one missense, and one multi-exon deletion mutations, and two initiation codon variants. Furthermore, cultured skin fibroblasts (SFs) from two affected patients demonstrated partial autophagic dysfunction. To investigate the function of EPG5, siRNA based EPG5 knock-down, and CRISPR/Cas9 mediated EPG5 knock-out HeLa cells were generated. EPG5-depleted cells exhibited a complete block of autophagic flux caused by defective autophagosome-lysosome fusion. Unexpectedly, endocytic degradation was normal in both VICIS SFs and EPG5 depleted cells, suggesting that EPG5 function is limited to the regulation of autophagosome-lysosome fusion. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"EPG5 protein, human; protein; Asian continental ancestry group; autophagosome; biopsy; brain; cataract; corpus callosum agenesis; diagnostic imaging; epithelium cell; family health; fibroblast; gene knockdown; gene knockout; genetics; HeLa cell line; human; lysosome; mental disease; metabolism; muscle; mutation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; Agenesis of Corpus Callosum; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Autophagosomes; Biopsy; Brain; Cataract; Epithelial Cells; Family Health; Fibroblasts; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Gene Knockout Techniques; HeLa Cells; Humans; Lysosomes; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Muscles; Mutation; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Proteins",2-s2.0-85020525653

Super-enhancers are also often enriched at cancer genes in various malignancies. The identification of such enhancers would pinpoint critical factors that directly contribute to pathogenesis. In this study, we performed enhancer profiling using primary leukemia samples from adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL), which is a genetically heterogeneous intractable cancer. Super-enhancers were enriched at genes involved in the T-cell activation pathway, including IL2RA/CD25, CD30, and FYN, in both ATL and normal mature T cells, which reflected the origin of the leukemic cells. Super-enhancers were found at several known cancer gene loci, including CCR4, PIK3R1, and TP73, in multiple ATL samples, but not in normal mature T cells, which implicated those genes in ATL pathogenesis. A small-molecule CDK7 inhibitor, THZ1, efficiently inhibited cell growth induced apoptosis and downregulated the expression of super-enhancer–associated genes in ATL cells. Furthermore, enhancer profiling combined with gene expression analysis identified a previously uncharacterized gene, TIAM2, that was associated with super-enhancers in all ATL samples, but not in normal T cells. Knockdown of TIAM2 induced apoptosis in ATL cell lines, whereas overexpression of this gene promoted cell growth.

We developed a heart model for simulation and training of minimally invasive cardiac surgery, particularly minimally invasive mitral valve repair using our new three-dimensional printing system. Methods: Digital imaging and communication in medicine data from patient computed tomography, three-dimensional computer-aided design, and three-dimensional printing helped create replicas of the heart and thoracic cavity. A polyvinyl alcohol model material with a texture and physical properties similar to those of heart tissue was initially used in mitral valve replicas to simulate surgical procedures. To develop this material, we mechanically investigated the composition of each part of the porcine heart. Results: We investigated the elastic modulus and breaking strength of the porcine heart. Based on investigation results, the cardiac model was set at rupture strength 20 MPa, elastic modulus 0.17 MPa, and moisture content 85%. This provided a biotexture and feeling exactly like a patient heart. Computed tomography scans confirmed that the model shape was nearly the same as that of a human heart. We simulated minimally invasive mitral valve repair, including ring annuloplasty, chordal reconstruction, resection and suture, and edge-to-edge repair.

Recent epidemiologic studies demonstrate that sensitization to SEs is increased in healthy smokers; however, there is no evidence on the association between sensitization to SEs and eosinophilic inflammation in smokers with asthma. Objective: To clarify the role of SEs on clinical indexes, including eosinophilic inflammation and lung function in smokers with asthma. Methods: The frequency of atopic sensitization to SEs was examined in adult patients with asthma. In current or ex-smokers with asthma, the association of sensitization to SEs with eosinophilic inflammation, airflow limitation, or treatment steps was determined. Clinical indexes were examined at the first visit, and treatment steps were assessed 6 months after enrollment. Results: Overall, 23 current smokers, 40 ex-smokers, and 118 never smokers with asthma were enrolled. The frequency of sensitization to SEs, but not to other aeroallergens, was significantly higher in current, ex-, and never smokers, in decreasing order. In current or ex-smokers with asthma, patients with sensitization to SEs exhibited higher serum levels of total and specific IgE to aeroallergens, higher blood eosinophil counts, greater airflow limitation, and more severe disease 6 months later than those without sensitization to SE. A longer smoking abstinence period was associated with serum specific IgE levels to SEs, and 3 years was the best cutoff of abstinence period to predict the absence of sensitization to SEs. Conclusion: Sensitization to SEs is increased in smokers with asthma, and it may be a marker of eosinophilic inflammation and severe asthma in smokers with asthma.

The level of 8-oxoguanine, a major oxidatively modified base in DNA, is maintained very low by three distinct enzymes, encoded by OGG1, MUTYH and MTH1. Germline biallelic inactivation of MUTYH represents a familial cancer syndrome called MUTYH-associated polyposis. Here, we used Mutyh-deficient mice to evaluate renal carcinogenesis induced by ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA). Although the C57BL/6 background is cancer-resistant, a repeated intraperitoneal administration of Fe-NTA induced a high incidence of renal cell carcinoma (RCC; 26.7%) in Mutyh-deficient mice in comparison to wild-type mice (7.1%). Fe-NTA treatment also induced renal malignant lymphoma, which did not occur without the Fe-NTA treatment in both the genotypes. Renal tumor-free survival after Fe-NTA treatment was marginally different (P = 0.157) between the two genotypes. Array-based comparative genome hybridization analyses revealed, in RCC, the loss of heterozygosity in chromosomes 4 and 12 without p16INK A inactivation; these results were confirmed by a methylation analysis and showed no significant difference between the genotypes. Lymphomas showed a preference for genomic amplifications. Dlk1 inactivation by promoter methylation may be involved in carcinogenesis in both tumors.

NPS consists of 2 groups: Group A patients were expected to have better neurological outcomes, and Group B patients were expected to have poorer outcomes. NPS robustness was tested in various situations. METHODS In total, 3040 patients with brain metastases that were treated with GKRS were analyzed. The cumulative incidence of the loss of neurological function independence (i.e., neurological deterioration) was estimated using competing risk analysis, and NPS was compared between Groups A and B by employing Gray's model. NPS was tested to determine if it can be applied to 5 cancer categories-non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, gastrointestinal tract cancer, breast cancer, and other cancers-as well as if it can be incorporated into the 5 major grading systems: Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA), score index for stereotactic radiosurgery (SIR), basic score for brain metastases (BSBM), graded prognostic assessment (GPA), and modified-RPA (M-RPA). RESULTS There were 2263 patients in NPS Group A and 777 patients in Group B. Neurological deterioration was observed in 586 patients (19.2%). The cumulative incidences of neurological deterioration were 9.5% versus 21.0%, 14.1% versus 25.4%, and 17.6% versus 27.8% in NPS Groups A and B at 1, 2, and 5 years, respectively. Significant differences were detected between the NPS groups in all cancer categories. There were significant differences between NPS Groups A and B for all classes in terms of the BSBM, GPA, and M-RPA systems, but the differences failed to reach statistical significance in terms of RPA Class I and SIR Class 0 to 3. CONCLUSIONS The NPS was verified as being highly applicable to all cancer categories and almost all classes for the 5 grading systems in terms of neurological function independence. This NPS system appears to be quite robust in various situations for brain metastasis patients treated with GKRS. ?

We used the GRADE methodology to aid in moving from evidence to decision making and ultimately to generating final recommendations. Auto-HCT in front-line consolidation is recommended in peripheral T cell lymphoma not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS), angioimmunoblastic T cell lymphoma (AITL), anaplastic large cell lymphoma–anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALCL-ALK)-negative, NK/T cell (disseminated), enteropathy-associated T cell lymphoma (EATL), and hepatosplenic lymphomas. Auto-HCT in relapsed-sensitive disease is recommended for NK/T cell (localized and disseminated), EATL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell, and ALCL-ALK–positive lymphomas. Auto-HCT is also recommended for PTCL-NOS, AITL, and ALCL-ALK–negative lymphomas if not performed as front-line therapy. Auto-HCT in refractory (primary or relapsed) disease is not recommended for any of the histological subtypes discussed. Allo-HCT in front-line consolidation is recommended for NK/T cell (disseminated), adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL; acute and lymphoma type), and hepatosplenic lymphomas. Allo-HCT for relapsed-sensitive disease is recommended for PTCL-NOS, AITL, ALCL-ALK–negative, ALCL-ALK–positive, NK/T cell (localized and disseminated), ATLL (acute, lymphoma type, smoldering/chronic), mycosis fungoides/Sezary syndrome (advanced stage IIB-IVB or tumor stage/extracutaneous), EATL, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T cell, and hepatosplenic lymphoma. Allo-HCT in refractory (primary or relapsed refractory) disease is recommended for any aforementioned histological subtypes. Emerging novel therapies will likely be incorporated into the pretransplantation, peritransplantation, and post-transplantation algorithms (auto-HCT or allo-HCT) with the goals of optimizing efficacy and improving outcomes.

In this study, we examined alterations of AdCC-associated genes, MYB, MYBL1, MYBL2 and NFIB, and their target molecules, including MYC. The results were correlated to clinicopathological profile of the patients. Methods and results: Using paraffin tumour sections from 33 cases of salivary gland AdCC, we performed a detailed fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) analysis for gene splits and fusions of MYB, MYBL1, MYBL2 and NFIB. We found that 29 of 33 (88%) AdCC cases showed gene splits in either MYB, MYBL1 or NFIB. None of the cases showed an MYBL2 gene alteration. AdCCs were divided genetically into six gene groups, MYB–NFIB (n?=?16), MYB–X (n?=?4), MYBL1–NFIB (n?=?2), MYBL1–X (n?=?1), NFIB–X (n?=?6) and gene-split-negative (n?=?4). AdCC patients showing the MYB or MYBL1 gene splits were associated with microscopically positive surgical margins (P?=?0.0148) and overexpression of MYC (P?=?0.0164). MYC expression was detected in both ductal and myoepithelial tumour cells, and MYC overexpression was associated with shorter disease-free survival of the patients (P?=?0.0268). Conclusions: The present study suggests that (1) nearly 90% of AdCCs may have gene alterations of either MYB, MYBL1 or NFIB, suggesting the diagnostic utility of the FISH assay, (2) MYB or MYBL1 gene splits may be associated with local aggressiveness of the tumours and overexpression of MYC, which is one of the oncogenic MYB/MYBL1 targets and (3) MYC overexpression may be a risk factor for disease-free survival in AdCC. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",adenoid cystic carcinoma; FISH; MYB; MYBL1; MYBL2; MYC; NFIB,"mucin; MYBL1 protein; MYBL2 protein; Myc protein; NFIB protein; protein; protein Myb; unclassified drug; cell cycle protein; MYBL1 protein, human; MYBL2 protein, human; Myc protein; MYC protein, human; NFIB protein, human; nuclear factor I; oncoprotein; transactivator protein; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; carcinogenesis; clinical article; clinical feature; controlled study; diagnostic value; disease free survival; distant metastasis; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene expression; gene fusion; genetic association; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lymph node metastasis; male; mutation; myoepithelium cell; overall survival; priority journal; salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma; tumor recurrence; adenoid cystic carcinoma; gene translocation; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; mortality; oncogene myb; pathology; proportional hazards model; salivary gland tumor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic; Cell Cycle Proteins; Female; Genes, myb; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; NFI Transcription Factors; Oncogene Proteins v-myb; Proportional Hazards Models; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Salivary Gland Neoplasms; Trans-Activators; Translocation, Genetic",2-s2.0-85030684621

Little is known about the biological significance of the Trk family in human lung squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Here we investigated the clinical significance of the protein expression of Trk family members in samples from 99 SCC patients, and we explored the relationship between invasion/proliferation activities and Trk expression using lung SCC cell lines to clarify the biological significance of the Trk family in lung SCC. Immunohistochemical high expression of TrkB was significantly correlated with vascular invasion (P=0.004), lymph node metastasis (P<0.001), and advanced stage (P=0.0015). The overall survival of the patients with TrkB-high expression was significantly shorter than those with TrkB-low expression (P=0.0110). TrkA/TrkC expressions were not predictors of poor prognosis. An in vitro assay demonstrated that the inhibition of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (a TrkB ligand) and TrkB by K252a (a Trk inhibitor) or siRNA (BDNF-siRNA, TrkB-siRNA) suppressed the invasion, migration, and proliferative activities of lung SCC cells. The administration of recombinant human BDNF (rhBDNF) enhanced the invasion, migration, and proliferation activities, which were abrogated by K252a. TrkB-siRNA transfection increased the protein expression of E-cadherin and decreased vimentin expressions in lung SCC cells. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2)-mediated gelatin degradations were decreased in lung SCC cells transfected with TrkB-siRNA. Thus, TrkB-high expression is an indicator of poor prognosis in lung SCC, probably due to invasion/proliferation activities promoted by the BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway, which could become a therapeutic target for lung SCC. ? 2017 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.",,"brain derived neurotrophic factor; gelatinase A; tropomyosin; tropomyosin related kinase b; unclassified drug; uvomorulin; vimentin; brain derived neurotrophic factor; brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; brain-derived neurotrophic factor, human; membrane protein; neurotrophin 3 receptor; protein tyrosine kinase A; recombinant protein; TRKA protein, human; tropomyosin-related kinase-B, human; tumor protein; adult; aged; aggression; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cell invasion; cell migration; cell proliferation; down regulation; family; female; genetic transfection; human; human cell; in vitro study; lung squamous carcinoma cell line; lymph node metastasis; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; male; overall survival; phenotype; predictive value; priority journal; protein expression; squamous cell lung carcinoma; Western blotting; agonists; antagonists and inhibitors; cancer grading; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; chemistry; comparative study; genetics; lung; Lung Neoplasms; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; prognosis; retrospective study; RNA interference; signal transduction; tumor cell line; tumor invasion; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Female; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Receptor, trkA; Receptor, trkB; Receptor, trkC; Recombinant Proteins; Retrospective Studies; RNA Interference; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85029424279

We used individual-level pooled data from ten case-control studies (5959 cases and 12,248 controls) participating in the International Head and Neck Cancer Epidemiology (INHANCE) consortium, to examine the association between fiber intake and cancer of the oral cavity/pharynx and larynx. Odds Ratios (ORs) and their 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs) were estimated using unconditional multiple logistic regression applied to quintile categories of non-alcohol energy-adjusted fiber intake and adjusted for tobacco and alcohol use and other known or putative confounders. Fiber intake was inversely associated with oral and pharyngeal cancer combined (OR for 5th vs. 1st quintile category = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.40–0.59; p for trend <0.001) and with laryngeal cancer (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.54–0.82, p for trend <0.001). There was, however, appreciable heterogeneity of the estimated effect across studies for oral and pharyngeal cancer combined. Nonetheless, inverse associations were consistently observed for the subsites of oral and pharyngeal cancers and within most strata of the considered covariates, for both cancer sites. Our findings from a multicenter large-scale pooled analysis suggest that, although in the presence of between-study heterogeneity, a greater intake of fiber may lower HNC risk. ? 2017 UICC",dietary fiber intake; head and neck cancer; INHANCE; laryngeal cancer; oral cavity and pharyngeal cancer,"adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; cancer risk; case control study; controlled study; dietary fiber; dietary intake; disease association; epidemiological data; female; head and neck cancer; human; larynx cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth cancer; pharynx cancer; priority journal; tobacco consumption; adverse effects; diet therapy; dietary fiber; drinking behavior; Head and Neck Neoplasms; larynx tumor; pathology; risk factor; squamous cell carcinoma; therapeutic use; tobacco; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Dietary Fiber; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Pharyngeal Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Tobacco",2-s2.0-85026358989

However, because of the strict enrollment criteria, the patients who participated in these trials might represent a selected group of patients that is poorly representative of patients treated in routine clinical practice. In contrast, clinical characteristics of real-world patients are similar to those of patients enrolled in observational cohort studies (OCSs). Although many OCSs have examined the prognostic effect of RAS inhibitors in HFpEF, the results are inconsistent due to limited power with small sample sizes and/or inadequate adjustment for known prognostic factors. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of OCSs with and those without propensity score (PS) analysis and RCTs on the effect of RAS inhibitors on mortality in HFpEF patients. The search of electronic databases identified 4 OCSs with PS analysis (10,164 patients), 8 OCSs without PS analysis (16,393 patients), and 3 RCTs (8001 patients). Use of RAS inhibitors was associated with reduced mortality in the pooled analysis of OCSs with PS analysis (RR [95% CI]?=?0.90 [0.81–1.00]) and in that of OCSs without PS analysis (0.81 [0.68–0.96]) but not in that of RCTs (0.99 [0.87–1.12]). In conclusion, the present meta-analysis suggests the potential mortality benefit of RAS inhibitors in HFpEF, emphasizing the importance of conducting new well-designed RCTs. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Angiotensin receptor blockers; Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors; Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; Meta-analysis; Propensity score analysis,candesartan; irbesartan; perindopril; angiotensin receptor antagonist; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular mortality; clinical practice; comorbidity; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; hospitalization; human; hypertension; meta analysis; meta analysis (topic); prognosis; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; survival rate; systematic review; drug effect; global health; heart failure; heart stroke volume; mortality; observational study; pathophysiology; physiology; randomized controlled trial (topic); renin angiotensin aldosterone system; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; Global Health; Heart Failure; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Renin-Angiotensin System; Stroke Volume; Survival Rate,2-s2.0-85023202586

Patients aged ?20?years received romidepsin via a 4-h intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. Phase I used a 3?+?3 design to identify any dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) for regimens of romidepsin 9 and 14?mg/m2.

It is of urgent need to develop new therapy for heart failure. Heart failure is characterized by increased sympathetic activity, and chronic sympathetic activation is involved in the maintenance of the pathological state. Catheter-based renal denervation (RDN) has emerged as an invasive but safe approach that can reduce sympathetic activation. Studies have reported inconsistent results regarding the effect of RDN in heart failure patients due to limited power with small sample sizes. We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of the effect of RDN on heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction (EF). An electronic search for studies examining the effect of RDN on LV function in heart failure patients with reduced EF was conducted. Two controlled (80 patients) and 2 uncontrolled studies (21 patients) were included in this meta-analysis. In the pooled analysis, 6?months after RDN, there was a greater increase in EF (weighted mean difference [95% CI]?=?8.63 [6.02, 11.24] %) and a greater decrease in LV end-diastolic diameter (?0.58 [?0.83, ?0.34] cm) in RDN group than in control group. No serious adverse events such as acute renal artery stenosis and dissection occurred. Our meta-analysis of feasibility studies suggests that RDN may improve LV function in heart failure patients with reduced EF, providing the rationale to conduct next phase trials to confirm the observed potential benefits of RDN. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Heart failure; Meta-analysis; Renal denervation; Sympathetic nervous system,"aldosterone antagonist; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; catheter based renal denervation; estimated glomerular filtration rate; feasibility study; genetic heterogeneity; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart rate; human; kidney denervation; kidney function; meta analysis; New York Heart Association class; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; Review; systematic review; systolic blood pressure; adrenergic system; animal; catheter ablation; heart failure; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; innervation; kidney; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; sympathectomy; Animals; Catheter Ablation; Heart Failure; Humans; Kidney; Stroke Volume; Sympathectomy; Sympathetic Nervous System; Ventricular Function, Left",2-s2.0-85021190980

Methods: Overall, 530 Japanese patients who were infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1 received SOF/LDV therapy for 12 weeks, and resistance-associated variants (RAVs) in the hepatitis C virus non-structural protein (NS)5A and NS5B regions were assessed at baseline and virological relapse by direct sequencing. Results: Sustained virological response (SVR) rates did not significantly differ between patients with and without NS5A Y93H/N (94.2% [113/120] vs. 97.7% [345/353]), but the SVR rate was significantly lower in patients with prior DCV/ASV therapy compared to those without (69.2% [18/26] vs. 98.4% [496/504], P <?0.001). Among 26 patients with prior DCV/ASV therapy, the prevalence of NS5A multi-RAVs (?2) was similar between responders and non-responders (61% [11/18] vs. 75% [5/8]), but all patients without RAVs achieved SVR. Multivariate analysis showed that prior DCV/ASV therapy and history of hepatocellular carcinoma were independently associated with treatment failure (odds ratio, 37.55; 95% confidence interval, 10.78–130.76; P <?0.001 for prior DCV/ASV therapy; odds ratio, 4.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.09–18.04; P = 0.03 for the history of HCC). All SOF/LDV failure patients (n = 8) with prior DCV/ASV treatment had two or more factors of cirrhosis, IL28B unfavorable genotype, and baseline NS5A multi-RAVs. The multiple NS5A RAVs had increased but NS5B substitutions, C316N/A207T/A218S or L159F, had not changed at the time of relapse.

Objectives: To elucidate the characteristics of Japanese patients with KATP-NDM. Methods: By the amplification and direct sequencing of all exons and exon-intron boundaries of the KCNJ11 and ABCC8 genes, 25 patients with KATP-NDM were identified from a total of 70 patients with NDM. Clinical data were collected from the medical charts. Results: Sixteen patients had mutations in KCNJ11 and nine in ABCC8. Eight novel mutations were identified; two in KCNJ11 (V64M, R201G) and six in ABCC8 (R216C, G832C, F1176L, A1263V, I196N, T229N). Interestingly, V64M caused DEND (developmental delay, epilepsy, neonatal diabetes) syndrome in our patient, while mutation of the same residue (V64G) had been reported to cause congenital hyperinsulinism. Mutations in ABCC8 were associated with TNDM (4/9) or isolated PNDM (5/9), whereas those in KCNJ11 were associated with more severe phenotypes, including DEND (3/16), iDEND (intermediate DEND, 4/16), or isolated PNDM (6/16). Switching from insulin to glibenclamide monotherapy was successful in 87.5% of the patients. Neurological improvement was observed in two patients, one with DEND (T293N) and one with iDEND (R50P) syndrome. Three others with iDEND mutations (R201C, G53D, and V59M) remained neurologically normal at 5, 1, and 4 years of age, respectively, with early introduction of sulfonylurea. Conclusion: Overall, clinical presentation of KATP-NDM in Japanese patients was similar to those of other populations.

These oral agents target androgen and androgen receptor signaling and are thought to be less toxic than chemotherapy. Cross-resistance to these agents was recently reported because of their similar mechanism of action, and it is important to assess which agent is more effective to use initially for CRPC. Methods/design: The present study is a phase III, investigator-initiated, multicenter, head-to-head, randomized controlled trial investigating enzalutamide vs. abiraterone as a first-line treatment for CRPC patients. Patients will be randomly assigned to an enzalutamide or an abiraterone treatment group. The primary endpoint is the time to prostate-specific antigen progression. The target sample size is set at 100 patients per group (total, 200 patients). The study duration is 5 years, and the duration for recruitment is 2 years and 6 months. Discussion: Thus far, there have been no prospective head-to-head studies comparing enzalutamide and abiraterone. This ENABLE study will clarify which agent should be prioritized for CRPC patients and enable clinicians to decide the appropriate treatment before chemotherapy.

However, inefficient reprocessing and unavailability of ureteroscopes sent out for repair can contribute to expensive operating room (OR) delays. Time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) was applied to describe the time and costs involved in reprocessing. Materials and Methods: Direct observation and timing were performed for all steps in reprocessing of reusable flexible ureteroscopes following operative procedures. Estimated times needed for each step by which damaged ureteroscopes identified during reprocessing are sent for repair were characterized through interviews with purchasing analyst staff. Process maps were created for reprocessing and repair detailing individual step times and their variances. Cost data for labor and disposables used were applied to calculate per minute and average step costs. Results: Ten ureteroscopes were followed through reprocessing. Process mapping for ureteroscope reprocessing averaged 229.0 ± 74.4 minutes, whereas sending a ureteroscope for repair required an estimated 143 minutes per repair. Most steps demonstrated low variance between timed observations. Ureteroscope drying was the longest and highest variance step at 126.5 ± 55.7 minutes and was highly dependent on manual air flushing through the ureteroscope working channel and ureteroscope positioning in the drying cabinet. Total costs for reprocessing totaled $96.13 per episode, including the cost of labor and disposable items. Conclusions: Utilizing TDABC delineates the full spectrum of costs associated with ureteroscope reprocessing and identifies areas for process improvement to drive value-based care. At our institution, ureteroscope drying was one clearly identified target area. Implementing training in ureteroscope drying technique could save up to 2 hours per reprocessing event potentially preventing expensive OR delays. ?

Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of ATL patients enrolled in two studies are herein updated, namely NCT00355472 (phase I study of mogamulizumab in relapsed patients with ATL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma) and NCT00920790 (phase II study for relapsed ATL). Of 13 patients with relapsed aggressive ATL in the phase I study, four (31%) survived >3 years. For 26 relapsed patients with aggressive ATL in the phase II study, median PFS was 5.2 months and 1-year PFS was 26%, whereas median OS was 14.4 months, and 3-year OS was 23%. For patients without a rash or who developed a grade 1 rash only, median PFS was 0.8 months, and 1-year PFS was zero, with a median OS of 6.0 months, and 3-year OS of 8%. In contrast, for patients who developed a rash ?grade 2, median PFS was 11.7 months, and 1-year PFS was 50%, with a median OS of 25.6 months, and 3-year OS of 36%. Thus, we conclude that mogamulizumab monotherapy may improve PFS and OS in some patients with relapsed aggressive ATL, especially those who develop a skin rash as a moderate immune-related adverse event. Therefore, further investigation is warranted to validate the present observations and to clarify the mechanisms involved in the activity of mogamulizumab. ? 2017 The Authors.

The treatment methods for MRONJ, nonsurgical and surgical, are controversial, with no agreement as to which method provides the best outcome and should therefore be recommended. This multicenter retrospective study aimed to investigate the treatment methods and outcome in a large number of patients with MRONJ in Japan, utilizing propensity score matching analysis. A total of 361 patients with MRONJ, at eight hospitals, were registered in this study retrospectively. Various demographic and treatment-related variables were examined and analyzed to determine their correlation with the treatment outcome. After propensity score matching for treatment methods (nonsurgical versus surgical treatment), 176 patients were analyzed by logistic regression. It was shown that those with low-dose administration of an antiresorptive agent and surgical treatment had better outcomes. Furthermore, in 159 patients who underwent surgical treatment, those who underwent extensive surgery experienced significantly better treatment outcomes than those who underwent conservative surgery. This is the first study to compare treatment methods for MRONJ using propensity score matching analysis. The results indicated that extensive surgical treatment should be performed as first-choice therapy for patients with MRONJ. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. ? 2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research",CLINICAL TRIALS; DENTAL BIOLOGY; MEDICATION-RELATED OSTEONECROSIS OF THE JAWS (MRONJ); OSTEOPOROSIS; TUMOR-INDUCED BONE DISEASE,albumin; bisphosphonic acid derivative; denosumab; aged; albumin blood level; Article; conservative treatment; controlled study; correlation analysis; drug dose comparison; drug megadose; drug withdrawal; female; healing; hospital; human; Japan; jaw osteonecrosis; low drug dose; major clinical study; male; maxillofacial surgery; propensity score; retrospective study; treatment outcome; clinical trial; jaw osteonecrosis; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; pathology; propensity score; risk factor; treatment outcome; wound healing; Aged; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; Female; Humans; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Wound Healing,2-s2.0-85026375162

High cholesterol (HC) intake, which often underlies obesity, is suggested to play a role in the mechanism. We aimed to elucidate the effect of a HC diet on acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury, the most frequent cause of acute liver failure in the USA. Methods C57BL/6 Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) knockout (Tlr9?/?) mice and their Tlr9+/+ littermates were fed an HC diet for four weeks and then treated with acetaminophen. Liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) were isolated from the mice for in vivo and in vitro analyses. Results The HC diet exacerbated acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury in a TLR9/inflammasome pathway-dependent manner. LSECs played a major role in the cholesterol loading-induced exacerbation. The accumulation of free cholesterol in the endolysosomes in LSECs enhanced TLR9-mediated signaling, thereby exacerbating the pathology of acetaminophen-induced liver injury through the activation of the TLR9/inflammasome pathway. The accumulation of free cholesterol in LSEC endolysosomes induced a dysfunction of the Rab7 membrane trafficking recycling mechanism, thus disrupting the transport of TLR9 from late endosomes to the lysosomes. Consequently, the level of active TLR9 in the late endosomes increased, thereby enhancing TLR9 signaling in LSECs. Conclusions HC intake exaggerated acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury via free cholesterol accumulation in LSECs, demonstrating a novel role of free cholesterol as a metabolic factor in TLR9 signal regulation and pathologies of acetaminophen-induced liver injury. Therapeutic approaches may target this pathway. Lay summary: High cholesterol intake exacerbated acetaminophen-induced acute liver injury via the accumulation of free cholesterol in the endolysosomes of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells. This accumulation enhanced Toll-like receptor 9 signaling via impairment of its membrane trafficking mechanism. Thus, free cholesterol accumulation, as an underlying metabolic factor, exacerbated the pathology of acetaminophen-induced liver injury through activation of the TLR9/inflammasome pathway. ? 2017 European Association for the Study of the Liver",Acetaminophen; Endosome; Free cholesterol; Inflammasome; Liver injury; Liver sinusoidal endothelial cell; Lysosome; Metabolic syndrome; Rab7; Toll-like receptor 9,"cathepsin L; cathepsin S; cholesterol; DNA; inflammasome; interleukin 18; interleukin 1beta; lysosome associated membrane protein 2; messenger RNA; paracetamol; Rab protein; Rab7 protein; toll like receptor 9; cholesterol; iCpG-ODN; inflammasome; oligodeoxyribonucleotide; paracetamol; Rab protein; Rab7 protein; Tlr9 protein, mouse; toll like receptor 9; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; B lymphocyte; caspase activation and recruitment domain; cholesterol diet; cholesterol liver level; controlled study; dendritic cell; endosome; endothelium cell; hepatic stellate cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; innate immunity; liver cell; liver toxicity; lysosome; macrophage; male; membrane transport; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein transport; signal transduction; T lymphocyte; animal; C57BL mouse; deficiency; drug effect; endothelium cell; genetics; knockout mouse; lipid diet; liver; metabolism; signal transduction; toxic hepatitis; Acetaminophen; Animals; Chemical and Drug Induced Liver Injury; Cholesterol; Diet, High-Fat; Endothelial Cells; Inflammasomes; Liver; Lysosomes; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Protein Transport; rab GTP-Binding Proteins; Signal Transduction; Toll-Like Receptor 9",2-s2.0-85021856061

Materials and methods Experiments on the human brain were conducted on 12 healthy volunteers (27?±?4?years) using PRESTO and spoiled GRE sequences on a 1.5?T scanner. The PRESTO sequence is an echo-shifted gradient echo sequence that allows high susceptibility sensitivity and rapid acquisition because of TE?>?TR compared with the spoiled GRE sequence. QSM analysis was performed on the obtained phase images using the iLSQR method. Estimated susceptibility maps were used for region of interest analyses and estimation of line profiles through iron-rich tissue and major vessels. Results Our results demonstrated that susceptibility maps were accurately estimated, without error, by QSM analysis of PRESTO and spoiled GRE sequences. Acquisition time in the PRESTO sequence was reduced by 43% compared with that in the spoiled GRE sequence. Differences did exist between susceptibility maps in PRESTO and spoiled GRE sequences for visualization and quantitative values of major blood vessels and the areas around them Conclusion The PRESTO sequence enables correct estimation of tissue susceptibility with rapid acquisition and may be useful for QSM analysis of clinical use of 1.5?T scanners. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",1.5?T MRI; Principles of echo shifting with a train of observations; Quantitative susceptibility mapping,"accuracy; adult; Article; brain region; gradient recalled echo; human; human experiment; image processing; image reconstruction; neuroimaging; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; principles of echo shifting with a train of observation; priority journal; quantitative susceptibility mapping; radiological parameters; sensitivity analysis; volunteer; anatomy and histology; brain; brain mapping; evaluation study; female; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; reference value; reproducibility; Adult; Brain; Brain Mapping; Evaluation Studies as Topic; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results",2-s2.0-85019952473

MTEMMPDA is a safe and effective method to obtain wide, straight access to the maxillary sinus (MS). However, there are few reported cases of patients who underwent MTEMMPDA, and even fewer of patients who underwent partial osteotomy of the apertura piriformis and the anterior wall of the MS. In this study, we analyzed the outcomes of 51 patients who underwent MTEMMPDA. Study Design: Retrospective review. Methods: All patients who underwent MTEMMPDA at our hospital between January 2004 and December 2015 were included in this study. Results: Fifty-one patients with sinonasal IP in the MS underwent MTEMMPDA. Recurrence was seen in the MS of one patient (follow-up of 2–138 months). The IT remained unchanged in all 51 patients without atrophy. We have not observed epiphora, eye discharge, dry nose, or persistent crusting after this surgery. Although seven patients had numbness around the upper lip after surgery, this had disappeared by 1 year after surgery. Additional partial osteotomy of the apertura piriformis and the anterior wall of the MS were done in eight patients. Deformation of the external nose was not seen. Conclusion: This approach appears to be a safe and effective method to resect IP in the MS, even if there is additional partial osteotomy of the apertura piriformis and the anterior wall of the MS.

Retrospective nationwide questionnaire-based survey of complications. Objective. To elucidate the incidence of complications and risk factors associated with lateral interbody fusion (LIF). Summary of Background Data. After its introduction to Japan in February 2013, the numbers of LIF cases have increased substantially because of the advantages of this minimally invasive procedure. However, LIF has the potential risk of several complications unique to the procedure. Although there are many reports of complications, no nationwide survey has been conducted. Methods. Questionnaires were sent to all Japanese Society for Spine Surgery and Related Research (JSSR) members. Questionnaires requested information about surgical procedures (XLIF or OLIF), patient characteristics, preoperative diagnosis, complications, salvage procedures, final outcomes, and the surgeon's experience of LIF. The data from replies received between March 2013 and April 2015 were recorded on a web site and the details of complications were analyzed by a JSSR research team. Results. Seventy-one institutions (12.3%) answered ""yes"" to LIF experience and 2998 cases (1995 XLIF and 1003 OLIF) were enrolled in this study. The response rate was 86.1%. A total of 540 complications were reported, of which 474 (84.8%) could be further analyzed. The overall complication rate was 18.0%. The most frequent complications were sensory nerve injury (5.1%) and psoas weakness (4.3%) and the majority resolved spontaneously. The rates of major vascular injury, bowel injury, and surgical site infection were 0.03%, 0.03%, and 0.7%, respectively. The overall reoperation rate was 2.2%. Higher rates of sensory nerve injury and psoas weakness were reported for XLIF and higher rates of peritoneal laceration and ureteral injury were reported for OLIF. Conclusion. A nationwide survey of complications associated with LIF was conducted. Although the majority of complications were minor, a relatively high rate of complications was reported. Approach-related specific features of the two procedures were identified. Copyright ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In this study, we used targeted serum proteomics to identify circulating biomarkers for prediction of disease activity and organ involvement in antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV). Methods: A large-scale SRM assay targeting 135 biomarker candidates was established using a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with nanoflow liquid chromatography. Target proteins in serum samples from patients in the active and remission (6 months after treatment) stages were quantified using the established assays. Identified marker candidates were further validated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using serum samples (n = 169) collected in a large-cohort Japanese study (the RemIT-JAV-RPGN study). Results: Our proteomic analysis identified the following proteins as biomarkers for discriminating patients with highly active AAV from those in remission or healthy control subjects: tenascin C (TNC), C-reactive protein (CRP), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 (TIMP1), leucine-rich alpha-2-glycoprotein 1, S100A8/A9, CD93, matrix metalloproteinase 9, and transketolase (TKT). Of these, TIMP1 was the best-performing marker of disease activity, allowing distinction between mildly active AAV and remission. Moreover, in contrast to CRP, serum levels of TIMP1 in patients with active AAV were significantly higher than those in patients with infectious diseases. The serum levels of TKT and CD93 were higher in patients with renal involvement than in those without, and they predicted kidney outcome. The level of circulating TNC was elevated significantly in patients with lung infiltration. AAV severity was associated with markers reflecting organ involvement (TKT, CD93, and TNC) rather than inflammation. The eight markers and myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA were clustered into three groups: MPO-ANCA, renal involvement (TKT and CD93), and inflammation (the other six markers). Conclusions: We have identified promising biomarkers of disease activity, disease severity, and organ involvement in AAV with a targeted proteomics approach using serum samples obtained from a large-cohort Japanese study. Especially, our analysis demonstrated the effectiveness of TIMP1 as a marker of AAV activity. In addition, we identified TKT and CD93 as novel markers for evaluation of renal involvement and kidney outcome in AAV. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis; Biomarkers; Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; Granulomatosis with polyangiitis; Microscopic polyangiitis; Targeted proteomics,biological marker; C reactive protein; calgranulin A; calgranulin B; CD93 antigen; gelatinase B; glycoprotein; leucine rich alpha 2 glycoprotein 1; lymphocyte antigen; myeloperoxidase neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; tenascin; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; transketolase; unclassified drug; biological marker; adult; aged; ANCA associated vasculitis; Article; blood sampling; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease activity; disease association; disease severity; end stage renal disease; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; general aspects of disease; human; Japanese (people); liquid chromatography; lung infiltrate; major clinical study; male; mass spectrometry; nanoflow liquid chromatography; organ involvement; outcome assessment; protein analysis; proteomics; quantitative analysis; remission; selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry; tandem mass spectrometry; targeted proteomics; validation process; ANCA associated vasculitis; blood; middle aged; procedures; proteomics; Aged; Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Proteomics,2-s2.0-85030253143

While the standard recommendation for the management of urine leakage is pelvic floor muscle training, its efficacy is still unsatisfactory. Therefore, we have focused on regenerative therapy, which consists of administering a periurethral injection of autologous regenerative cells from adipose tissue, separated using the Celution? system. Based on an interim data analysis of our exploratory study, we confirmed the efficacy and acceptable safety profile of this treatment. Accordingly, we began discussions with Japanese regulatory authorities regarding the development of this therapy in Japan. The Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare suggested that we implement a clinical trial of a new medical device based on the Pharmaceutical Affaires Act in Japan. Next, we discussed the design of this investigator-initiated clinical trial (the ADRESU study) aimed at evaluating the efficacy and safety of this therapy, in a consultation meeting with the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Device Agency. Methods: The ADRESU study is an open-label, multi-center, single-arm study involving a total of 45 male stress urinary incontinence patients with mild-to-moderate urine leakage persisting more than 1 year after prostatectomy, in spite of behavioral and pharmacological therapies. The primary endpoint is the rate of patients at 52 weeks with improvement of urine leakage volume defined as a reduction from baseline greater than 50% by 24-h pad test. Our specific hypothesis is that the primary endpoint result will be higher than a pre-specified threshold of 10%. Discussion: The ADRESU study is the first clinical trial of regenerative treatment for stress urinary incontinence by adipose-derived regenerative cells using the Celution? system based on the Japanese Pharmaceutical Affaires Act. We will evaluate the efficacy and safety in this trial to provide an adequate basis for marketing approval with the final objective of making this novel therapy widely available for Japanese patients.

MDSCs are increased after adjuvant therapy with toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 ligands, such as Pam2CSK4, in tumor-bearing mice. However, it remains unknown if the activation of TLR2 in MDSCs affects their function and the therapeutic efficacy of TLR2 ligand. Here, we show that TLR2 signaling in CD11b+Ly6G?Ly6Chigh monocytic MDSCs (M-MDSCs), but not CD11b+Ly6G+Ly6Clow granulocytic MDSCs (G-MDSCs), enhances their immunosuppressive activity, thereby limiting anti-tumor T cell responses induced by TLR2-activated dendritic cells (DCs). iNOS induction was critical for Pam2CSK4-enhanced T cell suppression by M-MDSCs. iNOS was expressed in M-MDSC-derived macrophages, but not undifferentiated M-MDSCs, in cocultures with CD8+ T cells, CD11c+ DCs, antigen peptide and Pam2CSK4. Pam2CSK4 increased the differentiation frequency of M-MDSCs to macrophages, and iNOS expression required interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production by CD8+ T cells that had been transiently stimulated by M-MDSC-derived macrophages in an antigen/TLR2-dependent manner. Although Pam2CSK4 triggered DC maturation and tumor regression via induction of tumor antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses in tumor-bearing mice, Pam2CSK4 plus antigen increased the frequency of iNOS+ macrophages in the tumor. Treatment with iNOS inhibitor enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of Pam2CSK4. Hence, the results suggest that TLR2 ligand and T cell-derived IFN-γ enhance M-MDSC-mediated immunosuppression, which may negatively regulate anti-tumor CTL response. ? 2017 The Author(s).

This study aimed to clarify the differences in the remission status defined by the criteria, including and excluding PROMs, and to identify the baseline predictors of long-term prognosis using 7-year follow-up data. Method: A total of 103 RA outpatients completed the baseline and 7-year follow-up questionnaire surveys. Pain visual analogue scale (VAS) of ? 1/10 was used as a PROM criterion for remission. Results: Only 10 patients achieved full-remission, whereas 18 met the partial-remission criteria excluding PROM at baseline. Although 70.0% of those who achieved full remission at baseline had full or partial remission status, 77.8% of those with partial remission were categorized as having no remission at 7 years. Significant baseline differences in the remission status at 7 years were observed with regard to disease duration, pain VAS, and physical function (Short Form 36 [SF-36]). Stepwise logistic regression analysis adjusted for age and sex identified disease duration and general health perception (SF-36) as independent predictors of full-remission. Conclusion: Remission criteria including PROMs are stringent but important to achieve sustained remission. Early intensive treatment and efforts to improve patients’ health perceptions may result in better prognosis for RA. ? 2015 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd",epidemiology; outcome measure; prognostic factor,"adult; age; aged; Article; clinical assessment tool; controlled study; disease duration; female; follow up; functional assessment; gender; human; major clinical study; male; outpatient; pain assessment; patient attitude; patient-reported outcome; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; questionnaire; remission; rheumatoid arthritis; Short Form 36; visual analog scale; chi square distribution; health status; middle aged; multivariate analysis; nomenclature; odds ratio; pain measurement; pathophysiology; psychology; rheumatoid arthritis; statistical model; time factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Pain Measurement; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Remission Induction; Terminology as Topic; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85030766152

The live birth rate is limited to only 70-80% in patients with APS undergoing established anticoagulant therapy. Lupus anticoagulant (LA), but not anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), was found to predict adverse pregnancy outcome. Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of APS focusing on aCL have shown that several molecules may be involved. This is the first GWAS for obstetric APS focusing on LA. A GWAS was performed to compare 115 Japanese patients with obstetric APS, diagnosed according to criteria of the International Congress on APS, and 419 healthy individuals. Allele or genotype frequencies were compared in a total of 426 344 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Imputation analyses were also performed for the candidate regions detected by the GWAS. One SNP (rs2288493) located on the 3'-UTR of TSHR showed an experiment-wide significant APS association (P=7.85E-08, OR=6.18) under a recessive model after Bonferroni correction considering the number of analyzed SNPs. Another SNP (rs79154414) located around the C1D showed a genome-wide significant APS association (P=4.84E-08, OR=6.20) under an allelic model after applying the SNP imputation.

Alcohol drinking is an established risk factor for HNC, and this association may be stronger among cancers of the oropharynx and hypopharynx than the oral cavity or larynx. In addition, higher alcohol consumption over a shorter period was more harmful than fewer alcohol consumption over a longer period, and the most frequently consumed alcoholic beverages in a population is likely to be associated with the highest risk of HNC in that population. The risk of HNC after ??20?years of alcohol cessation appear to be similar to the risk among never drinkers. The interaction between genetic polymorphisms related to alcohol metabolism and alcohol drinking on the risk of HNC has been noted, and the prevalence of these genetic polymorphisms in each population should be of concern. Finally, the association between alcohol drinking and the survival of individuals with HNC remains unclear, and mortality due to competing causes should be considered in future research to evaluate this association. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Alcohol; Cessation; Head and neck cancer; Risk; SNPs; Survival,"alcohol; alcohol abstinence; alcohol consumption; alcohol metabolism; alcoholic beverage; Article; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cancer survival; drinking behavior; genetic polymorphism; head and neck cancer; human; hypopharynx cancer; oropharynx cancer; priority journal; drinking behavior; genetics; head and neck tumor; metabolism; single nucleotide polymorphism; squamous cell carcinoma; Alcohol Drinking; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-85027519301

Methods A multicenter, retrospective study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of sofosbuvir/ribavirin based on real-world clinical data. Results The subjects consisted of 270 patients, 47.0% of whom were aged ?65 years. The sustained virological response rates in patients aged <65 and ?65 years were 98.6% and 95.3%, respectively. Hemoglobin levels decreased during treatment due to ribavirin-related hemolysis, and were significantly lower in patients aged ?65 years than those aged <65 years at all time-points. A reduction in ribavirin dose was necessary in 31.0% (26/84) of patients with hemoglobin levels <13.0 g/dL and in 70.7% (39/127) of those aged >65 years. Although the most frequent adverse event was anemia, no patients discontinued the use of either ribavirin or sofosbuvir. The incidence of ribavirin-related anemia in patients aged ?65 years was 34.6% and significantly higher compared with that in patients aged <65 years (2.8%).

The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of recipient BMSCs intravenous infusion for immunomodulation in a rat vascularized composite allotransplantation model. Methods: A total of nine Wistar (WIS) rats and thirty Lewis (LEW) rats were used. BMSCs were harvested from three LEW rats. Twenty-four LEW rats were used as recipients and divided randomly into four groups: BMSC group, FK group, UT group, and Iso group. In the BMSC group, orthotopic rat hind limb transplantation was performed between WIS donor and LEW recipient rats. Recipient rats were injected intravenously with 2 × 106 recipient BMSCs on day 6, and with 0.2 mg/kg/day tacrolimus administered over 7 days (n = 6). In the FK group, recipient rats were treated with tacrolimus alone (n = 6). Rats in the UT group received no immunosuppressive treatment (n = 6). In the Iso group, transplantation was performed from three LEW donor rats to six LEW recipient rats without any immunosuppressive treatment (n = 6). Graft survival was assessed by daily inspection and histology. The immunological reactions of recipients were also evaluated. Results: The graft survival of recipient rats in the BMSC group (24.5 days) was significantly prolonged in comparison with that of the FK group (18 days) (P &lt;.01). Cytokine expression analysis of the skin of grafted limbs showed that BMSCs treatment significantly decreased IFN-γ mRNA expression of the BMSC group (0.138 ± 0.045) in comparison with that of the FK group (1.049 ± 0.167) (P =.0001). Recipient rats in the BMSC group had significantly reduced serum IFN-γ cytokine levels (1.571 ± 0.779 pg/ml) in comparison with that of the FK group (7.059 ± 1.522 pg/ml) (P =.001). In in vitro study, BMSCs induce T cell hyporesponsiveness in a mixed lymphocyte reaction. Conclusion: BMSCs induce T cell hyporesponsiveness and prolong graft survival in the rat vascularized composite allotransplantation model. BMSCs exhibit immunomodulatory properties against acute rejection that can be realized without the need for significant recipient immunosuppression. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",bone marrow-derived stromal cell; vascularized composite allotransplantation,"gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 2; messenger RNA; tacrolimus; cytokine; immunosuppressive agent; tacrolimus; acute graft versus host disease; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bone marrow stroma cell; bone marrow transplantation; cell differentiation; cell infiltration; controlled study; gene expression; graft recipient; graft survival; hindlimb; immunomodulation; immunosuppressive treatment; in vitro study; Lewis rat; male; mixed lymphocyte reaction; mononuclear cell; muscle biopsy; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; skin biopsy; vascularized composite allotransplantation; Wistar rat; animal; bone marrow transplantation; comparative study; disease model; graft rejection; graft survival; hindlimb; immunology; metabolism; multimodality cancer therapy; procedures; randomization; reference value; sensitivity and specificity; stroma cell; surgery; transplantation; transplantation tolerance; Animals; Bone Marrow Transplantation; Combined Modality Therapy; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Graft Rejection; Graft Survival; Hindlimb; Immunosuppressive Agents; Random Allocation; Rats; Rats, Inbred Lew; Rats, Wistar; Reference Values; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stromal Cells; Tacrolimus; Transplantation Tolerance",2-s2.0-85003037850

The deregulation of CDK9/P-TEFb has important implications for many cancer types. BAY 1143572 is a novel and highly selective CDK9/P-TEFb inhibitor currently being investigated in phase 1 studies. We evaluated the therapeutic potential of BAY 1143572 in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL). As a result of CDK9 inhibition and subsequent inhibition of phosphorylation at serine 2 of the RNAPII CTD, BAY 1143572 decreased c-Myc and Mcl-1 levels in ATL-derived or human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 (HTLV-1)–transformed lines and primary ATL cells tested, leading to their growth inhibition and apoptosis. Median inhibitory concentrations for BAY 1143572 in ATL-derived or HTLV-1–transformed lines (n 5 8), primary ATL cells (n 5 11), and CD41 cells from healthy volunteers (n 5 5) were 0.535, 0.30, and 0.36 mM, respectively. Next, NOG mice were used as recipients of tumor cells from an ATL patient. BAY 1143572–treated ATL-bearing mice (once daily 12.5 mg/kg oral application) demonstrated significantly decreased ATL cell infiltration of the liver and bone marrow, as well as decreased human soluble interleukin-2 receptor levels in serum (reflecting the ATL tumor burden), compared with untreated mice (n 5 8 for both). BAY 1143572–treated ATL-bearing mice demonstrated significantly prolonged survival compared with untreated ATL-bearing mice (n 5 7 for both). Collectively, this study indicates that BAY 1143572 showed strong potential as a novel treatment of ATL. ? 2017 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"bay 1143572; cyclin dependent kinase 9; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor; soluble interleukin 2 receptor; unclassified drug; cyclin dependent kinase 9; interleukin 2 receptor; protein kinase inhibitor; animal experiment; apoptosis assay; Article; cancer survival; carboxy terminal sequence; cell infiltration; cell proliferation assay; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; enzyme phosphorylation; female; flow cytometry; human; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; mouse; nonhuman; pharmacokinetic parameters; plasma protein binding; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; survival time; T cell leukemia; T cell lymphoma; Western blotting; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; apoptosis; bone marrow; cell proliferation; cell separation; drug effects; enzymology; Kaplan Meier method; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; liver; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; solubility; transformed cell line; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Bone Marrow; Cell Line, Transformed; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Separation; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 9; Human T-lymphotropic virus 1; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Liver; Mice; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Receptors, Interleukin-2; Signal Transduction; Solubility",2-s2.0-85028806159

Experimental Design: A total of 100 patients with PanNEN-G3 were collected from 31 institutions, and after central review characteristics of each histologic subtype [NET-G3 vs. pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (NEC-G3)] were analyzed, including clinical, radiological, and molecular features. Factors that correlate with response to chemotherapy and survival were assessed. Results: Seventy patients analyzed included 21 NETs-G3 (30%) and 49 NECs-G3 (70%). NET-G3 showed lower Ki67-labeling index (LI; median 28.5%), no abnormal Rb expression (0%), and no mutated KRAS (0%), whereas NEC-G3 showed higher Ki67-LI (median 80.0%), Rb loss (54.5%), and KRAS mutations (48.7%). Chemotherapy response rate (RR), platinum-based chemotherapy RR, and prognosis differed significantly between NET-G3 and NEC-G3. Chemotherapeutic outcomes were worse in NET-G3 (P < 0.001). When we stratified PanNEN-G3 with Rb and KRAS, PanNENs-G3 with Rb loss and those with mutated KRAS showed significantly higher RRs to platinum-based chemotherapy than those without (Rb loss, 80% vs. normal Rb, 24%, P = 0.006; mutated KRAS, 77% versus wild type, 23%, P = 0.023). Rb was a predictive marker of response to platinum-based chemotherapy even in NEC-G3 (P = 0.035). Conclusions: NET-G3 and NEC-G3 showed distinct clinicopathologic characteristics. Notably, NET-G3 does not respond to platinum-based chemotherapy. Rb and KRAS are promising predictors of response to platinum-based chemotherapy for PanNEN-G3, and Rb for NEC-G3. ?2017 AACR.",,"everolimus; Ki 67 antigen; platinum complex; antineoplastic agent; KRAS protein, human; platinum; protein p21; retinoblastoma protein; tumor marker; adenocarcinoma; adult; aged; antibody labeling; Article; bypass surgery; cancer chemotherapy; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; clinical feature; controlled study; drug response; female; gene expression; gene loss; gene mutation; human; human cell; human tissue; Japan; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; mutational analysis; oncogene K ras; pancreas islet cell tumor; priority journal; retrospective study; treatment outcome; tumor suppressor gene; Asian continental ancestry group; biosynthesis; cancer grading; clinical trial; drug effects; ethnology; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; mutation; neuroendocrine tumor; pancreas; pancreas tumor; pathology; prognosis; survival analysis; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biomarkers, Tumor; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Neoplasm Grading; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Pancreas; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Platinum; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins p21(ras); Retinoblastoma Protein; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-85028043603

However, because most lncRNAs are currently uncharacterized, the identification of novel oncogenic lncRNAs is difficult. Given that intergenic lncRNA have substantially less sequence conservation patterns than protein-coding genes across species, evolutionary conserved intergenic lncRNAs are likely to be functional. The current study identified a novel intergenic lncRNA, LINC00461 (ECONEXIN) using a combined approach consisting of searching lncRNAs by evolutionary conservation and validating their expression in a glioma mouse model. ECONEXIN was the most highly conserved intergenic lncRNA containing 83.0% homology with the mouse ortholog (C130071C03Rik) for a region over 2500 bp in length within its exon 3. Expressions of ECONEXIN and C130071C03Rik were significantly upregulated in both human and mouse glioma tissues. Moreover, the expression of C130071C03Rik was upregulated even in precancerous conditions and markedly increased during glioma progression. Functional analysis of ECONEXIN in glioma cell lines, U87 and U251, showed it was dominantly located in the cytoplasm and interacted with miR-411-5p via two binding sites within ECONEXIN. Inhibition of ECONEXIN upregulated miR-411-5p together with the downregulation of its target, Topoisomerase 2 alpha (TOP2A), in glioma cell lines, resulting in decreased cell proliferation. Our data demonstrated that ECONEXIN is a potential oncogene that regulates TOP2A by sponging miR-411-5p in glioma. In addition, our investigative approaches to identify conserved lncRNA and their molecular characterization by validation in mouse tumor models may be useful to functionally annotate novel lncRNAs, especially cancer-associated lncRNAs.",,"argonaute 2 protein; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing); econexin; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; unclassified drug; DNA binding protein; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing); DNA topoisomerase II alpha; ECONEXIN lncRNA, human; long untranslated RNA; microRNA; MIRN411 microRNA, human; RNA induced silencing complex; tumor antigen; animal tissue; Article; binding site; cancer growth; carcinogenesis; cell proliferation; cytoplasm; down regulation; exon; gene; gene expression; glioma cell line; gliomagenesis; human; human tissue; mouse; nonhuman; orthology; precancer; priority journal; RNA structure; upregulation; animal; brain tumor; carcinogenesis; conserved sequence; disease course; genetics; glioma; metabolism; oncogene; tumor cell line; Animals; Antigens, Neoplasm; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Conserved Sequence; Disease Progression; DNA Topoisomerases, Type II; DNA-Binding Proteins; Down-Regulation; Glioma; Humans; Mice; MicroRNAs; Oncogenes; Precancerous Conditions; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA-Induced Silencing Complex; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85016930374

Methods and results CVHR in night-time Holter ECG was detected by an automated algorithm, and the prognostic relationships of the frequency (FCV) and amplitude (ACV) of CVHR were examined in 717 patients after myocardial infarction (post-MI 1, 6% mortality, median follow-up 25 months). The predictive power was prospectively validated in three independent cohorts: a second group of 220 post-MI patients (post-MI 2, 25.5% mortality, follow-up 45 months); 299 patients with endstage renal disease on chronic haemodialysis (ESRD, 28.1% mortality, follow-up 85 months); and 100 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF, 35% mortality, follow-up 38 months). Although CVHR was observed in ?96% of the patients in all cohorts, FCV did not predict mortality in any cohort. In contrast, decreased ACV was a powerful predictor of mortality in the post-MI 1 cohort (hazard ratio [95% CI] per 1 ln [ms] decrement, 2.9 [2.2-3.7], P &lt; 0.001). This prognostic relationship was validated in the post-MI 2 (1.8 [1.4-2.2], P &lt; 0.001), ESRD (1.5 [1.3-1.8], P &lt; 0.001), and CHF (1.4 [1.1-1.8], P = 0.02) cohorts. The prognostic value of ACV was independent of age, gender, diabetes, b-blocker therapy, left ventricular ejection fraction, sleep-time mean R-R interval, and FCV. Conclusion Blunted CVHR detected by decreased ACV in a night-time Holter ECG predicts increased mortality risk in post-MI, ESRD, and CHF patients. ? 2017 The Author. European Society of Cardiology.

The Adherence Starts with Knowledge-12 (ASK-12) survey was developed to detect and address patient-specific barriers to medication adherence. Our objective is to investigate the clinical usefulness of the ASK-12 for assessing and addressing adherence to inhalation therapy in asthma. Methods: The ASK-12 was administered to 138 asthmatic patients. Using pharmacy-refill data, we examined the cut-offvalue of the ASK-12 to identify patients who were non-adherent to inhalation regimens and identify factors associated with non-adherence. To verify the usefulness of the ASK-12, inhalation regimens were prospectively switched to less-expensive and simpler (once-daily) dosing regimens in eight non-adherent asthmatic patients who reported specific-barriers in ""inconvenience of twice-daily inhaler use"" and ""cost"". Results: Valid responses were received from 114 (82.6%) patients. A significant correlation was found between pharmacy-refill rates and the ASK-12 total score (r=-0.55, P < 0.0001). The optimal cut-offvalue of the ASK-12 total score to discriminate non-adherent patients (defined by pharmacy-refill rate < 80%) was 23, with 71.4% specificity and 93.3% sensitivity. Using this value, 52 (45.6%) patients were classified as nonadherent. Univariate followed by multivariate analysis identified younger age as a predictor of non-adherence to inhalation regimens (odds ratio, 2.67; 95% CI, -0.95 to -0.06; P = 0.027). Switching inhaled medicines in eight patients resulted in significant improvements in both ASK-12 scores and asthma control. Conclusions: The ASK-12 is a brief, practical, and clinically useful measure for assessing and addressing adherence to inhalation regimens in asthma. ?

Postoperative pneumonia is a severe adverse event associated with esophageal cancer surgery. It is thought to be caused by aspiration of oropharyngeal fluid containing pathogens. However, the relationship between oral health status and postoperative pneumonia has not been well investigated. This study included 539 patients with esophageal cancer undergoing surgery at 1 of 7 university hospitals. While 306 patients received perioperative oral care, 233 did not. Various clinical factors as well as occurrence of postoperative pneumonia were retrospectively evaluated. Propensity-score matching was performed to minimize selection biases associated with comparison of retrospective data between the oral care and control groups. Factors related to postoperative pneumonia were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. Of the original 539 patients, 103 (19.1%) experienced postoperative pneumonia. The results of multivariate analysis of the 420 propensity score-matched patients revealed longer operation time, postoperative dysphagia, and lack of oral care intervention to be significantly correlated with postoperative pneumonia. The present findings demonstrate that perioperative oral care can reduce the risk of postoperative pneumonia in patients undergoing esophageal cancer surgery. Copyright ? 2017 the Author(s).

Methods: This prospective, randomized, open, blinded-endpoint study was conducted in 112 hospitals and clinics in Japan in 3000 subjects with both previous MI and IGT receiving voglibose (0.6?mg/day, n?=?424) or no drugs (n?=?435) for 2?years. The Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended discontinuation of the study in June 2012 after an interim analysis when the outcomes of 859 subjects were obtained. The primary endpoint was cardiovascular events including cardiovascular death, nonfatal MI, nonfatal unstable angina, nonfatal stroke, and percutaneous coronary intervention/coronary artery bypass graft. Secondary endpoints included individual components of the primary endpoint in addition to all-cause mortality and hospitalization due to heart failure. Results: The age, ratio of males, and HbA1C were 65 vs. 65?years, 86 vs. 87%, and 5.6 vs. 5.5% in the groups with and without voglibose, respectively. Voglibose improved IGT; however, Kaplan–Meier analysis showed no significant between-group difference with respect to cardiovascular events [12.5% with voglibose vs. 10.1% without voglibose for the primary endpoint (95% confidence interval, 0.82–1.86)]; there were no significant differences in secondary endpoints. Conclusion: Although voglibose effectively treated IGT, no additional benefits for cardiovascular events in patients with previous MI and IGT were observed. Voglibose may not be a contributing therapy to the secondary prevention in patients with MI and IGT.

HTN management is usually guided by brachial cuff blood pressure (BP), but questions have been raised regarding accuracy. Objectives This comprehensive analysis determined the accuracy of cuff BP and the consequent effect on BP classification compared with intra-arterial BP reference standards. Methods Three individual participant data meta-analyses were conducted among studies (from the 1950s to 2016) that measured intra-arterial aortic BP, intra-arterial brachial BP, and cuff BP. Results A total of 74 studies with 3,073 participants were included. Intra-arterial brachial systolic blood pressure (SBP) was higher than aortic values (8.0 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 5.9 to 10.1 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) and intra-arterial brachial diastolic BP was lower than aortic values (?1.0 mm Hg; 95% CI: ?2.0 to ?0.1 mm Hg; p = 0.038). Cuff BP underestimated intra-arterial brachial SBP (?5.7 mm Hg; 95% CI: ?8.0 to ?3.5 mm Hg; p < 0.0001) but overestimated intra-arterial diastolic BP (5.5 mm Hg; 95% CI: 3.5 to 7.5 mm Hg; p < 0.0001). Cuff and intra-arterial aortic SBP showed a small mean difference (0.3 mm Hg; 95% CI: ?1.5 to 2.1 mm Hg; p = 0.77) but poor agreement (mean absolute difference 8.0 mm Hg; 95% CI: 7.1 to 8.9 mm Hg). Concordance between BP classification using the Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure cuff BP (normal, pre-HTN, and HTN stages 1 and 2) compared with intra-arterial brachial BP was 60%, 50%, 53%, and 80%, and using intra-arterial aortic BP was 79%, 57%, 52%, and 76%, respectively. Using revised intra-arterial thresholds based on cuff BP percentile rank, concordance between BP classification using cuff BP compared with intra-arterial brachial BP was 71%, 66%, 52%, and 76%, and using intra-arterial aortic BP was 74%, 61%, 56%, and 65%, respectively.

The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between dental status and development of osteoradionecrosis. Study Design Multicenter, retrospective observational study. A total of 392 patients with head and neck cancer who underwent radiotherapy were investigated for correlations between the development of osteoradionecrosis and various factors. The cumulative occurrence rate of osteoradionecrosis was calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method and analyzed by Cox regression and log-rank test. Results Osteoradionecrosis developed in 30 of 392 patients. In 23 patients, osteoradionecrosis occurred in the mandibular molar region. A univariate analysis showed that oral or oropharyngeal cancer, jaw radiotherapy dose exceeding 50 Gy, periapical periodontitis, and tooth extraction after radiotherapy were significantly correlated with the occurrence of osteoradionecrosis. Among these, oral and oropharyngeal cancer, periapical periodontitis, and tooth extraction after radiotherapy were significant independent risk factors by multivariate analysis. Further, caries that occurred after radiotherapy and progressed rapidly, resulting in periapical periodontitis, carious stump, or extraction, was a major cause of osteoradionecrosis. Conclusion Extraction of mandibular molars with periapical periodontitis before radiotherapy and strict dental management after radiotherapy may reduce the risk of osteoradionecrosis. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"adult; aged; bone necrosis; clinical trial; complication; dental caries; female; head and neck tumor; human; male; middle aged; mouth hygiene; multicenter study; radiotherapy dosage; retrospective study; risk factor; tooth extraction; tooth periapical disease; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Dental Caries; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oral Hygiene; Osteoradionecrosis; Periapical Periodontitis; Radiotherapy Dosage; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tooth Extraction",2-s2.0-85020419948

Methods: Tests were conducted to detect aneuploidy in high-risk pregnant women, and adequate genetic counseling was provided. The clinical data, test results, and pregnancy outcomes were recorded. We discuss the problems of NIPT on the basis of published reports and meta-analyses. Results: From April 2013 to March 2016, 30 613 tests were conducted at 55 medical sites participating in a multicenter clinical study. Among the 30 613 women tested, 554 were positive (1.81%) and 30 021 were negative (98.1%) for aneuploidy. Of the 289, 128, and 44 women who tested positive for trisomies 21, 18, and 13, respectively, and underwent definitive testing, 279 (96.5%), 106 (82.8%), and 28 (63.6%) were determined to have a true-positive result. For the 13 481 women with negative result and whose progress could be traced, two had a false-negative result (0.02%). The tests were performed on the condition that a standard level of genetic counseling be provided at hospitals. Conclusion: Here, we report on the 3-year nationwide experience with NIPT in Japan. It is important to establish a genetic counseling system to enable women to make informed decisions regarding prenatal testing. Moreover, a welfare system is warranted to support women who decide to give birth to and raise children with chromosomal diseases. ? 2017 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology",aneuploidy; Down syndrome; fetus; genetic counseling; trisomy,adult; aneuploidy; Article; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; false negative result; female; genetic counseling; high risk pregnancy; human; Japan; karyotype; major clinical study; maternal plasma; multicenter study; non invasive procedure; predictive value; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal care; sensitivity and specificity; trisomy 13; trisomy 18; trisomy 21; aneuploidy; ethics; maternal serum screening test; pregnancy; procedures; trends; Aneuploidy; Female; Genetic Counseling; Humans; Japan; Maternal Serum Screening Tests; Pregnancy,2-s2.0-85020216232

However, we recently showed that the serine/threonine kinase PDPK1 and its substrate RPS6KA3 (also termed RSK2) are universally active in MM, and play pivotal roles in myeloma pathophysiology. In this study, we assessed involvement of aberrant miR-375 repression in PDPK1 overexpression in MM. An analysis of plasma cells from 30 pre-malignant monoclonal gammopathies of undetermined significance and 73 MM patients showed a significant decrease in miR-375 expression in patient-derived plasma cells regardless of the clinical stage, compared to normal plasma cells. Introduction of miR-375 reduced PDPK1 expression in human myeloma cell lines (HMCLs), indicating that miR-375 is the dominant regulator of PDPK1 expression. In addition, miR-375 introduction also downregulated IGF1R and JAK2 in HMCLs. CpG islands in the MIR375 promoter were pathologically hypermethylated in all 8 HMCLs examined and in most of 58 patient-derived myeloma cells. Treatment with SGI-110, a hypomethylating agent, and/or trichostatin A, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, increased miR-375 expression, but repressed PDPK1, IGF1R and JAK2 in HMCLs. Collectively, these results show the universal involvement of overlapping epigenetic dysregulation for abnormal miR-375 repression in MM, which is likely to contribute to myelomagenesis and to subsequent myeloma progression by activating oncogenic signalling pathways. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",epigenetics; microRNA; miR-375; multiple myeloma; PDPK1,"guadecitabine; Janus kinase 2; microRNA 375; phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1; protein RPS6KA3; protein serine threonine kinase; somatomedin C receptor; trichostatin A; unclassified drug; 3 phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase; microRNA; MIRN375 microRNA, human; PDPK1 protein, human; ribosomal protein S6 kinase, 90kDa, polypeptide 3; S6 kinase; SDC1 protein, human; syndecan 1; tumor protein; Article; carcinogenesis; controlled study; CpG island; down regulation; enzyme activation; epigenetic repression; human; human cell; major clinical study; MIR375 gene; monoclonal immunoglobulinemia; multiple myeloma; multiple myeloma cell line; plasma cell; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; biosynthesis; blood; DNA methylation; epigenetic repression; genetic epigenesis; genetics; metabolism; multiple myeloma; recurrent disease; signal transduction; tumor cell line; 3-Phosphoinositide-Dependent Protein Kinases; Cell Line, Tumor; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenetic Repression; Humans; MicroRNAs; Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance; Multiple Myeloma; Neoplasm Proteins; Plasma Cells; Recurrence; Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 90-kDa; Signal Transduction; Syndecan-1",2-s2.0-85018831698

Objective: To identify genetic markers of asthma exacerbations, particularly in patients with type-2 inflammatory endotype. Methods: In this observational study of patients enrolled in the Kinki Hokuriku Airway disease Conference multicenter study, frequency of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids during 2?years after enrolment and associated risk factors was determined. For genetic marker analysis, interleukin-4 receptor α (IL4RA) rs8832 and a disintegrin and metalloprotease 33 (ADAM33) S_2 (rs528557), T_1 (rs2280091), T_2 (rs2280090), and V_4 (rs2787094) variants were included. Elevated serum periostin levels at enrolment (?95?ng/mL, defined as type-2 inflammatory endotype) were considered in the analysis. Results: Among 217 patients who were successfully followed up for 2?years after enrolment, 60 patients showed at least one asthma exacerbation during the 2?years. Airflow limitation (%FEV1 &lt;80%) and recent exacerbations but not genetic variants were identified as risk markers of exacerbations. A total of 27 patients showed type-2 inflammatory endotype (serum periostin ?95?ng/mL at enrolment) and subsequent exacerbations; risk factors in these patients were airflow limitation (odds ratio, 6.51; 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.37–18.6; P=.0003), GG genotype of IL4RA rs8832 (odds ratio, 4.01; 95% CI: 1.47–11.0; P=.007), and A allele of ADAM33 T_2 (odds ratio, 2.81; 95% CI: 1.05–7.67; P=.04) by multivariate analysis. In addition, GG genotype of IL4RA rs8832 was associated with type-2 endotype, whereas A allele of ADAM33 T_2 was associated with mixed type of eosinophilic/type-2 and neutrophilic inflammations. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance: IL4RA and ADAM33 variants may be risk markers of asthma exacerbations in type-2 inflammatory endotype.

We recommend a minimally traumatic extraction technique, removal of any bone edges, and mucosal wound closure as standard procedures in patients receiving bisphosphonates. Introduction: Osteonecrosis of the jaws can occur following tooth extraction in patients receiving bisphosphonate drugs. Various strategies for minimizing the risk of MRONJ have been advanced, but no studies have comprehensively analyzed the efficacy of factors such as primary wound closure, demographics, and drug holidays in reducing its incidence. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the relationships between these various risk factors after tooth extraction in patients receiving oral bisphosphonate therapy. Methods: Risk factors for MRONJ after tooth extraction were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. All patients were investigated with regard to demographics; type and duration of oral bisphosphonate use; whether they underwent a discontinuation of oral bisphosphonates before tooth extraction (drug holiday), and the duration of such discontinuation; and whether any additional surgical procedures (e.g., incision, removal of bone edges, root amputation) were performed. Results: We found that root amputation (OR?=?6.64), extraction of a single tooth (OR?=?3.70), bone loss or severe tooth mobility (OR?=?3.60), and an unclosed wound (OR?=?2.51) were significantly associated with increased risk of developing MRONJ. Conclusions: We recommend a minimally traumatic extraction technique, removal of any bone edges, and mucosal wound closure as standard procedures in patients receiving bisphosphonates. We find no evidence supporting the efficacy of a pre-extraction short-term drug holiday from oral bisphosphonates in reducing the risk of MRONJ. ? 2017, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Antibiotics administration; BRONJ; Discontinuation; Primary closure; Surgical procedure,"bisphosphonic acid derivative; bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; adult; aged; amputation; Article; cohort analysis; disease course; disease severity; female; human; jaw osteonecrosis; major clinical study; male; medication related osteonecrosis of the jaw; multicenter study; osteolysis; pathogenesis; periodontal disease; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; root amputation; tooth extraction; validation study; wound closure; clinical trial; drug administration; jaw osteonecrosis; middle aged; oral drug administration; procedures; risk factor; tooth extraction; treatment withdrawal; very elderly; wound healing; young adult; Administration, Oral; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diphosphonates; Drug Administration Schedule; Humans; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tooth Extraction; Withholding Treatment; Wound Closure Techniques; Wound Healing; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85018354696

Coats plus syndrome is also characterized by the same neuroradiological findings together with defects in retinal vascular development. Indeed, LCC and Coats plus were originally considered to be the same clinical entity termed cerebroretinal microangiopathy with calcifications and cysts, but evidence suggests that they are genetically distinct. Mutations in CTS telomere maintenance complex component 1 (CTC1) and small nucleolar RNA, C/D box 118 (SNORD118) genes have been found to cause Coats plus and LCC, respectively. Materials and Methods: Eight unrelated families with LCC were recruited. These patients typically showed major neuroradiological findings of LCC with no signs of extra-neurological manifestations such as retinal abnormality, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hematological abnormalities. SNORD118 was examined by Sanger sequencing in these families. Results: Seven out of eight probands carry compound heterozygous mutations, suggesting that SNORD118 mutations are the major cause of LCC. We identified a total of eight mutation, including four that were novel. Some of the variants identified in this study present heterozygously in public databases with an extremely rare frequency (<0.1%).

We investigated HBV reactivation using high sensitivity HB surface antigen (HBsAg) chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (HBsAg-HQ) and ultra-high sensitive HBsAg assay employing a semi-automated immune complex transfer chemiluminescence enzyme technique (ICT-CLEIA). Methods: Of 120 HBV-resolved patients with haematological malignancy receiving systemic chemotherapy from 2012 to 2015 in our hospital, 13 patients had HBV DNA reactivation (in 12/13 patients HBV DNA became quantifiable) according to HBV DNA monitoring. These patients were applied for Architect HBsAg-QT (detection limit:50?mIU/mL), HBsAg-HQ (5?mIU/mL) and ICT-CLEIA (0.5?mIU/mL) using stored samples. Results: When HBV DNA was firstly quantifiable by regular HBV DNA monitoring, HBsAg-QT was detected in 1/12 patients (8%), HBsAg-HQ was detected in 4/12 patients (33%) and ICT-CLEIA was detected in all 12 patients (100%), suggesting that the sensitivity of ICT-CLEIA was comparable to that of HBV DNA quantification. Interestingly, two patients were HBsAg positive by ICT-CLEIA before HBV DNA became detectable. Median difference of detectable point between HBV DNA and ICT-CLEIA was zero (range from ?28 to 56?days), while median delay by HBsAg-QT or HBsAg-HQ was 52.5?days after HBV DNA became detectable.

The aim of this study was to validate the effect of MST on AIP administered in accordance with the 2010 Japanese consensus guidelines. Methods: The clinical data of patients with (n?=?510) from 22 high-volume centers in Japan were studied. The primary endpoints were the relapse rates (RRs) in patients administered MST versus those not administered MST. The secondary endpoints were the optimal dose and duration of MST in terms of steroid toxicity and the predictors of relapse. Results: The RRs were 10.0% within 1?year, 25.8% within 3?years and 35.1% within 5?years. The RR in the steroid therapy group reached a plateau at 42.7% at 7?years. In terms of the optimal dosage, the overall RR in the MST 5?mg/day group was 26.1%, which was significantly lower than that in the group which had discontinued steroid therapy (45.2%; p?=?0.023) or was receiving MST at 2.5?mg/day (43.4%, p?=?0.001). The RRs in the group receiving MST at ?5?mg/day versus the patient group receiving MST at <5?mg/day were 10.6 vs. 10.3% within 1?year, 23.5 vs. 32.9% within 3?years and 32.2 vs. 41.3% within 5?years, respectively (log-rank, p?=?0.028). The best cutoff value of the total steroid dose for serious steroid toxicity was 6405?mg, with a moderate accuracy of 0.717 determined using the area under the curve.

Conclusions: The RR could continue to increase for 7?years even under MST. Based on our analysis of the side effects of steroid therapy, MST at 5?mg/day for 2 (total 4625?mg) to 3 (total 6425?mg)?years might be a rational and safe therapeutic strategy in terms of keeping the RR to <30% while avoiding potential steroid toxicity. ? 2017, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Autoimmune pancreatitis; Maintenance steroid treatment; Relapse rate; Steroid toxicity,"azathioprine; prednisolone; antiinflammatory agent; azathioprine; immunosuppressive agent; prednisolone; aged; Article; atherosclerosis; autoimmune pancreatitis; avascular necrosis; bacterial infection; brain infarction; compression fracture; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; corticosteroid induced myopathy; dacryocystitis; drug withdrawal; female; human; Japanese (people); jaundice; liver dysfunction; low drug dose; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; mycosis; optimal drug dose; osteoporosis; pancreas disease; priority journal; recurrence risk; retroperitoneal fibrosis; sclerosing cholangitis; sialoadenitis; steroid therapy; swelling; autoimmune disease; chronic pancreatitis; clinical trial; immunology; Japan; maintenance chemotherapy; middle aged; recurrent disease; risk factor; secondary prevention; time factor; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Autoimmune Diseases; Azathioprine; Female; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Japan; Maintenance Chemotherapy; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Prednisolone; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Secondary Prevention; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85008470455

METHODS Japanese patients with predominant GERD symptoms recruited accorDing to the Montreal definition were treated for 4 wk using a standard dose of proton pump inhibitor (PPI). The GERD-TEST and the MeDical Outcome Study Short Form-8 Health Survey (SF-8) were administered at baseline and after 4 wk of treatment. The GERD-TEST contains three domains: the severity of GERD and functional dyspepsia (FD) symptoms (5 items), the level of Dissatisfaction with daily life (DS) (4 items), and the therapeutic efficacy as assessed by the patients and meDication compliance (4 items). RESULTS A total of 290 patients were eligible at baseline; 198 of these patients completed 4 wk of PPI therapy. The internal consistency reliability as evaluated using the Cronbach's ? values for the GERD, FD and DS subscales ranged from 0.75 to 0.82. The scores for the GERD, FD and DS items/subscales were significantly correlated with the physical and mental component summary scores of the SF-8. After 4 wk of PPI treatment, the scores for the GERD items/subscales were greatly reduced, ranging in value from 1.51 to 1.87 and with a large effect size (P < 0.0001, Cohen's d ; 1.29-1.63). Statistically significant Differences in the changes in the scores for the GERD items/subscales were observed between treatment responders and non-responders (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION The GERD-TEST has a good reliability, a good convergent and concurrent valiDity, and is responsive to the effects of treatment. The GERD-TEST is a simple, easy to understand, and multifaceted PRO instrument applicable to both clinical trials and the primary care of GERD patients. ?

Surprisingly, recent work has shown that B1 cells remain largely quiescent. They are reactivated postnatally to function as primary progenitors for neurons destined for the olfactory bulb and some corpus callosum oligodendrocytes. The cellular and molecular properties of quiescent B1 cells remain unknown. Here we found that a subpopulation of B1 cells has a unique nuclear envelope invagination specialization similar to envelope-limited chromatin sheets (ELCS), reported in certain lymphocytes and some cancer cells. Using molecular markers, [3H]thymidine birth-dating, and Ara-C, we found that B1 cells with ELCS correspond to quiescent NSCs. ELCS begin forming in embryonic radial glia cells and represent a specific nuclear compartment containing particular epigenetic modifications and telomeres. These results reveal a unique nuclear compartment in quiescent NSCs, which is useful for identifying these primary progenitors and study their gene regulation. ? 2017 The Author(s)",neural stem cells; nuclear ELCS; nuclear envelope invaginations; quiescence; V-SVZ,"cytarabine; adult; animal cell; Article; astrocyte; cell nucleus membrane; cell specificity; cell subpopulation; chromatin; controlled study; embryo; epigenetics; gene control; lymphocyte; mouse; neural stem cell; nonhuman; perinatal period; priority journal; adult stem cell; animal; cell culture; cell cycle; cell nucleus membrane; chemistry; cytology; lateral brain ventricle; neural stem cell; ultrastructure; Adult Stem Cells; Animals; Astrocytes; Cell Cycle; Cells, Cultured; Chromatin; Lateral Ventricles; Mice; Neural Stem Cells; Nuclear Envelope",2-s2.0-85021127923

Between August 2011 and January 2015, 152 patients were treated using two-beam TD-IMRT with 50 Gy/25 fractions. Among them, 20 patients with left-sided breast cancer were randomly chosen, and two-beam TD-IMRT, TD-3DCRT and 3DCRT plans were created for each patient. The homogeneity and conformity indices and various dose-volume parameters for the planning target volume and OARs were evaluated. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at 3 years. Toxicities were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. TD-IMRT and TD-3DCRT showed better whole-breast coverage than 3DCRT (P < 0.001). Most of the mean values of dosimetric endpoints for OARs were better in TD-IMRT than in TD-3DCRT and 3DCRT. Overall survival rates were 97.7% and local control rates were 99.1% at 3 years. Regional control and distant metastasis control rates at 3 years were 98.6% and 96.8%, respectively. Twenty-four of the 152 patients had Grade 2 or higher acute radiation dermatitis. Four patients (4/146 = 2.7%) had Grade 2 radiation pneumonitis. There were no late adverse events of Grade 2 or higher. Two-beam TD-IMRT appeared to yield better dose distribution for whole-breast external-beam radiation therapy than TD-3DCRT and two-beam 3DCRT. The treatment appeared to provide low skin toxicity and acceptable tumor control. ? 2017 The Author.

This study aimed to analyze the relationship between D-index and oral complications (i.e., oral mucositis [OM] and odontogenic infection [OI]) during chemotherapies for hematological malignancies. Methods: A total of 421 chemotherapeutic courses in 104 patients were analyzed. Chemotherapeutic courses in patients who finished all of the prophylactic dental treatments were defined as “treatment Finish”. Chemotherapeutic courses in patients who did not finish prophylactic dental treatments were defined as “treatment not-Finish”. OM was evaluated according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. D-index was compared between chemotherapeutic courses with versus without oral complications. Results: D-index was significantly higher in chemotherapeutic courses with grade 1 or 2 OM (p < 0.001) than courses without OM. In contrast, higher D-index did not relate to the development of OI (p = 0.18). The occurrence of OI (p < 0.001) but not OM (p = 0.56) during chemotherapy was significantly higher in chemotherapeutic courses without the completion of dental intervention. Conclusions: Higher D-index relates to the development of OM. In contrast, OI occurs due to untreated odontogenic foci, and its occurrence does not relate to higher D-index. ? 2017 Kishimoto et al.

However, the physiological function of ABCA7 and its transport substrates remain unclear. Immunohistochemical analyses of human brain sections from AD and non-AD subjects revealed that ABCA7 is expressed in neuron and microglia cells in the cerebral cortex. The transport substrates and acceptors were identified in BHK/ABCA7 cells and compared with those of ABCA1. Like ABCA1, ABCA7 exported choline phospholipids in the presence of apoA-I and apoE; however, unlike ABCA1, cholesterol efflux was marginal. Lipid efflux by ABCA7 was saturated by 5 μg/ml apoA-I and was not dependent on apoE isoforms, whereas efflux by ABCA1 was dependent on apoA-I up to 20 μg/ml and apoE isoforms. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analyses revealed that the two proteins had different preferences for phospholipid export: ABCA7 preferred phosphatidylcholine (PC) ? lysoPC > sphingomyelin (SM) = phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), whereas ABCA1 preferred PC > > SM > PE = lysoPC. The major difference in the pattern of lipid peaks between ABCA7 and ABCA1 was the high lysoPC/PC ratio of ABCA7. These results suggest that lysoPC is one of the major transport substrates for ABCA7 and that lysoPC export may be a physiologically important function of ABCA7 in the brain. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",ABC proteins; ABCA1; ABCA7; Alzheimer's disease; Lysophosphatidylcholine,"ABC transporter; ABC transporter A1; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein E; ATP binding cassette transporter A7; choline; lysophosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; sphingomyelin; unclassified drug; ABC transporter; ABC transporter A1; ABCA7 protein, human; apolipoprotein A1; apolipoprotein E; cholesterol; lysophosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylcholine; phosphatidylethanolamine; phospholipid; sphingomyelin; Alzheimer disease; animal cell; Article; brain cortex; cholesterol transport; controlled study; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; microglia; nonhuman; pathogenesis; phospholipid transfer; priority journal; protein expression; protein lipid interaction; Alzheimer disease; animal; cell line; hamster; HEK293 cell line; lipid metabolism; metabolism; physiology; transport at the cellular level; Alzheimer Disease; Animals; Apolipoprotein A-I; Apolipoproteins E; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Biological Transport; Cell Line; Cholesterol; Cricetinae; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lysophosphatidylcholines; Phosphatidylcholines; Phosphatidylethanolamines; Phospholipids; Sphingomyelins",2-s2.0-85018519942

Patients and Methods The records of 264 patients receiving antiplatelet therapy who underwent tooth extraction were retrospectively reviewed from 6 institutions belonging to the Japanese Study Group of Cooperative Dentistry with Medicine. Demographic information, hemorrhage events after tooth extraction, the presence or absence of comorbidities, antiplatelet agent, the use of preoperative antibiotics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, number of teeth extracted, serum creatinine level, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and alanine transaminase level were assessed. Risk factors for hemorrhage after tooth extraction were evaluated by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results The study population of 264 patients consisted of 153 men and 111 women with a mean age of 73.6 years (range, 24 to 96 yr). Six hundred ninety-four teeth were extracted (mean, 2.6 ± 2.3 teeth per patient). In patients receiving antiplatelet therapy, the frequency of hemorrhage after tooth extraction, including mild and self-controlled hemorrhages, was 17.4%. Univariate analysis showed that serum creatinine level and dual antiplatelet therapy were correlated with hemorrhage after tooth extraction (P =.001 and P =.049, respectively). Only serum creatinine was identified as an independent risk factor for hemorrhage after tooth extraction in patients receiving antiplatelet therapy (P =.037). Conclusions The risk of hemorrhage after tooth extraction is increased in patients receiving dual antiplatelet therapy with or without chronic kidney disease. Local hemostatic treatments, such as at least suturing, are recommended. ? 2017 American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons",,"acetylsalicylic acid; alanine aminotransferase; antibiotic agent; cilostazol; clopidogrel; creatinine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; antithrombocytic agent; adult; aged; Article; bleeding; creatinine blood level; dual antiplatelet therapy; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; maintenance drug dose; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; retrospective study; risk factor; tooth extraction; adverse effects; clinical trial; middle aged; postoperative hemorrhage; tooth extraction; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; Postoperative Hemorrhage; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tooth Extraction; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85017429002

The identification of severe type-2/eosinophilic asthma is important for improving the management of patients with asthma. Therefore, efforts to develop non-invasive biomarkers for type-2/eosinophilic airway inflammation have been made during this decade. Currently, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and serum periostin levels are considered markers of type-2/eosinophilic inflammation in asthma. However, a single-marker approach has limited the ability to diagnose severe type-2/eosinophilic asthma accurately and predict disease outcomes precisely. The present article reviews the utility of FeNO and serum periostin levels in a single-marker approach and in a multiple-marker approach in identifying patients with severe type-2/eosinophilic asthma. Furthermore, based on a sub-analysis of the Kinki Hokuriku Airway disease Conference (KiHAC), geno-endo-phenotypes of patients were stratified into four groups according to the FeNO and serum periostin levels. ? 2017 Japanese Society of Allergology",Asthma; Composite marker; Nitric oxide; Serum periostin; Type-2/eosinophilic inflammation,"nitric oxide; transcription factor RUNX2; biological marker; cell adhesion molecule; nitric oxide; POSTN protein, human; asthma; comparative study; disease severity; eosinophilia; expired air; human; prediction; priority journal; protein blood level; Review; serum; animal; asthma; blood; breath analysis; disease exacerbation; disease management; eosinophil; exhalation; immunology; lung function test; metabolism; pathology; prognosis; Animals; Asthma; Biomarkers; Breath Tests; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Disease Management; Disease Progression; Eosinophils; Exhalation; Humans; Nitric Oxide; Prognosis; Respiratory Function Tests",2-s2.0-85014014177

However, sustained UPR activation has negative effects on cellular functions and may worsen disease symptoms. It remains unknown whether and how UPR components can be utilized to counteract chronic ER proteinopathies. We found that promotion of ER-associated degradation (ERAD) through upregulation of ERAD-enhancing α-mannosidase-like proteins (EDEMs) protected against chronic ER proteinopathy without inducing toxicity in a Drosophila model. ERAD activity in the brain decreased with aging, and upregulation of EDEMs suppressed age-dependent behavioral decline and extended the lifespan without affecting the UPR gene expression network. Intriguingly, EDEM mannosidase activity was dispensable for these protective effects. Therefore, upregulation of EDEM function in the ERAD protects against ER proteinopathy in vivo and thus represents a potential therapeutic target for chronic diseases. The unfolded protein response (UPR) protects cells against ER stress, but sustained UPR activation is detrimental. Sekiya et al. found that upregulation of EDEM function in ERAD protected against ER proteinopathy and age-related physiological declines in Drosophila without UPR induction and may represent a potential therapeutic target for chronic diseases. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",aging; Drosophila; EDEMs; ER stress; ER-associated degradation; ERAD; ERAD-enhancing α-mannosidase-like proteins; neurodegeneration; protein misfolding; unfolded protein response; UPR,alpha 1 antitrypsin; alpha mannosidase; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; chaperone; dEDEM1 protein; dEDEM2 protein; E123Q protein; E144Q protein; endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation alpha mannosidase like protein; histone deacetylase; preproenkephalin; proteasome; protein; protein IRE1; tau protein; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; X box binding protein 1; glycoprotein; membrane protein; aging; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; behavior change; brain disease; brain tissue; brain toxicity; chronic disease; controlled study; cytotoxicity; disorders of amino acid and protein metabolism; Drosophila; endoplasmic reticulum; endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; endoplasmic reticulum proteinopathy; enzyme activity; gene expression; human; in vivo study; lifespan; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; physiological process; priority journal; protein function; signal transduction; unfolded protein response; upregulation; animal; cell line; Drosophila melanogaster; endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation; metabolism; physiology; protein folding; Animals; Cell Line; Drosophila melanogaster; Endoplasmic Reticulum; Endoplasmic Reticulum-Associated Degradation; Gene Expression; Glycoproteins; Membrane Proteins; Protein Folding,2-s2.0-85029379165

Angiogenesis, neovascularization from existing blood vessel, is essential for tissue growth and repair. Proangiogenic therapy for stroke is promising for preventing excess neuron death and improving functional recovery. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a critical factor for angiogenesis by promoting the proliferation, the survival, and the migration of endothelial cells. Here, angiogenic biomaterials to support injured brain regeneration are developed. Porous laminin (LN)-rich sponge (LN-sponge), on which histidine-tagged VEGF (VEGF-Histag) is immobilized via affinity interaction is developed. In an in vivo mouse stroke model, transplanting VEGF-Histag-LN-sponge produces remarkably stronger angiogenic activity than transplanting LN-sponge with soluble VEGF. The findings indicate that using affinity interactions to immobilize VEGF is a practical approach for developing angiogenic biomaterials for regenerating the injured brain. ? 2017 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, as this model is very costly and difficult to use because of ethical and animal welfare issues, we aimed to establish the tupaia (Tupaia belangeri) as a new model for HBV infection and characterized its intrahepatic innate immune response upon HBV infection. First, we compared the propagation of HBV genotypes A2 and C in vivo in tupaia hepatocytes. At 8–10?days post infection (dpi), the level of HBV-A2 propagation in the tupaia liver was found to be higher than that of HBV-C. Abnormal architecture of liver cell cords and mitotic figures were also observed at 8 dpi with HBV-A2. Moreover, we found that HBV-A2 established chronic infection in some tupaias. We then aimed to characterize the intrahepatic innate immune response in this model. First, we infected six tupaias with HBV-A2 (strains JP1 and JP4). At 28 dpi, intrahepatic HBV-DNA and serum hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAg) were detected in all tupaias. The levels of interferon (IFN)-β were found to be significantly suppressed in the three tupaias infected with HBV A2_JP4, while no significant change was observed in the three infected with HBV A2_JP1. Expression of toll-like receptor (TLR) 1 was suppressed, while that of TLR3 and TLR9 were induced, in HBV A2_JP1-infected tupaias. Expression of TLR8 was induced in all tupaias. Next, we infected nine tupaias with HBV-A2 (JP1, JP2, and JP4), and characterized the infected animals after 31 weeks. Serum HBsAg levels were detected at 31 weeks post-infection (wpi) and IFN-β was found to be significantly suppressed in all tupaias. TLR3 was not induced, except in tupaia #93 and #96. Suppression of TLR9 was observed in all tupaias, except tupaia #93. Also, we investigated the expression levels of cyclic GMP-AMP synthase, which was found to be induced in all tupaias at 28 dpi and in four tupaias at 31 wpi. Additionally, we evaluated the expression levels of sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide, which was found to be suppressed during chronic HBV infection. Thus, the tupaia infection model of HBV clearly indicated the suppression of IFN-β at 31 wpi, which might have contributed to the establishment of chronic HBV infection. ? 2017 The Authors",Chronic infection; Hepatitis B virus; Interferon; Toll-like receptors; Tupaia,"beta interferon; cyclic GMP; hepatitis B surface antigen; polypeptide; sodium bile acid cotransporter; synthetase; toll like receptor 1; toll like receptor 3; toll like receptor 8; toll like receptor 9; beta interferon; hepatitis B surface antigen; toll like receptor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; gene expression; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype A; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; immune response; infection sensitivity; innate immunity; liver cell; mitosis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Tupaia belangeri; virus replication; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; blood; chronic hepatitis B; disease model; gene expression profiling; Hepatitis B virus; host pathogen interaction; immune evasion; immunology; innate immunity; pathology; Tupaia; virology; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Profiling; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Hepatocytes; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Immune Evasion; Immunity, Innate; Interferon-beta; Toll-Like Receptors; Tupaia; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-85019755272

However, the sympathetic nervous system and intrarenal dopaminergic system can also contribute to renal sodium handling. A total of 20 patients with chronic kidney disease (61?±?15?years) underwent 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring before and during two-day treatment with ARB, azilsartan. Urinary angiotensinogen excretion rate (UAGTV, μg/gCre) was measured as intrarenal RAAS; urinary dopamine excretion rate (UDAV, pg/gCre) as intrarenal dopaminergic system; heart rate variabilities (HRV, calculated from 24-h Holter-ECG) of non-Gaussianity index λ25s as sympathetic nerve activity; and power of high-frequency (HF) component or deceleration capacity (DC) as parasympathetic nerve activity. At baseline, glomerular filtration rate correlated inversely with UAGTV (r?=??0.47, P?=?0.04) and positively with UDAV (r?=?0.58, P?=?0.009). HF was a determinant of night/day BP ratio (β?=??0.50, F?=?5.8), rather than DC or λ25s. During the acute phase of ARB treatment, a lower steady sodium balance was not achieved. Increase in daytime UN aV preceded restoration of BP rhythm, accompanied by decreased UAGTV (r?=??0.88, P?=?0.05) and increased UDAV (r?=?0.87, P?=?0.05), but with no changes in HRVs. Diminished sodium excretion can cause nondipper BP rhythm. This was attributable to intrarenal RAAS and dopaminergic system and impaired parasympathetic nerve activity. During the acute phase of ARB treatment, cooperative effects of ARB and intrarenal dopaminergic system exert natriuresis to restore circadian BP rhythm. ? 2017 The Authors.

Herein, we evaluated the effects of photodynamic therapy (PDT) with maltotriose-conjugated chlorin (Mal3-chlorin) in culture and in a peritoneal disseminated mice model of pancreatic cancer. The Mal3-chlorin was prepared as a water-soluble chlorin derivative conjugated with four Mal3 molecules to improve cancer selectivity. In vitro, Mal3-chlorin showed superior uptake into pancreatic cancer cells compared with talaporfin, which is clinically used. Moreover, the strong cytotoxic effects of PDT with Mal3-chlorin occurred via apoptosis and reactive oxygen species generation, whereas Mal3-chlorin alone did not cause any cytotoxicity in pancreatic cancer cells. Notably, using a peritoneal disseminated mice model, we demonstrated that Mal3-chlorin accumulated in xenograft tumors and suppressed both tumor growth and ascites formation with PDT. Furthermore, PDT with Mal3- chlorin induced robust apoptosis in peritoneal disseminated tumors, as indicated by immunohistochemistry. Taken together, these findings implicate Mal3-chlorin as a potential nextgeneration photosensitizer for PDT and the basis of a new strategy for managing peritoneal dissemination of pancreatic cancer. ?2017 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"5,10,15,20 tetrakis [4 (beta dextro maltotriosylthio) 2,3,5,6 tetrafluorophenyl] 2,3 [methano (n methyl)iminomethano]chlorin; caspase 3; caspase 7; maltotriose; photosensitizing agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; talaporfin; unclassified drug; caspase; chlorin; maltotriose; photosensitizing agent; porphyrin; reactive oxygen metabolite; trisaccharide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; ascites; cancer inhibition; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; disseminated cancer; drug accumulation; drug conjugation; drug efficacy; female; fluorescence imaging; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; pancreatic cancer cell line; peritoneal dissemination; peritoneum tumor; photocytotoxicity; photodynamic therapy; priority journal; tissue culture; tumor growth; tumor xenograft; animal; cell survival; chemical structure; chemistry; disease model; drug effects; drug screening; metabolism; pancreas tumor; pathology; peritoneum tumor; photochemotherapy; radiation response; secondary; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Caspases; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Humans; Mice; Molecular Structure; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Peritoneal Neoplasms; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Porphyrins; Reactive Oxygen Species; Trisaccharides; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85020543503

Much recent research has focused on the treatment of brain diseases through neuronal regeneration with endogenously generated neurons. In the adult brain, immature neurons called neuroblasts are continuously generated in the ventricular-subventricular zone (V-SVZ). These neuroblasts migrate rapidly through the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb, where they mature and are integrated into the neuronal circuitry. After brain insult, some of the neuroblasts in the V-SVZ migrate toward the lesion to repopulate the injured tissue. This notable migratory capacity of V-SVZ-derived neuroblasts is important for efficiently regenerating neurons in remote areas of the brain. As these neurons migrate for long distances through adult brain tissue, they are supported by various guidance cues and structures that act as scaffolds. Some of these mechanisms are unique to neuroblast migration in the adult brain, and are not involved in migration in the developing brain. Here, we review the latest findings on the mechanisms of neuroblast migration in the adult brain under physiological and pathological conditions, and discuss various issues that still need to be resolved.

Material and methods This retrospective study included 43 patients with BOTs and 43 patients with stage I MEOTs who underwent contrast-enhanced MRI with DWI and CA-125 analysis. Two radiologists evaluated the MRI findings in consensus. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to detect the best predictor variables for MEOTs. Results Mixed cystic/solid and predominantly solid appearances, as well as thickened irregular septa, were more frequent in MEOTs. A papillary architecture and internal branching (PA&amp;IB) pattern was more frequent in BOTs. MEOTs had thicker walls and septa, larger solid components, and higher CA-125 values. The mean ADC value of solid components (ADCmean) and minimum ADC value of whole lesions (ADCmin) were lower in MEOTs.

The resulting data were compared with that obtained in an earlier survey, conducted in 2010. Seven main organisms were collected, and 883 isolates were studied. A significant reduction in methicillin resistance was observed among Staphylococcus aureus isolates, dropping from 72.5% in 2010 to 53.8% in 2014–2015 (p?<?0.001). MRSA isolates with a vancomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2?μg/mL accounted for 1.2% of all MRSA isolates, which was significantly lower than in 2010 (9.7%, p?=?0.029). Of the Escherichia coli isolates, 23.0% produced an extended spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) in the 2014–2015 survey, which was a significant increase from 9.5% in 2010 (p?=?0.011). The geometric mean MICs for ESBL-producing isolates were 0.07?μg/mL for meropenem, 9.51?μg/mL for tazobactam/piperacillin, 0.15?μg/mL for flomoxef, and 1.56?μg/mL for gentamycin. There was a significant increase in the isolation rate of non-fragilis Bacteroides among Bacteroides fragilis group species between the two study periods (35.2% vs. 53.1%, p?=?0.007). More than 90% of isolates belonging to the B.?fragilis group remained susceptible to tazobactam/piperacillin, meropenem, and metronidazole. In contrast, lower levels of susceptibility were observed for cefmetazole (49.6%), moxifloxacin (61.9%), and clindamycin (46.9%). Non-fragilis Bacteroides isolates had lower rates of antibiotic susceptibility compared with B.?fragilis.

We used the World Health Organization database to calculate NPC mortality trends from 1970 to 2014 in several countries worldwide. For the European Union (EU), the United States (US) and Japan, we also predicted trends to 2020. In 2012, the highest age-standardized (world standard) rates were in Hong Kong (4.51/100,000 men and 1.15/100,000 women), followed by selected Eastern European countries. The lowest rates were in Northern Europe and Latin America. EU rates were 0.27/100,000 men and 0.09/100,000 women, US rates were 0.20/100,000 men and 0.08/100,000 women and Japanese rates were 0.16/100,000 men and 0.04/100,000 women.

The decline was ?15% in men and ?5% in women between 2002 and 2012 in the EU, ?12% in men and ?9% in women in the US and about ?30% in both sexes in Hong Kong and Japan. The favourable patterns in Europe and the United States are predicted to continue. Changes in salted fish and preserved food consumption account for the fall in NKC. Smoking and alcohol prevalence disparities between sexes and geographic areas may explain the different rates and trends observed for KSCC and partially for NKC. Dietary patterns, as well as improvement in management of the disease, may partly account for the observed trends, too. ? 2017 UICC",alcohol; diet; Epstein Barr virus; mortality; nasopharyngeal cancer; tobacco,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cancer statistics; carcinoma; child; controlled study; data base; Eastern European; European Union; female; fish product; geographic distribution; Hong Kong; human; Japan; low risk population; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nasopharynx cancer; non-keratinizing carcinoma; Northern European; population research; prediction; preschool child; preserved food; prevalence; risk assessment; risk reduction; salt intake; school child; sex difference; smoking; South and Central America; standardization; trend study; United States; world health organization; young adult; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; cohort analysis; global health; infant; mortality; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; newborn; prognosis; risk factor; survival rate; time factor; trends; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Female; Global Health; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Survival Rate; Time Factors; World Health Organization; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85015234175

The aims of this study were to identify the factors associated with spiritual well-being and to compare the levels of spiritual well-being between subjects with advanced COPD and those with inoperable lung cancer. METHODS: A total of 96 subjects with COPD or lung cancer participated in this study, which was conducted between December 2014 and April 2016. Measures included the Japanese version of the 12-item Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-Sp-12) scale, the McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQOL), the modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea scale, and various other medico-social factors. RESULTS: No significant differences were found between subjects with COPD and those with lung cancer in median FACIT-Sp-12 scores (COPD, 27; lung cancer, 26; P =. 81). However, significant differences were found in the 2 MQOL domains, suggesting that subjects with COPD had a better psychological state (P =. 01) and that subjects with lung cancer had a better support state (P =. 002). Multiple regression analysis revealed that mMRC was significantly associated with FACIT-Sp-12 scores in subjects with COPD. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that subjects with advanced COPD experience spiritual well-being similar to that of subjects with inoperable lung cancer. ? 2017 Daedalus Enterprises.",COPD; Dyspnea; Lung cancer; Palliative care; Quality of life; Spiritual well-being,"adult; aged; Article; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical trial; constipation; coughing; diarrhea; dyspnea; fatigue; female; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Spiritual Well Being12 item score; human; loss of appetite; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; marriage; McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire; modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale; nausea; occupation; pain; quality of life assessment; respiratory tract disease assessment; scoring system; sleep; social psychology; spiritual care; weakness; wellbeing; chronic obstructive lung disease; comparative study; lung tumor; middle aged; nonparametric test; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; religion; severity of illness index; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive; Quality of Life; Severity of Illness Index; Spirituality; Statistics, Nonparametric; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85043357470

Mean amount of ascites collected was 3.7 L, and mean concentration ratio was 9.2. Mean amount of reinfused protein was 67.8 g (recovery rate, 72.0%). Performance status, dietary intake, urine volume, body weight and abdominal circumference were significantly improved after CART. Body temperature increased significantly, by 0.3°C on average. Concomitant steroids and/or NSAIDs use before reinfusion was significantly and negatively associated with increases in body temperature. Most adverse events were fever and chills. This study examined a large number of patients compared with previous studies, and showed that CART is an effective and relatively safe treatment for refractory ascites, such as malignant ascites. ? 2017 Hanafusa et al.

There are scant data regarding its performance in humans. Procedural outcomes comparing LithoVue with reusable ureteroscopes are presented in patients undergoing ureteroscopy for upper urinary tract pathology. Patients and Methods: Clinical outcomes between two groups of patients undergoing flexible ureteroscopy for upper urinary tract pathology were analyzed. The first group underwent surgery utilizing LithoVue, and the second group used reusable fiber-optic flexible ureteroscopes. Differences in procedural outcomes, operative times, and time spent in hospital were analyzed using two-tailed t-tests and chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests. Results: One hundred fifteen cases utilizing LithoVue and 65 cases utilizing reusable ureteroscopes were included in this study. Demographics, surgical indications, stone size, location, total stone burden, composition, procedural outcomes, and complications were comparable between groups. For all cases, LithoVue procedures lasted 54.1 ± 25.7 minutes compared with 64.5 ± 37.0 minutes for reusable scope procedures (p < 0.05) and for stone removal cases, 57.3 ± 25.1 vs 70.3 ± 36.9 minutes, respectively (p < 0.05). Scope failure occurred in 4.4% of LithoVue cases and 7.7% of reusable cases (p = 0.27). Conclusions: LithoVue represents a feasible alternative to reusable ureteroscopes with a low rate of scope failure comparable with reusable ureteroscopes. Its use shortens procedure duration, a finding that warrants further investigation. ? 2017 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",Equipment design; kidney calculi; ureteroscopes; urolithiasis,adult; age; Article; basket retrieval; case control study; clinical outcome; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; device failure; disease severity; electrode; feasibility study; female; flank pain; flexible disposable ureteroscope; flexible ureteroscope; hospitalization; human; kidney surgery; laser lithotripsy; major clinical study; male; middle aged; operation duration; peroperative complication; postoperative ileus; priority journal; prospective study; renal system parameters; reusable fiber optic ureteroscope; stone burden; stone removal; transitional cell carcinoma; upper urinary tract disease; ureteroscope; ureteroscopy; urinary tract disease; urinary tract infection; urolithiasis; aged; bladder tumor; comparative study; equipment design; fiber optics; nephrolithiasis; patient safety; procedures; treatment outcome; urothelium; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Equipment Design; Female; Fiber Optic Technology; Humans; Kidney Calculi; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Patient Safety; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Ureteroscopes; Ureteroscopy; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Urinary Calculi; Urothelium,2-s2.0-85019086371

Here, we show that the majority of OSCC tumors with lymph node metastasis, a major prognostic factor, exhibit high levels of phosphorylated AKT-S473 and PTENSTT and low levels of NDRG2expression. In Ndrg2-deficient mice, which develop a wide range of tumors, we developed a model of OSCC by treatment with the tobacco surrogate 4-nitroquinoline- 1-oxide (4-NQO). In this model, both the number and size of OSCC tumors were increased significantly by Ndrg2 deficiency, which also increased invasion of cervical lymph nodes. 4-NQO treatment of human OSCC cell lines exhibiting low NDRG2 expression induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition via activation of NF-κB signaling. Conversely, ectopic expression of NDRG2 reversed the EMT phenotype and inhibited NF-κB signaling via suppression of PTEN-STT and AKT-S473 phosphorylation.

However, there is little epidemiological evidence to support this. Objectives: In this large-scale community survey, we aimed to determine risks and cough-aggravating factors of prolonged cough while focusing on serum IgE levels. Methods: Prevalence of prolonged cough, defined as cough lasting 3 weeks or longer, was determined in 9,804 residents from a baseline measurement of the Nagahama Cohort Study, conducted from 2008 to 2010. Risk assessment of prolonged cough was confined to subjects without asthma (n = 9,402). A follow-up measurement of the Nagahama Study was successively conducted from 2013 to 2015, recruiting the same residents living in Nagahama City, Japan (n = 8,292). Validation analysis was performed in the follow-up measurement Results: In a baseline measurement, prolonged cough was reported by 9.5% of subjects without asthma and 32.3% of subjects with asthma. In subjects without asthma, various cough-aggravating factors were associated with prolonged cough. On the multivariate analysis, several cough-aggravating factors, including nighttime or early morning, weather, pollen season, and common cold, were associated with prolonged cough, independent of female sex, younger age, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, postnasal drip, daytime sputum, and lower serum total IgE. Serum-specific IgE levels against Japanese cedar pollen were significantly higher in subjects who responded ""yes"" to ""cough in the pollen season"" than in those who did not respond, whereas, among subjects who responded ""yes"" to ""cough in the pollen season,"" prolonged coughers showed lower serum IgE levels against Japanese cedar pollen than temporal coughers. Validation analysis in a follow-up measurement confirmed the associations between prolonged cough and cough-aggravating factors observed in the baseline measurement. Conclusions: The presence of several cough-aggravating factors in the absence of severe allergic conditions may support the presence of cough hypersensitivity.

Its activation can be a critical factor in drug-induced toxicity and the development of diseases, including diabetes and tumors. CAR inactivates its constitutive activity by phosphorylation at threonine 38. Utilizing receptor for protein kinase 1 (RACK1) as the regulatory subunit, protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) dephosphorylates threonine 38 to activate CAR. Here we demonstrate that CAR undergoes homodimer-monomer conversion to regulate this dephosphorylation. By coexpression of two differently tagged CAR proteins in Huh-7 cells, mouse primary hepatocytes, and mouse livers, coimmunoprecipitation and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis revealed that CAR can form a homodimer in a configuration in which the PP2A/RACK1 binding site is buried within its dimer interface. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) was found to stimulate CAR homodimerization, thus constraining CAR in its inactive form. The agonistic ligand CITCO binds directly to the CAR homodimer and dissociates phosphorylated CAR into its monomers, exposing the PP2A/RACK1 binding site for dephosphorylation. Phenobarbital, which is not a CAR ligand, binds the EGF receptor, reversing the EGF signal to monomerize CAR for its indirect activation. Thus, the homodimer-monomer conversion is the underlying molecular mechanism that regulates CAR activation, by placing phosphorylated threonine 38 as the common target for both direct and indirect activation of CAR. ? 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

Associations of serum periostin with systemic and airway eosinophilic inflammation and comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis in patients with asthma have been demonstrated. Although serum periostin is positioned as a marker of helper T cell 2 immune responses, its implication regarding the presence of comorbid upper airway diseases in patients with asthma remains unclear. Objectives: To investigate the utility of serum periostin as a diagnostic biomarker for upper airway disease in patients with asthma. Methods: We prospectively enrolled 65 patients with stable asthma, 20 without upper airway disease, 22 with rhinitis, and 23 with chronic rhinosinusitis (13 with nasal polyps, 10 without). Serum periostin, eotaxin, total IgE, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and blood and sputum eosinophil levels were measured and compared between upper airway disease subtypes. We evaluated the utility of each biomarker in detecting upper airway disease, associations among the biomarkers, and severity of upper airway disease as measured by the Lund-Mackay score for sinus computed tomography. Results: Serum periostin levels were higher in patients with asthma who had chronic rhinosinusitis (109.6 ± 47.4 ng/ml) than in those without upper airway disease (83.2 ± 22.9 ng/ml) (P = 0.04). Serum periostin levels in patients with asthma who had chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps were significantly higher (130.0 ± 46.6 ng/ml) than in those without nasal polyps (87.9 ± 37.7 ng/ml) (P = 0.001). Serum periostin levels were not associated with the presence or the severity of rhinitis. In contrast, receiver operating characteristic curve analyses showed moderate diagnostic accuracy for detecting chronic rhinosinusitis (area under the curve, 0.71;P = 0.01) and high accuracy for chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps (area under the curve, 0.86; P = 0.0002). When we compared patients with asthma who had comorbid chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps with patients with asthma without these comorbidities, we found serum periostin to be the sole biomarker among those tested for detecting the presence of nasal polyps. Serum periostin was also the sole biomarker that significantly correlated with Lund-Mackay score in patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (r = 0.44; P = 0.04). Conclusions: Serum periostin is useful for detecting chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps and predicting radiological chronic rhinosinusitis severity in patients with asthma.

We investigated genetic factors associated with the development of HCC in patients with a sustained virologic response (SVR) to treatment for chronic HCV infection. Methods We obtained genomic DNA from 457 patients in Japan with a SVR to interferon-based treatment for chronic HCV infection from 2007 through 2015. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS), followed by a replication analysis of 79 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in an independent set of 486 patients in Japan. The study end point was HCC diagnosis or confirmation of lack of HCC (at follow-up examinations until December 2014 in the GWAS cohort, and until January 2016 in the replication cohort). We collected clinical and laboratory data from all patients. We analyzed expression levels of candidate gene variants in human hepatic stellate cells, rats with steatohepatitis caused by a choline-deficient L-amino acid-defined diet, and a mouse model of liver injury caused by administration of carbon tetrachloride. We also analyzed expression levels in liver tissues of patients with chronic HCV infection with different stages of fibrosis or tumors vs patients without HCV infection (controls). Results We found a strong association between the SNP rs17047200, located within the intron of the tolloid like 1 gene (TLL1) on chromosome 4, and development of HCC; there was a genome-wide level of significance when the results of the GWAS and replication study were combined (odds ratio, 2.37; P?= 2.66?× 10?8). Multivariate analysis showed rs17047200 AT/TT to be an independent risk factor for HCC (hazard ratio, 1.78; P?=.008), along with male sex, older age, lower level of albumin, advanced stage of hepatic fibrosis, presence of diabetes, and higher post-treatment level of α-fetoprotein. Combining the rs17047200 genotype with other factors, we developed prediction models for HCC development in patients with mild or advanced hepatic fibrosis. Levels of TLL1 messenger RNA (mRNA) in human hepatic stellate cells increased with activation. Levels of Tll1 mRNA increased in liver tissues of rodents with hepatic fibrogenesis compared with controls. Levels of TLL1 mRNA increased in liver tissues of patients with progression of fibrosis. Gene expression levels of TLL1 short variants, including isoform 2, were higher in patients with rs17047200 AT/TT. Conclusions In a GWAS, we identified the association between the SNP rs17047200, within the intron of TLL1, and development of HCC in patients who achieved an SVR to treatment for chronic HCV infection. We found levels of Tll1/TLL1 mRNA to be increased in rodent models of liver injury and liver tissues of patients with fibrosis, compared with controls. We propose that this SNP might affect splicing of TLL1 mRNA, yielding short variants with high catalytic activity that accelerates hepatic fibrogenesis and carcinogenesis. Further studies are needed to determine how rs17047200 affects TLL1 mRNA levels, splicing, and translation, as well as the prevalence of this variant among other patients with HCC. Tests for the TLL1 SNP might be used to identify patients at risk for HCC after an SVR to treatment of HCV infection. ? 2017 AGA Institute",Genetics; Liver Cancer; Metalloprotease; Mutation,"albumin; alpha fetoprotein; carbon tetrachloride; choline; genomic DNA; messenger RNA; peginterferon; proteinase inhibitor; ribavirin; alpha fetoprotein; antivirus agent; choline; messenger RNA; serum albumin; TLL1 protein, human; tolloid metalloproteinase; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiviral therapy; Article; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; chromosome 4; chronic hepatitis C; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease course; experimental steatohepatitis; female; fibrogenesis; follow up; gene; gene expression; genetic association; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; genotype; hepatic stellate cell; human; human cell; human tissue; intron; Japan; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; liver injury; liver tissue; major clinical study; male; middle aged; monotherapy; mouse; nonhuman; pathogen clearance; priority journal; rat; replication study; single nucleotide polymorphism; sustained virologic response; tolloid like 1 gene; age; animal; case control study; complication; diabetic complication; fatty liver; genetics; Hepatitis C, Chronic; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver tumor; metabolism; risk factor; sex difference; virology; Age Factors; Aged; alpha-Fetoproteins; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Carbon Tetrachloride; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Case-Control Studies; Choline; Diabetes Complications; Fatty Liver; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hepatic Stellate Cells; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Introns; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Rats; Risk Factors; RNA, Messenger; Serum Albumin; Sex Factors; Sustained Virologic Response; Tolloid-Like Metalloproteinases",2-s2.0-85018814609

The aim of this phase III trial is to evaluate efficacy and safety of infliximab dose escalation in Japanese psoriasis patients with loss of efficacy to standard-dose therapy. Patients with plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, pustular psoriasis or psoriatic erythroderma who showed loss of efficacy to standard-dose therapy received infliximab dose escalation (10 mg/kg every 8 weeks) from weeks 0 to 32. Loss of efficacy was defined as not maintaining 50% reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50) after achieving PASI 75. Efficacy and safety were evaluated up to week 40. Fifty-one patients received dose escalation and 43 completed the study. PASI 75 and median improvement rate of PASI score at week 40 were 44% and 70.0%, respectively, showing efficacy in skin symptoms. Efficacies in quality of life, nail psoriasis and joint pain were also obtained. Median serum infliximab level increased from less than 0.1 to 1.1 μg/mL from weeks 0 to 40, showing positive correlation between efficacy and serum infliximab level at week 40. Favorable efficacy was observed in patients with detectable serum infliximab levels (?0.1 μg/mL) at baseline. Incidences of adverse events, serious adverse events, serious infections and serious infusion reactions were 92%, 10%, 4% and 0%, respectively. No marked difference was observed in both efficacy and safety among psoriasis types. No new safety concerns were observed. Infliximab dose escalation was effective and well-tolerated in psoriasis patients with loss of efficacy to standard-dose therapy, suggesting that dose escalation may be a useful therapeutic option for these patients. ? 2016 The Authors.

Patients commonly report a preference for non-pharmacological treatments such as psychotherapy over pharmacological treatments for depression. The objective of this review was to investigate the effectiveness of psychotherapy for the treatment of depression in people with advanced, incurable cancer via a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Methods We searched research databases and clinical trial registries for studies published prior to June 2015. No language restrictions were applied when selecting studies. Cochrane Collaboration meta-analysis review methodology was used. All relevant RCTs comparing psychotherapy with control conditions on depression outcomes for adults with advanced cancer were eligible for inclusion. We calculated pooled effect sizes using Hedges g and a standardized mean difference (SMD) of change between baseline and post-treatment scores. Quality of evidence was rated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Results Of 13 studies included in the review, 12 reported data suitable for meta-analysis. Psychotherapy was associated with moderate decrease in depression score (SMD ?0.67, 95% confidence interval ?1.06 to ?0.29, P?=?0.0005). Few studies focused on people with clinically diagnosed depression. Overall, quality of evidence across the included studies was rated as low, and heterogeneity was high. Conclusions Low quality evidence suggests that psychotherapy is moderately more effective for the amelioration of symptoms of depression among advanced, incurable cancer patients than the control conditions. There is insufficient high-quality evidence supporting the effectiveness of psychotherapy for patients with clinically diagnosed depression. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Anxiety; Depression; Neoplasms; Palliative care; Psycho-oncology; Psychotherapy,advanced cancer; anxiety; cancer patient; cognitive therapy; depression; distress syndrome; human; hypnosis; individual meaning centered psychotherapy; massage; meaning making intervention; meta analysis; psychoeducation; psychotherapy; quality of life; relaxation training; Review; systematic review; therapy effect; treatment outcome; depression; Depressive Disorder; Neoplasms; procedures; psychology; psychotherapy; randomized controlled trial (topic); Depression; Depressive Disorder; Humans; Neoplasms; Psychotherapy; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic,2-s2.0-85018651210

We conducted a multicenter, randomized, open-label phase II study to compare the efficacy and safety of weekly nab-paclitaxel and docetaxel in Japanese patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative MBC. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Patients were randomized to receive nab-paclitaxel (150?mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel once per week for 3 of 4?weeks; n?=?100) or docetaxel (75?mg/m2 docetaxel every 3?weeks; n?=?100). The median PFS by independent radiologist assessment was 9.8?months (90% confidence interval [CI]: 8.5–11.2) for nab-paclitaxel and 11.2?months (90% CI: 8.4–13.8) for docetaxel (hazard ratio: 1.25, P?=?0.363), and the median overall survival was 42.4?months and 34.0?months, respectively. The overall response rate was 56.1% for nab-paclitaxel and 52.5% for docetaxel. Adverse events in both treatment arms were similar to previous reports. Neutropenia was the most common adverse event in both arms, with 35.0% of patients in the nab-paclitaxel arm and 89.0% in the docetaxel arm experiencing grade 4 neutropenia.

In a previous study, we defined traction force and traction momentum and reported that these characteristics are important for optimal stent deployment. However, traction force and traction momentum were represented as relative values and were not evaluated in various conditions. The purpose of the present study was to measure traction force in various situations assumed during SEMS placement. Methods: Traction force and traction momentum were measured in non-stricture, stricture, and angled stricture models using in-house equipment. Results: Stricture and angled stricture models had significantly higher traction force and traction momentum than those of the non-stricture model (stricture vs non-stricture: traction force, 7.2?N vs 1.4?N, P?<?0.001; traction momentum, 237.8?Ns vs 62.3?Ns, P?=?0.001; angled stricture vs non-stricture: traction force, 7.4?N vs 1.4?N, P?<?0.001; traction momentum, 307.2?Ns vs 62.3?Ns, P?<?0.001). Traction force was variable during SEMS placement and was categorized into five different stages, which were similar in both the stricture and angled stricture models. Conclusions: We measured traction force and traction momentum under simulated clinical conditions and demonstrated that strictures and the angular positioning of the stent influenced the traction force. Clinicians should be aware of the transition of the traction force and should schedule X-ray imaging during SEMS placement. ? 2017 Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society",mechanical property; self-expandable metallic stent; traction force; traction force transition; traction momentum,"Article; bile duct cancer; biomechanics; biophysics; catheterization; cholestasis; controlled study; experimental model; force; mathematical computing; measurement; self expandable metallic stent; biliary tract disease; human; mechanics; prosthesis design; self expandable metallic stent; standards; theoretical model; Biliary Tract Diseases; Humans; Mechanical Phenomena; Models, Theoretical; Prosthesis Design; Self Expandable Metallic Stents",2-s2.0-85017422643

Methods Putative causal association signals from a GWAS of 945 clinically defined gout cases and 1213 controls from Japanese males were replicated with 1396 cases and 1268 controls using a custom chip of 1961 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We also first conducted GWASs of gout subtypes. Replication with Caucasian and New Zealand Polynesian samples was done to further validate the loci identified in this study. Results In addition to the five loci we reported previously, further susceptibility loci were identified at a genome-wide significance level (p&lt;5.0×10-8): Urate transporter genes (SLC22A12 and SLC17A1) and HIST1H2BF-HIST1H4E for all gout cases, and NIPAL1 and FAM35A for the renal underexcretion gout subtype. While NIPAL1 encodes a magnesium transporter, functional analysis did not detect urate transport via NIPAL1, suggesting an indirect association with urate handling. Localisation analysis in the human kidney revealed expression of NIPAL1 and FAM35A mainly in the distal tubules, which suggests the involvement of the distal nephron in urate handling in humans. Clinically ascertained male patients with gout and controls of Caucasian and Polynesian ancestries were also genotyped, and FAM35A was associated with gout in all cases. A meta-analysis of the three populations revealed FAM35A to be associated with gout at a genome-wide level of significance (p meta =3.58×10-8). Conclusions Our findings including novel gout risk loci provide further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of gout and lead to a novel concept for the therapeutic target of gout/hyperuricaemia. ? 2017 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.",Arthritis; Gene Polymorphism; Gout,"sodium phosphate cotransporter 1; urate; urate transporter; cation transport protein; FAM35A protein, human; histone; NIPAL1 protein, human; organic anion transporter; organic cation transporter; protein; SLC17A1 protein, human; SLC22A12 protein, human; sodium phosphate cotransporter 1; animal cell; Article; Caucasian; causality; controlled study; disease association; disease classification; FAM35A gene; female; gene; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; gene location; gene locus; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genome-wide association study; genotype; gout; HIST1H2BF HIST1H4E gene; human; human tissue; Japanese (citizen); kidney distal tubule; major clinical study; male; molecular pathology; nephron; New Zealand; NIPAL1 gene; nonhuman; Polynesian; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLC17A1 gene; SLC22A12 gene; urate transporter gene; validation study; adult; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; case control study; classification; gene locus; genetic predisposition; genetics; gout; Japan; meta analysis; middle aged; Oceanic ancestry group; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Case-Control Studies; Cation Transport Proteins; European Continental Ancestry Group; Genetic Loci; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Gout; Histones; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Organic Anion Transporters; Organic Cation Transport Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Proteins; Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type I",2-s2.0-85006010711

Methods: A total of 205 patients with the early distant recurrence and 134 patients with the late distant recurrence of ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who had undergone breast surgery or neoadjuvant chemotherapy between January 2000 and December 2004 were registered from nine institutions. Prognostic factors for post-relapse survival in patients with the early and late recurrence were analyzed. Results: Post-relapse survival was significantly longer in patients with the late recurrence than in patients with the early recurrence. Predictive factors for post-relapse survival in patients with the early recurrence were lack of adjuvant chemotherapy, a long disease-free interval, and long durations of endocrine therapies and chemotherapies after relapse. In patients with the late recurrence, post-relapse survival was significantly improved for those individuals with one metastatic organ at relapse and individuals who were treated with the first-line and subsequent endocrine therapies for prolonged periods. Moreover, ER expression in primary breast tumors of late recurrence patients was significantly higher with a duration of the first-line endocrine therapy >6?months than in those with a duration ?6?months. Conclusion: Predictors for prognosis after relapse differed between patients with the early and late distant recurrence. Endocrine responsiveness after relapse is a key factor for improved post-relapse survival, and it is thus important to establish whether metastatic tumors are endocrine-resistant in ER-positive, HER2-negative recurrent breast cancer. ? 2016, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.",Breast cancer; Endocrine therapy; Estrogen receptor-positive; Post-relapse survival; Prognosis,"antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; hormone; Ki 67 antigen; progesterone receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; estrogen receptor; Article; bone metastasis; brain metastasis; breast cancer; breast surgery; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer hormone therapy; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer resistance; clinical feature; controlled study; disease free interval; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; female; follow up; histopathology; human; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative breast cancer; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; liver metastasis; lung metastasis; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; post relapse survival; protein expression; retrospective study; survival; treatment duration; Breast Neoplasms; clinical trial; cohort analysis; disease free survival; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; pathology; prognosis; tumor recurrence; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prognosis; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen",2-s2.0-84988443341

Current approaches to identifying miRNA targets are insufficient for elucidation of a miRNA regulatory network. Here, we created a cell-based screening system using a luciferase reporter library composed of 4,891 full-length cDNAs, each of which was integrated into the 3′ UTR of a luciferase gene. Using this reporter library system, we conducted a screening for targets of miR-34a, a tumor-suppressor miRNA. We identified both previously characterized and previously uncharacterized targets. miR-34a overexpression in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells repressed the expression of these previously unrecognized targets. Among these targets, GFRA3 is crucial for MDA-MB-231 cell growth, and its expression correlated with the overall survival of patients with breast cancer. Furthermore, GFRA3 was found to be directly regulated by miR-34a via its coding region. These data show that this system is useful for elucidating miRNA functions and networks. ? 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Here, we examined the potential of human induced-pluripotent stem (iPS) cell-derived hepatocyte-like cells (iPS-HLCs) as an in vitro HBV infection model. Expression levels of several genes involved in HBV infection, including the sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) gene, were gradually elevated as the differentiation status of human iPS cells proceeded to iPS-HLCs. The mRNA levels of these genes were comparable between primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and iPS-HLCs. Following inoculation with HBV, we found significant production of HBV proteins and viral RNAs in iPS-HLCs. The three major forms of the HBV genome were detected in iPS-HLCs by Southern blotting analysis. Anti-HBV agents entecavir and Myrcludex-B, which are a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor and a synthetic pre-S1 peptide, respectively, significantly inhibited HBV infection in iPS-HLCs. These data demonstrate that iPS-HLCs can be used as a promising in vitro HBV infection model. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"cotransporter; organic anion transporter; sodium-bile acid cotransporter; viral protein; virus RNA; cell differentiation; cell line; cytology; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; host pathogen interaction; human; induced pluripotent stem cell; liver cell; metabolism; pathology; physiology; virology; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatocytes; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Dependent; RNA, Viral; Symporters; Viral Proteins",2-s2.0-85016986788

Patients and methods: Thirty eight HLA-A*24:02-positive patients with progressive UC were enrolled in this study. In the phase I part of the study, three patients each were treated with S-288310 at 1mg or 2 mg/peptide subcutaneously once a week to evaluate safety and tolerability. In the phase II, 32 patients were randomized to receive either 1mg or 2mg to evaluate the difference in cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) induction and safety. Results: S-288310 was safe and well tolerated in the phase I. Of 27 patients evaluable for immune responses in the phase II, there was no difference in CTL induction rate between the 1mg (100%) and 2mg (80.0%) groups. Of 32 patients receiving S-288310 in the phase II, the most frequent drug-related AE was the injection site reaction that was observed in 29 patients (90.6%), but none of the patients discontinued administration due to these reactions and no dose relationship in the frequency and severity was observed. The objective response rate of the 32 patients was 6.3% and the disease control rate was 56.3%. The median overall survival (OS) rates for patients vaccinated with S-288310 after one regimen of chemotherapy, 2 regimens, or 3 or more were 14.4, 9.1 and 3.7 months, respectively, and 32.2% of patients post first-line treatment were alive at 2 years. OS of patients who showed CTL induction to both peptides was longer than that of those with CTL induction to no or one peptide. Conclusion: S-288310 was well-tolerated and effectively induced peptide-specific CTLs, which were correlated with longer survival for patients with UC of the bladder.

Currently, first-generation PDT using porfimer sodium with an excimer dye laser, and second-generation PDT using talaporfin sodium PDT with a semiconductor laser are approved by health insurance for use in Japan. However, the cancer cell specificity and selectivity of these treatments are inadequate. Cancer cells consume higher levels of glucose than normal cells and this phenomenon is known as the Warburg effect. Thus, we developed a third-generation PDT, based on the Warburg effect, by synthesizing a novel photosensitizer, sugar-conjugated chlorin, with increased cancer cell-selective accumulation. Glucose-conjugated chlorin (G-chlorin) PDT showed significantly stronger antitumor effects than second-generation talaporfin PDT. We also found that PDT with G-chlorin induced immunogenic cell death which is characterized by the secretion, release, or surface exposure of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including calreticulin (CRT) and the high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein. Mannose-conjugated chlorin (M-chlorin) PDT which targets the mannose receptors on the surface of cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in cancer tissue stroma also showed very strong antitumor effects. These novel PDTs using glucose or M-chlorins stand as new candidates for very effective, next-generation PDTs. ? Annals of Translational Medicine.

From starting as a rudimentary form of imaging, it has come to play a more prominent role over time, paralleling evolution in ultrasound technology. Throughout the medical community there is a growing emphasis on reducing the amount of ionizing radiation delivered to patients during routine imaging. As such there has been a resurgence of interest in ultrasound given its lack of associated radiation exposure and proven effectiveness as a diagnostic and therapeutic imaging modality. Herein, we provide a review of the history of ultrasound, how the use of ultrasound is expanding in both diagnosis and treatment of urinary stone disease, and finally how promising applications of ultrasound are shaping the future of kidney stone management. ?

The energy metabolic pathway is a potential target of cancer therapy because it is often different between cancer cells and normal cells. However, the metabolic properties of medulloblastoma stem cells, and whether specific metabolic pathways are essential for sustaining their stem cell-like phenotype and radioresistance, remain unclear. We have established radioresistant medulloblastoma stem-like clones (rMSLCs) by irradiation of the human medulloblastoma cell line ONS-76. Here, we assessed reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, mitochondria function, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), energy state, and metabolites of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid cycle in rMSLCs and parental cells. rMSLCs showed higher lactate production and lower oxygen consumption rate than parental cells. Additionally, rMSLCs had low mitochondria mass, low endogenous ROS production, and existed in a low-energy state. Treatment with the metabolic modifier dichloroacetate (DCA) resulted in mitochondria dysfunction, glycolysis inhibition, elongated mitochondria morphology, and increased ROS production. DCA also increased radiosensitivity by suppression of the DNA repair capacity through nuclear oxidization and accelerated the generation of acetyl CoA to compensate for the lack of ATP. Moreover, treatment with DCA decreased cancer stem cell-like characters (e.g., CD133 positivity and sphere-forming ability) in rMSLCs. Together, our findings provide insights into the specific metabolism of rMSLCs and illuminate potential metabolic targets that might be exploited for therapeutic benefit in medulloblastoma. ? 2017 Sun et al.

Methods: We analyzed 7600 pregnant females from June to December 2011. The incidence of physical and mental DV and the proportions in the inland, north coastal, and south coastal areas of Miyagi Prefecture and nationwide were calculated, and a chi-square test was conducted for comparison. The risk factors for DV were estimated with multivariate logistic regression analyses on a prefecture-wide basis. Results: The incidence levels for physical DV were found to be 5.9% in the north coastal area, which was significantly higher than in the inland area (1.3%, P=0.0007) and nationwide (1.5%, P<0.0001). There were no significant differences in the incidence of mental DV between the 3 areas in Miyagi Prefecture (inland 15.2%, north coast 15.7%, and south coast 18.8%) or nationwide (13.8%). Experiencing disease or injury in someone close and changes in the family structure were significantly associated with mental DV in Miyagi Prefecture.

Pimaric acid (PiMA) is a unique opener of large conductance Ca2+-activated K+ channel. Here, we report that PiMA modulates recombinant rodent KV channel activity. The enhancement was significant at low potentials (&lt;0?mV) but not at more positive potentials. Application of PiMA significantly shifted the voltage-activation relationships (V1/2) of rodent KV1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.6 and 2.1 channels (KV1.1–KV2.1) but KV4.3 to lower potentials and prolonged their half-decay times of the deactivation (T1/2D). The amino acid sequence which is responsible for the difference in response to PiMA was examined between KV1.1–KV2.1 and KV4.3 by site-directed mutagenesis of residues in S5 and S6 segments of Kv1.1. The point mutation of Phe332 into Tyr mimics the effects of PiMA on V1/2 and T1/2D and also abolished the further change by addition of PiMA. The results indicate that PiMA enhances voltage sensitivity of KV1.1–KV2.1 channels and suggest that the lipophilic residues including Phe332 in S5 of KV1.1–KV2.1 channels may be critical for the effects of PiMA, providing beneficial information for drug development of KV channel openers. ? 2017 The Authors",Ca2+-activated K+ channel; Channel gating; K+ channel opener; Rosin acid; Voltage-gated K+ channel,"pimaric acid; potassium channel Kv1.1; potassium channel Kv1.2; potassium channel Kv1.3; potassium channel Kv1.4; potassium channel Kv1.6; potassium channel Kv2.1; potassium channel Kv4.3; potassium channel stimulating agent; unclassified drug; voltage gated potassium channel; calcium; diterpene; pimaric acid; voltage gated potassium channel; amino acid sequence; Article; channel gating; controlled study; drug activity; embryo; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; modulation; molecular mechanics; mouse; nonhuman; potassium current; protein expression; rat; site directed mutagenesis; transport kinetics; action potential; chemistry; drug development; drug effects; genetics; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; physiology; point mutation; Action Potentials; Amino Acid Sequence; Calcium; Diterpenes; Drug Discovery; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Point Mutation; Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated",2-s2.0-85017130047

Materials and Methods: Clinical data of 3,214 patients who underwent RARP for the treatment of clinically localized prostate cancer between April 2012 and March 2013 in Japan were evaluated. Surgical outcomes and all intra-A nd perioperative complications were collected. Results: The intraoperative complication rate was 0.56%. In a total number of 241 patients, 261 perioperative complications were observed. The following percentages of patients presented the Clavien-graded complications: 7.2%, grades 1-2; 0.84%, grade 3; and 0.093%, grade 4a.

Aberrant O-mannosylation of α-DG leads to severe congenital muscular dystrophies due to detachment of ECM proteins from the basal membrane. Phosphorylation at C6-position of O-mannose catalyzed by protein O-mannosyl kinase (POMK) is a crucial step in the biosynthetic pathway of O-mannose glycan. Several mis-sense mutations of the POMK catalytic domain are known to cause a severe congenital muscular dystrophy, Walker–Warburg syndrome. Due to the low sequence similarity with other typical kinases, structure–activity relationships of this enzyme remain unclear. Here, we report the crystal structures of the POMK catalytic domain in the absence and presence of an ATP analogue and O-mannosylated glycopeptide. The POMK catalytic domain shows a typical protein kinase fold consisting of N- and C-lobes. Mannose residue binds to POMK mainly via the hydroxyl group at C2-position, differentiating from other monosaccharide residues. Intriguingly, the two amino acid residues K92 and D228, interacting with the triphosphate group of ATP, are donated from atypical positions in the primary structure.

The mechanisms underlying the disease process have not been precisely identified, but recent evidence has suggested that the activation of myocardial inflammation is involved in the deterioration associated with the condition. Methods and results: Biopsy samples from 182 consecutive DCM patients were immunohistochemically stained with antibodies specific to CD3 (T lymphocytes), CD68 (whole macrophages), and CD163 (M2 macrophages), and each type of infiltrating cell was counted. Masson's trichrome staining was used to determine the collagen area fraction (CAF) in each sample. Patients were followed up for 6.9 ± 2.4 years, and their clinical data were obtained for analysis. Median (interquartile range) numbers of myocardial CD3, CD68, and CD163-cell infiltrates were 8.1 (4.0–14.2)/mm2, 22.3 (12.1–36.0)/mm2, and 6.5 (2.0–14.0)/mm2, respectively. Patients with higher counts of infiltrating CD3-, CD68-, and CD163-positive cells had significantly poorer outcomes (P = 0.007, P = 0.011, and P = 0.022, respectively). A high CD163-positive infiltrate count was independently associated with worse outcome in multivariate Cox regression analysis (hazard ratio 1.77, P = 0.004), and multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that the CD163 cell count was an independent determinant of CAF (P &lt; 0.001). Conclusions: It was found that DCM with increased myocardial immune activation was associated with poor long-term outcome. The association between M2 macrophages and collagen formation suggests the phenotypic polarization of macrophages toward M2 may be associated with ventricular remodelling in DCM. ? 2017 The Authors.

Psoriasis might be due to an unbalanced ratio of Th17 cells and regulatory T cells (Treg). The Treg functional ratio is significantly lower in patients with psoriasis compared with controls and is inversely correlated with the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score. We previously reported that bath-PUVA therapy significantly increases the number of Treg and restores Treg function to almost normal in most patients with psoriasis. Objectives We examined the effects of bath-PUVA therapy on three distinct Foxp3+ subsets: activated Treg (aTreg), resting Treg (rTreg), and cytokine-secreting non-suppressive T cells. Methods We enrolled 15 patients with psoriasis and 11 healthy controls. We examined aTreg, rTreg, and cytokine-secreting non-suppressive T cells in peripheral blood obtained from the psoriasis patients before and after every fifth bath-PUVA therapy session. Results Levels of aTreg, which are considered to have the strongest suppressive activity in patients with psoriasis, were significantly increased in the early bath-PUVA therapy sessions, and then diminished. Levels of rTreg were lower in psoriasis patients than in healthy controls, and increased during bath-PUVA therapy. Conclusions Bath-PUVA therapy induced aTreg and rTreg concomitantly with an improvement in the psoriatic lesions, suggesting a mechanism for the effectiveness of bath-PUVA therapy for psoriasis patients. ? 2017 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology",Bath-PUVA therapy; Cytokines; Psoriasis; Regulatory; T-Lymphocytes; Ultraviolet therapy,"transcription factor FOXP3; forkhead transcription factor; FOXP3 protein, human; methoxsalen; photosensitizing agent; activated regulatory T cell; adult; Article; CD4+ CD25+ T lymphocyte; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; cytokine secreting non suppressive T cell; female; human; lymphocyte count; male; outcome assessment; prediction; psoriasis; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; PUVA; radiation exposure; regulatory T lymphocyte; resting regulatory T cell; T lymphocyte subpopulation; therapy effect; upregulation; aged; bath; blood; drug effects; metabolism; middle aged; procedures; psoriasis; PUVA; regulatory T lymphocyte; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Baths; Female; Forkhead Transcription Factors; Humans; Male; Methoxsalen; Middle Aged; Photosensitizing Agents; Psoriasis; PUVA Therapy; Severity of Illness Index; T-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85011004602

For further improvement of ranibizumab-based treatment, we developed ranibizumab biosimilar (Mab)/polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-conjugated small gold nanoparticles (core size: approximately 5?nm) as a novel platform of ranibizumab biosimilar (Mab) delivery. Mab/PEG-conjugated gold nanoparticles were successfully prepared, and the particles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering method. The mean diameters of Mab/PEG-conjugated gold nanoparticles and PEG-conjugated gold nanoparticles were varied using different lengths of PEG chain (5?kDa and 10?kDa). The Mab conjugation efficiency was optimized by changing the amount of PEG in preparation, which showed a high conjugation efficiency (>70%). We found that Mab/PEG-conjugated gold nanoparticles effectively inhibited the tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells based on Matrigel in?vitro. PEG-conjugated gold nanoparticles without Mab inhibited the tube formation unexpectedly. The Mab/PEG-conjugated gold nanoparticles did not affect cell proliferation in human endothelial cells. These results suggest that Mab/PEG-conjugated gold nanoparticles can be used as a good and novel colloidal formulation against angiogenesis-related diseases in local sites such as age-related macular degeneration. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Age-related macular degeneration; Biosimilar; Gold nanoparticles; PEGylation; Ranibizumab,biosimilar agent; gold nanoparticle; macrogol; matrigel; nanocarrier; ranibizumab; vasculotropin A; age related macular degeneration; antiangiogenic activity; Article; cell proliferation; concentration response; controlled study; dispersity; drug adsorption; drug conjugation; drug delivery system; drug elimination; drug formulation; human; human cell; molecular weight; particle size; photon correlation spectroscopy; surface area; transmission electron microscopy; umbilical vein endothelial cell,2-s2.0-85010904507

In contrast to HCV, however, the strategy for developing new antiviral agents against hepatitis B virus (HBV), especially viral-targeting compounds, is limited because HBV requires only four viral genes for its efficient replication/infection. Here, we identify an oligomeric flavonoid, proanthocyanidin (PAC) and its analogs, which inhibit HBV entry into host cells by targeting the HBV large surface protein (LHBs). Through cell-based chemical screening, PAC was identified to inhibit HBV infection with little cytotoxic effect. PAC prevented the attachment of the preS1 region in the LHBs to its cellular receptor, sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). PAC was shown to target HBV particles and impair their infectivity, whereas it did not affect the NTCP-mediated bile acid transport activity. Chemical biological techniques demonstrated that PAC directly interacted with the region essential for receptor binding in the preS1 region in the LHBs protein. Importantly, PAC had a pan-genotypic anti-HBV activity and was also effective against a clinically relevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV isolate. We further showed that PAC augmented the ability of a nucleoside analog, tenofovir, to interrupt HBV spread over time in primary human hepatocytes by cotreatment. Moreover, derivative analysis could identify small molecules that demonstrated more-potent anti-HBV activity over PAC. Conclusion: PAC and its analogs represent a new class of anti-HBV agents that directly target the preS1 region of the HBV large surface protein. These agents could contribute to the development of a potent, well-tolerated, and broadly active inhibitor of HBV infection.

Unfortunately, these agents also block NTCP transport of bile acids into hepatocytes, and thus have the potential to cause adverse effects. We aimed to identify small molecules that inhibit HBV entry while maintaining NTCP transporter function. Methods We characterized a series of cyclosporine (CsA) derivatives for their anti-HBV activity and NTCP binding specificity using HepG2 cells overexpressing NTCP and primary human hepatocytes. The four most potent derivatives were tested for their capacity to prevent HBV entry, but maintain NTCP transporter function. Their antiviral activity against different HBV genotypes was analysed. Results We identified several CsA derivatives that inhibited HBV infection with a sub-micromolar IC50. Among them, SCY446 and SCY450 showed low activity against calcineurin (CN) and cyclophilins (CyPs), two major CsA cellular targets. This suggested that instead, these compounds interacted directly with NTCP to inhibit viral attachment to host cells, and have no immunosuppressive function. Importantly, we found that SCY450 and SCY995 did not impair the NTCP-dependent uptake of bile acids, and inhibited multiple HBV genotypes including a clinically relevant nucleoside analog-resistant HBV isolate. Conclusions This is the first example of small molecule selective inhibition of HBV entry with no decrease in NTCP transporter activity. It suggests that the anti-HBV activity can be functionally separated from bile acid transport. These broadly active anti-HBV molecules are potential candidates for developing new drugs with fewer adverse effects. Lay summary In this study, we identified new compounds that selectively inhibited hepatitis B virus (HBV) entry, and did not impair bile acid uptake. Our evidence offers a new strategy for developing anti-HBV drugs with fewer side effects. ? 2016 European Association for the Study of the Liver",Antiviral; Bile acids and salts; Cyclophilins; Cyclosporine; HBV; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis D virus; Infection; Membrane transport proteins; NTCP; PreS1; Replication,"antivirus agent; bile acid; calcineurin; cyclophilin; cyclosporin derivative; hepatitis B antigen; sodium bile acid cotransporter; antivirus agent; bile acid; cotransporter; cyclosporin derivative; organic anion transporter; sodium-bile acid cotransporter; antiviral activity; Article; binding affinity; controlled study; Hep-G2 cell line; Hepatitis B virus; host cell; human; IC50; immunosuppressive treatment; in vitro study; nonhuman; priority journal; virus attachment; cell culture; drug effects; genetics; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis delta virus; liver cell; metabolism; physiology; virology; virus entry; Antiviral Agents; Bile Acids and Salts; Cells, Cultured; Cyclosporins; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis Delta Virus; Hepatocytes; Humans; Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Dependent; Symporters; Virus Internalization",2-s2.0-85009179101

The utility of fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) measurement in the differential diagnosis of persistent cough has been reported, but the influence of atopic status, which is associated with higher FeNO levels, on the diagnostic utility of FeNO has been unknown. Methods We retrospectively analyzed 105 non-smoking patients with prolonged and chronic cough that were not treated with corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes. Results CPA was diagnosed in 37 patients, CVA in 40, and non-asthmatic cough (NAC) in 28. FeNO levels were significantly higher in the CPA [35.8 (7.0–317.9)?ppb] and CVA [24.9 (3.1–156.0)?ppb] groups than in the NAC group [18.2 (6.9–49.0)?ppb] (p?<?0.01 by Kruskal–Wallis test).

We previously reported that recombinant fusion protein of murine IL-35 and human IgG1 Fc fragment (rIL-35) reduced Th2 cytokines (IL-4 and IL-5) in?vitro. However, it is unclear whether IL-35 can attenuate nasal allergic responses and symptoms of allergic rhinitis in?vivo. Methods To investigate the in?vivo effect of IL-35 on allergic rhinitis in mice, mice were sensitized with ovalbumin (OVA). Intranasal administration of rIL-35 and intranasal challenge of OVA were then performed. Nasal symptoms were estimated after the last nasal challenge. Nasal tissue and cervical lymph nodes (CLN) were collected. OVA-specific IgE in sera, OVA-specific T cell response, and the production of cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10) stimulated by the OVA antigen were measured. The transcription level of Foxp3 and the frequency of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells were also measured. Results rIL-35 significantly inhibited the number of sneezes and nasal rubbing movements. It also reduced the number of eosinophils in the nasal mucosa and significantly decreased the level of OVA-specific IgE, the OVA-specific T cell proliferation, and the production of IL-4 and IL-5. Furthermore, rIL-35 significantly increased the production of IL-10, the transcription level of Foxp3, and the frequency of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells. Conclusions This study showed for the first time that rIL-35 inhibits nasal allergic responses and symptoms in mice, and that rIL-35 increases IL-10, Foxp3, and CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells in CLN.

Methods: In this retrospective study, the pretreatment serum IL-6 and plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels were measured in 113 patients with metastatic CRC. The cut-off values for these measurements, as determined by a receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, were 4.3 and 66?pg/mL, respectively. The median follow-up period was 19?months (range 1–40?months). Sixty-three patients had primary cancer, and 38 had a metachronous recurrence. Thirty patients underwent curative resection, and 71 underwent chemotherapy, 53 of whom received bevacizumab-containing chemotherapy. Overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were estimated using Kaplan–Meier and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Results: The plasma VEGF levels and positive KRAS mutation status were not associated with the outcomes. However, high serum IL-6 levels were significantly associated with poorer OS and PFS in comparison to low serum IL-6 levels. A Cox proportional hazards regression analysis showed that high serum IL-6 levels were an independent risk factor for a poor outcome.

The purpose of the present study was to identify altered molecular networks in the prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients by comparing protein expression levels in autopsied brains of patients and controls, using a combination of targeted and focused quantitative proteomics. We selected 125 molecules possibly related to schizophrenia for quantification by knowledge-based targeted proteomics. Among the quantified molecules, GRIK4 and MAO-B were significantly decreased in plasma membrane and cytosolic fractions, respectively, of prefrontal cortex. Focused quantitative proteomics identified 15 increased and 39 decreased proteins. Network analysis identified “GNA13-ERK1-eIF4G2 signaling” as a downregulated network, and proteins involved in this network were significantly decreased. Furthermore, searching downstream of eIF4G2 revealed that eIF4A1/2 and CYFIP1 were decreased, suggesting that downregulation of the network suppresses expression of CYFIP1, which regulates actin remodeling and is involved in axon outgrowth and spine formation. Downregulation of this signaling seems likely to impair axon formation and synapse plasticity of neuronal cells, and could be associated with development of cognitive impairment in the pathology of schizophrenia. Biological significance The present study compared the proteome of the prefrontal cortex between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls by means of targeted proteomics and global quantitative proteomics. Targeted proteomics revealed that GRIK4 and MAOB were significantly decreased among 125 putatively schizophrenia-related proteins in prefrontal cortex of schizophrenia patients. Global quantitative proteomics identified 54 differentially expressed proteins in schizophrenia brains. The protein profile indicates attenuation of “GNA13-ERK signaling” in schizophrenia brain. In particular, EIF4G2 and CYFIP1, which are located downstream of the GNA13-ERK network, were decreased, suggesting that the attenuation of this signal network may cause impairment of axon formation and synapse plasticity in the brain of schizophrenia patients.

It has been suggested that reduced Reelin activity contributes to the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease; however, noninvasive methods that can upregulate Reelin activity in vivo have yet to be developed. We previously found that the proteolytic cleavage of Reelin within Reelin repeat 3 (N-t site) abolishes Reelin activity in vitro, but it remains controversial as to whether this effect occurs in vivo. Here we partially purified the enzyme that mediates the N-t cleavage of Reelin from the culture supernatant of cerebral cortical neurons. This enzyme was identified as a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs-3 (ADAMTS-3). Recombinant ADAMTS-3 cleaved Reelin at the N-t site. ADAMTS-3 was expressed in excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. N-t cleavage of Reelin was markedly decreased in the embryonic cerebral cortex of ADAMTS-3 knock-out (KO) mice. Importantly, the amount of Dab1 and the phosphorylation level of Tau, which inversely correlate with Reelin activity, were significantly decreased in the cerebral cortex of ADAMTS-3 KO mice. Conditional KO mice, in which ADAMTS-3 was deficient only in the excitatory neurons of the forebrain, showed increased dendritic branching and elongation in the postnatal cerebral cortex.

However, its neural mechanisms remain unclear. We herein examined population-level frequency tuning in the auditory cortex of unilateral tinnitus patients with similar hearing levels in both ears using magnetoencephalography. We compared auditory-evoked neural activities elicited by a stimulation to the tinnitus and nontinnitus ears. Objective magnetoencephalographic data suggested that population-level frequency tuning corresponding to the tinnitus ear was significantly broader than that corresponding to the nontinnitus ear in the human auditory cortex. The results obtained support the hypothesis that pathological alterations in inhibitory neural networks play an important role in the perception of subjective tinnitus. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Although subjective tinnitus is one of the most common public health concerns that impair the quality of life of many individuals, no standard treatment or objective diagnostic method currently exists.

The objectives were to evaluate the safety, tolerability, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of the regimen. Carfilzomib was administrated intravenously over 10?min on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of a 28-day cycle. In cycle 1, the dosage for days 1 and 2 was 20?mg/m2, followed by 27?mg/m2. Lenalidomide and dexamethasone were administered at 25?mg (days 1–21) and 40?mg (days 1, 8, 15 and 22), respectively. Twenty-six patients were enrolled. Patients had received a median of four prior regimens and 88.5% and 61.5% received previous bortezomib and lenalidomide, respectively. High-risk cytogenetics were seen in 53.8% of patients. The overall response rate was 88.5%. A higher rate of hyperglycemia was observed than in a previous carfilzomib monotherapy study, but this was attributed to dexamethasone.

We examined the relationship between SDB, sleep duration, obesity risk, and behavioral characteristics in Japanese elementary school students using a large-scale survey. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of children enrolled in all 46 public primary schools in Matsuyama city, Japan. The children's parents or guardians completed a questionnaire that covered sleep habits, presence of SDB risk, and behavioral characteristics. Results: In total, 24 296 responses were received (90% response rate). After excluding incomplete responses, we analyzed complete datasets for 17 769 children. Mean sleep duration decreased with age, as did the prevalence of pediatric SDB. We found an increased risk for the presence of SDB and short sleep among overweight/obese children. With SDB or short sleep, we observed significantly increased odds of restless behaviors, fidgety behaviors, and poor concentration in school. Conclusions: Shorter sleep duration was associated with increased risk of obesity, and in turn, obesity increased SDB risk. Both short sleep duration and SDB risk were significantly associated with behavioral problems in school. ? 2017, Associated Professional Sleep Societies,LLC.

They are also attracting attention in a variety of immunological issues, including autoimmunity and, in particular, their ability to regulate cytokine and chemokine activation. Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is considered a model autoimmune disease, which has a highly focused cytotoxic response against biliary epithelial cells. We have isolated exosomes from plasma from 29 patients with PBC and 30 healthy controls (HCs), and studied the effect of these exosomes on co-stimulatory molecule expression and cytokine production in mononuclear cell populations using an ex vivo system. We also identified the microRNA (miRNA) populations in PBC compared to HC exosomes. We report herein that although exosomes do not change cytokine production, they do significantly alter co-stimulatory molecule expression on antigen-presenting populations. Further, we demonstrated that CD86 up-regulated expression on CD14 + monocytes, whereas CD40 up-regulated on CD11c + dendritic cells by exosomes from patients with PBC. In addition, there were differences of miRNA expression of circulating exosomes in patients with PBC. These data have significant importance based on observations that co-stimulatory molecules play a differential role in the regulation of T-cell activation. Our observation indicated that aberrant exosomes from PBC selectively induce expression of co-stimulatory molecules in different subset of antigen-presenting cells. These alterations may involve in pathogenesis of autoimmune liver disease. ? 2017 CSI and USTC.

Capsaicin can activate transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) channels to increase cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]cyt). A rise in [Ca2+]cyt in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) is an important stimulus for pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. In this study, we observed that a capsaicin-induced increase in [Ca2+]cyt was significantly enhanced in PASMCs from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) compared with normal PASMCs from healthy donors. In addition, the protein expression level of TRPV1 in IPAH PASMCs was greater than in normal PASMCs. Increasing the temperature from 23 to 43°C, or decreasing the extracellular pH value from 7.4 to 5.9 enhanced capsaicin-induced increases in [Ca2+]cyt; the acidity (pH 5.9)-and heat (43°C)-mediated enhancement of capsaicin-induced [Ca2+]cyt increases were greater in IPAH PASMCs than in normal PASMCs. Decreasing the extracellular osmotic pressure from 310 to 200 mOsmol/l also increased [Ca2+]cyt, and the hypo-osmolarity-induced rise in [Ca2+]cyt was greater in IPAH PASMCs than in healthy PASMCs. Inhibition of TRPV1 (with 5′-IRTX or capsazepine) or knockdown of TRPV1 (with short hairpin RNA) attenuated capsaicin-, acidity-, and osmotic stretch-mediated [Ca2+]cyt increases in IPAH PASMCs. Capsaicin induced phosphorylation of CREB by raising [Ca2+]cyt, and capsaicin-induced CREB phosphorylation were significantly enhanced in IPAH PASMCs compared with normal PASMCs. Pharmacological inhibition and knockdown of TRPV1 attenuated IPAH PASMC proliferation. Taken together, the capsaicin-mediated [Ca2+]cyt increase due to upregulated TRPV1 may be a critical pathogenic mechanism that contributes to augmented Ca2+ influx and excessive PASMC proliferation in patients with IPAH. ? 2017 the American Physiological Society.",Capsaicin; Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension; Mechanosensitive cation channels; Osmotic pressure; TRPV1,"calcium ion; capsaicin; cation channel; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; short hairpin RNA; vanilloid receptor 1; capsaicin; capsazepine; chloride channel; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein; diterpene; iodoresiniferatoxin; potassium channel; TRPV1 protein, human; vanilloid receptor; 5' untranslated region; acidity; adult; Article; calcium transport; cell membrane potential; cell proliferation; clinical article; concentration response; controlled study; female; gene silencing; heat; human; human cell; human tissue; hypoosmolarity; long term potentiation; lung parenchyma; male; middle aged; normal human; osmotic pressure; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell; pulmonary hypertension; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; single channel patch clamp; temperature; upregulation; Western blotting; analogs and derivatives; calcium signaling; drug effects; electric conductivity; extracellular space; metabolism; osmosis; pathology; pH; phosphorylation; pulmonary artery; pulmonary hypertension; smooth muscle cell; upregulation; Adult; Calcium Signaling; Capsaicin; Cell Proliferation; Chloride Channels; Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein; Diterpenes; Electric Conductivity; Extracellular Space; Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension; Female; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Male; Middle Aged; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Osmosis; Phosphorylation; Potassium Channels; Pulmonary Artery; Temperature; TRPV Cation Channels; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85014698297

In this study, we evaluate this role at both cellular and individual levels. Isolated macrophages forcibly expressing Usp2a, a longer splicing variant of USP2, failed to modulate the insulin sensitivity of 3T3-L1 adipocytes. Similarly, macrophage-selective overexpression of Usp2a in mice (Usp2a transgenic mice) had a negligible effect on insulin sensitivity relative to wild type littermates following a three-month high-fat diet. However, Usp2a transgenic mice exhibited fewer M1 macrophages in their mesenteric adipose tissue. Following a six-month high-fat diet, Usp2a transgenic mice exhibited a retarded progression of insulin resistance in their skeletal muscle and liver, and an improvement in insulin sensitivity at an individual level. Although conditioned media from Usp2a-overexpressing macrophages did not directly affect the insulin sensitivity of C2C12 myotubes compared to media from control macrophages, they did increase the insulin sensitivity of C2C12 cells after subsequent conditioning with 3T3-L1 cells. These results indicate that macrophage USP2A hampers obesity-elicited insulin resistance via an adipocyte-dependent mechanism. ? 2017 The Authors",Diabetes; Insulin; Macrophage; Obesity; USP,deubiquitinase; ubiquitin specific protease 2; unclassified drug; adipocyte; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; enzyme activity; gene; gene overexpression; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lipid diet; macrophage; mesenteric fat; mouse; myotube; nonhuman; obesity; Usp2a gene,2-s2.0-85011976662

Genetic variations in genes of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) have been related to the risk of GC, but their association with familial background is not clear. We investigated whether individuals with a multiple family history of GC have more risk genotypes of MMP/TIMP genes. Methods: We genotyped ten common functional polymorphisms of MMP/TIMP genes in 4427 individuals aged 35–69?years without a history of GC who were enrolled in the Japan Multi-institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Individuals who have two or more first-degree relatives (parents and siblings) with GC were categorized as having a multiple family history. Odds ratios (ORs) for multiple family history compared with no family history were calculated. Results: MMP9 279QQ (rs17576) was more frequently observed in individuals whose both parents had a history of GC (n?=?23) and in individuals for whom one parent and their sibling(s) had a history of GC (n?=?36) compared with those with no family history (n?=?3816) [30.4?% vs 11.6?%, OR 4.34, 95?% confidence interval (CI) 1.45–13.03 and 16.7?% vs 11.6?%, OR 2.26, 95?% CI 0.81–6.27 after adjustment for age, sex, and current smoking]. The population attributable fraction was 38.1?%. The haplotype MMP9-1562C/279Q/668Q was more frequently observed in individuals whose both parents had a history of GC and in individuals for whom one parent and their sibling(s) had a history of GC compared with those with no family history (OR 3.35, 95?% CI 0.75–14.96 and OR 3.51, 95?% CI 1.35–9.15 respectively). Conclusions: MMP9 polymorphisms were associated with a multiple family history of GC.

To manage and control this worldwide infectious disease better, the ""best"" multidrug treatment is demanded based on scientific evidence. However, there is no method available that systematically quantifies and compares the antiviral efficacy and drug-resistance profiles of drug combinations. Based on experimental anti-HCV profiles in a cell culture system, we quantified the instantaneous inhibitory potential (IIP), which is the logarithm of the reduction in viral replication events, for both single drugs and multiple-drug combinations. From the calculated IIP of 15 anti-HCV drugs from different classes [telaprevir, danoprevir, asunaprevir, simeprevir, sofosbuvir (SOF), VX-222, dasabuvir, nesbuvir, tegobuvir, daclatasvir, ledipasvir, IFN-α, IFN-λ1, cyclosporin A, and SCY-635], we found that the nucleoside polymerase inhibitor SOF had one of the largest potentials to inhibit viral replication events. We also compared intrinsic antiviral activities of a panel of drug combinations. Our quantification analysis clearly indicated an advantage of triple-DAA treatments over double-DAA treatments, with triple-DAA treatments showing enhanced antiviral activity and a significantly lower probability for drug resistance to emerge at clinically relevant drug concentrations. Our framework provides quantitative information to consider in designing multidrug strategies before costly clinical trials. ? 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

Prevention is key to patient management, but risk stratification is challenging. In particular, genetic predisposition for urinary stones is not fully understood. Objective To review current evidence of potential causative genes for idiopathic urolithiasis and map their relationships to one another. This evidence is essential for future establishment of molecular targeted therapy. Evidence acquisition A systematic literature review from 2007 to 2017 was performed in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses guidelines. The search was restricted to human studies conducted as either case–control or genome-wide association studies, and published in English. We also performed a causal network analysis of candidate genes gained from the systematic review using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Evidence synthesis During the systematic screening of literature, 30 papers were selected for the review. A total of 20 genes with 42 polymorphisms/variants were found to be associated with urolithiasis risk. Their functional roles were mainly categorized as stone matrix, calcium and phosphate regulation, urinary concentration and constitution, and inflammation/oxidative stress. IPA network analysis revealed that these genes connected via signaling pathways and a proinflammatory/oxidative environment. Conclusions This systematic review provides an updated gene list and novel causal networks for idiopathic urolithiasis risk. Although some genes such as SPP1, CASR, VDR, CLDN14, and SLC34A1 were identified by several studies and recognized by prior reviews, further investigation elucidating their roles in stone formation will be essential for future studies. Patient summary In this review, we summarized recent literature regarding genes responsible for kidney stone risk. Based on a detailed review of 30 articles and computational network analysis, we concluded that disorder of mineral regulation with local inflammation in the kidney may cause kidney stone disease. ? 2017",Calcium; Genome-wide association study; Inflammation; Ingenuity Pathway Analysis; Nephrolithiasis; Phosphate; Randall's plaque; Single-nucleotide polymorphism; Urolithiasis,"alkaline phosphatase; aquaporin 1; Klotho protein; calcium; phosphate; CASR gene; CLDN14 gene; gene; gene mutation; genetic association; genetic predisposition; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; human; meta analysis; nephrolithiasis; NHERF1 gene; prevalence; protein expression; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLC34A1 gene; SLC9A3R1 gene; SPP1 gene; stone formation; systematic review; TRPV5 gene; urolithiasis; VDR gene; animal; chemistry; genetics; genome-wide association study; inflammation; metabolism; oxidative stress; risk factor; urolithiasis; Animals; Calcium; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Inflammation; Oxidative Stress; Phosphates; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Urinary Calculi; Urolithiasis",2-s2.0-85019953874

The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the NEDD8-Cullin E3 ligase, in maintaining barrier permeability. To this end, we investigated the effects of the inhibition of Cullin E3 ligases, by using inhibitors and knockdown techniques in HUVECs. Furthermore, we analyzed the mRNA and protein levels of the ligases by quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The results revealed that NEDD8-conjugated Cullin 3 is required for VE-cadherin-mediated endothelial barrier functions. Treatment of HUVECs with MLN4924, a chemical inhibitor of the NEDD8-activating enzyme, led to high vascular permeability due to impaired cell–cell contact. Similar results were obtained when HUVECs were treated with siRNA directed against Cullin 3, one of the target substrates of NEDD8. Immunocytochemical staining showed that both treatments equally depleted VE-cadherin protein localized at the cell–cell borders. However, quantitative RT-PCR showed that there was no significant difference in the VE-cadherin mRNA levels between the treatment and control groups. In addition, cycloheximide chase assay revealed that the half-life of VE-cadherin protein was dramatically reduced by Cullin 3 depletion. Together, these findings suggest that neddylated Cullin 3 plays a crucial role in endothelial cell barrier function by regulating VE-cadherin. ? 2016 The Authors.

However, there is currently no effective treatment to promote recovery from stroke-induced neurological symptoms. Recent studies suggest that after stroke, immature neurons, referred to as neuroblasts, generated in a neurogenic niche, the ventricular-subventricular zone, migrate toward the injured area, where they differentiate into mature neurons. Interventions that increase the number of neuroblasts distributed at and around the lesion facilitate neuronal repair in rodent models for ischemic stroke, suggesting that promoting neuroblast migration in the post-stroke brain could improve efficient neuronal regeneration. To move toward the lesion, neuroblasts form chain-like aggregates and migrate along blood vessels, which are thought to increase their migration efficiency. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating these migration processes are largely unknown. Here we studied the role of β1-class integrins, transmembrane receptors for extracellular matrix proteins, in these migrating neuroblasts. We found that the neuroblast chain formation and blood vessel-guided migration critically depend on β1 integrin signaling. β1 integrin facilitated the adhesion of neuroblasts to laminin and the efficient translocation of their soma during migration. Moreover, artificial laminin-containing scaffolds promoted neuroblast chain formation and migration toward the injured area. These data suggest that laminin signaling via β1 integrin supports vasculature-guided neuronal migration to efficiently supply neuroblasts to injured areas. This study also highlights the importance of vascular scaffolds for cell migration in development and regeneration. ? 2017 3-V Biosciences",Blood vessel; Chain migration; Laminin; Stroke; Vasculature-guided migration; β1 integrin,"beta integrin; biomaterial; broxuridine; laminin; tamoxifen; beta1 integrin; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; astrocyte culture; brain ischemia; cell contraction assay; cell migration; cell transplantation; coculture; controlled study; electron microscopy; immunohistochemistry; male; mouse; nerve regeneration; neuroblast; neuronal migration; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; time lapse imaging; tissue scaffold; animal; astrocyte; blood vessel; brain; cell culture; cell motion; cerebrovascular accident; confocal microscopy; cytology; female; genetics; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; knockout mouse; metabolism; nerve cell; neural stem cell; signal transduction; tissue scaffold; transgenic mouse; ultrastructure; vascularization; Animals; Antigens, CD29; Astrocytes; Blood Vessels; Brain; Cell Movement; Cells, Cultured; Coculture Techniques; Female; Laminin; Male; Mice, Inbred ICR; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Microscopy, Confocal; Microscopy, Electron; Neural Stem Cells; Neurons; Signal Transduction; Stroke; Tissue Scaffolds",2-s2.0-85011094614

However, how SE sensitization is involved in asthma, particularly nonatopic asthma and/or late-onset asthma, remains uncertain. Objective To clarify the involvement of SE sensitization in nonatopic and/or late-onset asthma and its association with a polymorphism of the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 gene (CysLTR1), which was examined because CysLT signaling is closely associated with late-onset eosinophilic asthma. Methods We assessed associations between sensitization to SE (A and/or B) and clinical indexes in 224 patients with asthma (mean age, 62.3 years; 171 women) from a cohort of the Kinki Hokuriku Airway Disease Conference, particularly those with nonatopic asthma (not sensitized to common aeroallergens) and/or late-onset asthma. Associations between SE sensitization and CysLTR1 polymorphism (rs2806489), a potential regulatory variant for atopic predisposition in women, were also assessed in a sex-stratified manner. Results A total of 105 patients (47%) with asthma were sensitized to SE. Among patients with nonatopic asthma (n?= 67) or with late-onset asthma (n?= 124), those sensitized to SE had significantly higher serum total IgE and periostin levels than those not sensitized. In nonatopic patients, a rapid decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 second was associated with SE sensitization.

Objective A multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial was conducted to investigate the therapeutic effect of high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG; 400?mg/kg/day for 5?days) in BP patients who showed no symptomatic improvement with prednisolone (?0.4?mg/kg/day) administered. Methods We evaluated the efficacy using the disease activity score on day15 (DAS15) as a primary endpoint, and changes in the DAS over time, the anti-BP180 antibody titer, and safety for a period of 57?days as secondary endpoints. Results We enrolled 56 patients in this study. The DAS15 was 12.5 points lower in the IVIG group than in the placebo group (p?=?0.089). The mean DAS of the IVIG group was constantly lower than that of the placebo group throughout the course of observation, and a post hoc analysis of covariance revealed a significant difference (p?=?0.041). Furthermore, when analyzed only in severe cases (DAS???40), the DAS15 differed significantly (p?=?0.046). The anti-BP180 antibody titers showed no difference between the two groups.

We assessed the hypothesis that an increased hypoxemic burden during sleep may have greater prognostic value than the frequency of apneic and hypopneic episodes. Methods and Results We prospectively conducted overnight cardiorespiratory polygraphy on consecutive HF patients referred to our hospital from 2008 to 2011. We studied CSA defined by an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of ?5 events/h with &gt;75% of all events being central in origin. We determined the AHI, proportion of the sleep time with SpO2 &lt;90% (T90%), and proportion of the recording time that 4% desaturation events occurred (4%POD). We studied 112 HF patients with either systolic or diastolic dysfunction. During a follow-up period of 37?±?25 months, 32 patients (29%) died. Nonsurvivors had a higher 4%POD compared with survivors (11?±?6.4% vs 19?±?13%; P?=?.001), but did not differ significantly from survivors regarding AHI and T90%. An adjusted logistic regression analysis revealed that the 4%POD was the best independent predictor of mortality. Conclusions The 4%POD, a novel metric for the nocturnal hypoxemic burden, is an independent prognostic marker in HF patients affected by CSA. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",heart failure; hypoxia and mortality; Sleep,"aged; apnea hypopnea index; Article; central sleep apnea syndrome; diastolic blood pressure; female; follow up; heart failure; human; hypoxemia; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; mortality; multichannel recorder; oxygen desaturation; predictive value; priority journal; prognostic assessment; sleep time; survivor; systolic blood pressure; cause of death; central sleep apnea syndrome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; comparative study; diastolic heart failure; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; nonparametric test; odds ratio; oximetry; oxygen consumption; physiology; polysomnography; procedures; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; risk assessment; severity of illness index; survival analysis; systolic heart failure; time factor; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cause of Death; Cohort Studies; Comorbidity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Failure, Diastolic; Heart Failure, Systolic; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Oximetry; Oxygen Consumption; Polysomnography; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Sleep Apnea, Central; Statistics, Nonparametric; Survival Analysis; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84999635761

However, there is no therapy to improve survival in HFpEF. Although observational cohort studies (OCSs) have examined the survival benefit of beta-blockers in HFpEF, the results are inconsistent due to limited power with small sample sizes and/or lack of adjustment for known confounders. Furthermore, recent randomized controlled trial (RCT)s failed to show the mortality benefit of beta-blockers in HFpEF. However, these RCTs were not adequately powered and thus the definite conclusion cannot be drawn. Methods and results We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of the effect of beta-blockers on mortality in HFpEF. The search of electronic databases identified 5 OCSs with propensity score (PS) analysis (12,315 patients), 6 OCSs without PS analysis (15,275 patients), and 3 RCTs (1046 patients). Beta-blocker use was associated with improved survival in the pooled analysis of OCSs with PS analysis (RR [95% CI] = 0.79 [0.66–0.95]) and in that of OCSs without PS analysis (0.70 [0.52–0.94]). In the pooled analysis of RCTs, beta-blocker use was associated with non-significant reduced risk for mortality (RR [95% CI] = 0.80 [0.61–1.05]). Overall, use of beta-blockers reduced the risk of mortality by 21% (RR [95% CI] = 0.79 [0.71–0.88]). Conclusion Our meta-analysis suggests the potential mortality benefit of beta-blockers in HFpEF. Well-designed and powered RCTs should be planned to confirm our observed potential survival benefit of beta-blockers in HFpEF. ? 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Beta-blockers; Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; Meta-analysis; Propensity score analysis,angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; Article; cardiovascular mortality; cohort analysis; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug use; follow up; heart failure; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; hospitalization; human; hypertension; meta analysis; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk reduction; survival; heart failure; heart stroke volume; mortality; observational study; pathophysiology; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Heart Failure; Humans; Mortality; Observational Studies as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stroke Volume,2-s2.0-84995814805

However, clinical differences and indications between the 2 types of SEMSs have not been elucidated. Methods We retrospectively compared 126 patients with U-SEMS and 126 patients with C-SEMSs with regard to clinical outcome and factors predictive of clinical improvement after SEMSs placement. Results No significant difference was observed between the U-SEMS and C-SEMS groups with respect to technical success, clinical success, GOO score, or time to stent dysfunction. Stent migration was significantly more frequent in patients with C-SEMSs (U-SEMSs,.79%; C-SEMSs, 8.73%; P?=.005). Karnofsky performance status, chemotherapy, peritoneal dissemination, and stent expansion?? 30% were associated significantly with poor GOO score improvement in multivariable analyses, but stent type was not (P?=.213). In subgroup analyses, insufficient (?30%) stent expansion was an independent factor in patients with U-SEMSs (P?=.041) but not C-SEMSs. In the insufficient stent expansion subgroup, C-SEMSs was associated significantly with superior clinical improvement compared with U-SEMSs (P?=.01). Insufficient stent expansion was observed more frequently in patients with GI obstruction because of anastomotic sites or metastatic cancer (44.8% [13/29], P?=.001). Conclusions No clinical difference, apart from stent migration, was observed between patients with U-SEMSs and C-SEMSs.

Standard therapy includes treatment with interferon (IFN); however, its efficacy is limited. HBV has been reported to impair IFN signaling; however, the mechanism is unclear. Here, the relationship between HBV X protein (HBx) and IFN signaling was investigated by establishing HepG2 cells, stably expressing HBx (HepG2/HBx) via retrovirus-mediated gene transfer. Subsequently, IFN negative-regulator expression and its mechanism were studied. HepG2/HBx cells showed reduced expression of IFN-stimulated genes and expressed higher levels of suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) suppressor compared with control cells. Knockdown of SOCS3 and PP2A restored IFN sensitivity. Moreover, HepG2/HBx cells showed higher phosphorylation levels of signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 and endoplasmic reticulum stress, which are inducers of SOCS3 and PP2A, respectively. Additionally, HBx-knockdown restored IFN sensitivity in HepG2.2.15.7 cells. It was also confirmed that SOCS3 and PP2A expression levels were up-regulated in the liver of patients with HBV infection. The results of this study demonstrated that HBx impairs IFN signaling via increased expression of SOCS3 and PP2A, a novel mechanistic insight, providing a potential therapeutic target to enhance the efficiency of IFN therapy.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oxaliplatin-based regimen (FOLFOX or XELOX) plus monoclonal antibodies (cetuximab or bevacizumab) treatment in patients with resectable CLM. Methods: A single-arm, open-label, multicenter, phase II trial was conducted for patients aged???20?years with resectable and untreated CLM. Patients received preoperative FOLFOX (6 cycles) or XELOX (4 cycles). Cetuximab or bevacizumab was administered to patients with wild-type or mutated KRAS codons 12 and 13, respectively. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Between January 2010 and June 2012, 47 patients were enrolled from 12 institutions. Wild-type or mutant KRAS sequences were examined in 32 and 15 patients, respectively. Twenty-one (45?%) patients experienced Grades 3/4 adverse events, and 55?% of all patients responded to therapy. The sizes of tumors of patients in the wild-type KRAS group were significantly reduced compared with those of the mutant KRAS group. The overall rates of liver resection and postoperative morbidity were 83 and 14?%, respectively, and the median PFS was 15.6?months. The median PFS times of the KRAS wild-type and mutant groups were 22.5?months and 10.5?months, respectively.

We report that a hybrid liposome composed of phospholipid (DPPC) and PEGylated block-copolymer (Poloxamer 188) can rapidly release an encapsulated hydrophilic drug in the presence of PLA2. DPPC/P188 liposomes released approximately 80% of the encapsulated calcein (a fluorescence marker) within 10 min in the presence of 120 mU of PLA2 at 37 °C in vitro, whereas several other liposomal compositions used for inhalation therapy did not. DPPC/P188 liposomes were stable in the absence of PLA2 at 37 °C after 60 min incubation and drug release by PLA2 was dependent on the amount of P188 incorporated into the DPPC liposomes. Drug release from doxorubicin (DOX, anticancer drug)-loaded DPPC/P188 liposomes was facilitated at higher PLA2 concentrations and was dependent on the temperature and the presence of calcium ion, thus partially explaining PLA2-responsive drug release. DOX release from liposomes triggered by PLA2 exhibited the same cytotoxic effects on the A549 lung cancer cell line as did DOX in free solution. These findings suggest that DPPC/P188 liposomes are a promising drug carrier for delivering drug efficiently at PLA2-expressing sites such as inflammatory lung cancer. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Inhalation formulation; Liposome; Lung cancer; Phospholipase A2; Poloxamer; Triggered release,"calcein; calcium ion; copolymer; doxorubicin; phospholipase A2; phospholipid; antineoplastic antibiotic; dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; doxorubicin; liposome; phospholipase A2; poloxamer; Article; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug formulation; drug release; enzyme activity; enzyme degradation; human; human cell; immune response; in vitro study; lipid membrane; lung cancer; lung cancer cell line; priority journal; temperature; A-549 cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effects; lung; Lung Neoplasms; metabolism; 1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine; A549 Cells; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Cell Survival; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Humans; Liposomes; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Phospholipases A2; Poloxamer",2-s2.0-85002375751

To evaluate the activation of the mTOR pathway, we performed western blot analysis to determine the expression levels of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein (phospho-S6 protein) in lymphoblastoid cell lines from 12 patients. Multiplex targeted sequencing analysis for 15 genes involved in the mTOR pathway was performed on 12 patients, and whole-exome sequencing was performed on one additional patient. Clinical features and MRI findings were also investigated. Results: We identified pathogenic mutations in six (AKT3, 1 patient; PIK3R2, 2 patients; PTEN, 3 patients) of the 13 patients. Increased expression of phospho-S6 protein was demonstrated in all five mutation-positive patients in whom western blotting was performed, as well as in three mutation-negative patients. Developmental delay, dysmorphic facial features were observed in almost all patients. Syndactyly/polydactyly and capillary malformations were not observed, even in patients with AKT3 or PIK3R2 mutations. There were no common phenotypes or MRI findings among these patients. Conclusions: A combination of genetic and biochemical methods successfully identified mTOR pathway involvement in nine of 13 (approximately 70%) patients with megalencephaly, indicating a major contribution of the pathway to the pathogenesis of megalencephaly. Our combined approach could be useful to identify patients who are suitable for future clinical trials using an mTOR inhibitor. ? 2017 The Author(s).",AKT3; MCAP; MPPH; Multiplex targeted sequencing; Phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein; PIK3R2; PTEN,"mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; phosphoprotein; protein kinase B; ribosome protein; S6 ribosomal protein; unclassified drug; AKT3 protein, human; MTOR protein, human; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; phosphoinositol-3 kinase regulatory subunit 2, human; protein kinase B; PTEN protein, human; S6 kinase; target of rapamycin kinase; adolescent; AKT3 gene; Alexander disease; Article; biochemical analysis; capillary malformation; child; clinical article; clinical feature; congenital blood vessel malformation; controlled study; developmental disorder; disease association; face dysmorphia; female; gene; gene identification; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic analysis; head circumference; human; human cell; lymphoblastoid cell line; male; neurologic disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phenotype; PIK3R2 gene; polydactyly; preschool child; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; PTEN gene; school child; sequence analysis; syndactyly; Western blotting; whole exome sequencing; cell line; DNA sequence; genetics; Megalencephaly; metabolism; mutation; phosphorylation; procedures; signal transduction; Adolescent; Cell Line; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Male; Megalencephaly; Mutation; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; PTEN Phosphohydrolase; Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Signal Transduction; TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases",2-s2.0-85009342944

During neurodegeneration, neuronal processes are impaired along with dysregulated post-translational modifications (PTMs) of cytoskeletal proteins. In neuronal processes, tubulin undergoes unique PTMs including a branched form of modification called glutamylation and loss of the C-terminal tyrosine residue and the penultimate glutamic acid residue forming Δ2-tubulin. Here, we investigated the state of two PTMs, glutamylation and Δ2 form, in both acute and slow-developing neurodegenerations, using a newly generated monoclonal antibody, DTE41, which had 2-fold higher affinity to glutamylated Δ2-tubulin, than to unmodified Δ2-tubulin. DTE41 recognised glutamylated Δ2-tubulin preferentially in immunostaining than in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting. In normal mouse brain, DTE41 stained molecular layer of the cerebellum as well as synapse-rich regions in pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex. In kainic acid-induced epileptic seizure, DTE41-labelled signals were increased in the hippocampal CA3 region, especially in the stratum lucidum. In the hippocampi of post-mortem patients with Alzheimer's disease, intensities of DTE41 staining were increased in mossy fibres in the CA3 region as well as in apical dendrites of the pyramidal neurons. Our findings indicate that glutamylation on Δ2-tubulin is increased in both acute and slow-developing neurodegeneration. ?

We tested the hypothesis that serum IL-6 level is a useful indicator of disease activity and predicts the treatment response to biologics in patients with psoriasis. Methods: We analyzed 113 psoriasis patients treated with biologics (73 with infliximab [IFX], 24 with adalimumab [ADA], and 16 with ustekinumab [UST]) in our hospital. Disease severity was assessed using the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score, and Disease Activity Score 28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP). Results: Before treatment, serum IL-6 levels significantly correlated with PASI scores in patients with psoriasis vulgaris (r = 0.432, p = 0.001) and with DAS28-CRP in patients with psoriatic arthritis (r = 0.469, p = 0.010). Serum IL-6 levels were significantly decreased by IFX (from 4.8 to 1.5) and ADA (from 2.5 to 1.4) therapy. In psoriatic arthritis, serum IL-6 levels at the endpoint tended to be lower in patients who achieved DAS28-CRP <2.3 (European League Against Rheumatism remission criteria) than in patients who did not. Conclusion: Serum IL-6 level may be a useful biomarker for assessing disease activity in patients with psoriasis and for predicting responsiveness of joint symptoms to biologic treatment. ? 2016 Japan College of Rheumatology.",Adalimumab; Infliximab; Interleukin-6; Psoriasis; Ustekinumab,"adalimumab; C reactive protein; infliximab; interleukin 6; ustekinumab; adalimumab; antirheumatic agent; biological marker; biological product; C reactive protein; cytokine; infliximab; interleukin 6; ustekinumab; adult; arthropathy; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; DAS28; disease severity; drug efficacy; female; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; psoriasis; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; psoriatic arthritis; treatment response; Arthritis, Psoriatic; blood; middle aged; psoriasis; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; Adalimumab; Adult; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Psoriatic; Biological Products; Biomarkers; C-Reactive Protein; Cytokines; Female; Humans; Infliximab; Interleukin-6; Male; Middle Aged; Psoriasis; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome; Ustekinumab",2-s2.0-84969699660

Methods: This survey was performed between December 2013 and February 2014. The study began with a preliminary survey to 123 otolaryngology institutions in Japan to inquire about their experiences with OMAAV patients during the past 10 years, and was followed by a questionnaire survey to investigate clinical and laboratory findings. OMAAV was defined using the criteria described in the text. Results: Two hundred and thirty-five patients classified as OMAAV were enrolled in this study. They were characterized as follows: (1) disease onset with initial signs/symptoms due to intractable otitis media with effusion or granulation, which did not respond to ordinary treatments such as antibiotics and insertion of tympanic ventilation tubes, followed by progressive hearing loss; (2) predominantly female (73%) and older (median age: 68 years); (3) predominantly myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA-positive (60%), followed by proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA-positive (19%) and both ANCAs-negative (16%); (4) frequently observed accompanying facial palsy (36%) and hypertrophic pachymeningitis (28%); and (5) disease often involving lung (35%) and kidney (26%) lesions. Four factors associated with OMAAV were found to be related to an unfavorable clinical course threatening the patient's hearing and/or lives, namely facial palsy, hypertrophic pachymeningitis, both ANCAs-negative phenotype, and disease relapse. The occurrence of hypertrophic pachymeningitis was associated with facial palsy (p < 0.05), both ANCAs-negative phenotype (p < 0.001), and headache (p < 0.001). The administration of corticosteroid together with an immunosuppressant was an independent predicting factor for lack of disease relapse (odds ratio [OR] = 1.90, p = 0.03) and an improvement in hearing loss (OR =2.58, p = 0.0002). Conclusion: Since OMAAV has novel clinical features, the disease may be categorized as a subentity for the classification of AAV. ? 2016 Japan College of Rheumatology.",Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis; Facial palsy; Granulomatosis with polyangiitis; Hypertrophic pachymeningitis; Microscopic polyangiitis; Myeloperoxidase-ANCA; Otitis media with ANCA-associated vasculitis; Proteinase 3 (PR3)-ANCA,"azathioprine; cyclophosphamide; cyclosporin; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; myeloblastin; myeloperoxidase; neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; prednisolone; tacrolimus; autoantibody; myeloblastin; neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody; peroxidase; adult; aged; ANCA associated vasculitis; Article; audiometry; clinical feature; conduction deafness; controlled study; disease association; dizziness; enzyme immunoassay; facial nerve paralysis; female; granulomatous inflammation; headache; histopathology; human; human tissue; Japan; major clinical study; male; mixed hearing loss; mortality; otalgia; otitis media; otorrhea; perception deafness; priority journal; relapse; retrospective study; subarachnoid hemorrhage; subdural hematoma; survival rate; treatment outcome; tympanostomy tube; age; Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis; complication; health survey; immunology; middle aged; otitis media; sex difference; treatment outcome; very elderly; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis; Antibodies, Antineutrophil Cytoplasmic; Autoantibodies; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Myeloblastin; Otitis Media; Peroxidase; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84966708471

Here, we report comprehensive molecular and clinical findings in 32 Japanese patients with TS14. Methods: We performed molecular studies for TS14 in 356 patients with variable phenotypes, and clinical studies in all TS14 patients, including 13 previously reported. Results: We identified 19 new patients with TS14, and the total of 32 patients was made up of 23 patients with maternal uniparental disomy (UPD(14)mat), six patients with epimutations, and three patients with microdeletions. Clinical studies revealed both Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS)-like marked hypotonia and Silver-Russell syndrome (SRS)-like phenotype in 50% of patients, PWS-like hypotonia alone in 20% of patients, SRS-like phenotype alone in 20% of patients, and nonsyndromic growth failure in the remaining 10% of patients in infancy, and gonadotropindependent precocious puberty in 76% of patients who were pubescent or older. Conclusion: These results suggest that TS14 is not only a genetically diagnosed entity but also a clinically recognizable disorder. Genetic testing for TS14 should be considered in patients with growth failure plus both PWS-like hypotonia and SRS-like phenotypes in infancy, and/or precocious puberty, as well as a familial history of Kagami- Ogata syndrome due to maternal microdeletion at 14q32.2. ?

Oxidative stress is involved in vascular inflammation, the process of atherosclerosis. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether the effects of oxidative stress on the arterial wall differ between smokers and non-smokers. Methods: Male smokers and non-smokers without physical deconditioning who visited Enshu hospital for an annual physical check-up were enrolled in the study. To assess oxidative stress, serum levels of derivative reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) were measured. The radial augmentation index (RAI) was measured using an automated device and was used as an index for arterial stiffness. Results: Univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis showed that RAI was independently associated with d-ROM levels only in smokers. Moreover, RAI was significantly higher in smokers than in non-smokers. Logistic regression analysis with the endpoint of a higher RAI than the mean revealed that older age (>65 years), hypertension, and smoking were independently associated with higher RAI. Similarly, logistic regression analysis with the endpoint of higher d-ROM levels than the mean showed that older age and smoking were independently associated with higher d-ROM levels. Conclusions: Increased RAI is significantly associated with smoking and, in smokers, with increased d-ROM levels. These results suggest that the effects of oxidative stress on arterial properties differ between smokers and non-smokers and that oxidative stress is closely associated with arterial stiffness, especially in smokers. ? 2017 Japan Atherosclerosis Society.",Arterial stiffness; Cigarette smoking; Oxidative stress; Radial augmentation index,cholesterol; hemoglobin; reactive oxygen metabolite; triacylglycerol; biological marker; adult; arterial pressure; arterial stiffness; Article; augmentation index; biochemical analysis; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; estimated glomerular filtration rate; human; hypertension; impaired glucose tolerance; major clinical study; male; medical examination; middle aged; obesity; oxidative stress; screening; smoking; arterial stiffness; cardiovascular disease; drug effect; follow up; oxidative stress; pathology; prognosis; risk factor; Biomarkers; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Oxidative Stress; Prognosis; Risk Factors; Smokers; Smoking; Vascular Stiffness,2-s2.0-85032927347

The Miami Declaration was signed at the G8 Environment Ministers Meeting in 1997 to promote children's environmental health research. The following ministerial meetings continued to emphasize the need to foster children's research. In response to such a worldwide movement, the Ministry of the Environment, Japan (MOE), launched a nationwide birth cohort study with 100,000 pairs of mothers and children, namely, the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS), in 2010. Other countries have also started or planned large-scale studies focusing on children's environmental health issues. The MOE initiated dialogue among those countries and groups to discuss and share the various processes, protocols, knowledge, and techniques for future harmonization and data pooling among such studies. The MOE formed the JECS International Liaison Committee in 2011, which plays a primary role in promoting the international collaboration between JECS and the other children's environmental health research projects and partnership with other countries. This review article aims to present activities that JECS has developed. As one of the committee's activities, a workshop and four international symposia were held between 2011 and 2015 in Japan. In these conferences, international researchers and government officials, including those from the World Health Organization, have made presentations on their own birth cohort studies and health policies. In 2015, the MOE hosted the International Advisory Board meeting and received constructive comments and recommendations from the board. JECS is a founding member of the Environment and Child Health International Birth Cohort Group, and has discussed harmonization of exposure and outcome measurements with member parties, which will make it possible to compare and further combine data from different studies, considering the diversity in the measurements of variables between the studies. JECS is expected to contribute to the international environmental health research community and policy-making. More international collaboration would enhance our understanding of the possible environmental causes of diseases and disabilities. ?

Previous reports have provided evidence that NOTCH1 is involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. Therefore, we sought to determine the mechanism by which NOTCH1 influences the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. We constructed a vector expressing the NOTCH1 intracellular domain (NICD1) and transfected the vector into HCT116 which has low expression of NICD1. Furthermore, inhibition of NOTCH signal pathway in SW480 which has abundant NICD1 expression, was performed by transfection of siNICD1 or DAPT, gamma secretase inhibitor, treatment. In addition, we evaluated NICD1 and β-catenin localization in colon cancer cell lines and in 189 colon cancer tissue samples and analyzed the correlation between the nuclear localization of NICD1 and the clinicopathological features of colon cancer patients. Results: Immunohistochemical assays demonstrated that NICD1 and β-catenin exhibited a similar localization pattern in colon cancer tissues. In addition, we found that NICD1 induced the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus and that NICD1 and β-catenin co-localized in the nucleus. Overexpression of NICD1 increased luciferase activity of Wnt signal pathway. On the other hand, reduction of NICD1 reduced luciferase activity of Wnt signaling pathway. In the 189 analyzed colon cancer cases, multivariate COX regression analysis demonstrated the independent prognostic impact of nuclear localization of NICD1(p=0.0376). Conclusion: NOTCH1 plays a key role in the Wnt pathway and activation of NOTCH1 is associated with the translocation of β-catenin to the nucleus. ?

We have previously shown that this marked increase is mostly due to an increase in the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive, HER2-negative subtype. We conducted a case-control study; ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer patients who were diagnosed since 2011 and women without disease were recruited. Environmental factors, serum levels of testosterone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and common genetic variants reported as predictors of ER-positive breast cancer or found in Asian women were evaluated between patients and controls in pre- and postmenopausal women. To identify important risk predictors, risk prediction models were created by logistic regression models. In premenopausal women, two environmental factors (history of breastfeeding, and history of benign breast disease) and four genetic variants (TOX3-rs3803662, ESR1-rs2046210, 8q24-rs13281615, and SLC4A7-rs4973768) were considered to be risk predictors, whereas three environmental factors (body mass index, history of breastfeeding, and hyperlipidemia), serum levels of testosterone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D, and two genetic variants (TOX3-rs3803662 and ESR1- rs2046210) were identified as risk predictors. Inclusion of common genetic variants and serum hormone measurements as well as environmental factors improved risk assessment models.

SDC can arise de novo or ex pleomorphic adenoma. To clarify the correlation of biomarker immunoprofile with clinicopathological findings and clinical outcome of SDC, we conducted immunohistochemistry for EGFR, HER2, HER3, AR, CK5/6, p53, and Ki-67, along with HER2 fluorescence in situ hybridization in 151 SDCs. SDCs ex pleomorphic adenoma more commonly overexpressed EGFR, HER2, HER3, and Ki-67 than de novo SDCs (P = 0.015, < 0.001, 0.045, and 0.02, respectively). In multivariate analysis, AR- and CK5/6+ were associated with shorter progression-free survival (P = 0.027 and 0.004, respectively). Moreover, patients with p53-extreme negative/positive demonstrated poorer overall survival (P = 0.007). On assessing the revised classification by the combination of biomarker expression, the percentages of each subtype were as follows: 'apocrine A' (AR+/HER2-/Ki-67-low) (24%), 'apocrine B' (AR+/HER2-/Ki-67-high) (18%), 'apocrine HER2' (AR+/HER2+) (35%), 'HER2-enriched' (AR-/HER2+) (12%), and 'double negative' (AR-/HER2-) (11%). 'Double negative' was further subclassified into 'basal-like' (EGFR and/or CK5/6+) (7%) and 'unclassified' (3%). Consequently, patients with 'apocrine A' showed a better progression-free survival than those with any other subtypes. Our revised immunoprofiling classification was valuable for predicting the survival and might be useful in personalized therapy for patients with SDC. ?

We compared the effects of light color on autonomic arousal level assessed by heart rate variability (HRV) and behavioral alertness by psychomotor vigilance tests (PVT). Heart rate was higher and high-frequency (HF, 0.150.45 Hz) power of HRV was lower during exposure to the blue light than to orange light. No significant difference with light color was observed, however, in any HRV indices during PVT or in PVT performance after light exposure.

We compared the autonomic and psychomotor arousal effects of melanopic-enriched blue light of organic light-emitting diode (OLED) with those of OLED lights with lesser absolute amount of melanopic component (green light) and with greater absolute but lesser relative content (white light). Methods: Using a ceiling light consisting of 120 panels (55 × 55 mm square) of OLED modules with adjustable color and brightness, we examined the effects of blue, green, and white lights (melanopic photon flux densities, 0.23, 0.14, and 0.38 μmol/m 2 /s and its relative content ratios, 72, 17, and 14%, respectively) on heart rate variability (HRV) during exposures and on the performance of psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) after exposures in ten healthy subjects with normal color vision. For each of the three colors, five consecutive 10-min sessions of light exposures were performed in the supine position, interleaved by four 10-min intervals during which 5-min PVT was performed under usual fluorescent light in sitting position. Low-frequency (LF, 0.04-0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, 0.15-0. 40 Hz) power and LF-to-HF ratio (LF/HF) of HRV during light exposures and reaction time (RT) and minor lapse (RT &gt;500 ms) of PVT were analyzed. Results: Heart rate was higher and the HF power reflecting autonomic resting was lower during exposures to the blue light than the green and white lights, while LF/HF did not differ significantly. Also, the number of minor lapse and the variation of reaction time reflecting decreased vigilance were lower after exposures to the blue light than the green light. Conclusions: The effects of blue OLED light for maintaining autonomic and psychomotor arousal levels depend on both absolute and relative contents of melanopic component in the light. ?

Methods We measured diethylphosphate (DE), dimethylphosphate (DM), and total dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites in maternal and child urine at 12 and 24 months of age and examined their relationship with developmental quotients (DQs) in 12-month-old infants and 24-month-old children in Shandong, China. Results The median concentrations of total DAP metabolites (DAPs) in child urine [371.97 nmol/g creatinine (12-month-old infants), 538.64 nmol/g creatinine (24-month-old children)] were higher than those in maternal urine (352.67 nmol/g creatinine). Prenatal OP exposure was negatively associated with 24-month-old children's DQs, especially among boys. A 10-fold increase in prenatal DEs and DAPs was associated with a 2.59- and 2.49-point decrease in social domain DQ scores in 24-month-old children (n = 262), respectively. However, positive association of postnatal exposure to OPs and 24-month-old children's DQs was observed (n = 237). Neither prenatal nor postnatal exposure to OPs was related to 12-month-old infants’ DQs. Conclusions These data suggested that prenatal OP exposure could adversely affect children's neurodevelopment at 24 months of age, especially among boys. The prenatal period might be a critical window of OP exposure. In view of the positive association with postnatal OP exposure, it is necessary to interpret findings with caution. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",China; Neurodevelopment; Organophosphate pesticides; Postnatal exposure; Prenatal exposure,Body fluids; Metabolites; China; Neurodevelopment; Organophosphate pesticides; Postnatal exposure; Prenatal exposure; Pesticides; dialkylphosphate; diethylphosphate; dimethylphosphate; lead; mercury; organophosphate pesticide; perfluoroalkyl; polyfluoroalkyl; pyrethroid; unclassified drug; creatinine; diethyl phosphate; dimethyl phosphate; organophosphate; organophosphorus compound; pesticide; child health; health impact; maternal health; organophosphorus pesticide; urine; adaptive behavior; adult; Article; child; China; cohort analysis; concentration (parameters); controlled study; creatinine urine level; developmental delay; exposure; female; human; infant; intelligence quotient; language; limit of detection; limit of quantitation; longitudinal study; male; motor performance; nerve cell differentiation; occupational exposure; postnatal exposure; prenatal exposure; priority journal; signal noise ratio; smoking; social environment; chemically induced; child development; drug effects; mental disease; pregnancy; prenatal exposure; urine; China; Shandong; Animalia; Adult; Child Development; China; Cohort Studies; Creatinine; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Organophosphates; Organophosphorus Compounds; Pesticides; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects,2-s2.0-85027880957

Several studies have suggested that the Gram stain of endotracheal aspirates is a useful method for accurately diagnosing VAP. However, the usefulness of the Gram stain in predicting which microorganisms cause VAP has not been established. The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether a Gram stain of endotracheal aspirates could be used to determine appropriate initial antimicrobial therapy for VAP. Methods: Data on consecutive episodes of microbiologically confirmed VAP were collected from February 2013 to February 2016 in the ICU of a tertiary care hospital in Japan. We constructed two hypothetical empirical antimicrobial treatment algorithms for VAP: a guidelines-based algorithm (GLBA) based on the recommendations of the American Thoracic Society-Infectious Diseases Society of America (ATS-IDSA) guidelines and a Gram stain-based algorithm (GSBA) which limited the choice of initial antimicrobials according to the results of bedside Gram stains. The GLBA and the GSBA were retrospectively reviewed for each VAP episode. The initial coverage rates and the selection of broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents were compared between the two algorithms. Results: During the study period, 219 suspected VAP episodes were observed and 131 episodes were assessed for analysis. Appropriate antimicrobial coverage rates were not significantly different between the two algorithms (GLBA 95.4% versus GSBA 92.4%; p = 0.134). The number of episodes for which antimethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus agents were selected as an initial treatment was larger in the GLBA than in the GSBA (71.0% versus 31.3%; p < 0.001), as were the number of episodes for which antipseudomonal agents were recommended as an initial treatment (70.2% versus 51.9%; p < 0.001). Conclusions: Antimicrobial treatment based on Gram stain results may restrict the administration of broadspectrum antimicrobial agents without increasing the risk of treatment failure. ?

We previously reported the potential therapeutic role of osteopontin (OPN) and macrophages in CaOx kidney stone formation, discovered using genome-recombined mice and genome-wide analyses. Here, to characterize the genetic pathogenesis of RPs, we used microarrays and immunohistology to compare gene expression among renal papillary RP and non-RP tissues of 23 CaOx stone formers (SFs) (age- and sex-matched) and normal papillary tissue of seven controls. Transmission electron microscopy showed OPN and collagen expression inside and around RPs, respectively. Cluster analysis revealed that the papillary gene expression of CaOx SFs differed significantly from that of controls. Disease and function analysis of gene expression revealed activation of cellular hyperpolarization, reproductive development, and molecular transport in papillary tissue from RPs and non-RP regions of CaOx SFs. Compared with non-RP tissue, RP tissue showed upregulation (>2-fold) of LCN2, IL11, PTGS1, GPX3, and MMD and downregulation (0.5-fold) of SLC12A1 and NALCN (P<0.01). In network and toxicity analyses, these genes associated with activated mitogenactivated protein kinase, the Akt/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase pathway, and proinflammatory cytokines that cause renal injury and oxidative stress. Additionally, expression of proinflammatory cytokines, numbers of immune cells, and cellular apoptosis increased in RP tissue. This study establishes an association between genes related to renal dysfunction, proinflammation, oxidative stress, and ion transport and RP development in CaOx SFs.

IPAH is pathologically characterized as sustained vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling of the pulmonary artery. Vascular remodeling is mediated by enhanced proliferation and reduced apoptosis in pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs). Based on its pathological mechanism, specific phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5) inhibitors have been used in the treatment of IPAH. In addition to sildenafil, tadalafil has been approved for the treatment of IPAH. However, the effects of tadalafil on excessive proliferation of IPAH-PASMCs currently remain unknown. In the present study, the in vitro pharmacological profiles of tadalafil for cell proliferation and apoptosis were assessed in IPAH-PASMCs using MTT, BrdU incorporation, and caspase 3/7 assays. Expression analyses revealed that PDE5 mRNA and protein expression levels were markedly higher in IPAH-PASMCs than in normal-PASMCs. The treatment with tadalafil inhibited the excessive proliferation of IPAH-PASMCs in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 4.5?μM. On the other hand, tadalafil (0.03–100?μM) did not affect cell growth of PASMCs from normal subjects and patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). In addition, tadalafil induced apoptosis in IPAH-PASMCs. The antiproliferative and apoptotic effects of tadalafil were markedly stronger than those of sildenafil and vardenafil. The upregulated expression of PDE5 in IPAH-PASMCs was significantly attenuated by a long-term treatment with tadalafil. Taken together, these results indicate that tadalafil attenuates vascular remodeling by inhibiting cell proliferation, promoting apoptosis, and downregulating PDE5 in IPAH-PASMCs, thereby ameliorating IPAH. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Phosphodiesterase type 5; Pulmonary artery; Pulmonary hypertension; Smooth muscle; Tadalafil; Vascular remodeling,"broxuridine; caspase 3; caspase 7; messenger RNA; phosphodiesterase V; sildenafil; tadalafil; vardenafil; phosphodiesterase V; phosphodiesterase V inhibitor; tadalafil; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell viability; chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension; concentration (parameters); concentration response; controlled study; down regulation; drug effect; enzyme assay; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; MTT assay; priority journal; protein expression; pulmonary hypertension; upregulation; apoptosis; cell line; down regulation; drug effects; enzymology; genetics; pathology; pulmonary artery; pulmonary hypertension; smooth muscle cell; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 5; Down-Regulation; Familial Primary Pulmonary Hypertension; Humans; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Phosphodiesterase 5 Inhibitors; Pulmonary Artery; Tadalafil",2-s2.0-85020657316

PtCQ is synthesized by mixing platinum and chloroquine diphosphate (CQ). This study examines two efficient methods for forming a nanodrug, PtCQ-loaded liposomes, for use as a potential antimalarial drug-delivery system: the thin drug-lipid film method to incorporate the drug into a liposomal membrane, and a remote-loading method to load the drug into the interior of a cationic liposome. The membranes accordingly comprised PEGylated neutral or cationic liposomes. PtCQ was efficiently loaded into PEGylated neutral and cationic liposomes using the thin drug-lipid film method (encapsulation efficiency, EE: 76.1±6.7% for neutral liposomes, 1 : 14 drug-to-lipid weight ratio; 70.4±9.8% for cationic liposomes, 1 : 14 drug-to-lipid weight ratio). More PtCQ was loaded into PEGylated neutral liposomes using the remote-loading method than by the thin drug-lipid film method and the EE was maximum (96.1±4.5% for neutral liposomes, 1 : 7 (w/w)). PtCQ was encapsulated in PEGylated cationic liposomes comprising various amounts of cationic lipids (0-20 mol%; EE: 96.9-92.3%) using the remote-loading method.

S. pneumoniae frequently forms the biofilm to prevent severe circumstances such as antimicrobial agents. Shin'iseihaito (xinyiqingfeitang) is a formula of Japanese traditional Kampo medicine that has 9 crude drugs and provides the medicinal usage for sinusitis. The objective of the present study is to reveal the mechanism of antibiofilm activity by Shin'iseihaito extract (SSHT). SSHT significantly inhibited the formation of biofilm from S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 in dose- and time-dependent manners. SSHT also significantly suppressed the biofilm formation by other five different cps types of S. pneumoniae clinical isolates. We found that the extracts of 8 out of 9 components in Shin'iseihaito had the inhibitory effects of biofilm formation, and the extract of the root of Scutellaria baicalensis had the strongest effect among the ingredients of Shin'iseihaito. We found that the capsule of SSHT-treated S. pneumoniae was significantly thinner than that of the untreated group and that SSHT reduced the hydrophobicity of bacterial cell surface. Our results suggest that Shin'iseihaito may be a useful agent for the treatment of S. pneumoniae-induced sinusitis because of the inhibition of biofilm formation of S. pneumoniae. ? 2017 Masaaki Minami et al.",,"antibiotic agent; kampo; shin iseihaito; unclassified drug; herbaceous agent; Article; bacterial capsule; bacterial cell; bacterial membrane; biofilm; cell surface; confocal laser scanning microscopy; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; loquat; nonhuman; phase separation; quorum sensing; room temperature; Scutellaria baicalensis; staining; Streptococcus pneumoniae; biofilm; drug effects; human; Kampo medicine; physiology; procedures; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Biofilms; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Humans; Medicine, Kampo; Streptococcus pneumoniae",2-s2.0-85018954800

Methods A retrospective observational study was conducted by reviewing the medical charts and autopsy reports of 204 patients who were admitted to hospital, underwent a post-mortem examination, and who were neuropathologically diagnosed with dementia. The risk factors for pneumonia-caused death were examined both as underlying and immediate causes of death using logistic regression models. Results A high frequency of pneumonia-caused death was observed both in underlying- (37.3%) and immediate- (44.1%) cause of death, but varied according to the subtypes of dementia. The factors related to pneumonia-caused death (underlying) were subtypes of dementia; Alzheimer’s disease (odds ratio [OR], 2.891; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.459-5.730); argyrophilic grain disease (OR, 3.148; 95% CI, 0.937-10.577); and progressive supranuclear palsy (OR, 34.921; 95% CI, 3.826-318.775), dysphagia (OR, 2.045; 95% CI, 1.047-3.994), diabetes mellitus (OR, 3.084; 95% CI, 1.180-8.061) and conversely related with heart failure (OR, 0.149; 95% CI, 0.026-0.861). Factors relating to pneumonia-caused death (immediate) were incidence of pneumonia during hospitalizations (OR, 32.579; 95%CI, 4.308-246.370), gender-male (OR, 2.060; 95% CI, 1.098-3.864), and conversely related with malignant neoplasm (OR, 0.220; 95% CI, 0.058-0.840).

This was the multi-institutional non-randomized phase II study. Patients with histologically proven local failure limited within the muscularis propria after 50Gy or more radiotherapy (RT) for esophageal cancer were eligible. We set the primary endpoint as local complete response (L-CR) per patients.

Since LSD1 is implicated in the tumorigenesis and progression of various cancers, LSD1-specific inhibitors are considered as potential anti-cancer agents. A modified H3 peptide with substitution of Lys4 to Met [H3K4M] is already known to be a potent competitive inhibitor of LSD1. In this study, we synthesized a series of H3K4M peptide derivatives and evaluated their LSD1-inhibitory activities in vitro. We found that substitutions of the N-terminal amino acid with amino acids having a larger side chain were generally not tolerated, but substitution of Ala1 to Ser unexpectedly resulted in more potent inhibitory activity toward LSD1. X-ray crystallographic analysis of H3K4M derivatives bound to the LSD1·CoREST complex revealed the presence of additional hydrogen bonding between the N-terminal Ser residue of the H3 peptide derivative and LSD1. The present structural and biochemical findings will be helpful for obtaining more potent peptidic inhibitors of LSD1. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Crystal structure; Enzyme inhibitors; Epigenetics; Peptides; Protein structure,"alanine; antineoplastic agent; H3K4M peptide derivative; unclassified drug; corepressor protein; enzyme inhibitor; histone; histone demethylase; KDM1A protein, human; ligand; nerve protein; peptide; RCOR1 protein, human; amino acid substitution; amino terminal sequence; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; crystal structure; crystallization; drug design; drug structure; drug synthesis; hydrogen bond; in vitro study; structure activity relation; structure analysis; X ray crystallography; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; human; structure activity relation; synthesis; Amino Acid Substitution; Co-Repressor Proteins; Crystallography, X-Ray; Enzyme Inhibitors; Histone Demethylases; Histones; Humans; Hydrogen Bonding; Ligands; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Peptides; Structure-Activity Relationship",2-s2.0-85015755789

However, little is known about whether the prognostic impact of alcohol consumption differs by treatment method. We evaluated the association between alcohol drinking and survival by treatment method to the primary site in 427 patients with HNSCC treated between 2005 and 2013 at Aichi Cancer Center Central Hospital (Nagoya, Japan). The impact of alcohol on prognosis was measured by multivariable Cox regression analysis adjusted for established prognostic factors. Among all HNSCC patients, the overall survival rate was significantly poorer with increased levels of alcohol consumption in multivariable analysis (trend P = 0.038). Stratification by treatment method and primary site revealed that the impact of drinking was heterogeneous. Among laryngopharyngeal cancer (laryngeal, oropharyngeal, and hypopharyngeal cancer) patients receiving radiotherapy (n = 141), a significant dose–response relationship was observed (trend P = 0.034). In contrast, among laryngopharyngeal cancer patients treated with surgery (n = 80), no obvious impact of alcohol was observed. This heterogeneity in the impact of alcohol between surgery and radiotherapy was significant (for interaction, P = 0.048). Furthermore, among patients with oral cavity cancer treated by surgery, a significant impact of drinking on survival was seen with tongue cancer, but not with non-tongue oral cancer.

We conducted a multi-institutional retrospective cohort study of 140 SDC patients. The survival impact of these hematological markers was evaluated using multivariate proportional hazard models. High mGPS (?1) was significantly associated with worse survival (3-year overall survival (OS): 16.7% vs 66.1%, p-value=0.003; 3-year progression-free survival (PFS): 0.0% vs 27.9%, p-value < 0.001). Additionally, high C-reactive protein (CRP) (?0.39 mg/dl) was significantly associated with worse survival (3-year OS: 32.1% vs 68.2%, p-value=0.001; 3-year PFS: 7.1% vs 31.1%, p-value < 0.001). These associations were consistent with multivariate analysis adjusted for established prognostic factors. Although we also found significant association of high NLR (?2.5) with OS (HR 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-3.08) in multivariate analysis, this association were inconsistent with the results of PFS. In addition, we found no significant associations of PLR with survival. In conclusion, we found that mGPS, CRP and NLR were identified as prognostic factors associated with survival in SDC patients.",CRP; MGPS; NLR; Salivary duct carcinoma; Survival,C reactive protein; adult; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cohort analysis; female; human; Japan; major clinical study; male; modified Glasgow Prognostic Score; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; overall survival; platelet lymphocyte ratio; progression free survival; retrospective study; scoring system,2-s2.0-85009727622

The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of a volume of interest (VOI) analysis on the principles of echo shifting with a train of observations (PRESTO) imaging using the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8 and the WFU PickAtlas program for the diagnosis of Parkinsonian syndrome. Methods: Fifty subjects, including 13 with the Parkinsonian variant of multiple system atrophy (MSA-P), 12 with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), 12 with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 13 controls were evaluated in this study. After the spatial normalization of PRESTO images on SPM8, the WFU PickAtlas program was performed to create target VOIs in the putamen, red nucleus, substantia nigra, subthalamic nucleus, and dentate nucleus. The signal intensity ratio (SIR) was calculated by normalizing the signal of each VOI to that of the cerebrospinal fluid space. These SIRs were used as determinants in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Results: SIR of the putamen was significantly lower in MSA-P than in PSP (P = 0.0051) and controls (P = 0.0004). In contrast, SIR of the red nucleus was significantly lower in PSP than in MSA-P (P = 0.0003), PD (P = 0.0029), and controls (P = 0.0011). In ROC analyses, SIR of the putamen exhibited the highest areas under the curves (AUCs) of 0.83 (vs. PSP) and 0.91 (vs. controls) in the diagnosis of MSA-P. On the other hand, SIR of the red nucleus exhibited the highest AUCs of 0.87 (vs. MSA-P), 0.90 (vs. PD), and 0.89 (vs. controls) in the diagnosis of PSP. Conclusions: The VOI analysis based on spatially normalized PRESTO images may be useful for depicting hypointensity, indicative of abnormal iron depositions, of the putamen and red nucleus in the diagnosis of MSA-P and PSP. ?2016 Japanese Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.",Atypical Parkinsonian syndrome (APS); Multiple system atrophy (MSA); Principles of echo shifting with a train of observations (PRESTO); Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP); Statistical parametric mapping (SPM),"aged; area under the curve; brain; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; female; human; image processing; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; pathology; procedures; progressive supranuclear palsy; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; Shy Drager syndrome; Aged; Area Under Curve; Brain; Brain Mapping; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple System Atrophy; Parkinson Disease; Parkinsonian Disorders; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Supranuclear Palsy, Progressive",2-s2.0-85009192378

Aberrant methylation-induced silencing of ASC has been observed in a variety of cancer cells, thus implicating ASC in tumor suppression, although this role remains incompletely defined especially in the context of closely neighboring cell proliferation. As ASC has been confirmed to be silenced by abnormal methylation in HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells as well, this cell line was investigated to characterize the precise role and mechanism of ASC in tumor progression. The effects of ASC were examined using in vitro cell cultures based on comparisons between low and high cell density conditions as well as in a xenograft murine model. ASC overexpression was established by insertion of the ASC gene into pcDNA3 and pMX-IRES-GFP vectors, the latter being packed into a retrovirus and subjected to reproducible competitive assays using parental cells as an internal control, for evaluation of cell viability. p21 and p53 were silenced using shRNA. Cell viability was suppressed in ASCexpressing transfectants as compared with control cells at high cell density conditions in in vitro culture and colony formation assays and in in vivo ectopic tumor formation trials. This suppression was not detected in low cell density conditions. Furthermore, remarkable progression of apoptosis was observed in ASC-introduced cells at a high cell density, but not at a low one. ASC-dependent apoptosis was mediated not by p21, p53, or caspase-1, but rather by cleavage of caspase-9 as well as by suppression of the NF-κB-related X-linked inhibitor-of-Apoptosis protein. Caspase-9 cleavage was observed to be dependent on gap junction formation. The remarkable effect of ASC on the induction of apoptosis through caspase- 9 and gap junctions revealed in this study may lead to promising new approaches in anticancer therapy. ? 2017 Kitazawa et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, andreproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.",,"adaptor protein; apoptosis associated speck-like protein containing a CARD; caspase 9; interleukin 1beta converting enzyme; messenger RNA; protein p21; protein p53; unclassified drug; X linked inhibitor of apoptosis; caspase 9; connexin 43; cytoskeleton protein; protein p53; PYCARD protein, human; Rho guanine nucleotide binding protein; small interfering RNA; TP53 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; ASC gene; carcinogenesis; cell communication; cell density; cell proliferation; cell viability; colony formation; controlled study; enzyme activation; gap junction; gene; gene expression; human; human cell; in vitro study; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein function; tumor xenograft; apoptosis; cell communication; cell survival; gap junction; genetics; immunohistochemistry; metabolism; physiology; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tumor cell line; TUNEL assay; Western blotting; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Caspase 9; Cell Communication; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Connexin 43; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Gap Junctions; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; RNA, Small Interfering; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53",2-s2.0-85008615997

Materials and methods We evaluated 291 patients (178 men and 113 women; mean age, 65.9?±?13.5 years). Clinicopathological data, time of development of level IV/V metastases, and clinical course were investigated. Results Twenty-three patients (7.9%) developed level IV/V metastases. The 3-year overall survival rates when level IV/V metastasis first developed were 27.3% upon initial treatment, 57.1% when metachronous neck metastasis developed, and 40.0% when the tumor recurred. Oral tongue tumor subsite, high N staging, neck dissection when metachronous neck metastasis developed, as well as recurrence were independent risk factors for level IV/V metastasis. Conclusion We demonstrate here the multivariate relationships among the risk factors indicated above for level IV/V metastasis and their prognostic significance for patients with OSCC. Oral tongue tumors, high N staging, and neck dissection upon the occurrence of metachronous neck metastasis or recurrence were risk factors for level IV/V metastasis and positive extracapsular spread, presence of multiple lymph metastases, and moderate or poor differentiation were poor prognostic factors. ? 2016 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery",Lymph node metastasis; Neck level; Oral cancer; Risk factor,"antineoplastic agent; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; chemoradiotherapy; clinical evaluation; controlled study; disease course; female; human; major clinical study; male; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; multimodality cancer therapy; neck dissection; neck metastasis; observational study; outcome assessment; overall survival; retrospective study; tongue tumor; middle aged; mouth tumor; pathology; prognosis; squamous cell carcinoma; survival analysis; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85007324642

The aim of this study was to examine the effects of oral branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) supplementation on liver function, intrahepatic recurrence rate, and incidence of complications after RFA for HCC. Methods Patients with cirrhosis who underwent RFA were enrolled between August 2009 and April 2012, randomized to oral supplementation with Aminoleban EN (BCAA group) or diet?alone (control group), and followed to determine changes in serum parameters and health status. Patients in the BCAA group were instructed to ingest a packet of Aminoleban EN twice daily. Levels of physical and mental stress were assessed using the Short Form-8 health survey. Oral BCAA and dietary interventions were initiated 2?wk before local therapy, and contrast-enhanced computed tomography was performed every 3?mo to assess recurrence. Results We evaluated 25 patients in the BCAA group and 26 in the control group. The median follow-up period was 3.9?y (736–1818?d). There were no significant differences between the two groups in basal characteristics. Complications were less frequent in the BCAA group (P?=?0.03). Event-free survival was significantly higher in the BCAA group, whereas the intrahepatic recurrence rate was significantly lower (P?=?0.04 and 0.036, respectively). A significant improvement in the Short Form-8 mental component score was observed in the BCAA group only (P?<?0.01).

Methods: Forty-six retinal specialists were administered a survey regarding the pathology and clinical practice of DME. Results: Nearly, half of the specialists (45.2?%) think that the main biochemical factor involved in DME development is the vascular permeability-potentiating action of VEGF-A. Most specialists (70.6?%) use three modalities for detecting DME: optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and fundus examination. For focal macular edema, focal laser is used as first-line therapy by 70.3?% of specialists, whereas 21.6?% use medical treatment in combination with focal/grid laser. For diffuse macular edema, anti-VEGF therapy is the first choice (72.5?%), irrespective of visual acuity, whereas 17.5?% select off-label sub-Tenon’s steroid injections. Vitrectomy is often performed for vitreomacular traction (86.5?%) or when anti-VEGF agent/laser therapy is ineffective (73.2?%). For persistent DME after vitrectomy, anti-VEGF agents (46.3?%) or steroids (intravitreal injections, 14.6?%; sub-Tenon’s injections, 36.6?%) are selected. When applying anti-VEGF treatment regimen, most specialists continue loading injections until central retinal thickness stabilized (51.4?%) or both visual acuity and central retinal thickness stabilized (24.3?%). In the maintenance phase, many specialists provide injections with pro re nata (76.3?%), whereas 50.0?% responded that the treat-and-extend regimen is ideal.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of obesity on sperm retrieval outcome and reproductive hormone levels in Japanese men with non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA). This study is based on the clinical records of 217 men [172 with a 46,XY karyotype, 45 with Klinefelter syndrome (KS)] with NOA who underwent microdissection testicular sperm extraction at Nagoya City University Hospital between January 2004 and December 2014. Body mass index (BMI) and serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and total testosterone (TT) were measured in all patients. In a subset of patients, bioavailable testosterone (cBAT) also was calculated. Values were evaluated separately in patients with and without KS. Sperm retrieval rates (SRRs) in 46,XY men with a BMI &lt;25?kg/m2 and ?25?kg/m2 were 29.3% and 18.4%, respectively (p?=?0.142), while SRRs in KS men with a BMI &lt;25?kg/m2 and ?25?kg/m2 were 25.0% and 35.3%, respectively (p?=?0.460). TT level in men with a BMI ?25?kg/m2 was lower than that in men with a BMI &lt;25?kg/m2, regardless of KS status. According to Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients, TT and cBAT levels tended to have negative correlations with BMI; however, statistical significance was observed only for TT level in 46,XY men (r?=?0.340, p?&lt;?0.001). LH and FSH levels were negatively correlated with BMI in KS men (r?=??0.466, p?=?0.001 and r?=??0.647, p?&lt;?0.001, respectively), but not in 46,XY men. These results suggest that obesity may be irrelevant to sperm retrieval outcome in patients with NOA. The negative correlations between gonadotropins and BMI in patients with KS suggest an underlying suppressive effect on gonadotropin excretion, which is distinctive in obese patients with KS. ? 2016 American Society of Andrology and European Academy of Andrology",gonadotrophins; Klinefelter syndrome; obesity; TESE/TESA; testosterone,"follitropin; gonadotropin; luteinizing hormone; testosterone; follitropin; luteinizing hormone; testosterone; Article; azoospermia; body height; body mass; body weight; controlled study; follitropin blood level; gonadotropin blood level; human; Japanese (people); karyotype 46,XY; Klinefelter syndrome; luteinizing hormone blood level; major clinical study; male; obesity; priority journal; sperm retrieval; testosterone blood level; treatment outcome; adult; blood; complication; Japan; Klinefelter syndrome; obesity; semen analysis; sperm retrieval; Adult; Azoospermia; Body Mass Index; Follicle Stimulating Hormone; Humans; Japan; Klinefelter Syndrome; Luteinizing Hormone; Male; Obesity; Semen Analysis; Sperm Retrieval; Testosterone",2-s2.0-84988662559

We evaluated whether ginsenosides Rb1 and Rg1, and their metabolites from enteric bacteria act as substrates of sodium-glucose cotransporter (SGLT) 1, the major glucose transporter expressed on the apical side of intestinal epithelial cells. First, we evaluated the competing effects of ginseng extract and ginsenosides on the uptake of [14C]methyl-glucose, a substrate of SGLT1, by SGLT1-overexpressing HEK293 cells. A boiling water extract of ginseng inhibited SGLT1 in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 0.85?mg/ml. By activity-guided fractionation, we determined that the fraction containing ginsenosides displayed an inhibitory effect on SGLT1. Of the ginsenosides evaluated, protopanaxatriol-type ginsenosides were not found to inhibit SGLT1, whereas protopanaxadiol-type ginsenosides, including ginsenosides Rd, Rg3, Rh2, F2 and compound K, exhibited significant inhibitory effects on SGLT1, with ginsenoside F2 having the highest activity with an IC50 value of 23.0??M. Next, we measured the uptake of ginsenoside F2 and compound K into Caco-2 cells, a cell line frequently used to evaluate the intestinal absorption of drugs. The uptake of ginsenoside F2 and compound K into Caco-2 cells was not competitively inhibited by glucose. Furthermore, the uptake of ginsenoside F2 and compound K into SGLT1-overexpressing HEK293 cells was not significantly higher than into mock cells. Ginsenoside F2 and compound K did not appear to be substrates of SGLT1, although these compounds could inhibit SGLT1. Ginsenosides might be absorbed by passive diffusion through the intestinal membrane or actively transported via unknown transporters other than SGLT1. ? 2016, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan.",Diabetes; Ginsenosides; Glucose transporter; Panax ginseng; SGLT1,ginseng extract; ginsenoside; ginsenoside Rb 1; ginsenoside Rd; ginsenoside Rf; ginsenoside Rg 1; ginsenoside Rg 3; sodium glucose cotransporter 1; ginsenoside; sodium glucose cotransporter 1; Article; controlled study; drug structure; embryo; ginseng; HEK293 cell line; human; human cell; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; plant root; chemistry; metabolism; Panax; Ginsenosides; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Panax; Plant Roots; Sodium-Glucose Transporter 1,2-s2.0-84987620751

The present article reviews the epidemiology, pathophysiology and potential treatment of urolithiasis. Recent literature has shown that oxidative stress and reactive oxygen species could be one such mechanistic pathway. Calcium oxalate crystals adhering to renal tubular cells are incorporated into the cells through the involvement of osteopontin. Stimulation of crystal–cell adhesion impairs acceleration of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore in tubular cells, resulting in mitochondrial collapse, oxidative stress and activation of the apoptotic pathway in the initial steps of renal calcium crystallization. With regard to genetic factors, studies show that single nucleotide polymorphisms in genes encoding calcium-sensing receptor, vitamin D receptor and osteopontin are correlated with urolithiasis. Genome-wide association studies have shown that CLDN14 and NPT2 are associated with urolithiasis in Caucasian and Japanese populations, respectively. Thus, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis would aid in the prediction of urolithiasis risk and recurrence. New diagnostic methods and preventive approaches, along with complete removal of stones, will improve the management of urolithiasis. ? 2016 The Japanese Urological Association",calcium oxalate; kidney calculi; mitochondria; nephrolithiasis; oxidative stress; urolithiasis,"calcium; calcium oxalate; calcium sensing receptor; claudin; claudin 14; cyclosporin A; cyclosporin A [4 n methylisoleucine]; mitochondrial permeability transition pore; osteopontin; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma agonist; pioglitazone; reactive oxygen metabolite; recombinant adiponectin; recombinant protein; sodium phosphate cotransporter 2; unclassified drug; vitamin D receptor; pioglitazone; reactive oxygen metabolite; apoptosis; calcium oxalate stone; Caucasian; cell adhesion; cell damage; correlational study; crystal; crystallization; diagnostic procedure; epidemiological data; genome-wide association study; heredity; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; incidence; Japanese (people); kidney cell; kidney injury; kidney tubule cell; nephrolithiasis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pathophysiology; priority journal; recurrent disease; Review; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; stone formation; urinary tract; urolithiasis; animal; cardiovascular disease; cholesterol intake; chronic kidney failure; complication; cytology; disease model; drug effect; genetic predisposition; genetics; kidney tubule; lipid metabolism; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrion; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathology; urolithiasis; Animals; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholesterol, Dietary; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Models, Animal; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Incidence; Kidney Tubules; Lipid Metabolism; Metabolic Syndrome; Mitochondria; Mitochondrial Membranes; Oxidative Stress; Pioglitazone; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reactive Oxygen Species; Recurrence; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Urolithiasis",2-s2.0-84982267314

Methods: Overall, 641 patients enrolled in Japan with HCV-1b received DCV and ASV for 24?weeks. Baseline drug-resistant mutations L31F/I/M/V, Q54H, P58S, A92K, and Y93H in the HCV NS5A region and V36A, T54A/S, Q80K/L/R, R155K/T/Q, A156S/V/T, and D168A/E/H/T/V in the HCV NS3/4A region were assessed by direct sequencing. Results: Overall, 86.9?% (543/625) of patients had SVR12, which was significantly higher in NS5A 93Y (wild) (88.3?%) compared with NS5A 93H at baseline (48.0?%), indicating the SVR12 rate was significantly lower in patients with 93H mutations. Additionally, 66.7?% (18/27) of patients with prior triple therapy including simeprevir (SMV) failure had virological failure. The virological failure rate of DCV/ASV therapy after SMV failure was significantly higher in those with preexisting NS3/4A 168 substitutions compared with without substitutions at baseline [84.2?% (16/19) vs. 28.6?% (2/7), p?=?0.014]. The number of patients with multiple RAVs or deletions in NS5A increased from 0 to 85?% in failed patients. Alanine aminotransferase elevation was a frequent adverse event causing discontinuation of DCV/ASV therapy, although 87.5?% (14/16) patients achieved SVR12, subsequently. Conclusions: History of SMV therapy and pre-existing NS5A Y93H were associated with virological failure of DCV/ASV therapy, resulting in the emergence of multiple RAVs.

This study focused on the effect of PGZ on prostate carcinogenesis using a transgenic rat for an adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model. Adenocarcinoma lesions as a percentage of overall lesions in the ventral prostate were significantly reduced by PGZ treatment in a dose-dependent manner. The number of adenocarcinomas per given area in the ventral prostate was also significantly reduced by PGZ treatment. The Ki67 labeling index in the ventral prostate was also significantly reduced by PGZ. Decreased cyclin D1 expression in addition to the inactivation of both p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor (NF)κB were detected in PGZ-treated TRAP rat groups. In LNCaP, a human androgen-dependent prostate cancer cell line, PGZ also inhibited cyclin D1 expression and the activation of both p38 MAPK and NFκB. The suppression of cultured cell growth was mainly regulated by the NFκB pathway as detected using specific inhibitors in both LNCaP and PC3, a human androgen-independent prostate cancer cell line.

Understanding cancer-specific Notch regulation would improve specificity of targeting this pathway. In this study, we find that Notch1 activation in GSCs specifically induces expression of the lncRNA, TUG1. TUG1 coordinately promotes self-renewal by sponging miR-145 in the cytoplasm and recruiting polycomb to repress differentiation genes by locus-specific methylation of histone H3K27 via YY1-binding activity in the nucleus. Furthermore, intravenous treatment with antisense oligonucleotides targeting TUG1 coupled with a drug delivery system induces GSC differentiation and efficiently represses GSC growth in vivo. Our results highlight the importance of the Notch-lncRNA axis in regulating self-renewal of glioma cells and provide a strong rationale for targeting TUG1 as a specific and potent therapeutic approach to eliminate the GSC population. ? 2016 The Author(s).",,"antisense oligonucleotide; brain derived neurotrophic factor; CD15 antigen; gamma secretase; histone H3; microRNA 145; Myc protein; n (6,7 dihydro 6 oxo 5h dibenz[b,d]azepin 7 yl) 2,2 dimethyl n' (2,2,3,3,3 pentafluoropropyl)propanediamide; nestin; Notch receptor; transcription factor Sox2; transcription factor YY1; TUG1 protein; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; EZH2 protein, human; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; microRNA; MIRN145 microRNA, human; Myc protein; Notch1 receptor; polycomb repressive complex 2; protein binding; transcription factor EZH2; transcription factor Sox; transcription factor YY1; TUG1 long noncoding RNA, human; cancer; cells and cell components; cytoplasm; disease treatment; gene expression; methylation; nervous system disorder; protein; RNA; tumor; animal experiment; animal model; antisense therapy; Article; cell nucleus; controlled study; cytoplasm; drug delivery system; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; glioma; glioma stem cell; histone methylation; human; human cell; mouse; nerve cell differentiation; nonhuman; protein expression; stem cell self-renewal; animal; brain tumor; cancer stem cell; carcinogenesis; cell differentiation; drug screening; exon; gene expression regulation; genetics; glioma; metabolism; nerve cell; nonobese diabetic mouse; pathology; SCID mouse; Animals; Brain Neoplasms; Carcinogenesis; Cell Differentiation; Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 Protein; Exons; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Glioma; Humans; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; MicroRNAs; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Neurons; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Protein Binding; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-myc; Receptor, Notch1; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; SOXB1 Transcription Factors; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays; YY1 Transcription Factor",2-s2.0-85002706738

Recent studies have shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with tooth loss or soft diet in young animal model, and that BDNF expression is decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, single or combined effect of tooth loss and/or soft diet on brain function has not fully understood. Here we examined the effect of molar loss and powder diet on memory ability and the expression of BDNF mRNA in the hippocampus of adult C57BL/6J mice. Twenty eight-weeks-old C57BL/6J mice were divided into intact molar group and extracted molar group. They were randomly divided into the I/S group (Intact upper molar teeth/Solid diet feeding), the E/S group (Extracted upper molar teeth/Solid diet feeding), the I/P group (Intact upper molar teeth/Powder diet feeding), and the E/P group (Extracted upper molar teeth/Powder diet feeding). The observation periods were 4 and 16-week. To analyze the memory ability, the step-through passive avoidance test was conducted. BDNF-related mRNA in the hippocampus was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Results: At 4 weeks later, we performed memory test and isolated brains to analyze. There were no differences in memory function and BDNF mRNA level between these four groups. However, at 16 weeks later, E/S and E/P group showed memory impairment, and decreased level of BDNF mRNA. Whereas, the powder diet had no effect on memory function and BDNF mRNA level even at 16 weeks later. Conclusions: These results suggest that the effect of molar loss and powder diet on memory function and BDNF mRNA levels were different, molar loss may have a greater long-term effect on memory ability than powder diet does. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Brain-derived neurotrophic factor; Memory deficit; Molar loss; Powder diet,"brain derived neurotrophic factor; messenger RNA; brain derived neurotrophic factor; brain derived neurotrophic factor receptor; messenger RNA; adult; amnesia; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; feeding; gene expression; hippocampus; human; male; memory disorder; memory test; molar tooth; mouse; nonhuman; passive avoidance test; periodontal disease; powder; real time polymerase chain reaction; tooth extraction; adverse effects; animal; avoidance behavior; C57BL mouse; complication; diet; disease model; genetics; hippocampus; hypothalamus; memory; Memory Disorders; metabolism; molar tooth; pathology; periodontal disease; physiology; psychology; randomization; time factor; Animals; Avoidance Learning; Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; Diet; Disease Models, Animal; Hippocampus; Hypothalamus; Male; Memory; Memory Disorders; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molar; Random Allocation; Receptor, trkB; RNA, Messenger; Time Factors; Tooth Loss",2-s2.0-85000472414

Clinically, urologists have relied on 24-h urine collections for the last 30–40 years to help direct medical therapy in hopes of reducing stone recurrence; yet little progress has been made in preventing stone disease. As such, there is an urgent need to develop reliable animal models to study the pathogenesis of stone formation and to assess novel interventions. A variety of vertebrate and invertebrate models have been used to help understand stone pathogenesis. Genetic knockout and exogenous induction models are described. Surrogates for an endpoint of stone formation have been urinary crystals on histologic examination and/or urinalyses. Other models are able to actually develop true stones. It is through these animal models that real breakthroughs in the management of urinary stone disease will become a reality. ? 2016",Animal model; Drosophila; Genetic knockout; Mouse; Nephrocalcinosis; Porcine; Rat; Stone induction; Urinary stone disease; Urolithiasis,"calcium oxalate; cystine transporter; ethylene glycol; glycolic acid; hydroxyproline; oxalate transporter; oxalic acid; phosphate transporter; sodium phosphate cotransporter; unclassified drug; zinc; cystinuria; diet; Diptera; gastric bypass surgery; genetic model; genomics; histopathology; human; hypercalciuria; hyperoxaluria; intestine resection; mouse model; nonhuman; porcine model; priority journal; rat model; Review; stone formation; urinalysis; urolithiasis; xanthinuria; animal; disease model; pathology; Urinary Calculi; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Urinary Calculi",2-s2.0-85007454098

Although several cohort-based studies have been conducted on the composition of urinary lipidome, the data on urinary lipids cross-classified by sex, age, and body mass index (BMI) are insufficient to screen for various abnormalities. To promote the development of urinary lipid metabolomebased diagnostic assay, we analyzed 60 urine samples from healthy white adults (young (c.a., 30 years) and old (c.a., 60 years) men/women) using LC/MS. Women had a higher urinary concentration of omega-3 12-lipoxygenase (LOX)-generated oxylipins with anti-inflammatory activity compared to men. In addition, young women showed increased abundance of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and cytochrome P450 (P450)-produced oxylipins with anti-hypertensive activity compared with young men, whereas elderly women exhibited higher concentration of 5-LOX-generated anti-inflammatory oxylipins than elderly men. There were no significant differences in urinary oxylipin levels between young and old subjects or between subjects with low and high BMI. Our findings suggest that sex, but neither ages nor BMI could be a confounding factor for measuring the composition of urinary lipid metabolites in the healthy population. The information showed contribute to the development of reliable biomarker findings from urine. ? 2016 Okemoto et al.

A phase I study of lenalidomide demonstrated preliminary antitumor activity in patients with relapsed ATL. The current phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide monotherapy in patients with relapsed or recurrent ATL. Patients and Methods: Patients 20 years of age or older with acute, lymphoma, or unfavorable chronic subtype ATL, who had received one or more prior anti-ATL systemic chemotherapy and achieved stable disease or better on their last anti-ATL therapy with subsequent relapse or recurrence, were eligible. Patients received oral lenalidomide 25 mg/d continuously until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The primary end point was overall response rate; secondary end points included safety, tumor control rate (stable disease or better), time to response, duration of response, time to progression, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Results: Objective responses were noted in 11 of 26 patients (overall response rate, 42%; 95% CI, 23% to 63%), including four complete responses and one unconfirmed complete response. The tumor control rate was 73%. The median time to response and duration of response were 1.9 months and not estimable, respectively, and the median time to progression was 3.8 months. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 3.8 and 20.3 months, respectively. The most frequent grade ? 3 adverse events were neutropenia (65%), leukopenia (38%), lymphopenia (38%), and thrombocytopenia (23%), which were all manageable and reversible. Conclusion: Lenalidomide demonstrated clinically meaningful antitumor activity and an acceptable toxicity profile in patients with relapsed or recurrent aggressive ATL, hinting at its potential to become a treatment option.

The mechanism of HCV-related lymphoproliferative disorders is not fully understood. Recent studies have found that HCV in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from chronically infected patients is mainly associated with cluster of differentiation 19-positive (CD19+) B cells. To further elucidate this preferential association of HCV with B cells, we used in vitro cultured virus and uninfected peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy blood donors to investigate the necessary serum components that activate the binding of HCV to B cells. First, we found that the active serum components were present not only in HCV carriers but also in HCV recovered patients and HCV-negative, healthy blood donors and that the serum components were heat-labile. Second, the preferential binding activity of HCV to B cells could be blocked by anti-complement C3 antibodies. In experiments with complement-depleted serum and purified complement proteins, we demonstrated that complement proteins C1, C2, and C3 were required to activate such binding activity. Complement protein C4 was partially involved in this process. Third, using antibodies against cell surface markers, we showed that the binding complex mainly involved CD21 (complement receptor 2), CD19, CD20, and CD81; CD35 (complement receptor 1) was involved but had lower binding activity. Fourth, both anti-CD21 and anti-CD35 antibodies could block the binding of patient-derived HCV to B cells. Fifth, complement also mediated HCV binding to Raji cells, a cultured B-cell line derived from Burkitt's lymphoma. Conclusion: In chronic HCV infection, the preferential association of HCV with B cells is mediated by the complement system, mainly through complement receptor 2 (CD21), in conjunction with the CD19 and CD81 complex.

Materials and methods We first examined FPGS protein expressions according to FPGS SNPs genotype groups in 15 lung adenocarcinoma cell lines. Next, 101 non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with PEM and platinum drugs were classified into FPGS SNP genotype groups to investigate the relation between FPGS SNP genotypes and treatment outcome. Results When the 15 adenocarcinoma cell lines were classified into FPGS SNP 2572C?>?T genotype groups, we found that the FPGS protein expression was significantly higher in the CC genotype group than in the TT?+?CT genotype group (p?=?0.0022). In contrast, there was no significant difference in FPGS expression when another FPGS SNP was analyzed. We also examined the FPGS SNP 2572C?>?T genotype in 101 non-squamous NSCLC patients treated with PEM and platinum drugs. Among these 101 patients, response rate was significantly higher in the CC genotype group than in the TT?+?CT genotype group (p?=?0.0034). When we examined the patients treated with PEM, platinum drugs and Bev, almost all (29/33) were classified into the TT?+?CT genotype group. The response rate, progression-free survival, and over-all survival were all significantly better in the patients of the TT?+?CT genotype group who also received Bev than in those who did not receive Bev (p?=?0.034, 0.021, 0.018, respectively).

Therefore, our primary objective was to compare the anesthetic management between these 2 groups. Our secondary objective was to determine the incidence of adverse outcomes associated with RALP, which requires an extreme Trendelenburg position. Design A retrospective observational study. Setting University teaching hospital. Patients A total of 223 men, consisting of 97 LRP patients and 126 RALP patients, treated during a 3-year period (January 2010-December 2012) were retrospectively studied. Interventions None. Measurements Information on patient demographics, type of anesthesia, anesthetic/pneumoperitoneum/surgical times, intraoperative fluids and blood products, estimated blood loss, intraoperative and postoperative opioid use, postoperative analgesic consumption, length of stay in the postanesthesia care unit, postoperative complications, and hospital stays was collected and compared. Main results The estimated blood loss was higher in LRP patients than in RALP patients (median, 550 mL vs 200 mL; P < .001). Likewise, 24% of the LRP patients received intraoperative transfusions compared with 0.79% of the RALP patients (P < .001). The RALP patients had a longer anesthesia time (median, 276 vs 259 minutes; P = .032) and a greater intraoperative use of opioids (P < .001). The incidence of complications was similar in both groups with the exception of postoperative nausea and vomiting, which were observed more frequently among the RALP patients than among the LRP patients (33% vs 16%; P = .007). Conclusions This is the first report to compare the anesthetic management of RALP vs LRP. Anesthesiologists can expect RALP surgery to be associated with less blood loss and a need for fewer blood products than traditional LRP surgery. The anesthetic outcome of RALP was generally satisfactory except for a high incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Laparoscopy; Postoperative complications; Postoperative nausea and vomiting; Prostatectomy; Robotic surgical procedures,"anesthetic agent; fentanyl; opiate; propofol; remifentanil; rocuronium; volatile agent; anesthetic agent; adult; adverse outcome; aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; comparative study; controlled study; human; incidence; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; medical record review; observational study; operative blood loss; peroperative care; postoperative complication; postoperative delirium; postoperative infection; postoperative nausea and vomiting; priority journal; prostatectomy; respiratory tract disease; retrospective study; robot assisted surgery; blood transfusion; devices; general anesthesia; head-down tilt; laparoscopy; length of stay; middle aged; operation duration; operative blood loss; postoperative nausea and vomiting; procedures; prostate tumor; prostatectomy; robotic surgical procedure; treatment outcome; Aged; Anesthesia, General; Anesthetics; Blood Loss, Surgical; Blood Transfusion; Head-Down Tilt; Humans; Incidence; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84991515541

JS is genetically highly heterogeneous, with at least 29 disease genes being involved. To further understand the genetic causes of JS, we performed whole-exome sequencing in 24 newly recruited JS families. Together with six previously reported families, we identified causative mutations in 25 out of 30 (24 + 6) families (83.3%). We identified eight mutated genes in 27 (21 + 6) Japanese families, TMEM67 (7/27, 25.9%) and CEP290 (6/27, 22.2%) were the most commonly mutated. Interestingly, 9 of 12 CEP290 disease alleles were c.6012-12T>A (75.0%), an allele that has not been reported in non-Japanese populations. Therefore c.6012-12T>A is a common allele in the Japanese population. Importantly, one Japanese and one Omani families carried compound biallelic mutations in two distinct genes (TMEM67/RPGRIP1L and TMEM138/BBS1, respectively). BBS1 is the causative gene in Bardet–Biedl syndrome. These concomitant mutations led to severe and/or complex clinical features in the patients, suggesting combined effects of different mutant genes. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Previous sequencing studies of AMD susceptibility genes have revealed the association of rare coding variants in CFH, CFI, C3 and C9 in European population; however, the impact of rare or low-frequency coding variants on AMD susceptibility in other populations is largely unknown. To identify the role of low-frequency coding variants on exudative AMD susceptibility in a Japanese population, we analysed the association of coding variants of 34 AMD candidate genes in the two-stage design by a multiplex PCR-based target sequencing method. We used a total of 2,886 (1st: 827, 2nd: 2,059) exudative AMD cases including typical AMD, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, and retinal angiomatous proliferation and 9,337 (1st: 3,247 2nd: 6,090) controls. Gene-based analysis found a significant association of low-frequency variants (minor allele frequency (MAF)&lt; 0.05) in CETP, C2 and CFB. The association of CETP remained after conditioned with all known genome-wide association study (GWAS) associated variants. In addition, when we included only disruptive variants, enrichment of rare variants (MAF &lt; 0.01) was also observed after conditioned with all GWAS associated variants (P=1.03×10-6, odds ratio (OR)=2.48). Haplotype and conditional analysis of the C2-CFB-SKIV2L locus showed a low-frequency variant (R74H) in CFB would be individually associated with AMD susceptibility independent of the GWAS associated SNP. These findings highlight the importance of target sequencing to reveal the impact of rare or low-frequency coding variants on disease susceptibility in different ethnic populations. ?

Recently, we found that a decreased OCT6 expression is associated with a reduced intracellular uptake of cisplatin (CDDP), and concomitant resistance to CDDP. In the present study, we examined whether OCTs directly confer resistance to another platinum drug, oxaliplatin (L-OHP). To address this, we used parental lung cancer cell lines, PC-14 and SBC3; L-OHP-resistant sublines, PC-14/L-OHP and SBC3/L-OHP; and one CDDP-resistant subline PC-14/CDDP, to examine the relationships between the expression of OCTs and intracellular platinum drug concentration or platinum drug resistance. The two L-OHP-resistant sublines showed cross resistance to CDDP and L-OHP, and a decreased expression of OCT6. The intracellular accumulation of L-OHP in PC-14/L-OHP cells was reduced compared with the parental cells. The findings suggested that a reduced OCT6 expression confers platinum drug resistance in the sublines by decreasing the uptake of platinum drugs. Using the PC-14/CDDP cell line engineered to overexpress OCT6, we confirmed that the intracellular L-OHP concentration was increased concomitantly with OCT6 overexpression compared with the parental cell line. Additionally, OCT6 was expressed in a screening panel of lung and colon cancer tissues and matched normal control tissues. Taken together with the previous results, the present findings indicate that OCT6 is directly involved in platinum drug resistance by mediating platinum drug uptake in cancer cells. ?

Since senescence was originally reported to be induced by various genotoxic stressors, such as telomere erosion and oncogenic signaling, it has been proposed to play a pivotal role in aging-related changes and as an antitumorigenic barrier in vivo. However, the mechanisms underlying its induction and maintenance remain entirely elusive. We have recently found that abrupt activation of p53 at G2 results in a cell skipping mitosis and subsequently undergoing senescence. Surprisingly, we have also found that downregulation of p53 by SCFF bxo22 is crucial for the induction of a senescence-associated phenotype. In this review, we provide an overview of recent advances in understanding the mechanisms underlying the timing and magnitude of activation of p53 during senescence. ? 2016 The Authors.

Recent advances have led to identification of several causative gene products of dystroglycanopathy and characterization of their in vitro enzymatic activities. However, the in vivo functional roles remain equivocal for enzymes such as ISPD, FKTN, FKRP, and TMEM5 that are supposed to be involved in post-phosphoryl modifications linking the GalNAc-β3-GlcNAc-β4-Man-6-phosphate core and the outer laminin-binding glycans. Herein, by direct nano-LC-MS2/MS3 analysis of tryptic glycopeptides derived from a truncated recombinant αDG expressed in the wild-type and a panel of mutated cells deficient in one of these enzymes, we sought to define the full extent of variable modifications on this phosphorylated core O-glycan at the functional Thr317/Thr319 sites. We showed that the most abundant glycoforms carried a phosphorylated core at each of the two sites, with and without a single ribitol phosphate (RboP) extending from terminal HexNAc. At much lower signal intensity, a novel substituent tentatively assigned as glycerol phosphate (GroP) was additionally detected. As expected, tandem RboP extended with a GlcA-Xyl unit was only identified in wild type, whereas knocking out of either ISPD or FKTN prevented formation of RboP. In the absence of FKRP, glycoforms with single but not tandem RboP accumulated, consistent with the suggested role of this enzyme in transferring the second RboP. Intriguingly, the single GroP modification also required functional FKTN whereas absence of TMEM5 significantly hindered only the addition of RboP. Our findings thus revealed additional levels of complexity associated with the core structures, suggesting functional interplay among these enzymes through their interactions. The simplified analytical workflow developed here should facilitate rapid mapping across a wider range of cell types to gain better insights into its physiological relevance. ? 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"alpha dystroglycan; glycan; glycerophosphate; glycopeptide; phosphate; ribitol; dystroglycan; FKRP protein, human; FKTN protein, human; ISPD protein, human; membrane protein; nucleotidyltransferase; protein; TMEM5 protein, human; Article; controlled study; dystroglycanopathy; enzyme activity; gene mapping; human; human cell; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; muscular dystrophy; priority journal; protein modification; chemistry; gene inactivation; genetic predisposition; genetics; HCT 116 cell line; HEK293 cell line; phosphorylation; Walker Warburg syndrome; Dystroglycans; Gene Knockout Techniques; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; HCT116 Cells; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Nucleotidyltransferases; Phosphorylation; Proteins; Walker-Warburg Syndrome",2-s2.0-84995377287

However, many patients with cough variant asthma (CVA) demonstrate an FeNO in the normal range. Therefore, additional information is needed to confirm the diagnosis of CVA, particularly in patients with low FeNO levels. We aimed to investigate the feasibility of using cough triggers to help diagnose CVA. Methods We studied 163 patients presenting with prolonged/chronic cough alone (including 104 CVA patients) who underwent FeNO measurements and an airway responsiveness test, and answered a questionnaire listing 18 cough triggers. The sensitivity and specificity of FeNO levels and cough triggers for the diagnosis of CVA were determined. Results CVA patients showed higher FeNO levels than non-CVA patients. When the cut-off value of FeNO levels for the diagnosis of CVA was set at 22?ppb, its sensitivity was 57%. CVA patients more frequently responded to “cold air” and “talking” as cough triggers than non-CVA patients. When the analysis was confined to those with a low FeNO (<22?ppb) group, the sensitivity and positive predictive values of “cold air” and “talking” for the diagnosis of CVA were 36% and 70% for “cold air”, and 44% and 74% for “talking”, respectively. Their specificity was 81%. “Cold air” was associated with airway hyperresponsiveness in all patients with an emphasis on those with low FeNO levels. Conclusion “Cold air” and/or “talking” as cough triggers could be signs for the diagnosis of CVA, particularly when FeNO levels are low. ? 2016 The Japanese Respiratory Society",Chronic cough; Cold air; Cough variant asthma; Fractional nitric oxide; Talking,adult; airway dynamics; Article; asthma; chronic disease; cold air; controlled study; cough trigger; cough variant asthma; coughing; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease exacerbation; feasibility study; female; fractional exhaled nitric oxide; human; major clinical study; male; predictive value; questionnaire; reference value; respiratory tract allergy; respiratory tract examination; respiratory tract parameters; sensitivity and specificity; speech; aged; asthma; cold; exhalation; middle aged; air; biological marker; nitric oxide; Adult; Aged; Air; Asthma; Biomarkers; Cold Temperature; Cough; Exhalation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nitric Oxide; Predictive Value of Tests; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-84994106743

Herein, we evaluated the antitumor effect of a new aminosugar-conjugated, mono-functional platinum complex (Pt-Oqn), which forms a single covalent bond with DNA.

We also compared Pt-Oqn and cisplatin for DNA double-strand breaks based on phosphorylated histone H2AX levels in cancer cells and antitumor effects in xenograft models. Results: The resistance factor (RF) for Pt-Oqn was low among the four drugs, indicating the potential of Pt-Oqn for overcoming CDDP-induced resistance. In MKN45-R cells, γ-H2AX protein increased following treatment with Pt-Oqn, but not with cisplatin. Finally, Pt-Oqn, but not cisplatin, showed significant antitumor effects in MKN45-R xenografts.

The purpose of this article was to determine whether imaging features on contrast-enhanced CT can differentiate benign from metastatic adrenal masses in patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). MATERIALS AND METHODS. Between January 2008 and January 2014, 135 patients with untreated RCC were found to have 163 adrenal masses (102 benign and 61 metastatic) on contrast-enhanced CT including the corticomedullary phase (66 benign and 42 metastatic) or nephrographic phase (56 benign and 33 metastatic) or both. Imaging features of renal and adrenal masses were recorded, including T and N staging components of renal masses, internal texture, CT attenuation values, and attenuation differences between renal and adrenal masses. Logistic regression diagnostic models to differentiate benign from metastatic adrenal mass were constructed using independently signifcant imaging parameters in the respective corticomedullary and nephrographic phases (corticomedullary phase model and nephrographic phase model). Diagnostic performance of the models was evaluated by ROC analysis. RESULTS. Statistically signifcant variables for the models were regional lymphadenopathy, perirenal or renal sinus fat invasion (corticomedullary phase model only), adrenal mass size, CT attenuation value of adrenal mass, and absolute value of attenuation difference between renal and adrenal masses. Both models had excellent diagnostic performance; the AUC and optimal sensitivity and specifcity for the diagnosis of metastasis were 0.991, 100%, and 92.4%, respectively, in the corticomedullary phase model and 0.947, 81.8%, and 96.4%, respectively, in the nephrographic phase model. CONCLUSION. Differentiation between benign and metastatic adrenal masses in patients with RCC can be achieved accurately by combining multiple imaging features on contrast-enhanced CT. ? 2016 American Roentgen Ray Society.",Adrenal; CT; Diagnosis; Metastasis; Renal cell carcinoma,"contrast medium; adrenal tumor; adult; aged; Article; cancer staging; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; image analysis; image processing; kidney carcinoma; lymphadenopathy; major clinical study; male; metastasis potential; performance; priority journal; radiodensitometry; radiological parameters; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; tumor differentiation; tumor volume; very elderly; adrenal tumor; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; kidney carcinoma; kidney tumor; middle aged; pathology; procedures; secondary; x-ray computed tomography; Adrenal Gland Neoplasms; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Contrast Media; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84992655523

We assessed tissue Doppler-derived parameters [E/e′, E/(e′?× s′)] and left ventricular and right ventricular longitudinal strains in HFrEF (n?= 340) and HFpEF (n?= 102). Left ventricular and right ventricular longitudinal strains were significantly higher and E/(e′?× s′) was lower in patients with HFpEF compared with those with HFrEF, whereas E/e′ was similar between the groups. During a median follow-up of 342?days, MACE developed in 95 patients with HFrEF and 29 with HFpEF. The univariable analysis revealed similar echocardiographic predictors between the 2 groups, including E/e′, E/(e′?× s′) and pulmonary artery systolic pressure. No 2-dimensional speckle tracking–derived parameter remained significant in multivariable models in each HF group. E/(e′?× s′) was an only independent predictor with an incremental prognostic value over the Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure score and was superior to the E/e′ ratio in both HFrEF and HFpEF. In conclusion, despite differences in echocardiography-based cardiac function parameters between HFrEF and HFpEF, these HF phenotypes shared the same echocardiographic predictors of future MACE. E/(e′?× s′) was an only independent predictor for future cardiac events in both HF populations. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"aged; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular parameters; clinical outcome; disease association; disease exacerbation; female; follow up; heart failure; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; heart index; heart infarction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart stroke volume; human; lung artery pressure; major clinical study; male; mitral valve regurgitation; priority journal; prognosis; real time ultrasound scanner; systolic blood pressure; tissue Doppler imaging; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; Doppler echocardiography; heart failure; multicenter study; pathophysiology; physiology; predictive value; prospective study; Aged; Echocardiography, Doppler; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Stroke Volume",2-s2.0-84992482166

Purpose To evaluate the associations between CT findings of thymomas and their classification according to the Masaoka staging system and World Health Organization (WHO) classification. Material and Methods Eighty-four patients with thymoma were evaluated. Comparisons between the CT findings of Masaoka stage I/II and III/IV lesions, and the WHO type A-B1 (low risk) and B2/B3 (high risk) lesions were performed. Results Stage III/IV thymomas (mean size, 60 mm) were significantly larger than stage I/II (45 mm) lesions and had more irregular shape and contour. Necrosis and calcification were observed in 16 (59%) and nine (33%) stage III/IV thymomas, and 16 (28%) and seven (12%) stage I/II lesions, respectively. Regarding the WHO classification, the high-risk thymomas displayed irregular shape and contour more often than low-risk lesions. There were significant differences between the patterns of mediastinal invasion seen in high- and low-risk groups; 21 (68%) vs. six (12%) lesions demonstrated mediastinal fat invasion, seven (23%) vs. two (4%) lesions exhibited great vessel invasion, five (16%) vs. 0 (0%) lesions displayed pericardial invasion, and 18 (58%) vs. 10 (20%) lesions invaded the lungs, respectively. Conclusion Masaoka stage III/IV thymomas were larger in size, had more irregular shape and contour, and exhibited necrosis and calcification more often than the stage I/II lesions. In the WHO classification, high-risk thymomas demonstrated more irregular shape and contour than low-risk thymomas. ?

A nationwide multicenter survey of children with chronic HBV infection was performed. Among 548 patients, 15 patients developed HCC at the median age of 15?years (range 9–36), including 13 males and 2 females. A case–control comparison showed that HBeAg seroconversion and liver cirrhosis were associated with the occurrence of HCC. Of the 15 HCC patients, 5 were treated with interferon and none of them responded to interferon therapy as compared with 12 of the 17 responders in the control group. Of the 15 patients, 10 died and 9 of the 10 who died never visited any medical facilities until diagnosis of HCC, while the remaining 5 surviving patients never stopped their clinic visits. The usefulness of AFP assessment was shown by the findings that AFP levels were elevated in all HCC cases, that elevations in AFP levels were detected prior to the diagnosis in the surviving patients, and that sensitivity of AFP as a diagnostic test for HCC was very high among 40 patients including our 14 and an additional 26 collected from the literature. HBeAg seroconversion and liver cirrhosis are associated with the occurrence of HCC. Regular measurement of AFP might be helpful to watch for the occurrence of HCC when following children and young patients with chronic HBV infection since childhood. ? 2016 The Authors.

Ghrelin is secreted from the stomach in response to CR and regulates energy metabolism. We hypothesized that in CR ghrelin has a role in protecting aging-related diseases. We examined the physiological mechanisms underlying the ghrelin system during the aging process in three mouse strains with different genetic and biochemical backgrounds as animal models of accelerated or normal human aging. The elevated plasma ghrelin concentration was observed in both klotho-deficient and senescence-accelerated mouse prone/8 (SAMP8) mice. Ghrelin treatment failed to stimulate appetite and prolong survival in klotho-deficient mice, suggesting the existence of ghrelin resistance in the process of aging. However, ghrelin antagonist hastened death and ghrelin signaling potentiators rikkunshito and atractylodin ameliorated several age-related diseases with decreased microglial activation in the brain and prolonged survival in klotho-deficient, SAMP8 and aged ICR mice. In vitro experiments, the elevated sirtuin1 (SIRT1) activity and protein expression through the cAMP-CREB pathway was observed after ghrelin and ghrelin potentiator treatment in ghrelin receptor 1a-expressing cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells. Furthermore, rikkunshito increased hypothalamic SIRT1 activity and SIRT1 protein expression of the heart in the all three mouse models of aging. Pericarditis, myocardial calcification and atrophy of myocardial and muscle fiber were improved by treatment with rikkunshito. Ghrelin signaling may represent one of the mechanisms activated by CR, and potentiating ghrelin signaling may be useful to extend health and lifespan. ? 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Amphiregulin (AREG), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, has been shown to be a downstream target of CRTC1-MAML2 fusion, and to play a role in tumor growth and survival in CRTC1-MAML2–positive MEC cell lines. The aim of this study was to characterize the AREG and EGFR expression in the fusion-positive and fusion-negative MEC of the major salivary gland. The AREG and EGFR expression were studied by immunochemistry in 33 MEC cases of the major salivary glands. CRTC1-MAML2 fusion was tested by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (23 CRTC1-MAML2 fusion-positive, 10 fusion-negative). Of 23 fusion-positive cases, AREG and EGFR overexpression were detected in 17 (73.9%) and 14 (60.9%) cases, respectively. Of 10 fusion-negative cases, AREG and EGFR overexpression were detected in 1 (10%) and 3 (30.0%) cases, respectively. There was a positive correlation between CRTC1-MAML2 fusion and AREG overexpression (P < .01), but not between CRTC1-MAML2 fusion and EGFR overexpression. The AREG overexpression was associated with a longer disease-free survival of the MEC patients (P = .042), but EGFR overexpression was not. In this study, we showed that AREG overexpression was detected more frequently in the CRTC1-MAML2 fusion-positive tumors than in fusion-negative tumors. Detection of AREG expression may be useful for identifying CRTC1-MAML2–positive MECs and as a marker for favorable prognosis. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",AREG; CRTC1-MAML2; EGFR; Mucoepidermoid carcinoma; Prognosis,"amphiregulin; epidermal growth factor receptor; amphiregulin; AREG protein, human; CRTC1 protein, human; DNA binding protein; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; MAML2 protein, human; nuclear protein; transcription factor; tumor marker; adenosquamous carcinoma; adult; Article; cancer survival; clinical article; disease free survival; female; gene fusion; gene overexpression; human; human tissue; immunochemistry; immunohistochemistry; male; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; salivary gland carcinoma; aged; biopsy; Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid; genetics; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; predictive value; Salivary Gland Neoplasms; time factor; treatment outcome; tumor cell line; Aged; Amphiregulin; Biomarkers, Tumor; Biopsy; Carcinoma, Mucoepidermoid; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease-Free Survival; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Gene Fusion; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Nuclear Proteins; Predictive Value of Tests; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Salivary Gland Neoplasms; Time Factors; Transcription Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84982182015

The primary endpoints were tolerability and safety. Carfilzomib was administrated for 30?min on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 of a 28-day cycle. In cycle 1, doses for days 1 and 2 were 20?mg/m2, followed by 45 or 56?mg/m2. Three and four subjects were enrolled in the 20/45?mg/m2 cohort and 20/56?mg/m2 cohort. No dose-limiting toxicity was observed, and the tolerability of carfilzomib was confirmed. Pyrexia, hypertension, nausea and vomiting were considered as noteworthy adverse events (AE) when carfilzomib was administered at high doses. Moreover, pyrexia, blood creatinine increased, and body weight gain were observed as acute dose effects. These findings suggest that addition of dexamethasone is important to alleviate acute dose effect. The overall response rates of the 20/45?mg/m2 and 20/56?mg/m2 cohort were 66.7?% (two out of three) and 50?% (two out of four), respectively.

However, specimens obtained using EUS-guided FNA (EUS-FNA) are not recommended for histopathologic diagnosis because of inadequate sample size volume. We evaluated EUS-FNA efficacy for AIP diagnosis using a 22G needle. Methods Seventy-eight patients exhibiting the imaging characteristics indicative of AIP in the pancreatic parenchyma and pancreatic duct underwent EUS-FNA with a 22G needle at 12 institutions between February 2013 and March 2014. Samples were evaluated for tissue sampling conditions, CD38- and IgG4-positive plasma cell counts, storiform fibrosis (SF), and obliterative phlebitis (OP). Results Tissue specimens containing >10, 5 to 10, and 1 to 4 high-power fields (HPFs) were obtained from 29?(37.2%), 18 (23.1%), and 15 (19.2%) of 78 patients, respectively. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) CD38- and IgG4-positive plasma cell counts were 23.2 ± 18.8/HPF and 5.1 ± 6.7/HPF, respectively. SF was detected in 49 of 78 patients (62.8%) and OP in 38 of 78 patients (48.7%). According to the International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria (ICDC), histopathologic levels corresponded to level 1 in 32, level 2 in 13, and unclassifiable in 17 patients. Hence, 45 of 78 patients (57.7%) could be diagnosed with lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis according to ICDC. Conclusions Pancreatic tissues with at least 1 HPF were obtained by EUS-FNA from approximately 80% of patients, and nearly 60% of patients were diagnosed with ICDC level 2 or higher. Our findings indicate that EUS-FNA with a 22G needle may be useful for the histopathologic diagnosis of AIP.

We aimed to clarify a suitable reintervention method for stent occlusions following bilateral SEMS placement for MHBO. Methods: Between 2002 and 2014, 52 consecutive patients with MHBO who underwent endoscopic reintervention for stent occlusion after bilateral SEMS placement were enrolled at two university hospitals and one tertiary care referral center. We retrospectively evaluated the technical and functional success rates of the reinterventions, and the time to RBO of the revisionary stents. Results: Technical and functional success rates of the reinterventions were 92% (48/52) and 90% (43/48), respectively. Univariate analysis did not determine any significant predictive factors for technical and functional failures. Median time to RBO of the revisionary stents was 68?days. Median time to RBO was significantly longer for revisionary SEMS placement than for plastic stent placement (131?days vs 47?days, respectively; log–rank test, P?=?0.005). Revisionary SEMS placement was the only independent factor that was significantly associated with a longer time to RBO of the revisionary stent in the multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis (hazard ratio 0.37; 95% confidence interval 0.14–0.95; P?=?0.039). Conclusion: Revisionary SEMS placement is a suitable endoscopic reintervention method for stent occlusion following bilateral SEMS placement from the perspective of time to RBO of the revisionary stent. ? 2016 Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society",malignant hilar biliary obstruction; recurrent biliary obstruction; reintervention; revisionary stent; self-expandable metallic stent,adult; aged; Article; biliary tract hemorrhage; biliary tract surgery; cholecystitis; cholestasis; controlled study; digestive endoscope; endoscopic surgery; female; human; in-stent restenosis; liver abscess; major clinical study; male; malignant hilar biliary obstruction; pancreatitis; recurrent biliary obstruction; recurrent disease; retrospective study; self expandable metallic stent; bile duct tumor; cholestasis; palliative therapy; stent; Bile Duct Neoplasms; Cholestasis; Humans; Palliative Care; Retrospective Studies; Self Expandable Metallic Stents; Stents,2-s2.0-84963968559

HER2 somatic mutations have been reported, and these may influence the effect of HER2-targeted drugs. Methods: Here, we sought HER2 mutations in a group of 135 Japanese breast cancer patients with HER2-positive tumors. We analyzed HER2 mutations by direct Sanger sequencing of two major areas, the extracellular domain at position 309–310 and the kinase domain between 755 and 781. Results: Two patients with the HER2 somatic mutation S310F in the extracellular domain were found in this series. One patient with the S310F mutation had a node-negative invasive ductal carcinoma classified as HER2 2+ by the HercepTest and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) positive, and which was estrogen receptor (ER)-negative and progesterone receptor (PgR)-negative. Another patient with the S310F mutation had an apocrine carcinoma with seven lymph nodes positive for metastasis, classified as HER2 3+ by the HercepTest, but which was FISH-negative, as well as ER-negative and PgR-negative. Both patients had received adjuvant single-agent trastuzumab therapy, and had no local recurrence or distant metastasis for five and three years after surgery, respectively. Conclusions: Our data show that HER2 mutations are rare in HER2-positive Japanese breast cancer patients. The two mutations found in this study were identical, S310F. We suggest that in vitro experiments to determine whether the S310F mutation could be involved in resistance to anti-HER2 drugs are worthwhile in future. ? 2015, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.",Breast cancer; DNA sequencing; HER2; Japanese; Mutation,"epidermal growth factor receptor 2; trastuzumab; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer chemotherapy; cancer resistance; controlled study; epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene amplification; gene expression; gene sequence; HER2 gene; human; human tissue; in vitro study; Japanese (people); lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; priority journal; somatic mutation; antagonists and inhibitors; Asian continental ancestry group; Breast Neoplasms; female; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; mutation; pathology; treatment outcome; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Mutation; Receptor, ErbB-2; Trastuzumab; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84949500938

Methods: A total of 223 patients (108 premenopausal and 115 postmenopausal) with early distant recurrence and 149 patients (62 premenopausal and 87 postmenopausal) with late distant recurrence of ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer who were given their initial treatment between 2000 and 2004 were registered from nine institutions. For each late recurrence patient, approximately two matched control patients without relapse for more than 10?years were selected. Clinicopathological factors and adjuvant therapies were compared among the three groups by menopausal status and age. Results: Factors predicting early recurrence in premenopausal women were large tumor size, high lymph node category and high tumor grade, whereas predictors for late recurrence were large tumor size and high lymph node category.

Few studies have used computed tomography (CT) scanning to assess the association between sputum eosinophil differential counts and airway involvement. We aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics and airway involvement of EA, and to examine the correlation between induced sputum eosinophil differential counts and CT-assessed airway remodeling. Methods: We retrospectively divided 63 patients with stable asthma receiving inhaled corticosteroids into 2 groups: 26 patients with EA (sputum eosinophil >3%) and 37 patients with non-eosinophilic asthma (NEA). Clinical measurements such as spirometry, fractional exhaled nitric oxide levels (FeNO), and CT-assessed indices of airway involvement were compared between the groups. Multivariate analysis was performed to identify determinants of the percentage of wall area (WA%). Results: The EA group had significantly longer asthma duration, lower pulmonary function, and higher FeNO than the NEA group. Also, the EA group had higher WA% and smaller airway luminal area than the NEA group. Sputum eosinophil differential counts and WA% were positively correlated. The multivariate linear regression analysis showed that the factors associated with WA% included sputum eosinophil differential counts, age, and body mass index. However, asthma duration was not associated with WA%. Our CT-assessed findings demonstrated large airway involvement in EA, and we observed a positive association between induced sputum eosinophil differential counts and WA%. Conclusions: The findings indicate that induced sputum eosinophil differential counts may be associated with airway remodeling in patients with stable asthma. ? 2016 Taylor & Francis.",Airway wall remodeling; asthma; computed tomography; eosinophil; induced sputum,"corticosteroid; nitric oxide; salbutamol; adult; airway remodeling; Article; asthma; body mass; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; disease duration; eosinophil; eosinophilia; female; human; leukocyte differential count; lung function; major clinical study; male; retrospective study; spirometry; sputum analysis; thorax radiography; asthma; diagnostic imaging; eosinophil; immunology; leukocyte count; Loeffler pneumonia; lung; lung function test; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; physiology; sputum; statistical model; x-ray computed tomography; Asthma; Eosinophils; Female; Humans; Leukocyte Count; Linear Models; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pulmonary Eosinophilia; Respiratory Function Tests; Sputum; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84976330900

However, the mechanism of functional switching of TGF-β is still unknown, and it is unclear whether inhibition of TGF-β signaling results amelioration or exacerbation of cancers. Here we show that the tumor suppressor p53 cooperates with Smad proteins, which are TGF-β signal transducers, to selectively activate plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) transcription. p53 forms a complex with Smad2/3 in the PAI-1 promoter to recruit histone acetyltransferase CREB-binding protein (CBP) and enhance histone H3 acetylation, resulting in transcriptional activation of the PAI-1 gene. Importantly, p53 is required for TGF-β-induced cytostasis and PAI-1 is involved in the cytostatic activity of TGF-β in several cell lines. Our results suggest that p53 enhances TGF-β-induced cytostatic effects by activating PAI-1 transcription, and the functional switching of TGF-β is partially caused by p53 mutation or p53 inactivation during cancer progression. It is expected that these findings will contribute to optimization of TGF-β-targeting therapies for cancer. ?

AT-motif binding factor 1 (ATBF1) is a tumor suppressive transcription factor that is normally localized to the nucleus but has been detected in the cytoplasm in several cancers. Here, we examined the diagnostic value of the intracellular localization of ATBF1 as a marker for the identification of high risk urothelial bladder carcinoma. Methods: Seven anti-ATBF1 antibodies were generated to cover the entire ATBF1 sequence. Four human influenza hemagglutinin-derived amino acid sequence-tagged expression vectors with truncated ATBF1 cDNA were constructed to map the functional domains of nuclear localization signals (NLSs) with the consensus sequence KR[X10-12]K. A total of 117 samples from initial TUR of human bladder carcinomas were analyzed. None of the patients had received chemotherapy or radiotherapy before pathological evaluation. Results: ATBF1 nuclear localization was regulated synergistically by three NLSs on ATBF1. The cytoplasmic fragments of ATBF1 lacked NLSs. Patients were divided into two groups according to positive nuclear staining of ATBF1, and significant differences in overall survival (P = 0.021) and intravesical recurrence-free survival (P = 0.013) were detected between ATBF1+ (n = 110) and ATBF1- (n = 7) cases. Multivariate analysis revealed that ATBF1 staining was an independent prognostic factor for intravesical recurrence-free survival after adjusting for cellular grading and pathological staging (P = 0.008). Conclusions: Cleavage of ATBF1 leads to the cytoplasmic localization of ATBF1 fragments and downregulates nuclear ATBF1. Alterations in the subcellular localization of ATBF1 due to fragmentation of the protein are related to the malignant character of urothelial carcinoma. Pathological evaluation using anti-ATBF1 antibodies enabled the identification of highly malignant cases that had been overlooked at initial TUR. Nuclear localization of ATBF1 indicates better prognosis of urothelial carcinoma. ? 2016 The Author(s).",ATBF1; Nuclear localization signals; Prognostic marker; Urothelial bladder carcinoma,"AT motif binding factor 1; transcription factor; unclassified drug; homeodomain protein; tumor marker; ZFHX3 protein, human; adult; aged; Article; bladder cancer cell line; bladder carcinoma; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cell nucleus; cellular distribution; consensus sequence; controlled study; cytoplasm; diagnostic value; female; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; nuclear localization signal; overall survival; protein expression; recurrence free survival; transitional cell carcinoma; transurethral resection; animal; bladder tumor; Chlorocebus aethiops; CV-1 cell line; disease course; HEK293 cell line; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathology; transitional cell carcinoma; tumor cell line; very elderly; Western blotting; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Biomarkers, Tumor; Blotting, Western; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Nucleus; Cercopithecus aethiops; COS Cells; Cytoplasm; Disease Progression; Female; HEK293 Cells; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84992163063

In mammals, dysfunction of SIRTs is associated with age-related metabolic diseases and cancers, so SIRT modulators are considered attractive therapeutic targets. However, current screening methodologies are problematic, and no tools for imaging endogenous SIRT activity in living cells have been available until now. In this work we present a series of simple and highly sensitive new SIRT activity probes. Fluorescence of these probes is activated by SIRT-mediated hydrolytic release of a 4-(4-dimethylaminophenylazo)benzoyl (Dabcyl)-based FRET quencher moiety from the ?-amino group of lysine in a nonapeptide derived from histone H3K9 and bearing a C-terminal fluorophore. The probe SFP3 detected activities of SIRT1, -2, -3, and -6, which exhibit deacylase activities towards long-chain fatty acyl groups. We then truncated the molecular structure of SFP3 in order to improve both its stability to peptidases and its membrane permeability, and developed probe KST-F, which showed specificity for SIRT1 over SIRT2 and SIRT3. We show that KST-F can visualize endogenous SIRT1 activity in living cells. ? 2016 The Authors. Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, in yeast, the effect of eIF2 phosphorylation can be mimicked by eIF5 overexpression, which turns eIF5 into translational inhibitor, thereby promoting translation of GCN4, the yeast ATF4 equivalent. Furthermore, regulatory protein termed eIF5-mimic protein (5MP) can bind eIF2 and inhibit general translation. Here, we show that 5MP1 overexpression in human cells leads to strong formation of 5MP1:eIF2 complex, nearly comparable to that of eIF5:eIF2 complex produced by eIF5 overexpression. Overexpression of eIF5, 5MP1 and 5MP2, the second human paralog, promotes ATF4 expression in certain types of human cells including fibrosarcoma. 5MP overexpression also induces ATF4 expression in Drosophila. The knockdown of 5MP1 in fibrosarcoma attenuates ATF4 expression and its tumor formation on nude mice. Since 5MP2 is overproduced in salivary mucoepidermoid carcinoma, we propose that overexpression of eIF5 and 5MP induces translation of ATF4 and potentially other genes with uORFs in their mRNA leaders through delayed re-initiation, thereby enhancing the survival of normal and cancer cells under stress conditions. ?

Data from animal experiments suggest that atherosclerosis involves an inflammatory process of the vascular wall under hyperlipidemia. Atherothrombosis can become a serious complication of atherosclerosis leading to acute cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke. Clinical applications to use this knowledge remain scarce. The plasma levels of vascular endothelium-enriched microRNA (miRNAs) in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease could serve as a disease marker. In our laboratory vascular endothelium-enriched miRNA (miR-126) level was analyzed using quantitative RT polymerase chain reaction analysis (qRT-PCR) in plasma from patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) according to the chest symptom or findings of electrocardiogram, or middle-aged male smokers. Endothelial function for peripheral small vessels was assessed using End-PAT 2000 and expressed as reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) index. In patients with suspected CAD miR-126 was not significantly changed in CAD patients. However, miR-126 was decreased in CAD patients who also have high levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Interestingly, miR-126 was increased when LDL cholesterol was high in patients who did not have evident CAD on coronary angiography even though they have risk factors for CAD. In smokers serum cotinine levels were inversely correlated with endothelial function expressed as RH-PAT index and positively correlated with levels of metabolic parameters such as non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and insulin resistance. More than half of the smokers could not completely attain smoking cessation and, thus, the RH-PAT index was not improved 8 weeks after the instruction of smoking cessation. However, changes in the RH-PAT index showed a significant correlation with those in systolic blood pressure. In smokers who completely attained smoking cessation, both RH-PAT index and plasma miR-126 values were increased. Thus, among patients with suspected CAD or subjects with coronary risk factors plasma levels of endothelium-enriched circulating miR-126 could be substantially altered. The results suggest a potential usefulness of miR-126 as a sensitive biomarker in assessing endothelial damage. Measurement of microRNA may serve as a useful tool for laboratory assays to determine high-risk patients for atherothromobotic vascular diseases. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Coronary artery disease; Endothelium; LDL cholesterol; Plasma microRNA; Smoking,blood clotting factor 8; cotinine; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; microRNA; microRNA 126; microRNA 376c; unclassified drug; atherosclerosis; coronary angiography; coronary artery disease; disease marker; dyslipidemia; electrocardiography; endothelial dysfunction; human; hyperemia; hyperlipidemia; insulin resistance; medical research; peripheral arterial tonometry; quantitative analysis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Review; risk factor; signal transduction; smoking; smoking cessation; standardization; thrombocyte; thrombocyte aggregation; thrombosis; vascular disease,2-s2.0-84990051089

To identify genetic variants associated with IFN-induced depression, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 224 Japanese chronic hepatitis C patients receiving IFN-based therapy in a multicenter prospective study and stratified them into two groups according to the Beck Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II) score. In the GWAS stage, we selected 42 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to perform replication analysis in an independent set of 160 subjects. The SNP rs1863918 in strong linkage disequilibrium with SNPs located around the Zinc finger 354C (ZNF354C) gene on chromosome 5 showed a significant association when the results of GWAS and replication were combined (odds ratio = 2.55, P = 7.89×10-8 in the allele frequency model), suggesting that the rs1863918 T allele was associated with IFN-induced depression. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis showed that rs1863918 T allele, a history of depression, and younger age were independent predictive factors for IFN-induced depression. Interestingly, western blotting and immunofluorescence showed that ZNF354C was highly expressed in the hippocampus in mice, a region implicated in the pathology of psychiatric symptoms. In conclusion, we identified rs1863918 as significantly associated with IFN-induced depression, and revealed that the candidate gene ZNF354C is highly expressed in the hippocampus of mice. Our data might be useful for elucidating the pathogenic mechanisms of depression induced by drugs including IFN. ? 2016 Matsunami et al.

We sought to determine if heart rate variability (HRV), a marker of impaired autonomic function, differed across periods of wake, rest, and sleep as a function of the level of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A sample of young adults (N = 209), 95 of whom met full criteria for current PTSD based on the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS; Blake et?al., 1995), were evaluated for ? 24 hr using actigraphy and electrocardiogram. Actigraphy data were categorized as active, rest, or sleep. Multilevel modeling analyses showed that individuals with high PTSD symptom severity had lower high-frequency HRV than individuals with low PTSD symptom severity during periods of sleep, t(1083) = 2.20, p =.028, Cohen's d = 0.12. No differences were found during periods of activity, t(1083) = 1.34, p =.499, d = 0.05, or rest, t(1083) = 1.34, p =.180, d = 0.09. Our findings extended the import of prior studies to suggest that those with elevated PTSD symptoms may have decreased parasympathetic control during sleep. Moreover, relative to periods of wake and rest, sleep may represent a state of increased vulnerability for decreased parasympathetic cardiac control. Individuals with elevated PTSD symptoms may benefit from early screening for detection of cardiovascular disease.

Objective: The aim was to find a new curative to treat neuropathic pain without using adjuvant analgesics. Design: This was a retrospective study that used the FACES Pain Scale (FPS) to measure pain intensity and pain relief. Setting/Subjects: Twenty-eight inpatients who were treated with other strong opioids and who consulted the palliative care team about their pain relief. Results: In 22 (78.6%) out of 28 patients who successfully switched to methadone from other strong opioids, such as oxycodone and fentanyl, within two weeks, the mean FPS score was significantly reduced from 4.43 to 1.86, and methadone switching either reduced the number of prescriptions or stopped them entirely in 12 out of 17 (70.5%) patients who had used adjuvant analgesics before switching to methadone. Conclusions: These results suggest that opioid switching to oral methadone not only achieves pain relief but also curtails substantial adjuvant analgesic use.

The aimof this studywas to apply human iPS cell-derived enterocytes in pharmacokinetic studies by investigating the characteristics of drug transport into enterocyte-like cells. Human iPS cells cultured on feeder cells were differentiated into endodermal cells using activin A. These endodermal-like cells were then differentiated into intestinal stem cells by fibroblast growth factor 2. Finally, epidermal growth factor and small-molecule compounds induced the maturation of the intestinal stem cell-like cells. After differentiation, we performed transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements, immunofluorescence staining, and transport studies. TEER values increased in a time-dependentmanner and reached approximately 100Ω × cm2. Efflux transport of Hoechst 33342, a substrate of breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), was observed and inhibited by the BCRP inhibitor Ko143. The uptake of peptide transporter 1 substrate glycylsarcosine was also confirmed and suppressed when the temperature was lowered to 4°C. Using immunofluorescence staining, villin and Na+-K+ ATPase were expressed. These results suggest that human iPS cell-derived enterocytes had loose tight junctions, polarity, as well as uptake and efflux transport functions. In addition, the rank order of apparent membrane permeability coefficient (Papp) values of these test compounds across the enterocyte-like cell membrane corresponded to the fraction absorbance (Fa) values. Therefore, differentiated enterocytes from human iPS cells may provide a useful comprehensive evaluation model of drug transport and metabolism in the small intestine.

Methods: The clinical features of 1061 patients with acute liver failure (ALF) or late-onset hepatic failure (LOHF) were retrospectively examined, focusing on those who experienced HBV reactivation. Additionally, 420 patients with prHBV infection were prospectively enrolled: 203 received immunosuppressive therapies immediately after enrollment, while the remaining 217 were enrolled after having received immunosuppressive therapies without the occurrence of HBV reactivation. The serum HBV-DNA levels were prospectively monitored every month, and the incidences of HBV reactivation, defined as a serum HBV-DNA level of 1.3 log IU/ml or more, were evaluated. Results: In the retrospective study, persistent HBV infection was found in 90 patients, and HBV reactivation was responsible for liver injuries in 50 patients including 23 receiving immunosuppressive therapies (26 with HBs-antigen positivity, 7 with prHBV infection). None of seven patients with prHBV infection were rescued. In the prospective studies, HBV reactivation occurred in ten patients, but preemptive entecavir administration prevented liver injury. The cumulative reactivation rate was 3.2?% at 6?months, and the increase of the rate compared to that at 6?months was +1.5?% at 48?months. Conclusions: HBV reactivation during immunosuppression was responsible for liver injuries in a quarter of the ALF/LOHF patients with persistent HBV infection. Early serum HBV-DNA monitoring may improve patient prognosis, since HBV reactivation typically occurs within 6?months of the start of immunosuppressive therapies in patients with prHBV infection. ? 2016, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Acute liver failure; De novo hepatitis B; HBV reactivation; Immunosuppressive therapy,"adalimumab; alkylating agent; azathioprine; calcineurin inhibitor; cyclophosphamide; daunorubicin; docetaxel; entecavir; epirubicin; everolimus; fluorouracil; folinic acid; hepatitis B core antibody; hepatitis B surface antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; immunosuppressive agent; infliximab; irinotecan; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; oxaliplatin; panitumumab; prednisolone; rituximab; sorafenib; tacrolimus; temozolomide; unindexed drug; vincristine; virus DNA; antineoplastic agent; hepatitis B surface antigen; immunosuppressive agent; acute liver failure; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; child; clinical feature; female; hepatitis B; human; immunosuppressive treatment; liver failure; major clinical study; male; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; retrospective study; side effect; very elderly; virus reactivation; adverse effects; blood; chronic hepatitis B; complication; Hepatitis B virus; immunology; infant; Japan; middle aged; physiology; preschool child; virology; virus activation; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; DNA, Viral; Female; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Immunosuppression; Immunosuppressive Agents; Infant; Japan; Liver Failure, Acute; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Virus Activation; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84988864309

We recently found that the interaction between heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1) and BARD1 is required for the accumulation of BRCA1 and CtIP at sites of DNA double-strand breaks. Here, we investigated the importance of HP1 and BARD1–HP1 interaction in the localization of FANCJ together with the other BRCA1–BRCT binding proteins to clarify the separate role of the HP1-mediated pathway from the RNF8/RNF168-induced ubiquitin-mediated pathway for BRCA1 function. FANCJ interacts with HP1γ in a BARD1-dependent manner, and this interaction was enhanced by ionizing radiation or irinotecan hydrochloride treatment. Simultaneous depletion of all three HP1 isoforms with shRNAs disrupts the accumulation of FANCJ and CtIP, but not RAP80, at double-strand break sites. Replacement of endogenous BARD1 with a mutant BARD1 that is incapable of binding to HP1 also disrupts the accumulation of FANCJ and CtIP, but not RAP80. In contrast, RNF168 depletion disrupts the accumulation of only RAP80, but not FANCJ or CtIP. Consequently, the accumulation of conjugated ubiquitin was only inhibited by RNF168 depletion, whereas the accumulation of RAD51 and sister chromatid exchange were only inhibited by HP1 depletion or disruption of the BARD1–HP1 interaction. Taken together, the results suggest that the BRCA1–FANCJ and BRCA1–CtIP complexes are not downstream of the RNF8/RNF168/ubiquitin pathway, but are instead regulated by the HP1 pathway that precedes homologous recombination DNA repair. ? 2016 The Authors.

Because of the high mutability due to strand slippage during DNA synthesis, rapid evolutionary change in the number of repeating units directly shapes the range of repeat-number variation according to selection pressure. However, the remaining questions include: Why are STRs causing repeat expansion diseases maintained in the human population; and why are these limited to neurodegenerative diseases? By evaluating the genome-wide selection pressure on STRs using the database we constructed, we identified two different patterns of relationship in repeat-number polymorphisms between DNA and amino-acid sequences, although both patterns are evolutionary consequences of avoiding the formation of harmful long STRs. First, a mixture of degenerate codons is represented in poly-proline (poly-P) repeats. Second, long poly-glutamine (poly-Q) repeats are favored at the protein level; however, at the DNA level, STRs encoding long poly-Qs are frequently divided by synonymous SNPs. Furthermore, significant enrichments of apoptosis and neurodevelopment were biological processes found specifically in genes encoding poly-Qs with repeat polymorphism. This suggests the existence of a specific molecular function for polymorphic and/or long poly-Q stretches. Given that the poly-Qs causing expansion diseases were longer than other poly-Qs, even in healthy subjects, our results indicate that the evolutionary benefits of long and/or polymorphic poly-Q stretches outweigh the risks of long CAG repeats predisposing to pathological hyper-expansions. Molecular pathways in neurodevelopment requiring long and polymorphic poly-Q stretches may provide a clue to understanding why poly-Q expansion diseases are limited to neurodegenerative diseases. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Database for human polymorphism (VarySysDB); Human evolution; Single amino-acid repeat; STR polymorphism; Triplet-repeat expansion disease,"amino acid; DNA; polyglutamine; polypeptide; polyproline; unclassified drug; microsatellite DNA; amino acid sequence; apoptosis; Article; biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism; codon; genetic selection; genome-wide association study; human; human genome; nerve cell differentiation; priority journal; short tandem repeat; single nucleotide polymorphism; diseases; DNA sequence; genetic selection; genetics; molecular evolution; nervous system development; sequence analysis; Disease; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Human; Humans; Microsatellite Repeats; Neurogenesis; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Analysis, Protein",2-s2.0-84983416217

This study was designed to reveal the role of RhoA signaling in the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain in mice. Partial sciatic nerve injury caused thermal hyperalgesia, mechanical allodynia, and increased plasma membrane translocation of RhoA in the lumber spinal cord. GFAP-immunoreactivity (ir), Iba-1-ir, and Rho kinase 2 (ROCK2-ir) was also increased in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn of nerve-ligated mice. Moreover, partial nerve ligation increased the expression of phosphorylated myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS)-ir in the ipsilateral spinal dorsal horn. Daily intrathecal administration of simvastatin, beginning 3?days before nerve injury, completely blocked all these changes in nerve-ligated mice. Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK also attenuated the increased expression of GFAP-ir and phosphorylated MARCKS-ir. Together, it is suggested that astrogliosis initiated by the activation of RhoA/ROCK signaling results in MARCKS phosphorylation in nerve terminals, which leads to hyperalgesia in neuropathic pain. Furthermore, simvastatin exerts antihyperalgesic and antiallodynic effects through the inhibition of spinal RhoA activation. ? 2016",astrocyte; myristoylated alanine-rich protein kinase C substrate (MARCKS); neuropathic pain; Rho kinase (ROCK); RhoA; simvastatin,"allograft inflammatory factor 1; MARCKS protein; protein serine threonine kinase; Rho kinase; Rho kinase 2; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; simvastatin; unclassified drug; actin binding protein; Aif1 protein, mouse; analgesic agent; calcium binding protein; glial fibrillary acidic protein; glial fibrillary astrocytic protein, mouse; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; membrane protein; myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate; protein kinase inhibitor; Rho guanine nucleotide binding protein; Rho kinase; RhoA protein, mouse; Rock2 protein, mouse; signal peptide; simvastatin; allodynia; analgesic activity; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; astrocytosis; cell activation; controlled study; drug mechanism; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; hyperalgesia; immunoreactivity; male; molecular pathology; mouse; neuropathic pain; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein transport; signal transduction; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; astrocyte; disease model; drug effects; gliosis; injuries; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; lumbar vertebra; metabolism; microglia; neuralgia; pathology; sciatic nerve; spinal cord; Analgesics; Animals; Astrocytes; Calcium-Binding Proteins; Disease Models, Animal; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Gliosis; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hyperalgesia; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice, Inbred ICR; Microfilament Proteins; Microglia; Neuralgia; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; rho GTP-Binding Proteins; rho-Associated Kinases; Sciatic Nerve; Simvastatin; Spinal Cord",2-s2.0-84979895345

However, treatment responses vary widely among individuals. Despite a lack of data, free serum IgE levels following omalizumab treatment have been proposed as a marker of treatment responsiveness. Methods: In this prospective, observational study, we assessed the utility of biomarkers of type 2 inflammation in predicting omalizumab treatment responses, as determined by the absence of asthma exacerbation during the first year of treatment. Free serum IgE levels were monitored for 2 years to examine their association with baseline biomarker levels and the number of exacerbations. Results: We enrolled thirty patients who had been treated with omalizumab for at least 1 year, of whom 27 were treated for 2 years. Baseline serum periostin levels and blood eosinophil counts were significantly higher in patients without exacerbations during the first year of treatment than in patients with exacerbations. Baseline serum periostin levels, but not eosinophil counts, were negatively associated with free serum IgE levels after 16 or 32 weeks of treatment. Reduced free serum IgE levels during treatment from those at baseline were associated with reduced exacerbation numbers at 2 years. In 14 patients who continued to have exacerbations during the first year of treatment, exacerbation numbers gradually and significantly decreased over the 2-year study period, with concurrent significant reductions in free serum IgE levels. Conclusion: Baseline serum periostin levels and serum free IgE levels during treatment follow-up may be useful in evaluating responses to omalizumab treatment. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Several EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are currently approved, and both gefitinib and erlotinib are the most well-known first-generation EGFR-TKIs. This randomized phase III study was conducted to investigate the difference between these two EGFR-TKIs. Patients and Methods: Previously treated patients with lung adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to receive gefitinib or erlotinib. This study aimed to investigate the noninferiority of gefitinib compared with erlotinib. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Results: Five hundred sixty-one patients were randomly assigned, including 401 patients (71.7%) with EGFR mutation. All baseline factors (except performance status) were balanced between the arms. Median PFS and overall survival times for gefitinib and erlotinib were 6.5 and 7.5 months (hazard ratio [HR], 1.125; 95% CI, 0.940 to 1.347; P = .257) and 22.8 and 24.5 months (HR, 1.038; 95% CI, 0.833 to 1.294; P = .768), respectively. The response rates for gefitinib and erlotinib were 45.9% and 44.1%, respectively. Median PFS times in EGFR mutation-positive patients receiving gefitinibversus erlotinib were 8.3 and 10.0 months, respectively (HR, 1.093; 95% CI, 0.879 to 1.358; P = .424). The primary grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rash (2.2% for gefitinib v 18.1% for erlotinib) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation (6.1%/13.0% for gefitinib v 2.2%/3.3% for erlotinib).

C9orf72 harbors a hexanucleotide repeat, GGGGCC, in a non-coding region of the gene and a massive expansion of this repeat causes ALS, FTD, or both (FTD/ALS). Many questions lie ahead. What does this gene normally do? What is the consequence of an enormous GGGGCC repeat expansion on that gene's function? Could that hexanucleotide repeat expansion have additional pathological actions unrelated to C9orf72 function? There has been tremendous progress on all fronts in the quest to define how C9orf72 mutations cause disease. Many new experimental models have been constructed and unleashed in powerful genetic screens. Studies in mouse and human patient samples, including iPS-derived neurons, have provided unprecedented insights into pathogenic mechanisms. Three major hypotheses have emerged and are still being hotly debated in the field. These include (1) loss of function owing to decrease in the abundance of C9orf72 protein and its ability to carryout its still unknown cellular role; (2) RNA toxicity from bidirectionally transcribed sense (GGGGCC) and antisense (GGCCCC) transcripts that accumulate in RNA foci and might sequester critical RNA-binding proteins; (3) proteotoxicity from dipeptide repeat proteins produced by an unconventional form of translation from the expanded nucleotide repeats. Here we review the evidence in favor and against each of these three hypotheses. We also suggest additional experiments and considerations that we propose will help clarify which mechanism(s) are most important for driving disease and therefore most critical for considering during the development of therapeutic interventions.

The prevalence of chronic HBV infection in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals is 5%-15%; HIV/HBV coinfected individuals have a higher level of HBV replication, with higher rates of chronicity, reactivation, occult infection, and HCC than individuals with HBV only. The prevalence of HBV genotype A is significantly higher among men who have sex with men (MSM), compared with the rest of the population. Molecular mechanisms of infection, pathology, and symptomatology: HBV replication begins with entry into the hepatocyte. Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide was identified in 2012 as the entry receptor of HBV. Although chronic hepatitis B develops slowly, HIV/HBV coinfected individuals show more rapid progression to cirrhosis and HCC. Transmission and protection: The most common sources of HBV infection are body fluids. Hepatitis B (HB) vaccination is recommended for all children and adolescents, and all unvaccinated adults at risk for HBV infection (sexually active individuals such as MSM, individuals with occupational risk, and immunosuppressed individuals). Although HB vaccination can prevent clinical infections (hepatitis), it cannot prevent 100% of subclinical infections. Treatment and curability: The goal of treatment is reducing the risk of complications (cirrhosis and HCC).

The program was designed to improve these variables by refreshing and healing participants' minds and bodies. Twenty-four mothers of 26 children diagnosed with ASD in Japan were included in the study and completed measures of quality of life and parental stress before, during, and after participation in the Skippu-Mama program. Our results demonstrated that time was a significant main effect. Further, multiple comparisons with Bonferroni corrections indicated a significant increase in World Health Organization Quality of Life 26 scores three months into the program and at its conclusion six months after commencement. Overall, the Skippu-Mama program improved the quality of life of mothers of children with ASD, and we believe that the intervention's focus on both individual and family variables may be especially effective in this population. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",autism spectrum disorders; mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder; parenting stress; peer support; program to complement parental training; quality of life,adult; autism; child parent relation; clinical trial; complication; female; human; Japan; male; middle aged; mother; procedures; program development; psychology; quality of life; trends; Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Mothers; Parenting; Program Development; Quality of Life,2-s2.0-85028242993

However, it remains unclear whether this signaling pathway is activated in gastric cancer. In the present study, the aim was to investigate the role of Notch signaling in gastric cancer by investigating the subcellular localization of Notch-associated proteins in tissue samples from gastric cancer patients. Samples were obtained from 115 gastric cancer patients who had undergone surgery at the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Science without pre-operative chemotherapy or radiation. Subsequently the correlation between translocation of NOTCH1 intracellular cytoplasmic domain (NICD) into the nucleus (as measured by immunostaining) and survival in gastric cancer patients after surgery was investigated. The results were analyzed in reference to the patients' clinicopathological characteristics and the effects of these results on patient prognosis were determined. Significant correlations were observed between NICD nuclear localization and clinicopathological characteristics, such as tumor status (T factor), lymph node status (N factor), pathological stage and differentiation status. No significant correlations were observed between NICD nuclear localization and age, gender, tumor location, vein invasion or lymphatic invasion. Patients with >30% of cancer cell nuclei positively stained for NICD (as revealed by immunostaining) were associated with a significantly shorter survival following surgery than patients with <30% NICD-positive cancer cell nuclei (log-rank test, P=0.0194). Univariate analysis revealed that among the clinicopathological factors examined, T factor [risk rate (RR)=10.870; P=0.0016], N factor (RR=41.667; P=0.0003), lymphatic invasion (RR=13.158; P=0.0125), vein invasion (RR=25.000; P= 0.0019) and translocation of NICD to the nucleus (RR=3.937; P=0.0312) were all identified to be statistically significant prognostic factors. However, multivariate analysis revealed that translocation of NICD to the nucleus was not independently associated with an unfavourable prognosis in patients with gastric cancer. The present results suggest that NOTCH1 acts as an oncogene in gastric cancer. It is hypothesized that translocation of NICD into the nucleus may be used as a therapeutic target in gastric cancer. ? 2016 Spandidos Publications.

The dose distributions of 3D-CRT-, IMRT-, and SSPT-based WPRT plans were compared in 10 patients with cervical cancer. All of the patients were treated with a prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy in 1.8-Gy daily fractions, and all of the plans involved the same planning target volume (PTV) constrictions. A 3D-CRT plan involving a four-field box, an IMRT plan involving seven coplanar fields, and an SSPT plan involving four fields were created. The median PTV D95% did not differ between the 3D-CRT, IMRT and SSPT plans. The median conformity index 95% and homogeneity index of the IMRT and SSPT were better than those of the 3D-CRT. The homogeneity index of the SSPT was better than that of the IMRT. SSPT resulted in lower median V20 values for the bladder wall, small intestine, colon, bilateral femoral heads, skin, and pelvic bone than IMRT. Comparing the Dmean values, SSPT spared the small intestine, colon, bilateral femoral heads, skin and pelvic bone to a greater extent than the other modalities. SSPT can reduce the irradiated volume of the organs at risk compared with 3D-CRT and IMRT, while maintaining excellent PTV coverage. Further investigations of SSPT are warranted to assess its role in the treatment of cervical cancer. ? 2016 The Author 2016.

The study's objective was to evaluate the increased cytocidal effect by apoptotic PDT using a novel photosensitizer, glucose-conjugated chlorin, by irradiation of light-emitting diode laser (G-PDT) in comparison with conventional PDT using talaporfin sodium (T-PDT). Materials and Methods: The cytocidal effect of GPDT was compared to that of T-PDT as a control. Tumor viability was determined by an in vitro MTS assay. The percentage of apoptosis-positive cells was examined by triple stain flow cytometry (annexin V, ethidium homodimer III and Hoechst 33342) in the BDC cell line (NOZ cell) in vitro. The change in transplanted tumor volume in vivo (4-week-old male BALB/c mice) was examined 7 days after PDT. Results: Cell death was induced in a light dose-dependent manner by PDT. The laser power was set at 5 Jules/cm2 to obtain half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) in T-PDT and GPDT and the concentration of photosensitivity for G-PDT (2.02 g/ml) was lower than that for T-PDT (4.14 g/ml). Both T-PDT and G-PDT showed increased induction rates in comparison to the light only or G-chlorin only. Furthermore, the rate of apoptosis in the G-PDT (92.6%) was increased in comparison to that in the T-PDT (38.9%). The increased rates of tumor volume during the 7 days in both the G-PDT and T-PDT groups were significantly lower than that in the non-PDT group (p<0.01). At day 7, the increased rates of tumor volume in the G-PDT group were significantly lower than that in the T-PDT group (p<0.05).

In particular, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase-recruitment domain (ASC) has been reported a proapoptotic molecule that is epigenetically silenced in several human cancers. ASC is a well-characterized adaptor protein involved in the formation of multiprotein oligomers, called inflammasomes, and plays a crucial role in the activation and secretion of interleukin-1β and interleukin-18 in innate immune cells. However, the function of ASC in the regulation of tumor progression remains elusive. The present investigation examined the involvement of ASC in cancer progression and the acquisition of metastatic ability. To determine the effect of ASC depletion in in vitro and in vivo model systems, ASC was stably knocked down in B16 murine melanoma cell lines using retroviral transduction of shRNA. ASC suppression increased the motility of B16BL6 cells in scratch assays and augmented invasiveness as assessed by a Matrigel-coated transwell system. Invadopodia formation and Src phosphorylation level were markedly enhanced in ASC-knockdown cells as well. Since caspase-8 has been reported to enhance cellular migration by Tyr380 phosphorylation via Src, we examined Tyr380 phosphorylation of caspase-8 in ASC-knockdown cells and found it to be elevated in ASC-knockdown cells but attenuated by z-VAD-fmk or z-IETD-fmk. Moreover, ASC ablation increased pulmonary metastasis in mice after intravenous injection of B16BL6 cells. Our cumulative findings indicate that ASC suppresses cancer metastasis and progression via the modulation of cytoskeletal remodeling and the Src-caspase-8 signaling pathway. ? 2016 The Authors.

One gantry treatment room has a pencil beam scanning treatment delivery nozzle. The other two treatment rooms have a passive scattering treatment delivery nozzle. In the scanning treatment delivery nozzle, an energy absorber and an aperture system to treat head and neck cancer have been equipped. In the passive treatment delivery nozzle, a multi-leaf collimator is equipped. We employ respiratory gating to treat lung and liver cancers for passive irradiation. The proton therapy system passed all acceptance tests. The first patient was treated on February 25, 2013, using passive scattering fixed beams. Respiratory gating is commonly used to treat lung and liver cancers in the passive scattering system. The MLCs are our first choice to limit the irradiation field. The use of the aperture for scanning irradiation reduced the lateral fall off by half or less. The energy absorber and aperture system in scanning delivery is beneficial to treat head and neck cancer. ? 2016, Australasian College of Physical Scientists and Engineers in Medicine.",Proton therapy; Proton therapy facilities; Proton therapy physics; Proton therapy technology,"Acceptance tests; Biological organs; Diseases; Energy absorption; Irradiation; Nozzles; Proton beams; Respiratory mechanics; Scanning; Head-and-neck cancer; Irradiation fields; Multileaf collimators; Proton therapy; Proton therapy systems; Respiratory gatings; Scanning irradiation; Treatment delivery nozzles; Proton beam therapy; Article; bone cancer; cancer radiotherapy; collimator; dosimetry; head and neck cancer; health care facility; human; Japan; linear accelerator; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; pancreas cancer; prostate cancer; proton therapy; proton therapy system; soft tissue cancer; synchrotron; computer assisted diagnosis; radiation response; radiotherapy dosage; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Humans; Japan; Proton Therapy; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy Dosage",2-s2.0-84987888920

However, the influence of pneumonia on the prognosis of patients with varying types of dementia has not been fully evaluated. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the data from medical and autopsy reports. All study patients had been hospitalized and underwent brain autopsy in a hospital in Toyohashi, Japan, between 2005 and 2014. The patients with subtypes of dementia, specifically Alzheimer's disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), or vascular dementia (VaD), were neuropathologically diagnosed and examined. Pneumonia incidence, cause of death, and the clinical time-course of dementia were compared among the dementia subtypes. The time to death from dementia onset (survival time) was compared by the Kaplan–Meier method among subtypes of dementia with or without pneumonia. Risk factors for survival time on all study patients were analyzed with the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: Of the 157 eligible patients, 63 (40.1%) had AD, 42 (26.8%) had DLB, and 52 (33.1%) had VaD. Pneumonia complication was observed with high incidence in each subtype of dementia, especially in DLB (90.5%). The median total duration from dementia onset to death was 8 years in AD and DLB, and 5 years in VaD. The VaD subtype had more male patients than AD or DLB (P = 0.010), and age of death in this group was the youngest among the three groups (P = 0.018). A significant difference was observed in the survival time by the Kaplan–Meier method among the three groups (P < 0.001) and among the groups with pneumonia (P = 0.002). The factors associated with shorter survival time were male gender, pneumonia complications, diabetes mellitus, age of dementia onset ? 75 years, and VaD.

Subjects and Methods: This was a cross-sectional observational study. Palliative care team representatives in all designated cancer hospitals in Japan completed an ad hoc questionnaire. Demographic data in 2014 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare in Japan. Results: Of 422 institutions, 389 responded (92%) and data were obtained from 379 (90%). Approximately 90% of institutions had implemented a distress screening program at some level, and approximately 60% had just started screening. Among those institutions that screened, 77% provided individualized triage to specialized services within the institutions, whereas 60% did not routinely follow-up with patients who had positive screening results. The estimated median percentage of screened patients referred to palliative care teams was 0.4% in outpatient settings and 6.3% in inpatient settings. Although 68% of respondents perceived that screening was useful overall, they also reported difficulties when conducting screening with patients, reporting ""no established effective treatment for problems screened"" (66%), ""patients complain it is difficult to express their distress using scales"" (58%), and that it was ""difficult to manage screened problems because of lack of time"" (49%). Eight perceived barriers to implementing distress screening programs in hospitals were identified; a lack of human resources ranked highest. Conclusions: Implementation of distress screening in designated cancer hospitals in Japan has just begun. Policymakers should acknowledge that screening can be beneficial for patients when it is implemented with appropriate resources and established methods. ?

Treatment success was achieved by 83.3% (n = 10) of patients at week 16 (primary end-point) with CGI evaluated as “very much improved” (n = 9) and “much improved” (n = 1). Moreover, the area of erythema with pustules improved as early as week 1 and resolved by week 16 in most of the patients. The improvements were sustained throughout 52 weeks. Over the 52-week treatment period, secukinumab was well tolerated with no unexpected safety signals. Nasopharyngitis, urticaria, diabetes mellitus and arthralgia were the frequent adverse events reported. The data from this study shows that secukinumab can become one of the potent treatment options for GPP. ? 2016 Japanese Dermatological Association",clinical global impression; generalized pustular psoriasis; interleukin-17A; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; secukinumab,cyclosporin; etretinate; methotrexate; prednisolone; secukinumab; adult; arthralgia; Article; Bowen disease; cellulitis; clinical article; Clinical Global Impression scale; diabetes mellitus; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; drug dose titration; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; female; generalized pustular psoriasis; generalized pustular psoriasis; human; hypoglycemia; Japanese (people); Japanese Dermatological Association severity index score; liver dysfunction; male; monotherapy; multicenter study; open study; phase 3 clinical trial; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; pustular psoriasis; rhinopharyngitis; skin disease assessment; toxic hepatitis; upper gastrointestinal bleeding; urticaria,2-s2.0-84985920039

The relationship between alcohol intake and hypertension was examined according to the flushing response in a representative sample of the Japanese population. Participants in the National Health and Nutrition Survey in 2010 were asked to participate in the baseline survey of NIPPON DATA2010. Here, we investigated the relationship between alcohol intake and hypertension according to the flushing response. Statistical analyses were performed in a cross-sectional manner using multiple logistic regression models after adjusting for age, body mass index, smoking status, present illness of diabetes mellitus and present illness of dyslipidemia. Of the 1139 men and 1263 women, 659 and 463, respectively, had hypertension. Among the men, alcohol intake was positively associated with hypertension, regardless of the flushing response (P for linear trend both <0.05). This positive relationship was observed for both users and non-users of antihypertensive drugs. No interaction with the flushing response was observed (P for interaction=0.360). In women, although the direction differed between flushers and non-flushers, the association between alcohol intake and hypertension was not significant, regardless of flushing response.

Although high expression of PD-L1 in tumor tissues has been implicated to correlate with the better response to the anti-PD-1 therapies, this association has been controversial. In this study, to characterize immune microenvironment in tumors, we examined mRNA levels of immune-related genes and characterized T cell repertoire in the tumors of 13 melanoma patients before and after nivolumab treatment. We found that, in addition to the PD-L1 (p = 0.03), expression levels of PD-1 ligand-2 (PD-L2), granzyme A (GZMA) and human leukocyte antigen-A (HLA-A) in the pre-treatment tumors were significantly higher (p = 0.04, p = 0.01 and p = 0.006, respectively) in responders (n = 5) than in non-responders (n = 8). With nivolumab treatment, tumors in responders exhibited a substantial increase of CD8, GZMA and perforin 1 (PRF1) expression levels as well as increased ratio of TBX21/GATA3, suggesting dominancy of helper T cell type 1 (Th1) response to type 2 (Th2) response. T cell receptor β (TCR-β) repertoire analysis revealed oligoclonal expansion of tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor tissues of the responders. Our findings suggest that melanoma harboring high PD-1 ligands (PD-L1 and PD-L2), GZMA and HLA-A expression may respond preferentially to nivolumab treatment, which can enhance Th1-skewed cellular immunity with oligoclonal expansion of TILs. ? 2016 The Author(s).

The present study evaluated associations between single nucleotide polymorphisms in the core circadian gene clock circadian regulator (CLOCK) and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Japanese population. Methods: Cross-sectional data were analyzed from 2485 subjects (1243 men, 1242 women; age 35–69 years) enrolled in the baseline surveys of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study. Associations between three CLOCK gene polymorphisms (rs1801260, rs3736544, and rs4864548) and the prevalence of obesity (body mass index [BMI] ?25 kg/m2), overweight (BMI ?23 kg/m2), and T2D were evaluated by logistic regression analyses; haplotype analysis and stratified analyses for the prevalence of diabetes were also conducted. Results: Compared with those who were homozygous for the respective major alleles, subjects with the rs1801260 minor allele C had a significantly higher odds ratio (1.5; 95% confidence interval 1.1–2.1) for the prevalence of diabetes after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including BMI. When stratified by overweight, the associations between rs1801260 and the prevalence of diabetes were marked and significant in non-overweight subjects, but not in overweight subjects. The TGA (rs1801260–rs3736544–rs4864548) haplotype was associated with a lower prevalence of diabetes, whereas the CGG haplotype was associated with a higher prevalence of diabetes. Conclusions: Variant of the CLOCK gene and related haplotypes are associated with the prevalence of T2D in the Japanese population, in which obesity is less common, and the association between CLOCK gene variant at rs1801260 and the prevalence of diabetes is enhanced in normal-weight subjects. ? 2015 Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd",cross-sectional studies; single nucleotide polymorphism; type 2 diabetes mellitus,transcription factor CLOCK; adult; aged; Article; body mass; CLOCK gene; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic variability; haplotype; homozygote; human; Japan; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; single nucleotide polymorphism,2-s2.0-84983086786

In this study, we investigated the antiviral effect of FIT-039 on HBV infection. HepG2 cells expressing human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (HepG2/NTCP cells) were infected with HBV in the presence of FIT-039. FIT-039 dose-dependently reduced intracellular viral RNA, nucleocapsid-associated viral DNA, and supernatant viral antigens without cytotoxicity in the infected cells (IC50 = 0.33 μM, CC50 &gt; 50 μM). The antiviral activity of FIT-039 was prominent at an early phase of viral infection, although the compound did not inhibit preS1-binding to HepG2/NTCP cells. FIT-039 reduced cccDNA in HBV-replicating or HBV-infected cells. Furthermore, the antiviral activity of entecavir was significantly enhanced by the combination with FIT-039 in the chimeric mice having human hepatocytes infected with HBV. None of the mice had significant drug-related body weight or serum human-albumin concentration changes.

The NF-κB activity of MM cells is mediated via two distinct pathways, canonical and non-canonical, which show opposing activity after BTZ treatment in MM cells. Recent studies of proteasome inhibition in MM cells reveal that the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), referred to as ER stress, triggered the activity of several pro-apoptotic factors and sources of cell stress, such as the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which is considered to be the main mechanism of action of BTZ-induced apoptosis. Several factors associated with ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR) have been identified with the sensitivity of BTZ treatment. Low levels of XBP1, ATF3, and ATF4, which regulate UPR and ER stress-induced apoptosis, have been observed in poor responders to BTZ treatment, and three other genes, KLF9, Nampt, and CDK5, are associated with response to BTZ-containing therapy. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying BTZ-induced apoptosis in MM cells; however, further study is needed to develop potential predictive biomarkers of efficacy of BTZ-containing therapy. ? 2016, The Japanese Society of Hematology.",Bortezomib; ER stress; Mechanism of action; Multiple myeloma; NF-κB,bortezomib; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; proteasome; proteasome inhibitor; ubiquitin; proteasome inhibitor; apoptosis; bone marrow stroma cell; cancer resistance; drug mechanism; endoplasmic reticulum stress; enzyme activity; human; multiple myeloma; Review; unfolded protein response; drug effects; endoplasmic reticulum stress; multiple myeloma; pathology; Apoptosis; Bortezomib; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Humans; Multiple Myeloma; Proteasome Inhibitors; Unfolded Protein Response,2-s2.0-84966699274

Using ecological momentary assessment and minute-to-minute HRV/HR monitoring, we examined whether cross-sectional associations between PTSD symptom severity and HRV/HR were due to overall elevations in distress levels or to attenuated autonomic regulation during episodes of acute distress. Methods Two hundred nineteen young adults (18-39 years old), 99 with PTSD, underwent 1 day of Holter monitoring and concurrently reported distress levels via ecological momentary assessment. Using multilevel modeling, we examined the associations between momentary distress and the 5-minute means for low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) HRV and HR immediately following distress ratings, and whether PTSD symptom severity moderated these associations. Results Compared with the controls, participants with PTSD recorded higher ambulatory distress (mean [standard deviation] = 1.7 [0.5] versus 1.2 [0.3], p <.001) and HR (87.2 [11.8] versus 82.9 [12.6] beats/min, p =.011), and lower ambulatory LF HRV (36.9 [14.7] versus 43.7 [16.9 ms, p =.002) and HF HRV (22.6 [12.3] versus 26.4 [14.6] milliseconds, p =.043). Overall distress level was not predictive of HR or HRV (p values >.27). However, baseline PTSD symptom severity was associated with elevated HR (t(1257) = 2.76, p =.006) and attenuated LF (t(1257) = -3.86, p <.001) and HF (t(1257) = -2.62, p =.009) in response to acute momentary distress. Conclusions Results suggest that PTSD is associated with heightened arousal after situational distress and could explain prior findings associating PTSD with HR/HRV.

Recently, mutations of the CSMD3 gene were identified in schizophrenia and autism patients. However, biochemical properties and functions of the CSMD3 protein remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that CSMD3 is an oligomeric type I transmembrane protein localized in the apical dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the postnatal brain. In cultured hippocampal neurons, CSMD3 is expressed only after 7 days in vitro. Overexpression of CSMD3 induced dendritic branching in hippocampal neurons. Regulation of dendritic morphology by CSMD3 depended on the presence of its extracellular region, while CSMD3 intracellular region was dispensable for this activity. These results suggest that CSMD3 acts as a co-receptor of an unidentified membrane protein to regulate dendrite development.

We evaluated the fate of such residual masses. Of 50 patients in whom the tumor shadow persisted for &#x003E; 1 year on computed tomography, only 8 developed local recurrence. The 3-year local control rate was 81%. Thus, the persistence of lung masses does not necessarily indicate future local recurrence. Background After stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) to the lung, radiation pneumonitis and fibrotic changes often develop, and the tumor shadow usually becomes indistinguishable from the fibrotic shadow. Occasionally, however, a residual mass in patients with no or mild radiation pneumonitis will be observed on serial computed tomography (CT) scans. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the fate of such residual masses and, if possible, to determine the types of tumor at increased risk of local recurrence. Patients and Methods A total of 50 patients (underlying disease: primary lung cancer in 45, local recurrence in 2, and metastasis in 3) were selected because they had been followed up for &#x003E; 2 years or until death and had observable CT changes and measurable tumor size for &#x003E; 1 year, regardless of the influence of radiation pneumonitis. The patients' outcomes were compared according to various patient and tumor characteristics, including the presence and absence of emphysema, tumor size, and tumor shrinkage rate. The median follow-up period was 52 months. Results Of the 50 patients, only 8 developed local recurrence. The local control rate was 81% at 3 years and 73% at 5 years. The local control rates were similar between patients with a high tumor shrinkage rate and those with a low rate. The patients with emphysema exhibited a lower local control rate.

Methods: Sixty-five specimens from 65 women (median 62?years; range 34–86) obtained during breast-conserving surgery were prospectively investigated. Specimens underwent DM (25–40 kVp, 12–322 mA?s) and DBT (25–34 kVp, 13–137?mA) in two orthogonal planes, anteroposterior (AP) and latero-lateral (LL). Images were interpreted by a radiologist to detect invasive lesions and their extensive intraductal components (EIC) or ductal carcinomas in situ (DCIS); afterwards, they were compared with histopathological findings. Results: In AP views, 96?% of the invasive lesions were detected by both the methods. Of the EICs, 55 and 65?% were detected by DM and DBT, respectively (P?=?0.61). Of the DICSs, 31 and 38?% were detected by DM and DBT, respectively (P?>?0.99). In LL views, 71 and 13?% of the invasive lesions were detected by DBT and DM, respectively (P?<?0.0001). Of the EICs, 42 and 10?% were detected by DBT and DM, respectively (P?=?0.0078). Of the 13 DCISs, 42 and 8?% were detected by DBT and DM, respectively (P?=?0.32). The whole lesion and contour could be delineated in 45?% by DBT and in 6.2?% by DM (P?<?0.0001). Conclusions: DBT could detect breast cancer more accurately than DM in LL views, indicating its potential to more precisely diagnose vertical invasion. ? 2015, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.",Breast cancer; Breast-conserving surgery; Margin assessment; Specimen mammography; Tomosynthesis,"adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; breast examination; controlled study; digital breast tomosynthesis; digital mammography; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; image analysis; intermethod comparison; intraductal carcinoma; intraoperative period; major clinical study; partial mastectomy; priority journal; prospective study; tumor invasion; tumor volume; Breast Neoplasms; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; mammography; middle aged; partial mastectomy; pathology; procedures; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Intraoperative Period; Mammography; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies",2-s2.0-84937713888

Here, we found that downregulation of SGO1 caused a synergistic phenotype in cells overexpressing MYCN. Downregulation of SGO1 impaired proliferation and induced DNA damage followed by a senescence-like phenotype only in MYCN-overexpressing neuroblastoma cells. In these cells, SGO1 knockdown induced DNA damage, even during interphase, and this effect was independent of cohesin. Furthermore, MYCN-promoted SGO1 transcription and SGO1 expression tended to be higher in MYCN-or MYC-overexpressing cancers. Together, these findings indicate that SGO1 plays a role in the DNA damage response in interphase.

Patients and methods: WJOG4407G was a randomized, open-label, phase III trial conducted in Japan. Patients with previously untreated mCRC were randomized 1:1 to receive either FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab (FOLFIRI + Bev) or mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab (mFOLFOX6 + Bev), stratified by institution, adjuvant chemotherapy, and liver-limited disease. The primary end point was non-inferiority of FOLFIRI + Bev to mFOLFOX6 + Bev in progression-free survival (PFS), with an expected hazard ratio (HR) of 0.9 and non-inferiority margin of 1.25 (power 0.85, one-sided α-error 0.025). The secondary end points were response rate (RR), overall survival (OS), safety, and quality of life (QoL) during 18 months. This trial is registered to the University Hospital Medical Information Network, number UMIN000001396. Results: Among 402 patients enrolled from September 2008 to January 2012, 395 patients were eligible for efficacy analysis. The median PFS for FOLFIRI + Bev (n = 197) and mFOLFOX6 + Bev (n = 198) were 12.1 and 10.7 months, respectively [HR, 0.905; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.723-1.133; P = 0.003 for non-inferiority]. The median OS for FOLFIRI + Bev and mFOLFOX6 + Bev were 31.4 and 30.1 months, respectively (HR, 0.990; 95% CI 0.785-1.249). The best overall RRs were 64% for FOLFIRI + Bev and 62% for mFOLFOX6 + Bev. The common grade 3 or higher adverse events were leukopenia (11% in FOLFIRI + Bev/5% in mFOLFOX6 + Bev), neutropenia (46%/35%), diarrhea (9%/5%), febrile neutropenia (5%/2%), peripheral neuropathy (0%/22%), and venous thromboembolism (6%/2%). The QoL assessed by FACT-C (TOI-PFC) and FACT/GOG-Ntx was favorable for FOLFIRI + Bev during 18 months. Conclusion: FOLFIRI plus bevacizumab was non-inferior for PFS, compared with mFOLFOX6 plus bevacizumab, as the first-line systemic treatment for mCRC. Clinical trials number: UMIN000001396. ?

Age at clinical onset is significantly older in patients with IgG4-SC. Patients with IgG4-SC appear similar to those with cholangiocarcinoma and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). The association between IgG4-SC and autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) is useful for the diagnosis of IgG4-SC. However, some IgG4-SC cases are isolated from AIP and are difficult to diagnose. The authors focus on three distinct features of IgG4-SC. First, diffuse inflammation induces a longer stenosis on cholangiography in contrast to the short stenosis of patients with PSC. Second, fibroinflammatory involvement is observed mainly in the stroma of the bile duct wall, whereas the bile duct epithelium is intact. Third, steroid therapy results in remarkable improvement. Although the prognosis of patients with IgG4-SC is good, some cases have developed portal hypertension and liver cirrhosis during their clinical course. Further study is needed to elucidate the long-term outcomes and mechanism of IgG4-SC. ? 2016 by Thieme Medical Publishers, Inc.",autoimmune pancreatitis; cholangiocarcinoma; immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis; inflammatory bowel disease; pancreatic carcinoma; primary sclerosing cholangitis,"immunoglobulin G4; steroid; immunoglobulin G; Article; bile duct; bile duct biopsy; biliary tract endoscopy; cholangiography; cholestasis; clinical feature; conservative treatment; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; disease course; gastrointestinal biopsy; human; immunoglobulin blood level; immunoglobulin G4 related disease; intraductal ultrasonography; liver cirrhosis; long term care; multicenter study (topic); portal hypertension; primary sclerosing cholangitis; priority journal; prognosis; sclerosing cholangitis; steroid therapy; stroma; systematic review (topic); autoimmune disease; biopsy; blood; echography; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; female; immunology; liver; male; onset age; pancreatitis; pathology; pathophysiology; sclerosing cholangitis; Age of Onset; Autoimmune Diseases; Biopsy; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde; Cholangitis, Sclerosing; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Liver; Male; Pancreatitis; Steroids; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-84982683321

The objectives of this study were to identify predictors of postoperative deterioration of performance status and cardiopulmonary complications in cases of thoracoscopic lobectomy. Between June 2005 and October 2012, we retrospectively reviewed 188 consecutive subjects who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy for preoperative stage I nonsmall cell lung cancer. The demographic and clinical parameters, including physical function, were analysed using a multivariate logistic regression to clarify the determinants. The percent predicted diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, quadriceps muscle strength and pathologic stage were independent risk factors for deterioration of performance status after surgery in the multivariate analyses. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 6-min walking distance and pathologic stage were also independent risk factors for postoperative cardiopulmonary complications. Our data suggest that, in addition to a greater pathologic stage, lower diffusing capacity and comorbid chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, poor physical function was associated with worse short-term outcomes after thoracoscopic lobectomy. An evaluation of preoperative quadriceps muscle strength and 6-min walk test is easily performed and may therefore be a useful predictor in cases of thoracoscopic lobectomy.",,"carbon monoxide; 6 min walking distance; adult; aged; Article; cancer staging; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical feature; endoscopic surgery; female; functional assessment; heart disease; human; Karnofsky Performance Status; lung diffusion capacity; lung disease; lung lobectomy; major clinical study; male; medical record review; muscle strength; non small cell lung cancer; observational study; outcome assessment; physical activity; postoperative complication; postoperative period; priority journal; quadriceps femoris muscle; retrospective study; risk factor; thoracoscopic lobectomy; cardiovascular disease; complication; forced expiratory volume; lung; lung function test; lung resection; lung tumor; middle aged; multivariate analysis; non small cell lung cancer; preoperative period; procedures; prospective study; risk assessment; thoracoscopy; treatment outcome; vital capacity; walk test; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pneumonectomy; Preoperative Period; Prospective Studies; Pulmonary Diffusing Capacity; Respiratory Function Tests; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Thoracoscopy; Treatment Outcome; Vital Capacity; Walk Test",2-s2.0-84979987444

We hypothesized that expression of M2BP might also change in the process of atherosclerosis. Methods This study included subjects who visited our hospital for a physical checkup. Results The M2BP levels in subjects with hypertension, dyslipidemia, or abnormal glucose metabolism were higher than those in subjects without such risk factors. Moreover, the M2BP levels were associated with severity of cardiovascular risk. Subdivision of M2BP levels into quartiles revealed that M2BP was significantly associated with reactive oxygen metabolites, central systolic blood pressure, and radial augmentation index (AI). Logistic regression analysis with the endpoint of high radial AI (above mean value) showed that high radial AI was independently associated with high M2BP. Conclusions Although the spectrum was narrow as compared to that in cases of hepatic fibrosis, serum M2BP may reflect silent atherosclerosis in apparently healthy subjects. ? 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Atherosclerosis; Augmentation index; Cardiovascular risk factor; Mac-2 binding protein; Oxidative stress,"binding protein; glucose; mac 2 binding protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; membrane protein; reactive oxygen metabolite; TAA90K protein, human; tumor antigen; adult; aged; Article; atherosclerosis; augmentation index; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular risk; comparative study; controlled study; disease severity; dyslipidemia; female; glucose metabolism; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; oxidative stress; physical examination; priority journal; protein blood level; protein expression; radial artery; radial augmentation index; systolic blood pressure; analysis; atherosclerosis; blood; blood pressure; cardiovascular disease; diabetes mellitus; glomerulus filtration rate; glucose blood level; inflammation; liver; liver cirrhosis; liver tumor; metabolism; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathology; regression analysis; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; systole; Adult; Aged; Antigens, Neoplasm; Atherosclerosis; Blood Glucose; Blood Pressure; Cardiovascular Diseases; Diabetes Mellitus; Dyslipidemias; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Hypertension; Inflammation; Liver; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Membrane Glycoproteins; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Oxidative Stress; Radial Artery; Reactive Oxygen Species; Regression Analysis; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity; Systole",2-s2.0-84975811097

This study aimed to identify factors that predicted the occurrence of and recovery from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease after pancreatoduodenectomy. Methods This retrospective study included 120 patients who underwent pancreatoduodenectomy between April 2004 and December 2013. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was diagnosed using unenhanced computed tomography as a value of <40 Hounsfield units. Recovery from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was based on increases in liver computed tomographic attenuation values. Pre-, intra-, and postoperative factors were analyzed using univariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression models. Results Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease occurred after pancreatoduodenectomy in 45 patients (38%), and in 11 of 41 patients (27%) who received prophylactic pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy and in 34 of 79 patients (43%) who did not (P?=?.082). Six patients received therapeutic supplementation after diagnosis. The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease recovery rates in patients who did and did not receive pancreatic enzyme supplementation therapy were 100% and 58%, respectively (P?=?.069). Multivariable analysis identified a high body mass index, small pancreatic volume, long operative time, and a high aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio 1?month after pancreatoduodenectomy as independent risk factors. A small diameter main pancreatic duct, a low serum amylase level at postoperative day 28, and a high minimum liver computed tomographic value predicted recovery from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conclusion The non-alcoholic fatty liver disease occurrence rate in patients undergoing pancreatoduodenectomy is high, but in about half of these patients, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease will resolve without any enzyme supplementation. Prophylactic supplementation in the postoperative management of pancreatoduodenectomy patients should be based on risk factors, and therapeutic supplementation should be based on recovery factors. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,alanine aminotransferase; amylase; aspartate aminotransferase; pancreas enzyme; pancrelipase; prescription drug; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; amylase blood level; analyzer; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body mass; computer assisted tomography; convalescence; diagnostic test accuracy study; enzyme replacement; female; human; independent variable; intraoperative period; major clinical study; male; nonalcoholic fatty liver; normal value; operation duration; outcome assessment; pancreas; pancreatic duct; pancreaticoduodenectomy; postoperative period; predictive value; preoperative evaluation; prescription; priority journal; prognosis; retrospective study; risk factor; surgical patient; volume analyzer; adverse effects; complication; convalescence; middle aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Pancreatic Diseases; pancreaticoduodenectomy; pathology; Postoperative Complications; statistical model; treatment outcome; Aged; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Pancreatic Diseases; Pancreaticoduodenectomy; Postoperative Complications; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84975489307

However, ingrowth is not prevented, and reintervention is often troublesome. A novel 6-mm threaded fully covered self-expandable metal stent (T-FCSEMS) is available that may mitigate these issues. We aimed to clarify the safety and efficacy of T-FCSEMS placement for MHBO. Methods Thirty patients underwent T-FCSEMS placements for MHBOs between 2014 and 2015. T-FCSEMSs were used for initial stenting in 17 patients (initial group) and for reinterventions for USEMS occlusions caused by ingrowth in 13 patients (reintervention group). The technical success rates, times to recurrent biliary obstruction, and the reintervention success rates were evaluated. Results The technical success rates were 94% (16/17) and 92% (12/13) in the initial group and reintervention group, respectively. Intrahepatic bile duct occlusions caused liver abscesses 8 days and 22 days after T-FCSEMS placements in 2 cases (7%) in the initial group, in which T-FCSEMSs were placed across the intrahepatic bile duct bifurcation. The median times to recurrent biliary obstruction were 210 days in the initial group after bilateral placement and 112 days and 152 days in the reintervention group after bilateral and unilateral placements, respectively. During reintervention, T-FCSEMS removal was successful in all patients in whom it was attempted, and the success rate of endoscopic reintervention was 100% in both groups.

Recently, 2-ethyl-1-hexanol (2E1H) emitted from adhesives and carpeting materials has been postulated to cause “sick building syndrome.” Patients’ symptoms are associated with an increased sense of smell. This investigation aimed to characterize the histopathological changes of the olfactory epithelium (OE) of the nasal cavity and the olfactory bulb (OB) in the brain, due to subchronic exposure to 2E1H. Male ICR mice were exposed to 0, 20, 60, or 150?ppm 2E1H for 8?h every day for 1?week, or 5?days per week for 1 or 3?months. After a 1-week exposure, the OE showed inflammation and degeneration, with a significant concentration-dependent reduction in the staining of olfactory receptor neurons and in the numbers of globose basal cells at ?20?ppm. Regeneration occurred at 1?month along with an increase in the basal cells, but lymphocytic infiltration, expanded Bowman’s glands, and a decrease in the olfactory receptor neurons were observed at 3?months. Intriguingly, the OB at 3?months showed a reduction in the diameters of the glomeruli and in the number of olfactory nerves and tyrosine hydroxylase-positive neurons, but an increased number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1-positive microglia in glomeruli. Accordingly, 2E1H inhalation induced degeneration of the OE with the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level of 20?ppm. The altered number of functional cell components in the OB suggests that effects on olfactory sensation persist after subchronic exposure to 2E1H. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",2-Ethyl-1-hexanol (2E1H); Histopathological changes; Inhalation; Olfactory bulb; Olfactory epithelium,"2 ethylhexanol; adaptor protein; ionized calcium binding adapter molecule 1; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; unclassified drug; 2-ethylhexanol; air pollutant; hexanol; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; degeneration; exposure; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; indoor air pollution; inflammation; lymphocytic infiltration; male; microglia; mouse; nonhuman; olfactory bulb; olfactory epithelium; olfactory nerve; olfactory receptor neuron; priority journal; sick building syndrome; subchronic inhalation exposure; adverse effects; air pollutant; animal; body weight; dose response; drug effects; immunology; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; neutrophil chemotaxis; olfactory bulb; olfactory mucosa; organ size; pathology; time factor; toxicity; Air Pollutants; Animals; Body Weight; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Hexanols; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Mice, Inbred ICR; Neutrophil Infiltration; Olfactory Bulb; Olfactory Mucosa; Organ Size; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84964039153

The Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score (SINS) can be used to assist in standardizing evaluations of neoplastic spinal instability between spinal and non-spine surgeons. This research investigated the association between SREs and SINS for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: Between 2009 and 2013, 47 patients with NSCLC who were diagnosed with bone metastasis were classified using SINS into either a stable group (SINS, 0–6 points) or unstable group (SINS, 7–18 points). The primary endpoint was time from diagnosis of metastasis to SREs. Secondary endpoints included tumor type and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutational status. SREs were defined as spinal compression, pathologic fracture, spinal surgery, and hypercalcemia. Results: Patients included 37 cases of adenocarcinoma and 10 cases of squamous cell carcinoma. Mean follow-up time was 10.2?±?13.7?months. SRE incidence was 15.0?% (3/20) in the stable group versus 44.4?% (12/27) in the unstable group (p?=?0.048). A Cox regression model revealed that an EGFR-positive mutational status (hazard ratio [HR]?=?0.15, 95?% CI, 0.030.71; p?=?0.017) or good spinal stability (HR?=?0.49; 0.08–0.99; p?=?0.049) were favorable prognostic factors. Conclusion: The incidence of SREs was significantly lower in NSCLC patients with better spinal stability as determined by SINS, which was a good prediction tool for SREs from bone metastasis. The lower incidence of SREs in EGFR-positive patients suggests tumor biology should be considered when predicting SREs. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Bone metastasis; EGFR mutation; Non-small lung cancer; Skeletal-related event; Spinal instability neoplastic score,"bisphosphonic acid derivative; epidermal growth factor receptor; protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor; steroid; zoledronic acid; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; adult; aged; Article; bone disease; bone metastasis; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; clinical article; female; general condition deterioration; human; hypercalcemia; incidence; lung adenocarcinoma; male; mutational analysis; non small cell lung cancer; pathologic fracture; predictive value; priority journal; quality of life; scoring system; spinal cord compression; Spinal Instability Neoplastic Score; spine instability; spine surgery; squamous cell lung carcinoma; bone tumor; cohort analysis; complication; genetics; lung tumor; middle aged; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; retrospective study; secondary; Aged; Bone Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Quality of Life; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-84961114102

Twenty consecutive patients (11.2%) developed lung metastases after initial treatment of primary chondrosarcoma in the extremities. We investigated the oncological outcome of 20 chondrosarcoma patients with lung metastasis. There were 14 males and six females with a mean age of 49 years. The mean duration between primary surgery and appearance of lung metastases was 34 months. The mean follow-up period was 48 months. We excluded patients with lung metastasis at the time of presentation from this study. At the final follow-up, four of 20 patients had no evidence of disease, four were alive with disease, and twelve had died of disease. The 3- and 5-year survival rates after lung metastasis were 51.5% and 45.7%, respectively. Tumor grade, extrapulmonary metastasis, and treatment for lung metastases including metastasectomy and radiofrequency ablation were identified by univariate analysis to be significant prognostic factors for oncological analysis. In conclusion, this study evaluated the oncological outcome in patients with chondrosarcoma of the extremities with lung metastasis.

However, 90% of acutely infected adults can clear the virus, suggesting the presence of other, interferon-independent pathways leading to viral clearance. Given the known ability of helicases to bind viral nucleic acids, we performed a functional screening assay to identify helicases that regulate HBV replication. We identified the superkiller viralicidic activity 2-like (SKIV2L) RNA helicase (a homolog of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Ski2 protein) on the basis of its direct and preferential interaction with HBV X-mRNA. This interaction was essential for HBV X-mRNA degradation at the RNA exosome. The degradation of HBV X-mRNA at the RNA exosome was also mediated by HBS1L (HBS1-like translational GTPase) protein, a known component of the host RNA quality control system. We found that the redundant HBV-precore translation initiation site present at the 3′-end of HBV X-mRNA (3′ precore) is translationally active. The initiation of translation from this site without a proper stop codon was identified by the non-stop-mediated RNA decay mechanism leading to its degradation. Although 3′ precore is present in the five main HBV-RNA transcripts, only X-mRNA lacks the presence of an upstream start codons for large, middle, and small (L, M, and S) HBV surface proteins. These upstream codons are in-frame with 3′ precore translation initiation site, blocking its translation from the other HBV-mRNA transcripts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the anti-viral function of the non-stop-mediated RNA decay mechanism. ? 2016 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Antibiotics; Glycoproteins; Isomers; Proteins; Quality control; RNA; Viruses; Yeast; Adaptive immune response; Control mechanism; Functional screening; Hepatitis B virus; Mrna degradations; Preferential interaction; Surface proteins; Translation initiation site; Nucleic acids; messenger RNA; DNA helicase; exosome multienzyme ribonuclease complex; hepatitis B virus X protein; messenger RNA; SKIV2L protein, human; start codon; transactivator protein; virus RNA; 3' untranslated region; Article; controlled study; exosome; Hepatitis B virus; molecular cloning; non stop mediated RNA decay; nonhuman; priority journal; quality control; RNA analysis; RNA degradation; RNA stability; stop codon; translation initiation; biosynthesis; genetics; Hep-G2 cell line; Hepatitis B virus; human; metabolism; start codon; Codon, Initiator; DNA Helicases; Exosome Multienzyme Ribonuclease Complex; Hep G2 Cells; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; RNA, Viral; Trans-Activators",2-s2.0-84979729409

Therefore, the identification of novel target molecules for the treatment of esophageal cancer is necessary. Here, we investigated the clinicopathological significance of transcription factor 4/transcription factor 7-like 2 (TCF4/TCF7L2) in resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), because TCF4/TCF7L2 expression has not been studied in esophageal cancer previously. This study included 79 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgery between 1998 and 2005. The expression of the TCF4/TCF7L2 protein in the nucleus of esophageal cancer cells was analyzed using immunohistochemistry. We examined the correlation between TCF4/TCF7L2 expression, clinicopathological factors, and prognosis in patients with ESCC. TCF4/TCF7L2 was expressed in 57 % (45/79) of patients. TCF4/TCF7L2 expression was correlated with T factor (T1 vs. T2-4, p = 0.001), stage (I vs. II-IV, p =0.0058), Ly factor (p =0.038), and V factor (p =0.038) and did not correlate with age, gender or N factor.

Histone deacetylase (HDAC) alters the epigenetic status of tumor-associated genes, including those for miRNAs (miRNA), and affects the behavior of cancers. Here, we examined the molecular effects of a HDAC inhibitor, OBP-801, on AR expression and tumor cell growth in prostate cancers. Treatment with OBP-801 efficiently suppressed cell growth of three prostate cancer lines (22Rv1, VCaP, and LNCaP), together with AR downregulation, regardless of their hormone sensitivity. Intriguingly, this effect by OBP-801 was not due to decreased transcriptional activity of the AR gene, but due to posttranscriptional regulation, namely by miRNA-mediated suppression. Among the upregulated miRNAs after OBP-801 treatment in the three prostate cancer cell lines, miR-320a, whose expression was significantly correlated with prognosis of prostate cancers (P ? 0.0185), was the most closely associated with AR expression. An miR-320a mimic suppressed AR protein expression together with growth suppression, while anti-miR-320a oligonucleotide significantly abrogated the growth suppression by OBP-801 treatment. FISH analysis revealed that miR-320a was highly expressed in human normal prostate luminal cells, but was rarely expressed in prostate cancer cells. In an AR-dependent prostate tumorigenic rat model, OBP-801 treatment profoundly increased miR-320a expression and repressed prostate tumorigenesis. Our data demonstrated that OBP-801 effectively suppressed AR activity via epigenetic upregulation of miR-320a, which resulted in tumor cell growth suppression of prostate cancers. OBP-801 may be a potent AR-targeting therapeutic reagent in AR-positive prostate cancer regardless of androgen dependency. ? 2016 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"androgen receptor; histone deacetylase inhibitor; messenger RNA; microRNA; microRNA 320; microRNA 320a; obp 801; unclassified drug; androgen receptor; antiandrogen; AR protein, human; cyclopeptide; histone deacetylase inhibitor; microRNA; MIRN320 microRNA, human; YM753 compound; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer prognosis; clinical article; controlled study; drug dose comparison; drug megadose; fluorescence in situ hybridization; histone acetylation; human; human cell; human tissue; low drug dose; male; nonhuman; overall survival; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostate cancer cell line; protein expression; rat; rat model; receptor down regulation; transcription regulation; upregulation; animal; genetics; mortality; physiology; Prostatic Neoplasms; Sprague Dawley rat; tumor cell line; Androgen Antagonists; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; Humans; Male; MicroRNAs; Peptides, Cyclic; Prostatic Neoplasms; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Androgen",2-s2.0-84978374672

OCTA is a noninvasive, rapid, and reproducible method to assess retinal ischemia. However, one of its limitations is the size of scanning area. A novel yet simple technique to expand the scan length on optical coherence tomography has been reported as an extended field imaging (EFI) technique. It involves imaging the posterior pole through trial frames fitted with a +20 diopter lens. We applied this technique to OCTA to evaluate retinal vein occlusion. Materials and methods: Ten eyes of nine patients with retinal vein occlusion were studied. The average age was 69.0 years (range: 49-93 years). We obtained OCTA images by using RTVue XR Avanti OCT with AngioVue?. The images of OCTA with scan size of 8×8 mm were obtained with and without EFI, and then they were compared. Results: OCTA with EFI technique was performed successfully in all eyes. The nonperfusion area was well defined in superficial capillary plexus layer. The images with EFI were able to capture the larger area of the fundus by an average of 188.5% than those without EFI. The posterior pole inside the vascular arcade was well covered with this technique. The area of the fundus imaged by OCTA with EFI technique was even larger than that of fluorescein angiography using Heidelberg Retina Angiograph 2, which captured a 30° field. Conclusion: Our results suggested that OCTA with EFI technique is very useful to evaluate the retinal ischemia in retinal vein occlusion. ? 2016 Kimura et al.",EFI; Extended field imaging; Nonperfusion area; OCTA; Optical coherence tomography angiography; Retinal vein occlusion; RVO; Wide-field imaging,adult; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease duration; extended field imaging technique; eye fundus; feasibility study; female; fluorescence angiography; human; imaging; macular edema; male; optical coherence tomography; optical coherence tomography angiography; optical coherence tomography device; prospective study; retina ischemia; retina vein occlusion; very elderly; visual acuity,2-s2.0-84982676327

Here, we identified domperidone (DPD), a dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2) antagonist that enhances β cell mass. Over time, islet β cell loss occurs in dissociation cultures, and this was inhibited by DPD. DPD increased proliferation and decreased apoptosis of β cells through increasing intracellular cAMP. DPD prevented β cell dedifferentiation, which together highly contributed to the increased β cell mass. DRD2 knockdown phenocopied the effects of domperidone and increased the number of β cells. Drd2 overexpression sensitized the dopamine responsiveness of β cells and increased apoptosis. Further analysis revealed that the adenosine agonist 5′-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine, a previously identified promoter of β cell proliferation, acted with DPD to increase the number of β cells.

Sixty-six eyes with ME secondary to BRVO were enrolled in this retrospective observational case-control study. Twenty eyes received a sub-Tenon's capsule injection of triamcinolone acetonide (STTA), 22 eyes an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection (ranibizumab), 16 eyes were switched from STTA to ranibizumab, 4 eyes underwent vitrectomy, and 4 eyes were untreated. Multiple regression analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted, respectively, to identify independent predictors of visual acuity (VA) prognosis and risk factors for refractory ME longer than 1 year. The mechanism of refractory ME and therapeutic approaches for identified risk factors also were investigated. Thirty-four (52%) eyes had refractory ME for over 1 year. Microaneurysms were identified as risk factors for refractory ME, leading to poor final VA. Ranibizumab suppressed microaneurysm formation and refractory ME, with early administration more effective. For already formed microaneurysms, laser photocoagulation reduced additional treatments. Microaneurysms may cause refractory ME in BRVO.

The value of ALDH1 in predicting the time of recurrence remains unknown. Methods: In total, 184 patients with early distant recurrence, 134 patients with late distant recurrence, and 321 control patients without recurrence for more than 10 years after starting initial treatment for ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, registered in 9 institutions, were analyzed. We assessed relationships between ALDH1 and other clinicopathological features, and ALDH1 expression was compared among the three groups. The relationship between ALDH1 expression and overall survival after recurrence was also evaluated in each group. Results: The rates of ALDH1 expression positivity (more than 1 %) in the early, late, and no recurrence groups were 18.4 %, 13.4 %, and 8.4 %, respectively. ALDH1 expression correlated significantly with lymph node metastases (p = 0.048) and the Ki-67 labeling index (p < 0.001) in the early recurrence group. Multivariate analysis revealed ALDH1 expression to be significantly higher in the early recurrence group than in the no recurrence group (adjusted OR 2.140, 95 % CI 1.144-4.003, p = 0.016). Moreover, there was a significant difference in ALDH1 expression between the early and no recurrence groups receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy and chemotherapy (adjusted OR 4.625, 95 % CI 1.881-12.474, p < 0.001). However, there was no difference in ALDH1 expression between the late and no recurrence groups in univariate analysis (OR 1.507, 95 % CI 0.738-2.998, p = 0.253). In multivariate analysis, ALDH1 was not a factor independently predicting overall survival after the detection of recurrence (adjusted OR 1.451, 95 % CI 0.985-2.085, p = 0.059). Conclusions: Among patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, ALDH1 expression was more common in those with early recurrence, and this expression was found to be associated with a more aggressive breast cancer phenotype than that in the patients without recurrence. Further study is needed to clarify the prognostic significance of the heterogeneity of cancer stem cells and to confirm their role in resistance to chemotherapy. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1; Breast cancer; Estrogen receptor-positive; Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-negative; Time of recurrence,"aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1; anthracycline; aromatase inhibitor; cyclophosphamide; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; fluorouracil; gonadorelin; Ki 67 antigen; methotrexate; progesterone receptor; tamoxifen; taxane derivative; aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; isoenzyme; retinal dehydrogenase; tumor marker; adult; Article; bilateral cancer; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer grading; cancer hormone therapy; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer stem cell; cancer survival; controlled study; correlational study; disease activity; distant metastasis; drug resistance; estrogen receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative breast cancer; estrogen receptor positive human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative breast cancer; female; human; human cell; human tissue; labeling index; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; oncological parameters; overall survival; predictive value; protein expression; recurrence free survival; retrospective study; survival time; time of recurrence; tumor volume; young adult; aged; breast tumor; cancer stem cell; clinical trial; follow up; gene expression; genetics; immunohistochemistry; metabolism; metastasis; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; pathology; prognosis; time factor; tumor recurrence; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Isoenzymes; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Prognosis; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen; Retinal Dehydrogenase; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84976863739

Methods: 16 participants with T2D (age 65.4 ±1.1 years) participated in 2 separate sessions. After an overnight fast, each participant consumed a test meal and then kept resting for 180 min, except when performing each 3 min bout of ST-EX at 60 and 120 min after the meal (ST-EX session), or kept resting for 180 min (REST session). ST-EX comprised 6 continuous repetitions of climbing to the second floor (21 steps) at a rate of 80-110 steps/min followed by walking down slowly to the first floor at a free step rate. Results: The BG at 60 min after the meal during the ST-EX session (immediately before the first ST-EX) did not differ from that during the REST session, but analysis of variance revealed a significant interaction between time and treatment (p<0.01). The BG at 150 min after the meal (30 min after the second ST-EX) was significantly lower than that during the REST session (p<0.01). The area under the curve was also 18% lower during the ST-EX session than during the REST session (p<0.05). The heart rate and blood lactate levels indicated that the actual intensity of ST-EX was ‘hard’. In contrast, the rating of perceived exertion (RPE) indicated that the overall intensity of ST-EX was ‘moderate’ because of decreased RPE scores during descent. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that performing 3 min ST-EX 60 and 120 min after a meal may be a useful strategy to accelerate the decrease in postprandial BG levels in participants with T2D. ? 2016, BMJ Publishing Group.

We aimed to clarify the clinical features of AOSPD. Methods:: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features of 20 patients with AOSPD at two tertiary referral centers between 1993 and 2012. We compared 17 AOSPD patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) and 42 patients with acute-on-CP in terms of clinical characteristics, presentation, and laboratory and imaging findings. Results:: The etiology of AOSPD involved CP in 17 (85%) patients, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in 2 (10%), and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm in 1 (5%). Endoscopic pancreatic drainage was effective in 19 (95%) patients. Body temperature was significantly higher in AOSPD with CP than acute-on-CP patients (median: 38.2 vs 36.9 °C; P < 0.001). Serum amylase levels at onset were significantly lower (median: 133 vs 364.5 U/L; P = 0.009), and C-reactive protein was significantly higher (median: 9.42 vs 1.06 mg/dL; P < 0.001) in AOSPD with CP patients. Enlargement of the pancreatic parenchyma (18 vs 93%; P < 0.001) and stranding of the surrounding fat (12 vs 93%; P < 0.001) on computed tomography were observed less frequently in patients with AOSPD with CP patients. The diameter of the main pancreatic duct was significantly greater in AOSPD with CP than acute-on-CP patients (median: 7 vs 5 mm; P = 0.006). Conclusions:: The major etiology of AOSPD involved CP, and endoscopic pancreatic drainage was effective.

A recent work suggested that SGK1 activity restores damage in a stroke model. To further investigate the role of SGKs in ischemic brain injury, we examined how SGK inhibitors influence stroke outcome in?vivo and neurotoxicity in?vitro. Infarct volumes were compared in adult mice with middle cerebral artery occlusion, followed by 24?h reperfusion, in the absence or presence of SGK inhibitors. Neurotoxicity assay, electrophysiological recording, and fluorescence Ca2+ imaging were carried out using cultured cortical neurons to evaluate the underlying mechanisms. Contrary to our expectation, infarct volume by stroke decreased significantly when SGK inhibitor, gsk650394, or EMD638683, was administrated 30?min before middle cerebral artery occlusion under normal and diabetic conditions. SGK inhibitors reduced neurotoxicity mediated by N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, a leading factor responsible for cell death in stroke. SGK inhibitors also ameliorated Ca2+ increase and peak amplitude of NMDA current in cultured neurons. In addition, SGK inhibitor gsk650394 decreased phosphorylation of Nedd4-2 and inhibited voltage-gated sodium currents. These observations suggest that SGK activity exacerbates stroke damage and that SGK inhibitors may be useful candidates for therapeutic intervention. (Figure presented.) To investigate the role of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases (SGKs) in ischemic brain injury, we examined how SGK inhibitors influence stroke outcome. Infarct volumes induced by middle cerebral artery occlusion were decreased significantly by SGK inhibitors. The inhibitors also reduced glutamate toxicity, at least partly, by attenuation of NMDA and voltage-gated sodium currents. Thus, SGK inhibition attenuates stroke damage. ? 2016 International Society for Neurochemistry",glutamate; mouse; NMDA; SGK1; sodium channels; stroke,calcium ion; emd 638683; gsk 650394; phosphotransferase; phosphotransferase inhibitor; protein Nedd4 2; serum and glucocorticoid regulated kinase; ubiquitin protein ligase; unclassified drug; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; enzyme activity; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; molecular imaging; molecular pathology; mouse; neuroprotection; neurotoxicity; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; sodium current,2-s2.0-84979026537

For human cancer risk assessment, however, data after administration of MWCNT via the airway, the exposure route that is most relevant to humans, is required. The present study was undertaken to investigate the carcinogenicity of MWCNT-N (NIKKISO) after administration to the rat lung. MWCNT-N was fractionated by passing it through a sieve with a pore size of 25?μm. The average lengths of the MWCNT were 4.2?μm before filtration and 2.6?μm in the flow-through fraction; the length of the retained MWCNT could not be determined. For the present study, 10-week-old F344/Crj male rats were divided into five groups: no treatment, vehicle control, MWCNT-N before filtration, MWCNT-N flow-through and MWCNT-N retained groups. Administration was by the trans-tracheal intrapulmonary spraying (TIPS) method. Rats were administered a total of 1?mg/rat during the initial 2?weeks of the experiment and then observed up to 109?weeks. The incidences of malignant mesothelioma and lung tumors (bronchiolo-alveolar adenomas and carcinomas) were 6/38 and 14/38, respectively, in the three groups administered MWCNT and 0/28 and 0/28, respectively, in the control groups. All malignant mesotheliomas were localized in the pericardial pleural cavity. The sieve fractions did not have a significant effect on tumor incidence. In conclusion, administration of MWCNT to the lung in the rat induces malignant mesothelioma and lung tumors. ? 2016 The Authors.

These symptoms reduce their health-related quality of life. Our aims were to evaluate the relationship between proton pump inhibitor efficacy and health-related quality of life and to evaluate predictive factors affecting treatment response in Japanese patients. Using the gastroesophageal reflux disease questionnaire, 145 gastroesophageal reflux disease patients undergoing proton pump inhibitor therapy were evaluated and classified as responders or partial-responders. Their health-related quality of life was then evaluated using the 8-item Short Form Health Survey, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale questionnaires. Sixty-nine patients (47.6%) were partial responders. These patients had significantly lower scores than responders in 5/8 subscales and in the mental health component summary of the 8-item Short Form Health Survey. Partial responders had significantly higher Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale scores, including anxiety and depression scores, than those of responders. Non-erosive reflux disease and double proton pump inhibitor doses were predictive factors of partial responders.

However, no scale of this kind exists in Japan. The aims of this study were to validate the Japanese Culturally Modified Version of the CADIS (JCMV-CADIS) and to describe the family impact of children with AD in a Japanese context. Methods Participants included primary-caregivers for children with AD between 2 and 6 years of age. Interviews were conducted, and new items for the Japanese version were drafted. Reliability and validity were evaluated and compared with the original CADIS, and unique features of the Japanese version were analyzed. Results Exploratory factor analysis revealed the following factors: “Symptoms” and “Activity Limitations and Behavior” in the Child domain, and “Emotions Related to Social Factors,” “Emotions Related to the Child's Condition,” “Family and Social Function,” “Complexity of Care,” and “Approaches to Management of AD in Daily Life” in the Parent domain. The latter two factors were unique to the JCMV-CADIS and were not derived from the Original. “Emotion” was split into two independent factors. All factors showed good reliability (internal consistency and stability) and validity (concurrent validity and discriminant validity), except for the concurrent validity of “Approaches to Management of AD in Daily Life.” This factor seemed to reflect characteristics similar to the family-related function. Conclusions The JCMV-CADIS is a QoL scale developed for Japanese children with AD and their families. Further evaluation of clinical applicability is needed. ? 2016 Japanese Society of Allergology",Atopic dermatitis; Child; Family; Quality of life; Reliability and validity,"allergic conjunctivitis; allergic rhinitis; allergy; Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; caregiver; child; Childhood Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale; concurrent validity; Dermatitis Family Impact; discriminant validity; emotion; exploratory factor analysis; family; Family Assessment Inventory; female; food allergy; human; interview; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; Parenting Stress Short Form; preschool child; priority journal; questionnaire; Severity Scoring of Atopic Dermatitis; social status; comorbidity; cultural anthropology; Dermatitis, Atopic; health survey; Japan; quality of life; reproducibility; risk factor; severity of illness index; Caregivers; Child; Child, Preschool; Comorbidity; Culture; Dermatitis, Atopic; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Population Surveillance; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index",2-s2.0-84975458199

It is estimated that there will be more Asians with AMD than the rest of the world combined by 2050. In Asian populations, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is a common subtype of exudative AMD, while choroidal neovascularization secondary to AMD (CNV-AMD) is the typical subtype in Western populations. The two subtypes share many common clinical features and risk factors, but also have different epidemiological and clinical characteristics, natural history and treatment outcomes that point to distinct pathophysiological processes. Recent research in the fields of genetics, proteomics and imaging has provided further clarification of differences between PCV and CNV-AMD. Importantly, these differences have manifested as disparity in response to intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment between PCV and CNV-AMD, emphasizing the need for accurate diagnosis of PCV and in distinguishing PCV from CNV-AMD, particularly in Asian patients. Current clinical trials of intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and photodynamic therapy will provide clearer perspectives of evidence-based management of PCV and may lead to paradigm shifts in therapeutic strategies away from those currently employed in the treatment of CNV-AMD. Further research is needed to clarify the relative contribution of specific pathways in inflammation, complement activation, extracellular matrix dysregulation, lipid metabolism and angiogenesis to the pathogenesis of PCV. Findings from this research, together with improved diagnostic technology and new therapeutics, will facilitate more optimal management of Asian AMD. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor; Asian age-related macular degeneration; Choroidal neovascularization; Laser photocoagulation; Photodynamic therapy; Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy,"aflibercept; bevacizumab; biological marker; C reactive protein; conbercept; homocysteine; matrix metalloproteinase; pegaptanib; ranibizumab; vasculotropin inhibitor; verteporfin; age related macular degeneration; Asian; autofluorescence imaging; B scan; central serous retinopathy; choroidal thickness; choroidal vascular hyperpermeability; clinical feature; confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; disease association; disease classification; drug response; enzyme blood level; fluorescence angiography; fundus autofluorescence; histology; human; incidence; indocyanine green angiography; laser coagulation; molecular genetics; multimodal imaging; optical coherence tomography; pathogenesis; peripapillary polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; peripapillary polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; photodynamic therapy; polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; predictive value; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; protein blood level; recurrent disease; retina disease; retina macula hemorrhage; Review; risk factor; scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; treatment response; vision; visual system parameters; Asian continental ancestry group; Choroid Diseases; diagnostic imaging; genetics; macular degeneration; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Choroid Diseases; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Tomography, Optical Coherence",2-s2.0-84963972533

However, no pharmacological therapy has been shown to improve survival in HFpEF patients. Previous retrospective and prospective observational studies have examined the prognostic impact of hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors (statins) in patients with HFpEF. However, the results are inconsistent due to limited power with small sample sizes and/or lack of adjustment for known prognostic factors and differences in baseline characteristics between patients treated with and without statins. Methods We aimed to conduct a meta-analysis of prospective observational studies examining the effect of statin therapy on mortality in HFpEF patients with the use of propensity score analysis. Results A total of 4 studies with 5,536 patients (2,768 patients [50%] on statins; mean age, 65-77 years; male, 43-66%; coronary artery disease, 42-64%; hypertension, 61-82%; diabetes, 20-29%; follow-up duration, 12-36 months) were included in this meta-analysis.

Mouth breathing may bypass the protective function of the nose and is anecdotally considered to increase asthma morbidity. However, there is no epidemiological evidence that mouth breathing is independently associated with asthma morbidity and sensitization to allergens. In this study, we aimed to clarify the association between mouth breathing and asthma morbidity and allergic/eosinophilic inflammation, while considering the effect of allergic rhinitis. Methods This community-based cohort study, the Nagahama Study, contained a self-reporting questionnaire on mouth breathing and medical history, blood tests, and pulmonary function testing. We enrolled 9804 general citizens of Nagahama City in the Shiga Prefecture, Japan. Results Mouth breathing was reported by 17% of the population and was independently associated with asthma morbidity. The odds ratio for asthma morbidity was 1.85 (95% CI, 1.27-2.62) and 2.20 (95% CI, 1.72-2.80) in subjects with mouth breathing alone and allergic rhinitis alone, which additively increased to 4.09 (95% CI, 3.01-5.52) when mouth breathing and allergic rhinitis coexisted. Mouth breathing in nonasthmatics was a risk for house dust mite sensitization, higher blood eosinophil counts, and lower pulmonary function after adjusting for allergic rhinitis. Conclusion Mouth breathing may increase asthma morbidity, potentially through increased sensitization to inhaled allergens, which highlights the risk of mouth-bypass breathing in the 'one airway, one disease' concept. The risk of mouth breathing should be well recognized in subjects with allergic rhinitis and in the general population. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

The impact of GERD symptoms on cough-specific quality of life (QoL) in patients with asthmatic cough is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to determine the association of GERD symptoms with cough-specific quality of life in patients with cough variant asthma (CVA) using the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ). Methods A total of 172 consecutive patients (121 females) with mean cough duration of 45.1 months (range 2–480 months) completed the Japanese version of the LCQ. The Frequency Scale for the Symptoms of Gastroesophageal reflux was administered to assess symptoms of acid-reflux and dysmotility. A range of clinical variables that may determine cough-specific QoL (LCQ) were estimated. Results The mean LCQ scores was 12.9 (SD 3.5), consistent with severe impairment in QoL. Female gender, symptoms of gastroesophageal dysmotility, sensitization to allergens (house dust and Japanese cedar pollen) and the number of sensitized allergens were associated with lower LCQ scores (i.e. impaired cough-specific QoL) in univariate regression analysis. Acid-reflux symptoms, airway hyperresponsiveness, fractional exhaled nitric oxide, and sensitization to molds were unrelated to the LCQ score. After adjustment for gender, symptoms of gastroesophageal dysmotility was the only significant determinant of impaired cough-specific QoL accounting for 23% of the variance. Conclusions Cough-specific QoL is severely impaired in patients with CVA.

Interferon-based antiviral therapy to eradicate HCV is less effective in patients receiving hemodialysis than patients without renal dysfunction. Recently reported combination therapy with two oral direct-acting antiviral drugs, daclatasvir and asunaprevir, both of which are metabolized in the liver and excreted into the bile ducts, reportedly showed a high rate of HCV eradication. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of this therapy in patients receiving hemodialysis. Methods: The safety and viral responses were compared among patients infected with HCV genotype 1, between 28 patients receiving hemodialysis, and propensity score-matched 56 patients without renal dysfunction. Results: The reduction in serum HCV RNA levels 1?day after the start of therapy was significantly larger (p?=?0.0329) and the disappearance of serum HCV RNA occurred significantly earlier (p?=?0.0017) in patients receiving hemodialysis than those without renal dysfunction. The rates of sustained virologic response, i.e., the eradication of HCV, were comparable between two groups; the rate of SVR12 was 100?% in patients receiving hemodialysis and 94.6?% in patients without renal dysfunction. No adverse constitutional events were observed in either of the groups. The elevation of serum alanine aminotransferase levels, a known adverse effect of these drugs, was observed in comparable rate of patients between the two groups.

Here, we report the design, synthesis and evaluation of the (7-diethylaminocoumarin-4-yl)methyl ester of suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (AC-SAHA) as a caged HDAC inhibitor, which releases the known pan-HDAC inhibitor SAHA upon cleavage of the photolabile (7-diethylaminocoumarin-4-yl)methyl protecting group in response to photoirradiation. A key advantage of AC-SAHA is that the caged derivative itself shows essentially no HDAC-inhibitory activity. Upon photoirradiation, AC-SAHA decomposes to SAHA and a 7-diethylaminocoumarin derivative, together with some minor products. We confirmed that AC-SAHA inhibits HDAC in response to photoirradiation in vitro by means of chemiluminescence assay.

The aim of this study was to examine whether a novel training program aimed at enhancing oncology nurses' ability to assess and manage common psychological problems in cancer patients would improve participants' self-reported confidence, knowledge, and attitudes regarding care of patients with common psychological problems (trial register: UMIN000008559). Methods: Oncology nurses were assigned randomly to either the intervention group (N = 50) or the waiting list control group (N = 46). The intervention group received a 16-h program, the content of which focused on four psychological issues: normal reactions, clinically significant distress, suicidal thoughts, and delirium. Each session included a role-play exercise, group work, and didactic lecture regarding assessment and management of each problem. Primary outcomes were changes in self-reported confidence, knowledge, and attitudes toward the common psychological problems between pre-intervention and 3?months post-intervention. Secondary outcomes were job-related stress and burnout. Intervention acceptability to participants was also assessed. Results: In the intervention group, confidence and knowledge but not attitudes were significantly improved relative to the control group. No significant intervention effects were found for job- related stress and burnout. A high percentage (98%) of participants considered the program useful in clinical practice. Conclusions: This psycho-oncology training program improved oncology nurses' confidence and knowledge regarding care for patients with psychological problems. Copyright ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Since 2004, the initiative has conducted three pilot studies. The first two were N- and O-glycan analyses of purified transferrin and immunoglobulin-G and assessed the most appropriate analytical approach employed at the time. This paper describes the third study, which was conducted to compare different approaches for quantitation of N- and O-linked glycans attached to proteins in crude biological samples. The preliminary analysis on cell pellets resulted in wildly varied glycan profiles, which was probably the consequence of variations in the pre-processing sample preparation methodologies. However, the reproducibility of the data was not improved dramatically in the subsequent analysis on cell lysate fractions prepared in a specified method by one lab. The study demonstrated the difficulty of carrying out a complete analysis of the glycome in crude samples by any single technology and the importance of rigorous optimization of the course of analysis from preprocessing to data interpretation. It suggests that another collaborative study employing the latest technologies in this rapidly evolving field will help to realize the requirements of carrying out the large-scale analysis of glycoproteins in complex cell samples. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Glycoproteomics; Human disease glycomics/proteome initiative (HGPI); Human proteome organization (HUPO),"alditol; fucose; glycopeptide; glycoprotein; immunoglobulin G; n linked glycan; o linked glycan; sialic acid; sialyl Lewis x antigen; transferrin; unclassified drug; biological marker; glycoprotein; polysaccharide; analytic method; Article; cancer cell line; carbohydrate analysis; cell culture; cell lysate; cell membrane; controlled study; cytosolic fraction; electrospray mass spectrometry; extraction; follow up; glycobiology; high performance liquid chromatography; intermethod comparison; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; pilot study; priority journal; process optimization; protein analysis; protein glycosylation; quantitative analysis; reproducibility; chemistry; clinical trial; comparative study; human; mass spectrometry; molecular diagnosis; multicenter study; procedures; proteomics; standards; tumor cell line; Biomarkers; Cell Line, Tumor; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Glycomics; Glycoproteins; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Molecular Diagnostic Techniques; Polysaccharides; Proteomics; Reproducibility of Results",2-s2.0-84975780471

Setting, participants and outcome measures: We sought PubMed for cohort studies, where LDL-C had been investigated as a risk factor for all-cause and/or CV mortality in individuals ? 60 years from the general population. Results: We identified 19 cohort studies including 30 cohorts with a total of 68 094 elderly people, where all-cause mortality was recorded in 28 cohorts and CV mortality in 9 cohorts. Inverse association between allcause mortality and LDL-C was seen in 16 cohorts (in 14 with statistical significance) representing 92% of the number of participants, where this association was recorded. In the rest, no association was found. In two cohorts, CV mortality was highest in the lowest LDL-C quartile and with statistical significance; in seven cohorts, no association was found. Conclusions: High LDL-C is inversely associated with mortality in most people over 60 years. This finding is inconsistent with the cholesterol hypothesis (ie, that cholesterol, particularly LDL-C, is inherently atherogenic). Since elderly people with high LDL-C live as long or longer than those with low LDL-C, our analysis provides reason to question the validity of the cholesterol hypothesis. Moreover, our study provides the rationale for a re-evaluation of guidelines recommending pharmacological reduction of LDL-C in the elderly as a component of cardiovascular disease prevention strategies. ?

Since multiple genotypes of norovirus co-circulate in humans, changing the genotype composition and eluding host immunity, development of a polyvalent vaccine against norovirus in which the genotypes of vaccine strains match the major strains in circulation in the target season is desirable. However, this would require prediction of changes in the genotype composition of circulating strains. A fitness model that predicts the proportion of a strain in the next season from that in the current season has been developed for influenza A virus. Here, such a fitness model that takes into account the fitness effect of herd immunity was used to predict genotype compositions in norovirus seasons in Japan. In the current study, a model that assumes a decline in the magnitude of cross immunity between norovirus strains according to an increase in the divergence of the major antigenic protein VP1 was found to be appropriate for predicting genotype composition. Although it is difficult to predict the proportions of genotypes accurately, the model is effective in predicting the direction of change in the proportions of genotypes. The model predicted that GII.3 and GII.4 may contract, whereas GII.17 may expand and predominate in the 2015–2016 season.

The aim of this study was to test the robustness of the visual assessment method for florbetaben scans, comparing efficacy readouts across different interpreters and training methods and against a histopathology standard of truth (SoT). Methods: Analysis was based on data from an international open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter phase-3 study in patients with or without dementia (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01020838). Florbetaben scans were assessed visually and quantitatively, and results were compared with amyloid plaque scores. For visual assessment, either in-person training (n = 3 expert interpreters) or an electronic training method (n = 5 na?ve interpreters) was used. Brain samples from participants who died during the study were used to determine the histopathologic SoT using Bielschowsky silver staining (BSS) and immunohistochemistry for β-amyloid plaques. Results: Data were available from 82 patients who died and underwent postmortem histopathology. When visual assessment results were compared with BSS 1 immunohistochemistry as SoT, median sensitivity was 98.2% for the in-person-trained interpreters and 96.4% for the e-trained interpreters, and median specificity was 92.3% and 88.5%, respectively. Median accuracy was 95.1% and 91.5%, respectively. On the basis of BSS only as the SoT, median sensitivity was 98.1% and 96.2%, respectively; median specificity was 80.0% and 76.7%, respectively; and median accuracy was 91.5% and 86.6%, respectively. Interinterpreter agreement (Fleiss κ) was excellent (0.89) for in-person-trained interpreters and very good (0.71) for e-trained interpreters. Median intrainterpreter agreement was 0.9 for both in person-trained and e-trained interpreters. Visual and quantitative assessments were concordant in 88.9% of scans for in-person-trained interpreters and in 87.7% of scans for e-trained interpreters. Conclusion: Visual assessment of florbetaben images was robust in challenging scans from elderly end-of-life individuals. Sensitivity, specificity, and interinterpreter agreement were high, independent of expertise and training method. Visual assessment was accurate and reliable for detection of plaques using BSS and immunohistochemistry and well correlated with quantitative assessments.

Design Reliability and validity analysis. Methods Ultra-wide-field fluorescein angiography (FA) and ICGA images were obtained using an ultra-wide-field imaging device (Optos California ultra-wide-field imaging device; Dunfermline, Scotland, UK) in 11 eyes of 11 patients without chorioretinal diseases. The angiographic signals of the choroidal vessels were determined by subtracting those of the retinal vasculature and optic disc on the FA images from the ICGA images, binarized by Niblack's method, and the choroidal vessel density calculated. Reproducibility of the method was assessed by calculating the coefficient of variance, coefficient of repeatability, and intraclass correlation coefficient. The relationships between age, spherical equivalent refractive error (SERE), and intraocular pressure and the vasculature density were assessed. To investigate possible impacts of chorioretinal diseases on the vasculature density, 10 eyes of 7 patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC) were compared with the 11 control eyes. Results Choroidal vessels were contrasted by binarizing ICGA images. The method to quantify the choroidal vessel density showed high reproducibility. The SERE was correlated significantly (r = 0.573, P <.05) with the vasculature density. In the 11 control eyes, the vasculature density was 34.26% ± 0.77% in the entire area, 31.37% ± 0.97% in the superior portion, 36.98% ± 0.88% in the inferior portion, 37.01% ± 1.44% in the posterior portion, and 34.17% ± 0.77% in the peripheral portion. In eyes with CSC, the density was significantly (P <.05) higher: 36.46% ± 0.49%, 34.02% ± 0.97%, 38.65% ± 0.27%, 41.04% ± 0.82%, and 36.36% ± 0.51%, respectively. Conclusions Binarization of ultra-wide-field ICGA images enabled quantification of the choroidal vessel density, which was altered in eyes with CSC. This method of measuring the choroidal vessel density may provide new insights into diagnosing and treating chorioretinal diseases. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This study was aimed at comparing its usefulness with quantitative HBsAg in patients with HBeAg-positive CHB receiving PEG-IFN therapy. Methods: A total 46 patients treated with PEG-IFN for 48 weeks were retrospectively analysed. Intrahepatic covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) from paired liver biopsies and serial serum HBsAg and HBcrAg during therapy were assessed. Results: Virological response (VR), defined as HBeAg clearance and HBV DNA &lt;2000 IU/ml at 24 weeks post treatment, was achieved in 15 (32.6%) patients. Responders had significantly higher cccDNA decline from baseline compared with non-responders. Baseline HBsAg and HBcrAg were correlated with cccDNA (r = 0.424, P = 0.020 and r = 0.564, P = 0.001, respectively), and changes in the corresponding markers during therapy were correlated with cccDNA reduction (r = 0.579, P = 0.001 and r = 0.503, P = 0.005, respectively). Responders showed more rapid decline of both markers during therapy compared with non-responders. In multivariate analysis, serum HBcrAg at week 12 was identified as a predictor of VR. The optimal cut-off value for HBcrAg (log10 8.0 U/ml) provided negative predictive value (NPV) of achieving VR at weeks 12 and 24 of 94.4 and 100%, respectively, while using HBsAg &gt; 20 000 IU/ml provided NPV of 80 and 100% respectively. Conclusions: The convenient quantitative HBcrAg represented a reliable marker of intrahepatic cccDNA. Monitoring HBcrAg levels during PEG-IFN therapy may help identify patients with a very low probability of response comparable to, if not better than, quantitative HBsAg. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",HBsAg quantification; Hepatitis B core-related antigen; Hepatitis B virus; Pegylated interferon,"circular DNA; covalently closed circular DNA; hepatitis B core antigen; hepatitis B core related antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; peginterferon; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; unclassified drug; virus DNA; antivirus agent; biological marker; circular DNA; hepatitis B core antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; interferon; virus DNA; adult; antiviral therapy; Article; blood level; chronic hepatitis B; clinical article; controlled study; drug response; female; human; liver biopsy; male; predictive value; prognosis; reference value; retrospective study; Thai (people); viral clearance; virus load; blood; chronic hepatitis B; genetics; Hepatitis B virus; liver; multivariate analysis; pathology; receiver operating characteristic; statistical model; sustained virologic response; Thailand; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers; DNA, Circular; DNA, Viral; Female; Hepatitis B Core Antigens; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Interferons; Liver; Logistic Models; Male; Multivariate Analysis; ROC Curve; Sustained Virologic Response; Thailand",2-s2.0-84966783616

Moxifloxacin (400 mg) was administered orally to 20 subjects, and plasma and urine levels of moxifloxacin and its metabolite (M2) were measured. Simvastatin (20 mg) was given to 40 subjects, and plasma levels of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were measured. Meloxicam (7.5 mg) was given to 30 subjects and its plasma concentration was determined. Intrinsic factors (polymorphism of UGT1A1 for moxifloxacin, SLCO1B1 for simvastatin, and CYP2C9 for meloxicam) were also examined. Results AUCinf values for moxifloxacin, simvastatin and meloxicam showed no significant differences among the East Asian groups. Cmax values of moxifloxacin and simvastatin, but not meloxicam, showed significant differences. There were no significant differences of data for M2 or simvastatin acid. Genetic analysis identified significant differences in the frequencies of relevant polymorphisms, but these differences did not affect the PK parameters observed. Conclusions Although there were some differences in PK parameters among the three East Asian groups, the present study performed under strictly controlled conditions did not reproduce the major ethnic differences observed in previous studies. ? 2016 The Authors.

Fifty-two patients with GH-PA were treated with hypofractionated SRT between September 2001 and October 2012. Eight patients had clinically silent GH-PA and 44 were symptomatic. Only 1 patient was inoperable. The other patients had recurrent or postoperative residual tumors on MRI. All patients had received pharmacotherapy prior to SRT with a somatostatin analog, dopamine agonist, and/or GH receptor antagonist. The marginal doses were 17.4–26.8?Gy for the 3-fraction schedule and 20.0–32.0?Gy for the 5-fraction schedule. Endocrinological remission was assessed by the Cortina consensus criteria 2010 (random GH?<1?ng/ml or nadir GH after an oral glucose tolerance test?<0.4?ng/ml and normalization of age- and sex-adjusted insulin-like growth factor-1). The median follow-up period was 60?months (range 27–137). The 5-year overall survival, local control, and disease-free survival rates were 100, 100, and 96?%, respectively. Nine patients (5 clinically silent and 4 symptomatic patients) satisfied the Cortina criteria without receiving further pharmacotherapy, whereas the remaining 43 patients did not. No post-SRT grade 2 or higher visual disorder occurred. Symptomatic post-SRT hypopituitarism was observed in 1 patient. CyberKnife hypofractionated SRT is safe and effective when judged by imaging findings for GH-PA. However, it may be difficult to satisfy the Cortina consensus criteria in most symptomatic patients with SRT alone. Further investigations of optimal treatments are warranted. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Cortina consensus; CyberKnife; Growth hormone-secreting pituitary adenoma; Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy; Optic pathway,dopamine receptor stimulating agent; growth hormone; growth hormone receptor blocking agent; hormone receptor blocking agent; somatomedin C; somatostatin derivative; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer control; cancer radiotherapy; clinical effectiveness; clinical trial; consensus; CyberKnife; disease free survival; feasibility study; female; follow up; growth hormone secreting adenoma; hormone determination; human; human tissue; hypofractionated radiotherapy; hypopituitarism; major clinical study; male; minimal residual disease; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oral glucose tolerance test; outcome assessment; overall survival; patient safety; postoperative period; prospective study; radiotherapy planning system; reference value; stereotactic radiosurgery; survival rate; survival time; symptom; treatment response; tumor recurrence; tumor regression; visual disorder; adenoma; growth hormone secreting adenoma; metabolism; middle aged; procedures; radiosurgery; radiotherapy dosage; survival analysis; treatment outcome; young adult; Adenoma; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Growth Hormone-Secreting Pituitary Adenoma; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Dosage; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84960101620

The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical features, treatment modalities and prognosis of bone metastasis in cervical cancer patients in Japan. Methods The medical records of 75 cervical cancer patients with bone metastasis who were treated between January 2000 and December 2010 were retrospectively analyzed in a multi-institutional study. Results Fifty-four patients (72.0%) had a single bone metastasis. Bone metastases were found in the spine (46.7%) and pelvis (42.7%). Forty-three patients (57.3%) also had extra-osseous metastases. Most of the patients received radiotherapy, chemotherapy or both, but 25 patients (33.3%) received palliative care only. Bisphosphonates were given as palliative therapy to 25 patients (33.3%). The median overall survival after the diagnosis of bone metastasis was significantly shorter in patients with extra-osseous metastases than in those without extra-osseous metastases (14 vs 5 months; P < 0.05). The survival of patients who received chemotherapy following radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy was significantly longer than that of the patients who received palliative care. On multivariate analysis, the presence of extra-osseous metastasis was an independent predictor of survival in patients with bone metastasis from cervical cancer.

Methods: Data collected between 1990 and 2012 from the Japan Public Health Centre-based Prospective Study were analyzed, and Poisson regression models were used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (RR) for external causes of death. Results: The population-based cohort comprised 105,408 Japanese residents (49,484 men and 55,924 women; mean age: 51.2 [SD 7.9] years). At baseline, 3250 (6.6%) men and 1648 (3.0%) women had a history of DM. During the follow-up period, 113 external deaths (41 suicides and 72 accidents) were noted among those with a history of DM, with 1304 external deaths (577 suicides and 727 accidents) among those without such a history. A higher risk of external death (men, RR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.2-1.8; women, RR: 1.6, 95% CI: 1.01-2.4) was observed in those with a history of DM. Also, among those aged 40-49 years (RR: 1.9, 95% CI: 1.3-2.7) and 50-59 years (RR: 1.4, 95% CI: 1.05-1.9) at baseline, the risk of external death was significantly higher in those with a history of DM.

However, because of its low incidence, reliable survival estimates and prognostic factors based on a large number of patients remain to be elucidated, thereby making it impossible to standardize the optimal treatment for SDC. Methods: We performed this multi-institutional, retrospective analysis by collecting the clinical information of 141 patients with SDC without distant metastasis who underwent curative surgery as the initial treatment to elucidate overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) along with their prognostic factors. Results: The 3-year OS and DFS rates were 70.5 and 38.2?%, respectively. Multivariate analysis revealed that age ?65?years (p?<?0.001) and N1 and N2 (p?=?0.047 and <0.001, respectively) were independent prognostic factors for OS, whereas the primary site of the minor salivary and sublingual gland (p?<?0.001) and N2 (p?<?0.001) were those for DFS. The most common treatment failure was distant metastasis (55 patients, 39.0?%). For early parotid SDC, neither total parotidectomy in the patients with early T stage nor nerve resection in the patients without facial nerve palsy showed survival benefits. Conclusions: Advanced N stage independently affects both OS and DFS. Partial parotidectomy with facial nerve preservation could be a less invasive standard surgical procedure for parotid gland SDC in the early T stage without facial nerve palsy. Effective systemic therapy is imperative to improve DFS of SDC. ? 2016, The Author(s).",,"aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer surgery; cancer survival; disease free survival; distant metastasis; facial nerve paralysis; female; human; information; major clinical study; male; outcome assessment; overall survival; parotidectomy; retrospective study; salivary gland; salivary gland carcinoma; salivary gland duct; sublingual gland; treatment failure; adult; clinical trial; follow up; middle aged; multicenter study; Paget nipple disease; pathology; prognosis; salivary gland tumor; survival rate; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Ductal; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Salivary Gland Neoplasms; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-84954531982

Some cases of Wernicke encephalopathy are related to appetite loss; however, the degree to which loss of appetite leads to thiamine deficiency is not known. Method: A 63-year-old female with advanced cancer of the external genitalia was referred for psychiatric consultation because of disorientation, insomnia, and bizarre behaviors. Her symptoms fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for delirium. Routine laboratory examinations did not reveal the cause of the delirium. Thiamine deficiency was suspected because appetite loss had continued for 19 days since she had been admitted to hospital. Results: Intravenous administration of thiamine resulted in recovery from the delirium within three days. Serum thiamine level was found to be 16 ng/ml (normal range: 24-66 ng/ml). The clinical findings, the low level of thiamine in the serum, and the effective alleviation of delirious symptoms after thiamine administration fulfilled Francis's criteria for delirium induced by thiamine deficiency. Significance of results: Clinicians must be aware of the possibility of Wernicke encephalopathy in cancer patients, especially in those with loss of appetite for longer than 18 days. The degree of appetite loss in such patients might serve as a reference. Early detection and intervention may alleviate the symptoms of delirium and prevent irreversible brain damage. ?

Nevertheless, guidelines from relevant medical societies recommend using cholesterol lowering medication (statin) for both types of patients. Medicines with several different action mechanisms have been developed, and the effectiveness of different lifestyle modifications has been studied extensively for the prevention of DM, which was successful in improving clinical marker status in relatively short-term treatments, but none have been shown to be effective in improving long-term outcomes (mortality from CVD and all causes). Summary: Statin-induced suppression of prenyl intermediates in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway has been linked to stimulated atherosclerosis and heart failure. On the other hand, certain types of vegetable oil and hydrogenated oil shortened the survival of stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats by decreasing platelet number, increasing hemorrhagic tendency and damaging kidney functions, which could not be accounted for by their fatty acid and phytosterol compositions. These vegetable oils and medicines such as statin and warfarin share, in part, a common mechanism to inhibit vitamin K2-dependent processes, which was interpreted to lead to increased onset of CVD, DM, chronic kidney disease, bone fracture and even mental disorder. Impaired vitamin K2-dependent processes by some types of vegetable oils and medicines, but not plasma high low density lipoprotein cholesterol, were proposed as the cause of CVD, DM and other lifestyle-related diseases. High n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio of ingested foods, but not animal fats, was emphasized to be another risk factor for many of the diseases described above. Key Messages: To date, no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been performed to prove the above interpretation. However, the opposite types of RCT trials have been performed by increasing the intake of high-linoleic vegetable oils and reducing that of animal fats, which resulted in increased CVD and all-cause mortality.

The aim of our study was to examine the important role of the axis in pancreatic cancer (PaCa) cells' relationship with stromal cells in gemcitabine-resistant (GEM-R) tumors and to confirm the effectiveness of CXCR4 antagonists for the treatment of GEM-R PaCa cells. Methods: We established two GEM-R PaCa cell lines using MIA PaCa-2 and AsPC-1 cells. The expression of CXCR4 mRNA in PaCa cells and the expression of CXCL12 mRNA in fibroblasts were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The expression of CXCR4 protein in PaCa cells was examined by immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunocytochemistry. Using Matrigel invasion assays and animal studies, we then examined the effects of two CXCR4 antagonists, AMD11070 and KRH3955, on the invasiveness and tumorigenicity of GEM-R PaCa cells stimulated by CXCL12. Results: We found that the expression of CXCR4 in GEM-R PaCa cells was significantly enhanced by GEM but not in normal GEM-sensitive (GEM-S) PaCa cells. In RT-PCR and ELISA assays, the production and secretion of CXCL12 from fibroblasts was significantly enhanced by co-culturing with GEM-R PaCa cells treated with GEM. In Matrigel invasion assays, the invasiveness of GEM-R PaCa cells treated with GEM was significantly activated by fibroblast-derived CXCL12 and was significantly inhibited by CXCR4 antagonists, AMD11070 and KRH3955. In vivo, the tumorigenicity of GEM-R PaCa cells was activated by GEM, and it was significantly inhibited by the addition with CXCR4 antagonists. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate that the CXCL12-CXCR4 signaling axis plays an important role in PaCa cells' resistance to GEM. CXCR4 expression was significantly enhanced by the exposure to GEM in GEM-R PaCa cells but not in GEM-S PaCa cells. Furthermore, CXCR4 antagonists can inhibit the growth and invasion of GEM-R PaCa cells. These agents may be useful as second-line chemotherapy for GEM-R PaCa in the future. ? 2016 Morimoto et al.",CXCL12; CXCR4; CXCR4 antagonist; Gemcitabine resistant; Pancreatic cancer,"antineoplastic antimetabolite; chemokine receptor CXCR4; CXCL12 protein, human; CXCR4 protein, human; deoxycytidine; gemcitabine; N'-((1H-benzo(d)imidazol-2-yl)methyl)-N'-(5,6,7,8-tetrahydroquinolin-8-yl)butane-1,4-diamine; single heterocyclic rings; stromal cell derived factor 1; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; apoptosis; Bagg albino mouse; cell proliferation; drug effects; drug screening; female; fibroblast; human; metabolism; mouse; nude mouse; Pancreatic Neoplasms; pathology; stroma cell; tumor cell culture; Animals; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Apoptosis; Cell Proliferation; Chemokine CXCL12; Deoxycytidine; Female; Fibroblasts; Heterocyclic Compounds, 1-Ring; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Receptors, CXCR4; Stromal Cells; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84971246363

Historically speaking, Flocks et al first identified antigenic properties in prostate tissue in 1960. Then, Barnes et al detected immunologic characteristics in prostatic fluid in 1963. Hara et al characterized Y-semino-protein in semen in 1966, and it has been proven to be identical to PSA. Subsequently, Ablin et al independently reported the presence of precipitation antigens in the prostate in 1970. Wang et al purified the PSA in 1979, and Kuriyama et al first applied an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for PSA in 1980. However, the positive predictive value with a cutoff figure of 4.0 ng/mL appeared substantially low (?30%). There are overdiagnoses and overtreatments for latent/low-risk PCa. Controversies exist in the PCa mortality-reducing effects of PSA screening between the European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (ERSPC) and the US Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. For optimizing PCa screening, PSA-related items may require the following: 1) adjustment of the cutoff values according to age, as well as setting limits to age and screening intervals; 2) improving test performance using doubling time, density, and ratio of free: total PSA; and 3) fostering active surveillance for low-risk PCa with monitoring by PSA value. Other items needing consideration may include the following: 1) examinations of cell proliferation and cell cycle markers in biopsy specimens; 2) independent quantification of Gleason grading; 3) developing ethnicity-specific staging nomograms based on tumor stage, PSA value, and Gleason score; 4) delineation of the natural history; 5) revisiting the significance of the androgen/testosterone hypothesis; and 6) devoting special attention to individuals with a certain genetic predisposition. Finally, considering the uncertainty that exists in medicine, risk communication on PSA-based screening is indeed due. ? 2016 Tokudome et al.",Application; Benefits and harm; Discovery; Optimization; PCa screening; PSA,androgen; prostate specific antigen; testosterone; age; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cancer screening; cancer staging; cancer survival; cell cycle; cell proliferation; clinical decision making; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; ethnicity; Gleason score; human; Note; patient monitoring; predictive value; process optimization; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer,2-s2.0-84975041748

The relationship between cholesterol level in the central nervous system and Alzheimer's disease has been reported. In this study, we examined the effects of ABCG1 and ABCG4 on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, the product of which, amyloid β (Aβ), is involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Expression of ABCG1 or ABCG4 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells that stably expressed Swedish-type mutant APP increased cellular and cell surface APP levels. Products of cleavage from APP by α-secretase and by β-secretase also increased. The levels of secreted Aβ, however, decreased in the presence of ABCG1 and ABCG4, but not ABCG4-KM, a nonfunctional Walker-A lysine mutant. In contrast, secreted Aβ levels increased in differentiated SH-SY5Y neuron-like cells in which ABCG1 and ABCG4 were suppressed. Furthermore, Aβ42 peptide in the cerebrospinal fluid from Abcg1 null mice significantly increased compared to the wild type mice. To examine the underlying mechanism, we analyzed the activity and distribution of γ-secretase. ABCG1 and ABCG4 suppressed γ-secretase activity and disturbed γ-secretase localization in the raft domains where γ-secretase functions. These results suggest that ABCG1 and ABCG4 alter the distribution of γ-secretase on the plasma membrane, leading to the decreased γ-secretase activity and suppressed Aβ secretion. ABCG1 and ABCG4 may inhibit the development of Alzheimer's disease and can be targets for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. ? 2016, Public Library of Science. All rights reserved.

Material and methods This study included six surgical patients, who underwent segmental mandibulectomy and simultaneous reconstruction with a free fibula osteocutaneous flap, and four controls. 4D CT was performed during mastication of a cookie to evaluate the movement of the jaw during natural function. The maximum mouth opening, mastication time, and movement of the mandibular angle during mastication were evaluated from the 4D CT images. Results 4D CT images enabled visualization of jaw movement during mastication. When compared with the controls, the maximum mouth opening during mastication and excursion of the mandibular angle, especially on the diseased side, tended to decrease in surgical patients; however, this did not occur with mastication time. The numerical differences between the diseased and nondiseased side in surgical patients tended to be higher than the crosswise differences in controls. Conclusion 4D CT images revealed differences in jaw function between patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction and controls. 4D CT could be used to evaluate postoperative outcomes following mandibular reconstruction. ? 2016 European Association for Cranio-Maxillo-Facial Surgery.

We have previously reported that HSP27 is released from human platelets associated with collagen-induced phosphorylation. In the present study, we conducted an investigation into the effect of thrombin receptor-activating protein (TRAP) on the release of HSP27 in platelets in type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) patients. The phosphorylated-HSP27 levels induced by TRAP were directly proportional to the aggregation of platelets. The levels of phosphorylated-HSP27 (Ser-78) were correlated with the levels of phosphorylated-p38 MAP kinase and phosphorylated-Akt in the platelets stimulated by 10 ?M TRAP but not with those of phosphorylated-p44/p42 MAP kinase. The levels of HSP27 released from the TRAP (10 ?M)-stimulated platelets were correlated with the levels of phosphorylated-HSP27 in the platelets. The released platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) levels were in parallel with the HSP27 levels released from the platelets stimulated by 10 ?M TRAP. Although the area under the curve (AUC) of small aggregates (9–25 ?m) induced by 10 ?M TRAP showed no significant correlation with the released HSP27 levels, AUC of medium aggregates (25–50 ?m), large aggregates (50–70 ?m) and light transmittance were significantly correlated with the released HSP27 levels. TRAP-induced phosphorylation of HSP27 was truly suppressed by deguelin, an inhibitor of Akt, in the platelets from a healthy subject. These results strongly suggest that TRAP-induced activation of Akt in addition to p38 MAP kinase positively regulates the release of phosphorylated-HSP27 from human platelets, which is closely related to the platelet hyper-aggregation in type 2 DM patients. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Akt; Diabetes mellitus; HSP27; Platelet; Thrombin-activating protein,"deguelin; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; heat shock protein 27; hemoglobin A1c; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1; platelet derived growth factor AB; protein kinase B; thrombin receptor activating peptide; heat shock protein 27; HSPB1 protein, human; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; oligopeptide; platelet derived growth factor; platelet-derived growth factor AB; protein kinase B; rotenone; thrombin receptor-activating peptide SFLLRNPNDKY; aged; anthropometry; area under the curve; Article; clinical article; comparative study; dose response; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; human cell; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; normal human; protein phosphorylation; thrombocyte aggregation; Western blotting; analogs and derivatives; blood; drug effects; enzyme activation; enzymology; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; phosphorylation; secretion (process); thrombocyte; thrombocyte aggregation; Aged; Area Under Curve; Blood Platelets; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Enzyme Activation; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Female; HSP27 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Male; Oligopeptides; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphorylation; Platelet Aggregation; Platelet-Derived Growth Factor; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Rotenone",2-s2.0-84968765133

We analysed a large database of clinical characteristics of patients with MG and thymic epithelial tumours to elucidate whether the severity of MG affected postoperative survival of those with thymic epithelial neoplasms. METHODS: We conducted a multi-institutional study on the patients who had undergone surgical treatment for thymic epithelial tumours between 1991 and 2010. We examined Masaoka stage, pathological type, serum titre of antiacetylcholine receptor antigen, severity of MG and postoperative prognosis of the patients with or without MG. RESULTS: Of the 2835 registered patients at 32 institutes belonging to the Japanese Association for Research on the Thymus, 2638 were eligible for the study. MG was present in 598 patients (23%). Patients with MG had thymic epithelial tumours with significantly earlier stage (P = 0.0082) and significantly smaller tumours (P = 0.000) than those without. Type A, Type AB thymomas and thymic carcinomas were less frequently observed in patients with MG. Three of 304 patients (1%) with thymic carcinomas had MG preoperatively. Serum titres of antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies were positive in 98% of patients with MG, and 23% of those without. Patients with generalized MG had significantly higher titres of antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies than those with ocular MG (P = 0.000). The postoperative 30-day mortality rate was 0.3%. Postoperative 5- and 10-year survival rates of thymoma patients with MG and those without MG were 94 and 96, and 89 and 89%, respectively. We found no statistical difference in the postoperative survival rate or recurrence-free rate between the two groups. We found no significant statistical differences of these rates by MGFA classification or surgical approach. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that earlier stage, smaller size or Type B thymomas are more frequently associated with MG, and MG may have no impact on the overall survival of patients with thymoma. We suggest that postoperative survival time of the patients with MG and thymic epithelial tumours may be mainly affected by the tumours, not by MG. ?

Methods and Materials The RBE of passive scattering proton beams at the center of the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) was determined from dose-survival curves in 4 cell lines using 6-MV X rays as controls. Survival of 2 cell lines after spot scanning and passive scattering proton irradiation was then compared. Biological effects at the distal end region of the SOBP were also investigated. The OER of passive scattering proton beams and 6 MX X rays were investigated in 2 cell lines. The RBE and OER values were estimated at a 10% cell survival level. The maximum degree of protection of radiation effects by dimethyl sulfoxide was determined to estimate the contribution of the indirect effect against DNA damage. All experiments comparing protons and X rays were made under the same biological conditions. Results The RBE values of passive scattering proton beams in the 4 cell lines examined were 1.01 to 1.22 (average, 1.14) and were almost identical to those of spot scanning beams. Biological effects increased at the distal end of the SOBP. In the 2 cell lines examined, the OER was 2.74 (95% confidence interval, 2.56-2.80) and 3.08 (2.84-3.11), respectively, for X rays, and 2.39 (2.38-2.43) and 2.72 (2.69-2.75), respectively, for protons (P<.05 for both cells between X rays and protons). The maximum degree of protection was significantly higher for X rays than for proton beams (P<.05). Conclusions The RBE values of spot scanning and passive scattering proton beams were almost identical. The OER was lower for protons than for X rays. The lower contribution of the indirect effect may partly account for the lower OER of protons. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",,"Body fluids; Cell culture; Cells; Dimethyl sulfoxide; Monte Carlo methods; Proton beams; Proton irradiation; Radiation effects; Radiation protection; Scanning; Biological conditions; Biological effects; Confidence interval; Indirect effects; Methods and materials; Oxygen enhancement; Relative biological effectiveness; Spread out Bragg peaks; Cytology; dimethyl sulfoxide; DNA; dimethyl sulfide; oxygen; proton; radioprotective agent; sulfide; animal cell; Article; breast cancer cell line; breast sarcoma; cell culture; cell survival; CHO cell line; comparative study; controlled study; DNA damage; female; human; human cell; mouse; nonhuman; oxygen enhancement ratio; passive scattering proton beam; priority journal; proton radiation; proton therapy; proton therapy system; radiation dose; radiation response; radiation scattering; relative biologic effectiveness; salivary gland tumor; spot scanning proton beam; squamous cell carcinoma cell line; X ray; animal; cell line; CFU counting; drug effects; hamster; linear energy transfer; metabolism; photon; radiation response; radiation scattering; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Colony-Forming Units Assay; Cricetinae; DNA Damage; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Humans; Linear Energy Transfer; Mice; Oxygen; Photons; Proton Therapy; Protons; Radiation-Protective Agents; Relative Biological Effectiveness; Scattering, Radiation; Sulfides; X-Rays",2-s2.0-84963625862

Malondialdehyde (MDA) is a major byproduct of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) peroxidation. Increased levels of MDA have been reported in eyes of AMD patients. However, little is known about the direct relationship between MDA and AMD. Here we show the biological importance of MDA in AMD pathogenesis. We first confirmed that MDA levels were significantly increased in eyes of AMD patients. In ARPE-19 cells, a human retinal pigment epithelial cell line, MDA treatment induced vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression alternation, cell junction disruption, and autophagy dysfunction that was also observed in eyes of AMD patients. The MDA-induced VEGF increase was inhibited by autophagy-lysosomal inhibitors. Intravitreal MDA injection in mice increased laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (laser-CNV) volumes. In a mouse model fed a high-linoleic acid diet for 3 months, we found a significant increase in MDA levels, autophagic activity, and laser-CNV volumes. Our study revealed an important role of MDA, which acts not only as a marker but also as a causative factor of AMD pathogenesis-related autophagy dysfunction. Furthermore, higher dietary intake of linoleic acid promoted CNV progression in mice with increased MDA levels. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.

By investigating miRNA expression in serum derived from HBV-infected patients, we have clarified the relationship between miRNA expression and chronic HBV infection. Additionally, we demonstrate the use of miRNAs as both novel biomarkers and new therapies against HBV. We included the sera of 20 patients with chronic HBV infection, sera of 20 patients with HCV infection and sera of 10 healthy controls in this study. The miRNA libraries were sequenced using a 32-mer single end sequence. The validation study of circulating miRNA in serum was conducted by qRT-PCR. The HBV genomic regions of genotype B and genotype C that were speculated to be targeted by miRNA were constructed using complementary oligonucleotides in the vectors. Reporter assays were performed 48 h after transfection. The expression levels of 21 miRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in the three groups. 10 miRNAs (hsa-miR-100-5p, miR-125b-5p, miR-193b-3p, miR-194-3p, miR-30a-3p, miR-30c-2-3p, miR-3591-5p, miR-4709-3p, miR-574-3p and miR-99a-5p) were found to be upregulated in CH-B by deep sequence analysis. The computer analysis showed that two regions of HBsAg are potential targets of miR-125b-5p and miR-30c-2-3p and that these miRNAs may downregulate the expression of HBV-S. The HBV genotype C segment speculated to be targeted by hsa-miR-125b-5p significantly decreased the expression of the reporter. This study indicated that expression of miR-125b-5p was related to the etiology of chronic hepatitis B infection and regulated the expression of HBsAg. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",deep sequencing; hepatitis B virus; luciferase reporter assay; MicroRNAs; MIR-125b-5p,"hepatitis B surface antigen; microRNA; microRNA 100 5p; microRNA 125b 5p; microRNA 193b 3p; microRNA 194 3p; microRNA 30a 3p; microRNA 30c 2 3p; microRNA 3591 5p; microRNA 4709 3p; microRNA 574 3p; microRNA 99a 5p; oligonucleotide; unclassified drug; biological marker; hepatitis B surface antigen; microRNA; MIRN125 microRNA, human; antigen detection; Article; chronic hepatitis B; clinical article; computer analysis; controlled study; down regulation; gene expression; gene expression regulation; gene library; genetic transfection; genomics; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype B; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; human; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reporter gene; serum; biosynthesis; blood; chronic hepatitis B; down regulation; immunology; pathology; upregulation; virology; Biomarkers; Down-Regulation; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; MicroRNAs; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Serum; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-84959270484

They can be classified into the device behavior during and after deployment. While there have been several reports on the latter, information on the former is insufficient. During deployment, the position is maintained by retracting the delivery catheter. We propose that this pulling force be called the traction force and that the magnitude of traction force is termed the traction momentum. The aim of this study was to measure these parameters in order to clarify the properties of SEMSs in terms of their deployment. Material and methods: The traction force, traction momentum, and shortening rate of 10 different SEMSs were measured. Traction force was measured using in-house equipment, and the shortening rate was determined by measuring the stents. Results: The shortening rate was closely related to the stent structure. The traction force varied between 1.5 N and 9.4 N, and the traction momentum was significantly elevated in covered and braided stents. A high traction force did not imply a high traction momentum. Conclusions: A low or constant traction force and a minimal shortening rate significantly facilitated SEMS deployment to optimal positions. Traction force could be an important element for new ideal SEMS design. ?

Methods: We employed a highly sensitive HBsAg (hs-HBsAg) assay (lower detection limit 0.5 mIU/ml), 100 times more sensitive than conventional HBsAg measurements. CHB patients achieving HBsAg seroclearance defined by conventional assays were followed up for serum hs-HBsAg, HBV DNA and antibody to HBsAg (anti-HBs) levels at 0 months, 6-12 months and 3-5 years after HBsAg seroclearance. Factors associated with hs-HBsAg detectability were determined. Results: One hundred and nine patients were recruited; 94 (86.2%) were followed up to years 3-5; and 25 patients (22.9%) were on nucleoside analogue therapy for a median duration of 6.0 (range 1.5-12.7) years before HBsAg seroclearance. Detectable hs-HBsAg was noted in 88 (80.7%), 60 (55.0%) and 20 (21.3%) patients at 0 months, 6-12 months and 3-5 years respectively. At years 3-5, genotype B patients, when compared to genotype C patients, had a higher anti-HBs positive rate (63.2% and 41.1% respectively, P = 0.036). Serum anti-HBs positivity, when compared to persistent anti-HBs negativity, was associated with a lower rate of hs-HBsAg detection (7.4% and 40% respectively, P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed anti-HBs negativity at years 3-5 to be independently associated with persistently positive hs-HBsAg (P = 0.007, odds ratio 7.1, 95% confidence interval 1.7-29.3). Conclusion: Serum hs-HBsAg could detect HBsAg presence in a substantial proportion of CHB after HBsAg seroclearance defined by conventional assays, especially among anti-HBs negative individuals. Serum hs-HBsAg could potentially assist differentiating HBsAg-negative CHB from individuals with only past HBV exposure without carrier state. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",HBV; Anti-HBc; Anti-HBs; HBsAg; Hs-HBsAg,"beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; hepatitis B surface antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; nucleoside analog; virus DNA; antivirus agent; hepatitis B antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; adult; aged; Article; chronic hepatitis B; cohort analysis; esophagus varices; female; follow up; gastrointestinal endoscopy; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype B; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; sensitivity analysis; treatment outcome; blood; chronic hepatitis B; Hong Kong; middle aged; multivariate analysis; statistical model; very elderly; virus load; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; DNA, Viral; Female; Hepatitis B Antibodies; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Hong Kong; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Viral Load; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84949024505

Aims were to (a) identify treatment goals for a new questionnaire on patient needs and benefits in nail psoriasis treatment; (b) analyze the importance of treatment goals in patients with nail psoriasis in general and in defined subgroups; and (c) determine the association between overall treatment goal importance and quality of life. Methods: The study comprised the following steps: qualitative survey on needs and burdens in 120 patients; development of items by an interdisciplinary expert group; item testing in 55 patients in four countries; revision of the questionnaire and assessment in 203 patients in six countries (Germany, Denmark, Italy, Spain, USA, Japan). The percentage of patients rating the goals as ‘quite/very important’ was compared between various patient subgroups. Results: Based on 692 free-text statements, 26 items were developed which were reduced to 24 items after pilot testing. Each of these treatment goals applied to the majority of patients in the multi-center study. Goal importance increased with severity of nail psoriasis, but not with age or disease duration. Manual dexterity and social interaction were of particular importance. Goal importance and quality of life were associated, but not redundant (r?=?0.612, p?<?0.001). Conclusions: Patients with nail psoriasis have manifold and specific treatment goals. Goal importance is a construct different from disease-specific quality of life and should be assessed separately.

Although depression is the leading cause of decrement in health utility in general population, impact of comorbid depression among cancer patients has not been studied sufficiently. Therefore, this study aimed to measure the impact of depression on cancer patients' health utility score, according to the severity of depression. Methods Impact of depression severity (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire) on health utility score (measured by the EuroQoL-5 scale) was evaluated in a sample of 328 Japanese cancer patients, controlling for performance status, symptom burden, and demographic variables. Results The patients with depression had significantly lower health utility value than those without depression (mean decrement = 0.14). Decrements in health utility of 0.13, 0.18, and 0.19 were observed for mild, moderate, and moderately severe to severe level of depression, respectively. The difference was significant between groups. Depression severity was a significant predictor for health utility (standardized coefficient beta = -0.25), which was comparable with physical symptom burden and performance status. Participants' age, gender, cancer stage, and comorbid illness were not significant. The model explained 37.9% of the variance. Conclusions Even mild level of depression caused clinically meaningful decrement in health utility value in cancer patients, which was comparable with decrements due to major physical complications of cancer. Influence of depression should be carefully investigated when interpreting the quality-adjusted life year among cancer patients.

Most left ventricles with relatively lower LVEF did not have IS. Accordingly, lack of IS may correlate with LV diastolic dysfunction through the loss of LV elastic recoil and may contribute to the pathogenesis of heart failure (HF) and reduced survival. We enrolled 144 consecutive patients that underwent cardiac catheterization for the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was obtained from left ventriculography. The IS was calculated from the LV pressure (P)?dP/dt relation. The study endpoint of this retrospective outcome-observational study was combined subsequent acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) and all-cause mortality. During the follow-up period (median 6.1?years), seven unscheduled hospitalizations for ADHF and nine all-cause deaths were observed. The event-free survival rate was significantly higher among patients with IS than among patients without IS (log-rank, p?=?0.001). On a multivariate Cox regression analysis, lack of IS was a prime predictor of the endpoint during follow-up (hazard ratio: 6.98; 95?% confidence interval: 1.48–33.03; p?=?0.01). An LVEF???58?% was a surrogate indicator for the presence of IS, and patients with LVEF???58?% had fewer incidences of the endpoint than patients with LVEF?<?58?%. In conclusion, lack of IS or LVEF?<?58?% should be a predictor of future ADHF and all-cause mortality. ? 2015, The Author(s).",Aortic blood flow; Diastolic dysfunction; Ejection fraction; Heart failure; Inertia stress,"acute heart failure; aged; area under the curve; Article; cardiovascular parameters; cause of death; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease association; disease marker; event free survival; female; follow up; heart catheterization; heart death; heart left ventricle dP-dt; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart ventriculography; hospital admission; hospitalization; human; incidence; inertia stress; major clinical study; male; mortality; observational study; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; survival rate; chi square distribution; Coronary Disease; disease free survival; epidemiology; heart failure; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle pressure; Japan; Kaplan Meier method; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; proportional hazards model; risk factor; time factor; Aged; Cardiac Catheterization; Cause of Death; Chi-Square Distribution; Coronary Disease; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Heart Failure; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Patient Admission; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Stroke Volume; Time Factors; Ventricular Dysfunction, Left; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Pressure",2-s2.0-84924690107

Methods: We conducted an open-label, randomized controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of leuprorelin subcutaneously administered every-3-months for 2 versus 3 or more, up to 5?years, together with daily tamoxifen for 5?years in premenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer patients. Primary endpoints were disease-free survival (DFS) and safety. Results: Eligible patients (N?=?222) were randomly assigned to receive leuprorelin for either 2?years (N?=?112) or 3 or more years (N?=?110) with tamoxifen for 5?years after surgery. Leuprorelin treatment for 3 or more years provided no significant difference in DFS rate over 2?years: 94.1 versus 91.8?% at 144?weeks (3?years) after the second year (week 96) and 90.8 versus 90.4?% at the fifth year (week 240). The overall survival rate was 100?% for both groups during the third through fifth year study period. There were no significant differences in the incidence of adverse events (AEs) between the 2 groups: most AEs were rated grade 1 or 2. Conclusions: Adjuvant leuprorelin treatment for 3 or more years with tamoxifen showed a survival benefit and safety profile similar to that for 2?years in premenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer patients. No new safety signal was identified for long-term leuprorelin treatment. Longer follow-up observation is needed to determine the optimal duration of leuprorelin treatment. ? 2015, The Author(s).",Adjuvant endocrine therapy; Disease-free survival (DFS); Leuprorelin acetate; Premenopausal endocrine-responsive breast cancer; Safety,"leuprorelin; tamoxifen; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; estradiol; leuprorelin; tamoxifen; adult; arthralgia; Article; bone density; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer survival; controlled study; disease free survival; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; estradiol blood level; fatty liver; female; headache; hot flush; human; hyperhidrosis; insomnia; major clinical study; metrorrhagia; musculoskeletal stiffness; overall survival; pilot study; premenopause; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; survival rate; survival time; treatment duration; adjuvant chemotherapy; blood; Breast Neoplasms; clinical trial; drug effects; middle aged; mortality; multicenter study; premenopause; procedures; treatment outcome; Adult; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Bone Density; Breast Neoplasms; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Disease-Free Survival; Estradiol; Female; Humans; Leuprolide; Middle Aged; Premenopause; Survival Rate; Tamoxifen; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84922455912

Materials and Methods: We confined the analysis to 24 areas available of cancer incidence information, excluding women with a previous diagnosis of BC. Baseline data were collected from 38,610 (9,367 premenopausal, and 29,243 postmenopausal) women during 1988 and 1990. The study subjects were followed-up at the end of 2009, and 273 (84 premenopausal, and 189 postmenopausal) cases of BC were newly diagnosed in 501,907 person-years. The Cox model was used to estimate a hazards ratio (HR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) of BC risk. Results: As a result of the multivariate analysis adjusting for age at baseline survey, age at menarche, number of live births, and, age at first delivery, weight gain since age 20 of 6.7 kg-9.9 kg, and ?10.0 kg were significantly associated with increased risk for postmenopausal BC (HR=2.48, 95% CI 1.40-4.41, and, HR=2.94, 95% CI 1.84-4.70, respectively). Significantly increased trend of BC risk was also observed in weight gain since age 20 (p for trend, p < 0.001). Amount of ethanol intake per day?15.0 g was significantly associated with increased risk for postmenopausal BC in the multivariable-adjusted analysis (HR=2.74, 95% CI 1.32-5.70). Conclusions: Higher weight gain in adulthood and larger amounts of ethanol intake were significantly associated with increased risk of BC in Japanese postmenopausal women.

However, these trials enrolled very few Asian patients. Methods: This phase 2 study investigated pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone in 36 Japanese patients with RRMM after ?2 prior therapies. Results: Patients enrolled in the study had a relatively high disease burden (81 % Durie-Salmon stage II or III) and were heavily pretreated (median, 6.5 prior antimyeloma regimens). The overall response rate was 42 % (1 patient with complete response and 14 with partial response), with an additional 44 % (16 patients) achieving stable disease (SD). Response rates in patients aged ?65 years and >65 years were 47 and 35 %, respectively. None of the five patients with extramedullary disease achieved a response, with three of them maintaining SD of short duration. Median progression-free survival was 10.1 months after a 7.7-month median follow-up, and the median overall survival was not reached. The most frequent grade ?3 adverse events (AEs) were neutropenia (64 %), anemia (42 %), and thrombocytopenia (31 %). The most frequent nonhematologic grade ?3 AEs were pneumonia and decreased appetite (8 % each). Adverse events in patients aged >65 years were similar to those in patients aged ?65 years, except for a higher rate of grade ?3 pneumonia. Conclusions: Collectively, the results of this study demonstrate that pomalidomide plus low-dose dexamethasone is an effective and safe treatment for Japanese patients with RRMM, although careful attention needs to be paid to serious infections.

Although its neuropathology is well understood, the cellular and molecular mechanisms are yet to be elucidated due to limitations in the currently available human genetic data. In this study, we generated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from two familial ALS (FALS) patients with a missense mutation in the fused-in sarcoma (FUS) gene carrying the heterozygous FUS H517D mutation, and isogenic iPSCs with the homozygous FUS H517D mutation by genome editing technology. These cell-derived motor neurons mimicked several neurodegenerative phenotypes including mis-localization of FUS into cytosolic and stress granules under stress conditions, and cellular vulnerability. Moreover, exon array analysis using motor neuron precursor cells (MPCs) combined with CLIP-seq datasets revealed aberrant gene expression and/or splicing pattern in FALS MPCs. These results suggest that iPSC-derived motor neurons are a useful tool for analyzing the pathogenesis of human motor neuron disorders. ? 2016 The Authors.",,"fused in sarcoma protein; FUS protein, human; RNA binding protein FUS; adult; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Article; cell lineage; controlled study; cytosol; exon; familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; gene expression; gene technology; genetic association; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; male; missense mutation; motoneuron; motor neuron precursor cell; pluripotent stem cell; priority journal; RNA splicing; wild type; young adult; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; biological model; cell culture; cell differentiation; family health; female; fluorescence microscopy; gene editing; gene expression profiling; genetics; heterozygote; homozygote; induced pluripotent stem cell; metabolism; missense mutation; nucleotide sequence; pathology; pedigree; procedures; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Adult; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Base Sequence; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Cytosol; Family Health; Female; Gene Editing; Gene Expression Profiling; Heterozygote; Homozygote; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Male; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Models, Genetic; Motor Neurons; Mutation, Missense; Pedigree; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA-Binding Protein FUS; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84961226024

The peripheral blood smear showed loss of central pallor, with numerous spherocytes. Multiplex PCR only detected expression of the cpa gene, indicating that the pathogen was C. perfringens type A. Conclusions: C. perfringens infection should be considered in a febrile patient who has severe hemolytic anemia with a very low MCV, hemolyzed blood sample, and negative Coombs test.

This produces considerable morbidity due to skeletal-related events, SREs, including bone pain, hypercalcemia, pathologic fracture, and compression of the spinal cord. The mechanism of bone metastasis is complex and involves cooperative reciprocal interaction among tumor cells, osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and the mineralized bone matrix. The interaction between the metastatic tumor and bone stromal cells has been commonly referred to as the ""vicious cycle"". Tumor cells stimulate osteoblasts, which in turn stimulate osteoclasts through the secretion of cytokines such as the TNF family member receptor activator of nuclear κB ligand (RANKL). Activated osteoclasts degrade the bone matrix by producing strong acid and proteinases. Bone degradation by osteoclasts releases TGFβ and other growth factors stored in the bone matrix, that further stimulate tumor cells. Bone modifying agents, targeting osteoclast activity, such as bisphosphonate and RANKL antibodies are considered as the standard of care for reducing SREs of patients with bone metastatic diseases. These agents decrease osteoclast activity and delay worsening of skeletal pain and aggravation of bone metastatic diseases. While the management of SREs by these agents may improve patients' lives, this treatment does not address the specific issues of the patients with bone metastasis such as tumor dormancy, drug resistance, or improvement of survival. Here, we review the mechanisms of bone metastasis formation, tumor heterogeneity in the bone microenvironment, and conventional therapy for bone metastatic diseases and discuss the potential development of new therapies targeting tumor heterogeneity in the bone microenvironment. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Bone metastasis; Bone microenvironment; Breast cancer; Metastatic cascade prostate cancer; Tumor stromal interaction,Cells; Cytology; Disease control; Diseases; Drug therapy; Osteoblasts; Pathology; Patient treatment; Tumors; Urology; Bone metastasis; Breast Cancer; Metastatic disease; Microenvironments; Osteoclast activity; Prostate cancers; Therapeutic targets; Tumor heterogeneity; Bone; osteoclast differentiation factor; transforming growth factor beta; binding affinity; bone defect; bone metastasis; breast cancer; cancer cell; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; cell proliferation; cell self-renewal; cytokine release; growth inhibition; hematopoietic stem cell; human; nonhuman; osteoblast; osteoclast; osteolysis; phenotype; priority journal; prostate cancer; protein binding; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; quality of life; Review; tumor invasion; tumor microenvironment; upregulation; animal; bone; bone tumor; breast tumor; female; male; pathology; physiology; prostate tumor; tumor microenvironment; Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Neoplasms; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Prostatic Neoplasms; Tumor Microenvironment,2-s2.0-84977911795

Study design We recruited Japanese subjects with NIIC who had no definitive molecular genetic diagnosis. We developed a diagnostic custom panel of 18 genes, and the amplicon library was sequenced via NGS. We then compared clinical data between the molecular genetically confirmed subjects with NIIC. Results We analyzed 109 patients with NIIC (""genetic cholestasis,"" 31 subjects; ""unknown with complications"" such as prematurity, 46 subjects; ""unknown without complications,"" 32 subjects), and a molecular genetic diagnosis was made for 28 subjects (26%). The rate of positive molecular genetic diagnosis in each category was 22 of 31 (71%) for the ""genetic cholestasis"" group, 2 of 46 (4.3%) for the ""unknown with complications"" group, and 4 of 32 (12.5%) for the ""unknown without complications"" group. The grouping of the molecular diagnoses in the group with genetic cholestasis was as follows: 12 with Alagille syndrome, 5 with neonatal Dubin-Johnson syndrome, 5 with neonatal intrahepatic cholestasis caused by citrin deficiency, and 6 with progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis or benign recurrent intrahepatic cholestasis with low gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase levels. Several clinical datasets, including age of onset, direct bilirubin, and aminotransferases, were significantly different between the disorders confirmed using molecular genetic diagnosis.

Materials and methods: Between July 2013 and April 2015, 78 pediatric patients with CHD (median age 4?months) were examined using DSCT with the Flash Spiral Cardio mode. The types of ventricular abnormalities were ventricular septal defect (VSD) in 42 (the malaligned type in 11, perimembranous type in 23, supracristal type in 2, atrioventricular type in 2, and muscular type in 4), single ventricle (SV) in 11, and congenital corrected transposition of the great arteries (ccTGA) in 4. We evaluated the accuracy of the diagnosis of the VSD type. In cases of SV and ccTGA, we assessed the detectability of the anatomical features of both ventricles for a diagnosis of ventricular situs. Results: DSCT confirmed the diagnoses for all VSDs. The type of defect was precisely diagnosed for all patients. The anatomical features of both ventricles were also depicted and ventricular situs of SV and ccTGA was correctly diagnosed.

L-OHP frequently causes acute peripheral neuropathies. These adverse effects limit cancer therapy with L-OHP. The present study was designed to reveal the changes in sensory nerve function in L-OHP-injected rats. Mechanical static allodynia, dynamic allodynia, and cold allodynia were evaluated using the von Frey test, brush test, and acetone test, respectively. Sensory nerve fiber responsiveness was measured using a Neurometer. The fifth lumbar ventral root was sectioned to record multi-unit efferent discharges. Single intraperitoneal administration of L-OHP induced mechanical static allodynia, dynamic allodynia, and cold allodynia in Wistar/ST rats. The thresholds for paw withdrawal induced by 2000 Hz (Aβ-fiber) and 5 Hz (C-fiber), but not 250 Hz (Aδ-fiber) sine-wave electrical stimulation were reduced in L-OHP-treated rats. Multi-unit efferent discharges were increased by mechanical stimulation using a von Frey filament applied to the plantar surface of the hindpaw. The discharges during and after stimulation were increased in the L-OHP-treated rats. Cold stimulation, but not brush stimulation, increased the discharges in L-OHP-treated rats. These results suggest that sensitization of Aβ- and C-fibers, but not Aδ-fibers, contributes to the development of L-OHP-induced mechanical and cold allodynia. ? 2015 The Authors.",Efferent discharge; Neurometer; Neuropathic pain; Oxaliplatin (L-OHP); Sensory nerve,"oxaliplatin; antineoplastic agent; oxaliplatin; platinum complex; acetone test; allodynia; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cold allodynia; controlled study; dynamic allodynia; electrostimulation; lumbar spinal cord; male; mechanical static allodynia; mechanical stimulation; nerve cell membrane potential; nonhuman; pain threshold; rat; sensory nerve; single drug dose; ventral root; von Frey test; animal; chemically induced; dose response; drug effects; hyperalgesia; nerve fiber; nociception; pathophysiology; peripheral neuropathy; physical stimulation; physiology; sensory nerve cell; spinal cord; Wistar rat; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Electric Stimulation; Hyperalgesia; Male; Nerve Fibers; Nociception; Organoplatinum Compounds; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Physical Stimulation; Rats, Wistar; Sensory Receptor Cells; Spinal Cord",2-s2.0-84954349518

IBUKI was a phase III, non-randomized, open-label study of the efficacy and safety of inhaled iloprost in Japanese patients with PAH. Methods and Results: Adults with PAH who were treatment-naive or administered endothelin receptor antagonists (ERAs) and/or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (PDE5-Is) and in NYHA/WHO functional class (FC) III/IV had inhaled iloprost (2.5 ?ug, increased to 5.0 ?ug if tolerated) 6-9 times daily for 12 weeks. Eligible patients entered a 40-week extension phase. Endpoints included change from baseline to week 12 in pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; primary endpoint), other efficacy parameters, and safety. Data were compared with new subgroup analyses of treatment-na?ve Western PAH patients from the global phase III AIR study. 27 patients received iloprost: 89% were treated with an ERA and/or PDE5-I; 70% with both. At week 12, PVR improved from baseline by -124 dyn sec cm-5 (95% CI, -177 to -72) and 6-min walking distance increased by 36.0 m (95% CI, 14.9 to 57.1). NYHA/WHO FC improved in 62%; none worsened. Common drug-related adverse events were headache (37%) and cough (15%); 1 patient experienced hypotension; none reported syncope or hemoptysis. There were no deaths and no unexpected long-term safety findings. AIR PAH subgroup analyses showed similar results. Conclusions: Inhaled iloprost appeared effective and safe in Japanese PAH patients, including ERA- and PDE5-I-treated patients, consistent with findings of the AIR PAH subpopulation and previous iloprost studies. ? 2016, Japanese Circulation Society.

To determine the prevalence and distribution of signs of synovitis in the residual joints in remission defined by the American College of Rheumatology/European League Against Rheumatism (ACR/EULAR) rheumatoid arthritis (RA) remission criteria and the role of their components in preventing misclassification due to reduced joint count. Methods. The cross-sectional observational data of RA patients including full joint counts were analyzed. Definitions of remission used were the ACR/EULAR RA remission criteria and their modifications using full joint counts with the same thresholds of the items and the calculated results. Results. A total of 304 RA patients with 3,149 observations could be analyzed. Patients in remission according to the ACR/EULAR remission criteria can still show residual disease activity in the feet in up to 27% of the population with a 28-joint count remission. Residual disease activity has no impact on patient's global assessment for current disease activity, when signs of concomitant ankle joint synovitis were absent. Conclusions. RA patients in remission according to the ACR/EULAR definitions can still show signs of synovitis mostly in the forefeet joints.

To describe the process of collecting and evaluating evidence for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for developing clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for rheumatologists in Japan. Methods. The task force comprised rheumatologists, epidemiologists, health economists, and patients. First, the critical outcomes were determined according to a three-round Delphi method, and eight topics with 88 clinical questions (CQs) were formulated. A systematic review of CQs was conducted using the Cochran Database of Systematic Reviews, MEDLINE, and Japana Centra Revvo Medicina (2003-2012). A questionnaire survey and focus group interview were performed to capture the patients' values and preferences. Data from the National Health Insurance drug price list and product information provided by pharmaceutical companies were collected to evaluate drug cost and safety. The GRADE approach was used to describe the evidence quality and determine the strength of recommendations. Recommendations were developed using a modified Delphi method by a multidisciplinary panel including patients. Results. Eight meetings and frequent e-mail communications were conducted to draft a quality assessment of evidence and recommendations. For 88 CQs, recommendation statements were determined. Conclusions. Using the GRADE approach, new CPGs successfully addressed important clinical issues for treating RA patients.

Previously, we demonstrated that expression and function of calcium sensing receptors (CaSR) in PASMC from patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and animals with experimental pulmonary hypertension (PH) were greater than in PASMC from normal subjects and control animals. However, the mechanisms by which CaSR triggers Ca2+ influx in PASMC and the implication of CaSR in the development of PH remain elusive. Here, we report that CaSR functionally interacts with TRPC6 to regulate [Ca2+]cyt in PASMC. Downregulation of CaSR or TRPC6 with siRNA inhibited Ca2+-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase in IPAH-PASMC (in which CaSR is upregulated), whereas overexpression of CaSR or TRPC6 enhanced Ca2+-induced [Ca2+]cyt increase in normal PASMC (in which CaSR expression level is low). The upregulated CaSR in IPAH-PASMC was also associated with enhanced Akt phosphorylation, whereas blockade of CaSR in IPAH-PASMC attenuated cell proliferation. In in vivo experiments, deletion of the CaSR gene in mice (casr-/-) significantly inhibited the development and progression of experimental PH and markedly attenuated acute hypoxiainduced pulmonary vasoconstriction. These data indicate that functional interaction of upregulated CaSR and upregulated TRPC6 in PASMC from IPAH patients and animals with experimental PH may play an important role in the development and progression of sustained pulmonary vasoconstriction and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Blockade or downregulation of CaSR and/or TRPC6 with siRNA or miRNA may be a novel therapeutic strategy to develop new drugs for patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. ? 2016, American Physiological Society.

A universal severity classification system has not yet been adopted for IPF. Objective: The purpose of this study was to test the correlation between quantitative-CT indices and lung physiology variables and to determine the ability of such indices to predict disease severity in IPF. Methods: A total of 27 IPF patients showing radiological UIP pattern on high-resolution (HR) CT were retrospectively enrolled. Staging of IPF was performed according to two classification systems: the Japanese and GAP (gender, age, and physiology) staging systems. CT images were assessed using a commercially available CT imaging analysis workstation, and the whole-lung mean CT value (MCT), the normally attenuated lung volume as defined from -950 HU to -701 Hounsfield unit (NL), the volume of the whole lung (WL), and the percentage of NL to WL (NL%), were calculated. Results: CT indices (MCT, WL, and NL) closely correlated with lung physiology variables. Among them, NL strongly correlated with forced vital capacity (FVC) (r = 0.92, P <0.0001). NL% showed a large area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for detecting patients in the moderate or advanced stages of IPF. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that NL% is significantly more useful than the percentages of predicted FVC and predicted diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Japanese stage II/III/IV [odds ratio, 0.73; 95% confidence intervals (CI), 0.48 to 0.92; P < 0.01]; III/IV [odds ratio. 0.80; 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96; P < 0.01]; GAP stage II/III [odds ratio, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.97; P < 0.05]). Conclusion: The measurement of NL% by threshold-based volumetric CT analysis may help improve IPF staging. ? 2016 Ohkubo et al.

We have employed partial-brain radiotherapy (PBRT) with wide margins for PCNSL patients with a single lesion or a few lesions. In this study, we evaluated the treatment outcome in PCNSL patients undergoing PBRT. Between 2003 and 2014, 24 patients were treated with PBRT; 16 received high-dose-methotrexate (MTX) -containing chemotherapy before PBRT. Conventional fractionation with a median dose of 54 Gy was used. For reference, 15 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT were also analyzed. The 3-year overall survival rate was 60% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 68% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy plus PBRT. The 3-year progression-free survival rate was 41% for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT and 36% for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. The in-field recurrence rate was 26% and the out-of-field recurrence rate was 15% at 3 years for all 24 patients undergoing PBRT. The rates for in-field recurrence and the out-of-field recurrence were 27% and 21%, respectively, for the 16 patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy. CNS-recurrence rates were similar in patients undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and PBRT to the rates in those undergoing MTX-based chemotherapy and WBRT. Neurocognitive dysfunction developed in 3 of the 16 patients undergoing MTX + PBRT and in 4 of 15 patients undergoing MTX + WBRT (P = 0.68). PBRT seems to be a feasible treatment option for solitary PCNSL. Further investigations are warranted to evaluate the advantages of PBRT over WBRT. ? 2015 The Author 2015.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognostic impact of clinicopathological variables and perioperative therapy for surgically treated thymic carcinoma using a nationwide database. METHODS: Of 2835 patients with surgically treated thymic epithelial tumours collected from 32 Japanese institutions, a total of 306 patients with thymic carcinomas, excluding neuroendocrine tumours, were enrolled in this retrospective study. Multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed for overall (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) after R0 resection. RESULTS: Of 306 patients, 228 (75%) patients presented with Masaoka stage III-IV. Squamous cell carcinoma was the most common histological type (n = 216, 71%). R0 resection was performed in 181 (61%) patients, R1 in 46 (16%), R2 sub-total (? 80% tumour resection) in 43 (14%) and R2 non-resection in 27 (9%). The 5-year OS rate was 61%. Prognostic factors for OS were Masaoka stage and resection status. R0 resection was associated with most improved OS; however, both R1 and R2 sub-total resection resulted in superior OS compared with R2 non-resection [hazard ratio (95% confidence interval) for R0, R1 and R2 sub-total, 0.27 (0.15-0.48), 0.40 (0.22-0.74) and 0.38 (0.20-0.72), respectively]. Histological type and perioperative therapy did not affect OS, whereas tumour size and postoperative radiotherapy were associated with improved RFS after R0 resection. CONCLUSIONS: R0 resection is essential for prolonged OS for surgically treated thymic carcinoma, but maximal debulking surgery might be beneficial and worth evaluating for advanced disease deemed difficult for R0 resection.

Methods: A total of 20,360 subjects of the Japan Public Health Center (JPHC)-based prospective study cohort II with available data on HBV and HCV infection status from blood samples were followed up until the end of 2010 for an average of 16 years. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to calculate HRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: During 324,394 person-years, 116 newly diagnosed cases of pancreatic cancer were identified. Compared with individuals without a positive infection marker, the multivariate-adjusted HRs were 1.22 (95% CI, 0.81-1.84) for anti-HBc and 0.69 (95% CI, 0.28-1.69) for anti-HCV. There were no pancreatic cancer cases among HBsAg-positive participants. Conclusion: In the JPHC study, we did not observe a statistically significant association between hepatitis B or C and the risk of pancreatic cancer. Impact: Our results do not support an association between hepatitis B or C and the risk of pancreatic cancer.

The quake generated a tsunami that crashed ashore. The first tsunami of 15 m reached the shoreline 40 min after the quake. Approximately 16,000 people were lost, and more than 2000 remain missing.The National Police Agency took command of disaster victim identification (DVI). The Japanese Society of Legal Medicine sent member forensic pathologists and odontologists to more than 30 temporary mortuaries.No radiological technique other than dental X-ray was used for DVI. More than 90% of the victims were estimated to have died as a result of drowning from the tsunami. Approximately 90% of the victims were visually identified. Others were identified by dental records, fingerprints, or DNA. There were cases of misidentification resulting from visual identification.No CT scanning was undertaken throughout the DVI operation. The reasons that CT imaging was not used included the following: 1) there were too many bodies to scan, thus, it would have been too time/cost-consuming, 2) DVI was undertaken at many sites over a large area, 3) there was limited local experience with imaging techniques for DVI, and 4) most bodies were not injured or decomposed so were able to be visually identified. This was assisted by the cool winter weather at the time of the disaster.Four years after the tsunami, 15,736/15,892 (99%) bodies have been identified, and 2573 people are still missing. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",DVI; Earthquake; Japanese tsunami 2011; Radiology,Article; autopsy; disaster victim; disaster victim identification; DNA determination; drowning; finger dermatoglyphics; forensic identification; forensic pathology; forensic science; human; Japan; medical record; odontology; priority journal; radiological procedures; tsunami; winter; X ray,2-s2.0-84961120109

Anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody, ipilimumab, is the first-approved immune checkpoint inhibitor and has shown durable objective responses for advanced melanoma beyond the effect of dacarbazine. Anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies, nivolumab and pembrolizumab, are other immune checkpoint inhibitors that have demonstrated more effective results than conventional drugs in clinical trials for a variety of advanced solid tumors including melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma and renal carcinoma. These studies have indicated that the enhancement of anti-cancer immunity by controlling the immune suppressive environment in cancer tissues is an important issue for the development of cancer immune-therapy. Accordingly, in recent years, the enthusiasm for research of cancer immunology has shifted to studies regarding the formation of the immune suppressive environment, immune suppression mechanisms in cancer tissues and the molecules and cells involved in these pathways. Novel findings from these studies might lead to the development of cancer immunotherapy based on control of the immune suppressive environment. ?

Therefore, glucose and caloric balances become negative, making the blood glucose level as well as insulin secretion both reduced. On the other hand, the proximal tubular fluid, constituting with low chloride concentration because of SGLT2 inhibition, is transferred to the loop of Henle. On the low chloride conditions, the reabsorption mechanisms in the loop of Henle do not work, as if loop diuretics are given. Finally, blood pressure is also lowered secondarily due to the loop diuretic action by SGLT2 inhibitions. Thus, the metabolic and hemodynamic combined systems synergistically interact further to suppress the risks leading to atherosclerosis and organs damage. Precise mechanisms for SGLT2 inhibitors to work in various aspects especially in preventing organ damage and cardiovascular events must be clarified further. ? 2016 American Society of Hypertension.

The present study sought to determine whether Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) symptoms reported during everyday life were related to reduced HRV. Methodology: Eighty-three young adults with PTSD underwent 24-hour Holter monitoring, during which PTSD symptoms were measured using ecological momentary assessment (EMA). Multilevel modeling was used to examine the association between PTSD symptom severity and low frequency (LF) and high frequency (HF) HRV. Results: PTSD symptoms were associated with reductions in LF HRV, independently of age and activity level. There was no significant association between PTSD symptom levels and HF HRV. Conclusions: These results indicate that an association between momentary PTSD symptom severity and reduced LF HRV is significant and observable in young adults with PTSD. Findings highlight the need for cardiovascular screening in young adults with PTSD and early interventions that target physiological reactivity in PTSD. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Heart rate variability; Posttraumatic stress disorder,"adult; age; Article; disease association; disease severity; female; heart rate variability; Holter monitoring; human; major clinical study; male; posttraumatic stress disorder; association; heart rate; pathophysiology; posttraumatic stress disorder; severity of illness index; young adult; Adult; Cues; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Severity of Illness Index; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84959378343

Safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of carfilzomib were examined in phase 1. The primary endpoint in phase 2 was the overall response rate (ORR). Carfilzomib was administered in a twice-weekly, consecutive-day dosing schedule. In Phase 1, doses of 15 or 20 mg/m2 were administered on this schedule or 20 mg/m2 on Days 1 and 2 of Cycle 1 and then 27 mg/m2 in the 20/27 mg/m2 cohort. Patients had a median of five prior therapies, including bortezomib and an immunomodulatory agent. The dose level did not reach the maximum tolerated dose. The most common adverse events were haematological. Notably, carfilzomib either induced new hypertension (n = 4) or aggravated previously existing hypertension (n = 6) in 10 of 50 patients. Four of the eight patients who previously experienced peripheral neuropathy (PN) experienced a recurrence with carfilzomib use, but no new cases of PN occurred. The ORR of the 20/27 mg/m2 40 patient cohort was similar to that in the pivotal US study. The dose was efficacious and tolerable in heavily pre-treated Japanese patients; however, meticulous control of hypertension may be necessary for further carfilzomib use. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Cardiovascular AEs; Carfilzomib; Hypertension peripheral neuropathy; Multiple myeloma,"carfilzomib; antineoplastic agent; carfilzomib; oligopeptide; adult; aged; Article; bronchopneumonia; cancer recurrence; cancer resistance; cardiomyopathy; congestive heart failure; drug blood level; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; dyspnea; enteritis; female; first degree atrioventricular block; gingivitis; heart palpitation; herpes virus infection; hot flush; human; hypertension; influenza; lip disease; male; multicenter study; multiple myeloma; oropharynx candidiasis; orthostatic hypotension; pharmacodynamics; pharyngitis; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; pneumonia; priority journal; rhinopharyngitis; Staphylococcus infection; upper respiratory tract infection; vasculitis; virus pneumonia; blood; cancer staging; cardiovascular disease; chemically induced; clinical trial; dose response; drug administration; middle aged; multiple myeloma; pathology; peripheral neuropathy; recurrent disease; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Neoplasm Staging; Oligopeptides; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Recurrence",2-s2.0-84958932467

To prevent the emergence of escaped mutant virus, we mixed three HBV-siRNAs (HBV-siRNAmix); the mixture was encapsulated in a novel pH-sensitive multifunctional envelope-type nanodevice (MEND), a hepatocyte-specific drug delivery system. Coagulation factor 7 siRNA was used to assess delivery and knockdown efficiencies of MEND/siRNA treatments in mice. The potency of MEND/HBV-siRNAmix was evaluated in primary human hepatocytes and in chimeric mice with humanized liver persistently infected with HBV. Results Effective knockdown of targets, efficient delivery of siRNA, and liver-specific delivery were each observed with MEND. MEND/HBV-siRNA caused efficient reduction of HBsAg and HBeAg in vitro and in vivo. However, ETV treatment did not efficiently reduce HBsAg or HBeAg when compared with a single MEND/HBV-siRNAmix treatment. Furthermore, the suppressive effects of a single dose of MEND/HBV-siRNAmix persisted for 14 days in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion We demonstrated that MEND/HBV-siRNA controlled HBV more efficiently than did ETV. Furthermore, the effect of a single dose of MEND/HBV-siRNA persisted for a long time. These results indicated that MEND/HBV-siRNA may be a promising novel HBV treatment that is more effective than reverse transcriptase inhibitors. ? 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.",Chronic HBV infection; pH-sensitive multifunctional envelope-type nanodevice; RNAi therapy,"blood clotting factor 7; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; small interfering RNA; virus protein; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; liposome; small interfering RNA; virus DNA; animal model; Article; consensus sequence; controlled study; down regulation; drug delivery system; drug distribution; drug targeting; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; human cell; liver cell; mouse; multifunctional envelope type nanodevice; nanodevice; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; single drug dose; animal; gene transfer; genetics; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; pH; Animals; DNA, Viral; Gene Transfer Techniques; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Liposomes; Mice; RNA, Small Interfering",2-s2.0-84958912968

Various viral, host, and environmental factors influence the natural history of HBV infection. Recent genome-wide association studies identified several host genetic factors influencing the clinical course of HBV infection. Genetic variations in HLA class II loci were significantly associated with susceptibility to persistent HBV infection. Other polymorphisms in or near the genes EHMT2, TCF19, and HLA-C, located near HLA class II loci, and UBE2L3 were also associated with persistent HBV infection. Meanwhile, polymorphisms in KIF1B, GRIK1, and STAT4 were associated with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Interestingly, HLA class II genetic variations were strongly associated with not only persistent HBV infection, but also disease progression and HBV-related HCC in chronic hepatitis B. Understanding the various genetic factors associated with the clinical course of HBV infection is essential for personalized treatment and surveillance of disease progression and HCC. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Fibrosis; GWAS; HBV; HCC; HLA,"hepatitis B vaccine; HLA C antigen; antibody titer; Article; clinical feature; disease course; disease surveillance; EHMT2 gene; ethnicity; gene; gene locus; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; genotype; GRIK1 gene; haplotype; hepatitis B; HLA C gene; human; intron; Japanese (people); KIF1B gene; liver carcinogenesis; nonhuman; single nucleotide polymorphism; STAT4 gene; TCF19 gene; UBE2L3 gene; ubiquitination; virus cell interaction; case control study; chronic hepatitis B; genetic predisposition; genetic variation; genetics; Hepatitis B virus; immunology; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; pathophysiology; virology; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Case-Control Studies; Disease Progression; Genes, MHC Class II; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; HLA-C Antigens; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-84955170769

Logistic regression analysis performed with the endpoint of having CAD revealed that the PPP/WB serotonin ratio was independently associated with CAD (odds ratio 3.37, 95% confidence interval 1.04-10.9, P = 0.04). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to discriminate subjects with CAD from those without CAD indicated that combining PPP/WB serotonin ratio and d-ROM improved diagnostic utility.

LSD1 interacts physically with SNAIL1, a member of the SNAIL/SCRATCH family of transcription factors. This study describes the discovery of SNAIL1 peptide-based inactivators of LSD1. We designed and prepared SNAIL1 peptides bearing a propargyl amine, hydrazine, or phenylcyclopropane moiety. Among them, peptide 3, bearing hydrazine, displayed the most potent LSD1-inhibitory activity in enzyme assays. Kinetic study and mass spectrometric analysis indicated that peptide 3 is a mechanism-based LSD1 inhibitor. Furthermore, peptides 37 and 38, which consist of cell-membrane-permeable oligoarginine conjugated with peptide 3, induced a dose-dependent increase of dimethylated Lys4 of histone H3 in HeLa cells, suggesting that they are likely to exhibit LSD1-inhibitory activity intracellularly. In addition, peptide 37 decreased the viability of HeLa cells. We believe this new approach for targeting LSD1 provides a basis for development of potent selective inhibitors and biological probes for LSD1. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"amine; antineoplastic agent; cyclopropane derivative; diphenylcyclopropane; enzyme inhibitor; functional group; histone H3; hydrazine; lysine specific demethylase 1; lysine specific demethylase 1 selective inactivator; oligoarginine conjugated peptide; peptide derivative; protein; protein SNAIL1; unclassified drug; enzyme inhibitor; histone demethylase; KDM1A protein, human; peptide; snail family transcription factors; transcription factor; antiproliferative activity; Article; cell membrane permeability; cell viability; concentration response; controlled study; crystal structure; drug design; drug effect; drug mechanism; drug potency; drug screening; drug structure; drug synthesis; drug targeting; enzyme activity; enzyme inactivation; enzyme kinetic assay; HeLa cell line; histone methylation; human; human cell; mass spectrometry; amino acid sequence; antagonists and inhibitors; cell survival; chemistry; drug effects; metabolism; molecular docking; Amino Acid Sequence; Cell Survival; Enzyme Inhibitors; HeLa Cells; Histone Demethylases; Humans; Molecular Docking Simulation; Peptides; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-84959347787

The replication foci targeting sequence (RFTS) of DNMT1 is required for the recruitment of DNMT1 to DNA methylation sites through direct binding to ubiquitylated histone H3 mediated by UHRF1 (Ubiquitin-like containing PHD and RING finger domains 1). Recently, it has been reported that the RFTS plugs the catalytic pocket of DNMT1 in an intermediated manner and inhibits its DNA methyltransferase activity. However, it is unclear whether this binding affects RFTS function in terms of recruitment to DNA methylation sites. Using Xenopus egg extracts, we demonstrate here that abrogation of the interaction between the RFTS and the catalytic center of DNMT1, by deletion of the C-terminal portion or disruption of the hydrogen bond, results in non-ubiquitylated histone H3 binding and abnormal accumulation of DNMT1 on the chromatin. Interestingly, DNMT1 mutants identified in patients with a neurodegenerative disease, ADCA-DN, bound to non-ubiquitylated histone H3 and accumulated on chromatin during S phase in Xenopus egg extracts. These results suggest that the interaction between the RFTS and the catalytic center of DNMT1 serves as an autoinhibitory mechanism for suppressing the histone H3 binding of DNMT1 and ensuring the accurate recruitment of DNMT1 to sites of DNA methylation. The autoinhibitory mechanism may play an important role in the regulation of gene expression in neurogenesis. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Thrombin, which is rapidly generated from pro-thrombin through the activation of factor X to FXa, acts as a potent activator of human platelets. Thus, the reduction of thrombin generation by FXa inhibitor eventually causes a suppressive effect on platelet aggregation. However, little is known whether FXa inhibitors directly affect the function of human platelets. We have previously reported that collagen induces the phosphorylation of heat shock protein 27 (HSP27), a low-molecular weight heat shock protein via Rac-dependent activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase in human platelets, eventually resulting in the release of HSP27. In the present study, we investigated the direct effect of FXa inhibitor on the collagen-induced human platelet activation. Rivaroxaban as well as edoxaban significantly reduced the collagen-induced phosphorylation of both HSP27 and p44/p42 MAP kinase without affecting the platelet aggregation. Rivaroxaban significantly inhibited the release of phosphorylated HSP27 from collagen-stimulated platelets but not the secretion of platelet derived growth factor-AB. In patients administrated with rivaroxaban, the collagen-induced levels of phosphorylated HSP27 were markedly diminished after 2 days of administration, which failed to affect the platelet aggregation. These results strongly suggest that FXa inhibitor reduces the collagen-stimulated release of phosphorylated HSP27 from human platelets due to the inhibition of HSP27 phosphorylation via p44/p42 MAP kinase. ? 2016 Tsujimoto et al.

Tribbles genes are evolutionary conserved, and three TRB genes (TRB1, TRB2 and TRB3) have been identified in mammals. TRBs are considered pseudokinases because they lack an ATP binding site or one of the conserved catalytic motifs essential for kinase activity. Instead, TRBs play important roles in various cellular processes as scaffolds or adaptors to promote the degradation of target proteins and to regulate several key signaling pathways. Recent research has focused on the role of TRBs in tumorigenesis and neoplastic progression.

Based on a review of the scientific literature, we present recommendations as guiding principles to administer SLIT safely. Methods: Clinical questions concerning SLIT were prepared. Literature published between January 2003 and December 2012 was searched from PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Japana Centra Revuo Medicina. Qualified studies were analyzed and the results were evaluated, consolidated, and codified. We answered 17 clinical questions and, based on this, presented evidence-based recommendations. Results: Sublingual immunotherapy improved symptoms (e.g., quality of life [QOL]) and reduced medication scores in seasonal AR and perennial AR. Most SLIT-induced adverse effects were local oral reactions, although systemic adverse effects such as gastrointestinal symptoms, urticaria, and asthma are occasionally reported. There have been no reports of lethal anaphylactic reactions by SLIT. When SLIT is continued for 3-years, its effect persists long after discontinuation. Conclusion: A correct diagnosis of AR and sufficient informed consent from patients are required before initiating SLIT. Sublingual immunotherapy should be continued for 3 years or longer. The initial administration of SLIT during the uptitration of an allergen vaccine and the general condition of patients are critical for the safe performance of SLIT. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Allergic rhinitis; Guideline; Subcutaneous immunotherapy; Sublingual immunotherapy,"allergic rhinitis; allergy; anaphylaxis; Article; asthma; conjunctivitis; disease association; evidence based practice; fatality; gastrointestinal symptom; human; Japanese (people); patient safety; pollen allergy; practice guideline; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); scoring system; sensitization; sublingual immunotherapy; systematic review; treatment contraindication; treatment indication; urticaria; adverse effects; chemically induced; gastrointestinal disease; Japan; procedures; Rhinitis, Allergic; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; sublingual immunotherapy; allergen; Allergens; Asthma; Gastrointestinal Diseases; Humans; Japan; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality of Life; Rhinitis, Allergic; Rhinitis, Allergic, Perennial; Rhinitis, Allergic, Seasonal; Sublingual Immunotherapy; Urticaria",2-s2.0-84958058886

On the basis of the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II instrument, which reflects evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, a working group of the Japanese Society of Clinical Oncology (JSCO) reviewed clinical practice guidelines for antiemesis and performed a systematic review of evidence-based domestic practice guidelines for antiemetic therapy in Japan. In addition, because health-insurance systems in Japan are different from those in other countries, a consensus was reached regarding standard treatments for chemotherapy that induce nausea and vomiting. Current evidence was collected by use of MEDLINE, from materials from meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology National Comprehensive Cancer Network, and from European Society of Medical Oncology/Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer guidelines for antiemesis. Initially, 21 clinical questions (CQ) were selected on the basis of CQs from other guidelines. Patients treated with highly emetic agents should receive a serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5HT3) receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, and a neurokinin 1 receptor antagonist. For patients with moderate emetic risk, 5HT3 receptor antagonists and dexamethasone were recommended, whereas for those receiving chemotherapy with low emetic risk dexamethasone only is recommended. Patients receiving high-emetic-risk radiation therapy should also receive a 5HT3 receptor antagonist. In this paper the 2010 JSCO clinical practice guidelines for antiemesis are presented in English; they reveal high concordance of Japanese medical circumstances with other antiemetic guidelines that are similarly based on evidence. ? 2015, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Antiemetic treatment; Cancer chemotherapy; Clinical practice guideline,"alprazolam; antiemetic agent; antineoplastic agent; aprepitant; azasetron; benzodiazepine; cisplatin; cytochrome P450 2C9; cytochrome P450 3A4; dexamethasone; granisetron; indisetron; lorazepam; octreotide; ondansetron; opiate; palonosetron; ramosetron; serotonin 3 antagonist; tropisetron; antiemetic agent; advanced cancer; anorexia; anticipatory nausea and vomiting; area under the curve; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; carcinomatous peritonitis; chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting; childhood cancer; conflict of interest; drug blood level; drug effect; dyspepsia; evidence based practice; gastrostomy; health insurance; heartburn; high risk patient; human; ileus; Japanese (people); low risk patient; medical oncologist; metastasis; nasogastric tube; nausea and vomiting; opioid induced emesis; patient assessment; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); practice guideline; priority journal; radiation injury; systematic review; world health organization; chemically induced; Japan; medical society; nausea; oncology; time factor; vomiting; Antiemetics; Antineoplastic Agents; Dexamethasone; Humans; Japan; Medical Oncology; Nausea; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Serotonin 5-HT3 Receptor Antagonists; Societies, Medical; Time Factors; Vomiting",2-s2.0-84957845519

Methods Here, we present a multi-center randomized trial that compared the CBD recurrence rate after bile duct stone removal between patients given ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and the untreated group. A total of 36 patients were randomly assigned to either the UDCA (n = 15) or the untreated group (n = 21). The primary end-point was the recurrence rate of CBD stones. Results The recurrence rate of CBD stones was 6.6% in the UDCA group and 18.6% in the untreated group (P = 0.171). A multivariate analysis found that not receiving UDCA was an independent risk factor for stone recurrence. The recurrence rates of CBD stones did not differ by sex, past history of cholecystectomy, or the presence of gallstones. Conclusions Our findings indicate that UDCA may be a novel treatment strategy to prevent the recurrence of CBD stones. However, further evaluation of UDCA in a larger number of subjects will be required to confirm the applicability of these results. Highlight To address the lack of an established pharmacologic treatment, Yamamoto and colleagues set out to assess the efficacy of ursodeoxycholic acid in preventing recurrence of common bile duct stones after endoscopic removal in a multi-center ramdomized trial. Their findings indicate that ursodeoxycholic acid administration is a promising preventive treatment strategy. ? 2015 Japanese Society of Hepato-Biliary-Pancreatic Surgery.",Common bile duct stones; Randomized controlled trial; Recurrence; Ursodeoxycholic acid,"ursodeoxycholic acid; ursodeoxycholic acid; acute pancreatitis; adult; aged; Article; bile duct stone; bile duct stone removal; blood examination; body mass; bradycardia; cholecystectomy; cholecystitis; clinical article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; dyslipidemia; echography; endoscopic echography; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic sphincterotomy; endoscopic surgery; female; follow up; gallstone; health status; high risk patient; human; hypertension; incidence; lifestyle; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; male; medical history; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; open study; postoperative hemorrhage; proportional hazards model; recurrent disease; risk factor; sex difference; treatment duration; very elderly; young adult; clinical trial; Gallstones; middle aged; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cholecystectomy; Female; Gallstones; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Ursodeoxycholic Acid",2-s2.0-84957717625

The aim of this prospective study was to measure the bone gain around the dental implant after using the crestal approach to sinus floor elevation using platelet-rich fibrin as the only grafting material in atrophic posterior maxillae with residual bone height <5 mm. Materials and Methods: Two different types of implants were used: hydroxyapatite (HA) and sandblasted acid-etched (SA) implants. Panoramic radiography and computed tomography were used to measure the endosinus bone gain. Results: Twenty-seven patients with 39 implants (19 HA and 20 SA) were included in this study. The mean residual bone measurements before surgery in the SA and HA groups were 2.85 and 2.68 mm, respectively. The mean average bone gains for 1 year in the SA and HA groups were 4.38 and 4.00 mm, respectively. Conclusion: This prospective study showed that platelet-rich fibrin promoted endosinus bone gain when used as the grafting material in the crestal approach to sinus floor elevation. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",fibrin; maxillary sinus; sinus augmentation; surgical dental prosthesis,"fibrin; adult; aged; alveolar bone loss; bone regeneration; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; drug effects; female; human; male; Maxillary Diseases; middle aged; panoramic radiography; procedures; prospective study; sinus floor augmentation; thrombocyte; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Alveolar Bone Loss; Blood Platelets; Bone Regeneration; Female; Fibrin; Humans; Male; Maxillary Diseases; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Radiography, Panoramic; Sinus Floor Augmentation; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84956922862

Prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) presumably improves symptoms in patients with LSCS by improving the blood flow in the cauda equina and nerve roots through its vasodilation and antiplatelet aggregation effects. The purpose of the study was to summarize the results of previous studies regarding PGE1 treatment for LSCS and to describe the details of PGE1 treatment to all physicians who take care of patients with LSCS. Methods: Review of the literature. Results: There are 3 PGE1-related products that have been used clinically for the treatment of LSCS: PGE1, lipo-PGE1, and limaprost (PGE1 derivativeExperimental studies have been performed to verify the efficacy of PGE1 treatment for LSCS. Many studies have reported clinical outcomes of PGE1 treatment in patients with LSCS. Overall, previous studies examining PGE1 treatment for LSCS demonstrate improvement in several clinical outcome measures such as the visual analog scale, Japanese Orthopaedic Association score, and NIC distance, although most of the studies have only short-term follow-up. Conclusions: Based on the results of previous studies, PGE1 treatment may be an option as a conservative treatment for LSCS. However, future studies with high-quality and long-term follow-up are necessary. Future studies also should include refinement of indications, administration period, as well as comparisons between PGE1 treatment and other conservative treatments such as epidural injection. ? 2016 World Institute of Pain.",Clinical outcome; Lumbar spinal canal stenosis; Neurogenic intermittent claudication; Prostaglandin E1; Treatment,etodolac; limaprost; lipoprostaglandin E1; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; prostaglandin E1; limaprost; prostaglandin E1; vasodilator agent; abdominal discomfort; anemia; blood flow velocity; Buerger disease; cauda equina; diarrhea; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; edema; gastrointestinal symptom; headache; hot flush; human; hypotension; intermittent claudication; intervertebral diskectomy; Japan; Japanese Orthopaedic Association score; lumbar spinal canal stenosis; lumbar spine; nausea; nerve conduction; nerve root; nonhuman; optimal drug dose; phlebitis; rash; Review; single drug dose; stomach discomfort; stomach ulcer; unspecified side effect; vertebral canal stenosis; vertigo; visual analog scale; walking difficulty; adult; aged; analogs and derivatives; complication; female; intermittent claudication; male; middle aged; Spinal Stenosis; Adult; Aged; Alprostadil; Female; Humans; Intermittent Claudication; Male; Middle Aged; Spinal Stenosis; Vasodilator Agents,2-s2.0-84956906082

The intervention group was given an enteral formula containing lactic acid bacteria-fermented milk products. In addition, two different types of other prebiotics, galacto-oligosaccharide and bifidogenic growth stimulator, were also given. The two prebiotics improved intestinal microbiota differently. In a control group, a standard formula without prebiotics was given. Methods: An enteral formula with (intervention group [F]) or without (control group [C]) prebiotics was given through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy to elderly participants for 10 weeks. Influenza vaccine was inoculated at week4. Nutritional and biochemical indices, intestinal micro bacteria and immunological indices were analyzed. Results: The Bifidobacterium count in groupsF and C at week0 was 6.4±1.9 and 6.6±3.0 (log10 [count/g feces]), respectively. Although the count in groupC decreased at week10, the count in groupF increased. The Bacteroides count in groupF increased from 10.7±0.9 to 11.4±0.5, but decreased in groupC from 11.2±0.2 to 10.7±0.4. Although the enhanced titers of H1N1, H3N2 and B antigens against the vaccine decreased thereafter in groupC, these enhanced titers in groupF could be maintained.

The present post-hoc study aimed to evaluate the differences in clinical characteristics between responders and non-responders among FD patients who received rikkunshito for 8weeks. Methods: Rikkunshito responders were defined by using a global patient assessment. Candidate predictors included age, gender, smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, comorbidity, Helicobacter pylori infection, plasma levels of acyl ghrelin and des-acyl ghrelin, severity of dyspeptic symptoms, FD subgroup, previous medication, and the type of recruiting institution (clinic or hospital). We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) by using Cox regression analysis with the factors that were indicated to be associated with responders. Results: We assigned 83 and 42 patients to responder and non-responder categories, respectively. Lack of alcohol consumption (HR, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 1.08-3.88) and low plasma des-acyl ghrelin levels (<177fmol/mL; HR, 2.42; 95% confidence interval, 1.24-4.73) were significantly associated with the efficacy of rikkunshito. Lack of alcohol consumption was associated with the efficacy of rikkunshito especially among H.pylori-infected participants. On the other hand, the low plasma des-acyl ghrelin was associated with the efficacy of rikkunshito especially among H.pylori-negative participants. Conclusions: A low baseline level of plasma des-acyl ghrelin was associated with an increased treatment efficacy of rikkunshito against FD.

Various viral, host, and environmental factors influence the natural history of HCV infection. Recent genome-wide association studies identified several host genetic factors influencing treatment efficacy or clinical course in HCV infection. A landmark discovery was that IFNL3-IFNL4 variants are strongly associated with responses to interferon-based treatment. Genetic variants in IFNL3-IFNL4 as well as those in HLA class II loci influence the spontaneous clearance of acute HCV infection. Interestingly, these genetic variants also affect the activity of hepatitis, or disease progression in chronic hepatitis C.

Current evidence indicates that peripheral PNETs (pPNETs), which arise in the non-central nervous system, possess histological similarity to Ewing's sarcoma. Though the occurrence of pPNETs in the head and neck region is rare, these are aggressive malignant tumors, and long-term survival rates following diagnosis remain poor. The current report presents a case of pPNET and evaluates its significance with regard to previous studies. In the present case, a tumor was located in the larynx of the patient, and was diagnosed as pPNET. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that tumor cells were positive for cluster of differentiation 99. The patient was treated with surgery, multiagent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Five years subsequent to treatment, the patient had survived and demonstrated no evidence of disease recurrence. In existing literature concerning pPNET located outside the head and neck region, it is recommended that patients are treated with a combination of resection with a wide surgical margin, multiagent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The present case report concluded that the combination of surgery, systematic chemotherapy and radiotherapy, offers an improved outcome for pPNET localized to the head and neck region, compared with any of these therapies alone. ? 2016, Spandidos Publications.

Moreover, most of them reported about a volume reduction in amygdale, which plays a key role in the neural function of SAD. Insula is another region of interest. Its hyperactivity in regard to processing negative emotional information or interoceptive awareness has been detected in patients with SAD. Referring to these studies, we hypothesized that insular volumes might reduce in patients with SAD and made a comparison of insular volumes between 13 patients with SAD and 18 healthy controls with matched age and gender using voxel-based morphometry. As a result, we found a significant volume reduction in insula in the SAD group. Our results suggest that the patients with SAD might have an insular volume reduction apart from amygdala. Since insula plays a critical role in the pathology of SAD, more attention should be paid not only to functional study but also morphometrical study of insula. ? 2016 Kawaguchi, Nemoto, Nakaaki, Kawaguchi, Kan, Arai, Shiraishi, Hashimoto and Akechi.",Insula; Magnetic resonance imaging; Social anxiety disorder; Voxel-based morphometry,adult; Article; brain size; clinical article; controlled study; demography; disease duration; female; gray matter; human; insula; intelligence quotient; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; social phobia; voxel based morphometry; white matter,2-s2.0-84964661977

A number of screening tests has been employed including clinical examinations and mammography. However, another screening method, which is a simple, not embarrassing, and low cost, is highly desired. Based on these findings, we are currently investigating the determination of polyamines including their acetylated structures for the diagnosis of breast cancer patients. We established a diagnostic approach to breast cancer patients based on the ratios of polyamines in saliva by a UPLC-MS/MS analysis. Methods: Twelve polyamines including their acetylated form were labeled with DBD-F, separated by a reversed-phase chromatography and detected by a Xevo TQ-S tandem mass spectrometer. Results: Eight polyamines (e.g., SPM, CAD, Ac-SPM, N1-Ac-SPD, N8-Ac-SPD) strongly correlated with the cancer patients. A simple 1-order equation was developed for the discrimination of the breast cancer patients and healthy persons (Y=0.5XSPM-3XAc-SPM-0.15XSPD-3.5XN8-Ac-SPD+0.5XN1-Ac-SPD+0.04XCAD). The concordance rate of the breast cancer patients and the healthy persons by the equation was 88% and 76% on the training set, respectively, whereas those on the validation set was both 88%. The score Y in the equation tended to correlate with the cancer stage of the patients and increased with the more serious conditions. The determination of polyamines in the saliva after the cancer patient operations was also performed to identify the concentration change before and after the surgical treatment. The discriminant analysis using 6 polyamines (i.e., N8-Ac-SPD, N1-Ac-SPD, CAD, DAc-SPD, PUT, and Ac-PUT), which were the most influenced molecules derived from the ROC analysis, was performed using the relative percentage. Both the sensitivity and specificity indicated nearly 80% from the ROC analysis result using the ratio of N8-Ac-SPD/(N1-Ac-SPD+N8-Ac-SPD). Conclusion: The discrimination equation appears to be useful for the diagnosis of breast cancer patients. Furthermore, the ratio of N8-Ac-SPD/(N1-Ac-SPD. +. N8-Ac-SPD) may be adopted as an index of the health status after the surgical treatment. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Breast cancer patient; Discrimination equation; Polyamine; Saliva; UPLC-ESI-MS/MS,"cadaverine; n1 acetylspermidine; polyamine; spermidine; spermine; polyamine; acetylation; Article; breast cancer; calibration; cancer patient; cancer staging; diagnostic accuracy; human; hydrophilicity; limit of detection; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometer; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; saliva analysis; saliva level; sensitivity and specificity; separation technique; validity; adult; aged; Breast Neoplasms; chemical structure; chemistry; female; high performance liquid chromatography; metabolism; middle aged; saliva; tandem mass spectrometry; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Female; Humans; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Molecular Structure; Polyamines; Saliva; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",2-s2.0-84946595107

We examined the impacts of colored lights on the autonomic functions by the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV). Methods: A lighting device consisting of four organic light-emitting diode (OLED) modules (55 × 55 mm 2 ) with adjustable red-green-blue color was secured 24 cm above the eyes of subject lying supine in a light-shielded laboratory. Following a 15-min supine rest, electrocardiogram and respiration were measured continuously during 3-min darkness, 6-min colored OLED illumination, and 3-min darkness under paced breathing (15 breath/min). The measurements were repeated at a 45-min interval for red, green, and blue lights with melanopsin-stimulating photon flux density (MSPFD) of 0.00, 0.10, and 0.20 μmol/m 2 /s, respectively, in 12 healthy subjects (23 ± 2 years, two females). Additionally, the effects of blue lights with 0.20, 0.10, and 0.04 μmol/m 2 /s MSPFD were examined in four healthy subjects (25–39 years, two females). HRV was analyzed for low-frequency (LF, 0.04–0.15 Hz) and high-frequency (HF, 0.20–0.30 Hz) power and LF-to-HF ratio (LF/HF). Results: Compared to darkness before lighting, HF power decreased (P &lt; 0.001) and LF/HF increased (P = 0.024) during lighting on average of all color lights, whereas HF power showed a greater decrease with blue light than with red and green lights (P &lt; 0.05 for both). The decrease in HF power lasted even during darkness after lighting (P &lt; 0.001). HF power decreased with blue light with 0.20 μmol/m 2 /s MSPFD (P &lt; 0.001) but not with that with 0. 10 or 0.04 μmol/m 2 /s (P = 0.1 and 0.9, respectively). Conclusions: Vagal cardiac modulation is suppressed by OLED blue light in healthy subjects most likely through melanopsin-dependent non-image-forming effect. ? 2016 The Author(s).

The objective of our study was to analyze the growth characteristics of HBV in tupaia hepatocytes and the host response to HBV infection. We established primary tupaia hepatocytes (3-6-week old tupaia) and infected them with HBV genotypes A, B and C, and all the genotypes proliferated as well as those in human primary hepatocytes (&gt;105 copies/ml in culture supernatant). We next generated a chimeric mouse with tupaia liver by transplantation of tupaia primary hepatocytes to urokinase-type plasminogen activator cDNA (cDNA-uPA)/severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and the replacement ratio with tupaia hepatocytes was found to be more than 95%. Infection of chimeric mice with HBV (genotypes B, C, and D) resulted in HBV-DNA level of 104-106 copies/ml after 8 weeks of infection, which were almost similar to that in humanized chimeric mouse. In contrast, serum HBV level in adult tupaia (1-year-old tupaia) was quite low (&lt;103 copies/ml). Understanding the differences in the response to HBV infection in primary tupaia hepatocytes, chimeric mouse, and adult tupaia will contribute to elucidating the mechanism of persistent HBV infection and viral eradication. Thus, T. belangeri was found to be efficient for studying the host response to HBV infection, thereby providing novel insight into the pathogenesis of HBV. ? 2015 The Authors.",Chimeric mouse; HBV; Primary hepatocytes; Tupaia belangeri,virus DNA; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell proliferation; controlled study; female; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype A; Hepatitis B virus genotype B; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; human; human cell; immune response; liver cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; SCID mouse; Tupaia belangeri; virogenesis; virus replication; animal; Hepatitis B virus; liver cell; physiology; Tupaia; virology; virus replication; Animals; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatocytes; Mice; Tupaia; Virus Replication,2-s2.0-84951163403

Therefore, membrane-bound Aβ species can be promising targets for the development of novel drugs for Alzheimer's disease. In the present study, solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy has elucidated the membrane-induced conformation of Aβ, in which the disordered N-Terminal segment is followed by the stable C-Terminal β strand.

Sphingolipids are often altered in cancer, though how these alterations lead to tumor formation and progression is largely unknown. Here, we analyzed non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) specimens and cell lines and determined that ceramide synthase 6 (CERS6) is markedly overexpressed compared with controls. Elevated CERS6 expression was due in part to reduction of microRNA-101 (miR-101) and was associated with increased invasion and poor prognosis. CERS6 knockdown in NSCLC cells altered the ceramide profile, resulting in decreased cell migration and invasion in vitro, and decreased the frequency of RAC1-positive lamellipodia formation while CERS6 overexpression promoted it. In murine models, CERS6 knockdown in transplanted NSCLC cells attenuated lung metastasis. Furthermore, combined treatment with l-α-dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine liposome and the glucosylceramide synthase inhibitor D-PDMP induced cell death in association with ceramide accumulation and promoted cancer cell apoptosis and tumor regression in murine models. Together, these results indicate that CERS6-dependent ceramide synthesis and maintenance of ceramide in the cellular membrane are essential for lamellipodia formation and metastasis. Moreover, these results suggest that targeting this homeostasis has potential as a therapeutic strategy for CERS6-overexpressing NSCLC.",,"ceramide; ceramide glucosyltransferase inhibitor; ceramide synthase 6; dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; microRNA 101; synthetase; unclassified drug; ceramide; CERS6 protein, human; dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; membrane protein; microRNA; MIRN101 microRNA, human; sphingosine acyltransferase; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer prognosis; cell death; cell invasion; cell membrane; cell migration; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene silencing; human; human cell; in vitro study; lung metastasis; mouse; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; phospholipid synthesis; priority journal; tumor invasion; tumor regression; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; drug effects; genetics; Lung Neoplasms; male; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; phenotype; physiology; tumor cell line; Animals; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Ceramides; Dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; MicroRNAs; Neoplasm Metastasis; Phenotype; Sphingosine N-Acyltransferase",2-s2.0-84956617449

The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine 7 (PCV7) was licensed for use in Japan in 2010 followed by PCV13 in 2013. This report includes the results of a nationwide surveillance of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and non-IPD in paediatric patients from January 2012 to December 2014. We collected 343 isolates from 337 IPD patients and 286 isolates from 278 non-IPD patients. Of the IPD isolates, the most identified serotypes included 19A, 24F, and 15A. The prevalence of non-PCV13 serotype isolates increased significantly from 2012 to 2014 (51.6-71.4%, p=0.004). Serotypes 19A, 15A and 35B were highly non-susceptible to penicillin, and the rates of non-susceptible isolates from IPD patients to penicillin and cefotaxime significantly declined during the study period (p=0.029 and p=0.013, respectively). The non-susceptible rate to meropenem increased, particularly for serotype 15A. The IPD isolates comprised clonal complex (CC) 3111 (93.8% was serotype 19A) followed by CC2572 (81.5% was serotype 24F) and CC63 (97.1% was serotype 15A). CC3111, CC63 and CC156 (33.3% was serotype 23A, 28.6% was serotype 6B, and 14.3% was serotype 19A) were highly non-susceptible to penicillin. Of the non-IPD isolates, the most identified serotypes included 19A, 15A, and 3.

Methods: In an open-labelled prospective study, we evaluated the efficacy of adalimumab with and without azathioprine in patients with active Crohn's disease, who were na?ve to biologics and thiopurines. The patients were randomly assigned to subcutaneous administration of adalimumab [monotherapy group] or to exactly the same schedule of adalimumab with azathioprine [25- 100 mg daily] [combination group] for 52 Weeks. The primary endpoint was clinical remission at WWeek 26. We also evaluated the score for simple endoscopic severity of Crohn's disease before the therapy and at WWeeks 26 and 52. Results: A total of 176 patients were randomized to either the monotherapy group [n = 85] or to the combination group [n = 91]. Eighteen patients [21.2%] from the monotherapy group and 7 patients [7.7%] from the combination group withdrew owing to active disease, and 15 patients [16.5%] from the combination group and 1 patient [1.2%] from the monotherapy group withdrew due to side effects of the medications. Non-responder imputation analysis revealed that the remission rate at WWeek 26 did not differ between the monotherapy group and the combination group [71.8% vs 68.1%; OR 0.84, p = 0.63]. The rate of endoscopic improvement at WWeek 26 was significantly higher in the combination group [84.2%, n = 57] than in the monotherapy group [63.8%, n = 58] [p = 0.019]. Conclusion: The clinical efficacy of a combination of adalimumab and azathioprine at WWeek 26 did not differ from that of adalimumab monotherapy in patients with Crohn's disease na?ve to both medications. ? 2016 European Crohn's and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).

However, non-intubated thoracic surgery has been gradually developed in recent years for thoracoscopic surgery, due to its lower rate of postoperative complications, shorter hospitalization duration, and lower invasiveness than the usual singlelung anesthesia. Initially, only minor thoracoscopic surgery, including wedge resection for pneumothorax and the diagnosis of solitary pulmonary nodules, was performed under waking anesthesia. However, major thoracoscopic surgery, including segmentectomy and lobectomy, has also been performed under these conditions in some institutions due to its advantages with respect to the postoperative recovery and inoperating room time. In addition, non-intubated thoracic surgery has been performed for tracheal resection followed by reconstruction to fully explore the advantages of this surgical modality. In this article, the merits and demerits of non-intubated thoracoscopic surgery and the postoperative complications, perioperative problems and optimum selection criteria for patients for thoracic surgery (mainly airway surgery) are discussed. ?

Methods: From January 2008 to September 2013, 207 patients with new onset high-grade T1 bladder cancer after an initial TUR were treated at our university and at affiliated hospitals. Residual cancer rate, intravesical recurrence-free survival (RFS), and risk factors for intravesical recurrence were analyzed. Results: Among a total of 207 patients, 42 patients were treated with BCG therapy following a second TUR (group 1), 23 were treated with second TUR alone (group 2), 72 were treated with BCG alone (group 3), and 70 were treated without a second TUR or BCG. The median patients' age was 72.0 years, and the median follow-up period was 33.5 months. The second TUR revealed that 34 patients (52 %) had residual cancer. Between groups 1 and 2 and groups 1 and 3, the differences in RFS were statistically significant (p< = 0.002 and 0.045, respectively). In addition, BCG therapy was the most significant factor to predict RFS after the second TUR. Among the 31 patients whose pathology of the second TUR was pT0, only 1 of 12 patients (8 %) in group 1 and 11 of 19 patients (58 %) in group 2 had a recurrence.

The most widely used anti-angiogenic drug is bevacizumab, a humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody that targets human VEGFA. Although bevacizumab does not recognize mouse Vegfa, it inhibits angiogenesis in mice. Here we show bevacizumab suppressed angiogenesis in three mouse models not via Vegfa blockade but rather Fc-mediated signaling through FcγRI (CD64) and c-Cbl, impairing macrophage migration. Other approved humanized or human IgG1 antibodies without mouse targets (adalimumab, alemtuzumab, ofatumumab, omalizumab, palivizumab and tocilizumab), mouse IgG2a, and overexpression of human IgG1-Fc or mouse IgG2a-Fc, also inhibited angiogenesis in wild-type and FcγR humanized mice. This anti-angiogenic effect was abolished by Fcgr1 ablation or knockdown, Fc cleavage, IgG-Fc inhibition, disruption of Fc-FcγR interaction, or elimination of FcRγ-initated signaling. Furthermore, bevacizumab’s Fc region potentiated its anti-angiogenic activity in humanized VEGFA mice. Finally, mice deficient in FcγRI exhibited increased developmental and pathological angiogenesis. These findings reveal an unexpected anti-angiogenic function for FcγRI and a potentially concerning off-target effect of hIgG1 therapies. ? 2016 West China Hospital, Sichuan University.",,,2-s2.0-85009106495

To elucidate critical molecular changes in NBNC-HCC, we integrated three large datasets relating to comprehensive array-based analysis of genome-wide DNA methylation (N = 43 pairs) and mRNA/miRNA expression (N = 15, and 24 pairs, respectively) via statistical modeling. Results: Hierarchical clustering of DNA methylation in miRNA coding regions clearly distinguished NBNC-HCC tissue samples from relevant background tissues, revealing a remarkable tumor-specific hypomethylation cluster. In addition, miRNA clusters were extremely hypomethylated in tumor samples (median methylation change for non-clustered miRNAs: -2.3%, clustered miRNAs: -24.6%). The proportion of CpGs hypomethylated in more than 90% of the samples was 55.9% of all CpGs within miRNA clusters, and the peak methylation level was drastically shifted from 84% to 39%. Following statistical adjustment, the difference in methylation levels within miRNA coding regions was positively associated with their expression change. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed a great discriminatory ability in respect to cluster-miRNA methylation. Moreover, miRNA methylation change was negatively correlated with corresponding target gene expression amongst conserved and highly matched miRNA sites. Conclusions: We observed a drastic negative shift of methylation levels in miRNA cluster regions. Changes in methylation status of miRNAs were more indicative of target gene expression and pathological diagnosis than respective miRNA expression changes, suggesting the importance of genome-wide miRNA methylation for tumor development. Our study dynamically summarized global miRNA hypomethylation and its genome-wide scale consequence in NBNC-HCC. ? 2016 Nojima et al.",Global hypomethylation; MicroRNA; MicroRNA cluster; MicroRNA regulation; Non-B non-C hepatocellular carcinoma; Statistical modeling,"DNA methyltransferase 1; DNA methyltransferase 3A; DNA methyltransferase 3B; microRNA; microRNA; transcriptome; 3' untranslated region; area under the curve; Article; controlled study; CpG island; DNA barcoding; DNA methylation; epigenetics; gene cluster; gene control; gene expression; gene locus; genome-wide association study; human; human cell; Italy; Japan; Korea; liver cell carcinoma; protein expression; receiver operating characteristic; transcription initiation site; biology; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; cell transformation; cluster analysis; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic epigenesis; genetics; Liver Neoplasms; multigene family; procedures; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Epigenomics; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; MicroRNAs; Multigene Family; Transcriptome",2-s2.0-85007467215

Methods: The Japan Collaborative Cohort (JACC) Study is a nationwide prospective study, initiated in 1988, which involves 110,585 subjects (age range: from 40 to 79 years; 46,395 males and 64,190 females). Our present analysis population comprised 96,081 (40,510 men and 55,571 women) who provided details on DM history. The questionnaire also included age, sex, weight, height, family history of CRC, smoking, drinking and exercise habits, and education. Cox proportional-hazard regression was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR). We used SPSS 21 software to analyze all data. Results: Among the participants with DM, we followed up for 71,174 person-years and 640. deaths from CRC were confirmed; and, among the non-diabetic participants, 785 CRC deaths were identified during 1,499,324 person-years. After adjusting for multivariate confounding factors, such as age, sex, body mass index (BMI), family history of colorectal cancer, smoking habit, drinking habit, physical activity (sports and walking) and education, DM was associated with an increased risk of CRC death (HR 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-2.0). Diabetic women, but not diabetic men, experienced increased mortality from CRC (HR 1.7, 95% CI 1.0-3.0).

ARL4C overexpression, due to Wnt/β-catenin and EGF/Ras signaling alterations, was involved in tumorigenesis. It was also reported that ARL4C expression correlates with DNA hypomethylation in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of ARL4C gene during lymphogenesis. The current study was conducted to investigate the expression and functions of ARL4C due to DNA hypomethylation in lung and tongue cancers. Immunohistochemical analyses of tissue specimens obtained from lung and tongue squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients revealed that ARL4C is not observed in non-tumor regions, but is strongly expressed at high frequencies in tumor lesions. Although inhibition of Wnt/β-catenin or Ras/MAP kinase signaling did not decrease ARL4C expression in NCI-H520 lung SCC cells, ARL4C DNA was clearly hypomethylated in the 3'-UTR. Ten-eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase (TET) enzyme, which mediates DNA demethylation, was highly expressed in NCI-H520 cells. Knockout of TET family proteins (TET1-3) in NCI-H520 cells reduced 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC) levels and promoted DNA methylation in the 3'-UTR, leading to the decrease in ARL4C expression and ARL4C-mediated cellular migration.

Photodynamic diagnosis (PDD) uses the phenomenon of photosensitizer emitting fluorescence to distinguish some tumors from normal tissue. The standard photosensitizer used for PDD is 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA), although it is not entirely satisfactory. We previously reported glucoseconjugated chlorin (G-chlorin) as a more effective photosensitizer than another widely used photosensitizer, talaporfin sodium (TS); however, G-chlorin is hydrophobic. We synthesized oligosaccharide-conjugated chlorin (O-chlorin) with improved watersolubility. We report herein on its accumulation and cytotoxicity. O-chlorin was synthesized and examined for solubility. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to evaluate O-chlorin accumulation in cancer cells. To evaluate the intracellular localization of photosensitizer, cells were stained with O-chlorin and organelle-specific fluorescent probes. We then measured the in vitro fluorescence of various photosensitizers and the half-maximal inhibitory concentrations to evaluate effects in PDD and PDT, respectively. Xenograft tumor models were established, and antitumor and visibility effects were analyzed. O-chlorin was first shown to be hydrophilic. Flow cytometry then revealed a 20- to 40-times higher accumulation of O-chlorin in cancer cells than of TS, and a 7- to 23-times greater fluorescence than 5-ALA. In vitro, the cytotoxicity of O-chlorin PDT was stronger than that of TS PDT, and O-chlorin tended to accumulate in lysosomes. In vivo, O-chlorin showed the best effect in PDT and PDD compared to other photosensitizers. O-chlorin was hydrophilic and showed excellent tumor accumulation and fluorescence.

Methods: We developed and evaluated liquid biopsy assays for detection of TKIsensitizing and T790M mutations of EGFR by droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) in EGFR mutation-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with acquired EGFRTKI resistance. Results: A total of 260 patients was enrolled between November 2014 and March 2015 at 29 centers for this West Japan Oncology Group (WJOG 8014LTR) study. Plasma specimens from all subjects as well as tumor tissue or malignant pleural effusion or ascites fluid from 41 patients were collected after the development of EGFR-TKI resistance. All plasma samples were genotyped successfully and the results were reported to physicians within 14 days.

We studied 130 CHC patients prospectively followed over several decades. A comprehensive miRNA profile in plasma using microarray with 2578 probe sets showed 323 miRNAs differentially expressed between healthy individuals and CHC patients, but only six that distinguished patients with mild versus severe chronic hepatitis. Eventually, let-7a/7c/7d-5p and miR-122-5p were identified as candidate predictors of disease progression. Cross-sectional analyses at the time of initial liver biopsy showed that reduced levels of let-7a/7c/7d-5p (let-7s) in plasma were correlated with advanced histological hepatic fibrosis stage and other fibrotic markers, whereas miR-122-5p levels in plasma were positively correlated with inflammatory activity, but not fibrosis. Measuring let-7s levels in EVs was not superior to intact plasma for discriminating significant hepatic fibrosis. Longitudinal analyses in 60 patients with paired liver biopsies showed that let-7s levels in plasma markedly declined over time in parallel with fibrosis progression. However, circulating let-7s levels did not parallel those in the liver. Conclusion: Of all miRNAs screened, the let-7 family showed the best correlation with hepatic fibrosis in CHC. A single determination of let-7s levels in plasma did not have superior predictive value for significant hepatic fibrosis compared with that of fibrosis-4 index, but the rate of let-7s decline in paired longitudinal samples correlated well with fibrosis progression. Pathway analysis suggested that low levels of let-7 may influence hepatic fibrogenesis through activation of transforming growth factor β signaling in hepatic stellate cells.

Although many defects in ribosome-related genes have been investigated, little is known about contribution of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in ribosome-related disorders. Meanwhile, microRNA (miRNA), an important regulator of gene expression, is derived from both coding and noncoding region of the genome and is implicated in various diseases. Therefore, we performed in silico analyses using M-fold, TargetScan, GeneCoDia3, and so forth to investigate RNA relationships between rRNA and miRNA against cellular stresses. We have previously shown that miRNA synergism is significantly correlated with disease and the miRNA package is implicated in memory for diseases; therefore, quantum Dynamic Nexus Score (DNS) was also calculated using MESer program. As a result, seventeen RNA sequences identical with known miRNAs were detected in the human rRNA and termed as rRNA-hosted miRNA analogs (rmiRNAs). Eleven of them were predicted to form stem-loop structures as pre-miRNAs, and especially one stem-loop was completely identical with hsa-pre-miR-3678 located in the non-rDNA region. Thus, these rmiRNAs showed significantly high DNS values, participation in regulation of cancer-related pathways, and interaction with nucleolar RNAs, suggesting that rmiRNAs may be stress-responsible resident miRNAs which transmit stress-tuning information in multiple levels. ? 2016 Masaru Yoshikawa and Yoichi Robertus Fujii.",,"microRNA; microRNA 1268a; microRNA 1268b; microRNA 1275; microRNA 3648; microRNA 3656; microRNA 3687; microRNA 4417; microRNA 4466; microRNA 4488; microRNA 4492; microRNA 4508; microRNA 4516; microRNA 4532; microRNA 6087; microRNA 663a; microRNA 663b; microRNA 6724; ribosome RNA; unclassified drug; microRNA; ribosome RNA; RNA; animal experiment; Article; carcinogenesis; cell stress; computer model; controlled study; cytoplasm; cytoplasmic cancer stress; disease course; Dynamic Nexus Score; human; memory; mouse; neoplasm; nonhuman; protein secondary structure; ribosome; RNA analysis; RNA sequence; RNA structure; scoring system; structure analysis; genetics; metabolism; neoplasm; physiological stress; RNA folding; Cytoplasm; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; RNA Folding; RNA, Neoplasm; RNA, Ribosomal; Stress, Physiological",2-s2.0-84982801629

We have previously shown that glycoconjugated chlorin (G-chlorin) has superior cancer cell selectivity and effectively suppresses the growth of xenograft tumors. In the present study, we evaluated the immunogenicity of PDT with G-chlorin treatment in colon cancer cells.

Cancer cells, unlike normal cells, respond to fasting by promoting oncogenic signaling and protein synthesis. We hypothesized that fasting would increase the replication of oncolytic herpes simplex virus (oHSV) in GBM. Patient-derived GBM cell lines were fasted by growth in glucose and fetal calf serum restricted culture medium. ""Transient fasting"", 24-hour fasting followed by 24-hour recovery in complete medium, increased late virus gene expression and G47Δ yields about 2-fold in GBM cells, but not in human astrocytes, and enhanced G47Δ killing of GBM cells. Mechanistically, ""transient fasting"" suppressed phosphorylation of the subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in GBM cells, but not in astrocytes. Pharmacological inhibition of JNK also increased G47Δ yield. In vivo, transient fasting (48-hour food restriction and 24-hour recovery) doubled luciferase activity after intratumoral G47Δ-US11fluc injection into orthotopic GBM xenografts. Thus, ""transient fasting"" increases G47Δ replication and oncolytic activity in human GBM cells.

The purpose of this study was to compare the angiographic findings of polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) detected by indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) and en face optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). METHODS. The study design was a retrospective chart review of 20 eyes with a clinical diagnosis of treatment-naive PCV, seen at Nagoya City University Hospital between December 2014 and January 2016. Indocyanine green angiography was performed with Heidelberg Retina Angiography 2 and OCTA was performed by using Avanti RTVue XR. RESULTS. Twenty eyes of 20 patients (18 male, 2 female) were studied. Average age was 71.9 years. Manual segmentation was required to detect the pathologic lesions of PCV in all cases. The polypoidal lesions were detected in 20 eyes (100%) by ICGA, and in 17 eyes (85%) by OCTA. The number of polypoidal lesions detected by OCTA averaged 2.6 ± 1.9, with an average of 2.0 ± 1.1 by ICGA (P < 0.05). The branching vascular network (BVN) was detected in 14 eyes (70%) by ICGA and in 14 eyes (70%) by OCTA. All of the BVNs detected by OCTA were located between the RPE and Bruch’s membrane. CONCLUSIONS. Despite the manual segmentation required, en face OCTA enabled us to analyze the angiographic features of PCV combined with longitudinal image (B-scan). En face OCTA may be useful for understanding the pathogenesis of PCV and managing PCV. ? 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

To study the association between the distributions of microaneurysms detected by en face optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and diabetic macular edema (DME). METHODS. The study design was a retrospective chart review of 27 patients (33 eyes) with DME. The eyes were scanned using OCTA (6 × 6 mm) and spectral-domain (SD) OCT macular cube. Each of the images of the capillary plexus was overlaid onto the image of the topographic map, and the densities of the microaneurysms were measured by ImageJ software. The association between the distribution of microaneurysms and macular edema was evaluated. RESULTS. For microaneurysms in areas with and without edema, 77.3 ± 8.1% of these microaneurysms were located in the deep capillary plexuses (DCP). However, in areas of edema where the retinal thickness was more than 400 μm, 91.3 ± 9.1% of the microaneurysms were found in the DCP. This difference was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). In the macular edema area, there was a significantly higher density of microaneurysms in the DCP compared to the superficial capillary plexuses (1.71/mm2 vs. 0.17/mm2, P &lt; 0.001). There was also a significant correlation between the macular volume and the density of microaneurysms in the DCP in edema (r = 0.63, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS. Our study demonstrated a high proportion of microaneurysms in the DCP, as well as a novel association between the distributions of microaneurysms detected by OCTA and DME.

Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of 267 HNSCC patients at Aichi Cancer Center. Of these, 65 patients (24%) were non-drinkers, 104 (39%) were light drinkers (ethanol &lt; 46 g or &lt; 5 days/week), 46 (17%) were moderate drinkers (ethanol intake 46-68 g/day and ? 5 days/week), and 52 (20%) were heavy drinkers (ethanol intake ?69 g and ?5 days/week). The prognostic value of pre-treatment drinking status and ALDH2 polymorphism was investigated using multivariate proportional hazard models. Results: Drinking status was associated with disease-free survival (DFS) in HNSCC patients, with marginal statistical significance (5-year DFS: 67.9% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 53.8-78.4%] for non-drinkers, 57.6% [95% CI, 47.4-66.6%] for light drinkers, 46.1% [95% CI, 30.8-60.1%] for moderate drinkers, and 43.5% [95% CI, 29.3-56.9%] for heavy drinkers; P = 0.088). However, this association lost significance when multivariate analyses were adjusted for established prognostic factors. ALDH2 genotype was not significantly associated with DFS in HNSCC patients (5-year DFS: 85.7% [95% CI, 53.9-96.2%] for Lys/Lys, 56.2% [95% CI, 47.4-64.1%] for Glu/Lys, and 50.5% [95% CI, 40.3-59.7%] for Glu/Glu; P = 0.154). After stratification by ALDH2 genotype, we observed a significant positive dose-response relationship between drinking status and DFS in HNSCC patients with ALDH2 Glu/Glu (Ptrend = 0.029). Conclusions: In this study, we identified a significant positive dose-response relationship between pre-treatment drinking status and DFS in HNSCC patients with ALDH2 Glu/Glu. To confirm this association, further study is warranted. ? 2016 Daisuke Kawakita et al.",Alcohol drinking; ALDH2; Head and neck cancer; Squamous cell carcinoma; Survival,"aldehyde dehydrogenase; adult; aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; disease free survival; drinking behavior; epidemiology; female; follow up; genetic polymorphism; genetics; Head and Neck Neoplasms; human; male; middle aged; prognosis; retrospective study; young adult; Adult; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Aldehyde Dehydrogenase; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Genetic; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84973457546

In each of these cell lines, cell growth, apoptosis, and angiogenesis were evaluated with bevacizumab with and without itraconazole both in vitro and in vivo.RESULTS: Itraconazole suppressed HUVEC growth by apoptosis through inhibition of mitogen-activated protein kinase and ribosomal protein S6 kinase signaling. Itraconazole also suppressed monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 secretion and the growth of CAFs.

However, it has not been elucidated which parameter – strain or strain rate – and which direction of myocardial deformation – longitudinal or circumferential – is the most useful marker of LV relaxation and filling pressure. Methods and Results: We conducted a prospective multicenter study and compared the correlation of tissue Doppler- and STE-derived parameters with the time constant of LV pressure decay (τ) and LV mean diastolic pressure (MDP) in 77 patients. The correlation of early-diastolic mitral annular velocity (e?) with τ was weak (r=?0.32, P<0.01), and that of peak longitudinal strain (LS) was the strongest (r=?0.45, P<0.001) among the STE-derived parameters. There was a modest correlation between LVMDP and the ratio of early-diastolic inflow velocity (E) to e? (E/e?) (r=0.50, P<0.001). In contrast, the ratio of E to LS (E/LS) correlated strongly with LVMDP (r=0.70, P<0.001). The correlation of E/LS with LVMDP was significantly better than that for E/e? (P<0.01). Receiver-operating characteristic analysis showed that E/LS had the largest area under the curve for distinguishing elevated LVMDP (E/LS 0.86, E/e? 0.74, E/A 0.67). Conclusions: STE-derived longitudinal parameters correlated well with LV relaxation and filling pressure. In particular, E/LS could be more accurate than E/e? for estimating LV filling pressure. ? 2016, Japanese Circulation Society.

Major causes of kidney stones remain unclear, and limited data are available on the relationship between overweight/obesity and the incidence of kidney stones. We therefore evaluated body mass index (BMI) and the incidence of kidney stones in Japanese men. Methods: Of the workers at a gas company, 5984 males aged 20-40 years underwent a medical examination in 1985 (baseline). This study includes 4074 of the men, who were free of kidney stones at baseline and underwent a second medical examination performed between April 2004 and March 2005. BMI was calculated from measured height and weight in 1985, and men were categorized into tertiles. The development of kidney stones during followup was based on self-reports from questionnaires at the second medical examination. Results: The average duration of follow-up was 19 years, with 258 participants developing kidney stones during this period. Using the lowest BMI (1st tertile) group as a reference, the hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) for the 2nd and 3rd BMI tertiles were: 1.26 (95% CI, 0.92-1.73) and 1.44 (95% CI, 1.06-1.96), respectively (P for trend = 0.019). After additionally adjusting for potential confounders, such as age, systolic blood pressure, cardiorespiratory fitness, cigarette smoking, and alcohol consumption, the hazard ratios were 1.28 (95% CI, 0.93-1.76) and 1.41 (95% CI, 1.02-1.97), respectively (P for trend = 0.041). Conclusions: These results suggest that increased BMI is a risk factor for kidney stones in Japanese men. ? 2015 Eiichi Yoshimura et al.",Body mass index; Cardiorespiratory fitness; Japanese men; Kidney stone,adult; body mass; cohort analysis; human; incidence; Japan; Kidney Calculi; male; obesity; Overweight; risk factor; young adult; Adult; Body Mass Index; Cohort Studies; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Kidney Calculi; Male; Obesity; Overweight; Risk Factors; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84960386541

We aimed to clarify the diagnostic yields of both methods and the predictive factors Methods: We reviewed 241 patients with biliary strictures who underwent transpapillary brush cytology (n=202) or forceps biopsy (n=208) between 2004 and 2014 at a single academic center. Results: The sensitivity of forceps biopsy for MBS was significantly higher than that of brush cytology [60.6% (97/160) vs 36.1% (57/158), P<0.01). The sensitivity of forceps biopsy was significantly higher in diagnosing bile duct cancer than pancreatic cancer [78.8% (52/66) vs 42.4% (28/66), P<0.01).

Previous reports indicated that connexin 32 (Cx32), which is a major hepatocyte gap junction protein, is downregulated in chronic liver disease and has a protective role in hepatocarcinogenesis. However, functions of Cx32 in alcohol-related hepatocarcinogenesis have not been clarified. To evaluate them, 9-week-old Cx32 dominant negative transgenic (Tg) rats and their wild-type (Wt) littermates were given 1 % or 5 % ethanol (EtOH) or water ad libitum, for 16 weeks after an intraperitoneal injection of diethylnitrosamine (200 mg/kg). EtOH significantly increased the incidence and multiplicity of HCC and total tumors in a dose-dependent manner in Tg rats, but not in Wt rats. Although the number and area of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P) positive foci were not significantly different between the groups, EtOH increased the Ki-67 labeling indices in GST-P positive foci only in Tg rats. EtOH up-regulated phosphorylated Erk1/2 with decrease of the Erk1/2 inhibitor, dual specificity protein phosphatase 1 (Dusp1) in whole livers of Tg and Wt rats. Immunofluorescence staining and quantitative RT-PCR revealed that EtOH significantly increased nucleolar localization of phosphorylated Erk1/2 and contrastingly reduced Dusp1 protein and mRNA expression in GST-P positive foci and HCC of Tg rats as compared to those of Wt rats. These findings suggest that Cx32 dysfunction like in chronic liver disease promoted EtOH-associated hepatocarcinogenesis through dysregulation of Erk-Dusp1 signaling.",Alcohol; Connexin 32; Dusp1; Erk; Hepatocarcinogenesis,"alcohol; complementary DNA; connexin 32; diethylnitrosamine; glutathione transferase; Ki 67 antigen; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase 1; alcohol; connexin 32; Dusp1 protein, rat; gap junction protein; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase phosphatase 1; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer incidence; controlled study; DNA microarray; down regulation; female; gene expression; immunofluorescence test; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell carcinoma; male; nonhuman; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; quantitative analysis; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; transgenic rat; tumor volume; upregulation; wild type rat; animal; apoptosis; cell proliferation; drug effects; drug screening; enzyme immunoassay; fluorescent antibody technique; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; pathology; precancer; real time polymerase chain reaction; Sprague Dawley rat; transgenic animal; tumor cell culture; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Proliferation; Connexins; Dual Specificity Phosphatase 1; Ethanol; Female; Fluorescent Antibody Technique; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Liver Neoplasms; Male; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Precancerous Conditions; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84957643082

To evaluate the prognostic significance of serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) in colorectal cancer (CRC). Patients and Methods. Preoperative serum IL-6 was measured in 233 CRC patients and 13 healthy controls. Relationships between IL-6 and various clinicopathological factors were evaluated, and the overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) rates according to IL-6 status were calculated for all patients and according to disease stage. Results. The mean IL-6 level was 6.6 pg/mL in CRC patients and 2.6 pg/mL in healthy controls. Using a cutoff of 6.3 pg/mL, obtained using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, 57 patients had a high IL-6 level. The mean value was higher for stage II disease than for stage III disease. IL-6 status correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, obstruction, and pT4 disease. The OS differed according to the IL-6 status for all patients, whereas the DFS differed for all patients and for those with stage II disease. The Cox proportional hazards model showed that pT4 disease was an independent risk factor for recurrence in all CRC patients; IL-6, CRP, and pT4 were significant risk factors in stage II patients. Conclusions. The preoperative IL-6 level influences the risk of CRC recurrence. ? 2016 Kazuyoshi Shiga et al.",,C reactive protein; carcinoembryonic antigen; interleukin 6; aged; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; colorectal cancer; controlled study; disease free survival; female; histopathology; human; major clinical study; male; overall survival; preoperative period,2-s2.0-84956953307

Genotype A HBV is associated with an increased risk of HBV progression to chronic infection after acute hepatitis B (AHB) in adults. A nationwide survey was conducted to evaluate the geographic distribution, clinical, and virologic characteristics of genotype A AHB and chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Japan. Methods: Five hundred seventy AHB patients were recruited between 2005 and 2010, and 3682 CHB patients were recruited between 2010 and 2011. HBV genotypes were determined for 552 and 3619 AHB and CHB patients, respectively. Clinical characteristics were compared among different genotypes in AHB and CHB patients. Genomic characteristics of HBV genotype A were examined by molecular evolutionary analysis. Results: Hepatitis B virus genotype A was the predominant genotype for AHB between 2005 and 2010. Phylogenetic analysis showed that all strains in the AHB patients with genotype A were classified into subtype Ae. Among CHB patients, the occurrence of genotype A was 4.1%, and genotype A was spreading in young adults. In genotype A CHB patients, early stage liver diseases were predominant, although liver diseases progressed to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma in some patients. Conclusions: The distribution of HBV genotypes is quite different between AHB and CHB in Japanese patients. Genotype A infection is spreading in young adults of Japanese CHB patients. Sequences derived from Japanese AHB patients were identical to or closely resembled the sequences derived from other Japanese AHB patients. ? 2016 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Acute hepatitis B; Chronic hepatitis B; Distribution; Genotype; Human immunodeficiency virus,"acute hepatitis B; adult; Article; chronic hepatitis B; controlled study; demography; disease carrier; disease course; female; geographic distribution; groups by age; health survey; Hepatitis B virus genotype A; human; Japan; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; liver disease; major clinical study; male; phylogeny; priority journal; virus strain; acute disease; aged; genetics; genotype; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Japan; middle aged; virology; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Female; Genotype; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Phylogeny",2-s2.0-84956944829

The aim of this study was to understand the way endoscopists viewed the application of endoscopy and H. pylori eradication in the elderly of East Asian countries. Methods: Self-administered questionnaires containing 13 questions on endoscopy and H. pylori eradication in the elderly were distributed to major institutions in Japan, South Korea, China, Indonesia, and the Philippines. Results: Two hundred and fifteen endoscopists (111 in Japan, 39 in China, 24 in Korea, 21 in Indonesia, and 20 in the Philippines) participated in this study. In the institutions where these endoscopists were associated, around 50% of patients undergoing endoscopy were above the age of 60 years. The participating endoscopists indicated that the necessity of screening esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy was lower in populations aged over 81 than the other age groups. They hesitated to perform therapeutic endoscopy, such as endoscopic submucosal dissection or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, more often in patients over 85. They also hesitated to perform H. pylori eradication in patients aged over 81, especially in Japan.

We aimed to establish whether S-1 is non-inferior to taxanes in this setting. Methods: We did an open-label, non-inferiority, phase 3 trial at 154 hospitals in Japan. We enrolled individuals who had HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer who had received no chemotherapy for advanced disease, and who were resistant to endocrine treatment. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) either to taxane (docetaxel 60-75 mg/m2 at intervals of 3-4 weeks; paclitaxel 80-100 mg/m2 weekly for 3 of 4 weeks; or paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 at intervals of 3-4 weeks) or to S-1 (40-60 mg twice daily for 28 consecutive days, followed by a 14-day break). Randomisation was done centrally with the minimisation method, with stratification by institution, liver metastasis, oestrogen and progesterone receptor status, previous treatment with taxanes or oral fluorouracil, and time from surgery to recurrence. The primary endpoint was overall survival, with a prespecified non-inferiority margin of 1·333 for the hazard ratio (HR). The primary efficacy analysis was done in the full analysis set, which consisted of all patients who took at least one study treatment and who had all data after randomisation. This trial is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network, Japan (protocol ID C000000416). Findings: Between Oct 27, 2006, and July 30, 2010, we enrolled 618 patients (309 assigned to taxane; 309 assigned to S-1). The full analysis set consisted of 286 patients in the taxane group and 306 in the S-1 group. Median follow-up was 34·6 months (IQR 17·9-44·4). Median overall survival was 35·0 months (95% CI 31·1-39·0) in the S-1 group and 37·2 months (33·0-40·1) in the taxane group (HR 1·05 [95% CI 0·86-1·27]; pnon-inferiority=0·015). The most common grade 3 or worse adverse events were neutropenia (20 [7%] of 307 patients in the S-1 group vs nine [3%] of 290 patients in the taxane group), fatigue (ten [3%] vs 12 [4%]), and oedema (one [&lt;1%] vs 12 [4%]). Treatment-related deaths were reported in two patients in the taxane group. Interpretation: S-1 is non-inferior to taxane with respect to overall survival as a first-line treatment for metastatic breast cancer. S-1 should be considered a new option for first-line chemotherapy for patients with HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.

Emergency surgery is standard therapy for AMCO, and 1-stage surgery without colostomy is preferable, but it is occasionally difficult in the emergency setting. A self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) enables noninvasive colonic decompression and subsequent 1-stage surgery, which has been widely applied for CRC with AMCO. However, recent accumulation of high-quality evidence has highlighted some problems and the limited efficacy of SEMS for AMCO. In palliative settings, SEMS placement reduces hospital stay and short-term complication rates, whereas it increases the frequency of long-term complications, such as delayed perforation. SEMS placement does not seem compatible with recent standard chemotherapy including bevacizumab. As a bridge to surgery, while SEMS placement provides a lower clinical success rate than emergency surgery, it can facilitate primary anastomosis without stoma. However, evidence regarding long-term survival outcomes with SEMS in both palliative and bridge to surgery settings is lacking. The efficacy of transanal colorectal tube placement, another endoscopic treatment, has been reported, but its clinical evidence level is low due to the limited number of studies.

However, few studies have assessed depression and anxiety using reliable psychiatric diagnostic tools. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of depression and anxiety among pancreatic cancer patients before and 1 month after the start of anticancer treatment using reliable psychiatric diagnostic tools, and to identify factors that predict their occurrence. Methods: Pancreatic cancer patients were consecutively recruited. Structured clinical interviews were used to determine the presence of affective disorders, anxiety disorders and adjustment disorders. Baseline interviews were performed prior to initiation of anticancer treatment, while follow-up interviews were performed 1 month after treatment was started. Medical, demographic and psychosocial backgrounds were also assessed as predictive factors. Results: One hundred and ten patients participated in the baseline interview and 91 in the follow-up interview. Depression and anxiety were observed in 15 patients (13.6%) at the baseline, and 15 patients (16.5%) at the follow-up. Lack of confidants was associated with depression and anxiety at the baseline. At the baseline, sadness, lower Karnofsky Performance Status and prior experience with the death of a family member due to cancer predicted newly diagnosed depression and anxiety at the follow-up.

The aim of this study was to assess the value of measuring WFA+-CSF1R levels for the prognosis of carcinogenesis and outcome in liver cirrhosis (LC) patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV). WFA+-CSF1R and Total-CSF1R levels were measured in serum samples from 214 consecutive HCV-infected patients to evaluate their impact on carcinogenesis and the survival of LC patients. Serum WFA+-CSF1R levels were significantly higher in LC patients than chronic hepatitis (CH) patients (p &lt; 0.001). The AUC of WFA+-CSF1R for predicting overall survival, calculated by time-dependent ROC analysis, was 0.691 and the HR (per 1-SD increase) was 1.80 (95% CI, 1.23-2.62, p &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the survival rate of LC patients with high WFA+-CSF1R levels (?310 ng/ml) was significantly worse than those with lower levels (p &lt; 0.01). The AUC of WFA+/total-CSF1R percentage (WFA+-CSF1R%) for predicting the cumulative carcinogenesis rate was 0.760, with an HR of 1.66 (95% CI 1.26-2.20, p &lt; 0.001). In fact, the carcinogenesis rate was significantly higher in LC patients with a high WFA+-CSF1R% (? 35%, p = 0.006). Assessing serum levels of WFA+-CSF1R has diagnostic value for predicting carcinogenesis and the survival of LC patients. What's new? To find better biomarkers of liver fibrosis the authors developed a novel assay to detect serum levels of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-reactive colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (WFA+ -CSF1R). CSF1R is a membrane glycoprotein associated with cell proliferation and found elevated in a variety of cancers. They report that in hepatitis C virus-infected patients who developed liver cirrhosis, the survival rate of patients with high WFA+-CSF1R levels was significantly worse. Similarly, the carcinogenesis rate was higher in patients with high percentage of WFA+-CSF1R, suggesting that this glycobiomarker may have clinical applications beyond the mere evaluation of liver fibrosis. ? 2015 UICC.",hepatocellular carcinoma; liver fibrosis; prognosis; serum biomarker; Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-reactive colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor,"biological marker; colony stimulating factor receptor; n acetylglucosamine receptor; plant lectin; wisteria lectin; adult; aged; blood; cell transformation; complication; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; follow up; human; liver cirrhosis; liver function test; Liver Neoplasms; male; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; receiver operating characteristic; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Liver Cirrhosis; Liver Function Tests; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Plant Lectins; Receptor, Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Receptors, N-Acetylglucosamine; ROC Curve",2-s2.0-84954394601

Methods A case-control study of the risk of obesity and a descriptive study of the risk of age were conducted. We used the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency database, and extracted thromboembolic events of combined oral contraceptive (COC) products. Control data were from the National Health and Nutrition Survey in Japan. Denominator of descriptive study was from IMS Health, JPM. Results A total of 306 thromboembolic events and 6423 controls were analyzed. The odds ratios (95% confidence interval) of the obesity groups (BMI ? 25) were 2.32 (1.71-3.15) for venous thromboembolism (VTE), 1.16 (0.62-2.18) for arterial embolism and thrombosis (ATE), and 1.83 (1.38-2.43) for overall thromboembolic events compared with the standard group (BMI of 18.5-24.9) as a reference. The estimated incidence rates of VTE, ATE and overall thromboembolic events per 10,000 person-years in users of therapeutic remedies for dysmenorrhea (35 μg ethinylestradiol combined with norethisterone, 20 μg ethinylestradiol combined with drospirenone and dienogest) among women aged 10-59 years from 2009 to 2013 were 2.38 (2.08-2.74), 0.63 (0.48-0.82), and 3.17 (2.81-3.57), respectively. This tendency was not seen for dienogest. Conclusions The risk of VTE in the obesity group among COC users was more than 2 times higher than in the standard group. The incidence rates of VTE in Japanese users of all remedies for dysmenorrhea except dienogest were as high as in people in Western countries. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and safety of endoscopic management of these patients. Patients and methods: A retrospective review of medical records was performed to identify adult patients with FAP who refused colectomy and were managed by repeated colonoscopies to remove numerous polyps between 2001 and 2012. Polyps were removed by hot snare polypectomy or endoscopic mucosal resection. Polyps of < 10 mm in size and without endoscopic features suggesting cancer were discarded without histological examination; the remaining polyps were examined histologically. Results: Of the 95 eligible patients, five (5.3 %) were excluded. The remaining 90 patients (median age at first visit 29 years [range 16 - 68 years]; 46 males) were followed for a median of 5.1 years (interquartile range [IQR] 3.3 - 7.3 years). During this period, a total of 55 701 polyps were resected without adverse events such as bleeding or perforation. The median numbers of endoscopic treatment sessions and polyps removed per patient were 8 (IQR 6 - 11) and 475 (IQR 211 - 945), respectively. Five patients had noninvasive carcinoma (Category 4.2 according to the revised Vienna classification), detected within 10 months from the start of the follow-up period. All of these patients were treated endoscopically, without signs of recurrence during a median follow-up of 4.3 years (IQR 2.0 - 7.1 years). No invasive colorectal cancer was recorded during the study period. Two patients (2.2 %) underwent colectomy because the polyposis phenotype had changed to dense polyposis. Conclusion: Endoscopic management of FAP is feasible and safe in the medium term. ?

Previous studies reported that arsenite exposure of only F0 females during their pregnancy increases hepatic tumors in the F1 males in C3H mice, whose males are predisposed spontaneously to develop hepatic tumors later in life. The present study addressed the effects of gestational arsenite exposure on tumorigenesis of the F2 males in C3H mice. Expression analysis of several genes in the normal livers at 53 and 80weeks of age clearly showed significant changes in the F2 males obtained by crossing gestational arsenite-exposed F1 (arsenite-F1) males and females compared to the control F2 males. Some of the changes were shown to occur in a late-onset manner. Then the tumor incidence was assessed at 75-82 weeks of age in the F2 males obtained by reciprocal crossing between the control and arsenite-F1 males and females. The results demonstrated that the F2 males born to arsenite-F1 males developed tumors at a significantly higher rate than the F2 males born to the control F1 males, irrespective of exposure of F1 females. Gene expressions of hepatocellular carcinoma markers β-catenin (CTNNB1) and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist in the tumors were significantly upregulated in the F2 males born to arsenite-F1 males compared to those born to the control F1 males. These results show that arsenite exposure of only F0 pregnant mice causes late-onset changes and augments tumors in the livers of the F2 males by affecting the F1 male offspring. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Arsenic; Gene expression; Gestational exposure; Hepatic tumor; Transgenerational,"alpha fetoprotein; arsenic trioxide; beta catenin; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; arsenic trioxide; arsenous acid derivative; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer incidence; comparative study; controlled study; disease association; environmental exposure; female; gene expression; gestation period; gestational age; liver tumor; male; mouse; nonhuman; pregnancy; priority journal; progeny; real time polymerase chain reaction; somatic mutation; tumor growth; Western blotting; animal; C3H mouse; chemically induced; liver tumor; mutation; oncogene ras; prenatal exposure; Animals; Arsenites; Female; Genes, ras; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C3H; Mutation; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects",2-s2.0-84951809451

We analysed the origin and global dispersal history of genotype 4 using a Bayesian phylogeographical approach. Methods: The 412-nucleotide sequences of open reading frame 2 of genotype 4 (47 Japanese, 40 Chinese, 1 Indian, 8 Indonesian, 1 Korean, 1 Taiwanese, 2 Danish and 2 Italian), of which sampling date and location were known, were collected. Evolutionary rate, divergence time, demographic growth and phylogeography were co-estimated in the Bayesian statistical inference framework implemented in the BEAST package to model spatial dispersal on a time-scaled genealogy. Results: The most probable origin of genotype 4 was Japan and the time of origin was 1909 (95% highest posterior density, 1871–1940). Seven lineages of genotype 4 migrated from Japan to China. The analysis also showed the migration of genotype 4 from Japan or China to India and Indonesia and from China to Indonesia, Taiwan, Korea and a few European countries. Conclusions: Swine trade between countries coincided with the migration time and direction of genotype 4 in some cases and was considered the primary cause of dispersal. However, there was no clear cause of dispersal for some cases, for which no records of pig trade were found. Future research should analyse additional nucleotide sequences paired with epidemiological data from various countries to improve our understanding of HEV dispersal. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In view of the rising interest into the reciprocal link between ciliogenesis and cell cycle, we discuss here several recent advances to understand the molecular link between the individual step of ciliogenesis and cell cycle control. At the onset of ciliogenesis (the transition from centrosome to basal body), distal appendage proteins have been established as components indispensable for the docking of vesicles at the mother centriole. In the initial step of axonemal extension, CP110, Ofd1, and trichoplein, key negative regulators of ciliogenesis, are found to be removed by a kinase-dependent mechanism, autophagy, and ubiquitin-proteasome system, respectively. Of note, their disposal functions as a restriction point to decide that the axonemal nucleation and extension begin. In the elongation step, Nde1, a negative regulator of ciliary length, is revealed to be ubiquitylated and degraded by CDK5-SCFFbw7 in a cell cycle-dependent manner. With regard to ciliary length control, it has been uncovered in flagellar shortening of Chlamydomonas that cilia itself transmit a ciliary length signal to cytoplasm. At the ciliary resorption step upon cell cycle re-entry, cilia are found to be disassembled not only by Aurora A-HDAC6 pathway but also by Nek2-Kif24 and Plk1-Kif2A pathways through their microtubule-depolymerizing activity. On the other hand, it is becoming evident that the presence of primary cilia itself functions as a structural checkpoint for cell cycle re-entry. These data suggest that ciliogenesis and cell cycle intimately link each other, and further elucidation of these mechanisms will contribute to understanding the pathology of cilia-related disease including cancer and discovering targets of therapeutic interventions. ? 2015 Izawa et al.",Cancer; Cell cycle; Ciliogenesis; Primary cilia; Ubiquitin-proteasome system,aurora A kinase; binding protein; cyclin dependent kinase 5; distal appendage protein; histone deacetylase 6; kinesin; membrane protein; microtubule affinity regulating kinase 4; microtubule depolymerizing kinesin; phosphotransferase; polo like kinase 1; Tau tubulin kinase 2; trichoplein; unclassified drug; autophagy; cell cycle; cell cycle regulation; cell elongation; cell function; cell maturation; cell transformation; cellular parameters; centrosome; Chlamydomonas; cytoplasm; depolymerization; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; gene; human; kinetosome; molecular docking; Nde1 gene; nonhuman; Ofd1 gene; primary cilium; priority journal; protein degradation; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; Review; signal transduction,2-s2.0-84995339951

FOP patients harbor point mutations in ACVR1 (also known as ALK2), a type I receptor for bone morphogenetic protein (BMP). Two mechanisms of mutated ACVR1 (FOP-ACVR1) have been proposed: ligand-independent constitutive activity and liganddependent hyperactivity in BMP signaling. Here, by using FOP patientderived induced pluripotent stem cells (FOP-iPSCs), we report a third mechanism, where FOP-ACVR1 abnormally transduces BMP signaling in response to Activin-A, a molecule that normally transduces TGF-β signaling but not BMP signaling. Activin-A enhanced the chondrogenesis of induced mesenchymal stromal cells derived from FOPiPSCs (FOP-iMSCs) via aberrant activation of BMP signaling in addition to the normal activation of TGF-β signaling in vitro, and induced endochondral ossification of FOP-iMSCs in vivo.

However, historical change of the NEO exposure level in humans is poorly understood. The aim of this study is to reveal changes in the levels of NEO and OP exposure in the human body over the last two decades using biomonitoring technique. We quantified urinary concentrations of 7 NEOs (acetamiprid, clothianidin, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, nitenpyram, thiacloprid, and thiamethoxam) and 4 metabolites of OPs (dimethylphosphate, dimethylthiophosphate, diethylphosphate, and diethylthiophosphate) in 95 adult females aged 45-75 in 1994, 2000, 2003, 2009, and 2011 (n = 17-20 different individuals in each year). The results show that the detection rates of urinary NEOs in Japanese women increased significantly between 1994 and 2011, suggesting that intakes of NEOs into the human body rose during that period. In contrast, exposure to OPs having O,O-dimethyl moieties decreased steadily according to a finding that geometric means of urinary dimethylphosphate concentrations kept diminishing considerably. These changes may reflect the amounts of NEOs and OPs used as insecticides in Japan. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Environmental engineering; Environmental protection; Adult females; Detection rates; Diethylthiophosphate; Exposure level; Geometric mean; High selectivity; Historical changes; Neonicotinoids; Insecticides; clothianidin; dialkylphosphate; diethylphosphate; diethylthiophosphate; dimethylphosphate; dimethylthiophosphate; dinotefuran; imidacloprid; neonicotinoid; nitenpyram; organophosphate; thiacloprid; thiamethoxam; unclassified drug; ((E)-1-(2-chloro-1,3-thiazol-5-ylmethyl)-3-methyl-2-nitroguanidine); acetamiprid; diethyl phosphate; dimethyl phosphate; guanidine derivative; imidazole derivative; insecticide; nitro derivative; organophosphate; organophosphorus compound; oxazine derivative; pollutant; pyridine derivative; thiazine derivative; thiazole derivative; bioaccumulation; biomonitoring; organophosphorus pesticide; temporal period; urine; womens health; adult; aged; biological monitoring; exposure; female; human; Japan; Japanese (people); Review; risk assessment; urinalysis; urine level; animal; environmental monitoring; middle aged; pollutant; procedures; urine; Japan; Hexapoda; Mammalia; Adult; Aged; Animals; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Guanidines; Humans; Imidazoles; Insecticides; Japan; Middle Aged; Nitro Compounds; Organophosphates; Organophosphorus Compounds; Oxazines; Pyridines; Thiazines; Thiazoles",2-s2.0-84950104837

Most studies investigating carcinogenesis and the progression, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis of cancer have focused on alterations in cancer cells, including genetic and epigenetic changes. Recently, interactions between cancer cells and the stroma have attracted considerable attention, and increasing evidence has accumulated on this. Several researchers have gradually clarified the origins, features, and roles of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), a major component of the cancer stroma. CAFs function in a similar manner to myofibroblasts during wound healing. We previously reported the relationship between CAFs and angiogenesis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), a multifunctional cytokine, plays a central role in regulating inflammatory and immune responses, and important roles in the progression, including proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis, of several cancers. We showed that CAFs are an important IL-6 source and that anti-IL-6 receptor antibody suppressed angiogenesis and inhibited tumor-stroma interactions. Furthermore, CAFs contribute to drug-resistance acquisition in cancer cells. The interaction between cancer cells and the stroma could be a potential target for anti-cancer therapy. ? 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Angiogenesis; Cancer-associated fibroblasts; Drug resistance; Interleukin 6; Origin; Tumor-stroma interaction,fibroblast growth factor; interleukin 6; platelet derived growth factor; stromal cell derived factor 1; vasculotropin; adipocyte; bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cell; cancer associated fibroblast; cancer growth; cancer resistance; carcinogenesis; cell function; cell heterogeneity; cell metabolism; cell transformation; cellular distribution; disease marker; endothelial mesenchymal transition; epithelial mesenchymal transition; fibroblast; hematopoietic stem cell; human; malignant neoplastic disease; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; nonhuman; Review; target cell destruction,2-s2.0-84949775551

In this study, we delineated the current features andmanagement of ATL in Japan. The clinical data were collected retrospectively fromthemedical records of patientsdiagnosedwithATLbetween 2000 and2009, anda total of 1665 patients' records were submitted to the central office from 84 institutions in Japan. Seventy-one patients were excluded; 895, 355, 187, and 157 patients with acute, lymphoma, chronic, andsmoldering types, respectively, remained. Themedian survival timeswere 8.3, 10.6, 31.5, and 55.0 months, and 4-year overall survival (OS) rates were 11%, 16%, 36%, and 52%, respectively, for acute, lymphoma, chronic, and smoldering types. The number of patients with allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantation was 227, and their median survival timeandOSat 4 years after allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantationwas 5.9 months and 26%, respectively. This study revealed that the prognoses of the patients with acute and lymphoma types were still unsatisfactory, despite the recent progress in treatmentmodalities, but an improvement of 4-year OS was observed in comparisonwith the previous survey.

To identify factors predicting the duration of progression-free survival (PFS) of MM patients on BTZ treatment, the expression of proteasome and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related genes was quantified in primary samples from patients receiving a combination of BTZ and dexamethasone (BD). Fifty-six MM patients were stratified into a group with PFS<6 months (n=33) and a second group with PFS?6 months (n=23). Of the 15 genes analyzed, the expression of activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) and ATF4 was significantly lower in patients with shorter PFS (P=0.0157 and P=0.0085, respectively). Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that these ATFs bind each other and transactivate genes encoding the pro-apoptotic transcription factors, CHOP and Noxa, which promote ER stress-associated apoptosis. When either ATF3 or ATF4 expression was silenced, MM cells partially lost sensitivity to BTZ treatment. This was accompanied by lower levels of Noxa, CHOP and DR5. Thus low basal expression of ATF3 and ATF4 may attenuate BTZ-induced apoptosis. Hence, ATF3 and ATF4 could potentially be used as biomarkers to predict efficacy of BD therapy in patients with MM.",,"activating transcription factor 3; activating transcription factor 4; activating transcription factor 6; biological marker; bortezomib; dexamethasone; genomic DNA; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; lenalidomide; messenger RNA; microRNA; proteasome; protein Noxa; thalidomide; X box binding protein 1; activating transcription factor 3; activating transcription factor 4; biological marker; bortezomib; dexamethasone; messenger RNA; PMAIP1 protein, human; protein bcl 2; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand receptor; adult; aged; apoptosis; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer survival; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; correlation analysis; drug efficacy; endoplasmic reticulum stress; female; gene expression; human; human cell; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiple myeloma; progression free survival; promoter region; protein binding; protein expression; receiver operating characteristic; transactivation; upregulation; combination drug therapy; disease free survival; genetics; metabolism; multiple myeloma; tumor cell line; Activating Transcription Factor 3; Activating Transcription Factor 4; Apoptosis; Biomarkers; Bortezomib; Cell Line, Tumor; Dexamethasone; Disease-Free Survival; Drug Therapy, Combination; Humans; Multiple Myeloma; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Receptors, TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand; RNA, Messenger",2-s2.0-84949215128

Methods: A total of 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B who underwent IFN-α sequential therapy for cessation of NUC were enrolled retrospectively. The subjects received NUC plus IFN-α for 4weeks followed by IFN-α alone for 20weeks. Natural IFN-α of 6-MU doses was administrated three times a week. A successful response to NUC/IFN-α sequential therapy was defined as serum hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA below 4.0log copies/mL, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) below 30IU/L, and hepatitis B e-antigen negativity at 24months after completing the treatment. Results: Multivariate analysis revealed that hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) of 3.0logU/mL or more (P<0.002) and hepatitis B core-related antigen (hepatitis B core-related antigen [HBcrAg]) of 4.5logU/mL or more (P<0.003) at the start of IFN-α administration were significant factors associated with a 24-month non-response. Maximal levels of ALT and HBV DNA during the follow-up period after completing IFN-α therapy were significantly related (P<0.001), and receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that both maximal ALT (P<0.001) and HBV DNA (P<0.001) were significantly related to the final 24-month response. Conclusion: The combinational use of HBsAg and HBcrAg levels may be useful to predict the 24-month outcome of NUC/IFN-α sequential therapy. Maximal levels of ALT and HBV DNA during post-treatment follow-up may also help monitor responses to IFN-α sequential therapy. ? 2015 The Japan Society of Hepatology.",Hepatitis B core-related antigen; Hepatitis B surface antigen; Interferon-α; Nucleoside/nucleotide analogs; Sequential therapy,adefovir dipivoxil; alanine aminotransferase; alpha interferon; entecavir; hepatitis B core antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B(e) antigen; lamivudine; nucleoside derivative; nucleotide derivative; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; chronic hepatitis B; clinical article; controlled study; drug dose reduction; drug response; female; Hepatitis B virus genotype B; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; human; maintenance therapy; male; pilot study; priority journal; retrospective study; serology; treatment duration; treatment response; unspecified side effect; virus load,2-s2.0-84983573916

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has been structured for the three subtypes of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), but the number of impairment in social and communication dimension is not stated. Methods The subjects were 68 children who visited the Department of Psychology and Development at Nagoya City University Hospital for the first time between the ages of 6 and 15 years old. We retrospectively re-examined the subjects using DSM-IV-TR criteria and DSM-5 criteria with two rules (two of three and one of three on the social and communication dimension) and examined the concordance rate. Results Forty subjects were diagnosed with PDD, and 28 were not. The mean PDD subject age was 9.4 years, and mean IQ was 84.0 on the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children III or 62.7 on the Tanaka-Binet test. Twenty-seven (68%) of the PDD subjects were classified with ASD using DSM-5 criteria when the two of three rule was applied, while 32 (80%) were classified with ASD when the one of three rule was applied. All subjects without PDD were not diagnosed with ASD on DSM-5 criteria. Conclusion DSM-5 criteria may exclude high functioning and older subjects from ASD because they tend to be atypical. The diagnostic procedure for DSM-5 criteria is ambiguous, especially in high functioning subjects and those diagnosed at an older age. ? 2015 Japan Pediatric Society.",autism spectrum disorder; DSM-5; neurodevelopmental disorder; pervasive developmental disorder; social communication disorder,adolescent; algorithm; Article; autism; child; controlled study; disease classification; DSM-5; DSM-IV-TR; female; human; intelligence quotient; interpersonal communication; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; neurologic disease assessment; patient assessment; priority journal; retrospective study; social problem; social status; Tanaka Binet test; Wechsler intelligence scale for children; Autism Spectrum Disorder; classification; intelligence test; interpersonal communication; procedures; psychometry; Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Communication; Female; Humans; Intelligence Tests; Male; Psychometrics; Retrospective Studies,2-s2.0-84983109461

Methods: Records of a total of 27 patients (hematological malignancy, 14 patients; solid tumor, 13 patients) from 11 institutions who were diagnosed between June 2005 and October 2010 as having HBV reactivation following chemotherapy were reviewed. Results: Of the 27 patients with reactivation, 16 patients were hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) positive and 11 were HBsAg negative prior to the commencement of chemotherapy. Of the 11 patients who were HBsAg negative prior to the chemotherapy, 10 had hematological malignancies and one had a solid tumor. Of the 14 patients with hematological malignancies with HBV reactivation enrolled in the study, the reactivation occurred more than 12months after the completion of chemotherapy in five patients (36%); on the other hand, none of the patients (0%) with solid tumors developed HBV reactivation more than 12months after the completion of chemotherapy. Of the 24 patients who had acute liver dysfunction at the diagnosis of HBV reactivation, nine (38%) had severe hepatitis and seven (29%) died of liver failure. Conclusion: Most of the patients with HBV reactivation who were HBsAg negative prior to the chemotherapy had underlying hematological malignancies. Furthermore, patients with hematological malignancies often developed late-onset HBV reactivation. The prognosis of patients who develop acute liver dysfunction as a complication of HBV reactivation is extremely dismal. ? 2015 The Japan Society of Hepatology.",Case survey; Chemotherapy; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus DNA; Reactivation,cisplatin; cyclophosphamide; cytarabine; dexamethasone; doxorubicin; entecavir; epirubicin; fluorouracil; folinic acid; gemcitabine; gimeracil plus oteracil potassium plus tegafur; glycyrrhizic acid; idarubicin; irinotecan; lamivudine; melphalan; methotrexate; mitoxantrone; orantinib; oxaliplatin; pirarubicin; prednisolone; ranimustine; rituximab; temozolomide; thalidomide; UFT; unindexed drug; ursodeoxycholic acid; vincristine; acute hepatitis; acute myeloblastic leukemia; adult; aged; allogeneic stem cell transplantation; allogenic bone marrow transplantation; anorexia; antibody titer; Article; autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation; bile duct carcinoma; brain tumor; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; chemoembolization; clinical article; colorectal cancer; drowsiness; drug megadose; fatigue; female; fever; hematologic malignancy; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; jaundice; liver cell carcinoma; liver dysfunction; liver metastasis; lung cancer; lymphoma; malaise; male; medical record review; multicenter study; multiple myeloma; nausea and vomiting; pancreas cancer; priority journal; prognosis; retrospective study; solid tumor; somnolence; stomach cancer; symptom; very elderly; virus load; virus reactivation,2-s2.0-84955691370

We examined whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of BMAL1 and BMAL2 were associated with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) in the general Japanese population. Methods: We studied 2467 subjects (1232 men and 1235 women, 35-69 years old), including 105 men and 57 women with T2DM, from the participants of the Japan Multi-institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. The association between SNPs in the BMAL1 (rs11022775 and rs2290035) and BMAL2 (rs7958822) genes and T2DM were analyzed by multiple logistic regression after adjustment for potential confounders. Analysis was also performed after stratification by body mass index (?25kg/m2 and &lt;25kg/m2) to investigate an interaction between genotypes and obesity. Results: The A/G and A/A genotypes of BMAL2 rs7958822 showed significantly higher adjusted odds ratios (OR) for T2DM than the G/G genotype among obese men (OR = 2.2, 95% confidence intervals [CI] 1.1, 4.6, P for interaction = 0.0495) and obese women (OR = 2.7, 95% CI 1.1, 6.7, P for interaction = 0.199).

Differences in tumor behavior, which ultimately reflects clinical outcome, can be explained by variations in gene expression patterns generated by epigenetic mechanisms, such as DNA methylation. Therefore, epigenetic abnormalities are considered potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets. DNA methylation is stable at certain specific loci in cancer cells and predominantly reflects the characteristic clinicopathological features. Thus, it is an ideal biomarker for cancer screening, classification and prognostic purposes. Epigenetic treatment for cancers is based on the pharmacologic targeting of various core transcriptional programs that sustains cancer cell identity. Therefore, targeting aberrant epigenetic modifiers may be effective for multiple processes compared with using a selective inhibitor of aberrant single signaling pathway. This review provides an overview of the epigenetic alterations in human cancers and discusses about novel therapeutic strategies targeting epigenetic alterations. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Biomarker; DNA methylation; Epigenetic therapy; Histone modification; Liquid biopsy,"Alkylation; Biomarkers; Diagnosis; DNA; Gene expression; Methylation; Tumors; DNA Methylation; Epigenetic alterations; Epigenetic mechanisms; Epigenetic therapy; Gene expression patterns; Histone modification; Selective inhibitors; Transcriptional program; Diseases; azacitidine; bromodomain inhibitor; cell free DNA; DNA; DNA methyltransferase inhibitor; glutathione transferase P1; histone deacetylase inhibitor; isocitrate dehydrogenase 1; methylated DNA protein cysteine methyltransferase; pinometostat; Ras association domain family protein 1A; retinoic acid; septin; septin 9; tamoxifen; tazemetostat; temozolomide; transcription factor EZH2; tranylcypromine; unclassified drug; biological marker; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloblastic leukemia; adjuvant therapy; Article; B cell lymphoma; bladder cancer; breast cancer; cancer diagnosis; cancer genetics; cancer prognosis; cancer screening; colorectal cancer; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; differential diagnosis; DNA methylation; epigenetics; feces analysis; glioma; histone modification; human; mutational analysis; myelodysplastic syndrome; next generation sequencing; non small cell lung cancer; nonhuman; peripheral T cell lymphoma; personalized medicine; priority journal; solid tumor; treatment response; urinalysis; clinical medicine; genetic epigenesis; genetics; Neoplasms; Biomarkers; Clinical Medicine; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Humans; Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84955197707

This study aimed to examine the effect of pretreatment patient characteristics on response to PPI therapy. Methods: Japanese outpatients with symptomatic GERD scheduled to receive endoscopy and PPI therapy were enrolled in this multicenter prospective observational study. The patients’ characteristics, including GERD and dyspeptic symptoms, anxiety, depression, and quality of life, were assessed using questionnaires before and 2 and 4?weeks after the start of PPI therapy. Factors affecting therapeutic response were examined by simple and multiple regression analyses using three patient-reported outcome measures as objective variables. Results: Data from 182 patients were analyzed. In multiple regression analysis using the residual symptom rate as an objective variable, lower GERD symptom score (p?<?0.05), absence of erosive esophagitis (p?<?0.05), higher epigastric pain/burning symptom score (p?<?0.05), and higher depression subscale score (p?<?0.05) accompanied poorer therapeutic response. In analyses using the patient’s impression of therapy, lower GERD symptom score (p?<?0.05) and absence of erosive esophagitis (p?<?0.05) accompanied poorer therapeutic response. In analyses using the relative GERD symptom intensity evaluated using a numeric rating scale, lower GERD symptom score (p?<?0.05), higher epigastric pain/burning symptom score (p?<?0.1), and lower body mass index (p?<?0.05) accompanied poorer therapeutic response. Conclusions: Patients who complained of milder GERD symptoms before treatment were likely to have poorer response to PPI therapy. Association of absence of erosive esophagitis, severer epigastric pain/burning symptoms, lower body mass index, and severer depression with poorer therapeutic response was also suggested. ? 2015, Springer Japan.",Anxiety; Depression; Dyspeptic symptoms; Gastroesophageal reflux disease; Therapeutic response to proton pump inhibitor therapy,proton pump inhibitor; proton pump inhibitor; adult; Article; body mass; depression; endoscopy; epigastric pain; female; gastroesophageal reflux; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; irritable colon; major clinical study; male; multiple regression; non erosive reflux disease; observational study; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; questionnaire; rating scale; reflux esophagitis; treatment response; age distribution; aged; anxiety; clinical trial; dyspepsia; gastroesophageal reflux; middle aged; multicenter study; patient satisfaction; psychology; severity of illness index; sex ratio; treatment outcome; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Anxiety; Depression; Dyspepsia; Female; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Prospective Studies; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Distribution; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84949532753

The aim of this study is to estimate the current risk of thromboembolism among COC users in Japan. Methods We used the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) database disclosed by PMDA from April 2004 to December 2013, and extracted thromboembolic events among adverse events from the adverse event information of COC products. Results Of the 581 thromboembolic events, venous thromboembolism (VTE) accounted for 394 events, arterial embolism and thrombosis (ATE) were 154, and thrombosis of unspecified sites was 33. In VTE, deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism were the most frequent (78.4%), followed by cerebral vein thrombosis (11.4%). In ATE, cerebral infarction was the most frequent (76.0%) and approximately 6.9-fold higher than coronary heart diseases. The annual estimated incidence per 10,000 person-years of VTE, ATE and all thromboembolisms in current users of all COCs were 1.11 (95% confidence interval: 1.00-1.24), 0.37 (0.30-0.44), and 1.56 (1.42-1.71), respectively. The frequency of all thromboembolic events that developed within 90 days from the start of COCs was 45.5%, and that within 360 days was 81.2%. Sixteen deceased cases were suspected to be associated with thromboembolism, and the estimated mortality rate between 2009 and 2013 was 0.50 (0.30-0.84) per 100,000 person-years. Conclusions Incidence rates of thromboembolism, particularly VTE, in Japanese current COC users became clear for the first time, being slightly lower than people in Western countries. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the stiffness of these thickened capsules has not been reported. Shear-wave ultrasound elastography is a new technology that can measure tissue elasticity quantitatively. Hypothesis: The posterior and posteroinferior capsules are stiffer as well as thicker in the throwing shoulders of baseball players than in their nonthrowing shoulders. The thickness and elasticity of these capsules are inversely correlated with glenohumeral internal rotation. Study Design: Cross-sectional study; Level of evidence, 3. Methods: Forty-five male college baseball players were examined. The thickness and elasticity of the posterior capsule beneath the infraspinatus and the posteroinferior capsule beneath the teres minor were measured using an ultrasonic device equipped with shear-wave elastographic technology. Glenohumeral internal rotation at 90° of shoulder abduction and humeral retrotorsion were also measured. Results: The mean thickness and elasticity of the posterior capsule were significantly greater for the throwing compared with the nonthrowing shoulder (thickness: 1.34 vs 1.04 mm, respectively; elasticity: 40.0 vs 32.2 kPa, respectively; P <.001 for both). The mean thickness and elasticity of the posteroinferior capsule were also significantly greater in the throwing compared with the nonthrowing shoulder (thickness: 1.40 vs 1.04 mm, respectively; elasticity: 39.4 vs 31.6 kPa, respectively; P <.001 for both). After correcting the range of motion for bilateral differences in retrotorsion, correlation coefficients showed that posterior capsule thickness and elasticity (Pearson r = -0.43 and -0.56, respectively; P <.001 for both) and posteroinferior capsule thickness and elasticity (Pearson r = -0.51 and -0.52, respectively; P <.001 for both) were negatively correlated with the corrected glenohumeral internal rotation. Bilateral differences in posterior and posteroinferior capsule elasticity correlated with bilateral differences in the corrected glenohumeral internal rotation (Pearson r = 0.46 [P =.0015] and 0.48 [P <.001], respectively), whereas bilateral differences in posterior and posteroinferior capsule thickness did not (Pearson r = -0.13 [P =.38] and 0.17 [P =.28], respectively). Conclusion: The posterior and posteroinferior capsules were stiffer as well as thicker in the throwing shoulder of college baseball players compared with the nonthrowing shoulder. Posterior capsule elasticity appeared to have a greater effect on GIRD than did posterior capsule thickness. This technology could be used as a noninvasive screening method for throwing athletes to identify players at potential risk of shoulder injuries. ? 2015 The Author(s).",baseball; glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD); posterior capsule of the shoulder; shoulder; ultrasound elastography,"athlete; baseball; cross-sectional study; echography; elastography; human; humerus; injuries; joint characteristics and functions; male; physiology; rotator cuff; shoulder; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Athletes; Baseball; Cross-Sectional Studies; Elasticity Imaging Techniques; Humans; Humerus; Male; Range of Motion, Articular; Rotator Cuff; Shoulder; Shoulder Joint; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84949036155

Objectives The aim of this study was to evaluate the following hypotheses: 1) cancer patients' depressive symptoms decrease with age, and 2) in individuals aged 65 years or older, depressive symptoms increase because of the effect of somatic symptoms. Methods We retrospectively analyzed a database of 356 cancer patients who were consecutively recruited in a previous multicenter cross-sectional study. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and correlations with age and other factors were assessed by hierarchical multivariate regression analysis. Age was entered as the dependent variable in the first step, patient characteristics and cancer-related variables were entered in the second step, and somatic symptoms were entered in the last step. We analyzed this model for both the total sample and the subpopulation aged 65 years or older. Results In the total sample, the PHQ-9 score was significantly associated with lower age, fatigue, and shortness of breath (adjusted R2 14.2%). In the subpopulation aged 65 years or older, no factor was associated with the PHQ-9 score (adjusted R2 7.3%). Conclusion The finding that depressive symptoms in cancer patients decreased with age was concordant with our first hypothesis, but the second hypothesis was not supported. Younger cancer patients were vulnerable to depressive symptoms and should be monitored carefully. Further studies using more representative samples are needed to examine in detail the association between depressive symptoms and age in older cancer patients. ? 2015 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine.

The authors herein verified this system for clinical application. Methods: The authors prepared four types of patient-specific aperture systems equipped with an energy absorber to irradiate shallow regions less than 4 g/cm2. The aperture was made of 3-cm-thick brass and the maximum water equivalent penetration to be used with this system was estimated to be 15 g/cm2. The authors measured in-air lateral profiles at the isocenter plane and integral depth doses with the energy absorber. All input data were obtained by the Monte Carlo calculation, and its parameters were tuned to reproduce measurements. The fluence of single spots in water was modeled as a triple Gaussian function and the dose distribution was calculated using a fluence dose model. The authors compared in-air and in-water lateral profiles and depth doses between calculations and measurements for various apertures of square, half, and U-shaped fields. The absolute doses and dose distributions with the aperture were then validated by patient-specific quality assurance. Measured data were obtained by various chambers and a 2D ion chamber detector array. Results: The patient-specific aperture reduced the penumbra from 30% to 70%, for example, from 34.0 to 23.6 mm and 18.8 to 5.6 mm. The calculated field width for square-shaped apertures agreed with measurements within 1 mm. Regarding patient-specific aperture plans, calculated and measured doses agreed within -0.06%±0.63% (mean±SD) and 97.1% points passed the 2%-dose/2 mmdistance criteria of the γ-index on average. Conclusions: The patient-specific aperture system improved dose distributions, particularly in shallow-region plans. ? 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",aperture; commissioning; lateral penumbra; proton beam; spot scanning,Article; energy absorption; geometry; irradiation; Monte Carlo method; normal distribution; proton radiation; quality control; radiation absorption; radiation dose distribution; air; devices; equipment design; human; personalized medicine; procedures; proton therapy; radiometry; radiotherapy dosage; validation study; proton; water; Air; Equipment Design; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Precision Medicine; Proton Therapy; Protons; Radiometry; Radiotherapy Dosage; Water,2-s2.0-84947104351

However, GMA treatment could be discontinued when CDAI decreased to <150 (clinical remission level). Results: Of the 104 patients, 99 were available for efficacy evaluation as per protocol, 45 in the weekly GMA group, and 54 in the intensive GMA group. Remission was achieved in 16 of 45 patients (35.6 %) in the weekly GMA and in 19 of 54 (35.2 %) in the intensive GMA (NS). Further, the mean time to remission was 35.4 ± 5.3 days in the weekly GMA and 21.7 ± 2.7 days in the intensive GMA (P = 0.0373). Elevated leucocytes and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were significantly improved by intensive GMA, from 8005/μL to 6950/μL (P = 0.0461) and from 54.5 mm/hr to 30.0 mm/hr (P = 0.0059), respectively. In both arms, GMA was well tolerated and was without safety concern. Conclusions: In this study, with respect to remission rate, intensive GMA was not superior to weekly GMA, but the time to remission was significantly shorter in the former without increasing the incidence of side effects.

FBPase deficiency is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder, characterized by episodic attacks of hypoglycemia, ketosis, and lactic acidosis during fasting. In general, urinary organic acid analysis using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) is very useful for the diagnosis of FBPase deficiency, because the appearance of glycerol or glycerol-3-phosphate in the urine is characteristic of this disease. Here, we report a case of FBPase deficiency in a girl with a history of several severe lactic acidosis events, both as a neonate and after the age of 12 months. The patient was identified as a compound heterozygote with two mutations in the FBPase 1 gene: c.841G>A (p.Glu281Lys) and c.960_961insG (p.Ser321fs). The c.841G>A is a newly identified pathogenic mutation. An abnormal level of glycerol-3-phosphate was not detected in the conventional urinary organic acid analysis using GC/MS after solvent extraction. This method, which is a widely used diagnostic standard, could not detect increased levels of glycerol or glycerol-3-phosphate in the patient’s urine, which was sampled during the episode. However, glycerol and glycerol-3-phosphate were detected in the same sample, when it was analyzed using GC/MS with the urease pretreatment non-extraction method. Patients with FBPase deficiency have good glycemic control after correct treatment. Therefore, accurate and early diagnosis is essential for a good prognosis. Accordingly, when a patient presents with hypoglycemia and lactic acidosis, it is important to select the appropriate method of urinalysis for organic acids by GC/MS. ? 2015 Tohoku University Medical Press.","Fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase deficiency; GC/MS analysis; Gluconeogenesis; Hypoglycemia; Lactic acidosis","biotin; carnitine; cyanocobalamin; fructose bisphosphatase; glycerol; glycerophosphate; ketone body; pyruvic acid; thiamine; alpha-glycerophosphoric acid; glycerol; glycerophosphate; solvent; Article; case report; child; continuous hemodiafiltration; drug withdrawal; enzyme deficiency; female; fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase deficiency; fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase gene; gene mutation; glycemic control; heterozygote; human; hypertransaminasemia; hypoglycemia; ketoacidosis; lactic acidosis; mass fragmentography; newborn; preschool child; solvent extraction; urinalysis; chemistry; Fructose-1,6-Diphosphatase Deficiency; mass fragmentography; metabolism; urine; Female; Fructose-1,6-Diphosphatase Deficiency; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Glycerol; Glycerophosphates; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Solvents",2-s2.0-84946893346

Methods: Patients with newly diagnosed MPA and GPA were enrolled in a nationwide, prospective, inception cohort study from 22 tertiary Japanese institutions, and treatment patterns and responses were evaluated for 24 months. Primary outcome measures were rates of remission (Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score, 0) and remission with low-dose glucocorticoids (GC) (prednisolone ? 10 mg) (GC remission). Results: Of 156 enrolled patients, 78 MPA patients and 33 GPA patients were included. Concomitant cyclophosphamide (CY) was used in 24 MPA (31 %) and 20 GPA (60 %) patients during the initial 3 weeks of treatment. After 6 months, remission was achieved in 66 MPA (85 %) and 29 GPA (87 %) patients, while GC remission was obtained in only 31 MPA (40 %) and 13 GPA (39 %) patients. During the 24-month period, 14 MPA patients and 2 GPA patients died; end stage renal disease (ESRD) was noted in 13 MPA patients but no GPA patients. Patients with severe disease, according to the European Vasculitis Study Group (EUVAS) classification, showed poorer ESRD-free and overall survival rates than those with generalized disease (p < 0.0001). There were no differences in relapse-free survival rates between GPA and MPA, among EUVAS-defined disease severity categories, and between anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody subspecialties. Conclusions: The majority of Japanese patients with MPA and GPA received treatment with high-dose GC and limited CY use, and showed high remission and relapse-free survival rates but low GC remission rates in clinical practice.

Objective We sought to characterize the genetic cause and clinical spectrum of Hz/Hc. Methods Proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1 (PSTPIP1) gene sequencing was performed in 14 patients with Hz/Hc, and their clinical phenotype was compared with that of 11 patients with pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA) syndrome. PSTPIP1-pyrin interactions were analyzed by means of immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. A structural model of the PSTPIP1 dimer was generated. Cytokine profiles were analyzed by using the multiplex immunoassay, and MRP8/14 serum concentrations were analyzed by using an ELISA. Results Thirteen patients were heterozygous for a missense mutation in the PSTPIP1 gene, resulting in a p.E250K mutation, and 1 carried a mutation resulting in p.E257K. Both mutations substantially alter the electrostatic potential of the PSTPIP1 dimer model in a region critical for protein-protein interaction. Patients with Hz/Hc have extremely high MRP8/14 concentrations (2045 ± 1300 μg/mL) compared with those with PAPA syndrome (116 ± 74 μg/mL) and have a distinct clinical phenotype. A specific cytokine profile is associated with Hz/Hc. Hz/Hc mutations altered protein binding of PSTPIP1, increasing interaction with pyrin through phosphorylation of PSTPIP1. Conclusion Mutations resulting in charge reversal in the y-domain of PSTPIP1 (E→K) and increased interaction with pyrin cause a distinct autoinflammatory disorder defined by clinical and biochemical features not found in patients with PAPA syndrome, indicating a unique genotype-phenotype correlation for mutations in the PSTPIP1 gene. This is the first inborn autoinflammatory syndrome in which inflammation is driven by uncontrolled release of members of the alarmin family. ? 2015 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology","autoinflammation; calprotectin; genotype; Hyperzincemia and hypercalprotectinemia; myeloid-related protein 8/14; phenotype; proline-serine-threonine phosphatase-interacting protein 1; pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne syndrome; S100 proteins; zinc","amino acid; calgranulin; calgranulin A; calgranulin B; CXCL9 chemokine; eotaxin; granulocyte antibody; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 15; interleukin 17; interleukin 18; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 21; interleukin 22; interleukin 33; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; macrophage derived chemokine; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; myeloid related protein 14; myeloid related protein 8; proline serine threonine phosphatase interacting protein 1; thymus and activation regulated chemokine; unclassified drug; alarmin; calgranulin; calgranulin A; cytokine; cytoskeleton protein; marenostrin; protein binding; PSTPIP1 protein, human; signal transducing adaptor protein; adolescent; adult; Article; autoinflammatory disease; child; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; dermatitis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; failure to thrive; female; gene mutation; hepatosplenomegaly; human; hypercalprotectinemia; hyperzincemia; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; laboratory test; lymphadenopathy; male; PAPA syndrome; phenotype; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; sequence alignment; Western blotting; disorders of metal metabolism; genetics; genotype; immunology; metabolism; missense mutation; phosphorylation; protein multimerization; protein protein interaction; young adult; Adaptor Proteins, Signal Transducing; Adolescent; Alarmins; Calgranulin A; Child; Cytokines; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Female; Genotype; Humans; Leukocyte L1 Antigen Complex; Male; Metal Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Mutation, Missense; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Protein Interaction Maps; Protein Multimerization; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85028275682

The standard method of serotyping of pneumococcal isolates is the phenotypic Neufeld test, which is cost- and labor-intensive. Recently, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been implemented as a rapid, simple and inexpensive method for identifying species. We evaluated the performance of MALDI-TOF MS for serotyping ten major serotypes of S. pneumoniae in Japan (serotypes 3, 6B, 15A, 15C, 19A, 19?F, 23A, 24?F, 35B and 38) using the Biotyper and ClinProTools. After optimizing the settings, we validated their serotyping performance for serotypes 3, 15A and 19A using a separate set of isolates that were not used in the creation of the classification algorithms. A total of 574 isolates of S. pneumoniae collected from Japanese nationwide surveillance studies were included. Of these, 407 isolates belonged to the ten major serotypes. Biotyper and ClinProTools correctly identified 77.9?% and 84.0?%, respectively, of the ten major serotype isolates. The validation analysis included a total of 113 isolates of the serotypes 3, 15A and 19A isolates.

Here, a block copolymer used as a medical additive, Poloxamer 188 (P188), was incorporated into liposome membranes, and the thermosensitive characteristics of the DPPC/P188 hybrid liposomes were assessed. An increase in P188 incorporation in DPPC liposomes enhanced the release of calcein, a fluorescence marker, from liposomes at 42°C in vitro; calcein release was significantly slower at 37°C. The lipid composition was optimal at a DPPC/P188 ratio of 3:0.4 (molar ratio). DPPC/P188 liposomes did not exhibit in vitro cytotoxicity against A549 cells and Raw 264.7 cells used as models of pulmonary cells or trigger in vivo acute inflammation as determined by the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha. Next, an anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), was loaded with approximately 90% efficiency into DPPC/P188 liposomes using a remote-loading method and a DOX-phospholipid ratio of 1:20 (w/w). The interior buffer of liposome has remarkably changed DOX release at 42°C. DOX released from DPPC/P188 liposomes at 42°C exhibited cytotoxic effects toward A549 cells comparable with free DOX solution.

We found that the methyl 13 C chemical shifts of the M230 resonance of HIV-1 RT bound to these drugs exhibited a high correlation with their anti-HIV-1 RT activities. This methionine residue is located in proximity to the NNRTI-binding pocket but not directly involved in drug interactions and serves as a conformational probe, indicating that the open conformation of HIV-1 RT was more populated with NNRTIs with higher inhibitory activities. Thus, the NMR approach offers a useful tool to screen for novel NNRTIs in developing anti-HIV drugs.",,"protein binding; reverse transcriptase, Human immunodeficiency virus 1; RNA directed DNA polymerase; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; antagonists and inhibitors; binding site; chemistry; enzymology; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; nuclear magnetic resonance; Binding Sites; HIV Reverse Transcriptase; HIV-1; Humans; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Protein Binding; Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors",2-s2.0-84946129824

Methods: Retrospective chart review of patients who underwent fundus examination including en face OCTA. Eyes with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and history of laser photocoagulation were excluded. The FAZ area in the superficial and deep plexus layers were measured and evaluated using ImageJ software. Results: The FAZ area in the superficial layer was 0.25 ± 0.06 mm2 in healthy eyes (n = 19), whereas it was 0.37 ± 0.07 mm2 in diabetic eyes without retinopathy (n = 24) and 0.38 ± 0.11 mm2 in eyes with diabetic retinopathy (n = 20). Diabetic eyes showed statistically significant FAZ enlargement compared with healthy eyes, regardless of the presence of retinopathy (P &lt; 0.01). The FAZ area in the deep plexus layer was also significantly larger in diabetic eyes than in healthy eyes (P &lt; 0.01). Conclusion: Our data suggest that diabetic eyes show retinal microcirculation impairment in the macula even before retinopathy develops. En face OCTA is a useful noninvasive screening tool for detecting early microcirculatory disturbance in patients with diabetes.

Methods and Materials: Fifty-five patients underwent this procedure as an interventional treatment. Five patients had 2 tumors, and 4 tumors required 2 markers each, so the total number of procedures was 64. The 60 tumors consisted of 46 hepatocellular carcinomas and 14 liver metastases. Five-mm-long straight microcoils of 0.018 inches in diameter were used as fiducial markers and placed in appropriate positions for each tumor. We assessed the technical and clinical success rates of transarterial fiducial marker placement, as well as the complications associated with it. Technical success was defined as the successful delivery and placement of the fiducial coil, and clinical success was defined as the completion of proton therapy. Results: All 64 fiducial coils were successfully installed, so the technical success rate was 100?% (64/64). Fifty-four patients underwent proton therapy without coil migration. In one patient, proton therapy was not performed because of obstructive jaundice due to bile duct invasion by hepatocellular carcinoma. Thus, the clinical success rate was 98?% (54/55). Slight bleeding was observed in one case, but it was stopped immediately and then observed. None of the patients developed hepatic infarctions due to fiducial marker migration. Conclusion: Transarterial fiducial marker placement appears to be a useful and safe procedure for proton therapy for malignant liver tumors. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",Fiducial marker; Proton therapy; Transarterial,"adult; aged; Article; bleeding; computed tomographic angiography; embolization coil; female; fiducial marker; human; imaging; liver cancer; liver cell carcinoma; liver metastasis; major clinical study; male; microcatheter; priority journal; proton therapy; transarterial fiducial marker placement; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; computer assisted tomography; feasibility study; interventional radiology; liver; Liver Neoplasms; middle aged; radiography; retrospective study; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Feasibility Studies; Female; Fiducial Markers; Humans; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Proton Therapy; Radiography, Interventional; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84941424290

Oxaliplatin (L-OHP) is a platinum-based anticancer drug used to treat colorectal, pancreatic, and stomach cancers. However, it often causes acute and chronic peripheral neuropathies including cold allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia. In this study, we investigated the preventive effects of NYT on neuronal degeneration caused by L-OHP using PC12 cells, which are derived from the rat adrenal medulla and differentiate into nerve-like cells after exposure to nerve growth factor. L-OHP treatment decreased the elongation of neurite-like projection outgrowths in differentiated PC12 cells. When PC12 cells were treated with NYT hot water extract, neurodegeneration caused by L-OHP was significantly prevented in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the 12 crude drugs composing NYT, the extract of Ginseng (the root of Panax ginseng) exhibited the strongest preventive effects on neurodegeneration in differentiated PC12 cells. By activity-guided fractionation, we found that the fraction containing ginsenosides displayed preventive activity and, among several ginsenosides, ginsenoside F2 exhibited significant preventive effects on L-OHP-induced decreases in neurite-like outgrowths in differentiated PC12 cells.

ABCA7 has been shown to mediate phagocytosis and affect membrane trafficking. The current study examined the impact of ABCA7 loss of function on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and generation of amyloid-β (Aβ). Suppression of endogenous ABCA7 in several different cell lines resulted in increased β-secretase cleavage and elevated Aβ. ABCA7 knock-out mice displayed an increased production of endogenous murine amyloid Aβ42 species. Crossing ABCA7-deficient animals to an APP transgenic model resulted in significant increases in the soluble Aβas compared with mice expressing normal levels of ABCA7. Only modest changes in the amount of insoluble Aβ and amyloid plaque densities were observed once the amyloid pathology was well developed, whereas Aβ deposition was enhanced in younger animals. In vitro studies indicated a more rapid endocytosis of APP in ABCA7 knock-out cells that is mechanistically consistent with the increased Aβ production. These in vitro and in vivo findings indicate a direct role of ABCA7 in amyloid processing that may be associated with its primary biological function to regulate endocytic pathways. Several potential loss-of-function ABCA7 mutations and deletions linked to Alzheimer disease that in some instances have a greater impact than apoE allelic variants have recently been identified. A reduction in ABCA7 expression or loss of function would be predicted to increase amyloid production and that may be a contributing factor in the associated Alzheimer disease susceptibility. ? 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Animals; Antigen-antibody reactions; Bins; Cell culture; Diseases; Mammals; Molecular biology; Neurodegenerative diseases; Alzheimer disease; Amyloid precursor proteins; ATP binding cassette transporters; Biological functions; Contributing factor; Endocytic pathways; Genome-wide association studies; Membrane trafficking; Glycoproteins; ABC transporter; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; amyloid precursor protein; ATP binding cassette transporter A7; beta secretase; unclassified drug; ABC transporter; ABCA7 protein, human; Abca7 protein, mouse; amyloid beta protein; secretase; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; embryo; endocytosis; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; knockout mouse; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein function; protein processing; Alzheimer disease; animal; C3H mouse; C57BL mouse; chemistry; disease course; disease model; endosome; female; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; HEK293 cell line; HeLa cell line; male; metabolism; mutation; risk factor; RNA interference; transgenic mouse; tumor cell line; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Animals; ATP-Binding Cassette Transporters; Cell Line, Tumor; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Endosomes; Female; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C3H; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation; Risk Factors; RNA Interference",2-s2.0-84943279590

The malarial parasite grows and reproduces in erythrocytes during its life cycle, resulting in programmed erythrocyte death, termed eryptosis. Lipid scrambling, which occurs following the exposure of anionic lipids such as phosphatidylserine (PS) on the outer surface of erythrocytes, is a characteristic physical change that occurs early during eryptosis. Here, we prepared ""PS specific peptide (PSP)""-conjugated liposomes (PSP-liposomes) and investigated whether PSP-liposomes hold promise as a novel strategy for actively targeting eryptosis. Eryptosis was induced by exposing red blood cells (RBCs) to ionomycin, a known calcium ionophore. When PSP liposomes were mixed with either RBCs or RBCs undergoing eryptosis (E-RBCs), the amount of PSP-liposome bound to E-RBCs was much higher than the amount bound to RBCs. However, the amount of PSP-liposome bound to E-RBCs was significantly inhibited by the presence of annexin V protein, which binds specifically to PS. These results suggest that PSP-liposomes could be an effective drug nanocarrier for treating E-RBCs and malaria-infected erythrocytes. ? 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Eryptosis; Liposome; Malaria; Phosphatidylserine; Targeting,"ionomycin; lipocortin 5; liposome; nanocarrier; phosphatidylserine; phosphatidylserine specific peptide conjugated liposome; unclassified drug; lipid; liposome; peptide; apoptosis; Article; binding site; cellular parameters; controlled study; eryptosis; erythrocyte; erythrocyte membrane; fluorescence; malaria; male; mouse; nonhuman; protein lipid interaction; target cell; animal; chemistry; disease model; drug effects; erythrocyte; malaria; parasitology; Plasmodium; Animals; Apoptosis; Disease Models, Animal; Erythrocytes; Lipids; Liposomes; Malaria; Male; Mice; Peptides; Plasmodium",2-s2.0-84946732235

KW-0761 is a humanized anti-human CCR4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that has antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity. Depletion of CCR4-expressing FoxP3+ CD4 Tregs by KW-0761 infusion was investigated in solid cancer patients. Experimental Design: We conducted a phase Ia clinical trial of KW-0761 infusion in 7 lung and 3 esophageal cancer patients. Toxicity, clinical efficacy, changes in lymphocyte subpopulations, includingTregs,andinductionofimmune responseswereanalyzed. Results: The results showed that KW-0761 infusion in a dose range between0.1mg/kg and 1.0mg/kgwas safe andwell tolerated. Nodose-limiting toxicitywas observed. Four of 10 patients showed stable disease during treatment and were long survivors. The monitoring of FoxP3+ Tregs in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells during treatment indicated efficient depletion of those cells, even at the lowest dose of 0.1 mg/kg used. The reduction in Th 1 CD4 T cells and CD8 T cells was limited, whereas a significant reduction was observed with Th 2 and Th 17 CD4 T cells. Immune responses to cancer/testis (CT) antigens and an autoantibody response to thyroid peroxidase were observed in some patients. Conclusions: The findings showed Tregs depletion and the possible occurrence of an immune response following KW-0761 infusion.

Methods: Patients aged ?65 years with incurable lung or gastroenterological cancer and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 2 or greater were continuously sampled after admission to a university hospital. Participants were evaluated for DSM-IV-TR delirium by trained psychiatrists and the delirium subtype was assessed using the Delirium Motor Subtype Scale within 4 days after admission and again 2 weeks later. In addition, we assessed associated factors with delirium on admission. Results: Among 73 eligible patients, complete data were available from 61 on admission and 49 after 2 weeks. Twenty-six patients (43%) met delirium criteria on admission (hypoactive: 58%, unspecified: 35%, hyperactive: 4%, mixed: 4%). Of these, 19 (73%) remained delirious 2 weeks later. Of 35 patients without delirium on admission, 21 (60%) remained delirium-free 2 weeks later and 7(20%) became delirious. Overall, 33/61 (54%) developed delirium at some point during the study. Patients receiving steroids at admission were more likely to have delirium (odds ratio = 5.0; 95% confidence interval = 1.5-16). Conclusions: Given the high prevalence of the delirium, all patients with advanced cancer should be screened for delirium both on admission and regularly thereafter. In addition, medical staff should be aware that steroid use on admission is an additional indicator of elevated risk for delirium. ?

Results: Complete datawere available for 146 of the patients, and 14%of themsuffered fromclinical anxiety. Anxiety score had a statistically significant correlation with all domains of quality-of-life measures. The only perceived need that was significantly associated with anxiety was the psychological domain. Conclusions: Not negligible patients may suffer from clinical anxiety >2 years after their initial cancer diagnoses. Anxiety can impact on patients' quality of life, and unmet psychological needs are expected to increase anxiety levels. Management of anxiety could be one of the key components to improving the quality of life for breast cancer survivors and that reducing their unmet psychological needs may contribute to alleviating anxiety. ?

However, both viruses often acquire NRTI resistance, making it crucial to develop more-potent agents that offer profound viral suppression. Here, we report that 4′-C-cyano-2-amino-2′-deoxyadenosine (CAdA) is a novel, highly potent inhibitor of both HBV (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50]=0.4 nM) and HIV-1 (IC50=0.4 nM). In contrast, the approved anti-HBV NRTI, entecavir (ETV), potently inhibits HBV (IC50=0.7 nM), but is much less active against HIV-1 (IC50=1,000 nM). Similarly, the highly potent HIV-1 inhibitor, 4′-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2′-deoxyadenosine (EFdA; IC50=0.3 nM) is less active against HBV (IC50=160 nM). Southern analysis using Huh-7 cells transfected with HBV-containing plasmids demonstrated that CAdA was potent against both wild-type (IC50=7.2 nM) and ETV-resistant HBV (IC50=69.6 nM for HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V), whereas ETV failed to reduce HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V DNA even at 1 μM. Once-daily peroral administration of CAdA reduced HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V viremia (P=0.0005) in human-liver-chimeric/ HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V-infected mice, whereas ETV completely failed to reduce HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V viremia. None of the mice had significant drug-related body-weight or serum human-albumin concentration changes. Molecular modeling suggests that a shallower HBV-RT hydrophobic pocket at the polymerase active site can better accommodate the slightly shorter 4′-cyano of CAdA-triphosphate (TP), but not the longer 4′-ethynyl of EFdA-TP. In contrast, the deeper HIV-1-RT pocket can efficiently accommodate the 4′-substitutions of both NRTIs. The ETV-TP's cyclopentyl ring can bind more efficiently at the shallow HBV-RT binding pocket. Conclusion: These data provide insights on the structural and functional associations of HBV- and HIV-1-RTs and show that CAdA may offer new therapeutic options for HBV patients. ? 2015 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,"4' c cyano 2 amino 2' deoxyadenosine; antivirus agent; entecavir; nucleoside analog; serum albumin; unclassified drug; 4'-C-cyano-2-amino-2'-deoxyadenosine; deoxyadenosine derivative; entecavir; guanine; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; drug binding; drug potency; drug structure; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; human cell; IC50; molecular model; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; viremia; virus inhibition; analogs and derivatives; animal; antiviral resistance; drug effects; Hepatitis B virus; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Animals; Deoxyadenosines; Drug Resistance, Viral; Guanine; Hepatitis B virus; HIV-1; Mice",2-s2.0-84942551464

We showed previously that removal of a region in domain 2 (D2) of NS5A (mutant NS5AD2Δ) is dispensable for viral replication in hepatoma cell lines. By using a mouse model and immune-competent cell systems, we studied the role of D2 in controlling the innate immune response. Methods In vivo replication competence of NS5AD2Δ was studied in transgenic mice with human liver xenografts. Results were validated using primary human hepatocytes (PHHs) and mechanistic analyses were conducted in engineered Huh7 hepatoma cells with reconstituted innate signaling pathways. Results Although the deletion in NS5A removed most of the interferon (IFN) sensitivity determining-region, mutant NS5AD2Δ was as sensitive as the wild type to IFN-α and IFN-λ in vitro, but severely attenuated in vivo. This attenuation could be recapitulated in PHHs and was linked to higher activation of the IFN response, concomitant with reduced viral replication and virus production. Importantly, immune-reconstituted Huh7-derived cell lines revealed a sequential activation of the IFN-response via RIG-I (retinoic acid-inducible gene I) and MDA5 (Myeloma differentiation associated factor 5), respectively, that was significantly higher in the case of the mutant lacking most of NS5A D2. Conclusions Our study reveals an important role of NS5A D2 for suppression of the IFN response that is activated by HCV via RIG-I and MDA5 in a sequential manner. ? 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.",HCV; HCV-mediated MDA5 activation; NS5A; Subversion of interferon response,"alpha interferon; interferon; interferon lambda; myeloma differentiation associated factor 5; nonstructural protein 5A; protein; retinoic acid inducible protein I; unclassified drug; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; NS-5 protein, hepatitis C virus; virus DNA; virus protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; cytokine response; female; gene deletion; Hepatitis C virus; hepatocellular carcinoma cell line; human; human cell; immunocompetence; in vitro study; in vivo study; innate immunity; liver cell; male; mouse; mutant; nonhuman; priority journal; transgenic mouse; viral genetics; virus activation; virus attenuation; virus mutant; virus replication; wild type; xenograft; animal; disease model; dna mutational analysis; drug effects; genetics; genotype; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; metabolism; mutation; pathology; virology; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Disease Models, Animal; DNA Mutational Analysis; DNA, Viral; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Hepatocytes; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Male; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation; Viral Nonstructural Proteins",2-s2.0-84940730465

Materials and methods: Forty-six children with congenital heart disease (median age: 109?days) were examined using dual-source CT. Scans were performed at 80?kV and 70?kV in 21 and 25 children, respectively. A nonionic iodinated contrast medium (300?mg I/ml) was used for the 80-kV protocol. The contrast medium was diluted to 75% (225 mgI/mL) with saline for the 70-kV protocol. Image noise was measured in the two protocols for each group by extracting the standard deviations of a region of interest placed on the descending aorta. We then determined whether sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction reduced the image noise at 70?kV. Results: There was more noise at 70?kV than at 80?kV (29 ± 12 vs 20 ± 4.8; P < 0.01). Sinogram-affirmed iterative reconstruction with grade 4 strength settings improved the noise (20 ± 5.9; P < 0.01) for the 70-kV group.

Dysregulation of one or more of these events leads to persistent HBV infection and a variably severe chronic necroinflammatory liver disease that fosters the development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

Therefore, we performed an updated metaanalysis of all currently publications to clarify this relationship. From PubMed and Chinese language (WanFang) databases, we located articles published up to June 1, 2015, obtaining 21 case-control studies from 20 different articles containing 8913 cases and 9944 controls based on search criteria for cancer susceptibility related to the miR-149 rs2292832 T/C SNP. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) revealed association strengths. There had no association between this SNP and whole cancer risk. At the same time, in several subgroups, also no association was found in ethnicity, sex and smoking status. Nevertheless, poorly significant association was detected in cancer type (Digestive cancer: OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.81-1.00, Pheterogeneity = 0.142 for CT vs. TT) and source of control (population-based: OR = 1.15, 95% CI = 1.00-1.32, Pheterogeneity = 0.427 for CC vs. CT+TT) subgroups. The miR-149 rs2292832 T/C SNP may poorly decrease digestive cancer risk.

So, this study aimed to characterize variants of S gene product of hepatitis B virus (HBV) isolated from patients with overt or occult HBV infection in north-eastern Egypt. Methods: The study included sera of two different groups of volunteer blood donors (VBDs), 82 with overt HBV that were positive for HBsAg and anti-HBc and 343 donors negative for HBsAg eligible for donation. Of the latter group, only 44 were positive for anti-HBc. All anti-HBc positive sera were subjected to HBV DNA detection and partial sequence analysis targeting the HBV S gene. Results: HBV DNA was detected in 22.7 % of HBsAg-/anti-HBc?+?(10/44 patients) and in 90 % of HBsAg?+?donors (74/82 patients) with significant statistical difference (P?=?0.0001). Phylogenetic analysis showed that HBV strains retrieved from both groups were of genotype D. Amino acid escape mutation T125M was detected in only 2 samples of the occult infection group and in none of the overt group (P?=?0.01). Different amino acid substitutions were identified in overt infection group: S143L/T (16.2 %, 12/74) and P120T/S (2.7 %, 2/74). Q129R was significantly more frequent in cases with occult HBV infection (40 %, 4/10) than overt group (6.8 %, 5/74) (P?=?0.01).

Recent genome-wide association studies have highlighted several genetic alterations as predictive risk factors of rapid fibrosis progression in chronic hepatitis C. However, most of these results require verification, and whether the combined use of these genetic predictors can assess the risk of fibrosis progression remains unclear. Therefore, genetic risk factors associated with fibrosis progression were analyzed in 176 chronic hepatitis C patients who did not achieve sustained virological response by inter-feron-based therapy and linked to the fibrosis progression rate (FPR). FPR was determined in all patients by paired liver biopsy performed before and after therapy (mean interval: 6.2 years). Mean FPR in patients with IL28B (rs8099917) TG/GG and PNPLA3 (rs738409) CG/GG were significantly higher than in those with IL28B TT (FPR: 0.144 vs. 0.034, P < 0.001) and PNPLA3 CC (FPR: 0.10 vs. 0.018, P = 0.005), respectively. IL28B TG/GG [hazard ratio (HR):3.9, P = 0.001] and PNPLA3 CG/GG (HR: 3.1, P = 0.04) remained independent predictors of rapid fibrosis progression upon multivariate analysis together with average alanine aminotransferase after interferon therapy >40 IU/l (HR: 4.2, P = 0.002). Based on these data, we developed a new clinical score predicting the risk of fibrosis progression (FPR-score). The FPR-score identified subgroups of patients with a low (FPR: 0.005), intermediate (FPR: 0.103, P < 0.001), and high (FPR: 0.197, P < 0.001) risk of fibrosis progression. In conclusion, IL28B and PNPLA3 genotypes are associated with rapid fibrosis progression, and the FPR-score identifies patients who has a high risk of fibrosis progression and require urgent antiviral treatment.

In this study, we established a human myeloma cell line, 8226/AMY1, in which a lentivirally transfected AMY1 gene was stably expressed and explored its biological characteristics. 8226/AMY1 showed a survival advantage over mock control when treated with dexamethasone, bortezomib, and lenalidomide in vitro partly through inhibition of apoptosis induced by these reagents. In a xenograft murine model, 8226/AMY1 showed rapid tumor growth and reduced sensitivity to bortezomib compared with mock. A microarray gene expression analysis identified TCL1A, which functions as a coactivator of the cell survival kinase Akt, differentially up-regulated in 8226/AMY1. The expression of phosphorylated Akt was increased in the 8226/AMY1 cells following bortezomib treatment, but not in the mock cells. In addition, treatment with perifosine, an inhibitor of Akt phosphorylation, enhanced the anti-myeloma effect of bortezomib in the 8226/AMY1 cells.

To evaluate, through a systematic review of the literature, the association between the use of biological disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) and surgical site infection (SSI) or wound healing delay after orthopedic surgery in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods. A systematic review of articles indexed in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, and Web of Science from 1992 to 2012 was performed. The search aimed to identify studies describing SSI or wound healing delay in patients with RA treated with or without bDMARDs. Articles fulfilling the predefined inclusion criteria were reviewed systematically and their quality was appraised. Results. There was no Cochrane review on this subject. We found 75 articles through specific searches of PubMed and Web of Science, and hand searching. After inclusion and exclusion by full-text review, 10 articles were found for SSI, and 5 articles for delayed wound healing. The use of bDMARDs appeared to increase the rate of SSI slightly, especially in large joint-replacement surgery. Delayed wound healing was not increased by the use of bDMARDs. However, the definitions of SSI and delayed wound healing varied between the reviewed articles. Most of the articles focused on tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitors. Conclusion. bDMARDs slightly increase the relative risk of SSI but not that of delayed wound healing after orthopedic surgery and should be used with appropriate caution. ? 2015 Japan College of Rheumatology.",Biological agent; Delayed wound healing; Perioperative complication; Rheumatoid arthritis; Surgical site infection; Systematic review,"biological disease modifying antirheumatic drug; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; tumor necrosis factor alpha; tumor necrosis factor alpha inhibitor; unclassified drug; antirheumatic agent; Article; data processing; human; joint prosthesis; meta analysis; postoperative complication; priority journal; rheumatoid arthritis; risk factor; surgical infection; systematic review; wound healing impairment; adverse effects; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; drug effects; orthopedic surgery; Surgical Wound Infection; wound healing; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Humans; Orthopedic Procedures; Surgical Wound Infection; Wound Healing",2-s2.0-84940551181

We previously showed poor medication adherence in Japanese dermatological patients. Objective: This study was conducted to determine the level of adherence to oral or topical medication in Japanese patients with atopic dermatitis, attempting to characterize the socioeconomic status of those patients with poor adherence. Methods: A web questionnaire survey on demographic data as well as adherence level was conducted on patients registered in the monitoring system. Adherence level was assessed with Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8). Among a total of 3096 respondents with dermatological disorders, data of 1327 subjects with atopic dermatitis were extracted and analyzed. Results: More than 80% of subjects felt that both oral and topical medications were safe and efficacious, while less than 60% of them were satisfied with their treatment. Levels of adherence to oral and topical treatments were evaluated with MMAS-8, giving scores of 4.6 and 4.2, respectively. Demographic factors such as gender, marital status, state of employment, alcohol consumption, frequency of hospital visits, and experience of drug effectiveness had a significant impact on the degree of adherence to treatment. Conclusion: Medication adherence level in Japanese subjects with atopic dermatitis was relatively low compared with that of other chronic diseases.

Few studies have examined whether nonlinear dynamics of the heart rate could predict ischemic strokes in AF. We examined whether a novel complexity measurement of the heart rate variability called multiscale entropy (MSE) was a useful risk stratification measure of ischemic strokes in patients with permanent AF. Methods and Results: We examined 173 consecutive patients (age 69±11 years) with permanent AF who underwent 24-hour Holter electrocardiography from April 2005 to December 2006. We assessed several frequency ranges of the MSE and CHA2DS2-VASc score (1 point for congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, vascular disease, an age 65 to 74 years, and a female sex and 2 points for an age?75 years and a stroke or transient ischemic attack). We found 22 (13%) incident ischemic strokes during a mean follow up of 3.8-years. The average value of the MSE in the very-low frequency subrange (90-300 s, MeanEnVLF2) was significantly higher in patients who developed ischemic strokes than in those who did not (0.68 ±0.15 vs. 0.60±0.14, P&lt;0.01). There was no significant difference in the C-statistic between the CHA2DS2-VASc score and MeanEnVLF2 (0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.43-0.69 vs. 0.66; 95% confidence interval, 0.53-0.79). After an adjustment for the age, CHA2DS2-VASc score, and antithrombotic agent, a Cox hazard regression model revealed that the MeanEnVLF2 was an independent predictor of an ischemic stroke (hazard ratio per 1-SD increment, 1.80; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-2.07, P&lt;0.01). Conclusion: The MeanEnVLF2 in 24-hour Holter electrocardiography is a useful risk stratification measure of ischemic strokes during the long-term follow-up in patients with permanent AF.

Here, using multiple murine tumor models and human MDSC, we show that MDSC populations that expand in cancer have only partially primed regulatory function and limited prometastatic activity unless they are fully educated by tBregs. Cancer-induced tBregs directly activate the regulatory function of both the monocyte and granulocyte subpopulations of MDSC, relying, in part, on TgfβR1/TgfβR2 signaling.MDSC fully educated in this manner exhibit an increased production of reactive oxygen species and NO and more efficiently suppress CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, thereby promoting tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, loss of tBregs or TgfβR deficiency in MDSC is sufficient to disable their suppressive function and to block metastasis. Overall, our data indicate that cancer-induced B cells/B regulatory cells are important regulators of theimmunosuppressive and prometastatic functions of MDSC. ? 2015 AACR.",,"nitric oxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; transforming growth factor beta receptor 1; transforming growth factor beta receptor 2; protein serine threonine kinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; TGF-beta type I receptor; transforming growth factor beta receptor; transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor; animal tissue; Article; B lymphocyte; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell expansion; cell function; cell loss; cell population; granulocyte; human; human cell; immune deficiency; metastasis; monocyte; mouse; murine model; myeloid derived suppressive cell; nonhuman; priority journal; signal transduction; suppressor cell; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor growth; tumor model; animal; B lymphocyte; bone marrow cell; cell lineage; disease model; experimental melanoma; immunology; immunosuppressive treatment; metabolism; pathology; Animals; B-Lymphocytes, Regulatory; Cell Lineage; Disease Models, Animal; Granulocytes; Humans; Immunosuppression; Melanoma, Experimental; Mice; Monocytes; Myeloid Cells; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Reactive Oxygen Species; Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-84942920079

In this study, we developed a cyclodextrin (CD)-based novel carrier-drug conjugate, called per-FOL-β-CD-ss-DOX, which has folic acid (FA) molecules at the end of primary hydroxyl groups of β-CD and a pH-cleavable spacer with an anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), at the end of secondary hydroxyl groups. This per-FOL-β-CD-ss-DOX exhibited a significant cellular uptake as compared with the free DOX solution by EMT6/P cells, which activate the expression of folate receptor (FR). Cellular uptake of per-FOL-β-CD-ss-DOX was significantly inhibited in the presence of FA and was also inhibited at 4°C. The conjugate exhibited remarkable cytotoxic effects in EMT6/AR1 cells, which are resistant to DOX, whereas free DOX solution did not exhibit this effect. These results suggest that per-FOL-β-CD-ss-DOX can be taken up into cells via FR-related endocytosis and the cleaved DOX derived from it in endosomes could escape the efflux caused by P-glycoprotein, resulting in the cytotoxic effect. Therefore, the drug delivery by per-FOL-β-CD-ss-DOX may be a useful approach for drug delivery to FR-expressing cells such as drug-resistant malignant cancers. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",cancer; cyclodextrin; drug delivery; drug resistance; folate; per-FOL-β-CD; receptor-mediated endocytosis; supramolecular chemistry,"cyclodextrin; doxorubicin; drug carrier; folate receptor; hydroxyl group; antineoplastic agent; cyclodextrin; doxorubicin; folic acid; animal cell; Article; breast tumor; controlled study; drug conjugation; drug cytotoxicity; drug targeting; fluorescence imaging; human; human cell; in vitro study; molecule; mouse; nonhuman; pH; protein expression; tumor cell; animal; chemistry; drug delivery system; drug effects; drug resistance; procedures; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Cyclodextrins; Doxorubicin; Drug Carriers; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Folic Acid; Mice",2-s2.0-84939256404

This requires lamivudine resistance mutations (LAMr) and at least one additional mutation. Here, we characterized two novel mutations, rtI163V and rtA186T, associated with viral breakthrough (VBT) in an ETV-refractory patient. Methods HBV from an ETV-refractory patient was sequenced, and newly identified mutations were inserted into a replication-competent clone by mutagenesis. Clones were analyzed for replication efficacy and susceptibility to ETV in vitro. Chimeric mice with human hepatocytes were inoculated with the patient's serum at VBT, and monitored for viral mutation pattern using a next-generation sequencing approach. Results RtI163V and rtA186T mutations were detected together with LAMr (rtL180M and rtM204V) at VBT. RtA186T plus LAMr reduced susceptibility to ETV more than 111.1-fold compared with the wild-type clone, while rtI163V plus LAMr resulted in a 20.4-fold reduction. RtA186T significantly reduced viral replication efficacy, while the rtI163V mutation rescued it. Interestingly, the viral mutation pattern in the chimeric mice indicated dominant (or selective) proliferation of a clone containing rtI163V and rtA186T mutations plus LAMr under ETV treatment. Three-dimensional docking simulation indicated that rtA186T reduced the binding affinity of the HBV polymerase to ETV. Conclusions VBT in this ETV-refractory patient is attributable to the novel ETV resistance mutations rtI163V and rtA186T. RtA186T was apparently responsible for ETV resistance but the selection of a clone with the double mutation plus LAMr suggests that rtI163V is required to sustain viral fitness. ? 2015 European Association for the Study of the Liver.",Antiviral resistance; Combination therapy; Entecavir; Entecavir resistance; HBV mutations; Hepatitis B treatment; Hepatitis B virus; Lamivudine; rtA186T; rtI163V; Viral breakthrough,"adefovir; entecavir; lamivudine; antivirus agent; entecavir; guanine; RNA directed DNA polymerase; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiviral resistance; antiviral susceptibility; antiviral therapy; Article; binding affinity; case report; chronic hepatitis B; controlled study; DNA replication; drug efficacy; Hepatitis B virus; human; molecular model; monotherapy; mouse; mutagenesis; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; priority journal; simulation; virus mutation; virus replication; analogs and derivatives; animal; antiviral resistance; chemical structure; genetics; Hepatitis B, Chronic; mutation; Adult; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Drug Resistance, Viral; Guanine; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Mice; Models, Molecular; Mutation; RNA-Directed DNA Polymerase",2-s2.0-84939255104

The amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP), a substrate of Aβ, and β-secretase and β-secretase complex proteins, which process AβPP to generate Aβ, are all membrane proteins. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that alterations in brain lipid metabolism modulate AβPP and/or Aβ metabolism. However, the role of cellular polyunsaturated fatty acids in AβPP processing has not been completely understood yet.We report here that 4 months of treatment of Tg2576 mice with an arachidonic acid (ARA)-or a docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-containing (ARA+ or DHA+) diet prevented memory impairment at 13 months of age. Although, AβPP processing to generate soluble AβPP and induce Aβ synthesis was enhanced, Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio decreased in 14-monthold Tg2576 mice fed with the ARA+ or DHA+ diet. The ARA+ or DHA+ diet did not alter the AβPP levels and the expression levels of Aβ-degrading enzymes. In cortical primary neuron cultures, ARA or DHA treatment also increased soluble AβPP and Aβ1-40 levels, and decreased Aβ 1-42/Aβ 1-40 ratio, which are similar to what were observed in Tg2576 mice fed with ARA+ or DHA+ diet.

In patients with peak velocity ?2 m/s, changes in iAVA were not related to any baseline characteristics, but peak velocity was less increased under treatment with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI). Conclusions: In Japanese, the use of warfarin may exacerbate DAVD, and augmented management of atherosclerotic risk factors beyond the recommendations in the current guidelines is unlikely to exert additional benefit. The prescription of ARB for DAVD patients before the development of AS or ACEI after the development of AS may be useful. ? 2015, Japanese Circulation Society.

We investigated the relationship between household exposure to pesticides and childhood AL. Between 2009 and 2010 in Shanghai, a total of 248 newly diagnosed cases of AL and 111 gender-, age-, and hospital-matched controls were included. Five nonspecific dialkyl phosphate (DAP) metabolites of organophosphate pesticides (OPPs) [including dimethyl phosphate (DMP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), dimethyl thiophosphate (DMTP), diethyl thiophosphate (DETP), and diethyl dithiophosphate (DEDTP)] in the urine were analyzed by gas chromatography. The results showed that the median DMP, DEP, DMTP, DETP, and DEDEP levels adjusted for creatinine (Cr) in cases (13.2, 10.0, 31.3, 8.5, and 6.1?μg?g?1, respectively) were all significantly elevated compared with those in controls (3.6, 3.6, 13.3, 2.7, and 1.7?μg?g?1, respectively) (P &lt; 0.05). The household use of mosquito repellent was significantly associated with an increased risk of childhood AL (odds ratio (OR) = 1.9; 95?% confidence interval (CI) 1.2–3.1). Moreover, higher exposures were significantly associated with an elevated risk of childhood AL for DMs, DEs, and DAPs. Our findings support the notion that the household use of pesticides may play a role in the etiology of childhood AL and provide some evidence to warrant further investigation of the link between household pesticide exposures and childhood AL in Shanghai. ? 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Acute leukemia; Case-control; Child; China; Household; Pesticides,"blood system disorder; child health; etiology; gas chromatography; health risk; pesticide residue; pollution exposure; public health; repellent; spatiotemporal analysis; tumor; China; Shanghai; pesticide; adolescent; analysis; case control study; child; China; environmental exposure; female; human; infant; leukemia; male; newborn; preschool child; risk; Adolescent; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Leukemia; Male; Pesticides; Risk",2-s2.0-84937978216

Methods: The Institutional Review Board approved this study and patients provided written informed consent. Thirty-five patients (24 men and 11 women, mean 74?±?6?years [range 60–87?years]) with BCLC stage-B (57?%, 20/35) or stage-C (43?%, 15/35) HCCs who were not candidates for other locoregional treatments were enrolled. HAIC was performed using a suspension of fine-powder cisplatin with a maximum dose of 65?mg/m2 and iodized oil on demand. The primary endpoint was the response rate evaluated based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor (RECIST) and modified RECIST (mRECIST). Secondary endpoints were overall survival, progression-free survival, and safety. Results: The initial and best overall response rates at 4?weeks and 3?months, respectively, were 14 and 17?% based on RECIST, and 57 and 23?% based on mRECIST. The median overall and progression-free survival times were 18 and 4?months, respectively. The most frequent grade-3 or grade-4 adverse events were elevation of serum alanine (23?%) and aspartate aminotransferase (20?%), and thrombocytopenia (17?%). Conclusion: This HAIC provides promising therapeutic effects with acceptable safety to patients with intermediate-stage and advanced-stage HCCs. ? 2014, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Fine-powder cisplatin; Hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy; Hepatocellular carcinomas; Iodized oil,"alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; cisplatin; creatinine; iodinated poppyseed oil; cisplatin; iodinated poppyseed oil; powder; adult; advanced cancer; aged; anemia; anorexia; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer staging; clinical article; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; fatigue; female; fever; hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy; human; hyperkalemia; hypoalbuminemia; hypokalemia; hyponatremia; leukopenia; liver cell carcinoma; male; multicenter study; nausea; neutropenia; overall survival; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; progression free survival; side effect; suspension; therapy effect; thrombocytopenia; treatment response; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; clinical trial; hepatic artery; intraarterial drug administration; Liver Neoplasms; middle aged; pathology; powder; prospective study; treatment outcome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cisplatin; Female; Hepatic Artery; Humans; Infusions, Intra-Arterial; Iodized Oil; Liver Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Powders; Prospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84938751489

Proposed mediators of inflammation in UC include pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-2, and the cell surface adhesive molecule integrin α4β7. Conventional therapeutics for active UC include 5-aminosalicylic acid, corticosteroids and purine analogues (azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine). Patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy are treated with agents such as the calicineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus, the TNF-α inhibitors infliximab or adalimumab, or a neutralizing antibody (vedolizumab) directed against integrin α4β7. These therapeutic agents are of benefit for patients with refractory UC, but are not universally effective. Our recent research on TNF-α shedding demonstrated that inhibition of annexin (ANX) A2 may be a new therapeutic strategy for the prevention of TNF-α shedding during inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) inflammation. In this review, we provide an overview of therapeutic treatments that are effective and currently available for UC patients, as well as some that are likely to be available in the near future. We also propose the potential of ANX A2 as a new molecular target for IBD treatment. ? The Author(s) 2015. Published by Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

IDO expression is increased in tumor tissue and in draining lymph nodes; this increase is thought to play a role in tumor evasion by suppressing the immune response. A competitive inhibitor of IDO is currently being tested in clinical trials for the treatment of relapsed or refractory solid tumors, but the efficacy of IDO inhibition in colorectal tumors remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated the effect of IDO deficiency on colon tumorigenesis in mice by genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition. Ido1-deficient(-/-) mice were crossed with ApcMin/+ mice or were administered azoxymethane with or without dextran sodium sulfate. Ido1 deficiency did not lead to significant differences in the size and number of colon tumors. Similarly, the pharmacological inhibition of IDO using 1-methyltryptophan (1-mT) also resulted in no significant differences in tumor size and number in ApcMin/+ mice. However, Ido1 deficiency altered the immune response in the tumor microenvironment, showing a significant increase in mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a significant decrease in the number of Foxp3-positive regulatory T cells in the colon tumors of Ido1(-/-) mice. Importantly, 1-mT treatment also significantly altered cytokine expression in the colon tumor tissues. These results suggest that IDO inhibition alone cannot sufficiently suppress colon cancer development in mice despite its immunomodulatory activity in the tumor microenvironment. ? 2015 The Authors.","Cancer immunity; Colorectal cancer; Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase; Microenvironment; Tumorigenesis","1 methyltryptophan; cytokine; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; kynurenine; messenger RNA; transcription factor FOXP3; tryptophan; tryptophan derivative; unclassified drug; enzyme inhibitor; IDO1 protein, mouse; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer recurrence; colon adenocarcinoma; colon adenoma; colon cancer; colon carcinogenesis; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; immune evasion; immune response; immunomodulation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory T lymphocyte; solid tumor; tumor differentiation; tumor microenvironment; tumor volume; animal; C57BL mouse; colon tumor; enzymology; immunohistochemistry; immunology; knockout mouse; metabolism; pathology; real time polymerase chain reaction; tumor microenvironment; Animals; Colonic Neoplasms; Enzyme Inhibitors; Immunohistochemistry; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-84939266366

Methods Open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter, phase 3 study to validate the 18F-labeled β-amyloid tracer florbetaben by comparing in vivo PET imaging with post-mortem histopathology. Results Brain images and tissue from 74 deceased subjects (of 216 trial participants) were analyzed. Forty-six of 47 neuritic β-amyloid-positive cases were read as PET positive, and 24 of 27 neuritic β-amyloid plaque-negative cases were read as PET negative (sensitivity 97.9% [95% confidence interval or CI 93.8-100%], specificity 88.9% [95% CI 77.0-100%]). In a subgroup, a regional tissue-scan matched analysis was performed. In areas known to strongly accumulate β-amyloid plaques, sensitivity and specificity were 82% to 90%, and 86% to 95%, respectively. Conclusions Florbetaben PET shows high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of histopathology-confirmed neuritic β-amyloid plaques and may thus be a valuable adjunct to clinical diagnosis, particularly for the exclusion of AD.

However, few studies are cohort by design, conducted within the Asian context and even fewer studies consider other lymphoid malignancies. The aim of this study was to assess the association between HBV and HCV and the risk of lymphoid malignancies among Japanese adults. Materials and methods: The Japan Public Health Center prospective-based Study Cohort II was initiated in 1993/1994. 20,360 subjects with available data on HBV and HCV infection status from blood samples were followed up until the end of 2010 for an average of 16 years. During 324,139 person-years, 120 newly diagnosed cases of lymphoid malignancies were identified. Cox proportional hazards models were employed to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%CIs). Results: Of 20,360 subjects, 508 were HBsAg positive, 11,035 were anti-HBc positive, and 1,129 subjects were anti-HCV positive at baseline. The presence of HBsAg was positively associated with malignant lymphoma, especially with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (HR. =. 3.56, 95%CI. =. 1.37-9.18) and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (HR=7.22, 95%CI=2.34-22.29). In contrast, no clear association was observed between the presence of anti-HBc and anti-HCV. Conclusion: In conclusion, HBsAg but not anti-HBc or anti-HCV was positively associated with malignant lymphoma, particularly non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in Japanese adults. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Cohort study; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; Japan; Malignant lymphoma; Plasma cell myeloma,hepatitis B core antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; blood sampling; body mass; cancer risk; cohort analysis; disease association; female; follow up; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; human; Japanese (people); large cell lymphoma; major clinical study; male; nonhodgkin lymphoma; obesity; population research; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; smoking; tobacco consumption; complication; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; lymphoma; middle aged; proportional hazards model; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis C; Humans; Lymphoma; Male; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-84938747607

Currently, many clinicians use the Yanagihara, House-Brackmann, and/or Sunnybrook grading systems to assess FNP. Although these assessments are performed by experts, inter- and intra-observer disagreements have been demonstrated. The quantitative and objective analyses of the degree of FNP would be preferred to monitor functional changes and to plan and evaluate therapeutic interventions in patients with FNP. Numerous two-dimensional (2-D) assessments have been proposed, however, the limitations of 2-D assessment have been reported. The purpose of this study was to introduce a three-dimensional (3-D) image generation system for the analysis of facial nerve palsy (FNP) and to show the correlation between the severity of FNP assessed by this method and two conventional systems. Methods: Five independent facial motions, resting, eyebrow raise, gentle eye closure, full smile with lips open and whistling were recorded with our system and the images were then analyzed using our software. The regional and gross facial symmetries were analyzed. The predicted scores were calculated and compared to the Yanagihara and H-B grading scores. We analyzed 15 normal volunteers and 42 patients with FNP. Results: The results showed that 3-D analysis could measure mouth movement in the anteroposterior direction, whereas two-dimensional analysis could not. The system results showed good correlation with the clinical results from the Yanagihara (r2=0.86) and House-Brackmann (r2=0.81) grading scales. Conclusion: This objective method can produce consistent results that align with two conventional systems. Therefore, this method is ideally suited for use in a routine clinical setting. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Facial nerve palsy; House-Brackmann grading scale; Three-dimensional analysis; Yanagihara grading scale,"adolescent; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; computer program; controlled study; diagnostic imaging; disease severity; eyebrow; eyelid closure; face muscle; facial expression; facial nerve paralysis; female; human; image analysis; imaging system; male; muscle tone; prognosis; quantitative analysis; three dimensional imaging; two dimensional imaging; Bell palsy; case control study; facial nerve paralysis; herpes zoster oticus; middle aged; pathophysiology; procedures; software; three dimensional imaging; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bell Palsy; Case-Control Studies; Facial Paralysis; Female; Herpes Zoster Oticus; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Software; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84928928870

We investigated whether percentages of high-attenuation areas (HAA%) and cystic areas (CA%) quantified from CT images were useful as indices of fibrotic IP. Methods: CT images of 74 patients with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IPF, 36; non-specific interstitial pneumonia, 9; unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, 29) were analyzed via in-house computer software, which automatically calculated HAA%, CA%, mean lung density (MLD), standard deviation of lung density (SD-LD), kurtosis, and skewness from CT attenuation histograms. These indices were compared in each instance with physiologic measures, visual fibrosis score, clinical diagnosis, radiologic CT pattern, and prognosis. Results: HAA% correlated significantly with physiologic measures and visual fibrosis score to a moderate extent (%forced vital capacity, rs = -0.59; % carbon monoxide diffusion capacity, rs = -0.43; fibrosis score, rs = 0.23). Densitometric parameters (MLD, SD-LD, kurtosis, and skewness) correlated significantly with physiologic measures and fibrosis score (|rs| = 0.28-0.59). CA% showed no association with pulmonary functions but differed significantly between IPF and other interstitial pneumonias (IPs) (1.50 ± 2.41 % vs. 0.41 ± 0.80 %; P &lt; 0.01) and between the definite usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) pattern and other patterns (1.48 ± 2.38 % vs. 0.55 ± 1.19 %; P &lt; 0.01). On univariate analysis, HAA%, MLD, SD-LD, kurtosis, skewness, fibrosis score, and definite UIP pattern all correlated with survival, with kurtosis alone identified as a significant predictor of mortality on multivariate analysis (hazard ratio = 0.67; 95 % CI, 0.44-0.96; P = 0.03). Conclusion: CA% and HAA% are novel quantitative CT indices with differing properties in fibrotic IP evaluations. HAA% largely reflects physiologic impairments, whereas CA% corresponds with diagnosis and HRCT pattern. Of the CT indices examined, kurtosis constituted the strongest predictor of mortality. ? 2015 Tanizawa et al.",Densitometry; Idiopathic interstitial pneumonias; Prognosis; Quantitative computed tomography,"adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; densitometry; female; fibrosing alveolitis; forced vital capacity; high resolution computer tomography; human; human tissue; image analysis; interstitial pneumonia; kurtosis; limit of quantitation; lung biopsy; lung diffusion capacity; lung function test; major clinical study; male; mean lung density; mortality; population research; retrospective study; skewness; standard deviation of lung density; unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia; diagnostic imaging; fibrosing alveolitis; interstitial pneumonia; lung; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; pathology; prognosis; proportional hazards model; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonias; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Respiratory Function Tests; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84937458429

Since the clinical features of type 2 AIP have not been fully elucidated and this condition is frequently accompanied by inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), we performed a nationwide survey of patients with AIP complicated with IBD to precisely characterize this disease entity. Methods: We collected 138 cases of pancreatitis with complicating IBD from affiliated institutes specializing in AIP or IBD, and comparative study between the IDCP groups and type 1 AIP was performed. Results: Histological examination revealed 15 AIP cases to be IDCP of institutional diagnosis, among which 11 cases were upgraded to IDCP of central diagnosis by an expert pathologist. The IDCP group exhibited younger onset age, no gender bias, frequent abdominal pain, and normal IgG4 value, similar to those of type 2 AIP reported previously. We also witnessed a lower prevalence of jaundice in type 2 AIP than in type 1 AIP that corresponded to imaging findings of less frequent pancreatic head swelling and scarce bile duct stenosis. Conclusions: A characteristic feature of type 2 AIP compared with type 1 AIP is a low frequency of obstructive jaundice that is related to rare lower bile duct stricture due to lower prevalence of pancreatic head swelling. Contrary to type 1 AIP, lower bile duct stricture in this condition has no apparent relation to sclerosing cholangitis. ? 2014, Springer Japan.",Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP); Crohn’s disease; Granulocytic epithelial lesion (GEL); Idiopathic duct-centric chronic pancreatitis (IDCP); Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD); Lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis (LPSP); Ulcerative colitis (UC),"alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; amylase; antinuclear antibody; aspartate aminotransferase; azathioprine; bilirubin; creatinine; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G4; immunoglobulin M; mesalazine; nitrogen; prednisolone; rheumatoid factor; urea; abdominal pain; acute pancreatitis; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; amylase blood level; antibody blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; autoimmune pancreatitis; bilirubin blood level; chronic pancreatitis; clinical feature; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; creatinine blood level; echography; female; health survey; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunoglobulin blood level; immunoglobulin G4 related disease; immunosuppressive treatment; inflammatory bowel disease; intra ductal ultrasonography; major clinical study; male; Mikulicz disease; onset age; priority journal; retroperitoneal fibrosis; sclerosing cholangitis; thyroiditis; type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis; type 2 autoimmune pancreatitis; urea nitrogen blood level; adolescent; aged; Autoimmune Diseases; biopsy; complication; differential diagnosis; disease course; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; middle aged; Pancreatitis, Chronic; retrospective study; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Autoimmune Diseases; Biopsy; Diagnosis, Differential; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84937639229

Less than half of patients suffering from depression can achieve remission after adequate antidepressant treatment. Another promising treatment option is cognitive-behavior therapy (CBT). However, the need for experienced therapists and substantive dedicated time prevent CBT from being widely disseminated. In the present study, we aim to examine the effectiveness of switching antidepressants and starting a smartphone-based CBT program at the same time, in comparison to switching antidepressants only, among patients still suffering from depression after adequate antidepressant treatment. Methods/design: A multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted since September 2014. The smartphone-based CBT program, named the ""Kokoro-App,"" for major depression has been developed and its feasibility has been confirmed in a previous open study. The program consists of an introduction, 6 sessions and an epilogue, and is expected to be completed within 9 weeks by patients. In the present trial, 164 patients with DSM-5 major depressive disorder and still suffering from depressive symptoms after adequate antidepressant treatment for more than 4 weeks will be allocated to the Kokoro-App plus switching antidepressant group or the switching antidepressant alone group. The participants allocated to the latter group will receive full components of the Kokoro-App after 9 weeks. The primary outcome is the change in the total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire through the 9 weeks of the program, as assessed at week 0, 1, 5 and 9 via telephone by blinded raters. The secondary outcomes include the change in the total score of the Beck Depression Inventory-II, change in side effects as assessed by the Frequency, Intensity and Burden of Side Effects Rating, and treatment satisfaction. Discussion: An effective and reachable intervention may not only lead to healthier mental status among depressed patients, but also to reduced social burden from this illness. This paper outlines the background and methods of a trial that evaluates the possible additive value of a smartphone-based CBT program for treatment-resistant depression. ? 2015 Watanabe et al.",Behavior therapy; Cognitive therapy; Computer-assisted therapy; Depression; Randomized controlled trials,"escitalopram; sertraline; antidepressant agent; adult; anaphylaxis; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; clinical effectiveness; cognitive therapy; coma; controlled study; convulsion; diarrhea; disease severity; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug substitution; fatigue; female; headache; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; inappropriate vasopressin secretion; liver failure; major depression; male; mobile application; mobile phone; multicenter study; nausea; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; patient satisfaction; QT prolongation; randomized controlled trial; serotonin syndrome; somnolence; toxic epidermal necrolysis; treatment outcome; xerostomia; clinical protocol; clinical trial; cognitive therapy; comparative study; computer assisted therapy; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant; devices; drug substitution; Japan; methodology; multimodality cancer therapy; procedures; psychological rating scale; psychology; questionnaire; remission; smartphone; time factor; Antidepressive Agents; Clinical Protocols; Cognitive Therapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Depressive Disorder, Treatment-Resistant; Drug Substitution; Humans; Japan; Patient Satisfaction; Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; Remission Induction; Research Design; Smartphone; Surveys and Questionnaires; Therapy, Computer-Assisted; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84937036323

Objective: We sought to compare a retreatment-as-needed versus a fixed-interval regimen. Methods: In this double-blind study, adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were randomized 1:1 to subcutaneous secukinumab at 300 mg (n = 484) or 150 mg (n = 482) weekly from baseline until week 4, and at week 8. At week 12, patients achieving 75% or more improvement from baseline Psoriasis Area and Severity Index score (PASI 75) were rerandomized to 2 dose levels of secukinumab retreatment as needed (n = 217, 300 mg; n = 206, 150 mg) or fixed interval (n = 217; n = 203). Primary end point was noninferiority of retreatment as needed versus fixed interval for maintaining PASI 75 to week 52. Results: Secukinumab induced high responses by week 12 (84.4%-91.1% PASI 75 responders). From week 12 to week 52, more patients on fixed interval (78.2%, 300 mg; 62.1%, 150 mg) maintained PASI 75 versus retreatment as needed (67.7%; 52.4%); statistical noninferiority of retreatment as needed was not established. Overall safety, including very low incidences of treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (<0.5%), was similar between regimens. Limitations: The primary end point was developed without any known precedent. Conclusion: Secukinumab fixed interval showed clear benefit versus the study-specified retreatment-as-needed regimen for maintaining efficacy. Both regimens exhibited safety consistent with previous trials.

Methods A total of 152 cancer patients with MGOO from a university hospital and affiliate hospitals were included. The patients were classified according to chemotherapy status and evaluated for palliative efficacy and safety of SEMS placement. Results Technical success rate, time to oral intake, and parameters indicating improvement of physical condition did not differ between the with- and without-chemotherapy groups after stent placement. Re-intervention and stent migration were significantly more frequent in the with-chemotherapy group than in the without-chemotherapy group after stent placement (re-intervention, 32.4% vs 7.8%, P=0.0005; stent migration, 13.5% vs 1.7%, P=0.0097). The frequency of adverse events did not differ between the with- and without-chemotherapy groups. Although chemotherapy after stent placement was an independent predictive factor for shortening the stent patency period (hazard ratio [HR], 3.10; P=0.0264), the use of additional stents facilitated uneventful recovery and further prolonged survival time (HR, 0.60; P=0.0132). Conclusions Various cancer patients with MGOO can undergo SEMS placement safely regardless of chemotherapy, and concurrent chemotherapy after stent placement can prolong survival time, although re-intervention and stent migration may be increased. ? 2015 The Authors.

We report the final results of our study testing the following regimen: for tumors less than 1.5, 1.5-3, and greater than 3 cm in diameter, 44, 48, and 52 Gy, respectively, were given in four fractions with interfraction intervals of greater than or equal to 3 days. Methods: Among 180 histologically proven patients entered, 120 were medically inoperable and 60 were operable. The median patient age was 77 years (range, 29-89). SBRT was performed with 6-MV photons using four noncoplanar and three coplanar beams. Isocenter doses of 44, 48, and 52 Gy were given to four, 124, and 52 patients, respectively. Results: The 5-year overall survival rate was 52.2% for all 180 patients and 66% for 60 operable patients. The 5-year local control rate was 86% for tumors less than or equal to 3 cm (44/48 Gy) and 73% for tumors greater than 3 cm (52 Gy; p = 0.076). Grade greater than or equal to 2 radiation pneumonitis developed in 13% (10% for the 44/48-Gy group and 21% for the 52-Gy group; p = 0.056). Other grade 2 toxicities were all less than 4%. Conclusions: Our first prospective SBRT study yielded reasonable local control and overall survival rates and acceptable toxicity. Refinement of the protocol including dose escalation may lead to better outcome. ? 2015 by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer.",Dose; Fractionation; Lung cancer; Reoxygenation; Stage I; Stereotactic body radiotherapy,"adult; aged; Article; bone scintiscanning; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer survival; cancer therapy; clinical protocol; computer assisted emission tomography; controlled study; dermatitis; esophagitis; female; follow up; human; long term care; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; outcome assessment; overall survival; pericardial effusion; photon therapy; pleura effusion; pneumonia; priority journal; prospective study; radiation dose; radiation injury; radiation pneumonia; radiobiology; reoxygenation; rib fracture; stereotactic body radiation therapy; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Lung Neoplasms; middle aged; pathology; procedures; radiosurgery; survival analysis; very elderly; Adult; Adult; Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Female; Humans; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Male; Middle Aged; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasm Staging; Radiosurgery; Radiosurgery; Survival Analysis; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-84938281341

The number of centers performing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for patients with translocations has steadily increased worldwide. The live birth rate with PGD was reported to be 27-54%. The live birth rate with natural conception was reported to be 37-63% on the first trial and 65-83% cumulatively. To date, however, there has been no cohort study comparing age and the number of previous miscarriages in matched patients undergoing or not undergoing PGD. Thus, we compared the live birth rate of patients with RPL associated with a translocation undergoing PGD with that of patients who chose natural conception. Methods and Findings: After genetic counseling, 52 patients who desired natural conception and 37 patients who chose PGD were matched for age and number of previous miscarriages and these comprised the subjects of our study. PGD was performed by means of fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis. The live birth rates on the first PGD trial and the first natural pregnancy after ascertainment of the carrier status were 37.8% and 53.8%, respectively (odds ratio 0.52, 95% confidence interval 0.22-1.23). Cumulative live birth rates were 67.6% and 65.4%, respectively, in the groups undergoing and not undergoing PGD. The time required to become pregnancy was similar in both groups. PGD was found to reduce the miscarriage rate significantly. The prevalence of twin pregnancies was significantly higher in the PGD group. The cost of PGD was $7,956 U.S. per patient. Conclusions: While PGD significantly prevented further miscarriages, there was no difference in the live birth rate. Couples should be fully informed of the similarity in the live birth rate, the similarity in time to become pregnancy, the advantages of PGD, such as the reduction in the miscarriage rate, as well as its disadvantages, such as the higher cost, and the advantages of a natural pregnancy, such as the avoidance of IVF failure. The findings presented here should be incorporated into the genetic counseling of patients with RPL and carrying a translocation. ? 2015 Ikuma et al.

Platelet-rich plasma was prepared from blood of type 2 DM patients. The platelet aggregation was analyzed in size of aggregates by an aggregometer using a laser scattering method. The protein phosphorylation was analyzed by Western blotting. Phosphorylated-HSP27 and PDGF-AB released from platelets were measured by ELISA. The phosphorylated-HSP27 levels at Ser-78 and Ser-82 induced by collagen were directly proportional to the platelet aggregation. Total HSP27 levels in platelets were decreased concomitantly with the phosphorylation. The released HSP27 levels were significantly correlated with the phosphorylated levels of HSP27 in the platelets stimulated by 0.3 μg/ml collagen. The low dose collagen-stimulated release of HSP27 was detected but relatively small in healthy donors. The released levels of PDGF-AB were in parallel with the levels of released HSP27. Area under the curve (AUC) of small aggregation (9-25 μm) induced by 0.3 μg/ml collagen was inversely proportional to the levels of released HSP27. AUC of large aggregation (50-70 μm) was directly proportional to the levels of released HSP27. Exogenous recombinant phosphorylated- HSP27 hardly affected the aggregation or the released levels of PDGF-AB induced by collagen. These results strongly suggest that HSP27 is released from human platelets accompanied with its phosphorylation induced by collagen, which is correlated with the acceleration of platelet aggregation in type 2 DM patients. ? 2015 Tokuda et al.

However, no quantitative method for detecting the tumorigenic cellular impurities is currently standardized. NOD/Shi-scid IL2Rγnull (NOG) mice have shown high xeno-engraftment potential compared with other well-known immunodeficient strains, e.g. nude mice. Hypothesizing that tumorigenicity test using NOG mice could be a sensitive and quantitative method to detect a small amount of tumorigenic cells in hCTPs, we examined tumor formation after subcutaneous transplantation of HeLa cells, as a model of tumorigenic cells, in NOG mice and nude mice. Sixteen weeks after inoculation, the 50% tumor-producing dose (TPD50) values of HeLa cells were stable at 1.3×104 and 4.0×105 cells in NOG and nude mice, respectively, indicating a 30-fold higher sensitivity of NOG mice compared to that of nude mice. Transplanting HeLa cells embedded with Matrigel in NOG mice further decreased the TPD50 value to 7.9×10 cells, leading to a 5000-fold higher sensitivity, compared with that of nude mice. Additionally, when HeLa cells were mixed with 106 or 107 human mesenchymal stem cells as well as Matrigel, the TPD50 values in NOG mice were comparable to those of HeLa cells alone with Matrigel. These results suggest that the invivo tumorigenicity test using NOG mice with Matrigel is a highly sensitive and quantitative method to detect a trace amount of tumorigenic cellular impurities in human somatic cells, which can be useful in the quality assessment of hCTPs. ? 2015 The Japanese Society for Regenerative Medicine.",Cellular therapy; NOG mice; Quality control; Regenerative medicine; Tumorigenicity test,Article; cancer cell culture; carcinogen testing; cell growth; cell suspension; cell therapy; colony formation; controlled study; HeLa cell line; histology; human; human cell; immune deficiency; immunohistochemistry; mesenchymal stem cell; quantitative assay; regenerative medicine; stem cell transplantation; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; carcinogenicity; male; mouse; NOD SCID gamma mouse; nonhuman; sensitivity analysis; tumor volume; tumor xenograft; matrigel,2-s2.0-84984800038

Objective To assess quantitatively the impact of this regulatory action on patient management using a medical information database (MID). Setting Eight hospitals in Japan. Method Using a commercial MID, we collected data on adult outpatients treated with metformin, including h-metformin, during a 2-year study period between April 1, 2011 and March 31, 2013. The 2-year study period spanned 1?year before and after the regulatory action. The frequencies of lactate measurement in all metformin users, h-metformin users, and new users (started on metformin during the study period) were compared between the periods before and after the regulatory action, using generalized estimating equations. Trends in metformin prescription for elderly patients were analysed month-wise by regression analysis using an interrupted time series design. Main outcome measure The rate ratios (RR) of lactate testing before and after the regulatory action. Results Of 4347 metformin users, 784 patients were >75?years old. A significant increase in lactate measurement was observed after the regulatory action than before in the overall study population, with an adjusted RR of 2.14 (95?% confidence interval 1.24–3.68). No significant change was found in h-metformin users and new users because lactate measurements were being performed as frequently in these subgroups before the regulatory action. There were no meaningful changes in the proportion of elderly metformin users in the overall population. Conclusion The regulatory action led to increased lactate measurement in the overall metformin users, but did not affect metformin prescription rate in the elderly patients. Our findings probably reflect the doctors’ judgement that the benefits of metformin use outweigh the risk of lactic acidosis if lactate testing is performed regularly. ? 2015, Koninklijke Nederlandse Maatschappij ter bevordering der Pharmacie.",Boxed warning; Drug safety; Japan; Lactic acidosis; Medical information; Metformin; Regulatory action,"antidiabetic agent; lactic acid; metformin; Acidosis, Lactic; adult; aged; blood; chemically induced; clinical practice; cohort analysis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug control; factual database; female; human; information processing; Japan; male; middle aged; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; young adult; Acidosis, Lactic; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Data Collection; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug and Narcotic Control; Female; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Japan; Lactic Acid; Male; Metformin; Middle Aged; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Retrospective Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84937763029

We applied the calcium score for analyzing carotid plaque calcification in focus on its relationship with symptoms and discuss the difference in transitional patterns and the clinical outcome in comparison with calcified coronary plaques. Methods Multidetector row computed tomography angiography was performed preoperatively to determine the Agatston calcium score, volume score, and Hounsfield values for a total of 330 carotid arteries from 194 patients. Analysis focused on the relation of the symptomatic rate to calcium score, volume score, and Hounsfield value as well as the characteristics of calcified plaques and coexisting diseases. The symptomatic rate of carotid artery plaques in each range of the index was calculated as the percentage of the number of carotid arteries with plaques, which elicited symptoms of the contralateral limbs or the ipsilateral retina to the whole number of carotid arteries with plaques within the range. Results Calcified carotids with low symptomatic rate (<40%) tended to have calcification with significantly high calcium scores, high volume scores and mean/maximum Hounsfield values, high circularities, outer positions, positive remodeling, and carotid bulb/common carotid locations by univariate analysis, whereas high maximum Hounsfield value, high circularity, and outer position of calcification were significant independent predictors of low-symptomatic calcified carotid plaques by multivariate logistic regression analysis. When analyzed by calcium score, the rates for symptomatic carotids showed double peaks at calcium scores around 200-400 and 600-800 with a dip at 400-600. Significant independent predictors of low symptomatic carotid artery were high maximum Hounsfield value (odds ratio [OR], 5.70; P =.005), calcification encircling the carotid perimeter (OR, 7.18; P =.005), and the calcium location in the common carotid artery (OR, 6.62; P =.006) in comparing groups with low (0-400) and medium (400-600) calcium scores, whereas a high volume score (OR,.01; P =.003) alone was a significant independent determinant in the comparison between groups with high (600-1000) and medium calcium scores. Conclusions Symptomatic rates of carotid plaque calcification were demonstrated to show double peaks with increasing calcium score and represent different features.

Since the antigenicity of this virus evolves rapidly, several attempts have been made to predict the major amino acid sequence of hemagglutinin 1 (HA1) in the target season of vaccination. However, the usefulness of predicted sequence was unclear because its relationship to the antigenicity was unknown. Here the antigenic model for estimating the degree of antigenic difference (antigenic distance) between amino acid sequences of HA1 was integrated into the process of selecting vaccine strains for H3N2 human influenza A virus. When the effectiveness of a potential vaccine strain for a target season was evaluated retrospectively using the average antigenic distance between the strain and the epidemic viruses sampled in the target season, the most effective vaccine strain was identified mostly in the season one year before the target season (pre-target season). Effectiveness of actual vaccines appeared to be lower than that of the strains randomly chosen in the pre-target season on average. It was recommended to replace the vaccine strain for every target season with the strain having the smallest average antigenic distance to the others in the pre-target season. The procedure of selecting vaccine strains for future epidemic seasons described in the present study was implemented in the influenza virus forecasting system (INFLUCAST) (. http://www.nsc.nagoya-cu.ac.jp/~yossuzuk/influcast.html). ? 2015 The Author.

Patients were assigned 1:1 to receive mLSG15 plus mogamulizumab or mLSG15 alone. The primary endpoint was the complete response rate (%CR); secondary endpoints included the overall response rate (ORR) and safety. The %CR and ORR in the mLSG15-plus-mogamulizumab arm (n = 29) were 52% [95% confidence interval (CI), 33-71%] and 86%, respectively; the corresponding values in the mLSG15 arm (n = 24) were 33% (95% CI, 16-55%) and 75%, respectively. Grade ? 3 treatment-emergent adverse events, including anaemia, thrombocytopenia, lymphopenia, leucopenia and decreased appetite, were observed more frequently (?10% difference) in the mLSG15-plus-mogamulizumab arm. Several adverse events, including skin disorders, cytomegalovirus infection, pyrexia, hyperglycaemia and interstitial lung disease, were observed only in the mLSG15-plus-mogamulizumab arm. Although the combination strategy showed a potentially less favourable safety profile, a higher %CR was achieved, providing the basis for further investigation of this novel treatment for newly diagnosed aggressive ATL.

The purpose of this study was to identify the clinical features of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients comorbid with MDD and to investigate the influence of MDD on the effect of treatment in patients with NAFLD. Methods: A total of 258 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD were included. MDD was diagnosed according to the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, text revision. The patients were followed up for 48 weeks under standard care for NAFLD, which consisted mainly of lifestyle modification. Results: There were 32 patients comorbid with MDD. They were characterized by more severe histological steatosis and higher NAFLD activity score, and also significantly higher levels of serum aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and ferritin, than age-and-sex-matched NAFLD patients without MDD. Moreover, NAFLD patients with MDD showed poor response to the standard care for NAFLD, in body weight loss and in other parameters. Particularly, NAFLD patients with unstable MDD (not in full/partial remission) showed severe resistance to the treatment. Conclusion: This is the first study to demonstrate the clinical features and response to therapy of NAFLD patients comorbid with MDD. The comorbid state of MDD was associated with more severe histological liver steatosis and worse treatment outcomes in patients with NAFLD. Further investigations are required to develop new lifestyle modification programs that enable NAFLD patients with MDD to achieve the treatment goal. ? 2015 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Major depressive disorder; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Steatohepatitis,ferritin; gamma glutamyltransferase; adult; aminotransferase blood level; Article; body mass; body weight; comorbidity; controlled study; female; human; liver biopsy; major clinical study; major depression; male; middle aged; nonalcoholic fatty liver; priority journal; steatosis; treatment outcome; weight reduction; aged; comorbidity; Depressive Disorder; follow up; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; risk reduction; severity of illness index; time; Adult; Aged; Comorbidity; Depressive Disorder; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Risk Reduction Behavior; Severity of Illness Index; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84928320005

Methods: We retrospectively compared transpapillary IDUS findings between 15 patients with PSC and 35 patients with IgG4-SC between 2004 and 2014. Results: IDUS findings of circular-asymmetric wall thickness, irregular inner margin, diverticulum-like outpouching, unclear outer margin, heterogeneous internal echo, and disappearance of three layers were significantly higher in PSC than in IgG4-SC (P<0.001). Irregular inner margin, diverticulum-like outpouching, and disappearance of three layers were specific IDUS findings for PSC compared to IgG4-SC. Diverticulum-like outpouching on IDUS and endoscopic retrograde cholangiogram (ERC) was observed in 10 (67%) and five (33%) of 15 patients with PSC, respectively. However, based on IDUS and ERC, diverticulum-like outpouching was not observed in any patient with IgG4-SC. All five patients with diverticulum-like outpouching on ERC had diverticulum-like outpouching on IDUS, and five (50%) of 10 patients without diverticulum-like outpouching on ERC had diverticulum-like outpouching on IDUS. Conclusions: The IDUS findings differed between PSC and IgG4-SC.

Expression of CRegs was assessed on primary cultures of mesothelial cells (HPMC) harvested from PD fluid of 31 PD patients. Because expression of CD55 but not CD46 and CD59 in mesothelial cells was significantly correlated to value of dialysate-to-plasma creatinine concentration ratio (D/P Cre) (p<. 0.005) as an indicator of peritoneal function, we focused on analysis of CD55 expression of HPMCs in comparison with levels of C activation products in the PDF of the PD patients, and their background factors. When comparing expression of the CRegs between systemic neutrophils and HPMC, no correlation was observed, supporting that change of CRegs' expression in HPMC was independently occurring in the peritoneum. Expression of CD55 protein in HPMC was closely correlated with expression at the mRNA level (p<. 0.0001) and was inversely correlated with levels of sC5b-9 (p<. 0.05), but not C3, C4, IL6 and CA125 in the PDF. Complications of diabetes, usage of icodextrin and residual renal function were not correlated with change of CD55 expression in HPMCs. Our data show that the process of PD therapy modifies expression of CD55 on peritoneal mesothelium and triggers local C activation. These findings support efforts to modify PD therapy to limit effects on activation and regulation of the C system. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",CD55; Complement; D/P creatinine; Membrane complement regulators; Peritoneal dialysis,"CD59 antigen; complement; complement component C3; complement component C4; creatinine; decay accelerating factor; icodextrin; interleukin 6; membrane cofactor protein; membrane complement regulator; unclassified drug; CA 125 antigen; CD46 protein, human; CD56 antigen; CD59 antigen; CD59 protein, human; complement; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; membrane cofactor protein; membrane protein; MUC16 protein, human; NCAM1 protein, human; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical laboratory; dialysate to plasma creatinine concentration ratio; end stage renal disease; female; hematological parameters; hemodialysis patient; human; human cell; kidney function; male; mesothelium cell; neutrophil; peritoneal dialysis; peritoneum; primary culture; priority journal; protein expression; clinical trial; complement activation; epithelium; epithelium cell; gene expression regulation; immunology; multicenter study; pathology; Antigens, CD46; Antigens, CD56; Antigens, CD59; CA-125 Antigen; Complement Activation; Complement System Proteins; Epithelial Cells; Epithelium; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Interleukin-6; Male; Membrane Proteins; Peritoneal Dialysis",2-s2.0-84925587513

Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has provided conformational information of GM1 in solution as well as in membrane-like environments. Recently, sophisticated paramagnetism-assisted NMR approaches combined with molecular dynamics simulations have enabled the quantitative exploration of conformational spaces of a series of gangliosides, including GM1, taking into account their minor conformations. NMR techniques have also been successfully applied to investigations of the dynamic interactions of GM1 clusters with amyloidogenic proteins such as amyloid β and α-synuclein associated with neurodegenerative disorders.

Given the low incidence of this disease, however, this association has not been sufficiently elucidated. We aimed to investigate the significance of this polymorphism in Japanese patients. We determined ABCB11 V444A polymorphism frequencies and HLA genotypes in two independent drug-induced cholestasis cohorts. Expression and taurocholate transport activity of proteins from 444A variants were analyzed using Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells. In cohort 1 (n = 40), the V444A polymorphism C-allele frequency (66%) was lower than that in controls (n = 190, 78%), but this difference was not significant (P = 0.09). In cohort 2 (n = 119), comprising patients with cholestatic (n = 19), hepatocellular (n = 74), and mixed (n = 26) liver injuries, the C-allele frequency was lower among patients with cholestatic liver injury (68%) than among those with hepatocellular (75%) or mixed liver injury (83%), although this difference was not significant. In cohort 1, HLA-A?0201 was observed more frequently in patients (22%) than in controls [11%; P = 0.003; odds ratio, 2.4 (95% confidence interval, 1.4-4.0)]. Taurocholate transport activity of 444A-encoded protein was significantly lower than that of 444V-encoded protein (81% of 444V, P < 0.05) because of the reduced protein stability. In conclusion, ABCB11 444A had slightly reduced transport activity, but it did not contribute to the occurrence of drug-induced cholestasis in Japanese patients.

Methods: Two lung cancer cell lines, PC-6 and PC-14, and their CDDP-resistant derivatives, PC-6/CDDP and PC-14/CDDP, were analyzed. OCT expression levels were assayed using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting. Additionally, the effect of OCT6 overexpression, induced by transfection of the OCT6 gene SLC22A16 using a forced expression vector, on cellular sensitivity to CDDP and on intracellular platinum accumulation was measured using PC-14/CDDP cells. Results: Both gene and protein expression of OCT6 were decreased in both CDDP-resistant cell lines compared with their expression in their respective parental cells. Intracellular accumulation of platinum was decreased in PC-14/CDDP cells compared with the parental cells after CDDP treatment. Furthermore, OCT6 overexpression induced by transfection of the OCT6 gene (SLC22A16) forced expression vector-sensitized PC-14/CDDP cells to CDDP and oxaliplatin (L-OHP) concomitant with increased intracellular concentration of platinum.

Active intestinal Beh?et's disease can be complicated by gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding and perforation. We performed a multicenter, open-label, uncontrolled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adalimumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody against tumor necrosis factor α, in patients with intestinal Beh?et's disease who were refractory to corticosteroid and/or immunomodulator therapies. Methods: The study was conducted at 12 sites in Japan, from November 2010 through October 2012. Twenty patients were given 160 mg adalimumab at the start of the study and 80 mg 2 weeks later, followed by 40 mg every other week for 52 weeks; for some patients, the dose was increased to 80 mg every other week. A composite efficacy index, combining GI symptom and endoscopic assessments, was used to evaluate efficacy. The primary efficacy end point was the percentage of patients with scores of 1 or lower for GI symptom and endoscopic assessments at week 24. Secondary end points included complete remission and resolution of non-GI Beh?et's-related symptoms. Results: Nine patients (45%) had GI symptom and endoscopic assessment scores of 1 or lower at week 24 of treatment, and 12 patients (60%) had these scores by week 52. Four patients (20%) achieved complete remission at weeks 24 and 52. Individual global GI symptom and endoscopic scores improved for most patients at weeks 24 and 52. Two thirds of patients with oral aphthous ulcers, skin symptoms, and genital ulcers, and 88% of patients with erythema nodosum had complete resolution of these conditions at week 52. A total of 9 of 13 patients (69%) taking steroids at baseline were able to taper (n= 1) or completely discontinue steroids (n= 8) during the study. No new safety signals were observed. Conclusions: Adalimumab is a potentially effective treatment for intestinal Beh?et's disease in Japanese patients who are refractory to conventional treatments.

Predictors of response to chemotherapy and prognostic factors for survival might be different in estrogen receptor (ER)-positive breast cancer. Methods: Women with Stage II to III ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer treated with anthracycline and taxane-containing neoadjuvant chemotherapy between 2003 and 2011 were retrospectively analyzed. Expression of forkhead box A1 (FOXA1), B cell lymphoma 2 (BCL2) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) as well as ER, progesterone receptor, HER2 and Ki67 was examined by immunohistochemistry in pre- and post-treatment specimens. Factors predictive of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy and distant disease-free survival were analyzed. Results: Tumor grade was positively correlated with Ki67 expression. Expression levels of ER were positively correlated with expression levels of HER2, BCL2, FOXA1 and MAPT in pre-treatment tumors. The Ki67 labeling index was the only factor that was significantly associated with clinical response measured by the reduction of tumor volume and pCR. Lymph node status, expression of ER before neoadjuvant chemotherapy and expression of FOXA1 after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were significantly associated with distant disease-free survival, both by univariate and multivariate analyses. Conclusions: Patients with ER-positive HER2-negative breast cancer should be selected for neoadjuvant chemotherapy. FOXA1 expression could be a prognostic marker in ER-positive breast cancer. ? 2013, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.",Breast cancer; Estrogen receptor; FOXA1; Neoadjuvant chemotherapy,"antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; estrogen receptor; FOXA1 protein, human; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3alpha; MAPT protein, human; progesterone receptor; protein bcl 2; tau protein; tumor marker; adult; aged; Breast Neoplasms; cancer grading; cancer staging; enzyme immunoassay; female; follow up; human; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; neoadjuvant therapy; pathology; prognosis; retrospective study; survival rate; tumor invasion; tumor recurrence; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-alpha; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Middle Aged; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Grading; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen; Receptors, Progesterone; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; tau Proteins",2-s2.0-84878815596

Liu et al. found that NKILA (1) is upregulated by immunostimulants, (2)has a promoter with an NF-ΚB binding motif, (3)can bind to the p65 protein of the NF-ΚB transcription factor and then interfere with phosphorylation of IΚBα, and (4) negatively affects functions that involve NF-ΚB pathways. And, importantly, they found that (5) low NKILA expression in breast cancers is associated with poor patient prognosis. However, they entirely failed to mention PMEPA1, a gene which runs antisense to NKILA, and the expression of which is associated with several tumors and which encodes a protein that participates in immune pathways. The PMEPA1 locus, including its promoter region, which Liu et al. 1 only discuss in regard to NKILA, is highly conserved through evolution. Our impression is that NKILA emerged only later in evolution, possibly as an additional means of PMEPA1 regulation. Liu et al., however, only consider direct binding between NKILA and NF-ΚB as the mechanism for their in vivo observations of NKILA function, but do not provide solid evidence for their model. If in vivo observations by Liu et al. could be explained by NKILA regulation of PMEPA1, it would contribute to the establishment of PMEPA1 as an important topic of cancer research. We feel that the herein presented discussion is necessary for a correct interpretation of the Liu et al. article. ? 2015 Dijkstra JM and Alexander DB.",,synaptotagmin I; binding affinity; binding site; gene control; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; gene interaction; gene locus; genetic transcription; human; in vivo study; Letter; molecular dynamics; nuclear factor kappa B interacting long noncoding RNA gene; oncogene; PMEPA gene; promoter region; protein interaction; protein RNA binding; signal transduction,2-s2.0-84931292038

Conventional therapeutics for moderate-to-severe CD include 5-aminosalicylic acid, corticosteroids, purine analogs, azathioprine, and 6-mercaptopurine. Patients who fail to respond to conventional therapy are treated with tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α inhibitors such as infliximab and adalimumab, but their efficacy is limited due to primary nonresponse or loss of response. It is suggested that this requires switch to another TNF-α inhibitor, a combination therapy with TNF-α blockade plus azathioprine, or granulocyte and monocyte adsorptive apheresis, and that other therapeutic options having different mechanisms of action, such as blockade of inflammatory cytokines or adhesion molecules, are needed. Natalizumab and vedolizumab are neutralizing antibodies directed against integrin α4 and α4β7, respectively. Ustekinumab is a neutralizing antibody directed against the receptors for interleukin-12 and interleukin-23. Here, we provide an overview of therapeutic treatments that are effective and currently available for CD patients, as well as some that likely will be available in the near future.

ZAG is also considered to be an important modulator of lipid metabolism. However, little is known about the correlation of serum ZAG levels with indicators of metabolic syndrome. Serum ZAG concentrations analyzed by enzyme-linked immunoassay were positively correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure in 326 subjects (236 males and 90 females) aged 17-79 years who had an annual health examination. By luciferase reporter and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, the core promoter region to regulate the ZAG gene expression was found to exist between -110 and -101. The transcription factor Sp1 interacted with this region, and Sp1 knockdown experiments showed that Sp1 critically regulated ZAG expression. Furthermore, ZAG increased the active form of RhoA, which was determined by pull-down assay. Increased serum ZAG concentrations induced, at least partly, by Sp1 may cause an increase in vascular tone through the activation of RhoA and contribute to elevated blood pressure. ? 2015 The Japanese Society of Hypertension All rights reserved.",blood pressure; serum protein; small G protein; transcription factor,"glycoprotein; transcription factor Sp1; unclassified drug; zinc alpha2 glycoprotein; RhoA guanine nucleotide binding protein; RHOA protein, human; seminal plasma protein; transcription factor Sp1; Zn-alpha-2-glycoprotein; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; blood pressure regulation; diastolic blood pressure; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gel mobility shift assay; gene; gene expression; human; human cell; luciferase assay; male; protein blood level; protein interaction; zinc alpha2 glycoprotein gene; animal; biosynthesis; blood; blood pressure; cell line; gene expression regulation; gene silencing; genetics; hypertension; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; middle aged; muscle tone; pathophysiology; physiology; promoter region; rat; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Animals; Blood Pressure; Cell Line; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Metabolic Syndrome X; Middle Aged; Muscle Tonus; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Rats; rhoA GTP-Binding Protein; Seminal Plasma Proteins; Sp1 Transcription Factor; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84926655317

Previously we have demonstrated that lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) increases the oligomer formation of Aβ1-42, the major Aβ peptide found Alzheimer's disease (AD) lesions. In this study, we have investigated whether LPC affects the neurotoxic effects of Aβ1-42 in a neuronal cell line (A1) culture. Dimethyl thiazolyl diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay revealed that up to 10μM concentration, LPC did not affect A1 cell viability. Aβ1-42 decreased the cell viability, and such effect was dose dependently enhanced by LPC. However, neither LPC nor Aβ1-42, alone or in combination increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release from A1 cells after 24-h treatment. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP-biotin nick-end-labeling (TUNEL) assay showed that LPC increased Aβ1-42-induced apoptotic cell number. To determine the underlying mechanisms, the proteins implicated in apoptosis pathways including Bcl-2- and caspase-family were analyzed by Western blotting. The results demonstrated that Aβ1-42 decreased Bcl-2 in A1 cells at 24h, whereas LPC had no effect at any time point. Both LPC and Aβ1-42 increased Bax level at 24h, and their combined stimulation showed a synergistic effect. Similar synergistic effect of LPC and Aβ1-42 on caspase9 activation was observed. Dot blot immunoassay and Western blotting showed that LPC augmented Aβ1-42 oligomer formation in cell culture medium. Removing LPC-induced early-formed Aβ1-42 oligomer from the culture medium by immunoprecipitation decreased active caspase9 level and neurotoxicity, as revealed by Western blotting and MTT assay. Furthermore, dihydroethidium (DHE) assay showed that Aβ1-42 increased reactive oxygen species level in A1 cells, such effect was further enhanced by LPC. Thus, our results demonstrated that LPC increased the oligomer formation process of Aβ1-42 peptide in culture condition, and consequently increased apoptotic neuronal death. Such process might be important for the pathogenesis of AD, and inhibition of LPC generation could be a therapeutic target for the disease. ? 2015 IBRO.",Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid β; Lysophosphatidylcholine; Neuronal apoptosis; Oligomer,"amyloid beta protein[1-42]; caspase; caspase 9; lactate dehydrogenase; lysophosphatidylcholine; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; reactive oxygen metabolite; tetrazolium; amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); BAX protein, human; BCL2 protein, human; CASP9 protein, human; caspase 9; lactate dehydrogenase; lysophosphatidylcholine; peptide fragment; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; reactive oxygen metabolite; Alzheimer disease; apoptosis; Article; cell structure; controlled study; culture medium; dot hybridization; enzyme release; human; human cell; immunoassay; immunoprecipitation; micelle; nerve degeneration; neurotoxicity; nick end labeling; oligomerization; phospholipid metabolism; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; supernatant; Western blotting; cell survival; immunoblotting; metabolism; nerve cell; physiology; tumor cell line; TUNEL assay; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Apoptosis; bcl-2-Associated X Protein; Blotting, Western; Caspase 9; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Humans; Immunoblotting; Immunoprecipitation; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lysophosphatidylcholines; Neurons; Peptide Fragments; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Reactive Oxygen Species",2-s2.0-84925004232

A new 1.9-Fr. no-taper microcatheter has recently become available and can be inserted into a 2.7-Fr. microcatheter. We assessed the applicability of this new triple co-axial (triaxial) system to TAE for lower GI bleeding. Material and methods: Five patients with lower GI bleeding underwent TAE with the triaxial system. The approach was via the femoral artery with a 4-Fr. sheath in all cases. The 4-Fr. catheter and triaxial system were inserted into the artery in which extravasation had occurred. Coil embolization was performed with 0.010-inch coils. We evaluated technical success rate, clinical success rate and complications. Results: All five cases of bleeding occurred at the ascending colon, and were caused by diverticulosis in four cases, and an injury to the artery during polypectomy in one case. The 1.9-Fr. no-taper microcatheter could be inserted into the site of extravasation, the vasa recta, in all procedures and TAE was performed successfully. The disappearance of extravasation was confirmed in all cases following TAE. No patients exhibited any signs of recurrent bleeding or complication. Conclusion: The triaxial system appears to be effective and useful in superselective TAE for lower GI bleeding. ? 2014 Informa Healthcare.",Catheter interventions; Embolization; Triaxial,"adult; aged; artery injury; Article; artificial embolism; ascending colon; clinical article; coil embolization; diverticulosis; extravasation; female; femoral artery; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; guide wire; human; male; microcatheter; polypectomy; priority journal; treatment outcome; triaxial system; very elderly; artificial embolism; catheterization; colon; devices; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; middle aged; procedures; retrospective study; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Catheterization; Colon; Embolization, Therapeutic; Female; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-84924812462

Malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) is suggested as a marker of the initiation and acceleration of atherosclerosis. This study aimed to investigate the impact of MDA-LDL on clinical outcomes in patients with stable angina undergoing lipid-lowering therapy after DES implantation. Methods: In this study, 332 patients whose MDA-LDL was measured before PCI with DES were followed clinically (median 2.9 years). Lipid-lowering therapy was conducted, with the target LDL ?100mg/dL. We analyzed the composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization, and any revascularization. Results: MACE was observed in 64 patients (19.3%). MDA-LDL was significantly higher in the MACE group (139.1±53.2. U/L vs. 106.5±38.3. U/L, p<0.01). Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated a significant relationship between MACE and hemodialysis (Hazard ratio (HR) 4.60; p<0.01), MDA-LDL (per 10. U/L, HR 1.14; p<0.01), multivessel disease (HR 1.78; p=0.02), and high-density lipoprotein (per 10mg/dL, HR 0.79; p=0.03). In the multivariate model, hemodialysis (HR 4.10; p<0.01) and MDA-LDL (per 10U/L, HR 1.10; p<0.01) remained significant predictors of MACE. The optimal MDA-LDL threshold for predicting MACE was 114.1. U/L, identified by the receiver operating characteristic curve. Conclusions: MDA-LDL was associated with future cardiac events in patients with stable angina that underwent lipid-lowering therapy after DES-PCI. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Clinical outcomes; Drug-eluting stent; Malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein,"high density lipoprotein; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; low density lipoprotein; malonaldehyde; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; low density lipoprotein; malonaldehyde; aged; Article; drug eluting stent; female; heart death; heart disease; heart infarction; heart muscle revascularization; hemodialysis; human; ischemia; major clinical study; male; percutaneous coronary intervention; priority journal; prognosis; risk assessment; stable angina pectoris; stent thrombosis; treatment outcome; Angina, Stable; atherosclerosis; blood; chemistry; heart infarction; middle aged; multivariate analysis; proportional hazards model; receiver operating characteristic; reperfusion injury; retrospective study; risk factor; Aged; Angina, Stable; Atherosclerosis; Drug-Eluting Stents; Female; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Lipoproteins, LDL; Male; Malondialdehyde; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Myocardial Infarction; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Reperfusion Injury; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; ROC Curve; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84922496413

In a recent analysis, we also could not find candidate mutations for 20.9% (9/43) of our pedigrees with congenital neurological disorder using pre-designed capture probes (SureSelect V4 or V5). One possible cause for this lack of candidates is that standard WES cannot sequence all protein-coding sequences (CDS) due to capture probe design and regions of low coverage, which account for approximately 10% of all CDS regions. In this study, we combined a selective circularization-based target enrichment method (HaloPlex) with a hybrid capture method (SureSelect V5; WES), and achieved a more complete coverage of CDS regions (?97% of all CDS). We applied this approach to 7 (SureSelect V5) out of 9 pedigrees with no candidates through standard WES analysis and identified novel pathogenic mutations in one pedigree.

In this study, we performed MD simulation using the 3D data for wild-type and 4CycT1mutants3D data. We found that the dynamic structural change of CycT1 H2' helix is indispensable for its activity for the Tat action. Moreover, we detected flexible structural changes of the Tat-recognition cavity in the WT CycT1 comprising of ten AAs that are in contact with Tat. These structural fluctuations in WT were lost in the CycT1 mutants. We also found the critical importance of the hydrogen bond network involving H1, H1' and H2 helices of CycT1. Since similar AA substitutions of the Tat-CycT1 chimera retained the Tat-supporting activity, these interactions are considered primarily involved in interaction with Tat.

We investigated TP53 codon 72 and MDM2 SNP 309 polymorphisms in 32 patients with PDAC, 16 patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP), and 32 normal controls, using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue. We also examined TP53 and MDM2 protein immunohistochemistry (IHC) to assess the involvement of these differences in malignant transformation and disease progression. TP53 Pro/Pro genotype was significantly more frequent in PDAC patients than in controls (65.6 vs. 15.6%, p < 0.001) and no significant difference was found between CP patients (37.5%) and controls. In MDM2 SNP 309, there were no significant differences among the three groups.

We evaluated the effect of rebamipide on N-methyl- N'-nitro- N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG)-induced carcinogenesis in SD rats. Thirty-nine male rats were divided into four groups based on whether or not they were treated with rebamipide and/or MNNG: Control, Rebamipide, Control-M, and Rebamipide-M groups. From 8 weeks of age, rats in the Control-M and Rebamipide-M groups received MNNG in drinking water for 30 weeks. The Rebamipide and Rebamipide-M groups were administered 5 mg/kg/day of rebamipide. At 50 weeks, cancerous lesions were not observed in either the Control or Rebamipide groups. Nine rats in the Control-M group had developed GC, while four rats in the Rebamipide-M group had developed GC. The incidence of cancer in the Rebamipide-M group was significantly less than in the Control-M group (p<0.05), with a trend toward a lower incidence of invasive carcinoma in the Rebamipide-M group.

We investigated this suspected association by measuring plasma concentrations of isoflavones in a nested case-control study of a population-based prospective cohort in Japan. Methods: From 18,628 target participants ages 40 to 69 years who returned the baseline questionnaire and provided blood samples, we selected those with either hepatitis B or hepatitis C virus infection at baseline (n = 1,544). Among these, 90 (28 women and 62 men) were newly diagnosed with primary liver cancer from 1993 through 2006; they were matched with 175 controls (54 women and 121 men). Plasma concentrations of isoflavones (genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and equol) were measured using triple quadrupole tandem liquid chromatographymass spectrometry. The ORs of liver cancer development based on plasma concentrations were estimated with a conditional logistic regression model. Results: Basically, distributions of plasma isoflavone concentrations did not differ between the cases and controls. No statistically significant associations of genistein, daidzein, glycitein, and equol with primary liver cancer risk were found in either women or men. Conclusions: In middle-aged Japanese women and men with hepatitis virus infection, plasma isoflavones were unassociated with the occurrence of primary liver cancer.

Of the enrolled 106 patients from September, 2012 to April, 2013, a cohort of 70 patients composed of 35 patients with gastric cancer and 35 age- and sex-matched healthy controls was analyzed. The gastric cancer group was composed of stage IA of 62.9% (22/35). The urinary levels of MMP-9/NGAL complex (uMMP-9/NGAL) and ADAM12 (uADAM12) were significantly higher in the gastric cancer group compared with the healthy control group as determined by monospecific ELISAs (uMMP- 9/NGAL: median, 85 pg/mL vs. 0 pg/mL; P = 0.020; uADAM12: median, 3.35 ng/mL vs. 1.44 ng/mL; P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that both uMMP-9/NGAL and uADAM12 were signifi cant, independent diagnostic biomarkers for gastric cancer. Moreover, MMP-9/NGAL activity was significantly elevated as determined by gelatin zymography. The combination of uMMP-9/NGAL with uADAM12 distinguished between control samples and gastric cancer samples with an AUC of 0.825 (P < 0.001) in an ROC analysis. Significantly, immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated a high coexpression of MMP-9 and NGAL ( P < 0.001) and high expression of ADAM12 (P < 0.001) in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues ( N = 35).

In the present study, we examined the growth rates of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs, passage 5 (. P=5)) contaminated with various doses of HeLa cells, and compared with that of hMSCs alone. The growth rates of the contaminated hMSCs were comparable to that of hMSCs alone at P=5, but significantly increased at P=6 (0.1% and 0.01% HeLa) or P=7 (0.001% HeLa) within 30 days. These findings suggest that the cell growth analysis is a simple and sensitive method to detect immortalized cellular impurities in hCTPs derived from human somatic cells. ? 2014 The Authors.",Cellular therapy; Mesenchymal stem cell; Quality; Regenerative medicine; Safety; Tumorigenicity,Article; carcinogenicity; cell growth analysis; cell immortalization; controlled study; growth rate; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; mesenchymal stem cell; priority journal; procedures concerning cells; somatic cell; culture technique; cytology; mesenchymal stroma cell; procedures; Cell Culture Techniques; HeLa Cells; Humans; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells,2-s2.0-84924070950

In this study, we investigated the expression and localization of α1-chimaerin mRNA in postmortem human brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease and control subjects. In situ hybridization studies demonstrated that α1-chimaerin was expressed by neurons in the neo-cortex of the temporal lobe and the hippocampus of both controls and Alzheimer's disease cases, with the signal intensity dramatically decreased in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Real-time PCR analysis confirmed a significant reduction of α1-chimaerin mRNA expression in the temporal cortex of Alzheimer's disease cases. In contrast, α2-chimaerin mRNA levels showed no significant difference between the groups. The present study showed reduced α1-chimaerin expression in the brain of Alzheimer's disease cases, suggesting a role in the upregulation of Rac1 activity during the disease process. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Alzheimer's disease; In situ hybridization; Rac1; Real-time PCR; α1-chimaerin,"alpha1 chimerin; chimerin; guanosine triphosphatase activating protein; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; chimerin; messenger RNA; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; autopsy; brain; clinical article; controlled study; female; hippocampus; human; in situ hybridization; male; middle aged; neocortex; priority journal; protein expression; protein localization; real time polymerase chain reaction; temporal cortex; temporal lobe; upregulation; very elderly; Alzheimer disease; brain; case control study; genetics; metabolism; pyramidal nerve cell; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Chimerin 1; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pyramidal Cells; RNA, Messenger; Temporal Lobe",2-s2.0-84923006652

We have found that SHK also exerts potent cytocidal effects on human multiple myeloma (MM) cells, but its anticancer mechanism in MM cells remains to be elucidated. SHK at 2.5-5 μM induced apoptosis in seven MM cell lines, including the bortezomib-resistant cell line KMS11/BTZ. The IC50 value of SHK against KMS11/BTZ was comparable to that of a parental cell line KMS11 (1.1 and 1.56 μM, respectively). SHK induces accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and activates XBP-1 in MM cells, suggesting that SHK functions as a proteasome inhibitor, eventually inducing ER stress-associated apoptosis. SHK increases levels of HSP70/72, which protects cells from apoptosis, and exerts greater cytocidal effects in combination with the HSP70/72 inhibitor VER-155008. At higher concentrations (10-20 μM), SHK induced cell death, which was completely inhibited by a necroptosis inhibitor, necrostatin-1 (Nec-1), while the cytocidal activity was unaffected by Z-VAD-FMK, strongly suggesting that cell death is induced by SHK at high concentrations through necroptosis. The present data show for the first time that SHK induces cell death in MM cells. SHK efficiently induces apoptosis and combination of heat shock protein inhibitor with low dose SHK enhances apoptosis, while high dose SHK induces necroptosis in MM cells.

Reportedly, ACDase has been upregulated in prostate cancer. However, its regulatory mechanism remains unclear. LNCaP (androgen-sensitive prostate cancer cell line) but not PC3 and DU-145, (androgen-unresponsive cell lines) exhibited the highest ACDase protein. Among three cell lines, ASAH1 mRNA level was not correlated with ACDase protein expression, and the 5′-promoter activity did not show androgen dependency, suggesting the post-transcriptional regulation of ACDase in LNCaP cells. Based on these results, LNCaP was analysed further. Casodex, androgen receptor antagonist, and charcoal-stripped FCS (CS-FCS) decreased ACDase protein and activity, whereas dihydrotestosterone in CS-FCS culture increased ACDase protein and enzyme activity. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, prevented the decrease of ACDase protein when cultured in CS-FCS, suggesting the involvement of ubiquitin/proteasome system. Reportedly, USP2, a deubiquitinase, plays an important role in LNCaP cells. USP2 siRNA decreased ACDase protein, whereas USP2 overexpression increased ACDase protein of LNCaP cells. However, SKP2, an ubiquitin E3 ligase known to be active in prostate cancer, did not affect androgen-dependent ACDase expression in LNCaP cells. Thus, ACDase regulation by androgen in androgen-sensitive LNCaP cells is mainly due to its prolonged protein half-life by androgen-stimulated USP2 expression. ? 2015 The Authors 2015.

However, how host factors regulate the ability of NTCP to supportHBVinfection is largely unknown.Weaimed to identify the host signaling that regulated NTCP expression and thereby permissiveness to HBV. Here, a cell-based chemical screening method identified that Ro41-5253 decreased host susceptibility to HBV infection. Pretreatment with Ro41-5253 inhibited the viral entry process without affecting HBV replication. Intriguingly, Ro41-5253 reduced expression of both NTCP mRNA and protein. We found that retinoic acid receptor (RAR) regulated the promoter activity of the human NTCP (hNTCP) gene and that Ro41-5253 repressed the hNTCP promoter by antagonizing RAR. RAR recruited to the hNTCP promoter region, and nucleotides α112 to α96 of the hNTCP was suggested to be critical for RAR-mediated transcriptional activation. HBV susceptibility was decreased in pharmacologically RAR-inactivated cells. CD2665 showed a stronger anti-HBV potential and disrupted the spread ofHBVinfection that was achieved by continuous reproduction of the whole HBV life cycle. In addition, this mechanism was significant for drug development, as antagonization of RAR blocked infection of multiple HBV genotypes and also a clinically relevant HBV mutant that was resistant to nucleoside analogs. Thus, RAR is crucial for regulating NTCP expression that determines permissiveness to HBV infection. This is the first demonstration showing host regulation of NTCP to support HBV infection. ? 2015 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Inc.

The aim of this study was to investigate associations between common polymorphisms in potential functional promoters of cytokine genes and liver damage markers among enrollees of a large Japanese cohort study. Subjects included 3257 Japanese individuals (1608 men and 1649 women, aged 35-69. years). Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter regions of five cytokine genes, IL1B (T-31C), IL6 (C-634G), IL8 (T-251A), IL10 (T-819C), tumor necrosis factor-A (TNFA) (T-1031C), and TNFA (C-857T), were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction. Information regarding alcohol intake, smoking habits, height, and weight was collected by a self-administered questionnaire. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) were measured during a routine health check-up. Of the six SNPs genotyped, an IL6 polymorphism (rs1800796, C-634G) was most strongly associated with a liver damage marker, AST. Mean serum AST was significantly different among the three genotypes (mean. ±. SD, 22.7. ±. 7.3. IU/L for CC, 22.8. ±. 7.7. IU/L for CG, and 24.3. ±. 8.6. IU/L for GG, p= 0.011 by analysis of variance). The differences remained significant after adjustment for potential confounders by general linear models. The variations in mean serum AST and ALT levels were marked especially among men. Thus, the functional polymorphism IL6 C-634G may affect serum AST and ALT levels, possibly through different IL-6 production. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Alanine aminotransferase; Aspartate aminotransferase; Cross-sectional studies; Cytokine; Interleukin; Polymorphism,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; biological marker; cytokine; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; tumor necrosis factor alpha; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; biological marker; IL6 protein, human; interleukin 6; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; body height; body weight; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; female; genetic association; genotype; human; Japanese (people); liver injury; major clinical study; male; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; promoter region; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking; blood; genetics; Japan; liver disease; middle aged; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; Aged; Alanine Transaminase; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Biological Markers; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Interleukin-6; Japan; Liver Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Promoter Regions, Genetic",2-s2.0-84920944244

However, associations between the responses of ISGs to IFN-based therapy and treatment efficacy or interleukin-28B (IL28B) genotype have not yet been determined. Therefore, we investigated the early responses of ISGs and interferon-lambdas (IFN-λs) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) during PEG-IFN/RBV plus NS3/4 protease inhibitor (PI) therapy. We prospectively enrolled 50 chronic hepatitis C patients with HCV genotype 1, and collected PBMCs at baseline, 8 and 24 h after the initial administration of PEG-IFN/RBV/PI. Levels of mRNAs for selected ISGs and IFN-λs were evaluated by real-time PCR. All 31 patients with a favorable IL28B genotype and 13 of 19 with an unfavorable genotype achieved sustained virological responses (SVR). Levels of mRNA for A20, SOCS1 , and SOCS3, known to suppress antiviral activity by interfering with the IFN signaling pathway, as well as IRF1 were significantly higher at 8 h in patients with an unfavorable IL28B genotype than in those with a favorable one (P = 0.007, 0.026, 0.0004, 0.0006, respectively), especially in the non-SVR group. Particularly, the fold-change of IRF1 at 8 h relative to baseline was significantly higher in non-SVR than in SVR cases with an unfavorable IL28B genotype (P = 0.035). In conclusion, levels of several mRNAs of genes suppressing antiviral activity in PBMCs during PEG-IFN/RBV/PI differed according to IL28B genotypes, paralleling treatment efficacy. ? 2015 Iijima et al.",,"interferon regulatory factor 1; messenger RNA; peginterferon alpha2a plus ribavirin; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; telaprevir; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; IL28A protein, human; IL28B protein, human; IL29 protein, human; interleukin derivative; macrogol derivative; peginterferon alpha2a; recombinant protein; ribavirin; suppressor of cytokine signaling; A20 gene; adult; aged; anemia; anorexia; antiviral activity; Article; blood sampling; clinical article; controlled study; drug dose reduction; drug mechanism; drug response; drug safety; female; gene; gene expression; genotype; hepatitis C; human; human cell; IL28B gene; IRF1 gene; ISG15 gene; kidney failure; male; neutropenia; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; prospective study; rash; real time polymerase chain reaction; SOCS1 gene; SOCS3 gene; thrombocytopenia; blood; combination drug therapy; drug effects; genetics; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; metabolism; middle aged; mononuclear cell; single nucleotide polymorphism; treatment outcome; Hepatitis C virus; Adult; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Gene Expression; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Interleukins; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Male; Middle Aged; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prospective Studies; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Recombinant Proteins; Ribavirin; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling Proteins; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84923353575

The unusual vascular network (moyamoya vessels) at the base of the brain with this disease as collateral channels is developed in this disease. Social independence because of cognitive impairment has recently been recognized as an important unsolved social issue with adult moyamoya disease. The patients with cognitive impairment have difficulty in proving their status because the standard neuroradiological and neuropsychological methods to define cognitive impairment with moyamoya disease are not determined. These patients with cognitive impairment should be supported by social welfare as psychologically handicapped persons. Thus Cognitive Dysfunction Survey of the Japanese Patients with Moyamoya Disease (COSMO-JAPAN study) is planned.

However, acute hepatitis B caused by HBV genotype A infection has been increasing in Japan and little is known about the efficacy of immunization with genotype C-based vaccines against non-C infection. We have isolated human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) from individuals who were immunized with the genotype C-based vaccine. In this study, the efficacies of these two mAbs, HB0116 and HB0478, were analyzed using in vivo and in vitro models of HBV infection. Intravenous inoculation of HBV genotype C into chimeric mice with human hepatocytes resulted in the establishment of HBV infection after five weeks, whereas preincubation of the inocula with HB0116 or HB0478 protected chimeric mice from genotype C infection completely. Interestingly, both HB0116 and HB0478 were found to block completely genotype A infection. Moreover, infection by a genotype C strain with an immune escape substitution of amino acid 145 in the hepatitis B surface protein was also completely inhibited by incubation with HB0478. Finally, in vitro analysis of dose dependency revealed that the amounts of HB0478 required for complete protection against genotype C and genotype A infection were 5.5 mIU and 55 mIU, respectively. These results suggested that genotype Cbased vaccines have ability to induce cross-genotype immunity against HBV infection.

Although the role of several cell adhesion, migration or proliferation molecules in metastasis is established, a novel target for cancer therapy remains to be discovered. Previously, we reported that fad104 (factor for adipocyte differentiation 104), a regulatory factor of adipogenesis, regulates cell adhesion and migration. In this report, we clarify the role of fad104 in the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. The expression level of fad104 in highly metastatic melanoma A375SM cells was lower than that in poorly metastatic melanoma A375C6 cells. Reduction of fad104 expression enhanced the migration and invasion of melanoma cells, while over-expression of FAD104 inhibited migration and invasion. In addition, melanoma cells stably expressing FAD104 showed a reduction in formation of lung colonization compared with control cells. FAD104 interacted with STAT3 and down-regulated the phosphorylation level of STAT3 in melanoma cells. These findings together demonstrate that fad104 suppressed the invasion and metastasis of melanoma cells by inhibiting activation of the STAT3 signaling pathway. These findings will aid a comprehensive description of the mechanism that controls the invasion and metastasis of cancer cells. ? 2015 Katoh et al.",,"FAD104 protein; regulator protein; STAT3 protein; unclassified drug; fibronectin; FNDC3B protein, human; STAT3 protein; adipocyte; Article; cancer inhibition; cell differentiation; cell level; cell migration; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme inhibition; Fad104 gene; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; human; human cell; melanoma cell line; metastasis potential; molecular dynamics; oncogene; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; regulator gene; signal transduction; tumor invasion; antagonists and inhibitors; cell motion; gene expression regulation; genetics; melanoma; metabolism; metastasis; pathology; phosphorylation; tumor cell line; Adipocytes; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Fibronectins; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Melanoma; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Phosphorylation; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor",2-s2.0-84922983652

To identify genetic variants associated with IFN-induced neutropenia, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 416 Japanese CHC patients receiving IFN-based therapy. Based on the results, we selected 192 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to carry out a replication analysis in an independent set of 404 subjects. The SNP rs2305482, located in the intron region of the PSMD3 gene on chromosome 17, showed a strong association when the results of GWAS and the replication stage were combined (OR?=?2.18, P?=?3.05?×?10?7 in the allele frequency model).

Furthermore, DNA methylation, which irreversibly deactivates gene transcription, of the insulin promoter, particularly the cAMP response element, is increased in diabetes patients. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We aimed to investigate insulin promoter DNA methylation in an over-nutrition state. INS-1 cells, the rat pancreatic beta cell line, were cultured under normal-culture-glucose (11.2mmol/l) or experimental-high-glucose (22.4mmol/l) conditions for 14 days, with or without 0.4 mmol/l palmitate. DNA methylation of the rat insulin 1 gene (Ins1) promoter was investigated using bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing analysis. Experimental-high-glucose conditions significantly suppressed insulin mRNA and increased DNA methylation at all five CpG sites within the Ins1 promoter, including the cAMP response element, in a time-dependent and glucose concentration-dependent manner. DNA methylation under experimental-high-glucose conditions was unique to the Ins1 promoter; however, palmitate did not affect DNA methylation. Artificial methylation of Ins1 promoter significantly suppressed promoter-driven luciferase activity, and a DNA methylation inhibitor significantly improved insulin mRNA suppression by experimental-high-glucose conditions. Experimental-high-glucose conditions significantly increased DNA methyltransferase activity and decreased ten-eleven-translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase activity. Oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulumstress did not affect DNA methylation of the Ins1 promoter. High glucose but not palmitate increased ectopic triacylglycerol accumulation parallel to DNA methylation. Metformin upregulated insulin gene expression and suppressed DNA methylation and ectopic triacylglycerol accumulation. Finally, DNA methylation of the Ins1 promoter increased in isolated islets from Zucker diabetic fatty rats. This study helps to clarify the effect of an over-nutrition state on DNA methylation of the Ins1 promoter in pancreatic beta cells.

Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKI) have marked therapeutic effects against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR mutations, but some patients have exhibited primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs. We recently reported that podoplanin-positive fi broblasts are associated with a tumor-promoting phenotype of CAFs in lung adenocarcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the susceptibility of NSCLC to EGFR-TKIs could be affected by podoplanin-expressing CAFs. Experimental Design: We evaluated the EGFR-TKI sensitivity of EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell lines cocultured with podoplanin-expressing CAFs. We also examined the association between the expression of podoplanin in CAFs in surgical specimens and EGFR-TKI response of postoperative recurrent patients with EGFR mutations (N = 106). Results: Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines became more resistant to EGFR-TKI when cocultured with podoplanin-expressing CAFs, compared with control CAFs in vitro. The knockdown of podoplanin expression on CAFs cancelled the resistance to EGFR-TKIs in cancer cells. Compared with control CAFs, the cancer cells that were cocultured with podoplanin-positive CAFs continued to exhibit significantly higher p-ERK levels after treatment with gefi tinib. Furthermore, postoperative recurrent patients with podoplanin-positive CAFs had a significantly lower overall response rate to EGFR-TKIs compared with those with podoplanin-negative CAFs (53% vs. 83%; P < 0.01). Conclusions: Podoplanin-positive CAFs play an important role in primary resistance to EGFR-TKIs and may be an ideal therapeutic target for use in combination therapy with EGFR-TKIs. ?2014 AACR.",,epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor kinase inhibitor; gefitinib; mitogen activated protein kinase; podoplanin; protein kinase B; adult; aged; Article; cancer associated fibroblast; cancer resistance; controlled study; disease activity; drug effect; drug response; EGFR gene; enzyme phosphorylation; female; fibroblast; gene function; gene identification; gene mutation; human; human cell; in vitro study; lung adenocarcinoma; lung carcinogenesis; major clinical study; male; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; molecular pathology; oncogene; phenotype; protein determination; protein expression; protein function; reoperation; tumor microenvironment; very elderly,2-s2.0-84964297901

We synthesized a novel photosensitizer, mannose-conjugated chlorin (M-chlorin), designed to bind mannose receptors highly expressed on TAMs. We evaluated the newly available photodynamic therapy (PDT) with M-chlorin against gastric and colon cancer. We evaluated PDT with M-chlorin for in vitro cytotoxicity and apoptosis induction in cancer cells compared with chlorin alone and glucose-conjugated chlorin (G-chlorin). The subcellular localization of M-chlorin was observed by confocal microscopy, and the M-chlorin PDT effects against TAMs including THP-1-induced M2-polarized macrophages were evaluated. Anticancer effects were also investigated in an allograft model where cytotoxic effects against TAMs in the cancer cell stroma were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. M-chlorin PDT strongly induced cell death in cancer cells to almost the same extent as G-chlorin PDT by inducing apoptosis. M-chlorin was incorporated into cancer cells where it localized mainly in lysosomes and endoplasmic reticula. M-chlorin PDT revealed strong cytotoxicity for M2 macrophages induced from THP-1 cell lines, and it induced stronger cytotoxicity than G-chlorin PDT in the allograft model through killing both cancer cells and TAMs in the cancer stroma.

DQB1*06:02 is common in the general population (10-30%); therefore, additional genetic factors are needed for the development of narcolepsy. In the present study, HLA-DQB1 in 664 Japanese narcoleptic subjects and 3131 Japanese control subjects was examined to determine whether HLA-DQB1 alleles located in trans of DQB1*06:02 are associated with narcolepsy. The strongest association was with DQB1*06:01 (P = 1.4 × 10-10, odds ratio, OR = 0.39), as reported in previous studies. Additional predisposing effects of DQB1*03:02 were also found (P = 2.5 × 10-9, OR = 1.97). A comparison between DQB1*06:02 heterozygous cases and controls revealed dominant protective effects of DQB1*06:01 and DQB1*05:01. In addition, a single-nucleotide polymorphism-based conditional analysis controlling for the effect of HLA-DQB1 was performed to determine whether there were other independent HLA associations outside of HLA-DQB1. This analysis revealed associations at HLA-DPB1 in the HLA class II region (rs3117242, P = 4.1 × 10-5, OR = 2.45; DPB1*05:01, P = 8.1 × 10-3, OR = 1.39).

While they may not be clinically diagnosed as depressed, nurses often suffer from depression and anxiety symptoms, which can lead to a low level of patient care. However, there is no rigorous evidence base for determining an effective prevention strategy for these symptoms in nurses. After reviewing previous literature, we chose a strategy of treatment with omega-3 fatty acids and a mindfulness-based stress management program for this purpose. We aim to explore the effectiveness of these intervention options for junior nurses working in hospital wards in Japan. Methods/Design: A factorial-design multi-center randomized trial is currently being conducted. A total of 120 nurses without a managerial position, who work for general hospitals and gave informed consent, have been randomly allocated to a stress management program or psychoeducation using a leaflet, and to omega-3 fatty acids or identical placebo pills. The stress management program has been developed according to mindfulness cognitive therapy and consists of four 30-minute individual sessions conducted using a detailed manual. These sessions are conducted by nurses with a managerial position. Participants allocated to the omega-3 fatty acid groups are provided with 1,200 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid and 600 mg/day of docosahexaenoic acid for 90 days. Discussion: An effective preventive intervention may not only lead to the maintenance of a healthy mental state in nurses, but also to better quality of care for inpatients. This paper outlines the background and methods of a randomized trial that evaluates the possible additive value of omega-3 fatty acids and a mindfulness-based stress management program for reducing depression in nurses. ? 2015 Watanabe et al.",Anxiety; Behavior therapy; Depression; Fatty acids; Mindfulness; Omega-3; Prevention and control,"docosahexaenoic acid; fish oil; icosapentaenoic acid; olive oil; rapeseed oil; soybean oil; omega 3 fatty acid; adult; algorithm; anxiety; Article; assessment of humans; automutilation; bradford somatic inventory; burnout; clinical effectiveness; cognitive therapy; consultation; disease severity; exercise; factorial design; female; friend; generalized anxiety disorder 7 item scale; health and work performance questionnaire; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; hygiene; informed consent; insomnia; Insomnia Severity Index; Japan; laughter; leisure; major depression; maslach burnout inventory; medical leave; mental health; mindfulness; mindfulness based stress management; multicenter study (topic); nurse; outcome assessment; oxidative stress; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; presenteeism; primary care evaluation of mental disorders algorithm; psychoeducation; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); sensitivity analysis; sleep; stress; stress management; telephone interview; ward; work; clinical protocol; clinical trial; controlled study; Depressive Disorder, Major; mental stress; multicenter study; nurse; psychology; randomized controlled trial; Anxiety; Clinical Protocols; Depressive Disorder, Major; Fatty Acids, Omega-3; Humans; Mindfulness; Nurses; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Oxidative Stress; Quality of Life; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-84924266320

However, long-term IFN-α treatment frequently causes depression, which limits its clinical utility. The precise molecular and cellular mechanisms of IFN-α-induced depression are not currently understood. Neural stem cells (NSCs) in the hippocampus continuously generate new neurons, and some evidence suggests that decreased neurogenesis plays a role in the neuropathology of depression. We previously reported that IFN-α treatment suppressed hippocampal neurogenesis and induced depression-like behaviors via its receptors in the brain in adult mice. However, it is unclear how systemic IFN-α administration induces IFN-α signaling in the hippocampus. In this study, we analyzed the role of microglia, immune cells in the brain, in mediating the IFN-α-induced neurogenic defects and depressive behaviors. In vitro studies demonstrated that IFN-α treatment induced the secretion of endogenous IFN-α from microglia, which suppressed NSC proliferation. In vivo treatment of adult mice with IFN-α for 5 weeks increased the production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN-α, and reduced neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Both effects were prevented by simultaneous treatment with minocycline, an inhibitor of microglial activation. Furthermore, minocycline treatment significantly suppressed IFN-α-induced depressive behaviors in mice.These results suggest that microglial activation plays a critical role in the development of IFN-α-induced depression, and that minocycline isa promising drug for the treatment of IFN-α-induced depression in patients, especially those who are low responders to conventional antidepressant treatments. ? 2015 Zheng, Kaneko and Sawamoto.",Depression; Hippocampus; Interferon; Microglia; Neurogenesis,alpha interferon; broxuridine; eomesodermin; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; Ki 67 antigen; minocycline; nestin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell activation; cell culture; cell proliferation; controlled study; depression; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; forced swim test; hippocampus; imaging; immunocompetent cell; immunocytochemistry; immunohistochemistry; male; microglia; mouse; nervous system development; neurologic disease; nonhuman; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; tail suspension test,2-s2.0-84922183823

A common assessment tool is the Vertigo Symptom Scale (VSS) -short form, which has two subscales: vestibular-balance and autonomic-anxiety. Despite frequent use, the factor structure of the VSS-short form has yet to be confirmed. Here, we clarified the factor structure of the VSS-short form, and assessed the validity and reliability of the Japanese version of this tool. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional, multicenter, psychometric evaluation of patients with non-central dizziness or vertigo persisting for longer than 1 month. Participants completed the VSS-short form, the Dizziness Handicap Inventory, and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. They also completed the VSS-short form a second time 1-3 days later. The questionnaire was translated into Japanese and cross-culturally adapted. We conducted a confirmatory factor analysis followed by an exploratory factor analysis. Convergent and discriminant validity, internal consistency, and test-retest reliability were evaluated. Results: The total sample and retest sample consisted of 159 and 79 participants, respectively. Model-fitting for a two-subscale structure in a confirmatory factor analysis was poor. An exploratory factor analysis produced a three-factor structure: long-duration vestibular-balance symptoms, short-duration vestibular-balance symptoms, and autonomic-anxiety symptoms. Regarding convergent and discriminant validity, all hypotheses were clearly supported. We obtained high Cronbach's aα coefficients for the total score and subscales, ranging from 0.758 to 0.866. Total score and subscale interclass correlation coefficients for test-retest reliability were acceptable, ranging from 0.867 to 0.897. Conclusions: The VSS-short form has a three-factor structure that was cross-culturally well-matched with previous data from the VSS-long version. Thus, it was suggested that vestibular-balance symptoms can be analyzed separately according to symptom duration, which may reflect pathophysiological factors. The VSS-short form can be used to evaluate vestibular-balance symptoms and autonomic-anxiety symptoms, as well as the duration of vestibular-balance symptoms. Further research using the VSS-short form should be required in other languages and populations. ? 2015 Kondo et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Anxiety; Dizziness; Factor analysis; Japanese; Psychosomatic medicine; Reliability; Validity; Vertigo; Vestibular disease,"adult; anxiety disorder; Article; autonomic dysfunction; clinical evaluation; disease assessment; disease duration; dizziness; Dizziness Handicap Inventory; female; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; neurologic disease assessment; reliability; reproducibility; vertigo; Vertigo Symptom Scale short form; aged; cross-sectional study; dizziness; factorial analysis; middle aged; psychology; psychometry; quality of life; questionnaire; standards; validation study; vertigo; Adult; Aged; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dizziness; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vertigo",2-s2.0-84938912908

Napsin A is a known diagnostic marker for lung adenocarcinoma, and expression of napsin A is reported in a certain portion of thyroid and renal carcinomas. However, napsin A expression in ovarian surface epithelial tumors has not previously been examined. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that in 71 of 86 ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma patients (83%) and all of the 13 patients with ovarian clear cell adenofibroma, positive napsin A staining was evident.

Furthermore, expression of napsin A was not observed in the normal surface epithelium of the ovary, epithelia of the fallopian tubes, squamous epithelium, endocervical epithelium, or the endometrium of the uterus.

However, the assessment and control of their tumorigenicity remains to be a critical challenge. Sensitive detection of the pluripotent cellular impurities is necessary for the safety and quality control of the hPSC-derived products. In the present study, we established a sensitive assay for detection of the residual undifferentiated hiPSCs in cardiomyocytes, using droplet digital PCR (ddPCR). The ddPCR method with a probe and primers for LIN28 significantly detected as low as 0.001% undifferentiated hiPSCs in primary cardiomyocytes, which is equivalent to the ratio of a single hiPSC to 1 × 105 cardiomyocytes. The ddPCR also showed that LIN28 expression is extremely low in human tissues including liver, heart, pancreas, kidney, spinal cord, corneal epithelium and lung.

Methods and Results-We conducted an observational study to investigate whether dietary sodium intake predicts future blood pressure and the onset of hypertension in the general population. Individual sodium intake was estimated by calculating 24-hour urinary sodium excretion from spot urine in 4523 normotensive participants who visited our hospital for a health checkup. After a baseline examination, they were followed for a median of 1143 days, with the end point being development of hypertension. During the follow-up period, hypertension developed in 1027 participants (22.7%). The risk of developing hypertension was higher in those with higher rather than lower sodium intake (hazard ratio 1.25, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.50). In multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, baseline sodium intake and the yearly change in sodium intake during the follow-up period (as continuous variables) correlated with the incidence of hypertension. Furthermore, both the yearly increase in sodium intake and baseline sodium intake showed significant correlations with the yearly increase in systolic blood pressure in multivariate regression analysis after adjustment for possible risk factors. Conclusions-Both relatively high levels of dietary sodium intake and gradual increases in dietary sodium are associated with future increases in blood pressure and the incidence of hypertension in the Japanese general population. ? 2015 The Authors.",Blood pressure; Diet; Hypertension; Lifestyle; Prediction; Salt,"sodium chloride; sodium intake; adult; aged; Article; blood pressure; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; diastolic blood pressure; female; follow up; human; hypertension; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; observational study; prediction; salt intake; sodium excretion; systolic blood pressure; adverse effects; Asian continental ancestry group; chi square distribution; comparative study; diet; epidemiology; ethnology; feeding behavior; hypertension; incidence; Japan; Kaplan Meier method; lifestyle; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; predictive value; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; risk factor; sodium intake; time factor; urinalysis; urine; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Pressure; Chi-Square Distribution; Diet; Feeding Behavior; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension; Incidence; Japan; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Life Style; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sodium, Dietary; Time Factors; Urinalysis",2-s2.0-85010382781

To enhance the repopulation efficacy, the human iPSC-HLCs were transduced with an adenovirus vector (Ad-FNK) expressing FNK, a hyperactive mutant gene from Bcl-xL, which was expected to inhibit apoptosis in the process of integration into liver parenchyma. We then transplanted Ad-FNK-transduced human iPSC-HLCs into urokinase-type plasminogen activator-transgenic severe combined immunodeficiency (uPA/SCID) mice (FNK mice) and evaluated the repopulation efficacy. The antiapoptotic effects of the human iPSC-HLCs were enhanced by FNK overexpression in vitro. Human albumin levels in the transplanted mice were significantly increased by transplantation of Ad-FNK-transduced human iPSC-HLCs (about 24,000 ng/ml). Immunohistochemical analysis with an anti-human aAT antibody revealed greater repopulation efficacy in the livers of FNK mice than control mice. Interestingly, the expression levels of human hepatocyte-related genes in the human iPSC-HLCs of FNK mice were much higher than those in the human iPSC-HLCs before transplantation. We succeeded in improving the repopulation efficacy of human liver chimeric mice generated by transplanting the Ad-FNK-transduced human iPSC-HLCs into uPA/SCID mice. Our method using ectopic expression of FNK was useful for generating human chimeric mice with high chimerism. ? 2015 Cognizant Comm.

Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) responds well to corticosteroid therapy (CST), and CST is essential to induce remission. However, the correlation between long-term outcome and CST has not been evaluated. We aimed to clarify the correlation between long-term outcome of AIP and CST. Material and methods. We retrospectively evaluated relapse, risk of malignancy and side effects of CST by focusing on the correlation with CST in 84 patients with type 1 AIP. Results. The incidence of relapse was 23.8%. The frequency of relapse after CST administration was significantly lower in patients taking CST for >6 months than in those who did not (22% versus 67%; p = 0.036). The incidence of malignancy was 10.7%. The standardized incidence ratio of malignancy was 2.14 [95% confidence interval 0.74–3.54]. There were no significant correlations between development of malignancy and CST. The incidences of total and serious side effects due to CST were 75% and 19.1%, respectively. Relapse was the only significant independent predictive risk factor for serious side effects in a multivariate analysis (odds ratio 4.065; 95% confidence interval 1.125–14.706; p = 0.032). The cumulative dose of corticosteroid was significantly higher in patients with serious side effects than in those without (12,645 mg versus 7322 mg; p = 0.041). Conclusions. CST reduces relapse of AIP. However, CST causes serious side effects, particularly in relapsing patients. Alternative maintenance therapy to prevent relapse is needed. ? 2015 Informa Healthcare.",Relapse; Risk of malignancy; Side effect of steroid therapy; Type 1 autoimmune pancreatitis,"corticosteroid; immunoglobulin G; glucocorticoid; immunoglobulin G; adult; aged; aorta aneurysm; Article; autoimmune pancreatitis; cancer incidence; cancer recurrence; cancer risk; cardiovascular disease; cataract; correlation analysis; corticosteroid therapy; diabetes mellitus; female; femur head necrosis; fracture; gastrointestinal disease; glaucoma; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; immunoglobulin blood level; infection; interstitial nephritis; major clinical study; male; moon face; obesity; outcome assessment; pancreatitis; priority journal; rash; relapse; retroperitoneal fibrosis; retrospective study; risk factor; sclerosing cholangitis; sialoadenitis; very elderly; Autoimmune Diseases; blood; classification; complication; incidence; middle aged; multivariate analysis; neoplasm; pancreatitis; receiver operating characteristic; recurrent disease; remission; statistical model; treatment outcome; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Autoimmune Diseases; Female; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Incidence; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasms; Pancreatitis; Recurrence; Remission Induction; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84979824654

This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of the dynamic jaw mode for tomotherapy of breast cancer. Static tomotherapy plans of the whole breast and supraclavicular regional lymph nodes, and plans for the whole breast only were generated in 25 patients with left-sided breast cancer. Plans with a field width of 2.5 or 5 cm with the dynamic or fixed jaw modes were made for each patient. The prescribed dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions. In whole breast and supraclavicular nodal radiotherapy, dose distributions and homogeneity of the planning target volume (PTV) with the dynamic jaw mode were slightly inferior to those with the fixed jaw mode with a 5-cm field width (P < .05). However, lung low-dose volumes and mean doses of the larynx, thyroid, skin, and all the healthy tissues combined were smaller with the dynamic jaw mode than with the fixed jaw mode with a 5-cm field width (P < .001). In whole breast radiotherapy, mean doses of the skin and healthy tissues were lower with the dynamic jaw mode than with the fixed jaw mode with a 5-cm field width (P < .001) without significant differences in PTV dose distributions, homogeneity, and conformity. The dynamic jaw mode provided better sparing of organs at risks with minimal disturbance of dose–volume indices of PTV. Considering the treatment time, the 5-cm-field dynamic jaw mode is more efficient than the 2.5-cm fixed jaw mode. ?

Current antitussives have limited efficacy and undesirable side-effects. Patients with chronic cough typically describe sensory symptoms suggestive of upper airway and laryngeal neural dysfunction. They often report cough triggered by low-level physical and chemical stimuli supporting the recently emerging concept of 'cough hypersensitivity syndrome'. Chronic cough is a neuropathic condition that could be secondary to sensory nerve damage caused by inflammatory, infective and allergic factors. Mechanisms underlying peripheral and central augmentation of the afferent cough pathways have been identified. Successful treatment of chronic cough with agents used for treating neuropathic pain, such as gabapentin and amitriptyline, would also support this concept. Further research of neuropathic cough may lead to the discovery of more effective antitussives in the future. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Amitryptiline; Chronic cough; Cough hypersensitivity syndrome; Gabapentin; Neuropathic pain; Sensory neuropathy,amitriptyline; antitussive agent; calcitonin gene related peptide; gabapentin; nerve growth factor; prostaglandin E2; purinergic P2X3 receptor; substance P; transient receptor potential channel A1; vanilloid receptor 1; Article; asthma; central nervous system; chronic cough; cough hypersensitivity syndrome; coughing; human; hypersensitivity; neuropathic cough; neuropathic pain; priority journal; protein expression; reflex; sensitization; sensory nerve; sensory neuropathy; animal; chronic disease; complication; Cough; hypersensitivity; pathophysiology; peripheral neuropathy; Animals; Chronic Disease; Cough; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases,2-s2.0-84959526074

Previously, we reported that hepatitis B virus (HBV) replication can induce physiological stress. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of chemokines produced by HBV-infected hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. A real-time PCR array targeting genes related to chemokines and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were carried out to detect the specific chemokines produced by Huh7 cells and HepG2 cells infected with various HBV genotypes. A migration assay, flow cytometry analysis, and immunohistochemistry were carried out to analyze the candidate immune cells that can affect the immunopathogenesis of HBV infection. The expressions of CX3CL1 mRNA and protein were significantly different among HBV genotypes A, B, and C and control cells (mock) (P&lt;0.05). CD56+ NK cells and CD8+ T cells migrated to the hepatoma cells with HBV replication. Moreover, the migration activity of both immune cells was partially cancelled after the treatment of CX3CL1 neutralizing antibody. The expression level of NKG2D on CX3CR1+ NK cells in HCC with HBV infection was significantly lower than that in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with HCV infection and chronic hepatitis B and C patients (P&lt;0.05).

We conducted an extended analysis of the pirfenidone trial to investigate its efficacy with respect to IPF severity in the trial population. Methods: Patients in the phase III trial were stratified by baseline pulmonary functions including %VC predicted, %diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide predicted, and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry on exertion and were categorized into mild, moderate, and severe groups of functional impairment. The efficacy of pirfenidone for VC and PFS over 52 weeks was compared among the three sub-populations. Results: Of 264 patients, 102 (39%), 90 (34%), and 72 patients (27%) were classified as having mild, moderate, and severe grades of functional impairment, respectively. This classification was associated with arterial oxygen partial pressure at rest and degree of dyspnea at baseline. While pirfenidone attenuated VC decline at all grades of severity, covariance analysis revealed pirfenidone to have better efficacy in the sub-population with mild-grade IPF. Mixed model repeated measures analysis confirmed that pirfenidone markedly attenuated VC decline in patients with mild-grade IPF compared to its effects in patients with moderate or severe IPF. Pirfenidone also improved PFS markedly in patients with mild-grade IPF. Conclusion: This extended analysis suggested that pirfenidone exerted better therapeutic effects in patients with milder IPF. Further analysis with a larger population is needed to confirm these results. ? 2015 The Japanese Respiratory Society.",Disease severity; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; Pirfenidone; Progression-free survival; Vital capacity,"pirfenidone; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; pirfenidone; pyridone derivative; Article; blood oxygen tension; carbon monoxide lung diffusion capacity; controlled study; disease classification; disease severity; drug efficacy; dyspnea; fibrosing alveolitis; human; Japan; lung diffusion capacity; lung function; major clinical study; oxygen saturation; phase 3 clinical trial; progression free survival; pulse oximetry; vital capacity; adult; aged; female; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis; male; middle aged; mortality; oxygen consumption; pathophysiology; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); retrospective study; severity of illness index; survival rate; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Aged; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Clinical Trials, Phase III as Topic; Female; Humans; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis; Male; Middle Aged; Oxygen Consumption; Pyridones; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; Vital Capacity; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84954197768

Methods The records of 40 children with PRES were reviewed. Acute clinical symptoms, MRI including apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps in the acute and follow-up periods and neurological sequelae, including epilepsy, were noted. Results Age at onset ranged from 2 to 16 years. Underlying disorders were hematological or neoplastic disorders (n = 20), renal diseases (n = 14) and others (n = 6). In the acute period, 31 patients had seizures, 25 had altered consciousness, 11 had visual disturbances and 10 had headache. Of 29 patients who had ADC maps in the acute period, 13 had reduced diffusivity as shown by ADC within PRES lesions. Of 26 patients with follow-up MRI, 13 had focal gliosis or cortical atrophy. No patients had motor impairment, and four patients had focal epilepsy. No clinical variables were associated with focal gliosis or cortical atrophy on follow-up MRI, but lesional ADC reduction in the acute period was prognostic for focal gliosis or cortical atrophy on follow-up MRI (p = 0.005). Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cohort study to date involving PRES in children. Acute symptoms in pediatric patients are similar to those reported in adults, but altered consciousness was more frequent in children. Lesional ADC reduction in the acute period was common and was a good predictor of later, irreversible MRI lesions. ? 2015 European Paediatric Neurology Society.",ADC; Brain edema; Diffusion-weighted MRI; Electroencephalogram; Epilepsy; Hypertension; Pediatrics; Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; Prognosis; Seizures,cyclosporin; tacrolimus; adolescent; Article; asthma; child; childhood disease; clinical article; controlled study; diffusion coefficient; female; focal epilepsy; follow up; gliosis; headache; hematologic disease; hemophagocytic syndrome; human; immunopathology; immunosuppressive treatment; kidney disease; male; mean arterial pressure; motor dysfunction; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; priority journal; prognosis; seizure; systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment duration; visual disorder; brain; cohort analysis; complication; neuroimaging; pathology; posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome; procedures; Adolescent; Brain; Child; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuroimaging; Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome,2-s2.0-84952864808

Recently, chemopreventive strategies using phytochemicals have gained considerable attention as an alternative in the management of cancer. The present study aimed to evaluate the chemopreventive effects of resveratrol (RV) and apocynin (AC) in N-Nitrosobis(2-oxopropyl)amine-induced pancreatic carcinogenesis in hamster. RV- and AC-treated hamsters showed significant reduction in the incidence of pancreatic cancer with a decrease in Ki-67 labeling index in dysplastic lesions. RV and AC suppressed cell proliferation of human and hamster pancreatic cancer cells by inhibiting the G1 phase of the cell cycle with cyclin D1 downregulation and inactivation of AKT-GSK3β and ERK1/2 signaling. Further, decreased levels of GSK3βSer9 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation and cyclin D1 expression in the nuclear fraction were observed in cells treated with RV or AC. Nuclear expression of phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 was also decreased in dysplastic lesions and adenocarcinomas of hamsters treated with RV or AC in vivo. These results suggest that RV and AC reduce phosphorylated GSK3βSer9 and ERK1/2 in the nucleus, resulting in inhibition of the AKT-GSK3β and ERK1/2 signaling pathways and cell cycle arrest in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, the present study indicates that RV and AC have potential as chemopreventive agents for pancreatic cancer.",Apocynin; GSK3β; Hamster; Pancreatic carcinogenesis; Resveratrol,"apocynin; bis(2 oxopropyl)nitrosamine; cyclin D1; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; Ki 67 antigen; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; protein kinase B; resveratrol; serine; acetophenone derivative; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; apocynin; glycogen synthase kinase 3; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; GSK3B protein, human; resveratrol; stilbene derivative; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer inhibition; carcinogenesis; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle G1 phase; cell nucleus; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; dysplasia; female; human; human cell; human tissue; in vivo study; labeling index; major clinical study; nonhuman; pancreas adenocarcinoma; pancreas cancer; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis inhibition; signal transduction; Syrian hamster; adenocarcinoma; animal; cell survival; chemoprophylaxis; disease model; drug effects; hamster; immunohistochemistry; Mesocricetus; metabolism; pancreas tumor; pathology; phosphorylation; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; Western blotting; Acetophenones; Adenocarcinoma; Animals; Anticarcinogenic Agents; Antioxidants; Blotting, Western; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Nucleus; Cell Survival; Chemoprevention; Cricetinae; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3; Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mesocricetus; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Phosphorylation; Stilbenes",2-s2.0-84952361972

Setting Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Nagoya, Japan, and the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland. Design Prospective comparative observational study. Methods Patients were enrolled who had cataract surgery with implantation of a yellow-tinted or colorless IOL and for whom images were obtained on which the fundus autofluorescence was measurable using the Heidelberg Retina Angiogram 2 postoperatively. The fundus autofluorescence in the images was classified into 8 abnormal patterns based on the classification of the International Fundus Autofluorescence Classification Group, The presence of normal fundus autofluorescence, geographic atrophy, and wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) also was recorded. The fundus findings at baseline and 2 years postoperatively were compared. Results Fifty-two eyes with a yellow-tinted IOL and 79 eyes with a colorless IOL were included. Abnormal fundus autofluorescence did not develop or increase in the yellow-tinted IOL group; however, progressive abnormal fundus autofluorescence developed or increased in 12 eyes (15.2%) in the colorless IOL group (P =.0016). New drusen, geographic atrophy, and choroidal neovascularization were observed mainly in the colorless IOL group. The incidence of AMD was statistically significantly higher in the colorless IOL group (P =.042). Conclusions Two years after cataract surgery, significant differences were seen in the progression of abnormal fundus autofluorescence between the 2 groups. The incidence of AMD was lower in eyes with a yellow-tinted IOL.

We compared nedaplatin plus docetaxel with cisplatin plus docetaxel in patients with previously untreated advanced or relapsed squamous cell lung carcinoma to determine effects on overall survival. Methods: We did a randomised, open-label, phase 3 study at 53 institutions in Japan. Eligibility criteria included pathologically proven squamous cell lung cancer with stage IIIB/IV or postoperative recurrence, age 20-74 years, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-1, no previous chemotherapy or recurrence more than a year after previous adjuvant chemotherapy, and adequate organ function. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to 100 mg/m2 nedaplatin and 60 mg/m2 docetaxel intravenously, or 80 mg/m2 cisplatin and 60 mg/m2 docetaxel, every 3 weeks for four to six cycles (at the treating oncologist's discretion). Randomisation was done centrally at the West Japan Oncology Group data centre via a computer-generated allocation sequence with dynamic minimisation that balanced stage (IIIB/IV or postoperative recurrent), sex, and institution. The primary endpoint was overall survival in the modified intention-to-treat population (ie, all patients who were randomly assigned and met the inclusion criteria). Safety analyses were done in all randomly assigned patients who received at least one dose of the study regimen. This trial is registered with the UMIN Clinical Trials Registry, number UMIN000002015, and is closed to new participants. Findings: Between July 6, 2009, and July 26, 2012, 355 patients were randomly assigned. 349 patients were included in the modified intention-to-treat analysis (177 in the nedaplatin group and 172 in the cisplatin group). Overall survival was significantly longer in the nedaplatin group (median 13·6 months, 95% CI 11·6-15·6) than in the cisplatin group (11·4 months,10·2-12·2; hazard ratio 0·81, 95% CI 0·65-1·02; p=0·037, one-sided stratified log-rank test). Grade 3 or worse nausea (seven of 177 patients in the nedaplatin group and 25 of 175 in the cisplatin group), fatigue (six vs 20), hyponatraemia (24 vs 53), and hypokalaemia (four vs 15) were more frequent in the cisplatin group than in the nedaplatin group, whereas grade 3 or worse leucopenia (98 vs 77), neutropenia (146 vs 123), and thrombocytopenia (16 vs none) were more frequent in the nedaplatin group than in the cisplatin group. Treatment-related deaths occurred in four and three patients in nedaplatin and cisplatin groups, respectively. Interpretation: Overall survival was significantly longer with nedaplatin plus docetaxel than with cisplatin plus docetaxel, and the regimens had different safety profiles. Nedaplatin plus docetaxel could be a new treatment option for advanced or relapsed squamous cell lung cancer.

However, the precise mechanism underlying the development of HBV-related diseases is not fully understood. In addition, the therapeutic strategies for the diseases are less than optimum. microRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that have been described as a “fine-tuner” in various cellular events. The dysregulation of miRNAs play a role in the development of the cancer as well as viral interference. Recent articles have demonstrated that several miRNAs are deregulated by HBV infection and contribute to viral replication and pathogenesis. Thus, it suggests that the precise mechanism between miRNA and HBV biology will be leading to the development of the novel diagnosis and therapy. This chapter aims to provide the basic principals of miRNAs in development of the HBV-related diseases. We also discuss about the possibility of miRNAs on the clinical application for diagnosis and therapy of HBVrelated diseases. ?

A challenge of drug development is the identification of small molecules that suppress HBV infection from new chemical sources. Here, from a fungusderived secondary metabolite library, we identify a structurally novel tricyclic polyketide, named vanitaracin A, which specifically inhibits HBV infection. Vanitaracin A inhibited the viral entry process with a submicromolar 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) (IC50 = 0.61 ± 0.23 μM), without evident cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration of &gt;256 μM; selectivity index value of&gt;419) in primary human hepatocytes. Vanitaracin A did not affect the HBV replication process. This compound was found to directly interact with the HBV entry receptor sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) and impaired its bile acid transport activity. Consistent with this NTCP targeting, antiviral activity of vanitaracin A was observed with hepatitis D virus (HDV) but not hepatitis C virus. Importantly, vanitaracin A inhibited infection by all HBV genotypes tested (genotypes A to D) and clinically relevant NA-resistant HBV isolate. Thus, we identified a fungal metabolite, vanitaracin A, which was a potent, well-tolerated, and broadly active inhibitor of HBV and HDV entry. This compound, or its related analogs, could be part of an antiviral strategy for preventing reinfection with HBV, including clinically relevant nucleos(t)ide analog-resistant virus. ? 2015, American Society for Microbiology.",,"antivirus agent; entecavir; sodium bile acid cotransporter; unclassified drug; vanitaracin A; cotransporter; molecular library; organic anion transporter; polyketide; primer DNA; sodium-bile acid cotransporter; vanitaracin A; antiviral activity; Article; binding affinity; concentration response; controlled study; drug receptor binding; drug structure; genotype; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; Hepatitis delta virus; human; human cell; nonhuman; priority journal; virus attachment; virus entry; virus inhibition; virus replication; cell line; chemistry; drug development; drug effects; genetics; hepatitis B; indirect fluorescent antibody technique; luminescence; metabolism; molecular library; physiology; procedures; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; surface plasmon resonance; Talaromyces; Cell Line; DNA Primers; Drug Discovery; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis Delta Virus; Humans; Luminescent Measurements; Organic Anion Transporters, Sodium-Dependent; Polyketides; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Small Molecule Libraries; Surface Plasmon Resonance; Symporters; Talaromyces; Virus Internalization",2-s2.0-84949674768

Because severe reflux esophagitis has very low prevalence in Japan, little is known about the effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors in these patients. This prospective multicenter study assessed the effectiveness of proton pump inhibitors for severe reflux esophagitis in Japan. Patients with modified Los Angeles grade C or D reflux esophagitis were treated with daily omeprazole (10 or 20 mg), lansoprazole (15 or 30 mg), or rabeprazole (10, 20, or 40 mg) for 8 weeks. Healing was assessed endoscopically, with questionnaires administered before and after treatment to measure the extent of reflux and dyspepsia symptoms. Factors affecting healing rates, including patient characteristics and endoscopic findings, were analyzed. Of the 115 patients enrolled, 64 with grade C and 19 with grade D reflux esophagitis completed the study. The healing rate was 67.5% (56/83), with 15 of the other 27 patients (55.6%) improving to grade A or B. No patient characteristic or endoscopic comorbidity was significantly associated with healing rate. Reflux and dyspepsia symptoms improved significantly with treatment.

Materials and methods We studied 560 patients with a history of RPL prospectively. We determined the obstetric significance of 11 commercially available tested assays for lupus anticoagulant (LA)-aPTT StaClot, phosphatidylserine-dependent antiprothrombin (aPS/PT) IgG, IgM, classical cardiolipin (CL) IgG, IgM, CL IgG, IgM, IgA, and β2glycoprotein I (β2GPI) IgG, IgM, IgA Phadia. Obstetric significance was defined as the potential for anticoagulant therapy to improve the subsequent live birth rate, or a difference in the live birth rate between positive and negative untreated cases. Results The LA-aPTT StaClot assay and aPS/PT IgG assay, but not CL IgG, were found to have obstetric significance. Our conventional tests covered positive cases with the aPS/PT IgM and classical CL IgG assays. The results of the LA-aPTT StaClot, LA-aPTT and LA-RVVT assays showed different distributions, although strong or moderate correlation was observed. Conclusion LA-aPTT StaClot and aPS/PT IgG might be suitable for use in routine practice for patients with RPL. Each test for aPL should be ascertained for obstetric significance, because similar assays may have different outcomes. ? 2015.

However, the overall analysis of chiral metabolomics is quite difficult due to the high number of metabolites, the significant diversity in their physicochemical properties, and concentration range from metabolite-to-metabolite. To solve this difficulty, we developed a novel approach for chiral metabolomics fingerprinting and chiral metabolomics extraction, which is based on the labeling of a pair of enantiomers of chiral derivatization reagents (i.e., DMT-(S,R)-Pro-OSu and DMT-3(S,R)-Apy) and precursor ion scan chromatography of the derivatives. The multivariate statistics is also required for this strategy. The proposed procedures were evaluated by the detection of a diagnostic marker (i.e., d-lactic acid) using the saliva of diabetic patients. This method was used for the determination of biomarker candidates of chiral amines and carboxyls in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain homogenates.

(-)-Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and chlorogenic acid (CGA), a major flavonoid in green tea and a major phenolic acid in coffee, respectively, have potent properties, including antioxidative effects. Our previous study demonstrated that p70 S6 kinase acts as a negative regulator in tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)-stimulated interleukin-6 synthesis in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. In the present study, the effects of EGCG and CGA on the TNF-α-stimulated interleukin-6 synthesis were investigated in MC3T3-E1 cells. EGCG and CGA significantly enhanced TNF-α-stimulated interleukin-6 release. In addition, the interleukin-6 mRNA expression levels induced by TNF-α were supported by EGCG, as well as CGA. EGCG markedly attenuated the TNF-α-induced phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase whereas CGA failed to affect the phosphorylation. These results strongly suggest that EGCG and CGA enhance the TNF-α -stimulated interleukin-6 synthesis in osteoblasts, and that the amplifying effect of EGCG, but not CGA, is exerted via inhibiting p70 S6 kinase. ?

The present study examined the possible chemopreventive effects of FBRA on N?nitrosobis(2?oxopropyl)amine (BOP)?induced pancreatic tumorigenesis in hamsters. Five?week?old male Syrian golden hamsters were divided into seven groups. Groups 1?5 were subcutaneously injected with BOP (10 mg/kg body weight) four times during week 6 to induce pancreatic tumors, while groups 6 and 7 were injected with saline. Groups 2 and 3 were fed diets containing 5 and 10% FBRA, respectively, during the initiation phase. By contrast, groups 4 and 5 were fed diets containing 5 and 10% FBRA, respectively, during the post?initiation phase. Group 6 received a diet containing 10% FBRA throughout the experiment, and group 7 was kept on the basal diet alone and served as the untreated control. At the termination of the study (week 22), oral intake of 10% FBRA (group 5) during the post?initiation phase was identified to have significantly reduced the multiplicity (number of lesions/animal) of ductal adenocarcinoma [pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (PanIN3); carcinoma in situ and invasive carcinoma] in comparison with group 1 control hamsters (0.24±0.44 vs. 0.71±0.72; P<0.05). Treatment with 10% FBRA in the post?initiation phase inhibited the progression of normal/precancerous lesions (PanIN1, mild hyperplastic lesions; and PanIN2, papillary hyperplasia) to ductal adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, dietary exposure to 10% FBRA during the initiation (group 3) and post?initiation phases (group 5) significantly reduced the multiplicity of PanIN2 (group 3, 0.55±0.69; group 5, 0.45±0.69; versus group 1, 1.26±1.24; P<0.05 and P<0.01, respectively). A significant reduction of Ki-67 positivity of PanIN2 in group 5 was also confirmed (group 5, 0.05±0.03; group 1, 0.22±0.12; P<0.01). Using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase?mediated dUTP nick end?labeling, augmentation of apoptosis by FBRA exposure in the non?lesional ductal epithelium and proliferative lesions was not evident. These findings indicate that FBRA exhibits inhibitory effects on BOP?induced pancreatic tumorigenesis in hamsters due to the reduced proliferation rate of tumor cells. Thus, FBRA may be a promising chemopreventive agent in human pancreatic cancer. ? 2015, Spandidos Publications.

Demographic parameters, operative variables, and perioperative outcome in the 2 groups were retrospectively collected, analyzed, and compared. Results: Patients in both groups had comparable preoperative characteristics.

We analyzed 15 tumors originally diagnosed as mWT (mWTlike tumors), 2 of which had concurrent MECs. We looked for the CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusion transcripts and performed immunohistochemistry for p63 and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the MAML2 split. To localize MAML2 split- positive cells at the cellular level, whole tumor tissue sections were digitalized (whole-slide imaging [WSI]). The CRTC1- MAML2, but not CRTC3-MAML2 was detected in 5/15 mWTlike tumors. FISH-WSI results showed that all epithelial cells harbored the MAML2 split in fusion-positive mWT-like tumors and were totally negative in fusion-negative mWT-like tumors. A review of the hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides showed that morphology of the ""metaplastic"" epithelium was virtually indistinguishable between fusion-positive and fusion-negative tumors. However, oncocytic bilayered tumor epithelium, characteristic to typical WT, was always found somewhere in the fusion-negative tumors but not in the fusion-positive tumors. This distinguishing histologic finding enabled 5 pathologists to easily differentiate the 2 tumor groups with 100% accuracy. The age and sex distribution of fusion-positive mWT-like tumor cases was similar to that of fusion-positive MEC cases and significantly different from those of fusion-negative mWT-like tumor and typical WT cases. In addition, only fusion-positive mWT-like tumors possessed concurrent low-grade MECs. In conclusion, a subset of mWT-like tumors were positive for the CRTC1-MAML2 fusion and had many features that are more in accord with MEC than with WT. The term Warthin-like MEC should be considered for fusion-positive mWT-like tumors. Copyright ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We previously reported that a bacterial metabolite butyric acid, acting as a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), could lead to induction of HIV-1 transcription; however, the molecular mechanism remains unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of butyric acid on HIV-1 gene expression. Methods: Butyric acid-mediated HIV-1 gene expression was determined by luciferase assay and Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay. Western blot analysis and ELISA were used for the detection of HIV-1. Results: We found that Sp1 binding sites within the HIV-1 promoter are primarily involved in butyric acid-mediated HIV-1 activation. In fact, Sp1 knockdown by small interfering RNA and the Sp1 inhibitor mithramycin A abolished the effect of butyric acid. We also observed that cAMP response element-bindingbinding protein (CBP) was required for butyric acid-induced HIV-1 activation. Conclusions: These results suggest that butyric acid stimulates HIV-1 promoter through inhibition of the Sp1-associated HDAC activity and recruitment of CBP to the HIV-1 LTR. Our findings suggest that Sp1 should be considered as one of therapeutic targets in anti-viral therapy against HIV-1 infection aggravated by butyric acid-producing bacteria. Copyright ? 2015 S.

Methods: Ten eyes (8 patients) with diffuse DME diagnosed using fluorescein angiography (FA) and refractory to a sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide (STTA), grid laser photocoagulation, or both were enrolled. FA and ICGA were performed using the Heidelberg Retina Angiograph 2. Hyperfluorescent spots on early-phase FA and on early-and late-phase ICGA were superimposed onto the macular thickness map measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and counted to calculate the spot density in the area with or without macular edema (ME). ICGA-guided focal laser photocoagulation was carried out. In 7 eyes, STTA was simultaneously performed. The central macular thickness (CRT) and macular volume (MV) were measured by OCT. Results: On early-phase FA, 4.8 ± 2.3 and 2.3 ± 1.5 hyperfluorescent spots/disk area were observed inside and outside the ME, respectively. In contrast, the spot density was significantly decreased to 1.8 ± 0.9 inside the ME and was only 0.3 ± 0.4 outside the ME on late-phase ICGA (p < 0.01). The mean follow-up period after ICGA-guided photocoagulation was 19.0 months. The mean best-corrected visual acuity improved significantly from 0.77 ± 0.34 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution at baseline to 0.52 ± 0.37 at the last visit (p < 0.01). Both CRT and MV significantly decreased (p < 0.01). Recurrence of DME was observed in 4 eyes: 3 eyes were treatable only with STTA and 1 required additional ICGA-guided laser photocoagulation.

Methods and results We analysed 329 healthy adult subjects prospectively included in 10 centres and a validation group of 377 patients with left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD). LA myocardial functionwas analysed by LA strain rate peak during LA contraction (LA-SRa) and LA strain peak during LA relaxation (LA-Strain). The range of values of LA myocardial function in healthy subjectswas LA-SRa 22.11±0.61 s-1 and LA-Strain 45.5±11.4%, and the lowest expected values of these LA analyses (calculated as 21.96 SD from the mean of healthy subjects) were LA-SRa 20.91 s-1 and LA-Strain 23.1%. Concerning the clinical relevance of these LA myocardial analyses, LA-SRa and LA-Strain detected subtle LA dysfunction in patients with LVDD, even though LA volumetric measurements were normal. In addition, in these patients we found that the functional class (dyspnoea-NYHA classification) was inversely related to both LA-Strain and LA-SRa. Conclusion In the present multicentre study analysing a large cohort of healthy subjects and patients with LVDD, the normal range and the clinical relevance of the myocardial function of the LA using 2DSTE have been determined. ?

Tumors with a CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP), a distinct subgroup with extensive DNA methylation, show characteristic features in the case of colorectal cancer. The relationship between TET inactivation and CIMP in colorectal cancers is not well understood. The expression level of TET family genes was compared between CIMP-positive (CIMP-P) and CIMP-negative (CIMP-N) colorectal cancers. Furthermore, DNA methylation profiling, including assessment of the TET1 gene, was assessed in colorectal cancers, as well as colon polyps. The TET1 was silenced by DNA methylation in a subset of colorectal cancers as well as cell lines, expression of which was reactivated by demethylating agent. TET1 methylation was more frequent in CIMP-P (23/55, 42%) than CIMP-N (2/113, 2%, P < 0.0001) colorectal cancers. This trend was also observed in colon polyps (CIMP-P, 16/40, 40%; CIMP-N, 2/24, 8%; P = 0.002), suggesting that TET1 methylation is an early event in CIMP tumorigenesis. TET1 methylation was significantly associated with BRAF mutation but not with hMLH1 methylation in the CIMP-P colorectal cancers. Colorectal cancers with TET1 methylation have a significantly greater number of DNA methylated genes and less pathological metastasis compared to those without TET1 methylation (P = 0.007 and 0.045, respectively). Our data suggest that TET1 methylation may contribute to the establishment of a unique pathway in respect to CIMP-mediated tumorigenesis, which may be incidental to hMLH1 methylation. In addition, our findings provide evidence that TET1 methylation may be a good biomarker for the prediction of metastasis in colorectal cancer. ?2015 AACR.",,"B Raf kinase; protein; ten eleven translocation 1; ten eleven translocation 2; ten eleven translocation 3; unclassified drug; DNA binding protein; messenger RNA; oncoprotein; TET1 protein, human; tumor marker; aged; Article; clinical feature; colon carcinogenesis; colon polyp; colorectal cancer; controlled study; CpG island; cpg island methylator phenotype positive; DNA methylation; female; gene expression; genetic association; human; human cell; human tissue; major clinical study; male; metastasis; multigene family; phenotype; priority journal; protein expression; somatic mutation; cancer staging; cell transformation; colloid carcinoma; colorectal tumor; CpG island; follow up; gene expression regulation; genetics; mutation; pathology; prognosis; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; tumor cell culture; Western blotting; Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Blotting, Western; Cell Transformation, Neoplastic; Colorectal Neoplasms; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Mutation; Neoplasm Staging; Phenotype; Prognosis; Proto-Oncogene Proteins; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-84942065023

There is no standard management of reactivation of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection in HBVresolved patients without hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but with antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen and/or antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs). Methods. We conducted a prospective observational study to evaluate the occurrence of HBV reactivation by serial monthly monitoring of HBV DNA and to establish preemptive therapy guided by this monitoring in B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) treated with rituximab plus corticosteroid-containing chemotherapy (R-steroidchemo). The primary endpoint was the incidence of HBV reactivation defined as quantifiable HBV DNA levels of ?11 IU/mL. Results. With a median HBV DNA follow-up of 562 days, HBV reactivation was observed in 21 of the 269 analyzed patients. The incidence of HBV reactivation at 1.5 years was 8.3% (95% confidence interval, 5.5-12.4). No hepatitis due to HBV reactivation was observed in patients who received antiviral treatment when HBV DNA levels were between 11 and 432 IU/mL. An anti-HBs titer of <10 mIU/mL and detectable HBV DNA remaining below the level of quantification at baseline were independent risk factors for HBV reactivation (hazard ratio, 20.6 and 56.2, respectively; P < .001). Even in 6 patients with a rapid increase of HBV due to mutations, the monthly HBV DNA monitoring was effective at preventing HBV-related hepatitis. Conclusions. Monthly monitoring of HBV DNA is useful for preventing HBV reactivation-related hepatitis among B-NHL patients with resolved HBV infection following R-steroid-chemo (UMIN000001299).",HBV DNA monitoring; HBV reactivation; Preemptive antiviral therapy; Resolved HBV infection; Rituximab,"corticosteroid; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; hepatitis B surface antibody; pirarubicin; prednisolone; prednisone; rituximab; vincristine; virus DNA; antivirus agent; virus DNA; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; antibody titer; antiviral therapy; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; B cell lymphoma; drug fatality; female; gene mutation; Hepatitis B virus; human; infectious complication; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; multiple cycle treatment; nonhodgkin lymphoma; observational study; overall survival; priority journal; prospective study; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; risk factor; septic shock; vaccination; virus reactivation; blood; complication; genetics; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Lymphoma, B-Cell; middle aged; virology; Aged; Antiviral Agents; DNA, Viral; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Lymphoma, B-Cell; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies",2-s2.0-84942038524

Design: Cluster randomised trial. Setting: 40 groups from 17 healthcare divisions in Japan: companies (31), communities (6) and mixed settings (3). Participants: Participants aged 20-65 years with fasting plasma glucose (FPG) of 5.6-6.9 mmol/L were invited from the 17 healthcare divisions. Randomisation: The groups were then randomly assigned to an intervention or a control arm by independent statisticians according to a computergenerated list. Intervention: The intervention arm received a 1-year telephone-delivered intervention provided by three private lifestyle support centres (at different frequencies: low-frequency (3 times), middle-frequency (6 times) and high-frequency (10 times) support calls). The intervention and control arms both received selfhelp devices such as a weight scale and pedometer. Outcomes: Participants were followed up using data from annual health check-ups and a questionnaire regarding lifestyle. The primary outcome was the development of T2DM defined as FPG ?7.0 mmol/L, the diagnosis of diabetes, or use of an antidiabetic drug, confirmed by referring to medical cards. Results: Of 14 473 screened individuals, participants were enrolled in either the intervention (n=1240) arm or control (n=1367) arm. Overall, the HR for the development of T2DM in the intervention arm during 5.5 years was 1.00 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.34). In the subanalysis, the HR was 0.59 (95% CI 0.42 to 0.83) in the subgroup that received phone calls the most frequently, compared with the control arm.

However, the impact of antiphosholipid antibodies (aPL) in the pregnancy outcomes of asymptomatic aPL carriers is uncertain. The aim of this systematic review is to assess whether primary prophylaxis is beneficial to prevent obstetric complications during pregnancy in asymptomatic women positive for aPL who have no history of recurrent pregnancy loss or intrauterine fetal death. Methods Studies evaluating the effect of prophylactic treatment versus no treatment in asymptomatic pregnant aPL carriers were identified in an electronic database search. Design, population and outcome homogeneity of studies was assessed and meta-analysis was performed. The pooled Mantel-Haenszel relative risk of specific pregnancy outcomes was obtained using random effects models. Heterogeneity was measured with the I2 statistic. All analyses were conducted using Review Manager 5.3. Results Data from five studies involving 154 pregnancies were included and three studies were meta-analysed. The risk ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) of live birth rates, preterm birth, low birth weight and overall pregnancy complications in treated and untreated pregnancies were 1.14 (0.18-7.31); 1.71 (0.32-8.98); 0.98 (0.07-13.54) and 2.15 (0.63-7.33),respectively. Results from the meta-analysis revealed that prophylactic treatment with aspirin is not superior to placebo to prevent pregnancy complications in asymptomatic aPL carriers. Conclusion This systematic review did not find evidence of the superiority of prophylactic treatment with aspirin compared to placebo or usual care to prevent unfavourable obstetric outcomes in otherwise healthy women with aPL during the first pregnancy. ? 2015 Author(s).",anticardiolipin antibodies; aspirin; lupus anticoagulant; obstetric outcome; Pregnancy morbidity,"acetylsalicylic acid; heparin; phospholipid antibody; placebo; prednisone; cardiolipin antibody; phospholipid antibody; antiphospholipid syndrome; birth rate; fetus death; human; live birth; low birth weight; meta analysis; pregnancy complication; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; primary prevention; primigravida; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); recurrent abortion; Review; systematic review; systemic lupus erythematosus; antiphospholipid syndrome; female; immunology; pathophysiology; pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; primary prevention; procedures; Antibodies, Anticardiolipin; Antibodies, Antiphospholipid; Antiphospholipid Syndrome; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Outcome; Primary Prevention",2-s2.0-84941209295

While the human leukocyte antigen ( HLA). -DRB1*15:01-DQB1*06:02 haplotype is strongly associated with narcolepsy, it is not sufficient for disease development. To identify additional, non-. HLA susceptibility genes, we conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) using Japanese samples.An initial sample set comprising 409 cases and 1562 controls was used for the GWAS of 525,196 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located outside the HLA region. An independent sample set comprising 240 cases and 869 controls was then genotyped at 37 SNPs identified in the GWAS. We found that narcolepsy was associated with a SNP in the promoter region of chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 1 (CCR1) (rs3181077, P=1.6×10-5, odds ratio [OR]=1.86). This rs3181077 association was replicated with the independent sample set (P=0.032, OR=1.36). We measured mRNA levels of candidate genes in peripheral blood samples of 38 cases and 37 controls. CCR1 and CCR3 mRNA levels were significantly lower in patients than in healthy controls, and CCR1 mRNA levels were associated with rs3181077 genotypes. In vitro chemotaxis assays were also performed to measure monocyte migration. We observed that monocytes from carriers of the rs3181077 risk allele had lower migration indices with a CCR1 ligand.CCR1 and CCR3 are newly discovered susceptibility genes for narcolepsy. These results highlight the potential role of CCR genes in narcolepsy and support the hypothesis that patients with narcolepsy have impaired immune function. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc..",Chemokine receptor; Complex traits; Genome-wide association study; Microglia; Narcolepsy; Neuroinflammation,"chemokine receptor CCR1; chemokine receptor CCR3; HLA DPB1 antigen; messenger RNA; CCR1 protein, human; CCR3 protein, human; chemokine receptor CCR1; chemokine receptor CCR3; allele; Article; blood sampling; CCR1 gene; CCR3 gene; cell migration; chemotaxis; controlled study; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic identification; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; haplotype; heterozygote; HLA DQB1 gene; human; human cell; Japanese (people); major clinical study; monocyte; narcolepsy; priority journal; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; Asian continental ancestry group; genetics; genome-wide association study; Japan; narcolepsy; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Japan; Narcolepsy; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Receptors, CCR1; Receptors, CCR3",2-s2.0-84940597465

Methods Among 262 children with acute encephalopathy/encephalitis registered in a database of the Tokai Pediatric Neurology Society between 2005 and 2012, 44 were diagnosed with AESD according to the clinical course and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings and were included in this study. Medical records were reviewed to investigate clinical data, MRI findings, neurologic outcomes, and presence or absence of PEE. Seizure types of PEE were determined by both clinical observation by pediatric neurologists and ictal video-electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. Results Of the 44 patients after AESD, 10 (23%) had PEE. The period between the onset of encephalopathy and PEE ranged from 2 to 39 months (median 8.5 months). Cognitive impairment was more severe in patients with PEE than in those without. Biphasic seizures and status epilepticus during the acute phase of encephalopathy did not influence the risk of PEE. The most common seizure type of PEE on clinical observation was focal seizures (n = 5), followed by epileptic spasms (n = 4), myoclonic seizures (n = 3), and tonic seizures (n = 2). In six patients with PEE, seizures were induced by sudden unexpected sounds. Seizure types confirmed by ictal video-EEG recordings were epileptic spasms and focal seizures with frontal onset, and all focal seizures were startle seizures induced by sudden acoustic stimulation. Intractable daily seizures remain in six patients with PEE. Significance We demonstrate seizure characteristics of PEE in children after AESD. Epileptic spasms and startle focal seizures are common seizure types. The specific seizure types may be determined by the pattern of diffuse subcortical white matter injury in AESD and age-dependent reorganization of the brain network. ?

Research regarding the appropriate PRO questionnaires to use is informative. A previously published latent class analysis (LCA) examined patterns of function, symptoms, and supportive care needs in a sample of US cancer patients. The current analysis investigated whether the findings from the original study were replicated in new samples from different countries and whether a larger sample combining all the data would affect the classes identified. Methods: This secondary analysis of data from 408 Japanese and 189 Canadian cancer patients replicated the methods used in the original LCA using data from 117 US cancer patients. In all samples, subjects completed the EORTC-QLQ-C30 and Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form-34 (SCNS-SF34). We first dichotomized individual function, symptom, and need domain scores. We then performed LCA to investigate the patterns of domains for each of the outcomes, both in the individual country samples and then combining the data from all three samples. Results: Across all analyses, class assignment was made by level of function, symptoms, or needs. In individual samples, only two-class models (“high” vs. “low”) were generally identifiable while in the combined sample, three-class models (“high” vs. “moderate” vs. “low”) best fit the data for all outcomes. Conclusions: In this analysis, the level of burden experienced by patients was the key factor in defining classes. ? 2014, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Cancer; Latent class analysis; Patient-reported outcomes; Quality of life; Supportive care needs,adult; Article; breast cancer; Canadian; cancer fatigue; cancer pain; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; cognition; colorectal cancer; constipation; controlled study; diarrhea; dyspnea; emotion; European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire; female; functional status; health care need; human; insomnia; Japanese (people); loss of appetite; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; nausea and vomiting; physical activity; prostate cancer; quality of life; quality of life assessment; secondary analysis; self report; social status; Supportive Care Needs Survey Short Form 34; symptom; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; Canada; cultural anthropology; health service; middle aged; neoplasm; pathophysiology; questionnaire; social support; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Canada; Culture; Female; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Social Support,2-s2.0-84937512058

Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 126 consecutive patients who underwent uncovered SEMS placement for malignant GOO between April 2010 and March 2013 at a university hospital and two tertiary care referral centers. Results: Technical success of SEMS placement was achieved in all 126 (100%) patients. Improved oral intake was observed in 111 (88.1%) patients.

Currently, there are no biomarkers that can be used to diagnose asbestos exposure. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether the levels or detection rate of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 3 (CCL3) in the serum are elevated in persons exposed to asbestos. The primary study group consisted of 76 healthy subjects not exposed to asbestos and 172 healthy subjects possibly exposed to asbestos. The secondary study group consisted of 535 subjects possibly exposed to asbestos and diagnosed with pleural plaque (412), benign hydrothorax (10), asbestosis (86), lung cancer (17), and malignant mesothelioma (10). All study subjects who were possibly exposed to asbestos had a certificate of asbestos exposure issued by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. For the primary study group, levels of serum CCL3 did not differ between the two groups. However, the detection rate of CCL3 in the serum of healthy subjects possibly exposed to asbestos (30.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.001) than for the control group (6.6%). The pleural plaque, benign hydrothorax, asbestosis, and lung cancer groups had serum CCL3 levels and detection rates similar to that of healthy subjects possibly exposed to asbestos. The CCL3 chemokine was detected in the serum of 9 of the 10 patients diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma. Three of the patients with malignant mesothelioma had exceptionally high CCL3 levels. Malignant mesothelioma cells from four biopsy cases and an autopsy case were positive for CCL3, possibly identifying the source of the CCL3 in the three malignant mesothelioma patients with exceptionally high serum CCL3 levels. In conclusion, a significantly higher percentage of healthy persons possibly exposed to asbestos had detectable levels of serum CCL3 compared to healthy unexposed control subjects. ? 2015 The Authors.",Asbestos; Biological markers; Chemokine CCL3; Environmental carcinogens; Mesothelioma,"asbestos; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; mesothelin; asbestos; carcinogen; CCL3 protein, human; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; asbestosis; cell proliferation; comparative study; controlled study; disease severity; exposure; female; human; human cell; human experiment; human tissue; hydrothorax; limit of detection; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; malignant mesothelioma; mesothelioma cell line; middle aged; normal human; pleura plaque; priority journal; protein analysis; protein blood level; protein expression; scoring system; smoking habit; upregulation; blood; case control study; chemically induced; environmental exposure; lung tumor; mesothelioma; Adult; Aged; Asbestos; Carcinogens; Case-Control Studies; Chemokine CCL3; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mesothelioma; Middle Aged; Tumor Markers, Biological",2-s2.0-84936986342

Malondialdehyde-modified low-density lipoprotein (MDA-LDL) was suggested as a marker of endothelial damage. This study investigated the diagnostic impact of MDA-LDL on ergonovine-induced coronary spasms. Methods: We included 152 patients with suspected coronary spastic angina. MDA-LDL levels were measured before an ergonovine provocation test. Coronary spasm was defined as total or subtotal occlusion, compared to the relaxed state after nitroglycerin, associated with ischemic ECG changes and concurrent chest pain. Changes in vessel diameter in response to ergonovine were evaluated with quantitative coronary angiography. Results: Coronary spasms were observed in 41 patients (27%). MDA-LDL levels were significantly higher in patients with spasms compared to those without spasms (139.9 ± 45.9 U/L vs. 109.6 ± 36.6 U/L, p < 0.01). Univar-iate logistic regression analyses indicated significant relationships between coronary spasms and MDA-LDL (per 10 U/L, odds ratio (OR): 1.20; p < 0.01), high-density lipoprotein (per 10 mg/dL, OR: 0.76; p = 0.03), smoking (OR: 3.04; p < 0.01), and male gender (OR: 3.51; p < 0.01). In the multivariate model, MDA-LDL (per 10 U/L, OR: 1.17; p < 0.01) remaineda significant predictor of coronary spasm. Regression analysis showedapositive correlation between MDA-LDL levels and coronary luminal diameter changes induced by ergonovine (r = 0.57, p < 0.01). The optimal MDA-LDL threshold for predicting coronary spasm was 121.3 U/L, identified with a receiver operating characteristic curve.

In ovarian cancer cases, recurrence after chemotherapy is frequently observed, suggesting the involvement of ovarian cancer stem-like cells (CSCs). The chemoresistance of ovarian clear cell carcinomas is particularly strong in comparison to other epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes. We investigated the relationship between a CSC marker, aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1), and clinical prognosis using ovarian clear cell carcinoma tissue samples. Furthermore, we investigated the antioxidant mechanism by which CSCs maintain a lower reactive oxygen species (ROS) level, which provides protection from chemotherapeutic agents. Methods. Immunohistochemical stainingwas performed to examine the CSC markers (CD133, CD44, ALDH1) using ovarian clear cell carcinoma tissue samples (n=81). Clear cell carcinoma cell lines (KOC-7C, OVTOKO) are separated into the ALDH-high and ALDH-low populations by ALDEFLUOR assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). We compared the intracellular ROS level, mRNA level of the antioxidant enzymes and Nrf2 expression of the two populations. Results. High ALDH1 expression levels are related to advanced stage in clear cell carcinoma cases. ALDH1 expression significantly reduced progression free survival. Other markers are not related to clinical stage and prognosis. ALDH-high cells contained a lower ROS level than ALDH-low cells. Antioxidant enzymes were upregulated in ALDH-high cells. ALDH-high cells showed increased expression of Nrf2, a key transcriptional factor of the antioxidant system. Conclusions. ALDH-positive CSCs might have increased Nrf2-induced antioxidant scavengers, which lower ROS level relevant to chemoresistance in ovarian clear cell carcinoma. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Aldehyde dehydrogenase; Cancer stem-like cell; Chemoresistance; Nrf2-antioxidant pathway; Ovarian clear cell carcinoma; Reactive oxygen species,"aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1; CD133 antigen; glutathione peroxidase 3; heme oxygenase 1; Hermes antigen; manganese superoxide dismutase; messenger RNA; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor Nrf2; aldehyde dehydrogenase isoenzyme 1; isoenzyme; reactive oxygen metabolite; retinal dehydrogenase; adenocarcinoma cell line; adult; advanced cancer; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer survival; cell count; cell level; clear cell carcinoma; controlled study; down regulation; drug resistance; early cancer; enzyme activity; enzyme inhibition; female; fluorescence activated cell sorting; follow up; gene overexpression; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; middle aged; ovarian cancer cell line; ovary carcinoma; oxidative stress; priority journal; progression free survival; protein expression; protein induction; signal transduction; upregulation; adenocarcinoma; aged; cancer stem cell; enzymology; metabolism; neoplasm; ovary tumor; pathology; prognosis; tumor cell line; very elderly; Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell; Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell; Adult; Adult; Aged; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aged, 80 and over; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Female; Humans; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Immunohistochemistry; Isoenzymes; Isoenzymes; Middle Aged; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Neoplastic Stem Cells; Ovarian Neoplasms; Ovarian Neoplasms; Prognosis; Prognosis; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reactive Oxygen Species; Retinal Dehydrogenase; Retinal Dehydrogenase",2-s2.0-84933279818

We retrospectively reviewed microbiological results and clinical data to identify patients who were diagnosed with pulmonary MAC disease at Kyoto University Hospital in Japan between 2000 and 2013. NTM were isolated from 6327 of 80,285 samples (7.9%) for mycobacterial culture. The proportion of NTM isolates among all mycobacterial isolates increased from 355 of 792 samples (44.8%) in 2000 to 688 of 847 samples (81.2%) in 2013. MAC was most frequently observed (5436 isolates, 85.9%), followed by Mycobacterium abscessus (175 isolates, 2.8%) and Mycobacterium kansasii (74 isolates, 1.2%). A total of 592 patients with pulmonary MAC disease were identified (age, 66.0±11.5 years; females, 61.1%).

Curcumin, obtained from the rhizome of Curcuma longa, has potent anticancer activity. To date, no study has examined the interaction of PhIP with curcumin in breast epithelial cells. The present study demonstrates the mechanisms by which curcumin inhibits PhIP-induced cytotoxicity in normal breast epithelial cells (MCF-10A). Curcumin significantly inhibited PhIP-induced DNA adduct formation and DNA double stand breaks with a concomitant decrease in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. The expression of Nrf2, FOXO targets; DNA repair genes BRCA-1, H2AFX and PARP-1; and tumor suppressor P16 was studied to evaluate the influence on these core signaling pathways. PhIP induced the expression of various antioxidant and DNA repair genes. However, co-treatment with curcumin inhibited this expression. PhIP suppressed the expression of the tumor suppressor P16 gene, whereas curcumin co-treatment increased its expression. Caspase-3 and -9 were slightly suppressed by curcumin with a consequent inhibition of cell death. These results suggest that curcumin appears to be an effective anti-PhIP food additive likely acting through multiple molecular targets. ? 2015.",Cancer prevention; DNA adduct; DNA damage; Heterocyclic amines; Phytochemicals; Reactive oxygen species,"2 amino 1 methyl 6 phenylimidazo[4,5 b]pyridine; BRCA1 protein; caspase 3; caspase 9; curcumin; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor FOXO; transcription factor Nrf2; 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo(4,5-b)pyridine; antioxidant; curcumin; DNA adduct; imidazole derivative; reactive oxygen metabolite; apoptosis; Article; breast epithelium cell; cell death; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA adduct; double stranded DNA break; drug efficacy; drug mechanism; drug targeting; enzyme inhibition; gene expression; H2AFX gene; human; human cell; PARP 1 gene; priority journal; protein expression; tumor suppressor gene; cell line; cell protection; dose response; drug effects; epithelium cell; gene expression regulation; mammary gland; metabolism; oxidative stress; pathology; signal transduction; Curcuma longa; Antioxidants; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Apoptosis; Cell Line; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Cell Survival; Curcumin; Curcumin; Cytoprotection; Cytoprotection; DNA Adducts; DNA Adducts; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Epithelial Cells; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Humans; Imidazoles; Imidazoles; Mammary Glands, Human; Mammary Glands, Human; Oxidative Stress; Oxidative Stress; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-84930819651

Nutritional information is mostly perceived by peripheral organs before being relayed to the brain, which modulates physiological responses. Hormonal signaling ensures this organ-to-organ communication, and the failure of endocrine regulation in humans can cause diseases including obesity and diabetes. In Drosophila melanogaster, the fat body (adipose tissue) has been suggested to play an important role in coupling growth with nutritional status. Here, we show that the peripheral tissue-derived peptide hormone CCHamide-2 (CCHa2) acts as a nutrient-dependent regulator of Drosophila insulin-like peptides (Dilps). A BAC-based transgenic reporter revealed strong expression of CCHa2 receptor (CCHa2-R) in insulin-producing cells (IPCs) in the brain. Calcium imaging of brain explants and IPC-specific CCHa2-R knockdown demonstrated that peripheral-tissue derived CCHa2 directly activates IPCs. Interestingly, genetic disruption of either CCHa2 or CCHa2-R caused almost identical defects in larval growth and developmental timing. Consistent with these phenotypes, the expression of dilp5, and the release of both Dilp2 and Dilp5, were severely reduced. Furthermore, transcription of CCHa2 is altered in response to nutritional levels, particularly of glucose. These findings demonstrate that CCHa2 and CCHa2-R form a direct link between peripheral tissues and the brain, and that this pathway is essential for the coordination of systemic growth with nutritional availability. A mammalian homologue of CCHa2-R, Bombesin receptor subtype-3 (Brs3), is an orphan receptor that is expressed in the islet β-cells; however, the role of Brs3 in insulin regulation remains elusive. Our genetic approach in Drosophila melanogaster provides the first evidence, to our knowledge, that bombesin receptor signaling with its endogenous ligand promotes insulin production. ? 2015 Sano et al.",,"amide; bombesin receptor; bombesin receptor subtype 3; Drosophila insulin like peptide; neuropeptide; peptide hormone; unclassified drug; bombesin receptor; bombesin receptor subtype 3; CCH-amide-2 neuropeptide, Drosophila; Dilp5 protein, Drosophila; Drosophila protein; insulin; insulin derivative; neuropeptide; olfactory receptor; animal cell; Article; cell activation; controlled study; developmental disorder; dilp5 gene; Drosophila melanogaster; gene; growth regulation; insulin synthesis; larval development; molecular imaging; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; phenotype; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein synthesis; regulatory mechanism; signal transduction; animal; biosynthesis; brain; Drosophila melanogaster; fat pad; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; metabolism; olfactory receptor; transgenic animal; Drosophila melanogaster; Mammalia; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Fat Body; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Humans; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Insulins; Neuropeptides; Receptors, Bombesin; Receptors, Odorant",2-s2.0-84930793028

In this progress report, we present data collected in the first year to summarize selected maternal and infant characteristics. Methods: In the 15 Regional Centers located throughout Japan, the expectant mothers were recruited in early pregnancy at obstetric facilities and/or at local government offices issuing pregnancy journals. Self-administered questionnaires were distributed to the women during their first trimester and then again during the second or third trimester to obtain information on demographic factors, physical and mental health, lifestyle, occupation, environmental exposure, dwelling conditions, and socioeconomic status. Information was obtained from medical records in the first trimester and after delivery on medical history, including gravidity and related complications, parity, maternal anthropometry, and infant physical examinations. Results: We collected data on a total of 9819 expectant mothers (mean age = 31.0 years) who gave birth during 2011. There were 9635 live births. The selected infant characteristics (singleton births, gestational age at birth, sex, birth weight) in the JECS population were similar to those in national survey data on the Japanese general population. Conclusions: Our final birth data will eventually be used to evaluate the national representativeness of the JECS population. We hope the JECS will provide valuable information on the impact of the environment in which our children live on their health and development. ? 2015 Takehiro Michikawa et al.",Birth cohort; Children; Environmental chemicals; Japan; Pregnant women,"pollutant; adult; adverse effects; cohort analysis; Congenital Abnormalities; environmental exposure; environmental health; female; human; infant welfare; Japan; male; newborn; pollutant; pregnancy; toxicity; young adult; Adult; Cohort Studies; Congenital Abnormalities; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Infant Welfare; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Male; Maternal Exposure; Pregnancy; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84930738487

The recently described fusions, t(11;19)(q21;p13) CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein)-regulated transcription coactivator 1 and MAML2, mastermind-like gene 2 (CRTC1-MAML2) and t(11:15)(q21;q26) CRTC3-MAML2 characterize a considerable proportion of MEC examples arising from a variety of anatomical sites. Recent data point out that the aberrant proteins produced by this fusion drive oncogenesis by disrupting the cAMP/CREB and NOTCH1 pathways. To date, only 2 TMEC cases have been reported to have MAML2 rearrangements, a feature that was found to be absent in TMEC mimics. These findings led the authors to recommend this test as a diagnostic tool in the differential diagnosis for thymic carcinoma. Herein, we present a case of TMEC arising in a 58-year-old woman, which was predominantly cystic with intracystic papillary formations composed of a mixture of mucinous cells and intermediate/epidermoid eosinophilic cells. This case was negative for CTCR1-MAML2 and CTCR3-MAML2 fusion transcripts by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and lacked a MAML2 rearrangement by fluorescence in situ hybridization. We report a CTCR1/3-MAML2 fusion and MAML2 rearrangement-negative TMEC, indicating that a different molecular pathway must be involved in the generation of these tumors. The possibility of fusion-negative TMEC should be taken into consideration in the differential diagnosis of a thymic carcinoma. ?

Materials and Methods Patients with PAVMs who underwent embolization and met the following inclusion criteria were included: (a) embolization was performed using bare or fibered platinum microcoils or both, (b) the complete cessation of flow was confirmed by digital subtraction angiography, and (c) follow-up examinations were conducted with time-resolved MR angiography or pulmonary angiography. Coil embolization was performed in 16 patients with 24 untreated or reperfused PAVMs. Sac embolization was performed for 12 untreated PAVMs. Feeding artery embolization was performed as primary embolization in each of the 12 reperfused PAVMs. Five PAVMs were treated 2 to 4 times because of reperfusion. The study included 32 coil embolizations. Follow-up images were reviewed, and reperfusion rates were assessed. The relationships between reperfusion and the location of PAVM, size of PAVM (feeding artery and venous sac), coils (number and total length), timing of embolization (primary or repeat embolization), and types of coils used (with or without fibered coils) were examined. Results Reperfusion rates at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months were 8%, 27%, 36%, and 49%, respectively, for the 12 untreated PAVMs (primary embolization) and 50%, 50%, 92%, and 100%, respectively, for the 12 reperfused PAVMs (repeat embolization) (P =.0062).

This study aimed to examine the cost-effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia consisting of four weekly individual sessions. Methods We conducted a 4-week randomized controlled trial with a 4-week follow up in outpatient clinics in Japan. Thirty-seven patients diagnosed as having major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV and suffering from chronic insomnia were randomized to receive either treatment as usual (TAU) alone or TAU plus cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Effectiveness was evaluated as quality-adjusted life years (QALY) over 8 weeks' time, estimated by bootstrapping of the observed total scores of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. Direct medical costs for cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia and TAU were also evaluated. We calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Results Over the 8 weeks of the study, the group receiving cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia plus TAU had significantly higher QALY (P = 0.002) than the TAU-alone group with an incremental value of 0.019 (SD 0.006), and had non-significantly higher costs with an incremental value of 254 (SD 203) USD in direct costs. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was 13 678 USD (95% confidence interval: -5691 to 71 316). Adding cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia demonstrated an approximately 95% chance of gaining one more QALY if a decision-maker was willing to pay 60 000 USD, and approximately 90% for 40 000 USD. Conclusion Adding cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is highly likely to be cost-effective for patients with residual insomnia and concomitant depression. ? 2014 The Authors.

We investigated the post-transfusion transmission of hepatitis E in a patient by molecularly confirming its presence, and characterized the viral kinetics of HEV in this case. Methods: A Japanese man underwent re-thoracotomy for hemostasis followed by platelet transfusion. After the transfusion, the blood donor was found to be HEV positive. The donated blood was re-examined and was found to contain HEV. Throughout the prospective follow up of the patient, we analyzed the viral kinetics, chronological anti-HEV antibody level changes and disease progression during the entire course of HEV infection from transfusion until the end of viremia. Results: Sequence analysis of the strains isolated from both the donor and the patient who contracted acute hepatitis E showed an identical match for 326nucleotides in open reading frame 1. Two strains belonged to HEV genotype 3 indigenous to Japan. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first detailed report on the entire natural course of hepatitis E from viral transmission, then clearance, to replication preceding liver injury caused by HEV genotype 3, which is responsible for autochthonous infection in developed countries. The findings provide valuable insights into the mechanism of the transfusion transmission of HEV and subsequent viral dynamics. ? 2014 The Japan Society of Hepatology.",Genotype; Hepatitis E virus; Hepatitis E virus RNA; Transfusion-transmitted hepatitis,hepatitis E antibody; virus RNA; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; blood donor; blood transfusion; child; clinical article; developed country; disease course; disease transmission; genotype; heart tamponade; hepatitis E; Hepatitis E virus; human; Japan; Japanese (people); liver injury; male; priority journal; prospective study; school child; sequence analysis; thoracotomy; thrombocyte transfusion; transfusion transmitted hepatitis E; viremia; virus replication; virus strain; virus transmission,2-s2.0-84930249078

Because the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a substrate of Aβ, and β-secretase and γ-secretase complex proteins, which process APP to generate Aβ, are all membrane proteins, it is possible to assume that alterations in brain lipid metabolism modulate APP and/or Aβ metabolism. However, the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in Aβ metabolism remains unknown. We report here that 9 months-treatment of Tg2576 mice with arachidonic acid (ARA)-containing (ARA+) diet prevented brain Aβ deposition in 17-month-old Tg2576 mice. APP processing to generate soluble APPα, CTF-β, and Aβ synthesis was attenuated in Tg2576 mice fed with the ARA+ diet. These findings suggest that ARA+ diet could prevent Aβ deposition through the alteration of APP processing in Tg2576 mice. ? 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: A total of 1334 consecutively recruited lung cancer patients were selected, and data on cancer-related variables, demographic characteristics, health behaviors, physical symptoms and psychological factors consisting of personality traits and coping styles were obtained. The participants were divided into groups with or without a significant anxiety using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety, and a binary logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors correlated with significant anxiety using a multivariate model. Results: Among the recruited patients, 440 (33.0%) had significant anxiety. The binary logistic regression analysis revealed a coefficient of determination (overall R2) of 39.0%, and the explanation for psychological factors was much higher (30.7%) than those for cancer-related variables (1.1%), demographic characteristics (2.1%), health behaviors (0.8%) and physical symptoms (4.3%). Four specific factors remained significant in a multivariate model. A neurotic personality trait, a coping style of helplessness/hopelessness, and a female sex were positively correlated with significant anxiety, while a coping style of fatalism was negatively correlated. Conclusions: Our hypothesis was supported, and anxiety was strongly linked with personality trait and coping style. As a clinical implication, the use of screening instruments to identify these factors and intervention for psychological crisis may be needed. ? The Author 2015. Published by Oxford University Press.

To investigate fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), a rare genetic disease leading to extraskeletal bone formation through endochondral ossification, gene-corrected (rescued) iPSC clones (resFOP-iPSC) were generated from patient-derived iPSC (FOP-iPSC) as genetically matched controls, and the stepwise induction method of mesenchymal stromal cells (iMSCs) through neural crest cell (NCC) lineage was used to recapitulate the disease phenotype. FOP-iMSCs possessing enhanced chondrogenic ability were transcriptionally distinguishable from resFOP-iMSCs and activated the SMAD1/5/8 and SMAD2/3 pathways at steady state. Using this method, we identified MMP1 and PAI1 as genes responsible for accelerating the chondrogenesis of FOP-iMSCs.

Objectives To evaluate whether ME-NBI adds additional information to white-light imaging (WLI) for the diagnosis of invasion depth of SESCC. Design Multicenter, prospective trial using real-time imaging and diagnosis. Setting Seven Japanese institutions. Patients Fifty-five patients with SESCC were enrolled from June 2011 to October 2013, and the results for 49 lesions were analyzed. Interventions Patients underwent primary WLI followed by ME-NBI, and reports of primary WLI (WLI alone) were completed before secondary ME-NBI (WLI followed by ME-NBI). To standardize diagnosis among examiners, this trial was started after achievement of a mean κ value ?.6 among 11 participating endoscopists. Main Outcome Measurements Diagnosis of invasion depth by each tool was divided into cancer limited to the epithelium and the lamina propria mucosa and cancer invading beyond the muscularis mucosae (?T1a-MM) and then collated with the final pathologic diagnosis by an independent pathologist blinded to the clinical data. Results The accuracy of invasion depth in WLI alone and WLI followed by ME-NBI was 71.4% and 65.3% (P =.375), respectively. Sensitivity for ?T1a-MM was 61.1% for both groups (P = 1.000), and specificity for ?T1a-MM was 77.4% for WLI alone and 67.7% for WLI followed by ME-NBI (P =.375). Limitation Open-label trial. Conclusions ME-NBI showed no additional benefit to WLI for diagnosis of invasion depth of SESCC.

We have taken advantage of a murine model of human primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), mice expressing a transforming growth factor (TGF)-β receptor II dominant negative (dnTGF-βRII) transgene to address the potential therapeutic efficacy of CTLA-4 Ig. To mimic patients with PBC at different stages or duration of disease, we treated mice with either CTLA-4 Ig or control IgG three times weekly from 3 to 12 or 24 weeks of age, or from 12 to 24 weeks of age. CTLA-4 Ig treatment from 3 weeks of age significantly reduced liver inflammation to 12 weeks of age. Treatment initiated at 12 weeks of age also ameliorated the autoimmune cholangitis at 24 weeks of age. However, in mice treated at 3 weeks of age, suppression of liver inflammation was not sustained and colitis was aggravated when treatment was extended to 24 weeks of age. Our data indicate that, in dnTGF-βRII mice, CTLA-4 Ig treatment has short-term beneficial effects on autoimmune cholangitis, but the effect varies according to duration of treatment and the time in which therapy was initiated. Further dissection of the events that lead to the reduction in therapeutic effectiveness of CTLA-4 Ig will be critical to determining whether such efforts can be applied to human PBC. ? 2015 British Society for Immunology.",Autoimmunity; Cholangitis; Colitis; Murine models; Primary biliary cirrhosis,"abatacept; CD4 antigen; CD8 antigen; gamma interferon; immunoglobulin G; interleukin 4; mitochondrion antibody; transforming growth factor beta receptor 2; tumor necrosis factor alpha; autoantibody; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; immunoglobulin; immunoglobulin G; protein serine threonine kinase; transforming growth factor beta receptor; transforming growth factor-beta type II receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody detection; antiinflammatory activity; Article; autoimmune cholangitis; autoimmune cholangitis; autoimmune disease; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cholangitis; colitis; controlled study; disease duration; drug efficacy; hepatitis; lymphocyte count; mouse; natural killer T cell; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; T lymphocyte activation; Th1 Th2 balance; animal; Autoimmune Diseases; autoimmunity; blood; cholangitis; disease model; drug effects; genetics; immunology; liver; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; mitochondrion; pathology; T lymphocyte subpopulation; time; transgenic mouse; Animals; Autoantibodies; Autoimmune Diseases; Autoimmunity; Cholangitis; CTLA-4 Antigen; Disease Models, Animal; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulins; Liver; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Mitochondria; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Receptors, Transforming Growth Factor beta; T-Lymphocyte Subsets; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84929300853

Here, combining two large sets of high-throughput sequencing data, we delineate the entire picture of genetic alterations and affected pathways in these glioma types, with sensitive detection of driver genes. Grade II and III gliomas comprise three distinct subtypes characterized by discrete sets of mutations and distinct clinical behaviors. Mutations showed significant positive and negative correlations and a chronological hierarchy, as inferred from different allelic burdens among coexisting mutations, suggesting that there is functional interplay between the mutations that drive clonal selection. Extensive serial and multi-regional sampling analyses further supported this finding and also identified a high degree of temporal and spatial heterogeneity generated during tumor expansion and relapse, which is likely shaped by the complex but ordered processes of multiple clonal selection and evolutionary events. ? 2015 Nature America, Inc.",,isocitrate dehydrogenase; allele; Article; astrocytoma; brain surgery; cancer grading; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer surgery; clonal evolution; controlled study; copy number variation; correlational study; cytoarchitecture; gene expression; gene identification; glioblastoma; glioma; high throughput sequencing; histopathology; human; human tissue; major clinical study; multiple cancer; overall survival; pilocytic astrocytoma; priority journal; signal transduction; somatic mutation; tumor growth; tumor localization; brain tumor; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic predisposition; genetics; glioma; Kaplan Meier method; mortality; mutation; Brain Neoplasms; DNA Copy Number Variations; Gene Frequency; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Glioma; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Mutation; Neoplasm Grading,2-s2.0-84929129626

ETV6 is frequently involved in other epithelial and nonepithelial tumors, and many fusion partners of ETV6 have been reported. In the present study, 14 Japanese MASC cases were clinicopathologically and molecularly analyzed. The median age of the patients was 39 years, and the male:female ratio was 6:8. All cases showed histopathologic findings compatible with those previously described for MASC and harbored an ETV6 split as visualized by fluorescence in situ hybridization. Two cases showed thick fibrous septa and invasive features including vascular or perineural tumor involvement, findings that are rare in MASC. In addition, in these 2 cases, non-NTRK3 genes appeared to fuse with ETV6 (ETV6-X fusion). NTRK1 and NTRK2, both members of the NTRK family, were not involved. Of the 14 MASC cases, the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcript was positive in 6 cases, and the relative expression level of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcript was variable, ranging from 1 to 5.8. Results of the present study of MASC suggest that (1) ETV6 occasionally fuses with unknown non-NTRK3 genes, (2) ETV6-X cases might have an invasive histology, (3) for molecular diagnosis of MASC, fluorescence in situ hybridization to detect ETV6 splits is the method of choice, and (4) the expression level of the ETV6-NTRK3 fusion transcript is considerably variable. These findings provide a novel insight into the oncogenesis, histopathology, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of this newly recognized carcinoma. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods A total of 72 consecutive patients with MHBO treated by endoscopic bilateral SIS deployment were enrolled. The 8-mm and 10-mm diameter SEMSs were used in 37 patients (8-mm group) and 35 patients (10-mm group), respectively. We retrospectively compared technical success, functional success, complications, successful re-intervention, time to recurrent biliary obstruction (RBO) and survival time between two groups. Results There were no significant inter-group differences in terms of technical success (8-mm vs. 10-mm group, both 100%), functional success (96% vs. 100%), early (5% vs. 9%) and late (19% vs. 14%) complications other than RBO, and successful endoscopic re-intervention (94% vs. 100%), respectively. Time to RBO (median: 198 days vs. 222 days; log-rank, P=0.440) and survival time (median: 186 days vs. 235 days; log-rank, P=0.883) did not differ significantly between the two groups. However, the success rate of endoscopic bilateral revisionary stent insertion for RBO was significantly higher in the 10-mm compared to the 8-mm group (68% vs. 31%; P=0.044).

To test this hypothesis, we applied Libet's clock paradigm to Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Thirteen PD patients and 13 age-matched, healthy controls took part in the experiment which consisted of three judgment paradigms: W, M and S judgment. In W and M judgments, subjects were asked to press the key at self-willed timing. In W judgment, subjects reported the location of the clock's hand when they became aware of the intention (W-time). In M judgment, subjects reported the time when they became aware of the actual movement (M-time). In S judgment, subjects reported the time of the electrical stimulation given to their hand (S-time). W-time was significantly shorter in PD patients than in healthy control subjects while M-time and S-time were not different between the two groups. Delayed awareness of motor intention but not of action in PD patients might be related to dopamine depletion in those patients. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd and the Japan Neuroscience Society.",Libet clock task; Motor intention; Parkinson disease,carbidopa plus levodopa; dopamine; levodopa; aged; Article; awareness; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; decision making; electromyogram; electrostimulation; female; human; male; Mini Mental State Examination; motor control; motor intention; movement (physiology); neurologic disease assessment; Parkinson disease; perception; priority journal; task performance; thalamocortical tract; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; behavior; middle aged; movement (physiology); Parkinson disease; psychology; psychomotor performance; Aged; Awareness; Female; Humans; Intention; Judgment; Male; Middle Aged; Movement; Parkinson Disease; Psychomotor Performance,2-s2.0-84928203832

In an effort to identify more potent and well-tolerated agents for myeloma, we have previously reported that 1′-acetoxychavicol acetate (ACA), a natural condiment from South-East Asia, induces apoptotic cell death of myeloma cells in vitro and in vivo through inhibition of NF-κB-related functions. Searching for more potent NF-κB inhibitors, we developed several ACA analogs based on quantitative structure-activity relationship analysis. TM-233, one of these ACA analogs, inhibited cellular proliferation and induced cell death in various myeloma cell lines with a lower IC<inf>50</inf> than ACA. Treatment with TM-233 inhibited constitutive activation of JAK2 and STAT3, and then downregulated the expression of anti-apoptotic Mcl-1 protein, but not Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. In addition, TM-233 rapidly decreased the nuclear expression of NF-κB and also decreased the accumulation of cytosolic NF-κB. We also examined the effects of TM-233 on bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells that we recently established, KMS-11/BTZ and OPM-2/BTZ. TM-233, but not bortezomib, inhibited cellular proliferation and induced cell death in KMS-11/BTZ and OPM-2/BTZ cells. Interestingly, the combination of TM-233 and bortezomib significantly induced cell death in these bortezomib-resistant myeloma cells through inhibition of NF-κB activity. These results indicate that TM-233 could overcome bortezomib resistance in myeloma cells mediated through different mechanisms, possibly inhibiting the JAK/STAT pathway. In conclusion, TM-233 might be a more potent NF-κB inhibitor than ACA, and could overcome bortezomib resistance in myeloma cells. ? 2015 The Authors.

Previous studies have shown that balance training is effective in improving physical function and decreasing risk of falls. However, little attention has been given specifically to balance training in older adults with very poor balance. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of a 12-week customized balance exercise program on LOS for community-dwelling older women with poor balance ability. Twenty-four older women with poor balance (composite maximum excursion [MXEcomp] score of less than 70% based on Limits of Stability) were divided into an exercise group and control group. After 12?weeks of balance exercises, mean MXEcomp improved (p?<?.05) from 58.6% to 79.0% in the exercise group. EPEcomp (composite endpoint excursion), RTcomp (composite reaction time), SVcomp3 (composite sway velocity on thick foam with the eyes open), UG (up and go) also improved, but the functional reach and other static balance indexes did not change. These results indicated that balance training allows older adults with poor balance to improve dynamic balance ability and potentially reduce risk for falls. ? , Copyright ?

Materials and Methods: We conducted a single-arm multicenter prospective phase II trial at 20 Japanese medical facilities. Eligible patients had histologically confirmed uterine carcinosarcoma without prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Patients received 6 courses of 175 mg/m2 paclitaxel over 3 hours, followed by a 30-minute intravenous administration of carboplatin at an area under the serum concentration-time curve of 6. Results: A total of 51 patients were enrolled in this study, 48 of whom underwent complete resection and 3 of whom underwent optimal resection. At 2 years, the progression-free survival and overall survival rates were 78.2% (95% confidence interval [CI], 64.1%Y87.3%) and 87.9% (95% CI, 75.1%Y94.4%), respectively.

We categorized patients into two treatment cohorts: pre-novel agent era (1995-2006) and novel agent era (2008-2011). The combined percentage of pre-ASCT complete response and very good partial response cases (463 of 988, 47%) significantly increased during the novel agent era compared with the pre-novel agent era (164 of 527, 31%; P < 0.0001). The 2-year overall survival (OS) rate of 87% during the novel agent era was a significant improvement relative to that of 82% during the pre-novel agent era (P = 0.019). Although significant differences in OS were found among ISS stages during the pre-novel agent era, no significant difference was observed between ISS I and II (P = 0.107) during the novel agent era. The factors independently associated with a superior OS were female gender (P = 0.002), a good performance status (P = 0.024), lower ISS (P < 0.001), pre-ASCT response at least partial response (P < 0.001) and ASCT during the novel agent era (P = 0.017). These results indicate that the response rate and OS were significantly improved, and the ISS could not clearly stratify the prognoses of Japanese patients with MM who underwent upfront single ASCT during the novel agent era. ? 2014 The Authors.

In order to elucidate the disease-specific sociomedical factors, we further sub-analyzed the medication adherence in 237 psoriasis patients and compared it with that in other dermatological diseases such as atopic dermatitis, urticaria or tinea. This study was conducted among patients registered in monitoring system and 3096 eligible patients were enrolled. Our web-based questionnaire included the following items such as age, sex, annual income, main health-care institution, experience of effectiveness by oral or topical medication, overall satisfaction with treatment, and MMAS-8 for oral or topical medication. Mean adherence score by MMAS-8 was 5.2 for oral and 4.3 for topical medication. More patients with psoriasis used a university hospital and fewer used a private clinic compared with those with the other skin disease patients. Experience of drug effectiveness by oral medication and overall satisfaction with treatment was lower in psoriasis patients than in other patients. In oral medication, significantly better adherence was observed in those of higher age and with higher annual income. The adherence to medication, especially to topical drugs, was poor in 237 psoriasis patients. We speculated that some severe psoriasis patients were not sufficiently treated systemically and were resistant to topical therapy, leading to poor adherence. ? 2015 Japanese Dermatological Association.",Adherence; Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8; Psoriasis; Sociomedical factor; Treatment satisfaction,"antipsoriasis agent; dermatological agent; adult; age; aged; Article; assessment of humans; drug efficacy; female; human; income; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; Morisky Medication Adherence Scale 8; patient satisfaction; private hospital; psoriasis; questionnaire; topical treatment; university hospital; Japan; middle aged; patient satisfaction; psoriasis; Skin Diseases; statistics and numerical data; topical drug administration; very elderly; young adult; Administration, Topical; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Dermatologic Agents; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Psoriasis; Skin Diseases; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84926523058

Normotensive subjects who visited our hospital for a physical checkup (n = 6205, men 61.8%, 53.4 ± 11.4 years old) were enrolled in this study. Urine samples were collected for the measurement of albumin concentration, expressed as the ratio of urinary albumin to creatinine concentrations (UACR [mg/g Cr]). After the baseline examination, subjects were followed up for a median of 1089 days with the endpoint being the development of hypertension. Urinary albumin was in the normal range (UACR <30mg/g Cr) in most subjects (97.5%). During the follow-up, hypertension developed in 1184 subjects (19.1%, 69.5 per 1000 person-years), withmore men than women affected. The incidence of hypertension was increased across the quartiles of UACR by Kaplan-Meier analysis (log-rank, P < 0.0001) and the hazard ratio (lowest quartile [median UACR 1.14mg/g Cr] as reference) was 1.53 (95% confidence intervals 1.30-1.80) in the highest quartile (median UACR 8.87 mg/g Cr). Multivariate Cox hazard analysis in which UACR was taken as a continuous variable identified UACR as a significant predictor of hypertension (hazard ratio 1.37, 95% CI 1.20-1.56). UACR was also an independent predictor of future increases in systolic blood pressure (P < 0.01). Urinary albumin is an independent predictor of hypertension and increases in blood pressure in the general population even in the normal range below the threshold defined for microalbuminuria.

The authors analyzed the association between clinical parameters of the patients and their prognosis. Recurrence rate of during an average of 2 years after discharge was 21.3%, and there were differences among stroke subtypes. It was found that the disability level of the patients after discharge correlated well with the level at discharge (rs = 0.66). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the data shows that modified Rankin Scale score, National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score, gender, age, and family history had statistically significant impacts on stroke recurrence, and the impact was different depending on subtypes.

Either the reactivation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) or diabetic mononeuropathy has been proposed to cause the facial paralysis observed in DM patients. However, distinguishing whether the facial palsy is caused by herpetic neuritis or diabetic mononeuropathy is difficult. We previously reported that facial paralysis was aggravated in DM mice after HSV-1 inoculation of the murine auricle. In the current study, we induced HSV-1 reactivation by an auricular scratch following DM induction with streptozotocin (STZ). Study Design Controlled animal study. Methods Diabetes mellitus was induced with streptozotocin injection in only mice that developed transient facial nerve paralysis with HSV-1. Recurrent facial palsy was induced after HSV-1 reactivation by auricular scratch. Results After DM induction, the number of cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3)+ T cells decreased by 70% in the DM mice, and facial nerve palsy recurred in 13% of the DM mice. Herpes simplex virus type 1 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) was detected in the facial nerve of all of the DM mice with palsy, and HSV-1 capsids were found in the geniculate ganglion using electron microscopy. Herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA was also found in some of the DM mice without palsy, which suggested the subclinical reactivation of HSV-1. Conclusions These results suggested that HSV-1 reactivation in the geniculate ganglion may be the main causative factor of the increased incidence of facial paralysis in DM patients. ? 2014 The American Laryngological, Rhinological and Otological Society, Inc.",Bell's palsy; diabetes mellitus; herpes simplex virus; HSV-1 reactivation,"streptozocin; virus DNA; virus DNA; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; CD3+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; eyelid reflex; facial nerve; facial nerve paralysis; female; Herpes simplex virus 1; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; rough endoplasmic reticulum; spleen; transmission electron microscopy; vibrissa; virus reactivation; analysis of variance; animal; Bagg albino mouse; complication; disease model; experimental diabetes mellitus; facial nerve paralysis; flow cytometry; herpes simplex; Herpes simplex virus 1; nonparametric test; pathogenicity; pathology; procedures; randomization; sensitivity and specificity; severity of illness index; virology; virus activation; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Disease Models, Animal; DNA, Viral; Facial Paralysis; Female; Flow Cytometry; Geniculate Ganglion; Herpes Simplex; Herpesvirus 1, Human; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Random Allocation; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index; Statistics, Nonparametric; Virus Activation",2-s2.0-84925393313

The V600E-specific inhibitor vemurafenib has marked clinical activity in patients with BRAF V600E-mutated melanoma. However, there are many cases of resistance to vemurafenib. This may be due to the reported intra-tumor heterogeneity of the BRAF V600E mutation in primary melanomas. BRAF mutations are found in 1-5% of non-small cell carcinomas (NSCLCs), almost exclusively in adenocarcinoma. A few cases have been reported in which vemurafenib was effective against BRAF V600E-mutated lung cancers. In a previous study, five lung adenocarcinomas with BRAF V600E mutation were detected by direct sequencing. The present study analyzed these tumors for the percentage of mutation (%mutation) by competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (CAST-PCR) assay. In addition, sections of all components of the adenocarcinomas were obtained by laser microdissection and analyzed. The %mutations of BRAF V600E within the macrodissected tumors (cases 1-5) were: Case 1, 10.0%; case 2, 8.0%; case 3, 8.9%; case 4, 21.5%; and case 5, 14.9%. In four cases (cases 2-5), the %mutations of each adenocarcinoma component were as follows: Case 2, lepidic growth 6.5-24.5%, papillary 1.3-11.2% and acinar 9.8%; case 3, solid 2.5-69.9%, acinar 12.4-27.1% and papillary 3.7-17.4%; case 4, acinar 10.0-45.0% and papillary 44.0%; and case 5, papillary 3.7-93.4%. Sensitive BRAF mutation detection methods were used and evidence for heterogeneity of the BRAF V600E mutation in these lung adenocarcinoma cases was observed. Targeted therapy with a BRAF V600E inhibitor such as vemurafenib may have potential in the treatment of lung cancer with this mutation; however, it is necessary to consider how the treatment effect of and drug resistance to BRAF V600E inhibitors are affected by the presence of heterogeneity in future studies. ? 2015, Spandidos Publications.

We previously showed that the C-terminal region (CTR) of Reelin is required for efficient induction of phosphorylation of Dab1, an essential adaptor protein for canonical Reelin signaling. However, the physiological significance of the Reelin CTR in vivo remains unexplored. To dissect out Reelin functions, we made a knock-in (KI) mouse in which the Reelin CTR is deleted. The amount of Dab1, an indication of canonical Reelin signaling strength, is increased in the KI mouse, indicating that the CTR is necessary for efficient induction of Dab1 phosphorylation in vivo. Formation of layer structures during embryonic development is normal in the KI mouse. Intriguingly, the marginal zone (MZ) of the cerebral cortex becomes narrower at postnatal stages because upper-layer neurons invade the MZ and their apical dendrites are misoriented and poorly branched. Furthermore, Reelin undergoes proteolytic cleavage by proprotein convertases at a site located 6 residues from the C terminus, and it was suggested that this cleavage abrogates the Reelin binding to the neuronal cell membrane. Results from ectopic expression of mutant Reelin proteins in utero suggest that the dendrite development and maintenance of theMZrequire Reelin protein with an intact CTR. These results provide a novel model regarding Reelin functions involving its CTR, which is not required for neuronal migration during embryonic stages but is required for the development and maintenance of the MZ in the postnatal cerebral cortex. ? 2015 the authors.",Dab1; Dendrite; Knock-in mouse; Neuronal migration; Proteolysis; Reelin,"alkaline phosphatase; hybrid protein; reelin; nerve cell adhesion molecule; nerve protein; reelin protein; scleroprotein; serine proteinase; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; brain cortex; brain development; carboxy terminal sequence; cell aggregation; cell density; controlled study; disabled 1 gene; electroporation; embryo; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; gene; gene mutation; genetic transfection; genotype; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; immunoprecipitation; mouse; nerve cell; Nissl staining; nonhuman; phosphorylation; polymerase chain reaction; postnatal development; priority journal; protein degradation; protein expression; signal transduction; Southern blotting; Western blotting; animal; brain cortex; Chlorocebus aethiops; COS 1 cell line; gene targeting; genetics; growth, development and aging; HEK293 cell line; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; procedures; protein degradation; Animals; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Cercopithecus aethiops; Cerebral Cortex; COS Cells; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Gene Knock-In Techniques; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Proteolysis; Serine Endopeptidases",2-s2.0-84925071379

We have recently reported that it directs lysosomal targeting of nascent neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides by directly binding Aβ. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the human sorLA domain responsible for Aβ capture, Vps10p, in an unbound state and in complex with two ligands. Vps10p assumes a ten-bladed β-propeller fold with a large tunnel at the center. An internal ligand derived from the sorLA propeptide bound inside the tunnel to extend the β-sheet of one of the propeller blades. The structure of the sorLA Vps10p-Aβ complex revealed that the same site is used. Peptides are recognized by sorLA Vps10p in redundant modes without strict dependence on a particular amino acid sequence, thus suggesting a broad specificity toward peptides with a propensity for β-sheet formation. ? 2015 Nature America, Inc.",,"amyloid beta protein; membrane protein; sortilin related receptor with low density lipoprotein receptor class a repeat; unclassified drug; amyloid beta protein; carrier protein; low density lipoprotein receptor related protein; SORL1 protein, human; Alzheimer disease; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; Article; beta sheet; controlled study; crystal structure; human; human cell; lysosome; molecular recognition; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pH; priority journal; protein binding; protein conformation; protein domain; protein expression; protein function; protein purification; target cell; binding site; chemical structure; chemistry; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance; physiology; protein tertiary structure; X ray crystallography; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Binding Sites; Crystallography, X-Ray; Humans; LDL-Receptor Related Proteins; Membrane Transport Proteins; Models, Molecular; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Biomolecular; Protein Structure, Tertiary",2-s2.0-84924233662

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the utility of white matter (WM) atrophy for the diagnosis of patients with clinically diagnosed CBD (corticobasal syndrome, CBS) and PSP (Richardson's syndrome, RS). Methods We randomly divided the 3D T1-weighted MR images of 18 CBS patients, 33 RS patients, and 32 age-matched controls into two groups. We obtained segmented WM images in the first group using Voxel-based specific regional analysis system for Alzheimer's disease (VSRAD) based on statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8 plus diffeomorphic anatomical registration through exponentiated Lie algebra. A target volume of interest (VOI) for disease-specific atrophy was subsequently determined in this group using SPM8 group analyses of WM atrophy between patients groups and controls. We then evaluated the utility of these VOIs for diagnosing CBS and RS patients in the second group. Z score values in these VOIs were used as the determinant in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses. Results Specific target VOIs were determined in the bilateral frontal subcortical WM for CBS and in the midbrain tegmentum for RS. In ROC analyses, the target VOIs of CBS and RS compared to those of controls exhibited an area under curve (AUC) of 0.99 and 0.84, respectively, which indicated an adequate diagnostic power. The VOI of CBS revealed a higher AUC than that of RS for differentiating between CBS and RS (AUC, 0.75 vs 0.53). Conclusions Bilateral frontal WM volume reduction demonstrated a higher power for differentiating CBS from RS. This VOI analysis is useful for clinically diagnosing CBS and RS. ? 2014 The Authors.

Statins inhibit the synthesis of vitamin K<inf>2</inf>, the cofactor for matrix Gla-protein activation, which in turn protects arteries from calcification. Statins inhibit the biosynthesis of selenium containing proteins, one of which is glutathione peroxidase serving to suppress peroxidative stress. An impairment of selenoprotein biosynthesis may be a factor in congestive heart failure, reminiscent of the dilated cardiomyopathies seen with selenium deficiency. Thus, the epidemic of heart failure and atherosclerosis that plagues the modern world may paradoxically be aggravated by the pervasive use of statin drugs.

Ellagic acid (EA), a component of pomegranate fruit juice (PFJ), is a plant-derived polyphenol and has antioxidant properties. PFJ and EA have been reported to suppress various cancers, including prostate cancer. However, their chemopreventive effects on development and progression of prostate cancer using in vivo models have not been established yet. METHODS. The transgenic rat for adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model was used to investigate the modulating effects of PFJ and EA on prostate carcinogenesis. Three-week-old male transgenic rats were treated with EA or PFJ for 10 weeks. In vitro assays for cell growth, apoptosis, and Western blot were performed using the human prostate cancer cell lines, LNCaP (androgen-dependent), PC-3 and DU145 (androgen-independent). RESULTS. PFJ decreased the incidence of adenocarcinoma in lateral prostate, and both EA and PFJ suppressed the progression of prostate carcinogenesis and induced apoptosis by caspase 3 activation in the TRAP model. In addition, the level of lipid peroxidation in ventral prostate was significantly decreased by EA treatment. EA was able to inhibit cell proliferation of LNCaP, whereas this effect was not observed in PC-3 and DU145. As with the in vivo data, EA induced apoptosis in LNCaP by increasing Bax/Bcl-2 ratio and caspase 3 activation. Cellcycle related proteins, p21WAF, p27Kip, cdk2, and cyclin E, were increased while cyclin D1 and cdk1 were decreased by EA treatment. CONCLUSIONS. The results indicate that PFJ and EA are potential chemopreventive agents for prostate cancer, and EA may be the active component of PFJ that exerts these anti-cancer effects. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Apoptosis; Chemoprevention; Ellagic acid; Pomegranate; Prostate cancer,"androgen; androgen receptor; caspase 3; cyclin D1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cyclin E; ellagic acid; estradiol; Ki 67 antigen; lipid hydroperoxide; testosterone; androgen; antiandrogen; ellagic acid; plant extract; androgen dependent prostate cancer; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer prevention; carcinogenesis; cell cycle regulation; cell proliferation; controlled study; enzyme activation; estradiol blood level; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; lipid peroxidation; LNCaP cell line; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; pomegranate juice; priority journal; prostate adenocarcinoma; prostate cancer cell line; rat; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; testosterone blood level; transgenic rat; Western blotting; animal; apoptosis; beverage; carcinogenesis; drug effects; fruit; isolation and purification; Lythraceae; metabolism; pathology; physiology; Prostatic Neoplasms; Sprague Dawley rat; tumor cell line; Androgen Antagonists; Androgens; Animals; Apoptosis; Beverages; Carcinogenesis; Cell Line, Tumor; Ellagic Acid; Fruit; Humans; Male; Plant Extracts; Prostatic Neoplasms; Punicaceae; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rats, Transgenic",2-s2.0-84923316600

Hormone-sensitive prostate cancer cells, (LNCaP) and castration resistant cancer cells (PC3 and PCai1) were treated with NCL1, and LSD1 expression and cell viability were assessed. Prostate cancer cells showed strong LSD1 expression, and cell viability was decreased by NCL1. ChIP analysis showed that NCL1 induced H3K9me2 accumulation at the promoters of androgen-responsive genes. NCL1 also induced G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In addition, autophagosomes and autolysosomes were induced by NCL1 treatment in LNCaP. Furthermore, LC3-II expression was significantly increased by NCL1 and chloroquine. In mice injected subcutaneously with PCai1 and intraperitoneally with NCL1, tumor volume was reduced with no adverse effects in NCL1-treated mice. Finally, LSD1 expression in human cancer specimens was significantly higher than that in normal prostate glands. In conclusion, NCL1 effectively suppressed prostate cancer growth without adverse events.

No safe and effective therapeutic method has been developed for the choroidal fibrosis, although anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy can partially shrink the CNV. We recently reported that periostin (POSTN), which is produced by retinal pigment epithelial cells, has an important role in the formation of preretinal FVMs, but its role in choroidal FVMs has not been determined. In this study, we used Postn knockout mice to investigate the role played by POSTN in choroidal FVM formation. In addition, we used a new class of RNA interference (RNAi) agent (NK0144) that targets POSTN and determined its effect on choroidal FVM development. Genetic ablation of Postn had an inhibitory effect not only on CNV formation but also on choroidal fibrosis in a mouse CNV model. NK0144 also had a greater inhibitory effect on both the CNV and choroidal fibrosis than control RNAi with no apparent adverse effects.

Differences in quality of life and psychological distress were also examined. Methods: Ambulatory breast cancer patients who were randomly selected participated in this study. The patients were asked to complete the Short-form Supportive Care Needs Survey, which covers five domains of need (health system and information, psychological, physical, care and support and sexuality needs), the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C 30 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Results: A total of 408 patients were enrolled and distributed into four groups [Group 1 (N = 115)], within 1 year of diagnosis; Group 2 [N = 105], 1-3 years since diagnosis; Group 3 [N = 94], >3 years since diagnosis; and Group 4 [N = 94], recurrence). Significant differences were observed in total, psychological, physical and daily living, and patient care and support needs, as well as in quality of life, whereas there were no significant differences in health system and information, sexuality needs and psychological distress. In general, Groups 1 and 4 had a higher need level and lower quality of life. Conclusions: Patients' perceived needs and quality of life may vary according to time since cancer diagnosis and the presence of cancer recurrence. The findings suggest that different care for supporting breast cancer survivors after diagnosis should be recommended, and that the time since diagnosis and/or the presence of recurrence may be relevant indicators for providing optimal and individualized care. ?

The aims of this study were to depict the clinical realities of IBS in East Asian countries and test the hypothesis that the diagnosis and treatment of IBS differ between countries. Subjects and Methods: Study participants were 251 physicians involved in the clinical practice of IBS at major institutions in Japan, South Korea, China, the Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore. The questionnaire contained 45 questions focused on the clinical practice of IBS. Results: Subjects in Japan, South Korea, China, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore accounted for 55.4, 17.9, 8.8, 8.0, 6.4 and 3.6% of the study cohort, respectively. Amongst East Asian physicians, the most important symptom was considered to be abdominal pain by 33.4%, whilst 24.3% regarded alternating diarrhea and constipation to be the most important symptoms. Total colonoscopy and histopathology use showed no difference among countries. Prescriptions given for mild (p < 0.0001), moderate (p < 0.0001), severe (p < 0.0001), intractable (p = 0.002), diarrheal (p < 0.0001) and constipating (p < 0.0001) patients with IBS significantly differed between the countries. Except for several minor points, IBS specialists showed no significant difference in their diagnosis and treatment of IBS when compared to nonspecialists. Conclusion: This survey provided data on the clinical treatment of IBS among East Asian countries. The results supported the hypothesis that the diagnosis and treatment of IBS differs between countries. ? 2015 S.

By a 1.5-T MRI, we performed single-shot diffusion magnetic resonance imaging to acquire diffusion-weighted images (DWIs) with multiple b values. We determined perfusion-related diffusion and true diffusion coefficients (D* and D), the fraction of the perfusion-related diffusion component (F), and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in the lumbar vertebral body. Then, we compared these diffusion parameters with the bone mineral density (BMD) obtained with dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Moreover, the fat fraction (FF) of the bone marrow was calculated by use of double gradient-echo images with and without spectral adiabatic inversion recovery in the same subject. The BMD showed a significant positive correlation with D*, whereas there was no significant correlation between the other diffusion parameters and BMD. There was a negative correlation between the D or ADC and FF, although no correlation was found between D* or F and FF.

Association with AIP can be utilized in the diagnosis of IgG4-SC. However, some cases of IgG4-SC are isolated from AIP, which complicates the diagnosis. Most of the reported cases of isolated IgG4-SC displayed hilar biliary strictures, whereas isolated IgG4-SC with intrapancreatic biliary stricture is very rare. Recently, we have encountered 5 isolated intrapancreatic IgG4-SC cases that were not associated with AIP, three of which were pathologically investigated after surgical operation. They all were males with a mean age of 74.2 years. The pancreas was not enlarged in any of these cases. No irregular narrowing of the main pancreatic duct was found. Bile duct wall thickening in lesions without luminal stenosis was detected by abdominal computed tomography in all five cases, by endoscopic ultrasonography in two out of four cases and by intraductal ultrasonography in all three cases. In three cases, serum IgG4 levels were within the normal limits. The mean serum IgG4 level measured before surgery was 202.1 mg/dL (4 cases). Isolated intrapancreatic IgG4-SC is difficult to diagnose, especially if the IgG4 level remains normal. Thus, this type of IgG4-SC should be suspected in addition to cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer if stenosis of intrapancreatic bile duct is present. ?

The HBV-specific CD8+ T-cell response is vigorous, polyclonal and multispecific in acutely infected patients who successfully clear the virus and relatively weak and narrowly focused in chronically infected patients. The immunological basis for this dichotomy is unclear. A recent study using HBV transgenic mice and HBV-specific T-cell receptor transgenic mice suggests that intrahepatic antigen presentation by HBV positive hepatocytes suppresses HBV-specific CD8+ T-cell responses through a co-inhibitory molecule, programmed cell death 1 (PD-1). In contrast, antigen presentation by activated professional antigen-presenting cells induces functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. These findings suggest that the outcome of T-cell priming is largely dependent on the nature of antigen-presenting cells. Another study suggests that the timing of HBV-specific CD4+ T-cell priming regulates the magnitude of the HBV-specific CD8+ T-cell response. Other factors that could regulate HBV-specific cellular immune responses are high viral loads, mutational epitope inactivation, T-cell receptor antagonism and infection of immunologically privileged tissues. However, these pathways become apparent only in the setting of an ineffective cellular immune response, which is therefore the fundamental underlying cause. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which HBV evades host immune responses will eventually help develop new immunotherapeutic strategies designed to terminate chronic HBV infection. ? 2014 The Japan Society of Hepatology.",Hepatitis B virus; Immune response; Immunological priming; Immunotherapy; T cells,alpha interferon; CD40 ligand monoclonal antibody; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4; cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 antibody; epitope; gamma interferon; hepatitis B surface antibody; interleukin 15; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; interleukin 21; interleukin 22; interleukin 4; interleukin 7; lentivirus vector; neutralizing antibody; retrovirus vector; rituximab; T lymphocyte receptor; toll like receptor affecting agent; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; adaptive immunity; adoptive transfer; antigen presenting cell; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cellular immunity; cytokine production; dendritic cell; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; immunobiology; immunotherapy; innate immunity; liver cell; memory cell; natural killer cell; natural killer cell mediated cytotoxicity; natural killer T cell; persistent virus infection; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; Review; Th17 cell; transgenic mouse; viral clearance; virus load; virus mutation,2-s2.0-84921447260

Options include anterior lumbar interbody fusion, posterior approach fusion procedures such as posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) and posterolateral lumbar fusion (PLF), anterior and posterior lumbar fusion (APLF), and total disc replacement (TDR). However, the trends during the last decade are uncertain. Purpose To examine the trends in the surgical treatment for lumbar DDD on a national level. Study design A retrospective analysis of population-based national hospital discharge data collected for the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS). Patient sample In the NIS from 2000 to 2009, patients aged 18 years or older with primary diagnosis of lumbar/lumbosacral DDD who underwent surgical treatment were included. Outcome measures Trends in the surgical treatment for lumbar DDD. Methods Clinical data were derived from the NIS between 2000 and 2009. Patients aged 18 years or older with a primary diagnosis of lumbar/lumbosacral DDD who underwent spinal fusion or TDR were identified. Data regarding patient- and health care system-related characteristics were retrieved and analyzed. Results A total of 380,305 patients underwent surgical treatment for lumbar DDD between 2000 and 2009. Population adjusted incidence increased 2.4-fold from 2000 to 2009. Among the procedures, APLF increased 3.0-fold and PLIF/PLF increased 2.8-fold. Total disc replacement did not increase significantly. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion was performed in 16.8% of patients, PLIF/PLF in 67.9%, APLF in 13.6%, and TDR in 1.8%. Surgical treatment for lumbar DDD was 1.8 times more common in the Midwest region and 1.7 times more common in the South region than in the Northeast region. Total disc replacement was more common in younger patients and in the Northeast region. Poterior lumbar interbody fusion/PLF was more common in older patients and in the South region. Conclusions During the last decade, surgical treatment for lumbar DDD has increased 2.4-fold in the United States. Although all fusion procedures significantly increased, TDR did not increase. Surgical treatment for lumbar DDD was more common in the Midwest and South regions. Trends in the procedures were different depending on the age group and hospital region. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In this study, we designed biomaterials based on the components and morphology of blood vessel scaffolds, and examined their ability to guide the migration of neuroblasts into a brain lesion site in mice. Transplanted porous sponge containing components of the basement membrane (BM) matrix enhanced neuroblast migration into the lesion, and detailed morphological examination suggested that the infiltrating cells used the BM sponge as a migration scaffold. Laminin (LN)-rich porous sponge also enhanced the migration of neuroblasts into the lesion, whereas BM gel and gelatin porous sponge did not.

Immunosuppression makes patients more susceptible to infection, resulting in an increased risk of infectious complications, including the development of severe septicemia that may be life-threatening. It is necessary for dental staff to be familiar with an appropriate protocol in such cases and to share information about the chemotherapy with a hematologist. To verify the effectiveness of our dental intervention protocol, we conducted a prospective study on the incidence of complications for each myelosuppressive grade of chemotherapy in patients with hematopoietic malignancy. We compared the incidence of complications between treatment P (patients who finished all the dental treatments according to the protocol) and treatment Q (patients who did not) per grade (A, B, C, D) and incidence of systemic or oral findings. We also compared the incidence of oral complication related to the residual teeth between first chemo (patients who were undergoing chemotherapy for the first time) and prior chemo (not the first time). There were significant differences in inflammatory complications between treatment P and treatment Q. We found that both systemic and oral inflammatory complications increased with higher-grade myelosuppressive chemotherapy. Additionally, there was a significant difference between the incidence of oral complications related to the residual teeth between first chemo and prior chemo. Complete implementation of the dental intervention protocol was associated with fewer oral and systemic infectious and inflammatory complications in patients with hematopoietic malignancies undergoing chemotherapy. The incidence of oral and systemic complications also increased with grade of chemotherapy. These results support the validity of our dental intervention protocol. We should pay close attention to the oral state of de novo hematopoietic malignancy patients. ?

The sensing mechanism of hepatitis B virus (HBV), a DNA virus, and the subsequent downstream signaling events remain to be fully clarified. Here we found that type III but nottype I interferons are predominantly induced in human primary hepatocytes in response to HBV infection, through retinoic acid-inducible gene-I (RIG-I)-mediated sensing of the 5'-ε region of HBV pregenomic RNA. In addition, RIG-I could also counteract the interaction of HBV polymerase (P protein) with the 5'-ε region in an RNA-binding dependent manner, which consistently suppressed viral replication.

However, activation of the extensive crosstalk among the HER receptors as well as other RTKs, particularly HER-MET crosstalk, has emerged as a likely source of drug resistance. In this study, we developed two new types of tetra-specific antibodies that recognize EGFR, HER2, HER3, and VEGF. These tetra-specific antibodies, termed FL518 (four-in-one antibody) and CRTB6 (tetra-specific, tetravalent antibody), not only inhibited signaling mediated by these receptors in vitro and in vivo but unexpectedly also disrupted HER-MET crosstalk. When compared with two-in-one antibodies and a series of bispecific antibodies in multiple tumor models, FL518 and CRTB6 were more broadly efficacious. We further showed that tetra-specific antibodies were far more effective than bispecific antibodies in inhibiting the growth of anti-HER-resistant cancer cells, which exhibited elevated levels of MET activation both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our results establish a new principle to achieve combined HER inhibition and limit drug resistance using a single antibody. ?2014 AACR.",,"antineoplastic agent; bevacizumab; bh 1 44; cetuximab; crt B6; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epidermal growth factor receptor 3; fl 518; mehd 7954 a; receptor antibody; scatter factor receptor; trastuzumab; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; bevacizumab; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epidermal growth factor receptor 3; ERBB2 protein, human; ERBB3 protein, human; immunoglobulin G; MET protein, human; monoclonal antibody; scatter factor receptor; trastuzumab; vasculotropin A; VEGFA protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; antibody combining site; antibody detection; antibody specificity; antigen binding; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; drug effect; drug protein binding; female; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein synthesis inhibition; receptor upregulation; signal transduction; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Bagg albino mouse; cell growth; drug effects; immunology; metabolism; Neoplasms; nude mouse; randomization; SCID mouse; tumor cell line; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Cell Growth Processes; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Mice, SCID; Neoplasms; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-met; Random Allocation; Receptor Cross-Talk; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptor, ErbB-3; Signal Transduction; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",2-s2.0-84920657077

NOMID pathophysiology is explained by the NLRP3 inflammasome, which produces interleukin-1β (IL-1β). However, epiphyseal overgrowth in NOMID is resistant to anti-IL-1 therapy and may therefore occur independently of the NLRP3 inflammasome. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of mutated NLRP3 on chondrocytes using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from patients with NOMID.Methods We established isogenic iPSCs with wild-type or mutant NLRP3 from 2 NOMID patients with NLRP3 somatic mosaicism. The iPSCs were differentiated into chondrocytes in vitro and in vivo. The phenotypes of chondrocytes with wild-type and mutant NLRP3 were compared, particularly the size of the chondrocyte tissue produced.Results Mutant iPSCs produced larger chondrocyte masses than wild-type iPSCs owing to glycosaminoglycan overproduction, which correlated with increased expression of the chondrocyte master regulator SOX9. In addition, in vivo transplantation of mutant cartilaginous pellets into immunodeficient mice caused disorganized endochondral ossification. Enhanced chondrogenesis was independent of caspase 1 and IL-1, and thus the NLRP3 inflammasome. Investigation of the human SOX9 promoter in chondroprogenitor cells revealed that the CREB/ATF-binding site was critical for SOX9 overexpression caused by mutated NLRP3. This was supported by increased levels of cAMP and phosphorylated CREB in mutant chondroprogenitor cells.Conclusion Our findings indicate that the intrinsic hyperplastic capacity of NOMID chondrocytes is dependent on the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway, independent of the NLRP3 inflammasome. ? 2015 The Authors.

As oncolytic reovirus is currently undergoing clinical trials internationally, we wanted to explore whether combination therapy using trastuzumab and reovirus might provide a novel, more effective therapeutic option for gastric cancer. Cell proliferation and cell apoptosis were examined in vitro, while molecular analysis of pathways responsible for cell damage was examined using polymerase chain reaction array. Activation of the proteins related to apoptosis, cell growth and survival was detected by Western blotting. Mouse tumor xenograft models were used to examine antitumor activity in vivo. Reovirus sensitized HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. Both in vitro and in vivo studies provided evidence that the combination therapy is a more powerful modality against HER2-overexpressing gastric cancer cells than treatment using a single agent. Molecular analysis indicated that combination therapy induced significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in cancer cells. Antibody against TRAIL strongly inhibited cell toxicity caused by the combined treatment. These data suggest that reovirus may augment trastuzumab-induced cytotoxicity in gastric cancer cells. ? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Gastric cancer cell; Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2); Reovirus; Trastuzumab; Tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL),"epidermal growth factor receptor 2; oncolytic virus; trastuzumab; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; messenger RNA; monoclonal antibody; TNFSF10 protein, human; trastuzumab; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer combination chemotherapy; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug potentiation; human; human cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; protein phosphorylation; Reoviridae; signal transduction; stomach cancer; tumor xenograft; Western blotting; animal; Bagg albino mouse; drug effects; drug screening; enzyme immunoassay; genetics; metabolism; multimodality cancer therapy; nude mouse; oncolytic virotherapy; pathology; real time polymerase chain reaction; Reoviridae; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Stomach Neoplasms; tumor cell culture; Orthoreovirus; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Cell Proliferation; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Nude; Oncolytic Virotherapy; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptor, ErbB-2; Reoviridae; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Stomach Neoplasms; TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84919458952

The present study hypothesized that an increase in BRAF copy number may be correlated with certain clinicopathological features of lung adenocarcinoma in Japanese patients. The BRAF gene copy number was analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction amplifications in 29 surgically treated lung adenocarcinoma cases without EGFR or Kras mutations from Nagoya City University Hospital (Nagoya, Japan). Seven BRAF-mutant cases were included. Increased BRAF gene copy number was identified in three lung adenocarcinoma patients (10.3%), all of which exhibited the V600E mutation. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization with BRAF-specific and chromosome 7 centromeric probes, increased copy number status was associated with gene amplification or gain of chromosome 7. Although increased BRAF copy number was correlated with BRAF V600E mutations, numerical changes in BRAF copy number were rare and mild in lung adenocarcinoma, resulting in no significant difference in pathological tumor status or tumor stage. ? 2015, Spandidos Publications.

In the diagnostic biomarkers of AD, the blood sample represents a more non-invasive, inexpensive and acceptable sources for repeated measurements than the cerebrospinal fluid. In this study, the fingerprinting metabolomics was proposed for the challenge of the blood-based diagnosis of defined AD by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (HILIC/MS). These plasma samples were selected from postmortem specimens based on these pathological examinations. Firstly, we compared these HILIC columns for the non-targeted metabolic assay using pooled plasma. The principal component analysis plot of these seven columns was performed using the repeatability of these chromatograms, and can be used to visualize trends in data sets by three-dimensional dispersion, contributory standard deviation and the number of detections. Based on these results, TSK-Amide 80 and TSKgel-NH2 columns are used as a reliable HILIC/MS assay of blood-based AD metabolomics that showed metabolic profiling of the AD pathology in MS chromatograms that ranged from 1182 to 2284 compounds. A total of 54 peaks were evaluated in order to identify useful ion signal candidates using an orthogonal partial least-squares-discriminant analysis. These peaks were then specifically analyzed using the HILIC-tandem MS assay by a receiver operating characteristic curve and linear discriminant analysis for the diagnosis of the defined AD. The fingerprinting metabolomics can overcome the limitations of previous challenging blood-based diagnosis of AD, and directly evaluates the specific comparative statistical values from the raw data. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Alzheimer's disease; Blood; HILIC/MS; Metabolomics,"Alzheimer's disease; HILIC/MS; Hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatographies; Metabolomics; Multivariate statistical analysis; Blood; biological marker; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; blood sampling; brain tissue; comparative study; controlled study; electrospray mass spectrometry; female; human; human tissue; hydrophilic interaction chromatography; male; mass spectrometry; metabolic activity assay; metabolomics; middle aged; sensitivity and specificity; very elderly; Alzheimer disease; blood; blood analysis; devices; evaluation study; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; multivariate analysis; procedures; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Blood Chemical Analysis; Chromatography, Liquid; Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolomics; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis",2-s2.0-84910090879

Given that SDC is biologically similar to breast and prostate cancer, anti-androgenic receptor (AR) and anti-human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) therapies have the potential to exert effects, not only on patients with breast and prostate cancer but also on those with SDC. Methods: The expression levels of HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Ki-67, and AR were assessed in 32 patients with SDC, and their correlations with overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were analyzed retrospectively. SDC was classified into five subtypes using a method similar to that used for breast cancer. Results: Anti-AR, HER2, and EGFR were positive in 23 (71.9?%), 14 (43.8?%), and 26 (81.3?%) cases, respectively. One or more of these 3 factors were positive in 30 (93.8?%) cases. The Ki-67 labeling index was greater than 15?% in all cases. While molecular status did not correlate with OS, EGFR and AR positivity were significantly associated with DFS in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis revealed that EGFR was the only independent predictor of DFS. Conclusions: The statuses of some molecules are useful to predict DFS in patients with SDC. Ki-67 overexpression suggests that cytotoxic agents are effective for SDC. Since the majority of SDCs express AR, HER2, and/or EGFR, assessing and targeting these molecules are promising strategies to improve the prognosis of unresectable, metastatic or recurrent SDC, and a classification system according to the molecular expression status may be useful to select appropriate therapy. ? 2014, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Androgen receptor; EGFR; HER2; Ki-67; Salivary duct carcinoma,"androgen receptor; AR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; Ki 67 antigen; adult; aged; disease free survival; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; prognosis; retrospective study; salivary gland duct; salivary gland tumor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Ki-67 Antigen; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Androgen; Retrospective Studies; Salivary Ducts; Salivary Gland Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84893826528

Recent analyses have shown that the former can be divided into two subtypes, luminal A and luminal B. These differ in response to endocrine therapy and chemotherapy, and in prognosis. In a previous study, we found that microRNA (miR)-1290 that was significantly down-regulated in luminal A tumors and its potential target arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1). The aim of the present study was to determine whether NAT1 is a bona fide target of miR-1290, and to investigate the impact of NAT1 on breast cancer prognosis. Methods: Luciferase reporter assays were employed to validate NAT1 as a putative miR-1290 target gene. Expression of NAT1, ERa, progesterone receptor (PgR) and HER2 was analyzed in 394 breast cancer samples by immunohistochemistry. Results: NAT1 was confirmed to be a direct target of miR-1290. Levels of expression of NAT1 were positively correlated with those of ERa (P < 0.0001) and PgR (P < 0.0001), but negatively correlated with both tumor grade and size (P < 0.0001). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the presence of NAT1 was significantly associated with increased overall survival (OS) (P = 0.0416) in these patients. Similarly, significant associations of NAT1 with disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.0048) and OS (P = 0.0055) in those patients who received adjuvant endocrine therapy with tamoxifen (n = 176) were found. Moreover, NAT1 was also significantly associated with increased DFS (P = 0.0025) and OS (P = 0.0007) in the subset of lymph node-positive patients (n = 147). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed significant associations between levels of NAT1 and DFS (P = 0.0005 and 0.019, respectively). Conclusions: We report that miR-1290 directly targets the NAT1 3'-UTR and that NAT1 protein expression is correlated with improved OS of breast cancer patients. NAT1 is a possible prognostic biomarker for lymph node-positive breast cancer. Thus, miR-1290 and its target NAT1 are associated with important characteristics of breast cancer. ? 2014 Endo et al.",Arylamine N-acetyltransferase 1 (NAT1); Breast cancer; MiR-1290,arylamine acetyltransferase; arylamine N acetyltransferase 1; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor alpha; microRNA; microRNA 1290; progesterone receptor; tamoxifen; unclassified drug; 3' untranslated region; adjuvant therapy; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer grading; cancer prognosis; controlled study; disease free survival; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lumpectomy; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; mastectomy; overall survival; protein expression; tumor volume,2-s2.0-84928724930

Even for expert surgeons, esophagojejunostomy after laparoscopy-assisted total gastrectomy (LATG) can be technically challenging. We perform the overlap method of esophagojejunostomy after LATG for gastric cancer. However, technical questions remain. Is the overlap method safer and more useful than other anastomosis techniques, such as methods using a circular stapler? In addition, while we perform this overlap reconstruction after LATG in a deep and narrow operative field, can the overlap method be performed safely regardless of body habitus? This study aimed to evaluate these issues retrospectively and to review the literature. Methods: From October 2005 to August 2013, we performed LATG with lymph-node dissection and Roux-en-Y reconstruction using the overlap method in 77 patients with gastric cancer. This study examined pre-, intra- and postoperative data. Results: Mean operation time, time to perform anastomosis, and estimated blood loss were 391.4 min, 36.3 min, and 146.9 ml, respectively. There were no deaths, and morbidity rate was 13%, including one patient (1%) who developed anastomotic stenosis. Mean postoperative hospitalization was 13.4 days. Surgical outcomes did not differ significantly by body mass index. Conclusions: First, the overlap method for esophagojejunostomy after LATG is safe and useful. Second, this method can be performed irrespective of the body type of the patient. In particular, in a deep and narrow operative field, the overlap method is more versatile than other anastomosis methods. We believe that the overlap method can become a standard reconstruction technique for esophagojejunostomy after LATG. ?

For such patients, specific kinase inhibitors have emerged as effective clinical treatments. However, the currently known oncogenic alterations do not account for all never smokers who develop NSCLC. We sought to identify additional oncogenic alterations from patients with NSCLC to define additional treatment options.Experimental Design: We analyzed 576 lung adenocarcinomas from patients of Asian and Caucasian ethnicity. We identified a subset of cancers that did not harbor any known oncogenic alteration. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay on 24 patients from this set with >75% tumor cell content.Results: EGFR mutations were the most common oncogenic alteration from both Asian (53%) and Caucasian (41.6%) patients. No known oncogenic alterations were present in 25.7% of Asian and 31% of Caucasian tumor specimens. We identified a FGFR3-TACC3 fusion event in one of 24 patients from this subset using targeted NGS. Two additional patients harboring FGFR3-TACC3 were identified by screening our entire cohort (overall prevalence, 0.5%). Expression of FGFR3-TACC3 led to IL3 independent growth in Ba/F3 cells. These cells were sensitive to pan-fibroblast growth factor receptor (pan-FGFR) inhibitors but not the epidermal growth factor (EGFR) inhibitor gefitinib.Conclusions: FGFR3-TACC3 rearrangements occur in a subset of patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

Herein, we identified that 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDPK1), a serine threonine kinase, is expressed and active in all eleven multiple myeloma-derived cell lines examined regardless of the type of cytogenetic abnormality, the mutation state of RAS and FGFR3 genes, or the activation state of ERK and AKT. Our results revealed that PDPK1 is a pivotal regulator of molecules that are essential for myelomagenesis, such as RSK2, AKT, c-MYC, IRF4, or cyclin Ds, and that PDPK1 inhibition caused the growth inhibition and the induction of apoptosis with the activation of BIM and BAD, and augmented the in vitro cytotoxic effects of antimyeloma agents in myeloma cells. In the clinical setting, PDPK1 was active in myeloma cells of approximately 90% of symptomatic patients at diagnosis, and the smaller population of patients with multiple myeloma exhibiting myeloma cells without active PDPK1 showed a significantly less frequent proportion of the disease stage III by the International Staging System and a significantly more favorable prognosis, including the longer overall survival period and the longer progression-free survival period by bortezomib treatment, than patients with active PDPK1, suggesting that PDPK1 activation accelerates the disease progression and the resistance to treatment in multiple myeloma.

A systematic review concluded that coagulation factor XII (FXII) deficiency was associated with RPL. However, it could not be established whether the 46 C/T SNP of FXII or low activity of FXII was a risk factor for RPL, because of the small sample size.Methods and Findings: We conducted a cross-sectional and cohort study in 279 patients with two or more unexplained consecutive pregnancy losses and 100 fertile women. The association between the lupus anticoagulant (LA) activity and FXII activity was examined. The frequency of the CC, CTand TT genotypes and the FXII activity were also compared between the patients and controls. Subsequent miscarriage rates among the CC, CT, TT genotypes and according to the FXII activity was examined. LA was associated with reduced FXII activity. The CT, but not the TT, genotype was confirmed to be a risk factor for RPL in the cross-sectional study using multivariate logistic regression analysis (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.37-5.85). The plasma FXII activity in the patients was similar to that in the controls. Neither low FXII activity nor the CT genotype predicted the subsequent pregnancy outcome in the cohort study. On the other hand, and intermediate FXII activity level of 85-101% was predictive of subsequent miscarriage.Conclusions: Low FXII activity was not associated with RPL. The FXII gene was found to be one of the significant susceptibility genes for RPL, similar to the FV Leiden mutation. However, the clinical influence of the CT genotype might be relatively small, because the presence/absence of this genotype did not have any predictive value for the subsequent pregnancy outcome. This was the first study indicating the influence of FXII 46C/T on further pregnancy outcomes. ?2014 Asano et al.",,"blood clotting factor 12; lupus anticoagulant; blood clotting factor 12; adult; ANXA5 gene; Article; blood clotting; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disease association; female; FXII gene; gene; gene frequency; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genotype; heterozygote; homozygote; human; karyotype; major clinical study; medical history; miscarriage rate; parameters concerning the fetus, newborn and pregnancy; partial thromboplastin time; predictive value; pregnancy outcome; recurrent disease; recurrent pregnancy loss; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; spontaneous abortion; wild type; genetics; genotyping technique; metabolism; pathophysiology; pregnancy; recurrent abortion; young adult; Abortion, Habitual; Adult; Cohort Studies; Factor XII; Female; Genotyping Techniques; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84916620536

It can develop not only in patients seropositive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), but also in those with resolved HBV infection who are seronegative for HBsAg but seropositive for antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and/or antibodies against HBsAg (anti-HBs). The risk of HBV reactivation depends on the balance between replication of the virus and the immune response of the host. Anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-rituximab in combination with steroid-containing chemotherapy (R-CHOP: rituximab + cyclophosphamide + hydroxydaunorubicin + vincristine + prednisone/prednisolone)-is an important risk factor for HBV reactivation in HBsAg-negative patients. More obviously, HBsAg-positive patients are considered to be at very high risk for HBV reactivation and, in the rituximab era, 59%-80% of these patients develop HBV reactivation after R-CHOP-like chemotherapy. Patients with resolved HBV infection should also be considered at high risk of HBV reactivation, the incidence of which is reported to be 9%-24% in such lymphoma patients. All patients should be screened to identify risk groups for HBV reactivation before initiating anti-B-cell therapy by measuring serum HBV markers including HBsAg, anti-HBc and anti-HBs. To prevent the development of hepatitis due to HBV reactivation after anti-B-cell therapy, antiviral prophylaxis is recommended for HBsAg-positive patients and/or patients in whom HBV DNA is detectable at baseline, whereas regular monitoring of HBV DNA-guided preemptive antiviral therapy is a reasonable and useful approach for patients with resolved HBV infection.",,B lymphocyte; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; immunology; mass screening; pathophysiology; physiology; treatment outcome; virology; virus activation; B-Lymphocytes; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Mass Screening; Treatment Outcome; Virus Activation,2-s2.0-84925956565

This ability suggests the promising role of NCCs as a source for cell-based therapy. Although several methods have been used to induce human NCCs (hNCCs) from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs) and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), further modifications are required to improve the robustness, efficacy, and simplicity of these methods. Chemically defined medium (CDM) was used as the basal medium in the induction and maintenance steps. By optimizing the culture conditions, the combination of the GSK3β inhibitor and TGFβ inhibitor with a minimum growth factor (insulin) very efficiently induced hNCCs (70-80%) from hPSCs. The induced hNCCs expressed cranial NCC-related genes and stably proliferated in CDM supplemented with EGF and FGF2 up to at least 10 passages without changes being observed in the major gene expression profiles. Differentiation properties were confirmed for peripheral neurons, glia, melanocytes, and corneal endothelial cells. In addition, cells with differentiation characteristics similar to multipotent mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) were induced from hNCCs using CDM specific for human MSCs. Our simple and robust induction protocol using small molecule compounds with defined media enabled the generation of hNCCs as an intermediate material producing terminally differentiated cells for cell-based innovative medicine. ? 2014 Fukuta et al.",,"complementary DNA; glycogen synthase kinase 3 inhibitor; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta inhibitor; growth factor; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta inhibitor; unclassified drug; bone morphogenetic protein; complementary DNA; culture medium; insulin; transforming growth factor beta; Article; cell differentiation; cell lineage; cell migration; cell population; cell therapy; cell type; controlled study; cornea endothelium; culture medium; DNA microarray; embryonic stem cell; fluorescence activated cell sorting; gene expression profiling; glia; human; human cell; immunocytochemistry; immunohistochemistry; melanocyte; mesenchymal stroma cell; nerve cell; neural crest cell; pluripotent stem cell; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; bone development; cartilage cell; cell culture; cell proliferation; chemistry; cornea; cytology; endothelium cell; fibroblast; flow cytometry; mesenchymal stroma cell; metabolism; neural crest; pluripotent stem cell; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Cell Differentiation; Cell Lineage; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Chondrocytes; Cornea; Culture Media; DNA, Complementary; Embryonic Stem Cells; Endothelial Cells; Fibroblasts; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Insulin; Melanocytes; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Neural Crest; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Osteogenesis; Pluripotent Stem Cells; Transforming Growth Factor beta",2-s2.0-84914674829

The 5-year survival for patients with positive and negative PLC results were 44.5% and 72.8%, respectively, and this difference in survival was statistically significant (P <.001). Multivariate analysis showed that positive PLC status was an independent factor for a poor prognosis (hazard ratio, 1.57; P <.001). Significant differences in survival were also found between patients with positive and negative PLC results in the same T categories and stages, including T2a, T3, stage IB, and stage IIIA. The IPLCC recommendations adjusted the prognostic differences in all T categories and stages. The significant difference in survival disappeared between the 2 groups in all T categories and stages.Conclusions Our results indicate that a T category upgrade is prognostically adequate for patients who are PLC-positive.? 2014 The American Association for Thoracic Surgery Methods The Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry database included 11,073 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent resections in 2004.

Co-primary endpoints (Week 12) were ?75% improvement in psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI 75) from baseline and a score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) on a 5-point Investigator's Global Assessment scale (IGA mod 2011 0/1) versus placebo. PASI 75 and IGA mod 2011 0/1 responses at Week 12 were superior with secukinumab 300 mg (82.8% and 55.2%, respectively) or 150 mg (86.2% and 55.2%, respectively) versus placebo (6.9% and 3.4%, respectively; P < 0.0001 for all). Greater than 90% improvement in PASI (PASI 90) was also superior with secukinumab 300 mg (62.1%) or 150 mg (55.2%) versus placebo (0.0%) at Week 12 (P < 0.0001 for both). Clinical responses were sustained up to Week 52 in the majority of patients. During a 12-week induction period, adverse event incidences were 48.3% with secukinumab 300 mg, 55.2% with 150 mg, and 41.4% with placebo. Secukinumab showed robust and sustainable efficacy in symptom reduction for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in the Japanese patients. ? 2014 Japanese Dermatological Association.",IL-17A; Japan; Psoriasis; Randomized controlled trial; Secukinumab,"corticosteroid; cyclosporin; fumaric acid; methotrexate; placebo; secukinumab; interleukin 17; monoclonal antibody; secukinumab; 5-point Investigator's Global Assessment scale; adult; alopecia; aorta thrombosis; Article; controlled study; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug dose comparison; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; eczema; female; furunculosis; heart failure; herpes simplex; human; Japanese (people); lung edema; major clinical study; male; middle aged; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; pharyngitis; phase 3 clinical trial; pneumonia; pruritus; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; psoriasis vulgaris; randomized controlled trial; rhinopharyngitis; tinea pedis; treatment duration; treatment response; urticaria; young adult; antagonists and inhibitors; clinical trial; psoriasis; severity of illness index; treatment outcome; Adult; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Female; Humans; Interleukin-17; Male; Middle Aged; Psoriasis; Severity of Illness Index; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84915805860

Here, we show that the Josephin domain of ataxin 3 catalyzes endo-type cleavage of Lys48-linked polyubiquitin. Furthermore, NMR data obtained following site-specific paramagnetic spin labeling of Lys48-linked di-ubiquitin revealed that both ubiquitin units interact with the Josephin domain, with the C-terminal Gly76 of the proximal unit being situated in the vicinity of the catalytic triad of Josephin domain. Our results help to elucidate how the substrate is recognized by the Josephin domain and properly positioned for an endo-type deubiquitination reaction. ? 2014 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

The purpose of this study was to identify the effects of concomitant use of MTX and baseline characteristics for remission in the treatment of RA with tocilizumab (TCZ) in daily clinical practice.Methods. A total of 240 RA patients who received TCZ were selected from the multicentre Tsurumai Biologics Communication Registry. Predictive baseline factors for remission [28-item DAS (DAS28) < 2.6] at 52 weeks were determined by logistic regression analysis. To confirm whether the associations varied by the level of baseline disease activity, we also assessed the model including the interaction term (each baseline variable × DAS28).Results. In total, 49.3% of the study participants used MTX with TCZ. Even after controlling for the baseline DAS28, shorter disease duration (?3 year) [odds ratio (OR) 3.58 (95% CI 1.81, 7.07)], less structural damage [Steinbroker stage ?II, OR 2.33 (95% CI 1.32, 4.12)] and concomitant prednisolone use [OR 0.38 (95% CI 0.21, 0.68)] showed significant predictive values for remission. Concomitant MTX use failed to show a significant association with remission, whereas a significant interaction was observed among concomitant MTX use × DAS28 (P = 0.006). In patients with high baseline disease activity (DAS28 > 5.1), concomitant MTX use was associated with increased odds for remission [adjusted OR for all baseline variables 2.54 (95% CI 1.11, 5.83)], while no association was indicated between them in patients with low to moderate baseline disease activity (DAS28 ? 5.1).Conclusion. Concomitant MTX use is an important component of TCZ treatment for RA patients with high disease activity. ? The Author 2014.

No worldwide, multiple-device reference values are available. We aimed to establish reference values for a worldwide general population standardizing between the different available methods of measurement. How these values were significantly altered by cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) was then investigated. Methods and results: Existing data from population surveys and clinical trials were combined, whether published or not. Reference values of cSBP and amplification were calculatedas percentiles for 'Normal' (no CVRFs) and 'Reference' (any CVRFs) populations. We included 45 436 subjects out of 82 930 that were gathered from 77 studies of 53 centres. Included subjects were apparently healthy, not treated for hypertension or dyslipidaemia, and free from overt CV disease and diabetes. Values of cSBP and amplification were stratified by brachial blood pressure categories and age decade in turn, both being stratifiedbysex. Amplification decreased with age and more so in males than in females. Sex was the most powerful factor associated with amplification with 6.6 mmHg (5.8-7.4) higher amplification in males than in females. Amplification was marginally but significantly influenced by CVRFs, with smoking and dyslipidaemia decreasing amplification, but increased with increasing levels of blood glucose. Conclusion: Typical values of cSBP and amplification in a healthy population and a population free of traditional CVRFs are now available according to age, sex, and brachial BP, providing values included from different devices with a wide geographical representation. Amplification is significantly influenced by CVRFs, but differently in men and women. ? 2014 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.",Adult; Aged; Aorta; Arteries; Arteriosclerosis; Blood pressure; Central pressure; Humans; Pulse,glucose; adult; aged; Article; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular risk; dyslipidemia; female; glucose blood level; human; male; normal human; population research; reference value; sex difference; smoking; sphygmomanometer; systolic blood pressure; tonometer; age distribution; blood pressure; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial; middle aged; multicenter study; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; reference value; risk factor; sex ratio; systole; young adult; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Cardiovascular Diseases; Female; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reference Values; Risk Factors; Sex Distribution; Systole; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84913589999

However, there are few reports on their effect on the Asian population. Methods: We enrolled 104 Japanese genotype 1 CHC individuals treated with PEG-IFN/RBV and 45 with PEG-IFN/RBV/telaprevir, and evaluated the impact of pretreatment serum IP-10 concentrations on their virological responses. Results: The pretreatment serum IP-10 concentrations were not correlated with IL28B genotype. The receiver-operator curve analysis determined the cut-off value of IP-10 for predicting a sustained virological response (SVR) as 300 pg/mL. In multivariate analysis, the IL28B favorable genotype and IP-10 concentration of less than 300 pg/mL were independent factors for predicting SVR. In a subgroup of patients with the IL28B favorable genotype, the SVR rate was higher in the patients with IP-10 of less than 300 than in those with 300 pg/mL or more, whereas no patient with the IL28B unfavorable genotype and IP-10 of 300 pg/mL or more achieved SVR. Among the patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV/telaprevir, low pretreatment concentrations of serum IP-10 were associated with a very rapid virological response, defined as undetectable HCV RNA at week 2 after the start of therapy. Conclusion: Pretreatment serum IP-10 concentrations are associated with treatment efficacy in PEG-IFN/RBV and with early viral kinetics of hepatitis C virus in PEG-IFN/RBV/telaprevir therapy. ? 2013 The Japan Society of Hepatology.",Hepatitis C; IL28B; Interferon; Interferon-γ-inducible protein-10; Ribavirin; Telaprevir,gamma interferon inducible protein 10; interleukin 28B; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; ribavirin; telaprevir; virus RNA; adult; aged; Article; Asian; drug dose reduction; female; genotype; hepatitis C; human; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; middle aged; protein blood level; treatment outcome; treatment response; virology,2-s2.0-84914146505

The VFs measured by Goldmann perimetry and wide-field FAF images were compared for each eye. The relationship between the areas of hypoautofluorescence on the wide-field FAF images and scotoma on Goldmann perimetry were evaluated. The VF and FAF images in the central 60 degrees were trimmed and superimposed to calculate the percentage agreement between the hypoautofluorescence and the scotomas and between the isoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescence and the remaining VFs.Results: The areas of hypoautofluorescence on the FAF images were correlated significantly (R = 0.86, P<.001) with the areas of the VF defects on Goldmann perimetry. The mean percentage agreement between the hypoautofluorescence and the scotomas was 91.0% ± 7.7% and that of the isoautofluorescence and hyperautofluorescence with the remaining VFs was 84.5% ± 7.4%. The areas of geographic hypoautofluorescence with or without hyperautofluorescent bands reflected the VF defects, while nummular or mottled hypoautofluorescence without VF defects was seen in 7 eyes.Conclusion: These results suggested that wide-field FAF imaging is useful to evaluate the remaining retinal function in patients with RP.Abnormal fundus autofluorescence precedes loss of retinal function and is helpful for monitoring disease progression. ? 2014 by Elsevier Inc.

From weeks 24 to 48, patients were monitored every 4 weeks; the former group received intravitreal aflibercept as needed (PRN), and the sham group received sham. From weeks 52 to 76, patients were monitored every 8 weeks, and both groups received intravitreal aflibercept PRN. The primary endpoint (proportion of patients who gained ?15 letters) was at week 24. This study reports exploratory outcomes at week 76.Results: The proportion of patients who gained ?15 letters in the intravitreal aflibercept and sham groups was 60.2%vs 22.1%at week 24 (patients discontinued before week 24 were considered nonresponders; P < .0001), 60.2% vs 32.4% at week 52 (last observation carried forward, P <.001), and 57.3% vs 29.4% at week 76 (last observation carried forward; P < .001).

The presence of residual undifferentiated hPSCs in CTPs is a quality concern associated with tumorigencity. However, no simple in vitro method for direct detection of undifferentiated hPSCs that contaminate CTPs has been developed. Here, we show a novel approach for direct and sensitive detection of a trace amount of undifferentiated human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) using a highly efficient amplification method in combination with laminin-521 and Essential 8 medium. Essential 8 medium better facilitated the growth of hiPSCs dissociated into single cells on laminin-521 than in mTeSR1 medium. hiPSCs cultured on laminin-521 in Essential 8 medium were maintained in an undifferentiated state and they maintained the ability to differentiate into various cell types. Essential 8 medium allowed robust hiPSC proliferation plated on laminin-521 at low cell density, whereas mTeSR1 did not enhance the cell growth. The highly efficient culture system using laminin-521 and Essential 8 medium detected hiPSCs spiked into primary human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or human neurons at the ratio of 0.001%-0.01% as formed colonies. Moreover, this assay method was demonstrated to detect residual undifferentiated hiPSCs in cell preparations during the process of hMSC differentiation from hiPSCs. These results indicate that our highly efficient amplification system using a combination of laminin-521 and Essential 8 medium is able to detect a trace amount of undifferentiated hPSCs contained as impurities in CTPs and would contribute to quality assessment of hPSC-derived CTPs during the manufacturing process. ? 2014 Tano et al.",,animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell assay; cell culture; cell density; cell differentiation; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell type; controlled study; culture medium; culture technique; embryo; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vitro study; male; mesenchymal stem cell; mouse; nerve cell; nonhuman; pluripotent stem cell; residue analysis; stem cell expansion; stem cell transplantation; animal; biological therapy; cell line; chemistry; cytology; in vitro study; pluripotent stem cell; culture medium; laminin; Animals; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Culture Media; Humans; In Vitro Techniques; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Laminin; Mice; Pluripotent Stem Cells,2-s2.0-84908584397

The recent improvement in survival may be due to improvements in second-line treatment and supportive care.Background: The aim of our study was to analyze changes over time in the characteristics, treatment, and outcome of patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL).Methods: Data on 315 patients with histologically proven PCNSL undergoing radiotherapy between 2005 and 2009 were collected from 20 Japanese institutions using a questionnaire. These data were then compared with data on 273 patients treated during the period 1995–2004 and those on 466 patients treated during the period 1985–1994.Results: In terms of patient and tumor characteristics, we found a significant increase in mean patient age in the 2005–2009 period compared to the 1985–2004 period (63 vs. 58–59?years, respectively) and in the percentage of patients with better performance status (PS) during the 2005–2009 period compared with the 1995–2004 period (World Health Organization PS 0–2: 73 vs. 65?%, respectively). Regarding treatment, relative to the 1995–2004 period, significant changes in the 2005–2009 period were (1) decreased rate of attempting tumor resection (23 vs. 44?%); (2) increased use of chemotherapy (78 vs. 68?%), and (3) increased use of methotrexate (MTX)-containing regimens (84?vs. 53?%).

In the present study, we investigated the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2) on osteoprotegerin (OPG) synthesis in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells and whether resveratrol affects the OPG synthesis. FGF-2 stimulated both the OPG release and the expression of OPG mRNA. Resveratrol significantly suppressed the FGF-2-stimulated OPG release and the mRNA levels of OPG. SRT1720, an activator of SIRT1, reduced the FGF-2-induced OPG release and the OPG mRNA expression. PD98059, an inhibitor of upstream kinase activating p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, had little effect on the FGF-2-stimulated OPG release. On the other hand, SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SP600125, an inhibitor of stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK), and Akt inhibitor suppressed the OPG release induced by FGF-2. Resveratrol failed to affect the FGF-2-induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase, p38 MAP kinase or SAPK/JNK. The phosphorylation of Akt induced by FGF-2 was significantly suppressed by resveratrol or SRT1720. These findings strongly suggest that resveratrol down-regulates FGF-2-stimulated OPG synthesis through the suppression of the Akt pathway in osteoblasts and that the inhibitory effect of resveratrol is mediated at least in part by SIRT1 activation. ? 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Fibroblast growth factor (FGF-2); Osteoblast; Osteoprotegerin; Resveratrol,"alcohol; lactate dehydrogenase; osteoprotegerin; resveratrol; sodium chloride; 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; 4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 methylsulfinylphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl)imidazole; anthra(1,9-cd)pyrazol-6(2H)-one; anthracene derivative; fibroblast growth factor 2; flavonoid; fused heterocyclic rings; imidazole derivative; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; n [2 [3 (1 piperazinylmethyl)imidazo[2,1 b]thiazol 6 yl]phenyl] 2 quinoxalinecarboxamide; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; osteoprotegerin; protein kinase B; pyridine derivative; recombinant protein; resveratrol; stilbene derivative; stress activated protein kinase; animal cell; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; apoptosis assay; Article; chemical stress; controlled study; cytotoxicity; enzyme assay; flow cytometry; heat stress; in vitro study; mechanical stress; nerve cell necrosis; nerve surgery; neuroprotection; nonhuman; osmotic stress; osteoblast; subarachnoid hemorrhage; treatment outcome; vestibular schwannoma surgery; 3T3 cell line; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; cytology; down regulation; drug effects; genetics; metabolism; mouse; osteoblast; phosphorylation; 3T3 Cells; Animals; Anthracenes; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Down-Regulation; Fibroblast Growth Factor 2; Flavonoids; Heterocyclic Compounds with 4 or More Rings; Imidazoles; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Mice; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Osteoblasts; Osteoprotegerin; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pyridines; Recombinant Proteins; Stilbenes",2-s2.0-84907841512

Because of diagnostic complexity, a standardized method for identifying DILI using MIDs has not yet been established. We applied the Digestive Disease Week Japan 2004 (DDW-J) scale, a Japanese clinical diagnostic criteria for DILI, to a DILI detection algorithm, and compared it with the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences/the Roussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (CIOMS/RUCAM) scale to confirm its consistency. Characteristics of DILI cases identified by the DDW-J algorithm were examined in two Japanese MIDs.METHODS: Using an MID from the Hamamatsu University Hospital, we constructed a DILI detection algorithm on the basis of the DDW-J scale. We then compared the findings between the DDW-J and CIOMS/RUCAM scales. We examined the characteristics of DILI after antibiotic treatment in the Hamamatsu population and a second population that included data from 124 hospitals, which was derived from an MID from the Medical Data Vision Co., Ltd. We performed a multivariate logistic regression analysis to assess the possible DILI risk factors.RESULTS: The concordance rate was 79.4% between DILI patients identified by the DDW-J and CIOMS/RUCAM; the Spearman rank correlation coefficient was 0.952 (P?<?0.0001). Men showed a significantly higher risk for DILI after antibiotic treatments in both MID populations.CONCLUSIONS: The DDW-J and CIOMS/RUCAM algorithms were equivalent for identifying the DILI cases, confirming the utility of our DILI detection method using MIDs. This study provides evidence supporting the use of MID analyses to improve pharmacovigilance.

Entecavir therapy often reduces hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA to an undetectable level, but HBV DNA remain detectable in some patients.We investigated whether baseline HBV reverse transcriptase (rt) polymorphism and quasispecies complexity and diversity were associated with treatment response. Methods. Pretreatment HBV DNA levels, HBV rt sequence, serology, and quasispecies complexity and diversity from 305 entecavir-treated patients were determined. These data were tested for their association with year 1 virological outcome, defined by optimal response (undetectable HBV DNA; lower limit of detection, ?12 IU/mL) or partial response (detectable HBV DNA). Results. Four rt variants were more frequently detected in the 64 partial responders than in the 241 optimal responders (all P < .05). Multivariate analysis revealed that high baseline HBV DNA level (P < .0001; odds ratio [OR], 2.32), HBV e antigen (HBeAg) positivity (P < .001; OR, 3.70), and rt124N (P = .002; OR, 3.06) were associated with a partial entecavir response. Compared with the optimal responders, the partial responders had a lower quasispecies complexity and diversity. Conclusions. Apart from the known factors (high baseline HBV DNA level and HBeAg positivity), a novel single nucleotide polymorphism (rt124N) and lower quasispecies complexity and diversity were associated with partial entecavir response at year 1. ?

However, with the improvements in treatment for primary tumors, the survival rate of patients with spinal metastasis is enhanced. At the same time, surgical technique for spinal metastasis has also improved. Purpose The purpose of this study was to examine trends in the surgical treatment for spinal metastasis and in-hospital patient outcomes on a national level. Study design/setting This was an epidemiologic study using national administrative data from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) database. Patient sample All discharges in the NIS with a diagnosis code of secondary malignant neoplasm of the spinal cord/brain, meninges, or bone who also underwent spinal surgery from 2000 to 2009 were included. Outcome measures Trends in the surgical treatment for spinal metastasis, in-hospital complications and mortality, and resource use were analyzed. Methods The NIS was used to identify patients who underwent surgical treatment for spinal metastasis from 2000 to 2009, using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth revision, Clinical Modification codes. Trends in the surgical treatment for spinal metastasis and in-hospital patient outcomes were analyzed. Results From 2000 to 2009, there was an increasing trend in the population growth-adjusted rate of surgical treatment for spinal metastasis (1.15-1.77 per 100,000; p<.001). Average Elixhauser comorbidity score increased over time (2.6-3.8; p<.001), and the overall in-hospital complication rate increased over time (14.8%-27.7%; p<.001), whereas in-hospital mortality rate and length of hospital stay remained stable over time (5.2%-4.6%, p=.413; 10.6-10.8 days, p=.626). Inflation-adjusted mean hospital charges increased more than two-fold over time ($50,390- $110,173; p<.001). Conclusions During the last decade, surgical treatment for spinal metastasis has increased in the United States. The overall in-hospital complication rate and hospital charges increased, whereas the in-hospital mortality rate and length of hospital stay remained stable. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

To date, only 16 genetically confirmed patients with βUP deficiency have been reported. Here, we report on the clinical, biochemical and molecular findings of 13 Japanese βUP deficient patients. In this group of patients, three novel missense mutations (p.G31S, p.E271K, and p.I286T) and a recently described mutation (p.R326Q) were identified. The p.R326Q mutation was detected in all 13 patients with eight patients being homozygous for this mutation. Screening for the p.R326Q mutation in 110 Japanese individuals showed an allele frequency of 0.9?%. Transient expression of mutant βUP enzymes in HEK293 cells showed that the p.E271K and p.R326Q mutations cause profound decreases in activity (? 1.3?%). Conversely, βUP enzymes containing the p.G31S and p.I286T mutations possess residual activities of 50 and 70?%, respectively, suggesting we cannot exclude the presence of additional mutations in the non-coding region of the UPB1 gene. Analysis of a human βUP homology model revealed that the effects of the mutations (p.G31S, p.E271K, and p.R326Q) on enzyme activity are most likely linked to improper oligomer assembly. Highly variable phenotypes ranging from neurological involvement (including convulsions and autism) to asymptomatic, were observed in diagnosed patients. High prevalence of p.R326Q in the normal Japanese population indicates that βUP deficiency is not as rare as generally considered and screening for βUP deficiency should be included in diagnosis of patients with unexplained neurological abnormalities. ? 2014, The Author(s).",,"amidase; beta-ureidopropionase; allele; brain disease; chemistry; child; deficiency; disorders of purine and pyrimidine metabolism; female; gene frequency; genetics; HEK293 cell line; human; infant; Japan; male; missense mutation; molecular model; motor dysfunction; multiple malformation syndrome; mutation; neurologic disease; newborn; phenotype; preschool child; prevalence; Abnormalities, Multiple; Alleles; Amidohydrolases; Brain Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Gene Frequency; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Male; Models, Molecular; Movement Disorders; Mutation; Mutation, Missense; Nervous System Diseases; Phenotype; Prevalence; Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors",2-s2.0-84893708973

Study Design: A retrospective, multicenter trial was conducted. Methods: Two hundred three patients examined within 7 days after the onset of ISSNHL received prednisone with lipoprostaglandin E1. Pure-tone auditory tests were performed before and after treatment with these drugs. Blood tests were performed on blood samples collected during the patients' initial visit to our clinic. Results: In all patients, elevated white blood cell (WBC) counts, fasting blood sugar levels, HgbA1c, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) significantly correlated with high hearing threshold measurements obtained on the initial visit. High fibrinogen levels, WBC counts, ESR, and low concentrations of fibrinogen degradation products (FDP) were associated with lower hearing recovery rates. Additionally, different audiogram shapes correlated with different blood test factors, indicating that different pathologies were involved. Conclusions: High fibrinogen levels measured within seven days after ISSNHL onset correlated with poorer hearing recovery. This may be a consequence of ischemia or infections in the inner ear. The high WBC counts also observed may therefore reflect an immune response to inner ear damage induced by ischemic changes or infections. Our data indicate that therapeutic strategies should be selected based on the timing of initial treatment relative to ISSNHL onset. ? 2014 Kanzaki et al.",,"fibrinogen; fibrinogen degradation product; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; lipoprostaglandin E1; prednisone; fibrinogen; glucocorticoid; prednisone; prostaglandin E1; article; audiography; auditory threshold; blood sampling; diet restriction; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; fibrinogen blood level; glucose blood level; hearing test; human; human cell; idiopathic disease; idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; multicenter study (topic); perception deafness; prediction; prognosis; protein determination; retrospective study; blood; clinical trial; convalescence; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Hearing Loss, Sudden; metabolism; multicenter study; physiology; prognosis; pure tone audiometry; treatment outcome; Alprostadil; Audiometry, Pure-Tone; Female; Fibrinogen; Glucocorticoids; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Hearing Loss, Sudden; Humans; Male; Prednisone; Prognosis; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84940350483

However, natural killer (NK) cells and γδT cells, which traditionally are classified as innate immune cells, have been shown in recent studies to have hallmark features of memory cells. Invariant NKT cell (iNKT cell)-mediated antitumor effects indicate that iNKT cells are activated in vivo by vaccination with iNKT cell ligand-loaded CD1d+ cells, but not by vaccination with unbound NKT cell ligand. In such models, it previously was thought that the numbers of IFN-γ-producing cells in the spleen returned to the basal level around 1 wk after the vaccination. In the current study, we demonstrate the surprising presence of effector memory-like iNKT cells in the lung. We found long-term antitumor activity in the lungs of mice was enhanced after vaccination with iNKT cell ligand-loaded dendritic cells. Further analyses showed that the KLRG1+ (Killer cell lectin-like receptor subfamily G, member 1-positive) iNKT cells coexpressing CD49d and granzyme A persisted for several months and displayed a potent secondary response to cognate antigen. Finally, analyses of CDR3β by RNA deep sequencing demonstrated that some particular KLRG1+ iNKT-cell clones accumulated, suggesting the selection of certain T-cell receptor repertoires by an antigen. The current findings identifying effector memory-like KLRG1+ iNKT cells in the lung could result in a paradigm shift regarding the basis of newly developed extrathymic iNKT cells and could contribute to the future development of antitumor immunotherapy by uniquely energizing iNKT cells.",,"antineoplastic agent; natural killer cell lectin like receptor; natural killer cell lectin like receptor subfamily g1; unclassified drug; alpha-galactosylceramide; alpha4 integrin; complementarity determining region; galactosylceramide; gamma interferon; granzyme; immunoglobulin receptor; Klrg1 protein, mouse; lymphocyte antigen receptor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; article; cancer immunization; cancer prevention; cell expansion; cell population; controlled study; cytokine production; dendritic cell; effector cell; invariant natural killer T cell; melanoma B16; memory T lymphocyte; mouse; natural killer T cell; nonhuman; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; T lymphocyte activation; animal; biosynthesis; cell survival; classification; complementarity determining region; cytology; genetics; immunological memory; immunology; lung; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; natural killer T cell; Animals; Cell Survival; Complementarity Determining Regions; Dendritic Cells; Galactosylceramides; Granzymes; Immunologic Memory; Integrin alpha4; Interferon-gamma; Lung; Lymphocyte Activation; Mice; Natural Killer T-Cells; Receptors, Antigen, T-Cell, alpha-beta; Receptors, Immunologic",2-s2.0-84906656448

We therefore determined pP-7 carrier state and paraproteins with specificity for P-7 in African-American, European and Japanese patients with MGUS/MM and healthy controls. By isoelectric focusing and ELISA, a paratarg-7-specific paraprotein and the associated pP-7 carrier state was observed in 30/81 (37.0%) African-American, 42/252 (16.7%) European and 7/176 (4.0%) Japanese MGUS/MM patients (p < 0.001). A pP-7 carrier state was found in 11/100 (11.0%) African-American, 8/550 (1.5%) European and 1/278 (0.4%) Japanese healthy controls (p < 0.001), resulting in an odds ratio for MGUS/MM of 4.8 (p < 0.001) among African-American, 13.6 among European (p < 0.001) and 11.5 (p = 0.023) among Japanese carriers of pP-7. We conclude that pP-7 carriers are most prevalent among African-Americans, but a pP-7 carrier state is the strongest molecularly defined single risk factor for MGUS/MM known to date in all three ethnic groups. The high prevalence of pP-7 carriers among African-American patients emphasizes a predominant role of this genetic factor in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The large number of pP7 African-American patients and controls should facilitate the identification of the SNP or mutation underlying the pP-7 carrier state. ? 2014 UICC.",genetics; MGUS; multiple myeloma; risk factors,"paraprotein; paratarg 7 protein; unclassified drug; adult; African American; aged; article; autosomal dominant inheritance; controlled study; ethnicity; Europe; gene mutation; human; incidence; Japanese (people); major clinical study; monoclonal immunoglobulinemia; multiple myeloma; pathogenesis; prevalence; priority journal; protein function; protein phosphorylation; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; genetics; MGUS; multiple myeloma; risk factors; Adult; African Americans; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Europe; Genes, Dominant; Heterozygote; Humans; Isoelectric Focusing; Japan; Middle Aged; Monoclonal Gammopathy of Undetermined Significance; Multiple Myeloma; Mutation; Odds Ratio; Paraproteins; Phosphorylation; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prevalence; Protein Phosphatase 2; Risk Factors; United States",2-s2.0-84902243014

If chemoresistance could be determined before treatment, unnecessary drug administration would be avoided. Here, we investigated chemoresistance factors by comprehensive analyses at the protein level. Methods:Four human carcinoma cell lines were used: cisplatin-sensitive UM-SCC-23, UM-SCC-23-CDDPR with acquired cisplatin resistance, naturally cisplatin-resistant UM-SCC-81B, and UM-SCC-23/WR with acquired 5-fluorouracil resistance. Extracted proteins were labelled with iTRAQ and analysed by tandem mass spectrometry to identify resistance. Protein expression was confirmed by western blotting and functional analysis was carried out using siRNA.Results:Thirteen multiple-drug resistance proteins were identified, as well as seven proteins with specific resistance to cisplatin, including enolase. Differential expression of these proteins in cisplatin-resistant and-sensitive cell lines was confirmed by western blotting. Functional analysis for enolase by siRNA showed that cisplatin sensitivity significantly was increased in UM-SCC-81B and slightly in UM-SCC-23-CDDPR but not in UM-SCC-23/WR cells.Conclusions:We identified proteins thought to mediate anticancer drug resistance using recent proteome technology and identified enolase as a true cisplatin chemoresistance factor. Such proteins could be used as biomarkers for anticancer agent resistance and as targets of cancer therapy. ? 2014 Cancer Research UK.

Storage symptoms are the most frequent among these and associated with overactive bladder and non-bacterial bladder inflammation such as interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Gap junction, a key regulator of hyperactive conditions in the bladder, has been reported to be involved in pathological bladder inflammation. Here we report involvement of gap junction in the etiology of storage symptoms in bladder inflammation. In this study, cyclophosphamide- induced cystitis was adapted as a model of bladder inflammation. Cyclophosphamide-treated mice showed typical storage symptoms including increased urinary frequency and reduced bladder capacity, with concurrent up-regulation of connexin 43 (GJA1), one of the major gap junction proteins in the bladder. In isometric tension study, bladder smooth muscle strips taken from the treated mice showed more pronounced spontaneous contraction than controls, which was attenuated by carbenoxolone, a gap junction inhibitor. In voiding behavior studies, the storage symptoms in the treated mice characterized by frequent voiding were alleviated by 18α-glycyrrhetinic acid, another gap junction inhibitor. These results demonstrate that cyclophosphamide-induced mouse model of cystitis shows clinical storage symptoms related with bladder inflammation and that gap junction in the bladder may be a key molecule of these storage symptoms. Therefore, gap junction in the bladder might be an alternative therapeutic target for storage symptoms in bladder inflammation. ? 2014 Okinami et al.",,"connexin 43; alkylating agent; connexin 43; cyclophosphamide; GJA1 protein, mouse; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bladder capacity; controlled study; cystitis; disease association; female; gap junction; histopathology; lower urinary tract symptom; mouse; nonhuman; pathophysiology; protein expression; smooth muscle contraction; urinary frequency; urine incontinence; animal; Bagg albino mouse; bladder; cell communication; chemically induced; cystitis; disease model; drug effects; gap junction; human; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Alkylating; Cell Communication; Connexin 43; Cyclophosphamide; Cystitis; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Gap Junctions; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Urinary Bladder",2-s2.0-84905484335

Skin disease is commonly caused by a zinc deficiency. Dietary and inherited zinc deficiencies are known to cause alopecia and the development of vesicular or pustular dermatitis. A previous study demonstrated that zinc played crucial roles in the survival of keratinocytes and their unique functions. High levels of zinc have been detected in the epidermis. Epidermal layers are considered to use a mechanism that preferentially takes in zinc, which is involved with the unique functions of keratinocytes. However, few studies have investigated the ZIP (Zrt- and Irt-like protein) proteins specifically expressed in keratinocytes and their functions. We explored the ZIP proteins specifically expressed in the epidermis and analyzed their functions. Gene expression analysis showed that the expression of ZIP2 was consistently higher in the epidermis than in the dermis. Immunohistochemistry analysis confirmed the expression of ZIP2 in differentiating keratinocytes. The expression of ZIP2 was found to be up-regulated by the differentiation induction of cultured keratinocytes. Intracellular zinc levels were decreased in keratinocytes when ZIP2 was knocked down by siRNA, and this subsequently inhibited the differentiation of keratinocytes. Moreover, we demonstrated that ZIP2 knockdown inhibited the normal formation of a three-dimensional cultured epidermis. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that ZIP2, a zinc transporter expressed specifically in the epidermis, and zinc taken up by ZIP2 are necessary for the differentiation of keratinocytes. ? 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Gene expression; Proteins; Epidermal layers; Gene expression analysis; Immunohistochemistry; Keratinocyte differentiation; Keratinocytes; Skin disease; Zinc deficiency; Zinc transporters; Zinc; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; zinc transporter; ZIP2 protein; cation transport protein; primer DNA; SLC39A2 protein, human; Slc39a2 protein, mouse; small interfering RNA; animal cell; animal tissue; article; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell level; cell proliferation; controlled study; dermis; down regulation; epidermis; gene expression; gene silencing; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; intracellular zinc level; keratinocyte; male; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; real time polymerase chain reaction; upregulation; animal; cell differentiation; cytology; genetics; keratinocyte; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; physiology; Animals; Base Sequence; Cation Transport Proteins; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; DNA Primers; Epidermis; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Keratinocytes; Mice; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Small Interfering",2-s2.0-84905385191

However, its molecular actions as well as cellular targets are largely unknown. Here, we uncovered the molecular mechanisms underlying abrogation of the G2 checkpoint by CBP-93872. CBP-93872 specifically abrogates the DNA double-stranded break (DSB) - induced G2 checkpoint through inhibiting maintenance but not initiation of G2 arrest because of specific inhibition of DSB-dependent ATR activation. Hence, ATR-dependent phosphorylation of Nbs1 and replication protein A 2 upon DSB was strongly suppressed in the presence of CBP-93872. CBP-93872 did not seem to inhibit DNA-end resection, but did inhibit Nbs1-dependent and ssDNA-induced ATR activation in vitro in a dose-dependent manner. Taken together, our results suggest that CBP-93872 is an inhibitor of maintenance of the DSB-specific G2 checkpoint and thus might be a strong candidate as the basis for a drug that specifically sensitizes p53-mutated cancer cells to DSB-inducing DNA damage therapy. ?2014 AACR.",,"antineoplastic agent; ATR protein; cbp 93872; nibrin; protein p53; replication factor A; single stranded DNA; unclassified drug; article; concentration response; controlled study; double stranded DNA break; drug mechanism; drug structure; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; in vitro study; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; Aniline Compounds; Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated Proteins; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; DNA Breaks, Double-Stranded; Enzyme Activation; G2 Phase Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Humans; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins; Phosphorylation; Propanolamines; Protein Binding",2-s2.0-84904248535

Chromobox (CBX) 7 is a polycomb repressive complex 1 component that prolongs the lifespan of normal human cells by downregulating the INK4a/ARF expression which promotes cell-cycle progression. However, recent reports studying the relationship between CBX7 expression and patient survival have differed regarding the tumor cell origins, and the precise role of CBX7 in human carcinomas remains obscure. In this study, we analyzed CBX7 expression by immunohistochemistry in 81 OCCA patients and evaluated its association with their clinical outcomes. Both the overall and progression-free survival rates of the CBX7-positive patients were significantly shorter than those of the CBX7-negative patients (p < 0.05). CBX7 knockdown experiments using two OCCA cell lines, TOV21G and KOC-7C, revealed that cell viability was significantly reduced compared to the control cells (p < 0.001). Expression microarray analysis revealed that apoptosis-related genes, particularly tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), were significantly upregulated in CBX7 knockdown cells (p < 0.01). We further confirmed that CBX7 knockdown resulted in TRAIL-induced apoptosis in the OCCA cells. Thus, in this study, we showed for the first time that CBX7 was associated with a decreased OCCA prognosis. We also successfully demonstrated that the TRAIL pathway is a novel target for CBX7 expression modulation in these cells, and therapeutic agents utilizing the TRAIL pathway may be particularly effective for targeted OCCA therapy. What's new? Ovarian cancer is the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, with clear celladenocarcinoma of the ovary (OCCA) having a particularly poor prognosis due to high chemoresistance. Chromobox homolog 7 (CBX7) is a polycomb group transcriptional repressor whose role in human cancer remains controversial. Here, the authors showed for the first time that CBX7 expression is related to worse prognosis in OCCA. Furthermore, knockdown of CBX7 in vitro induced apoptosis in OCCA cell lines, possibly via regulation of the TRAIL-pathway. The findings thus indicate CBX7 as a good prognostic marker, andthe TRAIL-pathway as a potential target for OCCA diagnosis and therapy. ? 2013 UICC.",chromobox homolog 7 (CBX7); expression microarray; immunohistochemistry; ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma; siRNA; TNFSF10 (TRAIL),"ANRIL; chromobox 7; long untranslated RNA; polycomb group protein; tumor necrosis factor related apoptosis inducing ligand; unclassified drug; adult; apoptosis; article; cancer prognosis; CBX7 gene; cell viability; controlled study; disease association; female; gene expression regulation; gene silencing; genetic association; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; microarray analysis; ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma; ovary adenocarcinoma; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; prostate cancer cell line; regulatory mechanism; survival rate; TRAIL gene; chromobox homolog 7 (CBX7); expression microarray; immunohistochemistry; ovarian clear cell adenocarcinoma; siRNA; TNFSF10 (TRAIL); Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell; Apoptosis; Blotting, Western; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; In Situ Nick-End Labeling; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Ovarian Neoplasms; Polycomb Repressive Complex 1; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Small Interfering; Signal Transduction; TNF-Related Apoptosis-Inducing Ligand",2-s2.0-84899998613

Evaluation of the possible anticarcinogenic properties of their ingredients is confounded by the potential increase in risk owing to the high temperatures at which these beverages are generally consumed. We conducted a case-control study to evaluate the association between coffee and tea consumption and the risk of UADT cancer. The study enrolled 961 patients with UADT cancer and 2,883 noncancer outpatients who visited Aichi Cancer Center between 2001 and 2005. Information on coffee and green tea consumption and other lifestyle factors was collected via a self-administered questionnaire. Consumption of three or more cups of coffee per day had a significant inverse association with UADT cancer [odds ratio (OR) 0.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.55-0.96]. In contrast, consumption of three or more cups of green tea per day had a significant positive association with UADT cancer (OR 1.39, 95% CI 1.13-1.70). These associations were evident for head and neck cancer but not for esophageal cancer. The association of coffee consumption with head and neck cancer was observed only among never smokers and alcohol drinkers. Similarly, the association of green tea consumption was observed among never smokers and never alcohol drinkers. No change in these associations was seen on stratification by each confounding factors. These findings suggest that consumption of coffee might be associated with a decreased risk of UADT cancer, whereas that of green tea might be associated with an increased risk. What's new? Coffee and green tea are both thought to protect against cancer; both contain anti-carcinogenic compounds, including caffeine and antioxidants. However, both drinks are generally consumed hot, and damage caused by hot drinks may contribute to esophageal cancer. In this study, the authors investigated the link between coffee and tea consumption and aerodigestive tract cancers. They found that people who drank 3 or more cups of coffee per day were less likely to develop upper aerodigestive tract cancers, while those who drank green tea had a higher risk. ? 2013 UICC.",case-control study; coffee; green tea; head and neck cancer; Japanese,adult; aged; article; cancer prevention; cancer risk; case control study; coffee; controlled study; dietary intake; digestive system cancer; disease association; drinking behavior; esophagus cancer; female; human; Japan; larynx cancer; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; mouth cancer; pharynx cancer; priority journal; respiratory tract cancer; risk assessment; risk reduction; smoking; tea; upper aerodigestive tract cancer; case-control study; coffee; green tea; head and neck cancer; Japanese; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Coffee; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Tea,2-s2.0-84899995416

Here, we report that PARP inhibitors can potentially target ATM deficiency arising in a solid malignancy. We show that ATM protein expression varies between gastric cancer cell lines, with NUGC4 having significantly reduced protein levels. Significant correlation was found between ATM protein expression and sensitivity to the PARP inhibitor olaparib, with NUGC4 being the most sensitive. Moreover, reducing ATM kinase activity using a small-molecule inhibitor (KU55933) or shRNA-mediated depletion of ATM protein enhanced olaparib sensitivity in gastric cancer cell lines with depletion or inactivation of p53.

Methods: Seventy-two mothers of preschool outpatients with HFPDD were randomly assigned to a four-session brief group psychoeducational program (GP). The sessions were held every second week in addition to the usual treatment (GP + treatment as usual [TAU] group), or to a TAU-alone group. The primary outcome was self-reported symptoms of maternal mental health as assessed using the 28-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-28) at 21 weeks post-randomization (week 21). The GHQ-28 at the end of the intervention (week 7), Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) for the behavior of the children, the Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI), and the Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) were carried out at weeks 7 and 21. We tested the group effects with the interaction between the intervention and the evaluation points. Results: The GHQ-28 score at week 21 was significantly higher in the GP + TAU group as compared to that in the TAU-alone group, indicating a greater improvement in the TAU-alone group. There was no evidence that GP + TAU led to a greater improvement of maternal mental health than TAU-alone at week 7. Similarly, no evidence was obtained to indicate that GP + TAU led to a reduction in the ABC or ZBI scores by week 7 or 21. The adjusted scores for the RF (role emotional) and MH (mental health) subscales of the SF-36 at week 21 were also significantly lower in the GP + TAU group, indicating a similar tendency to that of the change of the GHQ-28 score at week 21.

Methods: Fourteen patients with hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies, 7 clinically diagnosed with hypomyelination with atrophy of the basal ganglia and cerebellum (H-ABC), and 7 with unclassified hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy, were analyzed by whole-exome sequencing. The effect of the mutations on microtubule assembly was examined by mapping altered amino acids onto 3-dimensional models of the ab-tubulin heterodimer. Results: Six heterozygous missense mutations in TUBB4A, 5 of which are novel, were identified in 8 patients (6/7 patients with H-ABC [the remaining patient is an atypical case] and 2/7 patients with unclassified hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy). In 4 cases with parental samples available, the mutations occurred de novo. Analysis of 3-dimensional models revealed that the p.Glu410Lys mutation, identified in patients with unclassified hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathy, directly impairs motor protein and/or microtubule- associated protein interactions with microtubules, whereas the other mutations affect longitudinal interactions for maintaining ab-tubulin structure, suggesting different mechanisms in tubulin function impairment. In patients with the p.Glu410Lys mutation, basal ganglia atrophy was unobserved or minimal although extrapyramidal features were detected, suggesting its functional impairment. Conclusions: TUBB4A mutations cause typical H-ABC. Furthermore, TUBB4A mutations associate cases of unclassified hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies with morphologically retained but functionally impaired basal ganglia, suggesting that TUBB4A-related hypomyelinating leukoencephalopathies encompass a broader clinical spectrum than previously expected.

OBJECTIVE.: To analyze trends in spinal fusion for pediatric patients with idiopathic scoliosis on a national level with regard to demographics, blood transfusions, and in-hospital outcomes. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Spinal fusion for pediatric patients with idiopathic scoliosis is required for rapid curve progression. For such patients and their families, blood transfusions and complications are important aspects of the surgery. METHODS.: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample database was used to identify pediatric patients with idiopathic scoliosis who underwent spinal fusion from 2000 to 2009 using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification codes. Demographics of the patients were retrieved. Trends in demographics, blood transfusion methods, and in-hospital outcomes were analyzed. RESULTS.: The total number of patients included in this study was 43,983. A total of 30.4% of patients received a blood transfusion. Predonated autologous blood transfusions decreased over time, whereas perioperative autologous blood transfusions increased over time (P < 0.05, respectively). The in-hospital overall complication rate was 14.4%. The respiratory complication rate was the highest among complications; however, the rate decreased over time (P = 0.003). In-hospital blood transfusion, complication, and mortality rates were high in certain subgroups of patients, such as those with increased Elixhauser Comorbidity Score and those who underwent anterior and posterior fusion. The mean length of hospital stay decreased over time (P = 0.043). CONCLUSION.: During the last decade, 30% of pediatric patients with idiopathic scoliosis who underwent spinal fusion received some type of blood transfusion; and strategies for blood transfusion methods have changed over the years. A decreasing trend in the respiratory complication rate and reduction in length of hospital stay may indicate better postoperative care. ? 2014 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Blood transfusion; Complication; Demographics; Idiopathic scoliosis; Length of hospital stay; Nationwide Inpatient Sample; Pediatric patients; Respiratory complication; Spinal fusion; Trend,adolescent; article; blood autotransfusion; blood transfusion; blood transfusion reaction; child; comorbidity; female; gastrointestinal disease; heart disease; hematoma; human; idiopathic scoliosis; infant; kidney disease; length of stay; lung embolism; major clinical study; male; neurological complication; outcome assessment; pediatric surgery; postoperative complication; preschool child; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; school child; seroma; spine fusion; surgical approach; surgical infection; trend study; urinary tract disease; wound complication; blood transfusion; scoliosis; spine fusion; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; trends; Adolescent; Blood Transfusion; Child; Female; Humans; Length of Stay; Male; Scoliosis; Spinal Fusion; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84902539147

In this study, we utilized a herpes simplex virus (HSV) amplicon expressing murine GM-CSF combined with HF10 (mGM-CSF amplicon), a highly attenuated HSV type 1 strain functioning as a helper virus to strengthen anti-tumor immune response, for the treatment of ovarian cancer with intraperitoneal dissemination. A mouse ovarian cancer cell line, OV2944-HM-1 (HM-1), was intraperitoneally injected, following which HF10 only or the mGM-CSF amplicon was injected intraperitoneally three times. HF10 injection prolonged survival and decreased intraperitoneal dissemination, but to a lesser extent than the mGM-CSF amplicon. Although HF10 replication was not observed in HM-1 cells, expression of VP5, a late gene coding the major capsid protein of HSV, was detected. Moreover, mGM-CSF production was detected in transfected HM-1 cells. Immunohistochemical staining revealed the infiltration of CD4- and CD8-positive cells into the peritoneal tumor(s).

Murine splenic cells after each treatment were stimulated with HM-1 cells, and the strongest immune response was observed in the mice that received mGM-CSF amplicon injections. These results suggested that the mGM-CSF amplicon is a promising agent for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer with intraperitoneal dissemination. What's new? Granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) plays an important role in the maturation of specialized antigen-presenting cells. In this study, the authors used a viral amplicon that was engineered to express the GM-CSF gene, in order to treat disseminated ovarian cancer in a mouse model. Increased T-cell concentrations were observed around the tumors and in the spleen, indicating a strengthened anti-tumor immune response. The GM-CSF amplicon may thus represent a promising therapeutic agent for the treatment of advanced ovarian cancer with intraperitoneal dissemination. ? 2013 UICC.",amplicon; GM-CSF; HSV; immunotherapy; ovarian cancer,"granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; amplicon; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cancer cell culture; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer model; cancer survival; CD4+ T lymphocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; Herpes simplex virus 1; immunohistochemistry; lymphocytic infiltration; mouse; nonhuman; oncolytic virotherapy; ovary cancer; peritoneum tumor; priority journal; spleen cell; survival time; tumor immunity; viral gene therapy; virus gene; virus strain; vp5 gene; amplicon; GM-CSF; HSV; immunotherapy; ovarian cancer; Animals; Capsid Proteins; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; CD8-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cercopithecus aethiops; Female; Genetic Vectors; Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony-Stimulating Factor; Herpesvirus 1, Human; Interferon-gamma; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neoplasm Transplantation; Oncolytic Virotherapy; Ovarian Neoplasms; Survival; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Vero Cells",2-s2.0-84897975482

As a result of these studies, a blinded, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan to determine whether ingestion of bLF had an effect on the growth of colorectal polyps in humans. Patients with colorectal polyps ?5 mm diameter and likely to be adenomas ingested 0, 1.5, or 3.0 g bLF daily for 1 year. Ingestion of 3.0 g bLF suppressed the growth of colorectal polyps and increased the level of serum human lactoferrin in trial participants 63 years old or younger. The purpose of the present study was to investigate correlations between immune parameters and changes in polyp size. Trial participants with regressing polyps had increased NK cell activity, increased serum hLF levels (indicating increased neutrophil activity), and increased numbers of CD4+ cells in the polyps. These findings are consistent with a correlation between higher immune activity and suppression of colorectal polyps. In addition, participants with regressing polyps had lower numbers of PMNs and increased numbers of S100A8+ cells in the polyps, consistent with a correlation between lower inflammatory potential in the colon and suppression of colorectal polyps. Trial participants ingesting bLF had increased serum hLF levels, a possible increase in systemic NK cell activity, and increased numbers of CD4+ and CD161+ cells in the polyps. Taken together, our findings suggest that bLF suppressed colorectal polyps by enhancing immune responsiveness. ? 2014 The Author(s).",Ancillary study of a human clinical trial; Human intestine; Immune function; Ingestion of bovine lactoferrin,"calgranulin A; calgranulin B; CEACAM8 protein, human; cell adhesion molecule; glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchored protein; KLRB1 protein, human; lactoferrin; leukocyte antigen; natural killer cell lectin like receptor subfamily B; animal; blood; bovine; CD4+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; drug effects; human; immunology; Intestinal Polyps; large intestine; metabolism; natural killer cell; neutrophil; oral drug administration; pathology; randomized controlled trial; Administration, Oral; Animals; Antigens, CD; Calgranulin A; Calgranulin B; Cattle; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Cell Adhesion Molecules; GPI-Linked Proteins; Humans; Intestinal Polyps; Intestine, Large; Killer Cells, Natural; Lactoferrin; Neutrophils; NK Cell Lectin-Like Receptor Subfamily B",2-s2.0-84920287470

However, asthma is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the elderly nowadays. In addition, the burden of asthma is more significant in the elderly than in their younger counterparts, particularly with regard to mortality, hospitalization, medical costs or health-related quality of life. Nevertheless, asthma in the elderly is still been underdiagnosed and undertreated. Therefore, it is an imperative task to recognize our current challenges and to set future directions. This project aims to review the current literature and identify unmet needs in the fields of research and practice for asthma in the elderly. This will enable us to find new research directions, propose new therapeutic strategies, and ultimately improve outcomes for elderly people with asthma. There are data to suggest that asthma in older adults is phenotypically different from young patients, with potential impact on the diagnosis, assessment and management in this population. The diagnosis of AIE in older populations relies on the same clinical findings and diagnostic tests used in younger populations, but the interpretation of the clinical data is more difficult. The challenge today is to encourage new research in AIE but to use the existing knowledge we have to make the diagnosis of AIE, educate the patient, develop a therapeutic approach to control the disease, and ultimately provide a better quality of life to our elderly patients. ? 2014 Y??ez et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,allergen; beta adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; cholinergic receptor blocking agent; corticosteroid; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; theophylline; adaptive immunity; age; aged; aging; airway obstruction; asthma; breathing mechanics; chronic obstructive lung disease; clinical assessment; clinical feature; comorbidity; disease association; exercise; human; immunosenescence; infection; life expectancy; lifespan; lifestyle modification; lymphocyte; lymphocyte function; nonhuman; patient compliance; patient education; physiology; pneumonia; pulmonary rehabilitation; respiratory tract disease; Review; senescence; sensitization; survival; weight reduction,2-s2.0-84910645659

The mouse model of IBD was prepared by exposing male C57BL/6J mice to 5% dextran sulfate sodium for 7 days. Inflammation-induced changes in KCa3.1 activity and the expressions of KCa3.1 and its regulators in MLN CD4+ T lymphocytes were monitored by real-time PCR, Western blot, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, patch-clamp, and flow cytometric analyses. Concomitant with an upregulation of KCa3.1a and nucleoside diphosphate kinase B (NDPK-B, a positive KCa3.1 regulator, an increase in KCa3.1 activity was observed in MLN CD4+ T lymphocytes in the IBD model. Pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 elicited the following results: 1 a significant decrease in IBD disease severity, as assessed by diarrhea, visible fecal blood, inflammation, and crypt damage of the colon and MLN enlargement compared with control mice, and 2 the restoration of the expression levels of KCa3.1a, NDPK-B, and Th1 cytokines in IBD model MLN CD4+ T lymphocytes. These findings suggest that the increase in KCa3.1 activity induced by the upregulation of KCa3.1a and NDPK-B may be involved in the pathogenesis of IBD by mediating the enhancement of the proliferative response in MLN CD4+ T lymphocyte and, therefore, that the pharmacological blockade of KCa3.1 may decrease the risk of IBD. ? 2014 the American Physiological Society.",Inflammatory bowel disease; Mesenteric lymph node; TRAM-34,"1 [(2 chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl] 1h pyrazole; complement component C2b; dextran sulfate; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; intermediate conductance calcium activated potassium channel; intermediate conductance calcium activated potassium channel 3.1; nucleoside diphosphate kinase; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; senicapoc; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; 1 [(2 chlorophenyl)diphenylmethyl] 1h pyrazole; dextran sulfate; DNA binding protein; intermediate conductance calcium activated potassium channel; Kcnn4 protein, mouse; Nme2 protein, mouse; nuclear protein; nucleoside diphosphate kinase NM23; pyrazole derivative; Trim27 protein, mouse; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell membrane depolarization; colon injury; controlled study; cytokine production; dextran sodium sulfate-induced colitis; diarrhea; disease severity; down regulation; flow cytometry; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine crypt; lymphadenopathy; lymphocyte proliferation; male; mesentery lymph node; mouse; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; occult blood; patch clamp technique; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; spleen weight; Th1 cell; upregulation; voltage sensitive dye imaging; Western blotting; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; chemically induced disorder; disease model; inflammatory bowel disease; KCa3.1; lymph node; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; TRAM-34; CD4+ T lymphocyte; inflammatory bowel disease; KCa3.1; mesenteric lymph node; TRAM-34; Animals; CD4-Positive T-Lymphocytes; Dextran Sulfate; Disease Models, Animal; DNA-Binding Proteins; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Intermediate-Conductance Calcium-Activated Potassium Channels; Lymph Nodes; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; NM23 Nucleoside Diphosphate Kinases; Nuclear Proteins; Pyrazoles; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-84900794467

Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy has been developed as a novel strategy for generating antitumor immunity as part of cancer treatments. The present study aimed to assess the feasibility and clinical effects of DC therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer (ROC). Methods. This retrospective study included 56 ROC patients who initially received standard chemotherapy followed by DC-based immunotherapy targeting synthesized peptides at 2 institutions between March 2007 and August 2013. The adverse events (AEs) and clinical responses were examined. Results: No serious treatment-related AEs were observed. Seventy one percent of the enrolled patients developed an immunologic response. The median survival time (MST) from ROC diagnosis was 30.4 months, and that from the first vaccination was 14.5 months. Albumin levels of ?4.0 g/dL and lactate dehydrogenase levels of <200 IU/L before vaccination were identified as significant independent factors by multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis. The MST from the first vaccination in patients with albumin levels of ?4.0 and <4.0 g/dL were 19.9 and 11.6 months, respectively. The corresponding disease control rates were 36% and 15%, respectively. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated the feasibility and potential clinical effectiveness of DC-based immunotherapy for ROC patients. Additionally, a good nutritional status might be an important factor for further clinical effects. ? 2014 Kobayashi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",CA125; Dendritic cell; Immunotherapy and recurrent ovarian cancer; MUC1; WT1,"albumin; dendritic cell vaccine; lactate dehydrogenase; penicillin derivative; peptide; picibanil; antineoplastic agent; cancer vaccine; peptide; T lymphocyte receptor; WT1 protein; absence of side effects; adult; aged; article; cancer chemotherapy; dendritic cell; dendritic cell based immunotherapy; disease control; human; human cell; human tissue; immune response; immunotherapy; major clinical study; middle aged; ovary cancer; priority journal; recurrent ovarian cancer; retrospective study; survival time; vaccination; young adult; clinical trial; dendritic cell; female; immunology; lymphocyte count; lymphocyte subpopulation; metabolism; metastasis; mortality; multicenter study; multimodality cancer therapy; Ovarian Neoplasms; pathology; synthesis; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Cancer Vaccines; Combined Modality Therapy; Dendritic Cells; Female; Humans; Immunotherapy; Lymphocyte Count; Lymphocyte Subsets; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ovarian Neoplasms; Peptides; Retrospective Studies; T-Cell Antigen Receptor Specificity; Treatment Outcome; WT1 Proteins; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84900541220

MSM might be particularly vulnerable to sexual victimization and forced sex. The aim of this research study was to examine prevalence of sexual victimization and correlates of forced sex among Japanese MSM. We recruited a sample of 5,731 Japanese MSM who completed an internet-administered survey. Participants reported on history of different types of sexual victimization, unprotected anal sex, other health risk behaviors, exposure to gay-related teasing and bullying, depression, and suicidality. Over one-fifth of the sample (21.4%) reported experiencing at least one form of sexual victimization, and 8.7% reported a history of forced sex. MSM who had ever experienced forced sex were significantly more likely to report experiencing psychological risks (depression OR = 1.55, 95% CI = 1.28-1.89; attempted suicide OR = 2.25, 95% CI = 1.81-2.81; other forms of bullying OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.13-1.68) and other behavioral risks (unprotected anal sex OR = 1.56, 95% CI = 1.29-1.90; sex venue attendance OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.04-1.54; methamphetamine use OR = 1.57, 95% CI = 1.05-1.36), compared to MSM who had not experienced forced sex. Efforts to develop holistic and integrated health services for Japanese MSM are warranted, particularly related to psychosocial determinants of HIV prevention. However, due to cultural factors that emphasize familial and social relations and that stigmatize same-sex behavior, Japanese MSM might experience challenges to seeking social support and health services. Interventions must be provided in safe and non-judgmental settings where Japanese MSM feel comfortable disclosing their health and social support needs. ? 2014 Hidaka et al.",,"adult; aged; anal intercourse; article; child; controlled study; depression; forced sex; homosexual male; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Japanese (people); male; men who have sex with men; middle aged; prevalence; risk assessment; risk factor; school child; sexual behavior; sexual bullying; sexual victimization; social problem; suicide attempt; unprotected sex; very elderly; young adult; adolescent; crime victim; Japan; male homosexuality; psychology; sexual crime; Adolescent; Adult; Crime Victims; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Offenses",2-s2.0-84900420295

They were asked to complete Japanese version of the concerns about recurrence scale and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. The validity and reliability of Japanese version of the concerns about recurrence scale were evaluated statistically. Results: Data were obtained from 375 patients. A novel four-factor solution was found (Health and Death Worries, Womanhood Worries, Self-valued Worries and Role Worries) that accounted for 59.2% of the total variance. Correlation coefficients between the Japanese version of the concerns about recurrence scale subscale scores and the anxiety score measured by Hospital anxiety and depression scale ranged from 0.39 to 0.60. Cronbach's alpha coefficients, which are measures of the internal consistency of the subscales, ranged from 0.86 to 0.94.

The average ages of patients with EGPA (male/female, 5/9), GPA (12/21), and MPA/RLV (35/43) and unclassifiable (9/22) were 58.0, 63.6, 71.1, and 70.6 years, respectively. Myeloperoxidase (MPO)-ANCA and proteinase-3 ANCA positivity was 50.0% and 0% for EGPA, 54.6% and 45.5% for GPA, 97.4% and 2.6% for MPA/RLV, and 93.5% and 3.2% for unclassifiable, respectively. According to the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS), cutaneous (71.4%) and nervous system (92.9%) manifestations were prominent in EGPA and ear, nose, and throat manifestations (84.9%) and chest manifestations (66.7%) in GPA. Renal manifestations developed frequently in MPA/RLV (91.0%) and GPA (63.6%). The average serum creatinine levels were 0.71 mg/dL for EGPA, 1.51 mg/dL for GPA, 2.46 mg/dL for MPA/RLV, and 0.69 mg/dL for unclassifiable. The percentages of patients with ILD were 14.3% for EGPA, 9.0% for GPA, 47.4% for MPA/RLV, and 61.3% for unclassifiable. Patients with ILD (n = 61) had significantly lower BVAS (P = 0.019) with fewer ear, nose, and throat and cardiovascular manifestations than patients without ILD (n = 95).Conclusions: MPO-ANCA-positive MPA/RLV is the most common form of AAV in Japanese patients, and one-half of patients with GPA were positive for MPO-ANCA.

Additionally, conservative region at nucleotide level must be targeted for RNAi in applying to virus because hepatitis C virus (HCV) could escape from therapeutic pressure with genome mutations. In vitro preparation of Dicer-generated siRNAs targeting a conserved, highly ordered HCV 5′ untranslated region are capable of inducing strong RNAi activity. By dissecting the 5′-end of an RNAi-mediated cleavage site in the HCV genome, we identified potent siRNA sequences, which we designate as Dicer-hunting siRNAs (dh-siRNAs). Furthermore, formulation of the dh-siRNAs in an optimized multifunctional envelope-type nano device inhibited ongoing infectious HCV replication in human hepatocytes in vivo.

A total dose of 28 or 28.8 Gy at 80% isodose was administered in 4 fractions for all tumors. The mean gross tumor volume (GTV) was 1.9 cc. Local control (LC) rates at 6, 12, and 18 months were 96%, 91%, and 88%, respectively. The 12-month LC rates for tumors with GTV ?0.25, >0.25 and ?1, and >1 cc were 98%, 82%, and 93%, respectively; the rates were 92% for tumors >3 cc and 100% for >10 cc. The 6-month rates for freedom from distant brain failure were 57%, 71%, and 55% for patients with 1, 2, and >3 brain metastases, respectively. No differences were significant. No major complications were observed. The 4-fraction SRT protocol provided excellent tumor control with minimal toxicity. Distant brain failure was not so frequent, even in patients with multiple tumors.

Its unique morphological feature, called disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid-space hydrocephalus (DESH), may also be a diagnostic feature. Lipocalin-type prostaglandin D synthase (L-PGDS) is a major cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein produced by arachnoid cells, and its concentration in the CSF is reportedly decreased in iNPH. L-PGDS acts as a prostaglandin D2-producing enzyme and behaves as a chaperone to prevent the neurotoxic aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) implicated in Alzheimer's disease, a major comorbidity of iNPH. The aim of this study was to confirm the L-PGDS decrease in DESH-type iNPH and to clarify its relationship with clinico-radiological features or other CSF biomarkers.Methods: We evaluated 22 patients (age: 76.4 ± 4.4 y; males: 10, females: 12) referred for ventriculomegaly without CSF pathway obstruction, and conducted a CSF tap test to determine the surgical indication. CSF concentrations of L-PGDS, Aβ42, Aβ40, and total tau (t-tau) protein were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Clinical symptoms were evaluated by the iNPH grading scale, mini-mental state examination, frontal assessment battery (FAB), and timed up and go test. The extent of DESH was approximated by the callosal angle, and the severity of parenchymal damage was evaluated by the age-related white matter change (ARWMC) score.Results: L-PGDS and t-tau levels in CSF were significantly decreased in DESH patients compared to non-DESH patients (p = 0.013 and p = 0.003, respectively). L-PGDS and t-tau showed a significant positive correlation (Spearman r = 0.753, p < 0.001). Among the clinico-radiological profiles, L-PGDS levels correlated positively with age (Spearman r = 0.602, p = 0.004), callosal angle (Spearman r = 0.592, p = 0.004), and ARWMC scores (Spearman r = 0.652, p = 0.001), but were negatively correlated with FAB scores (Spearman r = 0.641, p = 0.004).Conclusions: Our data support the diagnostic value of L-PGDS as a CSF biomarker for iNPH and suggest a possible interaction between L-PGDS and tau protein. In addition, L-PGDS might work as a surrogate marker for DESH features, white matter damage, and frontal lobe dysfunction. ? 2014 Nishida et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",CSF biomarker; DESH; Frontal lobe dysfunction; Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus; L-PGDS; T-tau; White matter damage,"amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; cholinesterase inhibitor; lipocalin; prostaglandin D synthase; tau protein; age related white matter change; aged; article; brain ventricle dilatation; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical article; controlled study; dementia; disproportionately enlarged subarachnoid space hydrocephalus; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; frontal assessment battery; human; male; meninx disorder; Mini Mental State Examination; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; neuroimaging; normotensive hydrocephalus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; prescription; priority journal; protein cerebrospinal fluid level; protein determination; subarachnoid space",2-s2.0-84899480645

Mogamulizumab (KW-0761) is a defucosylated humanized anti-CCR4 antibody engineered to exert potent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. This multicenter phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of mogamulizumab in patients with relapsed PTCL and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). Patients and Methods: Mogamulizumab (1.0 mg/kg) was administered intravenously once per week for 8 weeks to patients with relapsed CCR4-positive PTCL or CTCL. The primary end point was the overall response rate, and the secondary end points included safety, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 38 patients were enrolled, and 37 patients received mogamulizumab. Objective responses were noted for 13 of 37 patients (35%; 95% CI, 20% to 53%), including five patients (14%) with complete response. The median PFS was 3.0 months (95% CI, 1.6 to 4.9 months), and the median OS was not calculated. The mean maximum and trough mogamulizumab concentrations (± standard deviation) after the eighth infusion were 45.9 ± 9.3 and 29.0 ± 13.3 μg/mL, respectively. The most common adverse events were hematologic events, pyrexia, and skin disorders, all of which were reversible and manageable. Conclusion: Mogamulizumab exhibited clinically meaningful antitumor activity in patients with relapsed PTCL and CTCL, with an acceptable toxicity profile. Further investigation of mogamulizumab for treatment of T-cell lymphoma is warranted. ? 2014 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.",,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; hydrocortisone; mogamulizumab; chemokine receptor CCR4; mogamulizumab; monoclonal antibody; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; antineoplastic activity; article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cancer chemotherapy; cancer immunotherapy; CD25+ T lymphocyte; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cells; chemotherapy induced anemia; clinical article; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; Cytomegalovirus retinitis; drug blood level; drug efficacy; drug eruption; drug fever; drug mechanism; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; esophagitis; febrile neutropenia; female; herpes simplex; human; hypokalemia; hypophosphatemia; infusion related reaction; leukemia relapse; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; male; multicenter study; multiple cycle treatment; natural killer cell; overall survival; peripheral T cell lymphoma; phase 2 clinical trial; pneumonia; polymyositis; priority journal; progression free survival; psoriasis vulgaris; second cancer; side effect; skin toxicity; thrombocytopenia; thrush; treatment duration; treatment outcome; treatment response; treatment withdrawal; drug antagonism; immunology; Japan; middle aged; pathology; survival rate; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Female; Humans; Japan; Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous; Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Receptors, CCR4; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84901432982

Two previous studies reached inconsistent conclusions regarding the effects of APOBEC3B loss on HIV-1 acquisition and pathogenesis. Therefore, it was necessary to verify the effects of APOBEC3B on HIV-1 infection in vivo. Methods: Intact (I) and deletion (D) polymorphisms of APOBEC3B were analyzed using PCR. The syphilis, HBV and HCV infection rates, as well as CD4+ T cell counts and viral loads were compared among three APOBEC3B genotype groups (I/I, D/I, and D/D). HIV-1 replication kinetics was assayed in vitro using primary cells derived from PBMCs. Results: A total of 248 HIV-1-infected Japanese men who have sex with men (MSM) patients and 207 uninfected Japanese MSM were enrolled in this study. The genotype analysis revealed no significant differences between the APOBEC3B genotype ratios of the infected and the uninfected cohorts (p = 0.66). In addition, HIV-1 disease progression parameters were not associated with the APOBEC3B genotype. Furthermore, the PBMCs from D/D and I/I subjects exhibited comparable HIV-1 susceptibility.

Previously, using a lectin-assisted glycoproteomic method, we identified 26 serum glycoproteins as promising glycobiomarker candidates for monitoring the progression of liver diseases. In this study, we identified colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) as a promising LC marker candidate and then established Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA)-reactive CSF1R (WFA+-CSF1R) as a novel possible glycobiomarker candidate by utilizing a glycoproteomics-based strategy. The serum level of WFA+-CSF1R in patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected liver disease was measured by an antibody-lectin sandwich ELISA. In a proof-of-concept experiment of the strategy preceding to future clinical studies, LC patients showed a high serum WFA+-CSF1R level in selected samples (P = 1.3 × 10-17).

A cut-off value of 7.4ng/ml α-fetoprotein was determined for non-sustained virological response; sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and accuracy were 63.6%, 87.5%, 77.8%, 77.8%, and 77.8%, respectively.

They have the nuclease-resistant phosphorothioate bond; the immune responses elicited differ according to the CpG ODN sequence and vaccination method. To develop a CpG ODN that can induce plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC)-mediated TH1 immunity through the mucosa, we constructed phosphodiester G9.1 comprising one palindromic CpG motif with unique polyguanosine-runs that allows degradation similar to naturally occurring bacterial DNA. Methods: TH1 and T H2 immunity activation was evaluated by cytokine production pattern and T-bet/GATA-3 ratio in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and mouse bone marrow cells. Adjuvanticity was evaluated in mice administered G9.1 with diphtheria toxoid (DT) through nasal vaccination. Results: G9.1 exhibited stronger IFN-α-inducing activity than A-class CpG ODN2216 and increased T-bet/GATA-3 ratio by enhancing T-bet expression. Nasally administered G9.1 plus DT induced DT-specific mucosal IgA and serum IgG, but not IgE, responses with antitoxin activity in C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, possibly due to IFN/BAFF production. Induction of TH1, but not TH2, -type Abs depended completely on pDCs, the first in vivo demonstration by CpG ODNs. Conclusions: G9.1 is a promising mucosal adjuvant for induction of pDC-mediated TH1 immunity. ? 2014 Maeyama et al.",,"alpha interferon; B cell activating factor; bacterial DNA; CpG oligodeoxynucleotide; cytokine; diphtheria toxoid; guanosine; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin E; immunoglobulin G; immunological adjuvant; palindromic CpG; phosphodiester oligodeoxynucleotide; polyguanosine; transcription factor GATA 3; transcription factor T bet; unclassified drug; alpha interferon; bacterial DNA; CPG-oligonucleotide; diphtheria toxoid; immunological adjuvant; oligodeoxyribonucleotide; pharmaceutical vehicles and additives; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bone marrow cell; cell stimulation; controlled study; cytokine production; diphtheria; female; GATA 3 gene; gene expression; human; human cell; humoral immunity; immunogenicity; in vivo study; mouse; nonhuman; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; plasmacytoid dendritic cell; protein motif; T bet gene; T lymphocyte activation; Th1 cell; Th2 cell; vaccination; animal; Bagg albino mouse; C57BL mouse; dendritic cell; drug effects; immunology; mononuclear cell; mucosa; Th1 cell; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Adjuvants, Pharmaceutic; Animals; Bone Marrow Cells; Dendritic Cells; Diphtheria Toxoid; DNA, Bacterial; Female; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mucous Membrane; Oligodeoxyribonucleotides; Th1 Cells",2-s2.0-84896119474

The neural substrate underlying the agitated behaviors in dementia is unclear. We hypothesized that different dimensions of agitated behaviors are mediated by distinct neural systems. Methods: All the patients (n=32) underwent single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Using the Agitated Behavior in Dementia scale, we identified the relationships between regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) patterns and the presence of each of three dimensions of agitated behavior (physically agitated behavior, verbally agitated behavior, and psychosis symptoms) in AD patients. Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) software was used to explore these neural correlations. Results: Physically agitated behavior was significantly correlated with lower rCBF values in the right superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann 22) and the right inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 47). Verbally agitated behavior was significantly associated with lower rCBF values in the left inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 46, 44) and the left insula (Brodmann 13). The psychosis symptoms were significantly correlated with lower rCBF values in the right angular gyrus (Brodmann 39) and the right occipital lobe (Brodmann 19).

OBJECTIVE.: The purpose of this study was to examine the trends in the utilization of blood transfusions in spinal fusion in the United States from 2000 to 2009. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA.: Spinal fusion is among the most common surgical procedures that necessitate blood transfusion. Blood transfusion methods include predonated autologous blood transfusion (PR-ABT), perioperative autologous blood transfusion (PE-ABT) (intraoperative and postoperative blood collection), and allogeneic blood transfusion (ALBT). The trends in the utilization of these blood transfusion methods in spinal fusion during the past decade are uncertain. METHODS.: The Nationwide Inpatient Sample was used to identify patients who underwent spinal fusion from 2000 to 2009, using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes. Patients who received PR-ABT, PE-ABT, and ALBT were identified using the appropriate ICD-9-CM codes. Patient demographics, surgical variables, and hospital characteristics data were retrieved. Trends in the utilization of blood transfusions were analyzed. RESULTS.: From 2000 to 2009, there was an increasing trend in the ALBT rate (4.3%-8.0%, P < 0.001) and a decreasing trend in the PR-ABT rate (2.6%-0.7%, P < 0.001) in patients who underwent spinal fusion. The overall blood transfusion and PE-ABT rates remained stable. The ALBT rate was high in the subgroups of patients, such as pediatric and elderly patients, female patients, patients with increased Elixhauser Comorbidity Score, Medicare patients, and patients who underwent thoracolumbar, posterior, and anterior and posterior fusion. CONCLUSION.: During the past decade, the ALBT rate increased, whereas the PR-ABT rate decreased in patients who underwent spinal fusion in US hospitals. The overall blood transfusion rate remained stable; however, it may be reduced by using a patient blood management program, targeting the subgroups of patients with the high ALBT rate. ? 2014 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.",allogeneic blood transfusion; autologous blood transfusion; blood transfusion; comorbidity; Nationwide Inpatient Sample; perioperative blood transfusion; spinal fusion; trend,"adolescent; adult; aged; article; blood autotransfusion; blood transfusion; child; controlled study; Elixhauser Comorbidity Score; female; health care utilization; human; infant; intraoperative period; major clinical study; male; medicare; middle aged; named inventories, questionnaires and rating scales; newborn; postoperative period; preschool child; priority journal; retrospective study; school child; spine fusion; thoracolumbar spine; United States; very elderly; young adult; age; blood transfusion; operative blood loss; sex difference; spine; spine fusion; surgery; trends; utilization; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Loss, Surgical; Blood Transfusion; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Sex Factors; Spinal Fusion; Spine; United States; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84896715079

METHODS.: Using the appropriate International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) codes, patients who underwent spinal fusion from 2004 to 2009 were identified in the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database. These patients were then divided into groups of those who received ALBT and those who did not, using the appropriate ICD-9-CM code. Patient demographics, surgical variables, and hospital characteristics were also retrieved. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictors of ALBT in spinal fusion. RESULTS.: Significant predictors of ALBT in spinal fusion included age, female sex, race status, weight loss, anemia, Elixhauser Comorbidity Score, autologous-related blood transfusion, surgical level, surgical approach, revision surgery, number of fused vertebrae, and insurance status. Pediatric and elderly patients were more likely to receive ALBT than middle-aged patients. African American and Hispanic patients were more likely to receive ALBT than Caucasian patients. As the Elixhauser Comorbidity Score increased, the odds ratio increased (score ?4; odds ratio, 3.07). Thoracolumbar fusion was the strongest predictor among surgery-related variables (odds ratio, 8.56). Private insurance patients were less likely to receive ALBT than Medicare patients. CONCLUSION.: This study identified significant predictors of ALBT in spinal fusion. These factors need to be taken into consideration when developing a patient blood management strategy before surgery. In this study, autologous-related blood transfusion could not avoid ALBT; on the contrary, it was a significant predictor. ? 2014 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.",allogeneic blood transfusion; Nationwide Inpatient Sample; predictor; spinal fusion,"adolescent; adult; African American; aged; allogeneic blood transfusion; anemia; article; blood autotransfusion; blood transfusion; Caucasian; child; controlled study; Elixhauser comorbidity index; female; Hispanic; human; ICD-9-CM; infant; major clinical study; male; middle aged; newborn; preschool child; priority journal; private health insurance; race; reoperation; retrospective study; school child; spine fusion; surgical approach; surgical technique; thoracolumbar spine fusion; United States; very elderly; weight reduction; young adult; age; blood transfusion; factual database; operative blood loss; spine fusion; statistics and numerical data; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Loss, Surgical; Blood Transfusion; Child; Child, Preschool; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Fusion; United States; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84896703163

HLA-DP alleles or haplotypes associated with chronic HBV infection or disease progression have not been fully identified in Asian populations. We performed trans-ethnic association analyses of HLA-DPA1, HLA-DPB1 alleles and haplotypes with hepatitis B virus infection and disease progression among Asian populations comprising Japanese, Korean, Hong Kong, and Thai subjects. To assess the association between HLA-DP and chronic HBV infection and disease progression, we conducted high-resolution (4-digit) HLA-DPA1 and HLA-DPB1 genotyping in a total of 3,167 samples, including HBV patients, HBV-resolved individuals and healthy controls. Trans-ethnic association analyses among Asian populations identified a new risk allele HLA-DPB1*09:01 (P = 1.36x10-6; OR = 1.97; 95% CI, 1.50-2.59) and a new protective allele DPB1*02:01 (P = 5.22x10 -6; OR = 0.68; 95% CI, 0.58-0.81) to chronic HBV infection, in addition to the previously reported alleles. Moreover, DPB1*02:01 was also associated with a decreased risk of disease progression in chronic HBV patients among Asian populations (P = 1.55x10-7; OR = 0.50; 95% CI, 0.39-0.65). Trans-ethnic association analyses identified Asian-specific associations of HLA-DP alleles and haplotypes with HBV infection or disease progression.

We have examined expression of all three receptors in surgically excised breast samples from two archives: (i): 187 invasive ductal breast cancer from a Japanese study; and (ii) 20 lobular and 24 ductal cancers from the Imperial College. Samples contained normal areas, areas of hyperplasia, and in situ and invasive cancer. In the normal areas, ERα was expressed in not more than 10% of epithelium, whereas approximately 80% of epithelial cells expressed ERβ. We found that whereas ductal cancer is a highly proliferative, ERα-positive, ERβ-negative disease, lobular cancer expresses both ERα and ERβ but with very few Ki67-positive cells. ERβ2 was expressed in 32% of the ductal cancers, of which 83% were postmenopausal. In all ERβ2-positive cancers the interductal space was filled with dense collagen, and cell nuclei expressed hypoxia-inducible factor 1α. ERβ2 expression was not confined to malignant cells but was strong in stromal, immune, and endothelial cells. In most of the high-grade invasive ductal cancers neither ERα nor ERβ was expressed, but in the high-grade lobular cancer ERβ was lost and ERα and Ki67 expression were abundant.

Therefore, novel predictive markers of esophageal cancer prognosis are needed. Notch receptors and their ligands have been reported to be upregulated in cervical, lung, colon, renal, and pancreatic cancers, but NOTCH1 expression has not been studied in esophageal cancer. Methods: Expression of NOTCH1 was quantified by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in 55 primary esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (ESCCs) and their paired normal esophageal mucosa. We then examined the correlations between NOTCH1 expression, clinicopathological factors, and prognosis in patients with ESCC. Results: The probability of overall survival was significantly lower for patients with high NOTCH1 expression (p = 0.0028; log-rank test). Overexpression of NOTCH1 was identified as a significant and independent prognostic factor (p = 0.0061) in patients who had undergone surgical treatment for ESCCs.

The data were stratified by demographic variables, including age, sex, race, and hospital region in the United States. RESULTS: From 2000 to 2009, there were 24,059 patients in total; among these, 1,823 (7.6%) had open fractures, and 22,236 (92.4%) had closed fractures. The population growth-adjusted incidence was stable over time (p = 0.431). The incidence was the lowest in the northeastern region. The in-hospital mortality rate in patients with unstable pelvic fracture was 8.3% (21.3% for open fracture, 7.2% for closed fracture) and remained stable over time (p = 0.089). The in-hospital mortality rate was higher in several subgroups of patients, such as older patients, male patients, African-American patients, and patients in the northeastern region. CONCLUSION: During the last decade, the incidence of unstable pelvic fracture has remained stable over time in the United States. The in-hospital mortality rate in patients with unstable pelvic fracture was 8.3% and remained stable over time. The rate in patients with an open fracture was approximately three times higher than that in patients with a closed fracture. The incidence was the lowest, but the in-hospital mortality rate was the highest in the northeastern region compared with the other three regions.

This peptide was also presented on HLA-DRB1 15:02, recognized by CD4 T cells. Notably, HBZ-specific CD4 T cell responses were only observed in ATL patients after allogeneic HCT (4 of 9 patients) and not in nontransplanted ATL patients (0 of 10 patients) or in asymptomatic HTLV-1 carriers (0 of 10 carriers). In addition, in one acute-type patient, HBZ-specific CD4 T cell responses were absent in complete remission before HCT, but they became detectable after allogeneic HCT. We surmise that HTLV-1 transmission from mothers to infants through breast milk in early life induces tolerance to HBZ and results in insufficient HBZspecific T cell responses in HTLV-1 asymptomatic carriers or ATL patients. In contrast, after allogeneic HCT, the reconstituted immune system from donor-derived cells can recognize virus protein HBZ as foreign, and HBZ-specific immune responses are provoked that contribute to the graft-versus-HTLV-1 effect.

However, complications of stapling are occasionally experienced. The aim of this retrospective study was to analyze complications of bronchial stapling. Methods: A retrospective multi-institutional review was conducted by the Central Japan Lung Cancer Surgery Study Group, comprising 29 institutions. All instances of bronchial stapling in thoracic surgery were reviewed during the research period. Results: Bronchial stapling was performed 2,030 times, using 36 kinds of staplers. The total number of complications related to stapling was 36 (1.8 %); 31 events occurred intraoperatively and five events occurred postoperatively. The intraoperative complications were air leakage (N = 20) and stapling failure (N = 11), which were caused by stapler-tissue thickness mismatch (N = 17), stapler defect (N = 3), tissue fragility (N = 2), and unknown reasons (N = 9). In all 31 cases, intraoperative complications were recovered intraoperatively with additional suturing, and no further complications were observed postoperatively. The postoperative complications were bronchopleural fistula (BPF) (N = 4) and bleeding from the chest wall (intercostal artery) (N = 1). The rate of BPF was 0.2 % (4 of 2,030). Two of four BPFs induced critical conditions. Postoperative bleeding was caused by the use of Duet TRSTM. Both total complications and BPF occurred more frequently in the main bronchus than in the lobar or segmental bronchus. No relationship was seen between the incidence of complications and cartridge colors in lobar bronchial stapling. The compression types of staplers were associated with the incidence of complication. Conclusions: Intraoperative and postoperative complications of bronchial stapling were studied. Generally, bronchial stapling in recent thoracic surgery was safe, but rare postoperative complications may induce critical conditions. Knowledge of potential complications and causes of bronchial stapling may decrease the incidence of stapling complications. ? 2013 Soci?t?

Materials and methods: Seven hundred and four (6.0%) patients with lung cancer, aged up to 50 years, were enrolled from among the 11,663 patients registered in the Japanese Lung Cancer Registry Study 2004, and their clinical data were compared with those of 10,959 patients older than 50 years. This epidemiological study is based on the single year registration of surgically treated patients in the major institutes in Japan. Results: The 5-year overall survival rate (5Y-OS) and the 5-year lung cancer-related survival rate was 79.2%/69.0% (p<0.001) and 81.3%/76.6% (p=0.005) in the young/old groups, respectively. In the young/old groups, lobectomy and pneumonectomy was performed in 76.9%/78.0% and 5.7%/3.2%, respectively; adjuvant therapies were given preoperatively in 10.4%/4.7% (p<0.001) and postoperatively in 31.4%/24.5% (p<0.001). The proportions of patients with p-stage IIIA (18.2%) and adenocarcinoma histology (78.7%) were higher in the young group.

Herein, we describe a new method for anatomic mediastinal compartment classification using transverse section computed tomography (CT) images and the use of this method to classify mediastinal lesions, and thus evaluate whether the method is sufficiently user-friendly and useful. In a publication of the Japanese Association for Research on the Thymus (JART), we proposed the following four mediastinal compartments based on transverse CT images: superior portion of mediastinum, anterior mediastinum (prevascular zone), middle mediastinum (peri-tracheoesophageal zone), and posterior mediastinum (paravertebral zone). In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed 445 pathologically proven mediastinal mass lesions, and categorized them into the proposed four compartments by consensus reading. Mass lesions were classified into compartments based on the location of the lesion centroid, and each lesion was satisfactorily categorized into a compartment. Almost all thymic epithelial tumors (99%, 244/246), all 24 thymic malignant lymphomas and a majority of germ cell neoplasms (93%, 54/58) were classified as being in the anterior mediastinum compartment. The majority of intrathoracic goiters (82%, 14/17) were categorized as being in the superior portion of the mediastinum compartment. Approximately two-thirds of mass lesions in the middle mediastinum were cysts, including foregut and pericardial cysts. Approximately 80% of 37 mass lesions in the posterior mediastinum were neurogenic tumors. Correspondingly, 29 of the 49 neurogenic tumors (60%) were categorized as being in the posterior mediastinum, while 10 (20%) were in the superior portion of the mediastinum, 4 (8%) in the anterior mediastinum, and 6 (12%) in the middle mediastinum. Our findings showed that the newly proposed mediastinal compartment classification using transverse images appears to be user-friendly enough for practical clinical application and may be helpful in differential diagnoses.",Compartment; Computed tomography; Differential diagnosis; Mediastinal mass; Mediastinal neoplasm; Mediastinum,"article; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; esophagus cyst; germ cell tumor; goiter; human; image analysis; lung cyst; major clinical study; malignant teratoma; mediastinum cyst; mediastinum tumor; medical society; neurogenic tumor; pathological anatomy; pericardium cyst; priority journal; retrospective study; thymus cancer; thymus lymphoma; tumor classification; tumor localization; Diagnosis, Differential; Goiter, Substernal; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Japan; Lymphoma; Mediastinal Neoplasms; Mediastinum; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial; Retrospective Studies; Thymus Gland; Thymus Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84892427259

Current aggressive treatments frequently lead to cognitive and neurological disabilities in survivors. Novel targeted therapies are required to improve outcome in high-risk medulloblastoma patients and quality of life of survivors. Targeting enzymes controlling epigenetic alterations is a promising approach recently bolstered by the identification of mutations in histone demethylating enzymes in medulloblastoma sequencing efforts. Hypomethylation of lysine 4 in histone 3 (H3K4) is also associated with a dismal prognosis for medulloblastoma patients. Functional characterization of important epigenetic key regulators is urgently needed. Results: We examined the role of the H3K4 modifying enzyme, KDM1A, in medulloblastoma, an enzyme also associated with malignant progression in the closely related tumor, neuroblastoma. Re-analysis of gene expression data and immunohistochemistry of tissue microarrays of human medulloblastomas showed strong KDM1A overexpression in the majority of tumors throughout all molecular subgroups. Interestingly, KDM1A knockdown in medulloblastoma cell lines not only induced apoptosis and suppressed proliferation, but also impaired migratory capacity. Further analyses revealed bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2) as a major KDM1A target gene. BMP2 is known to be involved in development and differentiation of granule neuron precursor cells (GNCPs), one potential cell of origin for medulloblastoma. Treating medulloblastoma cells with the specific KDM1A inhibitor, NCL-1, significantly inhibited growth in vitro. Conclusion: We provide the first evidence that a histone demethylase is functionally involved in the regulation of the malignant phenotype of medulloblastoma cells, and lay a foundation for future evaluation of KDM1A-inihibiting therapies in combating medulloblastoma. ? 2013 Pajtler et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Bone morphogenetic protein 2; Histone modification; LSD1; Migration; NCL-1; SMAD5,,2-s2.0-85005925759

Urine samples were collected for the measurement of albumin concentration, which are expressed as the ratio of urine albumin to creatinine concentration (mg/g Cr). Cross-sectional analyses were also performed of the relationships between urinary albumin and other variables. Urinary albumin was detected in 88.3% of patients, while only 35.4% showed abnormal albuminuria (?30?... mg/g Cr). The presence of abnormal albuminuria was independently correlated with systolic blood pressure, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein by multivariate analysis (P < 0.05). Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis identified systolic blood pressure, serum creatinine, B-type natriuretic peptide, and C-reactive protein as the only factors showing independent correlation with urinary albumin (P < 0.05). Thus, approximately 35% of hypertensive patients had abnormal albuminuria.

To predict the degree of risk for chronicity of HBV, this study determined associations with these SNPs. Methods: The participants for this study were defined into 4 groups; HCC (n = 230), CHB (n = 219), resolved HBV infection (n = 113) and HBV uninfected subjects (n = 123). The HLA-DP SNPs (rs3077, rs9277378 and rs3128917), TCF19 SNP (rs1419881) and EHMT2 SNP (rs652888) were genotyped. Results: Due to similar distribution of genotype frequencies in HCC and CHB, we combined these two groups (HBV carriers). The genotype distribution in HBV carriers relative to those who resolved HBV showed that rs3077 and rs9277378 were significantly associated with protective effects against CHB in minor dominant model (OR = 0.45, p<0.001 and OR = 0.47, p<0.001).

It has also been reported that tumour stromal fibroblasts are necessary for steps in cancer progression, such as angiogenesis. There have been few reports of a correlation between fibroblast actions and IL-6 levels. In this study, we examined the correlation between cancer stromal fibroblasts and IL-6 and the utility of IL-6 as a therapeutic target in human colon cancer.Methods:The expression levels of IL-6 and VEGF of fibroblasts and cancer cell lines were evaluated using real-time PCR and ELISA. The anti-angiogenic effect of inhibiting IL-6 signalling was measured in an angiogenesis model and animal experiment.Results:We demonstrate that stromal fibroblasts isolated from colon cancer produced significant amounts of IL-6 and that colon cancer cells enhanced IL-6 production by stromal fibroblasts. Moreover, IL-6 enhanced VEGF production by fibroblasts, thereby inducing angiogenesis. In vivo, anti-IL6 receptor antibody targeting stromal tissue showed greater anti-tumour activity than did anti-IL6 receptor antibody targeting xenografted cancer cells.Conclusion:Cancer stromal fibroblasts were an important source of IL-6 in colon cancer.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanism underlying the effects of prostaglandin F2α (PGF2α) on osteoprotegerin (OPG) synthesis and of resveratrol on the OPG synthesis in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. PGF2α stimulated both the release of the OPG protein and the expression of OPG mRNA. Treatment with PD98059, SB203580 and SP600125, specific inhibitors of MEK1/2, p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase and stress-activated protein kinase/c-jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) all suppressed the OPG release induced by PGF2α. Resveratrol also significantly reduced the PGF2α-stimulated OPG release and the mRNA levels of OPG. Similarly, treatment with SRT1720, an activator of SIRT1, also suppressed the PGF2α-stimulated OPG release. Resveratrol and SRT1720 both attenuated the phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase, MEK1/2, Raf-1, p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK induced by PGF2α. These findings strongly suggest that resveratrol suppresses PGF2α- stimulated OPG synthesis by inhibiting the MAP kinase pathways in osteoblasts, and that the effect is mediated via SIRT1 activation. ? 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.",Osteoblast; Osteoprotegerin; PGF2α; Resveratrol,"2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone; 4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 methylsulfinylphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl)imidazole; anthra[1,9 cd]pyrazol 6(2h) one; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 2; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; osteoprotegerin; prostaglandin F2 alpha; protein c jun; Raf protein; resveratrol; sirtuin 1; stress activated protein kinase; animal cell; article; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme inhibition; intracellular signaling; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; osteoblast; priority journal; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein secretion; protein synthesis; Osteoblast; Osteoprotegerin; PGF(2α); Resveratrol; 3T3 Cells; Animals; Dinoprost; Gene Expression Regulation; Heterocyclic Compounds with 4 or More Rings; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Osteoblasts; Osteoprotegerin; Phosphorylation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; RNA, Messenger; Stilbenes",2-s2.0-84891596798

Methods. This retrospective study examined prospectively collected data on 219 robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies performed from May 2011 to February 2013. Patients were divided into four groups based on pathologic prostate weight: <30 g, 30-49 g, 50-79 g, and ?80 g. Continence and sexual function were assessed using validated questionnaires. Results: Of the 219 patients, 19, 143, 51, and 6 had prostates weighing <30 g, 30-49 g, 50-79 g, and ?80 g, respectively. Significant differences were found between the preoperative Gleason scores, total operative times, and robotic times of the groups. Both estimated blood loss and anastomosis time tended to be greater in the higher prostate weight groups, but the differences were not significant. No significant differences were observed in transfusion rate, length of catheterization, complication incidence, or positive surgical margins. The return of urinary function, as determined by questionnaire scores, was not affected by prostate weight. Conclusions: Robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy can be performed safely and with similar perioperative outcomes, regardless of prostate weight. Indeed, oncological outcome, urinary continence, and complications were similar across the prostate weight groups, suggesting that robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy with a posterior approach to the seminal vesicle may be performed effectively on men with large prostates, despite greater surgical times. ? 2014 Yasui et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Median lobe; Prostate cancer; Radical prostatectomy; Robot-assisted surgery,"adult; aged; anastomosis; Article; bladder injury; cancer staging; comparative study; controlled study; follow up; Gleason score; human; ileum disease; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; operation duration; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; perioperative period; peroperative complication; postoperative care; postoperative complication; prostate cancer; prostate weight; prostatectomy; rectum injury; retrospective study; robotics; seminal vesicle; sexual function; surgical patient; urine incontinence; urine retention; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blood Loss, Surgical; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Operative Time; Organ Size; Pain, Postoperative; Perioperative Period; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Robotics; Seminal Vesicles; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84892167919

If it is longer than 7 days, tumor volume expansion during SBRT may jeopardize the target dose coverage. In this study, volume change of stage I NSCLC during SBRT was investigated.Methods: Fifty patients undergoing 4-fraction SBRT with a total dose of 48 Gy (n = 36) or 52 Gy (n = 14) were analyzed. CT was taken for registration at the first and third SBRT sessions with an interval of 7 days in all patients. Patient age was 29-87 years (median, 77), and 39 were men. Histology was adenocarcinoma in 28, squamous cell carcinoma in 17, and others in 5. According to the UICC 7th classification, T-stage was T1a in 9 patients, T1b in 27, and T2a in 14. Tumor volumes on the first and 8th days were determined on CT images taken during the exhalation phase, by importing the data into the Dr. View/LINAX image analysis system. After determining the optimal threshold for distinguishing tumor from pulmonary parenchyma, the region above -250 HU was automatically extracted and the tumor volumes were calculated.Results: The median tumor volume was 7.3 ml (range, 0.5-35.7) on day 1 and 7.5 ml (range, 0.5-35.7) on day 8. Volume increase of over 10% was observed in 16 cases (32%); increases by >10 to ?20%, >20 to ?30%, and >30% were observed in 9, 5, and 2 cases, respectively. The increase in the estimated tumor diameter was over 2 mm in 3 cases and 1-2 mm in 6. A decrease of 10% or more was seen in 3 cases. Among the 16 tumors showing a volume increase of over 10%, T-stage was T1a in 2 patients, T1b in 9, and T2a in 5. Histology was adenocarcinoma in 10 patients, squamous cell carcinoma in 5, and others in 1.Conclusions: Volume expansion >10% was observed in 32% of the tumors during the first week of SBRT, possibly due to edema or sustained tumor progression. When planning SBRT, this phenomenon should be taken into account. ? 2014 Tatekawa et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Dosage; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Tumor Burden",2-s2.0-84892168543

The post-translational AAR and AAI could significantly induce the density and localization of plaque deposition in brain tissues. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is reliably related to the formation and aggregation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) plaques in the human brain. No current analytical methods can simultaneously determine AAR and AAI during the degradation of Aβ from AD patients. We now report a covalent chiral derivatized ultraperformance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (CCD-UPLC-MS/MS) method for the determination of post-translational AAR and AAI of N-terminal Aβ (N-Aβ1-5) in human brain tissues. When subjected to tryptic N-Aβ1-5 from post-translationally modified natural Aβ in focal brain tissues by the CCD procedure, it was monitored at m/z 989.6→637.0/678.9 during electrospray collision-induced dissociation. These N-Aβ1-5 fragments with l-aspartic acid (l-Asp), d-Asp, l-isoAsp, and d-isoAsp could be separated using the UPLC system with a conventional reversed-phase column and mobile phase. The quantification of these peptides was determined using a stable isotope [15N]-labeled Aβ1-40 internal standard. The CCD-UPLC-MS/MS assay of potential N-Aβ1-5 allowed for the discovery of the present and ratio levels of these N-Aβ1-5 sequences with l-Asp, d-Asp, l-isoAsp, and d-isoAsp. ? 2013 American Chemical Society.",,"Alzheimer's disease; Amino acid racemizations; Collision-induced dissociation; Internal standards; Post-translational modifications; Reversed-phase columns; Simultaneous determinations; Ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometries; Amino acids; Brain; Glycoproteins; Isomerization; Isomers; Isotopes; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Neurodegenerative diseases; Peptides; Tissue; Tissue engineering; amyloid beta protein; aged; Alzheimer disease; article; brain; brain level; female; genetics; high performance liquid chromatography; human; male; methodology; pathology; physiology; protein processing; tandem mass spectrometry; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Brain; Brain Chemistry; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Female; Humans; Male; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Tandem Mass Spectrometry",2-s2.0-84891780567

Recently, it was revealed that low grade mucosal inflammation and/or immune imbalance of the lower digestive tract is one of the mechanisms involved in symptom generation in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Biobran, arabinoxylan compound derived from rice bran, has been reported to have several biological actions such as anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory effects. So we investigated the therapeutic effects of Biobran in patients with IBS. Method. Forty patients with diarrhea predominant or mixed type IBS were randomly assigned to either a Biobran group for treatment with Biobran or a placebo group. Therapeutic efficacy and IBS symptoms were assessed subjectively by the patients after 4 weeks of administration. Results. The global assessment was effective in 63.2% of the Biobran group and in 30% of the placebo group (P < 0.05, Biobran group versus placebo group). Biobran group showed a significant decrease in the score of diarrhea and constipation and in CRP value. However, no significant changes were observed in the placebo group. Conclusion. The administration of Biobran improved IBS symptoms. It is likely that anti-inflammatory and/or immune modulatory effects of Biobran might be useful in IBS patients. ? 2014 Takeshi Kamiya et al.",,arabinoxylan; biobran; C reactive protein; gastrointestinal agent; placebo; unclassified drug; abdominal discomfort; abdominal pain; adult; Article; clinical article; constipation; controlled study; diarrhea; double blind procedure; drug effect; drug efficacy; female; high performance liquid chromatography; human; indigestion; irritable colon; leukocyte count; loose feces; lymphocyte count; male; middle aged; pilot study; priority journal; protein blood level; randomized controlled trial; rice bran; thrombocyte count,2-s2.0-84934964682

As a novel in vitro system for the evaluation of drug absorption, we characterized a human small intestinal epithelial cell (HIEC) monolayer that differentiated from adult ISCs. Continuous proliferation/differentiation from ISCs consistently conferred the capability of maturation of enterocytes to HIECs over 25 passages. The morphologically matured HIEC monolayer consisted of polarized columnar epithelia with dense microvilli, tight junctions, and desmosomes 8 days after seeding onto culture inserts. Transepithelial electrical resistance across the monolayer was 9-fold lower in HIECs (98.9 Ω x cm2) than in Caco-2 cells (900 Ω x cm2), which indicated that the looseness of the tight junctions in the HIEC monolayer was similar to that in the human small intestine (approximately 40 Ω x cm2). No significant differences were observed in the overall gene expression patterns of the major drug-metabolizing enzymes and transporters between the HIEC and Caco-2 cell monolayers. Furthermore, the functions of P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein in the HIEC monolayer were confirmed by the vectorial transport of marker substrates and their disappearance in the presence of specific inhibitors. The apparent drug permeability values of paracellularly transported compounds (fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran 4000, atenolol, and terbutaline) and nucleoside transporter substrates (didanosine, ribavirin, and doxifluridine) in the HIEC monolayer were markedly higher than those of Caco-2 cells, whereas transcellularly transported drugs (pindolol and midazolam) were equally well permeated. In conclusion, the HIEC monolayer can serve as a novel and superior alternative to the conventional Caco-2 cell monolayer for predicting oral absorption in humans.

We studied 134 consecutive patients undergoing left-sided cardiac catheterization for coronary artery disease (CAD) and examined the relation of epicardial fat volume measured by multi-detector computed tomography to ascending aortic pressure and LV ejection fraction determined by cardiac catheterization as well as indices of LV diastolic function assessed by Doppler echocardiography [early diastolic mitral annular velocity (e′) and a ratio of early diastolic mitral inflow to annular velocities (E/e′)]. Epicardial fat volume indexed to body surface area correlated positively with age (r = 0.24, P < 0.01), body mass index (r = 0.38, P < 0.001), systolic aortic pressure (r = 0.21, P < 0.05), aortic pulse pressure (r = 0.23, P < 0.01), LV ejection fraction (r = 0.22, P < 0.05) and E/e′ (r = 0.24, P < 0.05) and did negatively with e′ (r = ?0.31, P < 0.05). In multivariate linear regression including potential confounders, increased epicardial fat volume index correlated with aortic systolic and pulse pressure and LV diastolic function indices, but not LV ejection fraction.

To understand the actual conditions of HM in the Japanese patients with IBD, the research committee for IBD supported by the Ministry of Health, Welfare and Labor of Japan (IBD-MHWL) conducted a multi-center retrospective study. Methods Questionnaires for the development of HM in IBD patients were sent to the 70 facilities participating with IBD-MHWL in the first survey, followed by the second survey using a more detailed questionnaire, sent to the 27 members with HM patients. Results Out of a total of 36,939 IBD patients in 70 facilities, 28 cases of HM related with IBD [12 of 10,500 UC patients (0.11 %), 16 of 6,310 CD patients (0.25 %)] were analyzed. The numbers of UC patients who developed HM were 2 (0.15 %) from the group receiving and 10 (0.13 %) from the group non-receiving thiopurine, without significant differences. The numbers of CD patients who developed HM were 4 (0.39 %) from the group receiving and 12 (0.21 %) from the group non-receiving thiopurine, without significant differences. The odds ratios of developing HM by thiopurine were 1.37 (95 % CI 0.30–6.24) in UC patients and 1.86 (95 % CI 0.60–5.78) in CD patients. Conclusions Our results suggested that thiopurine therapy may not be a risk factor for HM in Japanese patients with IBD. Further accumulation of cases and prospective studies are necessary to conclude this important issue. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag Tokyo.

Methods: We enrolled 78 Japanese patients with GCK-MODY from 41 families (55 probands diagnosed at the age of 0-14 years and their 23 adult family members). Mutations were identified by direct sequencing or multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification of all exons of the GCK gene. Detailed clinical and laboratory data were collected on the probands using questionnaires, which were sent to the treating physicians. Data on current clinical status and HbA1c levels were also collected from adult patients. Results: A total of 35 different mutations were identified, of which seven were novel. Fasting blood glucose and HbA1c levels of the probands were ?9.3 mmol/l and ?56 mmol/mol (7.3%), respectively, and there was considerable variation in their BMI percentiles (0.4-96.2). In total, 25% of the probands had elevated homeostatic assessment of insulin resistance values, and 58.3% of these had evidence of concomitant Type 2 diabetes in their family. The HbA1c levels for adults were slightly higher, up to 61 mmol/mol (7.8%). The incidence of microvascular complications was low. Out of these 78 people with GCK-MODY and 40 additional family members with hyperglycaemia whose genetic status was unknown, only one had diabetic nephropathy. Conclusions: The molecular and clinical features of GCK-MODY in Japanese people are similar to those of other ethnic populations; however, making a diagnosis of GCK-MODY was more challenging in patients with signs of insulin resistance. ? 2014 The Authors.",,"genomic DNA; glucokinase; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; antidiabetic agent; glucokinase; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; computer program; diabetic nephropathy; diet restriction; exon; family; female; gene identification; glucokinase maturity onset diabetes of the young; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; hyperglycemia; infant; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; microangiopathy; microvascular complication; missense mutation; molecular diagnostics; multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification; newborn; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; physician; amino acid substitution; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; drug effects; family health; gene deletion; genetic association; genetics; incidence; insulin resistance; Japan; metabolism; microvasculature; middle aged; mutation; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; single nucleotide polymorphism; Adult; Aged; Amino Acid Substitution; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Angiopathies; Family Health; Female; Gene Deletion; Genetic Association Studies; Glucokinase; Hemoglobin A, Glycosylated; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Incidence; Insulin Resistance; Japan; Male; Microvessels; Middle Aged; Mutation; Peripheral Vascular Diseases; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-84925944557

In this study, we have developed a five-step xeno-free culture system to efficiently differentiate hiPS cells into insulin-producing cells in vitro. We found that a high NOGGIN concentration is crucial for specifically inducing the differentiation first into pancreatic and duodenal homeobox-1 (PDX 1)-positive pancreatic progenitors and then into neurogenin 3 (NGN3)-expressing pancreatic endocrine progenitors, while suppressing the differentiation into hepatic or intestinal cells. We also found that a combination of 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), exendin-4, and nicotinamide was important for the differentiation into insulin single-positive cells that expressed various pancreatic β-cell markers. Most notably, the differentiated cells contained endogenous C-peptide pools that were released in response to various insulin secretagogues and high levels of glucose. Therefore, our results demonstrate the feasibility of generating hiPS-derived pancreatic β-cells under xeno-free conditions and highlight their potential to treat patients with type 1 diabetes. ?

Several studies confirmed that KIF1A mutations cause spastic paraplegia and sensory neuropathy in an autosomal-recessive fashion.

We identified the second patient with the p.T99M mutation in the KIF1A gene by whole-exome sequencing. He showed severe ID, spasticity, optic atrophy, neurogenic bladder, growth failure and progressive cerebellar atrophy. The p.T99M mutation may be a common recurrent mutation.

Materials and methods: All had histologically proven disease and had received radiotherapy. No patients had AIDS. Among 1054 patients, 696 died and 358 were alive or lost to follow-up. The median follow-up period for surviving patients was 37 months. Results: For all patients, the median survival time was 24 months; the 5 year survival rate was 25.8%. Patients treated with methotrexate-based chemotherapy and radiation had a higher 5 year survival rate (43%) than those treated with radiation alone (14%) and those treated with non-methotrexate chemotherapy plus radiation (20%), but differences in relapse-free survival were smaller among the three groups.

METHODS: Data from a multi-institutional project were collected on 1737 patients who had undergone limited resections (segmentectomy or wedge resection) for T1N0M0 non-small-cell carcinomas. As it was expected, this study was predominantly including ground glass nodules. Computed tomography was used to obtain the ratio of consolidation to the maximal tumour diameter to determine invasive potential of the tumours. Overall and disease-free survivals and recurrence-free proportions were analysed. RESULTS: Median age was 64 years. Mean maximal diameter of the tumours was 1.4 ± 0.5 cm. Overall and recurrence-free survivals after limited lung resection were 94.0 and 91.1% at 5 years, respectively. Recurrence-free proportions were 93.7% at 5 years. Unfavourable prognostic factors in overall survival were lymph node metastasis, interstitial pneumonia, male gender, older age, comorbidities (cardiac disease, diabetes etc.) and consolidation/tumour ratio (C/T) ? 0.25. C/T ? 0.25 predicted good outcomes especially in cT1aN0M0 disease. In a subclass analysis of cT1N0M0 squamous cell carcinomas, wedge resection was the only unfavourable prognostic factor in both overall and disease-free survivals. CONCLUSIONS: If the patient was 75 years old or younger and was judged fit for lobectomy, limited resection for cStage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) showed excellent outcomes and was not inferior to the reported results of lobectomy for small-sized NSCLC. The carcinomas with C/T ? 0.25 rarely recur and are especially good candidates for limited resection. ? The Author 2014.

Several studies have demonstrated decreases of docosahexaenoic acid-containing phosphatidylcholines (DHA-PCs) in the AD brain. In this study, we used matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization imaging mass spectrometry in postmortem AD brain to show that PC molecular species containing stearate and DHA, namely PC(18:0/22:6), was selectively depleted in the gray matter of patients with AD. Moreover, in the brain regions with marked amyloid β (Aβ) deposition, the magnitude of the PC(18:0/22:6) reduction significantly correlated with disease duration. Furthermore, at the molecular level, this depletion was associated with reduced levels of the postsynaptic protein PSD-95 but not the presynaptic protein synaptophysin. Interestingly, this reduction in PC(18:0/22:6) levels did not correlate with the degrees of Aβ deposition and neuronal loss in AD. The analysis of the correlations of key factors and disease duration showed that their effects on the disease time course were arranged in order as Aβ deposition, presynaptic disruption, postsynaptic disruption coupled with PC(18:0/22:6) reduction, and neuronal loss. ? 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Materials and Methods Evaluation of 28 PAVMs in 10 patients previously treated with embolization with platinum coils was performed. The mean observation period after embolization was 49 months. All patients underwent unenhanced chest computed tomography (CT) and time-resolved MR angiography followed by transcatheter digital subtraction angiography within 5 weeks for a definite diagnosis. Two radiologists reviewed the CT and time-resolved MR angiography findings using a blinded method. On CT, the draining veins of the PAVMs were measured before and after embolization, and shrinkage rates were calculated. On time-resolved MR angiography, recanalization was diagnosed when the draining vein or aneurysmal sac or both were enhanced in the pulmonary arterial phase. Correlations between recanalization, the shrinkage rate of the draining vein, and the diagnostic accuracies of CT and time-resolved MR angiography were assessed and compared with digital subtraction angiography. Results Five lesions could not be measured on CT because of metallic artifacts. The mean shrinkage rates of the draining vein for recanalized and occluded PAVMs were 23% ± 19 (SD) for recanalized PAVMs and 47% ± 21 for occluded PAVMs (P =.001). The sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 53%, respectively, when the shrinkage rate threshold was set to 50%. On time-resolved MR angiography, the sensitivity and specificity were 93% and 100%, respectively, for Reader 1 and 100% and 93%, respectively, for Reader 2. The κ coefficient was 0.86. Conclusions Time-resolved MR angiography appears to be a feasible method for PAVM follow-up examinations and to provide a more accurate diagnosis of recanalization compared with unenhanced CT. ? 2014 SIR.",Abbreviations; digital subtraction angiography; DSA; maximum intensity projection; MIP; negative predictive value; NPV; PACE; PAVM; positive predictive value; PPV; pulmonary arteriovenous malformation; pulmonary artery coil embolization; receiver operating characteristic; ROC,"adult; aged; article; artifact; balloon catheter; clinical article; coil embolization; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; digital subtraction angiography; embolization coil; feasibility study; female; follow up; guiding catheter; human; intermethod comparison; magnetic resonance angiography; male; medical device complication; microcatheter; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; platinum coil; predictive value; priority journal; pulmonary arteriovenous fistula; pulmonary arteriovenous malformation recanalization; pulmonary vascular disease; radiologist; sensitivity and specificity; adverse effects; Arteriovenous Malformations; artificial embolism; comparative study; congenital malformation; devices; equipment design; evaluation study; magnetic resonance angiography; middle aged; pathology; procedures; pulmonary artery; pulmonary vein; radiography; reproducibility; time; treatment outcome; platinum; Adult; Aged; Angiography, Digital Subtraction; Arteriovenous Malformations; Artifacts; Embolization, Therapeutic; Equipment Design; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Platinum; Predictive Value of Tests; Pulmonary Artery; Pulmonary Veins; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84923148612

Therefore, epigenetic abnormalities in cancers are emerging as important biomarkers and may have therapeutic potential. The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) is a key epigenetic regulator that catalyses trimethylation of lysine 27 on histone H3 (H3K27me3) via the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, which confers stemness and regulates differentiation during embryonic development. Given these roles of EZH2 and H3K27me3, plastic and dynamic features of cancer cells, especially cancer stem cells (CSCs), may be closely associated with this epigenetic mechanism. In addition, recent sequencing technology revealed that there are many recurrent mutations in polycomb-related genes, including EZH2, in different types of cancers. Therefore, researchers focused on targeting EZH2 as a novel cancer treatment and identified small compounds that inhibit EZH2 activity. Some of them are now under clinical trial in B-cell lymphoma. However, the underlying mechanisms by which PRC2 precisely regulate epigenetic alterations at certain genomic loci under different cellular conditions remain unclear. In this review, I focus on the recent advancements in EZH2 research, especially its dynamic regulation of epigenetic alterations in tumour cells, including the CSC population, and discuss perspectives and challenges for cancer treatment in the near future. ?

The study aims were to use intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) to investigate the mechanism responsible for reduced fractional flow reserve (FFR) after optimal drug-eluting stent (DES) implantation and to evaluate FFR effect on clinical outcomes after optimal percutaneous coronary intervention with DES. Methods: Ninety-seven patients treated with optimal DES implantation under IVUS and pullback FFR guidance were followed clinically (median 17.8 months). Post-stenting IVUS examination and pullback FFR recording were performed, and angiographic and IVUS parameters associated with reduced FFR were evaluated. The composite of major adverse cardiac events (MACE), including cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, and target vessel revascularization, was analyzed. Results: Regression analysis showed inverse correlations between post-stent FFR and residual plaque volume index (r=-0.40, P < 0.01) and residual percent plaque volume(r=-0.68, P < 0.01) in IVUS but no correlation of minimal lesion diameter with quantitative coronary angiography (r = 0.07, p = 0.50) or IVUS-derived minimal stent area (r = 0.02, p = 0.84). MACE was observed in 10 patients (10.3%), and FFR after optimal stenting was significantly lower in this group (0.86 ± 0.04 vs 0.91 ± 0.04, P < 0.01). The optimal FFR threshold for predicting MACE was 0.90, identified by the receiver operating characteristic curve. Conclusions: Reduced FFR after optimal DES implantation was associated with residual plaque volume identified by IVUS and future adverse cardiac events. ? 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Methods: Alternating chemoradiotherapy consisted of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (600 mg/m2/day) on Days 1-6 and cisplatin (80 mg/m2) on Day 7 followed by radiotherapy with 30 Gy. Additional chemoradiotherapy was administered to responders, and laryngectomy was performed in non-responders. The contribution of alternating chemoradiotherapy to laryngeal preservation was compared with that of radiotherapy in patients with T2 disease and with that of laryngectomy in patients with T3/T4 disease. Results: Analysis of 87 patients was conducted. The 5-year overall survival rate of T2 patients (n 1/4 46) was 88.9% for definitive radiotherapy and 82.5% for alternating chemoradiotherapy. The laryngectomy-free rate in T2 patients was 90.5% for definitive radiotherapy and 80.0% for alternating chemoradiotherapy. In patients with T3/T4 disease (n 1/4 41), the 5-year overall survival rate was 86.9% for alternating chemoradiotherapy and 67.4% for laryngectomy. The laryngectomy- free rate in T3/T4 patients was 91.7% for alternating chemoradiotherapy and 0.0% for laryngectomy. Conclusions: In advanced carcinoma of the larynx, alternating chemoradiotherapy treatment might enable larynx preservation. ? The Author 2014. Published by Oxford University Press.

Thymic epithelial malignancies have seen little progress, in part because of the lack of an official system. The International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the International Thymic Malignancies Interest Group assembled a large retrospective database, a multispecialty international committee and carried out extensive analysis to develop proposals for the 8th edition of the stage classification manuals. This tumor, node, metastasis (TNM)-based system is applicable to all types of thymic epithelial malignancies. This article summarizes the proposed definitions of the T, N, and M components and describes how these are combined into stage groups. This represents a major step forward for thymic malignancies.

This article summarizes proposals for classification of the T component of stage classification for use in the 8th edition of the tumor, node, metastasis classification for malignant tumors. This represents the output of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer and the International Thymic Malignancies Interest Group Staging and Prognostics Factor Committee, which assembled and analyzed a worldwide database of 10,808 patients with thymic malignancies from 105 sites. The committee proposes division of the T component into four categories, representing levels of invasion. T1 includes tumors localized to the thymus and anterior mediastinal fat, regardless of capsular invasion, up to and including infiltration through the mediastinal pleura. Invasion of the pericardium is designated as T2. T3 includes tumors with direct involvement of a group of mediastinal structures either singly or in combination: lung, brachiocephalic vein, superior vena cava, chest wall, and phrenic nerve. Invasion of more central structures constitutes T4: aorta and arch vessels, intrapericardial pulmonary artery, myocardium, trachea, and esophagus. Size did not emerge as a useful descriptor for stage classification. This classification of T categories, combined with a classification of N and M categories, provides a basis for a robust tumor, node, metastasis classification system for the 8th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control stage classification.

Evaluating the colorectal cancer risk associated with continued low intake is important. Methods: We used data of 45 516 and 14 549 subjects aged 40-79 years obtained in the baseline and interim surveys, respectively, from the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk (JACC Study). The intake frequency of vegetables and fruits as assessed by a self-administered questionnaire was classified into tertiles of low, middle, and high groups, and the low group was subdivided into 2 equal groups (lower low and higher low groups). Colorectal cancer incidence determined from follow-up was used. Cox's proportional hazard model was employed to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs), adjusting for covariates. Results: During 598 605 person-years of subject follow-up after baseline, we identified 806 colorectal cancer cases. HRs for the lower low versus the middle and high intake frequencies of vegetables and fruits at baseline were 0.95 (95% CI 0.77-1.16) and 1.08 (95% CI 0.90-1.29), respectively. During 125 980 person-years of subject follow-up after the interim survey, 197 colorectal cancer cases were identified.

The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship of coffee consumption with colorectal cancer incidence in a large-scale prospective cohort study in Japan. Methods: We used data from the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk (JACC Study). Here, we analyzed a total of 58 221 persons (23 607 men, 34 614 women) followed from 1988 to the end of 2009. During 738 669 person-years of follow-up for the analysis of colorectal cancer risk with coffee consumption at baseline, we identified 687 cases of colon cancer (355 males and 332 females) and 314 cases of rectal cancer (202 males and 112 females). We used the Cox proportional-hazard regression model to estimate hazard ratio (HR). Results: Compared to those who consumed less than 1 cup of coffee per day, men who consumed 2-3 cups of coffee per day had an HR of 1.26 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.93-1.70), and men who consumed more than 4 cups of coffee per day had an HR of 1.79 (95% CI 1.01-3.18). A statistically significant increase in the risk of colon cancer was associated with increasing coffee consumption among men (P for trend = 0.03). On the other hand, coffee consumption in women was not associated with incident risk of colon cancer. Coffee consumption was also not associated with rectal cancer incidence in men or women. Conclusions: This large-scale population-based cohort study showed that coffee consumption increases the risk of colon cancer among Japanese men. ? 2014 Hiroya Yamada et al.",Coffee; Colorectal cancer; Incidence; Prospective study; The Japan collaborative cohort study,coffee; adult; aged; coffee; Colorectal Neoplasms; epidemiology; female; human; incidence; Japan; male; middle aged; prospective study; risk; Adult; Aged; Coffee; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk,2-s2.0-84921635559

Methods: A questionnaire-based survey of patients with pathologically proven bladder cancer treated by definitive radiation therapy between 2002 and 2006 was conducted by the Japanese Radiation Oncology Study Group, and the clinical records of 159 patients were collected from 17 institutions. Concurrent intra-arterial chemoradiotherapy and concurrent systemic chemoradiotherapy were administered in 51 and 33 patients, respectively. Results: The 5-year overall survival and bladder preservation rates were 48 and 39%, respectively. Eighty-nine (56%) patients developed recurrence (bladder, 48; regional lymph nodes, 4; distant sites, 41). The results of multivariate analysis revealed that adoption of chemotherapy was the only significant prognostic factor for overall survival (relative risk 1/4 0.615 [95% confidence interval: 0.439-0.862], P 1/4 0.005). The type of chemotherapy administered did not significantly affect the local control or overall survival rates. The actuarial 5-year overall survival rates and bladder preservation in the radiation therapy combined with intra-arterial chemotherapy group were 64 and 58%, respectively, and the corresponding rates in the radiation therapy combined with systemic chemotherapy group were 67 and 42%, respectively. Conclusions: The results of this survey revealed the current status of practice of radiation therapy for bladder cancer in Japan. A multi-institutional prospective study is needed based on the results of this study to determine the optimal radiotherapeutic approach, including the need for concurrent chemotherapy and the appropriate chemotherapy regimen for invasive bladder cancer. ?

The pathological diagnoses of the solid lesions included thymoma (n?=?24), thymic carcinoma (n?=?1), mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma (n?=?1), teratoma (n?=?1) and neurofibroma (n?=?1), and those of the cystic lesions included thymic cysts (n?=?8), thymoma (n?=?3), bronchogenic cysts (n?=?2), teratoma, (n?=?1) and a pericardial cyst (n?=?1). The 27 thymomas were composed of stages I (n?=?22), II (n?=?3), III (n?=?1) and IVb (n?=?1). The overall survival in the 43 patients was 97.1?% at 5?years. In the 28 patients with solid lesions, the overall survival was 95.8?% at 5?years. All patients with cystic lesions were still alive at the last follow-up.Conclusion: Cystic lesions of SSAMTs were benign lesions or stage I thymoma, and most of the solid lesions of SSAMTs were stage I or II thymomas. SSAMTs are good candidates for video-assisted thoracic surgery procedures, as conversion to sternotomy can be selected based on the intraoperative findings of pericardial invasion and a rapid pathological diagnosis of thymic carcinoma. ? 2013, Springer Japan.",Small-sized mediastinal tumor; Surgery; Thymoma,"adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; carcinoma; chylothorax; clinical article; cystic lesion; disease classification; female; follow up; human; lung cyst; lymph node metastasis; male; marginal zone lymphoma; mediastinal pleura invasion; mediastinum tumor; medical record review; metastasis; myasthenia gravis; neurofibroma; overall survival; pericardial invasion; pericardium cyst; phrenic nerve metastasis; phrenic nerve paralysis; postoperative complication; preoperative care; preoperative evaluation; rare disease; small sized anterior mediastinal tumor; solid tumor; sternotomy; teratoma; thymic carcinoma; thymoma; thymus cyst; very elderly; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; classification; computer assisted tomography; Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone; Mediastinal Neoplasms; middle aged; neurofibroma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; prognosis; teratoma; thymoma; Thymus Neoplasms; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Humans; Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mediastinal Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neurofibroma; Prognosis; Sternotomy; Teratoma; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Thymoma; Thymus Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84920421657

Primary predictors were municipal socioeconomic conditions (proportion of college graduates, per capita income, unemployment rate, and proportion of households receiving public assistance) and individual socioeconomic conditions (education level and occupation).Results: Among men, the multilevel logistic estimate (standard errors) of proportion of college graduates and unemployment rate for mortality from cardiovascular disease were ?0.399 (0.094) and ?0.343 (0.122), respectively.

Interactions between individual education level and indicators of municipal socioeconomic conditions were observed for mortality from cancer and cardiovascular disease among men and mortality from injuries among women.Conclusion: Municipal and individual socioeconomic conditions were independently and interactively associated with premature death; this suggests that reducing social inequalities in health demands a focus on municipal conditions in addition to those of individuals. ? 2013, International Society of Behavioral Medicine.",Geographic context; Japan; Mortality; Socioeconomic condition,adult; aged; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; demography; educational status; epidemiology; female; human; income; injury; Japan; male; middle aged; mortality; multilevel analysis; neoplasm; occupation; social class; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; unemployment; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Income; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Multilevel Analysis; Neoplasms; Occupations; Residence Characteristics; Social Class; Socioeconomic Factors; Unemployment; Wounds and Injuries,2-s2.0-84919904822

However, we believe that communication between healthcare providers and patients may be limited by overestimation of patients’ recognition level of medical terms by providers. The purpose of this study was to clarify patients’ recognition level of medical terms, mainly related to drugs, as estimated by pharmacists to contribute to improving risk communication in the medical care field.Methods: A total of 211 medical doctors and 212 pharmacists were surveyed. Differences between patients’ recognition level of medical terms as estimated by medical doctors and pharmacists were assessed. In total, 90 medical terms were evaluated, including 57 medical terms from the National Institute for Japanese Language and an additional 33 medical terms.Results: Patient’s recognition level of the selected medical terms as estimated by pharmacists was higher than that estimated by medical doctors.Conclusions: Compared with medical doctors, pharmacists tend to overestimate patients’ recognition level of medical terms. Therefore, pharmacists need to take greater care to ensure that their patients fully understand the risks and benefits of the drugs. ? 2014, The Japanese Society for Hygiene.",Medical term; Perception gap; Regulatory science; Risk communication; Shared decision-making,"adult; aged; Article; caregiver; decision making; demography; female; health care personnel; human; intensive care; major clinical study; male; medical care; palliative therapy; perception; pharmacist; physician; practice guideline; recognition; risk assessment; Stevens Johnson syndrome; tachycardia; health literacy; health personnel attitude; human relation; Japan; middle aged; patient; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Attitude of Health Personnel; Female; Health Literacy; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Patients; Pharmacists; Physicians; Professional-Patient Relations; Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84919794392

We also reported that treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) increased the UNaV during the daytime, and restored the non-dipper blood pressure (BP) rhythm into a dipper pattern. However, the circadian rhythm of UKV during ARB treatment has not been reported. Materials and methods: Circadian rhythms of UNaV and UKV were examined in 44 patients with CKD undergoing treatment with ARB. Results: Whole-day UNaV was not altered by ARB whereas whole-day UKV decreased. Even during the ARB treatment, the significant relationship persisted between the night/day ratios of UNaV and UKV (r=0.56, p < 0.0001). Whole-day UKV/ UNaV ratio (p=0.0007) and trans-tubular potassium concentration gradient (p=0.002) were attenuated but their night/ day ratios remained unchanged. The change in the night/day UKV ratio correlated directly with the change in night/day UNaV ratio (F=20.4) rather than with the changes in aldosterone, BP or creatinine clearance. Conclusions: The circadian rhythm of UKV was determined by the rhythm of UNaV even during ARB treatment. Changes in the circadian UKV rhythm were not determined by aldosterone but by UNaV. ?

Conjugation of the Cur-NPs with anti-P-glycoprotein (P-gp) antibody (Cur-NPs-APgp) may increase their targeting to P-gp, which is highly expressed in multidrugresistance (MDR) cancer cells. This study determined whether Cur-NPs-APgp could overcome MDR in a human cervical cancer model (KB-V1 cells) in vitro and in vivo. Materials and Methods: First, we determined the MDRreversing property of Cur in P-gp-overexpressing KB-V1 cells in vitro and in vivo. Cur-NPs and Cur-NPs-APgp, in the range 150-180 nm, were constructed and subjected to an in vivo pharmacokinetic study compared with Cur. The in vitro and in vivo MDR-reversing properties of Cur-NPs and Cur-NPs-APgp were then investigated. Moreover, the stability of the NPs was determined in various solutions. Results: The combined treatment of paclitaxel (PTX) with Cur dramatically decreased cell viability and tumor growth compared to PTX treatment alone. After intravenous injection, Cur-NPs-APgp and Cur-NPs could be detected in the serum up to 60 and 120 min later, respectively, whereas Cur was not detected after 30 min. Pretreatment with Cur-NPs-APgp, but not with NPs or Cur-NPs, could enhance PTX sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo. The constructed NPs remained a consistent size, proving their stability in various solutions. Conclusions: Our functional Cur-NPs-APgp may be a suitable candidate for application in a drug delivery system for overcoming drug resistance.

In computed tomographic measurements, elderly patients with asthma had significantly greater airway wall thickening and air trapping than nonelderly patients. Impulse oscillation measurements indicated that elderly patients with asthma showed significantly greater resistance at 5 Hz (used as an index of total airway resistance), greater decrease in resistance from 5 to 20 Hz, a higher ratio of decrease in resistance from 5 to 20 Hz to resistance at 5 Hz, higher integrated area between 5 Hz and frequency of resonance, greater frequency of resonance, and lower reactance at a frequency of 5 Hz (potential markers of small airway disease) than nonelderly patients. There were no significant differences in blood or sputum cell differentials, exhaled nitric oxide, or methacholine airway responsiveness between the 2 groups. Total serum IgE levels and positive rates of specific IgE antibodies against several allergens were significantly lower in elderly than in nonelderly patients with asthma.Conclusion Based on spirometric, computed tomographic, and impulse oscillation analyses, elderly patients with asthma have greater involvement of small and large airways than nonelderly patients with asthma.Background Comprehensive studies of the pathophysiologic characteristics of elderly asthma, including predominant site of disease, airway inflammation profiles, and airway hyperresponsiveness, are scarce despite their clinical importance.Objective To clarify the pathophysiologic characteristics of elderly patients with asthma.Methods Patients older than 65 years (elderly; n = 45) vs those no older than 65 years (nonelderly; n = 67) were retrospectively analyzed by spirometry, computed tomographic indices of large airway wall thickness and small airway involvement (air trapping), impulse oscillation measurements, exhaled nitric oxide levels, blood and induced sputum cell differentials, methacholine airway responsiveness, and total and specific serum IgE levels. ? 2014 American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology.

Medical records and images were reviewed, and the technical success rate, surgical success rate and complications were evaluated. Technical success was defined as successful hookwire marking at the target site without marker dropping before VATS. Surgical success was defined as negative surgical margins on pathological examination after VATS.Purpose The aim of this study was to evaluate the technical and clinical efficacy and safety of CT-guided hookwire marking before video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for small pulmonary lesions.Results There were 97 nodules and 64 ground-glass opacities, and their mean size was 9.8 mm (range 2-34). The technical success rate was 97.5% (157/161). In three of the four failed cases, another hookwire marker was placed, and in the remaining case, VATS was performed without a marker. The surgical success rate was 98.1% (158/161). In the three failed cases, the margin was positive, so lung lobectomy was performed in one case, and the other two cases were observed carefully. Complication rates were as follows: pneumothorax, 37.9% (61/161); focal intrapulmonary haemorrhage, 34.8% (58/139); haemoptysis, 0.6% (1/161); haemothorax, 0% (0/161); air embolism, 0.6% (1/161); dissemination, 0% (0/161); and death, 0% (0/161).Conclusion CT-guided hookwire marking appears to be useful for VATS, but the procedure may, although rarely, cause severe complications such as air embolism. ? 2014 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",air embolism; CT-guided marking; hookwire; video-assisted thoracic surgery,adult; aged; air embolism; Article; computer assisted tomography; disease marker; female; fluoroscopy; hematothorax; hemoptysis; human; human tissue; image analysis; lung cancer; lung hemorrhage; lung lobectomy; lung nodule; major clinical study; male; marginal zone lymphoma; medical record review; patient safety; pneumothorax; retrospective study; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery,2-s2.0-84914154150

Methods and materials: Thirty patients with 40 VM were treated with SIB-IMRT as initial radiation therapy. Either 40 Gy in 8 fractions or 48 Gy in 16 fractions was prescribed depending on the Katagiri prognostic index. The radiation doses to the spinal cord and other risk organs were reduced to tolerance levels using intensity modulation. One to 4 lesions in consecutive vertebrae were treated in 1 course of SIB-IMRT. Radiologic and physical examinations were performed at 1-3 month intervals after SIB-IMRT. The Barthel index (BI) and numerical rating scale (NRS) were used to evaluate activities of daily living (ADL) and pain status, respectively. Results: The median follow-up period was 8 months. The NRS significantly dropped at 1 month after SIB-IMRT (. P < .0001) and the effect continued for over 2 months. No significant BI decrease was observed at 2 months after SIB-IMRT (. P = .7).

However, there have been few comprehensive analyses of its efficacy, includingassessments of small airways or airway remodeling.Objective: To comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of omalizumab, including its effects on small airwaysand airway remodeling, in adult patients with severe refractory asthma.Methods: In this prospective, time-series, single-arm observational study, 31 adult patients with severerefractory asthma despite the use of multiple controller medications, including high-dose inhaled corticosteroids(1,432 - 581 mg/d of fluticasone propionate equivalent), were enrolled. Clinical variables, includingAsthma Quality of Life Questionnaire, asthma exacerbations, exhaled nitric oxide, pulmonary function,methacholine airway responsiveness, induced sputum, and chest computed tomogram, were assessed atbaseline and after 16 and 48 weeks of treatment with omalizumab.Results: Twenty-six of the 31 patients completed 48 weeks of treatment.

There is no effective treatment except for complete resection, and the prognosis of advanced cases is poor. To identify the mutations associated with tumorigenesis, we analyzed genetic profile of thymic carcinoma using targeted next-generation sequencing.

We filtered the mutations with Ingenuity Variant Analysis, SIFT, PolyPhen-2, and PROVEAN. Results and conclusion: Twenty-five candidate mutations in 24 genes were identified, including five tyrosine kinase genes (. KIT, DDR2, PDGFRA, ROS1, IGF1R). There was no recurrent mutation among the samples studied. The KIT exon 11 deletion mutation in 1 patient was an activating mutation and may be an oncogenic driver mutation.

In the clinical study, target contours were compared between stereotactic MRI and diagnostic MRI co-registered with stereotactic CT. The mean errors of coordinates between images were < 1 mm in all measurement areas in both the phantom and clinical patient studies.

Pancreatographic findings such as a long narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, lack of upstream dilatation, skipped narrowed lesions, and side branches arising from the narrowed portion suggest AIP rather than pancreatic carcinoma. Cholangiographic findings for PSC, including band-like stricture, beaded or pruned-tree appearance, or diverticulum-like outpouching are rarely observed in IgG4-SC patients, whereas dilatation after a long stricture of the bile duct is common in IgG4-SC. Transpapillary biopsy for bile duct stricture is useful to rule out cholangiocarcinoma and to support the diagnosis of IgG4-SC with IgG4-immunostaining. IgG4-immunostaining of biopsy specimens from the major papilla advances a diagnosis of AIP. Contrast-enhanced endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and EUS elastography have the potential to predict the histological nature of the lesions. Intraductal ultrasonographic finding of wall thickening in the non-stenotic bile duct on cholangiography is useful for distinguishing IgG4-SC from cholangiocarcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) is widely used to exclude pancreatic carcinoma. To obtain adequate tissue samples for the histological diagnosis of AIP, EUS-Tru-cut biopsy or EUS-FNA using a 19-gauge needle is recommended, but EUS-FNA with a 22-gauge needle can also provide sufficient histological samples with careful sample processing after collection and rapid motion of the FNA needles within the pancreas. Validation of endoscopic imaging criteria and new techniques or devices to increase the diagnostic yield of endoscopic tissue sampling should be developed. ? 2014 The Authors.

The chest wall is the most common neighboring structure involved by locally advanced lung cancers. However, the optimal treatment strategy for such tumors has not been established. This phase II trial was therefore conducted with the aim of evaluating whether induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery improves the survival of patients with T3N0 or T3N1 lung cancer involving the chest wall.Methods. Patients with resectable T3N0 or T3N1 nonsmall cell lung cancer involving the chest wall were candidates for this study. Induction therapy consisted of two cycles of cisplatin and vinorelbine chemotherapy concurrent with 40 Gy of radiation. Surgical resection was performed 3 to 6 weeks after the last day of chemotherapy.Results. From January 2009 to November 2012, 51 eligible patients (40 stage IIB and 11 stage IIIA tumors) were entered in this study. Induction therapy wa completed as planned in 49 (96%) patients, and 25 (51%) had a partial response revealed on computed tomography. Forty-eight patients underwent pulmonary resection combined with chest wall resection, and 44 (92%) underwent a complete resection. Pathologic examinations of the resected specimens revealed no viable tumor cells in 12 (25%) cases and minimal residual disease in 31 (65%) cases. Five patients experienced major postoperative complications, and 1 patient died of postoperative exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia.Conclusions. The initial results of this study showed the treatment regimen to be safe and feasible with a high rate of a pathologic response for patients with lung cancer involving the chest wall in a multiinstitutional setting. ? 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",,"cisplatin; navelbine; adult; aged; air embolism; anemia; anorexia; bronchopleural fistula; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cell viability; chemoradiotherapy; chemotherapy induced anemia; chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting; chylothorax; computer assisted tomography; Conference Paper; diarrhea; disease exacerbation; drug toxicity; duodenum perforation; empyema; feasibility study; febrile neutropenia; female; heart arrhythmia; histopathology; human; induction chemotherapy; infection complication; interstitial pneumonia; leukopenia; lung cancer cell line; lung embolism; lung resection; major clinical study; male; minimal residual disease; multimodality cancer therapy; multiple cycle treatment; neutropenia; non small cell lung cancer; patient safety; phase 2 clinical trial; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; prospective study; radiation fibrosis; radiation injury; radiation pneumonia; radiation sickness; respiratory failure; thorax surgery; thorax wall cancer; treatment response; tumor invasion; ulcer perforation; cancer staging; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; chemoradiotherapy; clinical trial; Lung Neoplasms; lung resection; middle aged; mortality; multimodality cancer therapy; pathology; thorax wall; tumor invasion; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Chemoradiotherapy; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Induction Chemotherapy; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Pneumonectomy; Thoracic Wall",2-s2.0-84908101105

Methods: The study cohort comprised 708 consecutive male patients with clinically localized prostate cancer who underwent laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (n = 551) or robotassisted radical prostatectomy (n = 157) between January 1999 and September 2012. Operative time, estimated blood loss, complications, and positive surgical margins frequency were compared between laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy. Results: There were no significant differences in age or body mass index between the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy and robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients. Prostate-specific antigen levels, Gleason sum and clinical stage of the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients were significantly higher than those of the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy patients. Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients suffered significantly less bleeding (P < 0.05). The overall frequency of positive surgical margins was 30.6% (n = 167; 225 sites) in the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group and 27.5% (n = 42; 58 sites) in the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy group. In the laparoscopic radical prostatectomy group, positive surgical margins were detected in the apex (52.0%), anterior (5.3%), posterior (5.3%) and lateral regions (22.7%) of the prostate, as well as in the bladder neck (14.7%). In the robot-assisted radical prostatectomy patients, they were observed in the apex, anterior, posterior, and lateral regions of the prostate in 43.0%, 6.9%, 25.9% and 15.5% of patients, respectively, as well as in the bladder neck in 8.6% of patients. Conclusions: Positive surgical margin distributions after robot-assisted radical prostatectomy and laparoscopic radical prostatectomy are significantly different. The only disadvantage of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy is the lack of tactile feedback. Thus, the robotic surgeon needs to take this into account to minimize the risk of positive surgical margins. ? 2014 The Japanese Urological Association.",Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy; Positive surgical margin; Prostate cancer; Retropubic radical prostatectomy; Robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy,"prostate specific antigen; adult; aged; Article; bladder neck; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer surgery; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; Gleason score; human; intermethod comparison; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; medical record review; operation duration; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; robot assisted radical prostatectomy; robotics; surgical risk; tactile feedback; adverse effects; comparative study; laparoscopy; middle aged; minimal residual disease; operative blood loss; pathology; procedures; prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; robotic surgical procedure; Adult; Aged; Blood Loss, Surgical; Cohort Studies; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm, Residual; Operative Time; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Robotic Surgical Procedures",2-s2.0-84908029705

We additionally established xenograft mouse models with GIST-T1 tumors and examined the accumulation and antitumor effects of these photosensitizers in vivo. In vitro, the expression of the glucose transportersGLUT1,GLUT3,andGLUT4,the cellular uptake ofH2TFPC-SGlc,and apoptosis mediated by PDT withH2TFPC-SGlc were significantly higher in GIST-T1 than in WI-38 cells. In vivo, H2TFPC-SGlc accumulation was higher in xenograft tumors of GIST-T1 cells than in the adjacent normal tissue, and tumor growth was significantly suppressed following PDT. PDT with novel H2TFPC-SGlc is potentially useful for clinical applications about the treatment of GIST.

However, the geometric accuracy seems unavoidably worse in wide-bore MR imaging than in conventional MR imaging. We assessed the geometric distortion of the stereotactic image attached on a Leksell skull frame in conventional and wide-bore 1.5-T MR imaging. Two kinds of acrylic phantoms were placed on the skull frame and were scanned using computed tomography (CT) and conventional and wide-bore 1.5-T MR imaging. The three-dimensional coordinates on both MR imaging were compared with those on CT. Deviations of measured coordinates at selected points (x = 50, 100, 150 mm; y = 50, 100, 150 mm) were indicated on different axial planes (z = 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 mm). The differences of coordinates were less than 1.0 mm in the entire treatable area for conventional MR imaging. With the large bore system, the differences of the coordinates were less than 1.0 mm around the center but substantially exceeded 1.0 mm in the peripheral regions. Further study is needed to increase the geometric accuracy of wide-bore MR imaging for stereotactic radiosurgery treatment planning. ? 2014 The Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Radiologists.",Image distortion; Short-bore magnetic resonance imaging; Stereotactic localization; Stereotactic radiosurgery; Wide-bore magnetic resonance imaging,"Article; gamma knife; geometry; health care; human; imaging phantom; intermethod comparison; measurement accuracy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; skull; stereotactic radiosurgery; anatomy and histology; comparative study; device failure analysis; devices; equipment design; evaluation study; image quality; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; radiosurgery; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; skull; stereotactic procedure; surgery; three dimensional imaging; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Phantoms, Imaging; Radiosurgery; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Skull; Stereotaxic Techniques",2-s2.0-84907923254

However, molecular characteristics of PD-CRC remain unknown to date, particularly in molecular targeting therapy for patients with PD-CRC. In this study, we examined the expression of EGFR, HER2 and HER3 in PD-CRC by immunohistochemical analysis of archived clinical specimens of primary tumors and investigated the sensitivity of PD-CRC cell lines to gefitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor for EGFR in vitro. We found that HER3 expression of PD-CRC among members of the HER family was significantly lower than that of well to moderately differentiated CRC (WMD-CRC) and 37% of the PD cases showed a EGFR+/HER2+/HER3- expression pattern. COLM-5 cells, a PD-CRC-derived cell line, which exhibits EGFR +/HER2+/HER3- expression pattern and recapitulates the typical histology of PD-CRC in xenografted tumors, showed high gefitinib sensitivity both in vitro and in vivo, compared with WMD-CRC cell line (COLM-2). Treatment with gefitinib resulted in the upregulation of p27 Kip1 expression and induction of G1 cell cycle arrest, concomitantly associated with inactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling in COLM-5 cells and marked inhibition of xenografted tumors in nude mice, but not evident in COLM-2 cells. Treatment with sodium butyrate, an HDAC inhibitor that induces differentiation, upregulated the expression of HER3 associated with enhancement of the PI3K/Akt signaling, attenuated gefitinib-mediated p27Kip1 upregulation and reduced gefitinib sensitivity in COLM-5 cells in vitro. Furthermore, enforced expression of HER3 in COLM-5 cells resulted in significant resistance to gefitinib treatment both in vitro and in vivo. These findings suggest that deficient HER3 expression plays an important role in gefitinib sensitivity and that a malignant subset of PD with EGFR+/HER2+/HER3 - phenotype is a potential candidate for a target of anti-EGFR molecular therapy such as gefitinib.",EGFR; Gefitinib; HER3; P27; Poorly-differentiated colorectal cancer,"butyric acid; caspase 3; caspase 7; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epidermal growth factor receptor 3; gefitinib; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; antineoplastic agent; butyric acid; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 3; ERBB2 protein, human; ERBB3 protein, human; gefitinib; quinazoline derivative; animal experiment; animal model; article; cancer inhibition; colorectal cancer; colorectal cancer cell line; colorectal liver metastasis; controlled study; drug sensitivity; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; human tissue; in vitro study; lung metastasis; male; mouse; nonhuman; poorly differentiated colorectal cancer; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; signal transduction; tumor differentiation; tumor xenograft; animal; cell cycle; cell differentiation; Colorectal Neoplasms; drug effects; drug screening; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; nude mouse; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Butyric Acid; Cell Cycle; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line, Tumor; Colorectal Neoplasms; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Nude; Quinazolines; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptor, ErbB-3; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84907476441

Subsequent reports revealed that IL28B genotypes also affect treatment efficacy in chronic infection with other HCV genotypes. Furthermore, there have been several reports that implicate IL28B genotypes in inflammatory status, progression of fibrosis and adverse clinical outcomes in chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Therapy of CHC recently entered a new era with the deployment of direct-acting antivirals. These include nonstructural 3/4A protease inhibitors which have shown promise in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV in several clinical trials. IFN-free therapy is expected to be useful especially in IFN-resistant patients and may become the standard of care in the future. Several clinical trials have revealed an association between IL28B genotype and treatment efficacy in triple therapy or IFN-free regimens. On the other hand the mechanism of the effect of IL28B on HCV infection has not yet been elucidated. Recently, it was shown that the polymorphism of IFN-lambda 4 (IFNL4) is in high linkage disequilibrium with that of near IL28B, and more strongly associated with spontaneous or treatment-induced HCV clearance than IL28B genotypes, especially in individuals of African ancestry. This finding provides new insights into the genetic regulation of HCV clearance and its clinical management. IL28B genotyping will be also useful for personalized CHC treatment in the forthcoming era of direct-acting antivirals. ? 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Direct-acting antiviral (DAA); Genome-wide association study (GWAS); Hepatitis C virus (HCV); Interleukin 28B (IL28B),"gamma interferon; interleukin 28B; peginterferon; ribavirin; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; IFNL4 protein, human; IL28B protein, human; interleukin derivative; macrogol derivative; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; recombinant protein; antiviral therapy; clinical trial (topic); disease course; DNA polymorphism; drug efficacy; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; hepatitis C; human; human genome project; innate immunity; liver carcinogenesis; liver fibrosis; mixed infection; personalized medicine; prediction; priority journal; protein function; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; treatment response; viral clearance; direct-acting antiviral (DAA); genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genetics; genome-wide association study (GWAS); Hepatitis C virus; hepatitis C virus (HCV); interleukin 28B (IL28B); review; treatment outcome; virology; direct-acting antiviral (DAA); genome-wide association study (GWAS); hepatitis C virus (HCV); interleukin 28B (IL28B); Antiviral Agents; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Individualized Medicine; Interferon-alpha; Interleukins; Polyethylene Glycols; Polymorphism, Genetic; Recombinant Proteins; Ribavirin; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84907284086

This study investigated whether the risk of death by both suicide and ECIs increases during the first year following the initial diagnosis of cancer. Methods: Data were analyzed from a population-based cohort of Japanese residents between 1990 and 2010, collected during the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study. Poisson regression models were used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (RRs) for both suicide and ECI deaths. To adjust for unmeasured confounding factors, case-crossover analyses were conducted for all patients with cancer who died by suicide and ECIs. Results: A population-based cohort of 102,843 Japanese residents was established. During the follow-up period, there were 34 suicides and 48 ECI deaths among patients with cancer, as compared with 527 suicides and 707 ECI deaths among those who did not have cancer. Analyses revealed that those who were newly diagnosed with cancer were at a greatly increased risk of death by suicide and ECIs within the first year after their diagnosis (suicide RR = 23.9, 95% CI: 13.8-41.6; ECI RR = 18.8, 95% CI: 11.4-31.0). Furthermore, the case-crossover analyses generally confirmed the results of the Poisson regressions. Conclusions: The risks of suicide and ECI deaths within the first year after a cancer diagnosis were higher than those among cancer-free populations. A diagnosis of cancer is a critical experience that may increase the risk of fatal outcomes.

Recently, activation of the c-MET/hepatocyte growth factor signaling pathway was associated with poor prognosis in various solid tumors and was one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, gefitinib. But the link between c-MET activation and the cytotoxic anticancer drug has not been fully examined. Here, we found that the enhanced expression and activation of c-MET in cytotoxic anticancer agent-resistant small-cell lung cancer cells. Downregulation of c-MET expression by siRNA against the c-MET gene or inhibition of c-MET activation by SU11274, a c-MET inhibitor, in the resistant cells altered resistance to the cytotoxic anticancer agent. These results indicated that c-MET overexpression might play an important role in acquired resistance to cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Furthermore, the number of c-MET gene loci was increased in the resistant cells compared to the parental cells. In conclusion, increased c-Met expression through an increase in the number of c-MET gene loci is one of the mechanisms of acquired resistance to cytotoxic anticancer drugs. Our results add a new strategy, the targeting of c-MET, for overcoming resistance to cytotoxic agents in small-cell lung cancer. Activation of c-MET signaling pathway through an increase in the number of c-MET gene loci is one of novel mechanisms contributing to acquired resistance to cytotoxic anticancer drugs. c-MET inhibitor may overcome the rapid development of drug resistance, which results in the poor prognosis of lung cancer patients. ? 2014 The Authors.

A total of 2,035 subjects (aged 35-69 years, 1,024 males and 1,011 females) enrolled in the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study. We examined the associations between near MC4R polymorphism (rs17782313) and obesity-related traits [height, weight, body mass index (BMI), weight change from 20 years old], serum lipid levels (triglycerides, total and HDL-cholesterol), and intake of nutrients (total energy and macronutrients). Polymorphism of rs17782313 (minor C allele) was positively associated with serum triglyceride levels (P for trend = 0.020) adjusted for age and sex. Analysis using a general linear model revealed that the number of minor C alleles was positively associated with serum triglyceride levels after adjustment for age, sex, and potential confounders (P for trend = 0.004). Statistical significance did not change after further adjustment for total energy intake and BMI. There was no significant association between rs17782313 and obesity-related traits including BMI. Interactions between rs17782313 and sex, BMI, or total energy intake for triglyceride levels were not significant.

In this report, we investigated the role of glutathione peroxidase 2 (GPX2) in CRPC. GPX2 expression was analyzed in rat and human CRPC cells. Next, we determined the proliferation rate and level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in GPX2-small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected CRPC cells. For in vivo analysis, siRNA-transfected cells were subcutaneously implanted into normal and castrated nude mice. Further, immunohistochemical and prognostic analyses of GPX2 were performed using human specimens. Silencing of GPX2 caused significant growth inhibition and increased intracellular ROS in both rat (PCai1) and human (PC3) CRPC cells. Flow cytometry and western blot analyses revealed that the decrease in proliferation rate of the GPX2-silenced cells was due to cyclin B1-dependent G2/M arrest. Furthermore, knockdown of Gpx2 inhibited tumor growth of PCai1 cells in castrated mice. Immunohistochemical analyses indicated that expression of GPX2 was significantly higher in residual cancer foci after neoadjuvant hormonal therapy than in hormone naive cancer foci. Moreover, patients with high GPX2 expression in biopsy specimen had significantly lower prostate-specific antigen recurrence-free survival and overall survival than those with no GPX2 expression. These findings suggest that GPX2 is a prognostic marker in CRPC and affects proliferation of prostate cancer under androgen depletion partially through protection against ROS signaling. ?

However, variations among clinical studies make it difficult to compare clinical outcomes. Here, we identified factors that determined the clinical benefits by analyzing data obtained at seven Japanese institutions that employed the same DC preparation and treatment regimens. Methods: Of 354 patients who met the inclusion criteria, 255 patients who received standard chemotherapy combined with peptide-pulsed DC vaccines were analyzed. Results: The mean survival time from diagnosis was 16.5 months (95 % CI 14.4-18.5) and that from the first vaccination was 9.9 months (95 % CI 8.0-12.9). Known prognostic baseline factors related to advanced pancreatic cancer, namely ECOG-PS, peritoneal metastasis, liver metastasis, and the prognostic nutrition index, were also representative. Importantly, we found that erythema reaction after vaccination was an independent and treatment-related prognostic factor for better survival and that OK-432 might be a good adjuvant enhancing the antitumor immunity during DC vaccination.

Methods: Core biopsy samples at baseline and post-treatment surgical samples were obtained from 80 and 77 of 116 patients, respectively, enrolled in the multicenter prospective study of neoadjuvant exemestane therapy (JFMC34-0601). The 21-gene assay was performed after appropriate manual microdissection. The estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, HER2 and Ki-67 were assayed by immunohistochemistry at a central laboratory. Clinical response was assessed based on the RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors) guideline. Results: Sixty-four core biopsy samples and 52 resection samples met the RS quality requirements. The clinical response rate in those patients with a low RS result (low RS group; 19/32, 59.4 %) was significantly higher than that in those patients with a high RS result (high RS group; 3/15, 20.0 %) (P = 0.015) and similar to that in patients with an intermediate RS result (intermediate RS group; 10/17, 58.8 %). The rates of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) were 90.6 % (29/32) in the low RS group, 76.5 % (13/17) in the intermediate RS group and 46.7 % (7/15) in the high RS group. The odds ratio for BCS adjusted for continuous baseline Ki-67 was 0.114 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.014-0.721; P = 0.028] between the high and low RS groups. RS values in pre-treatment samples were highly correlated with those in post-treatment samples (Spearman correlation coefficient 0.745, 95 % CI 0.592-0.846). Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the predictive value of the RS for clinical response to neoadjuvant exemestane therapy in postmenopausal women with ER-positive breast cancer. ? 2013 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Breast-conserving surgery rate; Clinical response; Ki-67; Neoadjuvant endocrine therapy; Recurrence Score,"epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor; exemestane; Ki 67 antigen; progesterone receptor; androstane derivative; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; estrogen receptor alpha; exemestane; Ki 67 antigen; progesterone receptor; tumor protein; adult; aged; article; assay; breast biopsy; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer hormone therapy; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; female; human; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; multicenter study; partial mastectomy; postmenopause; practice guideline; prediction; priority journal; prospective study; Recurrence Score assay; treatment duration; treatment response; biosynthesis; Breast Neoplasms; cancer staging; clinical trial; drug effects; gene expression regulation; genetics; middle aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; pathology; treatment outcome; Aged; Androstadienes; Breast Neoplasms; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Ki-67 Antigen; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Progesterone; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84906326666

In this article we present cases of low-grade osteosarcomas that should be reviewed by a clinical oncologist. Patients and methods: Nine cases of histologically diagnosed Broder grade 1 osteosarcoma were retrospectively reviewed. The pathological diagnoses included parosteal osteosarcoma, low-grade central osteosarcoma, and low-grade chondroblastic osteosarcoma in four, four, and one cases, respectively. Results: Duration from initial surgical intervention including biopsy to final diagnosis as low-grade osteosarcoma was a mean of 9.4 months. The initial benign diagnoses on biopsy specimens included fibrous dysplasia in three cases, chondroblastoma in one case, and a giant cell tumor in one case. The average number of histological examinations was 1.8. Low-grade osteosarcomas are well suited for biological reconstruction: seven cases were reconstructed by frozen autografts, distraction osteogenesis, or vascularized bone grafts. Conclusion: Low-grade osteosarcomas can be misdiagnosed as benign lesions, especially fibrous dysplasia. If the diagnosis of a low-grade osteosarcoma is not established on the basis of radiologic findings, care should be exercised, even when a biopsy suggests a benign lesion. Low-grade osteosarcomas should be treated with wide excision, even after an intralesional excision.

Normotensive individuals who visited our hospital for a yearly health checkup (n=8157, men=61.0% and age=50.7±12.2 years) were enrolled in the present study. After baseline evaluation, participants were followed up for a median of 48.3 months (range 4.9-101.0 months), with the endpoint being the development of hypertension, defined as systolic blood pressure (BP) ?140 mm Hg, diastolic BP ?90 mm Hg or the use of antihypertensive medication. The impact of uric acid and other cardiovascular risk factors at baseline on future BP and development of hypertension was assessed. During follow-up, 19.0% of women (n=605) and 29.5% of men (n=1 469) participants developed hypertension. Incident hypertension was increased across the quartiles for baseline uric acid levels (P<0.0001), and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis revealed a significant and independent association between the uric acid level and the onset of hypertension in both men and women participants (P<0.05). Furthermore, uric acid was independently and positively correlated with future BP (P<0.05). Thus, uric acid is an independent predictor of new-onset hypertension in both women and men. ? 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",BP; observational study; prediction; uric acid,uric acid; antihypertensive agent; biological marker; uric acid; adult; article; blood pressure; cardiovascular risk; cohort analysis; female; follow up; human; hypertension; hyperuricemia; incidence; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; outcome assessment; prospective study; systolic blood pressure; uric acid blood level; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; chi square distribution; drug effects; epidemiology; ethnology; hypertension; hyperuricemia; Japan; Kaplan Meier method; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; predictive value; proportional hazards model; risk assessment; risk factor; statistical model; time factor; upregulation; Adult; Antihypertensive Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biomarkers; Blood Pressure; Chi-Square Distribution; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Hyperuricemia; Incidence; Japan; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Predictive Value of Tests; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Up-Regulation; Uric Acid,2-s2.0-84906313323

The main action of 5-FU is the suppression of DNA replication by inhibiting Thymidylate Synthase (TS). Materials and Methods: We analyzed 5-FU resistance mechanisms using the head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines, UM-SCC-23, and two different resistant cell lines, UM-SCC-23/WR and UM-SCC-23/MR, which were procured from UM-SCC-23 cells. To acquire resistantance, the two cells underwent repeated treatment of 5-FU with different durations and frequency. We determined differences in the cell-cycle distribution and the expression of TS proteins in the three cell lines. Moreover, cell-cycle distribution in cells wich acquired resistance after 5-FU treatment, was compared to that of parental cells, using flow cytometric analysis. Results: There was a remarkable increase in TS protein expression levels in UM-SCC-23/WR following 5-FU treatment. S-phase cells of UM-SCC-23 and UM-SCC-23/WR cells were immediately increased after treatment with 5-FU, whereas UM-SCC-23/MR were accumulated to the S-phase slightly later. Conclusion: The cell-cycle perturbation or elevation of TS protein expression may be involved in acquired 5-FU resistance and identifies 5-FU resistance mechanisms in the two different 5-FU treatment regimens.",5-FU; Cell cycle; Head and neck carcinoma; Resistance; Thymidylate synthase,"fluorouracil; thymidylate synthase; antineoplastic antimetabolite; thymidylate synthase; Article; cancer resistance; carcinoma cell; cell cycle progression; cell cycle S phase; cell isolation; correlational study; DNA replication; drug exposure; enzyme inhibition; flow cytometry; head and neck carcinoma; human; human cell; protein expression; 5-FU; article; cell cycle; cell proliferation; drug effect; drug resistance; enzymology; head and neck carcinoma; head and neck tumor; metabolism; pathology; resistance; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell culture; Western blotting; 5-FU; cell cycle; head and neck carcinoma; resistance; thymidylate synthase; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Blotting, Western; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Flow Cytometry; Fluorouracil; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Thymidylate Synthase; Tumor Cells, Cultured",2-s2.0-84906312799

Methods: A total of 15 ureters from nine patients (age range 2-25 years) underwent robot-assisted laparoscopic extravesical ureteral reimplantation for the management of vesicoureteral reflux. The reflux was classified as grade I in one ureter, grade II in two ureters, grade III in seven ureters, grade IV in three ureters and grade V in two ureters. One of the five female patients had a bilateral duplex system, and reflux was observed in all four ureters. The da Vinci surgical system was utilized. Ureteral advancement was carried out in all cases. We also compared the operative outcomes between conventional laparoscopic procedure and robotic surgery. Results: The console time was 211.5 ± 87.4 min (median ± standard deviation) in the bilateral cases and 144.0 ± 40.8 min in the unilateral cases. Urethral catheters were removed at one or two postoperative days. None of the patients suffered postoperative complications, such as urine leakage or urinary retention. Postoperative voiding cystourethrography showed that the reflux had been resolved in 14 of the 15 ureters (success rate 93.3%). In the remaining case, the reflux grade decreased from III to I. The operative outcomes of robotic surgery were favorable and safe compared with conventional laparoscopic procedure.

Because early-stage SCLC is a rare presentation of lung cancer, studies comparing surgical resection among a large number of patients are unlikely to be conducted. This study reports the most recent surgical outcomes of a large number of SCLC patients who underwent surgery in 2004.Methods: In 2010, the Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry performed a nationwide retrospective registry study regarding the prognosis and clinicopathologic profiles of 11,663 patients who underwent resection for primary lung cancer in 2004. Of the 11,663 patients, 243 patients with SCLC (2.1%) were included in this study. The registry data of the patients with SCLC were analyzed, and the clinicopathologic profiles and surgical outcomes of the patients were evaluated.Results: The 5-year survival rate for all cases (n = 243, 213 males, mean age 68.2 years) was 52.6%. The 5-year survival rates by c-stage and p-stage were as follows: IA, 64.3% (n = 132) and 72.3% (n = 93); IB, 45.7% (n = 36) and 61.1% (n = 51); IIA, 50.5% (n =25); and 44.8% (n = 27); IIB, 33.3% (n = 10) and 40.3% (n = 17); IIIA, 30.5% (n = 30) and 23.4% (n = 45); and IV, 0% (n = 7) and 0% (n = 9), respectively. A multivariate analysis showed that the significant prognostic factors were age, gender, c-stage, and surgical curability. A kappa value was moderate conformity between c-stage and p-stage in all cases.Conclusions: Surgical resection in selected patients with early-stage SCLC, especially stage I, had favorable results.

We have previously reported that prostaglandin D2 (PGD2) stimulates heat shock protein 27 (HSP27) induction via activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, p38 MAP kinase and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK) in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism behind the effect of PGD2 on osteoprotegerin (OPG) synthesis and the effect of resveratrol on the OPG synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells. PGD2 significantly stimulated both the OPG release and the expression levels of OPG mRNA. Resveratrol and SRT1720, an activator of SIRT1, markedly suppressed the PGD2-induced OPG release and the mRNA levels of OPG. PD98059, a specific MEK inhibitor, SB203580, a specific p38 MAP kinase inhibitor, and SP600125, a specific SAPK/JNK inhibitor suppressed the PGD2-stimulated OPG release. PGD2-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK was attenuated by resveratrol or SRT1720. However, resveratrol or SRT1720 failed to affect the phosphorylation of myosin phosphatase-targeting subunit-1 (MYPT-1), a downstream substrate of Rho-kinase and p44/p42 MAP kinase. These results strongly suggest that resveratrol suppresses PGD2-stimulated OPG synthesis through inhibiting p38 MAP kinase and SAPK/JNK in osteoblasts, and that the suppressive effect is exerted at the point downstream of Rho-kinase but upstream of p38 MAP kinase or SAPK/JNK. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Osteoblast; Osteoprotegerin; Resveratrol,"2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone; 4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 methylsulfinylphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl)imidazole; anthra[1,9 cd]pyrazol 6(2h) one; enzyme activator; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; myosin light chain phosphatase; osteoprotegerin; prostaglandin D2; resveratrol; srt 1720; stress activated protein kinase; unclassified drug; enzyme inhibitor; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; osteoprotegerin; prostaglandin D2; resveratrol; Sirt1 protein, mouse; sirtuin 1; stilbene derivative; Tnfrsf11b protein, mouse; animal cell; article; bone metabolism; controlled study; enzyme phosphorylation; fatty acid analysis; gene expression; metabolic regulation; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; osteoblast; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein lipid interaction; protein secretion; protein synthesis inhibition; signal transduction; animal; biosynthesis; cell line; cytology; drug effects; human; metabolism; osteoblast; Vitaceae; Animals; Cell Line; Enzyme Inhibitors; Extracellular Signal-Regulated MAP Kinases; Humans; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Osteoblasts; Osteoprotegerin; Prostaglandin D2; RNA, Messenger; Sirtuin 1; Stilbenes",2-s2.0-84905573471

The purpose of this study was to examine whether stroke increases the risks of suicide and ECI deaths. METHODS: We analyzed data from the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study between 1990 and 2010. Poisson regression models were used to calculate adjusted risk ratios (RR) for suicide and ECI deaths. To adjust for unmeasured confounders, case-crossover analyses of all stroke patients who died by suicide and ECIs were also performed. RESULTS: A population-based cohort of 93,027 Japanese residents was established. During the follow-up period, 4793 residents had been diagnosed as having stroke. During this period, there were 22 suicides and 53 ECI deaths among stroke patients and 490 suicides and 675 ECI deaths among those who were stroke-free. Stroke patients were at increased risk for death by suicide and ECIs within the first 5 years after a stroke (suicide: RR = 10.2, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 6.3-16.6; ECI: RR = 12.8, 95% confidence interval = 9.0-18.2). Furthermore, case-crossover analyses confirmed the results of the Poisson regression models. CONCLUSIONS: The RRs of suicide and ECI deaths within the first 5 years after a stroke were noticeably high. These findings underscore the need for clinicians and health care professionals to be aware of causes of death after a stroke and closely monitor patients during the first few poststroke years.

The present study aimed to evaluate the anti-allergic effect of byakkokakeishito extract (BKT), which consists of gypsum (natural hydrous calcium sulfate), Anemarrhena Rhizome (rhizome of Anemarrhena asphodeloides), Cinnamon Bark (bark of trunk of Cinnamomum cassia), Oriza Seed (seed of Oryza sativa), and Glycyrrhiza (root and stolon of Glycyrrhiza uralensis), and to clarify the role of gypsum in the formula. We prepared BKT by boiling a mixture of various quantities of gypsum and fixed amounts of the other four crude drugs in water. We evaluated the anti-allergic activity of the formulations using three different murine models of allergy: contact dermatitis induced by painting hapten onto skin; allergic dermatitis-like symptoms induced by cutaneous injection of mite-antigen; and skin passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) reaction using ovalbumin as antigen. The calcium content in the various BKT samples was dose-dependently increased up to 60 g/day of human dosage. BKT significantly suppressed the allergic symptoms in the three different experimental models. The effect of BKT was augmented by increasing the gypsum dosage only in the PCA reaction model. The extract prepared from a mixture of Anemarrhena Rhizome and gypsum exhibited an effect comparable to that of BKT. BKT exhibits an anti-allergic effect in several animal models, which may provide experimental evidence for the clinical use of BKT in allergic diseases. Gypsum may augment the anti-allergic activity of BKT, presumably through increasing intestinal absorption of Anemarrhena Rhizome-derived active constituents. ? 2014 The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer.",Allergic diseases; Anemarrhena rhizome; Calcium; Gypsum; Kampo medicine,"antiallergic agent; byakkokakeishito; calcium sulfate; hapten; herbaceous agent; ovalbumin; unclassified drug; Anemarrhena asphodeloides; animal experiment; animal model; article; Cinnamomum cassia; contact dermatitis; controlled study; dose response; Glycyrrhiza uralensis; male; mouse; nonhuman; passive skin anaphylaxis; rhizome; rice; skin allergy; Anemarrhena; Animals; Anti-Allergic Agents; Calcium Sulfate; Dermatitis, Atopic; Dermatitis, Contact; Female; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Passive Cutaneous Anaphylaxis; Plant Extracts; Rhizome",2-s2.0-84904695431

The latest version of the planning software is equipped with a convolution dose algorithm as an optional extra and the new algorithm is able to compensate for head inhomogeneity. However, the effect of this improved calculation method requires detailed validation in clinical cases. In this study, we compared absolute and relative dose distributions of treatment plans for acoustic neurinoma between TMR and the convolution calculation. Methods: Twenty-nine clinically used plans created by TMR algorithm were recalculated by convolution method. Differences between TMR and convolution were evaluated in terms of absolute dose (beam-on time), dosimetric parameters including target coverage, selectivity, conformity index, gradient index, radical homogeneity index and the dose-volume relationship. Results: The discrepancy in estimated absolute dose to the target ranged from 1 to 7 % between TMR and convolution. In addition, dosimetric parameters of the two methods achieved statistical significance. However, it was difficult to see the change of relative dose distribution by visual assessment on a monitor. Conclusions: Convolution, heterogeneity correction calculation, and the algorithm are necessary to reduce the dosimetric uncertainty of each case in GK SRS. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag.",Convolution algorithm; Dose calculation; Gamma knife; Stereotactic radiosurgery; Tissue maximum ratio algorithm,"acoustic neurinoma; algorithm; article; calculation; clinical article; comparative study; computed tomography scanner; conformity index; contrast enhancement; controlled study; dose volume relationship; dosimetry; gamma knife; gamma knife radiosurgery; health care; human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; radiation dose distribution; radical homogeneity index; radiological parameters; radiotherapy software; stereotactic device; target coverage; tissue maximum ratio; treatment duration; treatment planning; algorithm; computer assisted radiotherapy; devices; Monte Carlo method; Neuroma, Acoustic; procedures; radiation dose; radiosurgery; Algorithms; Humans; Monte Carlo Method; Neuroma, Acoustic; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted",2-s2.0-84904426712

Previously we showed that MWCNT translocated from the lung alveoli into the pleural cavity and caused mesothelial proliferation and fibrosis in the visceral pleura. Multiwalled carbon nanotubes were not found in the parietal pleura, the initial site of development of asbestos-caused pleural diseases in humans, probably due to the short exposure period of the study. In the present study, we extended the exposure period to 24 weeks to determine whether the size and shape of MWCNT impact on deposition and lesion development in the pleura and lung. Two different MWCNTs were chosen for this study: a larger sized needle-like MWCNT (MWCNT-L; l = 8 μm, d = 150 nm), and a smaller sized MWCNT (MWCNT-S; l = 3 μm, d = 15 nm), which forms cotton candy-like aggregates. Both MWCNT-L and MWCNT-S suspensions were administered to the rat lung once every 2 weeks for 24 weeks by transtracheal intrapulmonary spraying. It was found that MWCNT-L, but not MWCNT-S, translocated into the pleural cavity, deposited in the parietal pleura, and induced fibrosis and patchy parietal mesothelial proliferation lesions. In addition, MWCNT-L induced stronger inflammatory reactions including increased inflammatory cell number and cytokine/chemokine levels in the pleural cavity lavage than MWCNT-S. In contrast, MWCNT-S induced stronger inflammation and higher 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine level in the lung tissue than MWCNT-L. These results suggest that MWCNT-L has higher risk of causing asbestos-like pleural lesions relevant to mesothelioma development. The larger, needle-like MWCNT-L translocated into the pleural cavity, deposited in the parietal pleura, and induced fibrosis and mesothelial proliferation and caused stronger inflammation. In the lung, the smaller MWCNT-S caused stronger inflammation and higher production of 8-OHdG. MWCNT showed size- and shape-dependent toxic effects in the pleura and lung. Deposition of MWCNT-L and induction of fibrosis and mesothelial cell proliferation in the parietal pleura indicate that lager sized MWCNT has greater potential to induce asbestos-like pleural lesions. ? 2014 The Authors.

Department of Environmental and Molecular Medicine, Mie University Graduate School of Medicine-Objectives: Asbestos causes lung cancer and malignant mesothelioma, and chronic inflammation is considered to participate in carcinogenesis. However, biomarkers to evaluate its carcinogenic risk have not been established. Reactive oxygen/nitrogen species are generated in biological systems under inflammatory conditions and may contribute to carcinogenesis by causing DNA damage. In this study, we examined the relationship between the formation of 8-nitroguanine (8-nitroG), a mutagenic DNA lesion formed during inflammation, and asbestos contents in human lung tissues. Methods: We obtained non-tumor lung tissues from patients with (n=15) and without mesothelioma (n=21). The expression of 8-nitroG and related molecules was examined by immunohistochemistry, and their staining intensities were semiquantitatively evaluated. Asbestos contents in lung tissues were analyzed by analytical transmission electron microscopy. Results: In subjects without mesothelioma, staining intensities of 8-nitroG and apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) were significantly correlated with total asbestos and amphibole contents (p<0.05), but not with chrysotile content. In mesothelioma patients 2014their staining intensities were not correlated with asbestos contents. The double immunofluorescence technique revealed that APE1 was expressed in 8-nitroG-positive cells, suggesting that abasic sites were formed possibly due to the removal of 8-nitroG. The staining intensities of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydro-2'-deoxyguanosine, an oxidative DNA lesion, and its repair enzyme 8-oxoguanine DNA-glycosylase were correlated with age (p<0.05), but not with asbestos contents in subjects without mesothelioma. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that 8-nitroG formation is associated with asbestos contents in human lung tissues. This finding raises a possibility that 8-nitroG serves as a biomarker that can be used to evaluate asbestos exposure and carcinogenic risk.",8-Nitroguanine; Asbestos; Carcinogenesis; DNA damage; Lung; Reactive nitrogen species,8-nitroguanine; asbestos; biological marker; carcinogen; guanine; aged; analogs and derivatives; carcinogenesis; chemistry; DNA damage; female; human; lung; lung tumor; male; mesothelioma; metabolism; middle aged; occupational exposure; pathology; pilot study; staining; Aged; Asbestos; Biological Markers; Carcinogenesis; Carcinogens; DNA Damage; Female; Guanine; Humans; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mesothelioma; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Pilot Projects; Staining and Labeling,2-s2.0-84903825894

Methods: We retrospectively compared 45 patients who underwent pancreatic stenting prior to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (stenting group) and 35 patients who did not undergo stenting prior to extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (non-stenting group) with regard to the cumulative number of shock waves required for stone fragmentation (stone size <3. mm) and the rate of complications.

In established examples of viral carcinogenesis, viral DNA and one or more of its products have been detected in most tumor cells of biopsies in the majority of cases. To test whether HCMV is associated with human glioblastoma based on this criterion, we measured the number of viral DNA molecules per cell in both frozen and paraffin-embedded tumor biopsies from 58 patients using real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR). Immunohistochemical and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to detect HCMV proteins and genome was performed in 10 cases using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded glioblastoma tissues. Southern blotting using DNA extracted from four glioblastoma cell lines together with immunoblotting using the four cell lines and five glioblastoma tissue samples were also performed. We further confirmed the immunoblot bands using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry assay. As a result, HCMV DNA was not detected in the tumor cells from any of the glioblastoma cases by QPCR detecting two different HCMV genes, in clear contrast to samples from patients with HCMV infection. Southern blotting and immunoblotting of cell lines and FISH using paraffin sections were all negative. However, immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry using tissue samples were partly positive, but HCMV proteins were not detected by proteomic analysis, suggesting false positivity of the analyses. As our QPCR analysis could detect 10 copies of HCMV DNA mixed with DNA extracted from 10 4 HCMV-negative cells, we conclude that HCMV is not persistent, at least in the tumor cells, of developed human glioblastoma. ? 2014 USCAP, Inc All rights reserved.",glioblastoma; glycoprotein B; human cytomegalovirus; immediate early gene; liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry; real-time quantitative PCR,"virus DNA; virus protein; virus DNA; adolescent; adult; aged; article; cancer patient; cancer tissue; child; DNA extraction; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; glioblastoma; glioblastoma cell line; human; human cell; Human cytomegalovirus; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; liquid chromatography; male; priority journal; proteomics; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; Southern blotting; tandem mass spectrometry; tumor biopsy; virus carcinogenesis; virus genome; brain tumor; Cytomegalovirus; glioblastoma; isolation and purification; middle aged; pathology; very elderly; virology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Neoplasms; Child; Cytomegalovirus; DNA, Viral; Female; Glioblastoma; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Male; Middle Aged; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction",2-s2.0-84903789016

Methods: We analyzed 114 tumor tissues from ovarian tumors, including 44 adult-type and two juvenile-type GCT of the ovary and 68 ovarian tumors by DNA sequencing. Immunohistochemistry was also performed in the adult and juvenile GCT tissues by immunostaining inhibin-a, BMP2 and FST. Results: We found the FOXL2 p.C134W mutation in 27 out of 44 (61.4%) adult-type GCT of the ovary, but none in other ovarian tumors. Histologically, all of the adult-type GCT sections were positive for inhibin-a, and the expression of BMP2 and FST was detected in 14 of 44 (31.8%) and zero of 47 (0%), respectively. No significant differences regarding the diagnosed age, preoperative serum carbohydrate antigen 125 levels, or BMP2 immunopositivity between the FOXL2 p.C134W mutation-positive and mutation-negative were found in the adult-type GCT patients.

Many researchers have now revised this definition to two or more pregnancy losses because of the recent increase in the prevalence of childless couples. Established causes of recurrent miscarriage are antiphospholipid antibodies, uterine anomalies and abnormal chromosomes in either partner, particularly translocations. Antiphospholipid syndrome is the most important treatable cause of recurrent miscarriage. However, it is not yet established as to what kind of testing should be conducted in patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. Standardization of tests for antiphospholipid antibodies is needed. On the other hand, embryonic aneuploidy is the most frequent cause of recurrent miscarriage. Chromosome analysis of the embryo is important, because it has good predictive value for subsequent live birth. It is not necessary to give any medications for unexplained cases of recurrent miscarriage, and provision of psychological support may be the most important to encourage the couples to continue to conceive until a live birth results. ? 2014 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.",Antiphospholipid antibodies; Embryonic karyotype; Recurrent miscarriage; Translocation; Uterine anomalies,"acetylsalicylic acid; heparin; phospholipid antibody; phospholipid antibody; adult; antiphospholipid syndrome; article; chromosome aberration; chromosome analysis; chromosome translocation; diabetes mellitus; female; human; hypothyroidism; karyotype; live birth; low drug dose; major clinical study; pregnant woman; recurrent abortion; spontaneous abortion; uterus malformation; aneuploidy; antiphospholipid syndrome; Article; conception; congenital malformation; embryonic aneuploidy; fertilization in vitro; fetus death; gestational age; immunization; intrauterine growth retardation; oocyte retrieval; preeclampsia; pregnancy; psychological aspect; recurrent miscarriage; social support; uterus malformation; Abortion, Habitual; complication; uterus; Abnormal Karyotype; Abortion, Habitual; Adult; Antiphospholipid Syndrome; Chromosome Aberrations; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Uterus",2-s2.0-84903577416

Median patient's age was 76 years and median follow-up period for living patients was 20 months (range, 6-46).

Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 somatic mutations have been reported in patients without human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 gene amplification. Since these are activating mutations, these patients may also benefit from human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-targeted drugs. Methods: In this study, we searched for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 mutations in a group of 286 Japanese breast cancer patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative tumors. The activating mutations of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 identified were analyzed by direct Sanger sequencing of two major areas: the extracellular domain at 309-310 and the kinase domain between 755 and 781. Results: Two tumors were found to have a human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 somatic mutation; one with I767M mutation and another with D769Y. No mutation was observed in the extracellular domain. One of these patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 mutation recurred early with liver metastasis. Conclusions: Better knowledge of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 mutation status will help us to choose personalized molecular targeted therapy for use in human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative Japanese breast cancer patients. ?

Methods: From June 2006 to January 2012, 38 patients with metastatic UC previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy received GD therapy. This consisted of gemcitabine 800 mg/m 2 and docetaxel 40 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle as second-line chemotherapy. All the patients were evaluated for toxicity and assessed every cycle by imaging. We analyzed the efficacy of GD as second-line chemotherapy in the follow-up study. Results: The median number of GD treatment cycles was 4 (range 2-9); the objective response rate was 47.4 %; and the median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 4.1 and 10.8 months, respectively. Univariate and multivariate analyses on the GD treated group showed that the existence of lung metastases was the only prognostic factor for tumor response. Grade 3 treatment-related toxicity included neutropenia (31.6 %) and thrombocytopenia (15.8 %), and only one patient with grade 4 toxicity had thrombocytopenia (2.6 %). Conclusions: The GD regimen as second-line chemotherapy was especially effective for lung metastatic UC and yielded favorable results in patients whose first-line platinum-based chemotherapy had failed. Given the safety and benefit profile seen in this study, a large prospective study is warranted to consider the potential utility of GD chemotherapy as a second-line for UC. ? 2013 Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Metastasis; Second-line chemotherapy; Urothelial carcinoma,"cisplatin; dexamethasone; docetaxel; doxorubicin; epirubicin; gemcitabine; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; methotrexate; vinblastine; antineoplastic agent; deoxycytidine; docetaxel; gemcitabine; taxoid; adult; alopecia; article; bone marrow suppression; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer survival; chemotherapy induced anemia; chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting; clinical article; drug efficacy; drug screening; febrile neutropenia; female; follow up; human; human tissue; liver dysfunction; lung metastasis; male; multiple cycle treatment; neutropenia; overall survival; physical examination; priority journal; progression free survival; prospective study; sex difference; survival rate; thrombocyte transfusion; thrombocytopenia; transitional cell carcinoma; treatment response; aged; analogs and derivatives; chemically induced; clinical trial; Lung Neoplasms; middle aged; mortality; multivariate analysis; neutropenia; pathology; secondary; thrombocytopenia; treatment outcome; Urologic Neoplasms; urothelium; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Deoxycytidine; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neutropenia; Taxoids; Thrombocytopenia; Treatment Outcome; Urologic Neoplasms; Urothelium; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84903316928

This study aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of rikkunshito for treating functional dyspepsia (FD). Methods: FD patients received 2.5 g rikkunshito or placebo three times a day for 8 weeks in this multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial. The primary end point was the proportion of responders at 8 weeks after starting test drug, determined by global patient assessment (GPA). The improvement in four major dyspepsia symptoms severity scale was also evaluated. In addition, plasma ghrelin levels were investigated before and after treatment. Key Results: Two hundred forty-seven patients were randomly assigned. In the eighth week, the rikkunshito group had more GPA responders (33.6%) than the placebo (23.8%), although this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.09). Epigastric pain was significantly improved (p = 0.04) and postprandial fullness tended to improve (p = 0.06) in the rikkunshito group at week 8. Rikkunshito was relatively more effective among Helicobacter pylori-infected participants (rikkunshito: 40.0% vs placebo: 20.5%, p = 0.07), and seemed less effective among H. pylori-uninfected participants (rikkunshito: 29.3% vs placebo: 25.6%, p = 0.72). Among H. pylori-positive individuals, acyl ghrelin levels were improved just in rikkunshito group. There were no severe adverse events in both groups.

Methods Functional data analysis and model-based clustering methods were used to identify nocturnal HR patterns in 245 depressed and 247 nondepressed patients with a recent MI. All-cause mortality and recurrent infarctions were ascertained over a median follow-up of 24 months. Results Three HR activity patterns were identified. In the first, HR gradually declined during the nighttime and increased the next morning. The second pattern was similar, but with a higher overall HR during the recording interval. The third showed almost no decrease in HR at night (ie, ""nondipping""). All-cause mortality was higher among patients with pattern 3 than pattern 1 (P =.007), and the combined end point of recurrent MI or all-cause mortality was higher in pattern 3 than pattern 2 (P =.05). Patterns 2 and 3 were more common in the depressed than in the nondepressed patients. Conclusions The nondipping nocturnal HR independently predicts all-cause mortality and recurrent MI. Future studies should examine the underlying causes of nondipping nocturnal HR and its association with depression and investigate the effects of treatment on survival. ? 2014 Mosby, Inc.",,"acute heart infarction; adult; article; controlled study; depression; female; heart rate; human; major clinical study; male; mortality; night; priority journal; recurrent disease; risk assessment; survival; Circadian Rhythm; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Myocardial Infarction; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Survival Rate; Time Factors; United States",2-s2.0-84903147868

Results: Genotypes CC/CT/TT of rs12979860 were found in 42 (35.3%), 56 (47.1%) and 21 (17.6%) and rs8099917 TT/TG/GG were found in 74 (62.2%), 40 (33.6%) and 5 (4.2%). In carriers of rs12979860 CC and rs8099917 TT, the rate of SVR was 87.5 and 65.7% respectively. In 54 patients heterozygous for the C allele of rs12979860, testing of rs8099917 revealed SVR in 42.3% of carriers of the TT genotype but no such responses in carriers of TG or GG (P < 0.0001, OR = 47.3, 95% CI: 2.33-767.2). By multivariate analysis, predictors of SVR were baseline ALT (P = 0.014, OR = 6.3, 95% CI: 1.45-27.33), rs12979860 CC (P = 0.001, OR = 13.48, 95% CI: 2.95-61.69) and rs8099917 TT (P = 0.027, OR = 7.5, 95% CI: 1.25-44.88). Conclusion: In CHC genotype 4 patients, favourable genotypes of both SNPs of IL28B are valuable for predicting SVR. Additional genotyping of rs8099917 in carriers of the heterozygous C allele of rs12979860 can improve the prediction of SVR. ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Indications for steroid therapy in AIP patients are symptoms such as obstructive jaundice, abdominal pain, back pain, and the presence of symptomatic extrapancreatic lesions. Prior to steroid therapy, obstructive jaundice should be managed by biliary drainage, and blood glucose levels should be controlled in patients with diabetes mellitus. The recommended initial oral prednisolone dose for induction of remission is 0.6 mg/kg/day, which is administered for 2-4 weeks. The dose is then tapered by 5 mg every 1-2 weeks, based on changes in clinical manifestations, biochemical blood tests (such as liver enzymes and IgG or IgG4 levels), and repeated imaging findings (US, CT, MRCP, ERCP, etc.). The dose is tapered to a maintenance dose (2.5-5 mg/day) over a period of 2-3 months. Cessation of steroid therapy should be based on the disease activity in each case. Termination of maintenance therapy should be planned within 3 years in cases with radiological and serological improvement. Re-administration or dose-up of steroid is effective for treating AIP relapse. Application of immunomodulatory drugs is considered for AIP patients who prove resistant to steroid therapy. The prognosis of AIP appears to be good over the short-term with steroid therapy. The long-term outcome is less clear, as there are many unknown factors, such as relapse, pancreatic exocrine or endocrine dysfunction, and associated malignancy. ? 2014 Springer.",Autoimmune pancreatitis; Guideline; Steroid; Treatment,azathioprine; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin G4; liver enzyme; mercaptopurine; methotrexate; methylprednisolone; mycophenolic acid 2 morpholinoethyl ester; prednisolone; rituximab; steroid; glucocorticoid; abdominal pain; article; autoimmune pancreatitis; backache; biliary tract drainage; blood examination; computer assisted tomography; conservative treatment; diabetes mellitus; disease activity; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; endocrine function; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; glucose blood level; human; Japanese (people); low drug dose; maintenance therapy; multiple cycle treatment; obstructive jaundice; pancreas cancer; priority journal; prognosis; recommended drug dose; relapse; steroid therapy; treatment duration; treatment indication; ultrasound; Asian continental ancestry group; Autoimmune Diseases; consensus; immunology; pancreatitis; practice guideline; prognosis; recurrent disease; treatment outcome; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Autoimmune Diseases; Consensus; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Pancreatitis; Prognosis; Recurrence; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84902360124

However, most mouse models are based on the previous prevailing view that ovarian cancer develops from the transformation of the ovarian surface epithelium. Here, we report the extensive histological and molecular characterization of the mogp-TAg transgenic mouse, which expresses the SV40 large T-antigen (TAg) under the control of the mouse m?llerian-specific Ovgp-1 promoter. Histological analysis of the fallopian tubes of mogp-TAg mice identified a variety of neoplastic lesions analogous to those described as precursors to ovarian HGSC. We identified areas of normal-appearing p53-positive epithelium that are similar to 'p53 signatures' in the human fallopian tube. More advanced proliferative lesions with nuclear atypia and epithelial stratification were also identified that were morphologically and immunohistochemically reminiscent of human serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC), a potential precursor of ovarian HGSC. Beside these non-invasive precursor lesions, we also identified invasive adenocarcinoma in the ovaries of 56% of the mice. Microarray analysis revealed several genes differentially expressed between the fallopian tube of mogp-TAg and wild-type (WT) C57BL/6. One of these genes, Top2a, which encodes topoisomerase IIα, was shown by immunohistochemistry to be concurrently expressed with elevated p53 and was specifically elevated in mouse STICs but not in the surrounding tissues. TOP2A protein was also found elevated in human STICs, low-grade and high-grade serous carcinoma. The mouse model reported here displays a progression from normal tubal epithelium to invasive HGSC in the ovary, and therefore closely simulates the current emerging model of human ovarian HGSC pathogenesis. This mouse therefore has the potential to be a very useful new model for elucidating the mechanisms of serous ovarian tumourigenesis, as well as for developing novel approaches for the prevention, diagnosis and therapy of this disease.

However, the treatment efficacy of ITPA genetic variants has not been fully explored. We enrolled 309 individuals infected with hepatitis C virus genotype 1, who were treated with PEG-IFN plus RBV for 48 weeks. The ITPA SNP: rs1127354 and IL28B SNP: rs8099917 were genotyped. We examined the risk factors for severe anaemia up to week 12 after the start of treatment and treatment efficacy. The incidence of severe anaemia, ?3 g/dL reduction or <10 g/dL of haemoglobin (Hb) up to week 12, was more frequent in patients with CC at rs1127354 [65% (145/224), 33% (73/224)] than in those with CA/AA [25% (21/85), 6% (8/85)] (P < 0.0001). ITPA genotype, pretreatment Hb level and age were independent predictive factors for severe anaemia: Hb < 10 g/dL. In IL28B favourable type, the sustained virologic response rate was higher in ?60-year-old patients with CA/AA than in those with CC [71% (22/31) vs 40% (26/65), P = 0.005], although there was no significant difference in treatment efficacy according to ITPA genetic variants in the <60-year-old patients. The proportion of patients administered ?80% of the dosage of RBV was significantly higher in the patients with CA/AA than in those with CC (P = 0.025), resulting in a lower relapse rate. In conclusion, ITPA genetic variants were associated with severe RBV-induced anaemia and could influence the efficacy of PEG-IFN plus RBV treatment among elderly patients with IL28B favourable type. ? 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",anaemia; IL28B; interferon; ITPA; ribavirin,"hemoglobin; inosine triphosphatase; inosine triphosphate; interleukin 28B; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; ribavirin; unclassified drug; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; IL28B protein, human; inorganic pyrophosphatase; interleukin derivative; ITPA protein, human; ribavirin; virus RNA; age; age distribution; aged; anemia; article; disease severity; drug efficacy; female; genetic variability; geriatric patient; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; human; major clinical study; male; microbiological parameters; priority journal; recurrence risk; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; sustained virologic response; treatment outcome; adult; anemia; blood; chemically induced; classification; genetics; genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; isolation and purification; middle aged; recurrent disease; virology; virus load; Adult; Aged; Anemia; Antiviral Agents; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Interleukins; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Pyrophosphatases; Recurrence; Ribavirin; RNA, Viral; Treatment Outcome; Viral Load",2-s2.0-84902295031

However, it is unclear whether any risk factors modulate the effects of the standard-dose carvedilol. Methods and results: Data from 245 patients with HFPEF in J-DHF were evaluated. Decreased body mass index, diabetes mellitus, and left atrial (LA) dilatation were independent risk factors for both of the primary outcomes (cardiovascular death and unplanned hospitalization for heart failure) and another major composite outcome (cardiovascular death and unplanned hospitalization for any cardiovascular causes) in multivariable analysis. In patients with LA diameter ? the median value (43.2 mm), standard-dose carvedilol was associated with unadjusted hazard ratio (HR) 0.263 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.080-0.859] and covariate adjusted 0.264 (0.080-0.876) for the primary outcome. In those with LA diameter < 43.2 mm, unadjusted and adjusted HRs were 1.123 (0.501-2.514) and 1.067 (0.472-2.412). A p-value for interaction was 0.046 (unadjusted) and 0.058 (adjusted). The similar effects of LA diameter were observed regarding another major composite outcome. The other risk factors in univariate or multivariable analyses did not influence the response to the standard-dose carvedilol. Conclusions: The standard-dose carvedilol may exert greater reduction of the incidence of clinical outcomes in the patients with HFPEF and advanced rather than mild diastolic dysfunction. ? 2013 Japanese College of Cardiology.",Diastole; Heart failure; Left atrium; β-Blocker,"carvedilol; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; carbazole derivative; carvedilol; propanolamine derivative; aged; article; body mass; cardiovascular mortality; clinical evaluation; clinical study; confidence interval; controlled study; correlation analysis; diabetes mellitus; dose response; drug effect; drug response; female; hazard ratio; heart atrium enlargement; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; heart left atrium; hospitalization; human; Japan; major clinical study; male; multivariate analysis; prognosis; risk factor; statistical significance; treatment outcome; univariate analysis; heart atrium; Heart Failure, Diastolic; heart stroke volume; lesions and defects; middle aged; multicenter study (topic); pathology; pathophysiology; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic); very elderly; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Body Mass Index; Carbazoles; Diabetes Mellitus; Dilatation, Pathologic; Female; Heart Atria; Heart Failure, Diastolic; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Propanolamines; Prospective Studies; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Factors; Stroke Volume; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84902199357

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and safety of robotic-assisted rectal cancer resection in terms of short-term and midterm outcomes. DESIGN: A prospectively collected set of samples was retrospectively evaluated. SETTINGS: Data included in this study were collected at a single institution from 2007 to 2011. PATIENTS: The study included 200 consecutive rectal cancer patients. INTERVENTION: The patients underwent robotic-assisted resection surgery performed by a single surgeon. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The short-term (surgical outcome and pathologic data) and midterm outcomes (local pelvic control and overall and disease-free survival) were evaluated and compared with those in the published literature. RESULTS: The median patient age was 60 years, and the male:female ratio was 2:1. The median distance of rectal tumors from the anal verge was 6 cm. Preoperative radiotherapy was performed in 55 patients. The median operation time was 270 minutes, and the median blood loss was 190 mL. Grade 3 to 5 complications, according to the Clavien-Dindo classification, were observed in 15 patients (7.5%). The circumferential resection margin was positive in 5 patients (2.5%). During the median follow-up period of 29.8 months, recurrence occurred in 27 patients (distant metastasis, 18 patients; local recurrence, 7 patients; and both local recurrence and distant metastases, 2 patients). The local pelvic control and overall and disease-free survival rates of stage III patients at 5 years were 93.0%, 88.6%, and 76.6%. LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective, uncontrolled study of selected patients by a single surgeon. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrated an acceptable morbidity and a low rate of positive circumferential resection margin with effective local control. We also achieved excellent survival data.

Makino T.,7402183192;,3-Monoglucuronyl glycyrrhretinic acid is a possible marker compound related to licorice-induced pseudoaldosteronism,2014,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84901837251&doi=10.1248%2fbpb.b13-00997&partnerID=40&md5=233b0fc5a8e8a8092825f28d3f258a75,"One of the most common adverse effects of traditional Japanese kampo and traditional Chinese medicine is pseudoaldosteronism caused by licorice. In this review, the authors describe the mechanisms of licorice-induced pseudoaldosteronism by the pharmacokinetics of chemical constituents and its metabolites containing licorice. Glycyrrhizin (GL), the main constituent of licorice, is absorbed as glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), which is a metabolite of GL produced by enterobacteria before its release into the circulation. Circulating GA is metabolized in the liver to become 3-monoglucuronyl-glycyrrhetinic acid (3MGA), which is excreted into the bile via multidrug resistance protein 2 (Mrp2). If Mrp2 function is damaged for some reason, 3MGA is secreted from the liver into the circulation, and excreted into the urine via organic anion transporters expressed at the basolateral side of tubular epithelial cells. Circulating GA cannot be excreted into the urine since GA binds highly to serum albumin and thus does not pass through glomerular filtration and is not a substrate of transporters expressed on tubular epithelial cells. Licorice-induced pseudoaldosteronism develops due to the inhibition of type 2 11β-hydrosteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD2) which results in the accumulation of cortisol in tubular epithelial cells that activate mineral corticoid receptors to stimulate the excretion of potassium that results in hypokalemia. GA, unlike 3MGA, cannot pass through tubular epithelial cells and cannot inhibit the enzyme in the cells. Therefore, 3MGA may be a genuine causative agent for licorice-induced pseudoaldosteronism. When licorice is used, 3MGA in plasma or urine could function as a marker compound to prevent the adverse effects. ? 2014 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",3-Monoglucuronyl-glycyrrhetinic acid; Licorice; Organic anion transporter; Pseudoaldosteronism,"11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; 3 monoglucuronyl glycyrrhretinic acid; albumin; glycyrrhetinic acid; glycyrrhizic acid; hydrocortisone; mineralocorticoid receptor; multidrug resistance protein 2; organic anion transporter; potassium; unclassified drug; 11beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2; biological marker; glycyrrhetinic acid; glycyrrhetyl 3-monoglucuronide; multidrug resistance protein; P-glycoprotein 2; albumin blood level; Chinese medicine; drug absorption; drug binding; drug blood level; drug elimination; drug excretion; drug metabolism; drug receptor binding; drug structure; drug urine level; Enterobacteriaceae; epithelium cell; glomerulus filtration; Glycyrrhiza; human; hyperaldosteronism; hypokalemia; licorice induced pseudoaldosteronism; metabolite; potassium excretion; protein function; review; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; bile; blood; chemically induced; drug effects; enzymology; genetics; kidney; Liddle syndrome; metabolism; urine; 11-beta-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenase Type 2; Animals; Bile; Biological Markers; Glycyrrhetinic Acid; Glycyrrhiza; Humans; Kidney; Liddle Syndrome; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Medicine, Kampo; P-Glycoproteins",2-s2.0-84901837251

The aim of this study was to examine the activity of protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which leads to vascular superoxide production in type 2 diabetes, in addition to the effects of pravastatin. We studied these mechanisms in Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats (type 2 diabetes model) at the early hyperglycemic stage (vs. non-diabetic Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka [LETO] rats). Superoxide production and catalase activity were measured in aortas, as were the protein expressions of PKCδ and phospho-Ser1177 eNOS. Superoxide production was increased in OLETF rats, and this increase was inhibited by the selective conventional PKC (cPKC) inhibitor G?6976 and by the non-selective cPKC and novel PKC inhibitor GF109203X. Phospho-Ser1177 eNOS was significantly increased in OLETF rats, whereas the protein expressions of PKCδ and phosopho-Thr505 PKCδ and catalase activity were all greatly reduced. Pravastatin administration to OLETF rats in vivo had normalizing effects on all of these variables. The increment in superoxide production seen in OLETF rats (but not the production in pravastatin-treated OLETF rats) was abolished by high concentration of Nω-nitro-L- arginine methyl ester (electron transport inhibitor of eNOS), by sepiapterin (precursor of tetrahydrobiopterin), and by LY294002 (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [PI3-kinase] inhibitor). In OLETF rats at the early hyperglycemic stage, aortic superoxide production is increased owing to activation of uncoupled eNOS through phosphorylation by PI3-kinase/Akt. This may be related to the observed reduction in PKCδ/catalase activities. Pravastatin inhibited endothelial superoxide production via normalization of PKCδ/catalase activities. ? 2014 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Endothelial nitric oxide synthase; Hyperglycemia; Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rat; Pravastatin; Protein kinase C; Superoxide,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; catalase; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; isoprotein; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; n(g) nitroarginine methyl ester; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase inhibitor; phosphoserine; pravastatin; protein kinase C; sepiapterin; superoxide; tetrahydrobiopterin; triacylglycerol; catalase; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; enzyme inhibitor; glucose blood level; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; Nos3 protein, rat; pravastatin; protein kinase C; superoxide; animal experiment; animal model; aorta; article; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; drug mechanism; electron transport; enzyme activity; hyperglycemia; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; rat; risk factor; triacylglycerol blood level; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; complication; Coronary Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; drug effects; enzymology; glucose blood level; Long Evans rat; metabolism; vascular endothelium; Animals; Aorta; Blood Glucose; Catalase; Coronary Disease; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Endothelium, Vascular; Enzyme Inhibitors; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; Pravastatin; Protein Kinase C; Rats, Long-Evans; Superoxides",2-s2.0-84901828975

Objective home sleep monitoring is preferable for identifying sleep problems and improving sleep quality. Several instruments, most notably wrist actigraphy, have been used for this purpose. However, various impediments, including economic and practical concerns, have continued to hamper the widespread use of self-sleep monitoring. In this study, we used the contactless biomotion sensor based on SleepMinderTM with a frequency band modified from 5.8 GHz to 10.525Hz to comply with Japanese Radio Law. The purpose of the study was to validate the accuracy of the sleep-wake algorithm for adult outpatients used by this new sensing system. We examined the data using simultaneous polysomnography and compared the results with previous contactless biomotion sensor and actigraphy studies. Data were collected at two institutions, the Ota Memorial Sleep Center and Kuwamizu Hospital. In total, 211 adult subjects participated in the study, and 148 (99 subjects with apnea-hypopnea index score&gt;15) were used for the analysis. The overall accuracy of the new system was 84.1%, and its sensitivity and specificity were 91.8% and 37.6%, respectively. The automated algorithm slightly overestimated total sleep time (bias: +13min) and sleep efficiency (bias: +3%) compared with polysomnography. As for sleep onset latency and wake time after sleep onset, these were slightly underestimated. The results are comparable to previous contactless biomotion sensor and actigraphy studies, and indicate that this modified contactless biomotion sensor is sufficiently accurate for monitoring sleep-wake patterns in this population. ? 2014 Japanese Society of Sleep Research.",Actigraphy; Contactless; Polysomnography; Sensor; Sleep,accuracy; actimetry; adult; algorithm; apnea hypopnea index; article; biosensor; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; latent period; major clinical study; male; outpatient; polysomnography; priority journal; productivity; scoring system; sensitivity and specificity; sleep; sleep disordered breathing; validation study,2-s2.0-84901481847

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are closely involved in the development and progression of various tumors. Here we investigated the dysregulation of miRNAs in ATL and its clinical significance. Studies using miRNA arrays and subsequent real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction showed that, in the 9 ATL cell lines examined, 1 miRNA was consistently up-regulated, whereas another 3 were consistently down-regulated, compared with normal CD4-positive lymphocytes. Next, we analyzed the prognostic impact of these 4 miRNAs in patients with aggressive-type ATL (n = 40). Of the 4 dysregulated miRNAs selected, 3 (miR-130b higher expression, miR-145 lower expression, and miR-223 lower expression) were significantly associated with a worsened overall patient survival. We found that expressions of these 3 miRNAs were correlated with each other. To clarify which of the 3 had the most significant impact on overall survival, we performed a multivariate prognostic analysis that included these 3 miRNAs, and only miR-145 lower expression was selected as an independent risk factor (P =.0005). When overexpressed in an ATL cell line in vitro, miR-145 specifically inhibited tumor cell growth. In conclusion, our study suggests that miR-145 down-regulation provides a growth advantage in ATL and is highly associated with a worsened prognosis for patients with ALT. Hence, miR-145 may be a useful prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for ATL. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; Array analysis; MicroRNAs; miR-145; Prognosis,"microRNA; microRNA 145; microRNA 150; microRNA 155; microRNA 223; microRNA 34a; unclassified drug; adult; aged; article; cancer inhibition; cancer survival; CD4+ T lymphocyte; cell death; cell viability; clinical article; controlled study; down regulation; female; gene expression; genetic transfection; human; human cell; Human T cell leukemia virus 1; leukemia cell line; male; overall survival; prognosis; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA isolation; T cell leukemia; tumor growth; upregulation; very elderly; Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; Array analysis; MicroRNAs; miR-145; Prognosis; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Down-Regulation; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Male; MicroRNAs; Middle Aged; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Prognosis; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Tumor Markers, Biological",2-s2.0-84901467015

The prognosis of GC also remains poor because the molecular mechanisms of GC progression are incompletely understood. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs that are associated with gastric carcinogenesis. Studies investigating the regulation of gene expression by miRNAs have made considerable progress in recent years, and abnormalities in miRNA expression have been shown to be associated with the occurrence and progression of GC. miRNAs contribute to gastric carcinogenesis by altering the expression of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, affecting cell proliferation, apoptosis, motility, and invasion. Moreover, a number of miRNAs have been shown to be associated with tumor type, tumor stage, and patient survival and therefore may be developed as novel diagnostic or prognostic markers. In this review, we discuss the involvement of miRNAs in GC and the mechanisms through which they regulate gene expression and biological functions. Then, we review recent research on the involvement of miRmiRNAs in GC prognosis, their potential use in chemotherapy, and their effects on Helicobacter pylori infections in GC. A greater understanding of the roles of miRNAs in gastric carcinogenesis could provide insights into the mechanisms of tumor development and could help to identify novel therapeutic targets. ? 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

However, the mechanisms of RV adaptation, in particular RV energetics, in patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH) are still not well understood. We aimed to evaluate RV energetics including RV oxidative metabolism, power and efficiency to adapt to increasing pressure overload in patients with PH using 11C-acetate PET. Methods: In this prospective study, 27 patients with WHO functional class II/III PH (mean pulmonary arterial pressure 39.8±13.5 mmHg) and 9 healthy individuals underwent 11C-acetate PET. 11C-acetate PET was used to simultaneously measure oxidative metabolism (k mono) for the left ventricle (LV) and RV. LV and RV efficiency were also calculated. Results: The RV ejection fraction in PH patients was lower than in controls (p=0.0054). There was no statistically significant difference in LV k mono (p=0.09). In contrast, PH patients showed higher RV k mono than did controls (0.050±0.009 min-1 vs. 0.030±0.006 min-1, p&lt;0.0001). PH patients exhibited significantly increased RV power (p&lt;0.001) and hence increased RV efficiency compared to controls (0.40±0.14 vs. 0.017±0.12 mmHg·mL·min/g, p=0.001). Conclusion: The RV oxidative metabolic rate was increased in patients with PH. Patients with WHO functional class II/III PH also had increased RV power and efficiency. These findings may indicate a myocardial energetics adaptation response to increasing pulmonary arterial pressure. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Efficiency; Metabolism; Positron emission tomography; Pulmonary hypertension; Right ventricle,"acetic acid c 11; acetic acid derivative; carbon; carbon-11 acetate; radiopharmaceutical agent; adult; aerobic metabolism; article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; cardiovascular parameters; clinical article; controlled study; energy transfer; female; heart catheterization; heart ejection fraction; heart left ventricle; heart right ventricle function; heart right ventricle overload; heart stroke volume; human; left ventricle oxidative metabolism; lung artery pressure; male; metabolic rate; PET scanner; positron emission tomography; prospective study; pulmonary artery occlusion pressure; pulmonary hypertension; right ventricle aerobic metabolism; right ventricle efficiency; right ventricular energetic; systolic blood pressure; aged; case control study; diagnostic use; heart ventricle; metabolism; middle aged; oxygen consumption; pulmonary hypertension; scintiscanning; Acetates; Adult; Aged; Carbon; Case-Control Studies; Female; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Male; Middle Aged; Oxygen Consumption; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Right",2-s2.0-84900796296

We sought to quantify the burden of tobacco-smoking-related deaths in Asia, in parts of which men's smoking prevalence is among the world's highest.Methods and Findings:We performed pooled analyses of data from 1,049,929 participants in 21 cohorts in Asia to quantify the risks of total and cause-specific mortality associated with tobacco smoking using adjusted hazard ratios and their 95% confidence intervals. We then estimated smoking-related deaths among adults aged ?45 y in 2004 in Bangladesh, India, mainland China, Japan, Republic of Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan-accounting for ?71% of Asia's total population. An approximately 1.44-fold (95% CI = 1.37-1.51) and 1.48-fold (1.38-1.58) elevated risk of death from any cause was found in male and female ever-smokers, respectively. In 2004, active tobacco smoking accounted for approximately 15.8% (95% CI = 14.3%-17.2%) and 3.3% (2.6%-4.0%) of deaths, respectively, in men and women aged ?45 y in the seven countries/regions combined, with a total number of estimated deaths of ?1,575,500 (95% CI = 1,398,000-1,744,700). Among men, approximately 11.4%, 30.5%, and 19.8% of deaths due to cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and respiratory diseases, respectively, were attributable to tobacco smoking. Corresponding proportions for East Asian women were 3.7%, 4.6%, and 1.7%, respectively. The strongest association with tobacco smoking was found for lung cancer: A 3- to 4-fold elevated risk, accounting for 60.5% and 16.7% of lung cancer deaths, respectively, in Asian men and East Asian women aged ?45 y.Conclusions:Tobacco smoking is associated with a substantially elevated risk of mortality, accounting for approximately 2 million deaths in adults aged ?45 y throughout Asia in 2004. It is likely that smoking-related deaths in Asia will continue to rise over the next few decades if no effective smoking control programs are implemented.Please see later in the article for the Editors' Summary. ? 2014 Zheng et al.",,tobacco smoke; adult; alcohol consumption; article; Asia; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; disease association; education; ethnic group; female; gender; hazard ratio; human; lung cancer; male; marriage; mortality; prevalence; respiratory tract disease; smoking; tuberculosis; Cardiovascular Diseases; cost of illness; economics; middle aged; mortality; Neoplasms; Respiratory Tract Diseases; risk; risk factor; smoking; Adult; Asia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cost of Illness; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Prevalence; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Risk; Risk Factors; Smoking,2-s2.0-84900415399

We investigated the molecular communication mechanism of these cells and their involvement in kidney stone formation. Materials and Methods Mouse renal tubular cells (M-1) were cocultured with adipocytes (3T3-L1) and/or macrophages (RAW264.7). Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals were exposed to M-1 cells after 48-hour coculture and the number of calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals adherent to the cells was quantified. The expression of cocultured medium and M-1 cell inflammatory factors was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Results The inflammatory markers MCP-1, OPN and TNF-α were markedly up-regulated in cocultured M-1 cells. OPN expression increased in M-1 cells cocultured with RAW264.7 cells while MCP-1 and TNF-α were over expressed in M-1 cells cocultured with 3T3-L1 cells. Coculturing M-1 cells simultaneously with 3T3-L1 and RAW264.7 cells resulted in a significant increase in calcium oxalate monohydrate crystal adherence to M-1 cells. Conclusions Inflammatory cytokine changes were induced by coculturing renal tubular cells with adipocytes and/or macrophages without direct contact, indicating that crosstalk between adipocytes/macrophages and renal tubular cells was mediated by soluble factors. The susceptibility to urolithiasis of patients with metabolic syndrome might be due to aggravated inflammation of renal tubular cells triggered by a paracrine mechanism involving these 3 cell types. ? 2014 by American Urological Association Educaton and Research, Inc.",inflammation; kidney; metabolic syndrome X; obesity; urolithiasis,"monocyte chemotactic protein 1; osteopontin; tumor necrosis factor alpha; whewellite; calcium oxalate; cytokine; adipocyte; animal cell; article; cell structure; coculture; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; in vitro study; inflammation; kidney tubule cell; macrophage; metabolic syndrome X; nephrolithiasis; nonhuman; paracrine signaling; priority journal; protein expression; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; stone formation; upregulation; 3T3 cell line; adipocyte; animal; disease model; kidney tubule; macrophage; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; mouse; nephrolithiasis; pathology; Article; epithelium cell; metabolic syndrome X; polymerase chain reaction; quantitative study; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Animals; Calcium Oxalate; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Kidney Calculi; Kidney Tubules; Macrophages; Metabolic Syndrome X; Mice",2-s2.0-84900405525

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 1763 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who had undergone pulmonary resection and presented with a clinical diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases between January 2000 and December 2009 at 61 hospitals in Japan. The incidence and outcomes of acute exacerbation within 30 days from the operation were investigated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors of acute exacerbation. Results: Acute exacerbation occurred in 164 patients (9.3%; 95% confidence interval, 8.0-10.8), with a mortality rate of 43.9%, and was the top cause of 30-day mortality (71.7%). The following 7 independent risk factors of acute exacerbation were identified: surgical procedures, male sex, history of exacerbation, preoperative steroid use, serum sialylated carbohydrate antigen KL-6 levels, usual interstitial pneumonia appearance on computed tomography scan, and reduced percent predicted vital capacity. Surgical procedures showed the strongest association with acute exacerbation (using wedge resection as the reference, lobectomy or segmentectomy: odds ratio, 3.83; 95% confidence interval, 1.94-7.57; bi-lobectomy or pneumonectomy: odds ratio, 5.70; 95% confidence interval, 2.38-13.7; P <.001). The effect of perioperative prophylactics, such as steroids and sivelestat, was not confirmed in this study. Conclusions: Pulmonary resection for patients with lung cancer with interstitial lung diseases may provoke acute exacerbation at a substantially high rate and has high associated mortality. Surgical procedures that proved to be a risk factor for acute exacerbation should be chosen cautiously for these high-risk patients.

The present study evaluated histological findings of obliterative phlebitis, including the significance of adding Elastica van Gieson stain (EVG) in comparison with other pancreatic conditions. Methods: Specimens of LPSP (n = 18), chronic pancreatitis (CP; n = 24), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA; n = 45) were enrolled. Obliterative venous lesions (OVLs), defined as the presence of inflammatory cells and/or fibrosis inside the tunica adventitia, were counted and compared between hematoxylin and eosin stain (H&amp;E) and EVG. OVLs were classified into three types: OVL-1, lymphoplasmacytic infiltration and fibrosis against a loose textured background; OVL-2, dense fibrosis with minimal or no lymphoplasmacytic infiltration; and OVL-3, densely packed lymphoplasmacytic infiltration without fibrosis. OVL type and OVL size were compared between disease groups. Results: OVL counts in LPSP, CP, and PDA were significantly higher with EVG than with H&amp;E (p &lt; 0.001). OVL-1 was most common in LPSP (H&amp;E 92.4 %, EVG 79.8 %), and was identified in almost all cases of LPSP, but was less common in CP and PDA. Maximum diameter and OVL count in 1 cm2 of OVL-1 were high for LPSP. Maximum diameter of OVL-1 ?150 μm was observed in 17 LPSP, 0 CP, and 1 PDA cases (sensitivity 94.4 %, specificity 98.6 %). Conclusions: Additional EVG is useful for excluding conditions mimicking OVL-1 or detecting OVL in small specimens. The presence of OVL-1 with diameter ?150 μm is highly diagnostic for LPSP. ? 2013 Springer.",Autoimmune pancreatitis; IgG4-related disease; Lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis; Obliterative phlebitis,"dye; elastica van gieson stain; eosin; hematoxylin; unclassified drug; coloring agent; adult; aged; article; autoimmune pancreatitis; chronic pancreatitis; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; male; obliterative phlebitis; pancreas adenocarcinoma; phlebitis; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; adenocarcinoma; adolescent; adventitia; Autoimmune Diseases; classification; complication; diagnostic use; middle aged; pancreas duct; Pancreatic Neoplasms; pancreatitis; Pancreatitis, Chronic; pathology; phlebitis; staining; young adult; Adenocarcinoma; Adolescent; Adult; Adventitia; Aged; Autoimmune Diseases; Coloring Agents; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Ducts; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Phlebitis; Staining and Labeling; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84899972647

NKT cells accelerate atherosclerosis in mice. Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a bioactive sphingolipid and regulates T-lymphocyte trafficking. We aimed to determine the effects of S1P on the production of proinflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, in NKT cell hybridomas and mouse NKT cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: NKT cell hybridomas and sorted mouse NKT cells were stimulated with S1P and α-galactosylceramide (α-GalCer), the major ligand to produce cytokines in NKT cells. TNF-α mRNA expression and protein production were determined by real-time PCR and ELISA, respectively. Cell migration was assayed using chemotaxicell. Plasma S1P was measured using HPLC. RESULTS: Hybridomas expressed S1P receptors, S1P1, S1P2, and S1P4. S1P and α-GalCer increased TNF-α mRNA expression and protein production. S1P enhanced TNF-α induction by α-GalCer. S1P receptor antagonists decreased the TNF-α mRNA expression induced by S1P. FTY720, an immunosuppressive S1P receptor modulator, also decreased the TNF-α mRNA expression. The migration of NKT cell hybridomas was increased by S1P. FTY720 reduced the migration induced by S1P. S1P also increased the TNF-α mRNA expression in mouse NKT cells. Plasma TNF-α levels in patients with high plasma S1P (? 500 nmol/l) were higher than those in patients with low S1P (<500 nmol/l). CONCLUSION: S1P binds to S1P receptors in NKT cells and enhances TNF-α production. TNF-α overproduction may induce atherogenic inflammatory responses. S1P may serve as a novel therapeutic target for amelioration of vascular inflammatory diseases.? 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health.",atherosclerosis; flow-mediated dilation; FTY720; natural killer T cell; sphingosine-1-phosphate; tumor necrosis factor-α,"2 amino 2 (3 octylphenylcarbamoyl)ethyl phosphate; 4 (1 aminoethyl) n (4 pyridyl)cyclohexanecarboxamide; 4 (2,6 dichloro 4 pyridinyl) 1 (1,3 dimethyl 4 isopropyl 1h pyrazolo[3,4 b]pyridin 6 yl)semicarbazide; alpha galactosylceramide; CXCL16 chemokine; fingolimod; messenger RNA; sphingosine 1 phosphate; sphingosine 1 phosphate receptor; tumor necrosis factor alpha; autacoid; immunologic factor; lysophospholipid; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; SERPINE1 protein, human; sphingosine; sphingosine 1-phosphate; tumor necrosis factor alpha; animal cell; article; atherosclerosis; cell migration; chemotaxis; controlled study; cytokine production; dyslipidemia; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; high performance liquid chromatography; hybridoma; hypertension; lymphocyte migration; mouse; natural killer T cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; receptor binding; signal transduction; T lymphocyte activation; analogs and derivatives; animal; atherosclerosis; blood; C57BL mouse; coculture; drug effects; genetics; human; hybridoma; immunology; inflammation; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; natural killer T cell; neutrophil chemotaxis; rat; time; tumor cell line; Animals; Atherosclerosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Chemotaxis, Leukocyte; Coculture Techniques; Female; Humans; Hybridomas; Immunologic Factors; Inflammation; Inflammation Mediators; Lymphocyte Activation; Lysophospholipids; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Natural Killer T-Cells; Plasminogen Activator Inhibitor 1; Rats; Receptors, Lysosphingolipid; Signal Transduction; Sphingosine; Time Factors; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-84899949700

Objective: We sought to obtain direct evidence concerning the distribution of IL-31- and IL-31RA-protein expressing cells and their characteristics in AD skin samples and in human DRG. Methods: IL-31 was detected immunohistochemically in AD skins, and representative sections were double stained with IL-31 and several immune-markers. IL-31RA was stained immunohistochemically in AD skins and normal human DRG, and representative AD skins were double stained with IL-31RA and PGP9.5 (a nerve marker). Results: IL-31-positive cells were observed as mononuclear infiltrating cells and as CD11b co-expressing cells in severe AD samples. As for IL-31RA, positive reactions were detected in keratinocytes and nerve fibers in the dermis of AD and in the neurons of normal DRG. Conclusion: The detection of IL-31 in infiltrating cells of severe AD skin and of IL-31RA in nerve fibers of AD dermis and normal DRG indicates IL-31 signaling may be a contributing factor in the persistence and exacerbation of AD skin lesions. ? 2014 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology.",Atopic dermatitis; CD11b; Dorsal root ganglia; IL-31; IL-31RA; Nerve-fibers,"CD11b antigen; cell protein; immunoglobulin E; interleukin 31; interleukin 31 receptor alpha; major histocompatibility antigen; protein gene protein 9.5; T lymphocyte receptor; unclassified drug; IL31 protein, human; IL31RA protein, human; interleukin derivative; interleukin receptor; article; atopic dermatitis; cell granule; cell infiltration; clinical article; dermis; disease severity; dorsal root ganglia; ganglion; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunopathogenesis; inflammation; keratinocyte; mononuclear cell; nerve cell; nerve fiber; nonhuman; priority journal; protein localization; skin; skin cell; atopic dermatitis; metabolism; skin; Dermatitis, Atopic; Humans; Interleukins; Receptors, Interleukin; Skin",2-s2.0-84899947075

Methods: Three committees [the professional committee for making clinical questions (CQs) and statements by Japanese specialists, the expert panelist committee for rating statements by the modified Delphi method, and the evaluating committee by moderators] were organized. Fifteen specialists for AIP extracted the specific clinical statements from 1,843 articles published between 1963 and 2012 (obtained from Pub Med and a secondary database, and developed the CQs and statements. The expert panel individually rated the clinical statements using a modified Delphi approach, in which a clinical statement receiving a median score greater than seven on a nine-point scale from the panel was regarded as valid. Results: The professional committee created 13 CQs and statements for the current concept and diagnosis of AIP, 6 for extra-pancreatic lesions, 6 for differential diagnosis, and 11 for treatment.

However, advanced-stage cases with pleural dissemination are occasionally encountered. The outcome of surgical resection for thymomas with pleural dissemination has not been clearly determined. Methods We retrospectively investigated the clinical records of 2,835 patients with thymic epithelial tumors that were treated from 1991 to 2010 in 32 institutions that participated in the Japanese Association for Research on the Thymus. In this study, we analyzed the clinicopathologic factors and prognosis of thymoma patients with pleural dissemination who underwent surgical resection. Results The thymomas with pleural disseminations numbered 148 cases (5.2% in the 2,835 thymic epithelial tumors). Surgical resection was performed in 136 cases. Pathologic Masaoka stages were classified as IVA (n = 118) and IVB (n = 18). In Masaoka stage IVA disease, the small number of disseminated pleural nodules (10 or fewer) was related to the curative resection. The prognosis was also better in these cases than in those with greater than 10 disseminated pleural nodules (certified during the operation; p = 0.0057). Patients who underwent macroscopic total resection of disseminated nodules had a better prognosis than those with residual tumors (p = 0.037). In stage IVA cases with complete resection (n = 42), the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or both was not demonstrated. Conclusions Macroscopic total resection of tumors appears to be a promising prognostic factor in Masaoka stage IVA thymomas. The number of disseminated pleural nodules correlated with resectability. ? 2014 by The Society of Thoracic Surgeons.",,"adjuvant chemoradiotherapy; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; aged; article; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; female; human; Japan; lung resection; major clinical study; male; medical record review; pleura metastasis; priority journal; thymoma; tumor classification; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Cohort Studies; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Japan; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Staging; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial; Pleural Neoplasms; Prognosis; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Rare Diseases; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Statistics, Nonparametric; Survival Analysis; Thymectomy; Thymoma; Thymus Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84899900593

Although nucleos(t)ide analogs inhibiting viral reverse transcriptase are clinically available as anti-HBV agents, emergence of drug-resistant viruses highlights the need for new anti-HBV agents interfering with other targets. Here we report that cyclosporin A (CsA) can inhibit HBV entry into cultured hepatocytes. The anti-HBV effect of CsA was independent of binding to cyclophilin and calcineurin. Rather, blockade of HBV infection correlated with the ability to inhibit the transporter activity of sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). We also found that HBV infection-susceptible cells, differentiated HepaRG cells and primary human hepatocytes expressed NTCP, while nonsusceptible cell lines did not. A series of compounds targeting NTCP could inhibit HBV infection. CsA inhibited the binding between NTCP and large envelope protein in vitro. Evaluation of CsA analogs identified a compound with higher anti-HBV potency, having a median inhibitory concentration <0.2 μM. Conclusion: This study provides a proof of concept for the novel strategy to identify anti-HBV agents by targeting the candidate HBV receptor, NTCP, using CsA as a structural platform. ? 2014 The Authors.

Methods Three hundred twenty-three healthy adult subjects prospectively included at 10 centers and a cohort of 310 patients with hypertension were analyzed. Multidirectional global LV systolic function was analyzed using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography by means of two indices: longitudinal-circumferential systolic index (the average of longitudinal and circumferential global systolic strain) and global systolic index (the average of longitudinal, circumferential, and radial global systolic strain). Results The ranges of values of the multidirectional systolic parameters in healthy subjects were -21.22 ± 2.22% for longitudinal-circumferential systolic index and 29.71 ± 5.28% for global systolic index. In addition, the lowest expected values of these multidirectional indices were determined in this population (calculated as -1.96 SDs from the mean): -16.86% for longitudinal-circumferential systolic index and 19.36% for global systolic index. Concerning the clinical relevance of these measurements, these indices indicated the presence of subtle LV global systolic dysfunction in patients with hypertension, even though LV global longitudinal systolic strain and LV ejection fraction were normal. Moreover, in these patients, functional class (dyspnea [New York Heart Association classification]) was inversely related to both the longitudinal-circumferential index and the global systolic index. Conclusions In the present multicenter study analyzing a large cohort of healthy subjects and patients with hypertension, the normal range and the clinical relevance of multidirectional systolic parameters to evaluate global LV systolic function have been determined.

Alexithymia is a personality trait characterized by deficits in cognitive processing and regulation of emotions. A broad association between alexithymia and various health problems has been suggested, including depression, inflammation, and pain. The objective of this study was to examine the independent influence of alexithymia on pain perception and its relationship to depression and inflammation. Methods We evaluated 213 RA outpatients who completed self-administered questionnaires, including the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) to measure depression severity, the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) to measure degree of alexithymia, and a visual analog scale to quantify perceived pain. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were measured to quantify inflammation severity. Results An initial significant positive association between the TAS-20 score and pain severity (P = 0.01) lost significance after controlling for BDI-II score and CRP level using regression analysis. An interaction was observed among alexithymia, depression, and inflammation with regard to perceived pain. Among those without alexithymia, pain severity increased linearly with the CRP tertile levels regardless of the presence of depression (P < 0.001 for trend). No linear association between pain severity and CRP level was observed among those with alexithymia. Moreover, depressed patients with alexithymia (BDI-II score ?14 and TAS-20 score ?61) reported severe pain even at low CRP levels. Conclusion Alexithymia might have a substantial role in pain perception as well as depression in patients with RA. A biopsychosocial approach is essential to achieve better pain control. ? 2014, American College of Rheumatology.",,"C reactive protein; adult; alexithymia; article; Beck Depression Inventory; depression; disease association; disease severity; female; human; inflammation; major clinical study; male; nociception; observational study; physical disability; rheumatoid arthritis; secondary analysis; Toronto Alexithymia scale; visual analog scale; Adolescent; Adult; Affective Symptoms; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Depression; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84899104789

The study aimed to determine which aspects of QoL could be affected by CBT-I and how any changes in QoL were mediated by changes in insomnia and depression. Methods: We conducted a 4-week randomized controlled trial with 4-week follow-up in outpatient clinics in Japan. Thirtyseven patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of major depressive disorder concomitant with chronic insomnia were randomly assigned to the treatment-as-usual (TAU) alone arm or the TAU with brief behavioral therapy for insomnia (TAU plus psychotherapy) arm using modified CBT-I consisting of 4 weekly individual sessions. We evaluated QoL using norm-based scoring of the Short Form-36 at baseline and at 8 weeks. We also examined associations between QoL subscales and remission in insomnia or depression while controlling for baseline scores of the entire sample. Results: We tested group effects while controlling for baseline scores. TAU plus psychotherapy resulted in significantly better scores on physical functioning (p = 0.006), social functioning (p = 0.002), and mental health (p = 0.041) subscales than TAU alone at 8 weeks. Patients with either remitted insomnia or depression showed higher QoL scores than non-remitted patients; scores approximated those within the normal range. Conclusions: For patients with insomnia in depression, adding CBT-I to TAU can produce substantive benefits in some aspects of QoL.

Methods: In this study, 528 patients undergoing 6- to 18-month follow-up 64-slice MSCT after SES implantation without early clinical events were followed clinically (the median follow-up interval was 4.6 years). A CT-detected stent fracture was defined as a complete gap with Hounsfield units (HU) <300 at the site of separation. The major adverse cardiac events (MACEs), including cardiac death, stent thrombosis, and target lesion revascularisation, were compared according to the presence of stent fracture. Results: Stent fractures were observed in 39 patients (7.4 %). MACEs were more common in patients with CT-detected stent fractures than in those without (46 % vs. 7 %, p<0.01). Univariate Cox regression analysis indicated a significant relationship between MACE and stent fracture [hazard ratio (HR) 7.65; p<0.01], age (HR 1.03; p=0.04), stent length (HR 1.03; p<0.01), diabetes mellitus (HR 1.77; p=0.04), and chronic total occlusion (HR 2.54; p=0.01). In the multivariate model, stent fracture (HR 5.36; p<0.01) and age (HR 1.03; p=0.04) remained significant predictors of MACE.

However, the molecular activity in calcified plaques and their clinical significance have not been fully clarified yet. Methods: Carotid plaques from 18 endarterectomy patients were classified into high- and low-calcified plaques on the basis of Agatston calcium score. Twelve plaques were investigated for the alteration of gene expression by microarray analysis and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 6 other plaques underwent protein assessment to elucidate the difference in molecular biological activity between the groups. Results: Microarray analysis demonstrated 93 angiogenesis or growth factor-related transcripts that are reliably expressed (175 probe sets). Among them, angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) expression was significantly elevated, whereas fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) expression was significantly suppressed. Quantitative messenger RNA analysis was performed with real-time PCR. Augmented or decreased protein expression of each gene was confirmed by Western blotting analysis and immunohistochemistry. Conclusions: In high-calcified plaques, ANGPTL4 might be upregulated for antiangiogenic modulating function together with the downregulation of FGFR2, contributing to the stability of the plaques. ? 2014 by National Stroke Association.",angiogenesis; ANGPTL4; calcification; Carotid plaque; FGFR2; microarray analysis,"angiopoietin; angiopoietin 1; angiopoietin like protein 4; epidermal growth factor receptor; fibroblast growth factor; fibroblast growth factor 1; fibroblast growth factor 10; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; fibroblast growth factor receptor 2; growth factor; latent transforming growth factor beta binding protein; messenger RNA; nerve growth factor; platelet derived growth factor beta receptor; scatter factor; somatomedin binding protein; somatomedin binding protein 2; somatomedin binding protein 3; somatomedin binding protein 4; somatomedin binding protein 5; somatomedin binding protein 6; somatomedin C; transforming growth factor beta; transforming growth factor beta receptor; transforming growth factor beta receptor 2; transforming growth factor beta receptor 3; transforming growth factor beta1; transforming growth factor beta2; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; vasculotropin B; angiopoietin; ANGPTL4 protein, human; FGFR2 protein, human; fibroblast growth factor receptor 2; messenger RNA; adult; Agatston score; aged; angiogenesis; article; carotid artery; carotid atherosclerosis; carotid endarterectomy; clinical article; controlled study; female; gene expression; human; immunohistochemistry; male; microarray analysis; middle aged; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; unindexed sequence; upregulation; Western blotting; atherosclerotic plaque; blood vessel calcification; carotid artery disease; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; genetics; pathology; procedures; prognosis; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; severity of illness index; upregulation; Aged; Angiopoietins; Blotting, Western; Carotid Artery Diseases; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Middle Aged; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Prognosis; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Receptor, Fibroblast Growth Factor, Type 2; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Severity of Illness Index; Up-Regulation; Vascular Calcification",2-s2.0-84898491632

However, a critical complication is unpredictable post-ESD bleeding. Some risk factors for post-ESD bleeding have been reported previously, although those risk factors have not directly contributed toward prevention of post-ESD bleeding. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively identified 186 gastric neoplasms in 183 consecutive patients treated with ESD from 2005 to 2012 at Nagoya City University Hospital, and divided them into two groups on the basis of the presence or absence of post-ESD bleeding. Results: Of the 186 lesions, eight lesions (4.2%) developed post-ESD bleeding. Univariate analysis identified hypertension (38.8% in nonbleeding vs. 87.5% in bleeding; P=0.009) and depressed-type tumors (26.4% in nonbleeding vs. 62.5% in bleeding; P=0.040) as significantly related to the incidence of post-ESD bleeding. On multivariate analysis, hypertension (odds ratio, 11.55; 95% confidence interval, 1.20-111.66; P=0.034) and depressed-type tumors (odds ratio, 5.36; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-25.73; P=0.036) were independent risk factors for post-ESD bleeding. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) after ESD was significantly higher in the post-ESD bleeding group than in the post-ESD non-bleeding group (P=0.021), with the comorbidity of hypertension significantly correlating with SBP after ESD (ρ=0.332, P<0.001). Conclusion: Control of SBP after ESD is important for the prevention of post-ESD bleeding because hypertension as a comorbidity, which is associated positively with SBP after ESD, is a significant risk factor for post-ESD bleeding. ?

Recent studies have suggested that mutations in CovRS, a twocomponent regulatory system in Streptococcus pyogenes, play important roles in the pathogenesis of STSS. However, in vivo evidence of the significance of CovRS in human infections has not been fully demonstrated. We investigated five S. pyogenes strains isolated simultaneously from the pharynx, sputum, knee joint, cerebrospinal fluid and blood of a single STSS patient. All were emm89-type strains, and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis revealed that the strains of pharynx and blood were isogenic. The growth rates of the strains from pharynx and sputum were faster than those of the other strains. Protein profiles of the culture supernatants of strains from the pharynx and sputum were also different from those of the other strains. Sequence analyses revealed that strains from the knee joint, cerebrospinal fluid and blood contained a single nucleotide difference in the covS coding region, resulting in one amino acid change, compared with the other strains. Introduction of a plasmid containing the covS gene from the pharynx strain to the blood strain increased the production of SpeB protein. This suggests that the one amino acid alteration in CovS was relevant to pathogenesis. This report supports the idea that mutated CovS plays important roles in vivo in the dissemination of S. pyogenes from the upper respiratory tract of human to aseptic tissues such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid. ? 2014 SGM.",,"amino acid; bacterial protein; nucleotide; speb protein; unclassified drug; article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium culture; bacterium isolation; blood; case report; cerebrospinal fluid; controlled study; covs gene; gene mutation; genetic code; growth rate; human; knee; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; pharynx; plasmid; priority journal; protein analysis; sequence analysis; sputum; streptococcal toxic shock syndrome; Streptococcus pyogenes; supernatant; toxic shock syndrome; wild type; Antigens, Bacterial; Bacterial Outer Membrane Proteins; Bacterial Proteins; Carrier Proteins; Coinfection; DNA, Bacterial; Exotoxins; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Mutant Proteins; Mutation, Missense; Shock, Septic; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes",2-s2.0-84897826209

However, the complication rate of ERCPs in HD patients has not been evaluated sufficiently. We aimed to clarify the feasibility of ERCPs in HD patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 76 consecutive ERCPs for HD patients between January 2005 and December 2012 in one university hospital and three tertiary-care referral centers. Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST) was performed in 21 HD patients. We evaluated the incidence and risk factors for complications of all ERCPs and EST in HD patients. Results: The incidence of pancreatitis, cholangitis, and cardiopulmonary complications for ERCPs in HD patients was 7.9% (6/76), 1.3% (1/76), and 1.3% (1/76), respectively. The mortality rate was 2.6% (2/76), and it occurred after acute pancreatitis in one patient and pneumonia in the other patient. The incidence of hemorrhage and pancreatitis with EST was 19% (4/21) and 4.8% (1/21), respectively. The duration of HD was significantly longer in the patients with hemorrhage after EST than without (19.5 vs 6 years; P=0.029). Conclusions: ERCP is feasible in HD patients. However, EST is not advisable because of the high hemorrhage rate, particularly for patients with a long duration of HD. ? 2013 Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation and Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Complication; Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; Endoscopic sphincterotomy; Hemodialysis; Hemorrhage,"amylase; antithrombocytic agent; hemoglobin; acute pancreatitis; adult; aged; amylase blood level; article; aspiration pneumonia; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; cholangitis; cholecystitis; cohort analysis; common bile duct stone; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic sphincterotomy; erythrocyte transfusion; feasibility study; female; hemodialysis patient; hemoglobin blood level; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; pancreas cancer; pancreas necrosis; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; surgical mortality; very elderly; complication; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic sphincterotomy; hemodialysis; hemorrhage; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cholangiopancreatography, Endoscopic Retrograde; Cholangitis; Feasibility Studies; Female; Hemorrhage; Hospitals, University; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis; Pneumonia; Renal Dialysis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sphincterotomy, Endoscopic; Tertiary Care Centers; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84897640012

Methods: In 66 patients with HCV genotype 1 who had a late viral response (LVR) to 72-week treatment of pegylated-interferon and RBV, we examined the factors that determined the outcome, including single nucleotide polymorphisms of interleukin-28B and inosine triphosphatase (ITPA) genes. Results: Thirty seven of 66 (56%) patients with LVR achieved a sustained viral response (SVR). The mean age of these 37 SVR patients was 55, compared with 61 in 29 relapsed patients (P=0.009). Twenty six of 54 (48%) patients with the CC genotype and 11 of 12 (92%) with the CA/AA genotype of ITPA rs1127354 achieved SVR (P=0.006).

Finally, serum RBV concentration at week 44 of treatment was significantly higher in the SVR group (2651ng/mL) than in the relapse group (1989ng/mL, P=0.002). In contrast, the rate of the interleukin-28B genotype was not different between the groups. Multiple regression analysis showed that age <60 years, ITPA CA/AA genotype, and serum RBV concentration were significant independent predictive factors for SVR.

T2DM is also associated with androgen deficiency. However, there have been few basic studies on androgen replacement therapy (ART) for ED treatment in T2DM animal models, and the mechanism underlying the effect of ART on T2DM-induced ED is unclear. Aim: To investigate the effect of ART on ED in T2DM rats by examining inflammatory and nitric oxide (NO)-related factors. Methods: Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats and their controls, Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats, were distributed into three groups: LETO, OLETF, and ART. In the ART group, OLETF rats were treated daily with testosterone (3mg/kg/day, subcutaneously) from 20 to 25 weeks of age LETO and OLETF rats received vehicle only. Main Outcome Measures: We measured erectile function by using measurements of the ratio between intracavernosal pressure (ICP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) following electrical stimulation of the cavernous nerve and by evaluating the endothelial function of the corpus cavernosum in an isometric tension study. Expression of endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), inducible NO synthase (iNOS), sirtuin-1 (Sirt1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) mRNA was detected using polymerase chain reaction. Results: The ICP/MAP ratio in the OLETF group was significantly decreased and that in the ART group was significantly improved (P<0.01). The response to acetylcholine was significantly decreased in the OLETF group and improved in the ART group (P<0.01). Although expression of eNOS and Sirt1 mRNA was decreased and that of iNOS, IL-6, and TNF-α mRNA was increased in the OLETF group, ART improved mRNA expression. Conclusions: ART suppressed inflammation in rats with T2DM and metabolic disorders and improved their endothelial and erectile functions. ART could be effective for T2DM-induced ED and may be considered a potential ED treatment method. Kataoka T, Hotta Y, Maeda Y, and Kimura K.

Here, we investigated the relationship between the inflammatory reaction and BPH. METHODS cDNA microarray analysis was used to identify changes in inflammation-related gene expression in a recently established rat model that mimics human BPH. To investigate the genes identified in the analysis, quantitative (q)RT-PCR, Western blotting, immunostaining, and a cell proliferation assay were conducted using BPH model tissues, human prostate tissues, and normal human prostate cultured cells. RESULTS Of the 31,100 genes identified in the cDNA analysis, seven inflammatory-response- related genes were expressed at a >2-fold higher level in rat BPH tissues than in normal rat prostate tissues. The levels of the most commonly expressed pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-18, significantly increased in rat BPH tissues. In humans, IL-18 was localized in the epithelial and stromal components, while its receptor was strongly localized in smooth muscle cells. Furthermore, in human prostate smooth muscle cell line (PrSMC), IL-18 effected dose-dependent increases in the phosphorylated Akt and thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) levels. TSP-1 promoted proliferation of the human prostate stromal cells (PrSC).

PSC is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by idiopathic fibrous obstruction and is frequently associated with IBD. IBD-associated with PSC (PSC-IBD) shows an increased incidence of pancolitis, mild symptoms, and colorectal malignancy. Although an increased incidence of pan-colitis is a characteristic finding, some cases are endo-scopically diagnosed as right-sided ulcerative colitis. Pathological studies have revealed that inflammation occurs more frequently in the right colon than the left colon. The frequency of rectal sparing and backwash ileitis should be investigated in a future study based on the same definition. The cholangiographic findings of immunoglobulin G4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) are similar to those of PSC.

Methods Fifty-seven consecutive patients underwent RARP between August 2011 and April 2012. We performed RARP with and without bladder neck sling suspension technique for 27 (sling group) and 30 (nonsling group) patients, respectively, and compared the urinary outcome between the groups. Both subjective and objective assessments of urinary incontinence were performed before and after RARP. Results The International Prostate Symptom Score (P <.05) and International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire-Short Form (P <.05) in the sling group were significantly lower, and Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite urinary incontinence score (P <.05) in the sling group was higher than those in nonsling group, 4 weeks after RARP. In addition, mean pad weight gain on 1-hour pad test in the sling group was significantly smaller than that in the nonsling group, 4 weeks after RARP (P <.05). Both patient perception and objective data of urinary incontinence 4 weeks after RARP were better in the sling group than in the nonsling group. Valsalva maneuver during cystography demonstrated that the mean posterior urethrovesical angle in the sling group was smaller than that in the nonsling group (P <.001). Conclusion Bladder neck sling suspension technique is a simple and feasible procedure in RARP and can improve the early return of continence after RARP, although additional larger studies are required to confirm this finding.",,adult; aged; article; bladder neck sling suspension; clinical assessment tool; cystography; expanded prostate cancer index composite urinary incontinence score; feasibility study; human; ICIQ (incontinence); International Prostate Symptom Score; major clinical study; male; middle aged; priority journal; prostatectomy; robot assisted radical prostatectomy; surgical technique; treatment outcome; urine incontinence; Valsalva maneuver; weight gain; Adult; Aged; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Prostatism; Questionnaires; Recovery of Function; Robotics; Suburethral Slings; Time Factors; Urinary Bladder; Urinary Incontinence; Urodynamics,2-s2.0-84896717223

Zerumbone, a component of subtropical ginger, has been shown to exhibit anticancer activities in various cancer cells; however, little is known about its biological mechanisms against angiogenesis in pancreatic cancer (PaCa). Here, we evaluated the effects of zerumbone on PaCa angiogenesis. METHODS: The cytotoxicity of zerumbone in PaCa was measured using premix WST-1 cell proliferation assays. The influence of zerumbone on the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and interleukin 8 was measured using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Changes in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activities were measured using NF-κB transcription factor assays. We also examined the effects of zerumbone on PaCa-induced angiogenesis using angiogenesis assays. RESULTS: Zerumbone inhibited mRNA expression and protein secretion of angiogenic factors and NF-κB activity. Tube formation in human umbilical vein endothelial cells was enhanced by coculture with PaCa cells, and these enhancements were significantly inhibited by zerumbone treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Zerumbone blocked the PaCa-associated angiogenesis through the inhibition of NF-κB and NF-κB-dependent proangiogenic gene products. ? 2014 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Angiogenesis; NF-JB; Pancreatic cancer; Zerumbone,"immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 8; vasculotropin; zerumbone; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; interleukin 8; sesquiterpene; vasculotropin A; zerumbone; angiogenesis; article; cell proliferation assay; cytotoxicity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; human; human cell; pancreas cancer; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; umbilical vein endothelial cell; angiogenesis; cell culture; cell line; cell proliferation; coculture; dose response; drug effects; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Neovascularization, Pathologic; pancreas tumor; physiology; tumor cell line; vascularization; Cell Line; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Coculture Techniques; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Interleukin-8; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Neovascularization, Physiologic; NF-kappa B; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sesquiterpenes; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",2-s2.0-84896682476

The cellular origins of mature cystic teratomas are believed to be post-meiotic ovarian germ cells, and the analysis of microsatellite markers such as short tandem repeats is suitable for determining the cellular origin of tumors. In this study, we analyzed 3 ovarian mature cystic teratomas, all of which were associated with simultaneous ovarian mucinous tumors within the same ovary. Two of the 3 mucinous tumors were intestinal-type and the other was endocervical type. A laser capture microdissection technique was used to separate the epithelial component of the mucinous tumor, the components of the mature cystic teratoma, and control ovarian somatic tissue. Using short tandem repeat analysis based on 6 markers (D20S480, D6S2439, D6S1056, D9S1118, D4S2639, and D17S1290), we could distinguish the germ cell (homozygous) or somatic (heterozygous) origin of a given component in each sample. The epithelial components of the intestinal-type mucinous tumors in cases 1 and 2 were homozygous, and the epithelial component in case 3 (endocervical type) was heterozygous. All teratomatous components were homozygous, and the control components were heterozygous. In addition, we analyzed 3 mature cystic teratomas without mucinous tumors, and all 3 were homozygous in the tumor component. Our data suggest that the origin of mucinous tumors in the ovary may differ among histological subtypes, and intestinal-type mucinous tumors may arise from mature cystic teratomas, although endocervical-type mucinous tumors may not. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Mature cystic teratoma; Mucinous tumor of the ovary; Short tandem repeat analysis; Zygosity,"adult; article; clinical article; controlled study; disease association; epithelium; female; germ cell; heterozygote; histology; homozygote; human; human tissue; laser capture microdissection; middle aged; molecular genetics; ovarian mucinous tumor; ovary teratoma; ovary tumor; short tandem repeat; Article; epithelium cell; gene locus; histopathology; molecular genetics; somatic cell; teratoma; Mature cystic teratoma; Mucinous tumor of the ovary; Short tandem repeat analysis; Zygosity; Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous; Adult; Female; Humans; Laser Capture Microdissection; Microsatellite Repeats; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Multiple Primary; Ovarian Neoplasms; Teratoma",2-s2.0-84896547500

However, the possible link between cough variant asthma (CVA) and allergic rhinitis remains unknown. Objectives: To clarify the prevalence and clinical relevance of perennial allergic rhinitis or seasonal allergic rhinitis in CVA patients compared to classic asthma patients. Methods: We retrospectively studied adult patients with classic asthma (n = 190) and those with CVA (n = 83). The prevalence of perennial allergic rhinitis or seasonal allergic rhinitis and associations of concomitant perennial or seasonal allergic rhinitis with asthma severity, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (% predicted), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, and eosinophil proportions in sputum and blood were analyzed in the two groups. Results: The prevalence of perennial allergic rhinitis and/or seasonal allergic rhinitis was significantly higher in classic asthma patients than in CVA patients (all p < 0.05). Concomitant perennial allergic rhinitis was associated with higher FeNO levels and eosinophil proportions in sputum and blood in classic asthma patients (p = 0.035, p = 0.036, and p = 0.008, respectively) and with higher asthma severity, FeNO levels, and sputum eosinophil proportions in CVA patients (p = 0.031, p = 0.007, and p = 0.010, respectively). Concomitant seasonal allergic rhinitis was only associated with higher sputum eosinophil proportions in CVA patients with active rhinitis symptoms during the sensitized pollen season (p = 0.025). Conclusions: Perennial allergic rhinitis may be relevant for CVA patients as well as classic asthma patients by consistently augmenting eosinophilic lower airway inflammation. ? 2013 S.

We performed a prospective study to compare MC and EUS. Methods: A total of 70 patients with an early stage flat CRC lesion were enrolled at 6 institutions in Japan and randomly assigned to groups assessed by MC followed by EUS or EUS followed by MC. Results from MC and EUS measurements of 66 lesions were included in the final analysis. The invasion depth of each lesion was measured by each procedure and categorized as mucosal to slight submucosal (depth <1000 μm) or deep submucosal (depth ?1000 μm); measurements were compared with the final diagnosis on the basis of the pathology analysis. All participating examiners achieved a mean κ value ?0.6 for both MC and EUS before this trial. Results: MC and EUS each measured the depth of lesion invasion with 71.2% accuracy (correctly for 47 of 66 lesions). MC identified lesions with deep submucosal invasion with 74.2% sensitivity and 68.6% specificity, whereas EUS identified them with 67.7% sensitivity and 74.3% specificity. The differences between MC and EUS measurements did not differ significantly. However, MC required significantly shorter observation time than EUS (361.7 ± 164.5 seconds vs 451.2 ± 209.4 seconds, P= .002). Conclusions: MC and EUS are equally accurate in estimating the invasion depth of early stage CRC lesions. However, neither procedure has sufficient diagnostic accuracy to be used as the standard.University Hospital Medical Network Clinical Trials Registry, Number: UMIN000005085. ? 2014 AGA Institute.",Colon cancer; Endoscopic ultrasound; Magnifying colonoscopy; Neoplasm,"adult; aged; article; cancer diagnosis; cancer size; chromoendoscopy; clinical observation; colorectal cancer; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; early cancer; endoscopic echography; female; human; human tissue; magnifying endoscopy; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; predictive value; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sensitivity and specificity; tumor invasion; very elderly; young adult; Colon Cancer; Endoscopic Ultrasound; Magnifying Colonoscopy; Neoplasm; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colonoscopy; Colorectal Neoplasms; Early Diagnosis; Endosonography; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84896077427

Objectives We have developed and validated a new tool, the Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (NAPPA), with three components: a questionnaire assessing quality of life (NAPPA-QoL), a two-part questionnaire assessing patient-relevant treatment benefits (the Patient Benefit Index, NAPPA-PBI) and a psoriasis Clinical Assessment of Severity (NAPPA-CLIN). Methods Development of the questionnaires involved multiple steps: (i) collection of items about nail psoriasis-related impairments and treatment goals; (ii) selection of 48 items by an expert panel, including patients; (iii) translation into eight languages; (iv) feasibility testing and (v) longitudinal validation in six countries. Results Patients found the questionnaires clear (84%) and comprehensible (95%). NAPPA-QoL and NAPPA-PBI scores correlated moderately with clinical outcomes [e.g. Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI)] and markedly with other quality-of-life questionnaires (e.g. EQ-5D?). Both questionnaires were sensitive to change. Internal consistency was good (Cronbach α ? 0·88 for all scales). The NAPPA-CLIN, a brief version of NAPSI that involves assessment of only four digits rather than all 20, was found to correlate highly with total NAPSI score (r = 0·97, P < 0·001). Conclusions Overall, the three-component NAPPA tool is a valid, reliable and practical instrument to assess patient-relevant nail psoriasis outcomes. What's already known about this topic? Existing tools for assessment of nail psoriasis are complex and may not adequately measure outcomes that are important to patients. What does this study add? We developed and validated a new tool, the Nail Assessment in Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis (NAPPA), which assesses quality of life (NAPPA-QoL), patient-relevant treatment benefits (NAPPA-PBI) and nail psoriasis severity (NAPPA-CLIN).

Therefore, more convenient diagnostic and prognostic methods still required to optimize treatments among the patients. Here, we report the clinical significance of the serum cathepsin E (CatE) activity as a novel prognostic marker for BC. Correlation analysis between the serum levels of CatE expression and clinicopathological parameters revealed that the activity levels, but not the protein levels, were negatively associated with the stages and progression of BC. Univariate and multivariate analyses demonstrated that the serum CatE activity was significantly correlated with favorable prognostic outcomes of the patients. The functional link of CatE expression to BC progression was further corroborated by in vivo and in vitro studies with mice exhibiting different levels of CatE expression. Multiparous CatE-/- mice spontaneously developed mammary tumors concomitant with morphological transformation and altered growth characteristics of the mammary glands. These alterations were associated in part with the induction of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the activation of β-catenin-dependent pathway in mammary cells. Loss of CatE strongly induced the translocation and accumulation of Wnt5a in the nuclei, thereby leading to the aberrant trafficking, maturation and secretion of Wnt5a and the impaired signaling. The interaction of CatE and Wnt5a was verified by proximity ligation assay and by knockdown or restoration of CatE expression in the mammary cells. Consequently, our datademonstrate that CatE contributes to normal growth and developmentof mammary glands through proper trafficking andsecretion of Wnt5a. ? The Author 2013.

Moreover, the association between viral persistence after AHB and hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes in adults remains unclear. A nationwide multicenter study was conducted throughout Japan to evaluate the influence of clinical and virological factors on chronic outcomes in patients with AHB. For comparing factors between AHB patients with viral persistence and those with self-limited infection, 212 AHB patients without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) coinfection were observed in 38 liver centers until serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) disappeared or a minimum of 6 months in cases where HBsAg persisted. The time to disappearance of HBsAg was significantly longer for genotype A patients than that of patients infected with non-A genotypes. When chronicity was defined as the persistence of HBsAg positivity for more than 6 or 12 months, the rate of progression to chronicity was higher in patients with genotype A, although many cases caused by genotype A were prolonged cases of AHB, rather than chronic infection. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed only genotype A was independently associated with viral persistence following AHB. A higher peak level of HBV DNA and a lower peak of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were characteristics of AHB caused by genotype A. Treatment with nucleotide analogs (NAs) did not prevent progression to chronic infection following AHB overall. Subanalysis suggested early NA initiation may enhance the viral clearance. Conclusion: Genotype A was an independent risk factor for progression to chronic infection following AHB. Our data will be useful in elucidating the association between viral persistence after AHB, host genetic factors, and treatment with NAs in future studies. ? 2013 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.",,alanine aminotransferase; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; lamivudine; nucleotide derivative; virus DNA; antivirus agent; entecavir; guanine; hepatitis B surface antigen; drug derivative; acute hepatitis B; adult; Article; chronicity; controlled study; disease course; female; follow up; genotype; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; middle aged; mixed infection; multivariate logistic regression analysis; outcome assessment; priority journal; risk factor; viral clearance; young adult; analogs and derivatives; blood; clinical trial; cohort analysis; comparative study; genetics; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Japan; multicenter study; risk factor; time; virology; article; blood; hepatitis B; Japan; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Genotype; Guanine; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Japan; Lamivudine; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Young Adult; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Cohort Studies; Disease Progression; Female; Genotype; Guanine; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Japan; Lamivudine; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84894849675

Changes in the lifestyle of Japanese individuals over the past several decades is believed to have increased their total cholesterol levels and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in Japan. It is therefore important to assess the long-term trends in the HDL-C levels with respect to public health in the community. Methods: In this study, accumulated data for the serum/plasma HDL-C levels published in cohort studies and obtained during health checkup programs in Japan were analyzed with respect to time-dependent changes. Results: The levels of HDL-C have continuously and significantly increased over the past 20 years by 12-15% according to the National Health and Nutrition Study, other cohort studies and commercially available data. On the other hand, the non-HDL-cholesterol levels demonstrated no changes or only a slight decrease during the same period. This finding is consistent with several sets of data obtained from health checkup programs. The commercially measured levels of serum apoA-I, an independent parameter of serum HDL, also showed a similar long-term increase, supporting the above findings. Conclusion: We concluded that the serum/plasma HDL concentrations in Japanese individuals, selectively, have increased continuously and significantly over the past 20 years or more.

Design: A double-blinded, randomised, placebo-controlled multicentre clinical trial was conducted. Participants: 311 subjects with single/multiple colorectal adenomas and adenocarcinomas excised by endoscopy were enrolled in the study (152 patients in the aspirin group and 159 patients in the placebo group). Enrolment began at the hospitals (n=19) in 2007 and was completed in 2009. Results: The subjects treated with aspirin displayed reduced colorectal tumourigenesis and primary endpoints with an adjusted OR of 0.60 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.98) compared with the subjects in the placebo group. Subgroup analysis revealed that subjects who were nonsmokers, defined as those who had smoked in the past or who had never smoked, had a marked reduction in the number of recurrent tumours in the aspirin-treated group. The adjusted OR for aspirin treatment in nonsmokers was 0.37 (CI 0.21 to 0.68, p<0.05). Interestingly, the use of aspirin in smokers resulted in an increased risk, with an OR of 3.44. In addition, no severe adverse effects were observed in either group. Conclusions: Low-dose, enteric-coated aspirin tablets reduced colorectal tumour recurrence in an Asian population.

The clinical diagnosis and medical management of IBD in East Asia differ from those in Western countries. A questionnaire-based survey was performed to gather physicians' current opinions on IBD in different East Asian countries. Methods: Representative International Gastrointestinal Consensus Symposium (IGICS) committee members provided a questionnaire to physicians in each East Asian country studied. The questionnaire mainly focused on the diagnosis and management of IBD. Results: There were 19 respondents from Japan, 10 from South Korea, 9 from the Philippines, 6 from China and 4 from Indonesia. Colonoscopy (100%) and histopathology (63%) were commonly used for the diagnosis in ulcerative colitis (UC). Conventional small bowel enteroclysis was still the most common diagnostic tool for assessing small bowel lesions in Crohn's disease (CD) in East Asia. The percentage of physicians who investigated the reactivation of Cytomegalovirus in severe or refractory patients with UC ranged from 0% in the Philippines and Indonesia to 100% in Japan and Korea. Most physicians in Korea, the Philippines, China and Indonesia chose thiopurines or anti-TNF therapy as the second-line treatment in severe refractory UC, whereas Japanese physicians preferred to use tacrolimus or leukocyte apheresis. Physicians in the Philippines and Indonesia preferred to use oral 5-aminosalicylic acid for newly diagnosed severe ileocecal CD. In contrast, Korean physicians chose oral steroids and most physicians in China and Japan preferred to use anti-TNF. Nutritional therapy to induce or maintain remission in patients with CD was commonly used in Indonesia, Japan and China. Targeted biopsies by conventional colonoscopy were the most preferred strategy for cancer surveillance in long-standing UC over random biopsies in this region. Conclusions: The present survey found that current diagnostic approaches and clinical management of IBD vary within East Asian countries. ? 2014 S.

Chronic hepatitis has also been associated with aberrant DNA methylation, but little is known about their relationship. Methods Pyrosequencing was used to determine the methylation status of cultured Huh7.5.1 hepatoma cells after hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We also studied mice with severe combined immunodeficiency carrying the urokinase-type plasminogen activator transgene controlled by an albumin promoter (urokinase-type plasminogen activator/severe combined immunodeficient mice), in which up to 85% of hepatocytes were replaced by human hepatocytes (chimeric mice). Mice were given intravenous injections of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HCV, liver tissues were collected, and DNA methylation profiles were determined at different time points after infection. We also compared methylation patterns between paired samples of hepatocellular carcinomas and adjacent nontumor liver tissues from patients. Results No reproducible changes in DNA methylation were observed after infection of Huh7.5.1 cells with HCV. Livers from HBV- and HCV-infected mice had genome-wide, time-dependent changes in DNA methylation, compared with uninfected urokinase-type plasminogen activator/severe combined immunodeficient mice. There were changes in 160 ± 63 genes in HBV-infected and 237 ± 110 genes in HCV-infected mice. Methylation of 149 common genes increased in HBV- and HCV-infected mice; methylation of some of these genes also increased in hepatocellular carcinoma samples from patients compared with nontumor tissues. Expression of Ifng, which is expressed by natural killer cells, increased significantly in chimeric livers, in concordance with induction of DNA methylation, after infection with HBV or HCV. Induction of Ifng was reduced after administration of an inhibitor of natural killer cell function (anti-asialo GM1). Conclusions In chimeric mice with humanized livers, infection with HBV and HCV appears to activate a natural kill cell-dependent innate immune response. This contributes to the induction and accumulation of aberrant DNA methylation in human hepatocytes. ? 2014 by the AGA Institute.",Epigenetic; Gene Regulation; Inflammatory Response; Liver Cancer,"cycline; estrogen receptor alpha; gamma interferon; gangliotetraosylceramide; gangliotetraosylceramide antibody; Ki 67 antigen; Ras association domain family protein 1A; reactive oxygen metabolite; unclassified drug; urokinase; zinc finger protein; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell proliferation; controlled study; CpG island; DNA methylation; elovl fatty acid elongase 3 gene; estrogen receptor alpha gene; gamma interferon gene; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; hepatoma cell; innate immunity; Kupffer cell; line1 gene; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver regeneration; mouse; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; pyrosequencing; ras association domain family protein 1a gene; SCID mouse; transcription factor hoxa6 gene; transgene; urokinase gene; virus cell interaction; zinc finger protein 385a gene; Epigenetic; ESR1; estrogen receptor 1; Gene Regulation; HBV; HBx; HCC; HCV; hepatitis B virus; hepatitis B virus X; hepatitis C virus; hepatocellular carcinoma; homeobox A6; HOXA6; IFN; Inflammatory Response; interferon; Liver Cancer; MCAM; methylated CpG island amplification microarray; natural killer; NK; PCNA; proliferating cell nuclear antigen; Ras association domain family 1 isoform A; RASSF1A; reactive oxygen species; ROS; SCID; severe combined immunodeficient; Adolescent; Adult; Animals; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Line, Tumor; Child; Child, Preschool; Chimerism; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis C; Humans; Immunity, Innate; Killer Cells, Natural; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Lymphocyte Activation; Male; Mice; Mice, SCID; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84892759791

We studied the tumor promoting activity of nZnO by an initiation-promotion protocol using human c-Ha-ras proto-oncogene transgenic rats (Hras128 rats). The rats were given 0.2 % N-nitrosobis(2-hydroxypropyl)amine (DHPN) in the drinking water for 2 weeks and then treated with 0.5 ml of 250 or 500 μg/ml nZnO suspension by intra-pulmonary spraying once every 2 weeks for a total of 7 times. Treatment with nZnO particles did not promote DHPN-induced lung carcinogenesis. However, nZnO dose-dependently caused epithelial hyperplasia of terminal bronchioles (EHTB) and fibrosis-associated interstitial pneumonitis (FAIP) that were independent of DHPN treatment. Tracing the fate of EHTB lesions in wild-type rats indicated that the hyperplastic lesions almost completely disappeared within 12 weeks after the last nZnO treatment. Since nZnO particles were not found in the lung and ZnCl2 solution induced similar lung lesions and gene expression profiles, the observed lesions were most likely caused by dissolved Zn2+. In summary, nZnO did not promote carcinogenesis in the lung and induced EHTB and FAIP lesions that regressed rapidly, probably due to clearance of surplus Zn2+ from the lung. ? 2013 The Author(s).",Epithelial hyperplasia of terminal bronchioles; Interstitial pneumonitis; Lung carcinogenesis; Lung fibrosis; Lung toxicity; Nanosized zinc oxide particles,"bis(2 hydroxypropyl)nitrosamine; drinking water; zinc chloride; zinc oxide; animal tissue; article; bronchiole; controlled study; cytotoxicity; epithelium hyperplasia; female; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; interstitial pneumonia; lung; lung alveolus cell; lung carcinogenesis; macrophage; microscopy; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; transgenic rat; transmission electron microscopy; wild type; Rattus; Animals; Bronchioles; Carcinogenicity Tests; Chlorides; Epithelial Cells; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genes, ras; Humans; Hyperplasia; Lung Diseases, Interstitial; Lung Neoplasms; Nanoparticles; Nitrosamines; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Rats, Transgenic; Zinc Compounds; Zinc Oxide",2-s2.0-84892573137

However, the effects of zerumbone against cancer angiogenesis have not been fully elucidated. In this study, we clarified the role of zerumbone in gastric cancer angiogenesis. We examined the expression of vascular endo thelial growth factor (VEGF) in gastric cancer cell lines both in the basal state and following zerumbone treatment by real-time RT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Changes in gastric cancer cell proliferation in response to zerumbone treatment were measured by WST-1 assay. Additionally, the effects of zerumbone on NF-κB activity were examined in AGS cells. Finally, the effects of zerumbone on angiogenesis in AGS cells were measured by in vitro angiogenesis assay in which human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and fibroblasts were cocul tured with AGS cells. Among the 6 gastric cancer cell lines tested, AGS cells exhibited the highest expression of VEGF. Cell proliferation, VEGF expression and NF-κB activity in AGS cells were all significantly inhibited by zerumbone. Moreover, the tube formation area of HUVECs was increased by coculture with AGS cells, and this effect was inhibited by zerumbone. Both VEGF expression and NF-κB activity in AGS cells were reduced by treatment with zerumbone, thereby inhibiting angiogenesis. Thus, zerumbone may become a new anti-angiogenic and antitumor drug in the treatment of gastric cancer.",Angiogenesis; Gastric cancer; Vascular endothelial growth factor; Zerumbone,"immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; vasculotropin; zerumbone; antiangiogenic activity; article; cancer cell culture; cell proliferation; controlled study; drug response; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fibroblast; human; human cell; in vitro study; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; stomach cancer; umbilical vein endothelial cell; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Antineoplastic Agents; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Coculture Techniques; Human Umbilical Vein Endothelial Cells; Humans; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Sesquiterpenes; Stomach Neoplasms; Transcription Factor RelA; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",2-s2.0-84891922829

Recently, genome-wide association studies revealed an association between serum uric acid levels and a common variant of leucine-rich repeat-containing 16A (LRRC16A) gene. However, it remains to be clarified whether LRRC16A contributes to the susceptibility to gout. In this study, we investigated the relationship between rs742132 in LRRC16A and gout. A total of 545 Japanese male gout cases and 1,115 male individuals as a control group were genotyped. rs742132 A/A genotype significantly increased the risk of gout, conferring an odds ratio of 1.30 (95 % CI 1.05-1.60; p = 0.015). LRRC16A encodes a protein called capping protein ARP2/3 and myosin-I linker (CARMIL), which serves as an inhibitor of the actin capping protein (CP). CP is an essential element of the actin cytoskeleton, which binds to the barbed end of the actin filament and regulates its polymerization. In the apical membrane of proximal tubular cells in the human kidney, the urate-transporting multimolecular complex (urate transportsome) is proposed to consist of several urate transporters and scaffolding proteins, which interact with the actin cytoskeleton. Thus, if there is a CARMIL dysfunction and regulatory disability in actin polymerization, urate transportsome may be unable to operate appropriately. We have shown for the first time that CARMIL/LRRC16A was associated with gout, which could be due to urate transportsome failure. ? 2013 The Author(s).",Gouty arthritis; PDZ domain-containing 1 (PDZK1); Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP); Sodium-proton exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1); Urate transport,actin capping protein; actin related protein 2; actin related protein 3; leucine rich repeat containing 16A protein; myosin I; protein; scaffold protein; unclassified drug; urate transporter; actin filament; actin polymerization; apical membrane; article; controlled study; disease predisposition; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; gout; human; kidney tubule cell; major clinical study; male; priority journal; protein interaction; risk factor; Actin Cytoskeleton; Actins; Carrier Proteins; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genetic Variation; Genotype; Gout; Humans; Male; Organic Anion Transporters; Polymerization; Uric Acid,2-s2.0-84891854494

We performed meta-analyses to evaluate the impact of being overweight on acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) risk and survival. Original data were obtained from MEDLINE, and studies that evaluated being overweight before transplantation in recipients as a risk factor for aGVHD or a prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) were extracted. Study-specific relative risks on the log scale comparing overweight with non-overweight patients were used to obtain a pooled RR with 95% confidence interval (CI). We identified 8 studies of aGVHD and 21 of OS. In allogeneic HSCT, the meta-analysis determined statistically significant associations of overweight recipients with aGVHD risk and OS. Meta-analysis of the 8 studies of aGVHD indicated that the RR for overweight to non-overweight patients was 1.186 (95% CI: 1.072-1.312). Regarding OS, meta-analysis of 11 allogeneic HSCT studies indicated that the RR for overweight to non-overweight patients was 1.163 (1.009-1.340). Our results indicate that being overweight before transplantation in recipients is associated with a high aGVHD rate and worse survival after allogeneic HSCT. Potential heterogeneity especially in adult/pediatric patients limits the interpretability of our finding.

Design A randomized, multicenter, double-masked phase 3 study. Participants A total of 177 treatment-naive patients with macular edema secondary to CRVO were randomized in a 3:2 ratio. Methods Patients received either 2-mg intravitreal aflibercept or sham injections every 4 weeks for 20 weeks. From week 24 to 48, the aflibercept group received aflibercept as needed (pro re nata [PRN]), and the sham group continued receiving sham injections. Main Outcome Measures The primary efficacy end point was the proportion of patients who gained 15 letters or more in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at week 24. This study reports week 52 results including the proportion of patients who gained 15 letters or more in BCVA and the mean change from baseline BCVA and central retinal thickness. Efficacy end points at week 52 were all exploratory. Results At week 52, the mean percentage of patients gaining 15 letters or more was 60.2% in the aflibercept group and 32.4% in the sham group (P = 0.0004). Aflibercept patients, compared with sham patients, had a significantly higher mean improvement in BCVA (+16.9 letters vs. +3.8 letters, respectively) and reduction in central retinal thickness (-423.5 μm vs. -219.3 μm, respectively) at week 52 (P < 0.0001 for both). Aflibercept patients received a mean of 2.5 injections (standard deviation, 1.7 injections) during PRN dosing. The most common ocular adverse events in the aflibercept group were related to the injection procedure or the underlying disease, and included macular edema (33.7%), increased intraocular pressure (17.3%), and eye pain (14.4%). Conclusions Treatment with intravitreal aflibercept provided significant functional and anatomic benefits after 52 weeks as compared with sham. The improvements achieved after 6 monthly doses at week 24 largely were maintained until week 52 with as-needed dosing. Intravitreal aflibercept generally was well tolerated. ? 2014 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",,"aflibercept; article; central retina vein occlusion; central retinal thickness; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; eye pain; human; intraocular pressure abnormality; major clinical study; phase 3 clinical trial; pneumonia; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; retina macula edema; rhinopharyngitis; thromboembolism; visual acuity; visual impairment; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Double-Blind Method; Humans; Intravitreal Injections; Macular Edema; Quality of Life; Receptors, Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Retinal Vein Occlusion; Treatment Outcome; Visual Acuity",2-s2.0-84891626905

The present study aimed at identifying endogenous compounds in human plasma and urine specimens as biomarkers to evaluate drug interactions involving MATEs in the kidney without administration of their exogenous probe drugs. Methods: An untargeted metabolomic analysis was performed using urine and plasma samples from healthy volunteers and mice treated with or without the potent MATE inhibitor, pyrimethamine. Plasma and urinary concentrations of candidate markers were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Transport activities were determined in MATE- or OCT2-expressing HEK293 cells. The deuterium-labeled compounds of candidates were administered to mice for pharmacokinetics study. Results: Urinary excretion of eleven compounds including thiamine and carnitine was significantly lower in the pyrimethamine-treatment group in humans and mice, whereas no endogenous compound was noticeably accumulated in the plasma. The renal clearance of thiamine and carnitine was decreased by 70%-84% and 90%-94% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively, in human. The specific uptake of thiamine was observed in MATE1-, MATE2-K- or OCT2-expressing HEK293 cells with Km of 3.5 ± 1.0, 3.9 ± 0.8 and 59.9 ± 6.7 μM, respectively. The renal clearance of carnitine-d 3 was decreased by 62% in mice treated with pyrimethamine. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that MATEs account for the efflux of thiamine and perhaps carnitine as well as drugs into the urine. The urinary excretion of thiamine is useful to detect drug interaction involving MATEs in the kidney. ? 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",drug interaction; metabolomics; multidrug and toxin extrusion protein; organic cation; tubular secretion,acetylcarnitine; biological marker; carnitine; deuterium; metformin; organic cation transporter 2; pyrimethamine; thiamine; animal experiment; animal tissue; area under the curve; article; cell strain HEK293; circadian rhythm; controlled study; drug blood level; drug urine level; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; human experiment; kidney clearance; limit of quantitation; male; mass spectrometry; metabolomics; mouse; nonhuman; normal human; priority journal; protein blood level; protein urine level; urinary excretion; Adult; Animals; Biological Markers; Biological Transport; Cell Line; Drug Interactions; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Kidney; Male; Mice; Organic Cation Transport Proteins; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84891624684

In most mammalian species, ingested iAs is excreted mainly through urine primarily as dimethylarsinic acid (DMAV). In wild-type (WT) mice, iAs, DMAV, and dimethylarsinous acid (DMAIII) exposures induce formation of intramitochondrial urothelial inclusions. Arsenite (iAsIII) also induced intranuclear inclusions in arsenic (+3 oxidation state) methyltransferase knockout (As3mt KO) mice. The arsenic-induced formation of inclusions in the mouse urothelium was dose and time dependent. The inclusions do not occur in iAs-treated rats and do not appear to be related to arsenic-induced urothelial cytotoxicity. Similar inclusions in exfoliated urothelial cells from humans exposed to iAs have been incorrectly identified as micronuclei. We have characterized the urothelial inclusions using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), DNA-specific 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and non-DNA-specific Giemsa staining and determined the arsenical content. The mouse inclusions stained with Giemsa but not with the DAPI stain. Analysis of urothelial mitochondrial- and nuclearenriched fractions isolated from WT (C57BL/6) and As3mt KO mice exposed to arsenate (iAsV) for 4 weeks showed higher levels of iAsV in the treated groups. iAsIII was the major arsenical present in the enriched nuclear fraction from iAsV-treated As3mt KO mice. In conclusion, the urothelial cell inclusions induced by arsenicals appear to serve as a detoxifying sequestration mechanism similar to other metals, and they do not represent micronuclei. ?

METHODS: The Japanese Joint Committee of Lung Cancer Registry performed a nationwide retrospective registry study on the prognosis and clinicopathological profiles of 11 663 patients who underwent resection for primary lung neoplasm in 2004. The registry data of 7921 (62.5%) patients with adenocarcinoma were analysed regarding the prognosis and clinicopathological features according to the histological subtype of adenocarcinoma. The histological subtypes were defined according to the 1999 World Health Organization classification (third edition), where bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC) is defined as adenocarcinoma with a pure bronchioloalveolar growth pattern without invasion. RESULTS: The distribution of the histological subtype was acinar in 471 patients (7.5%), papillary in 2004 (32.2%), BAC in 1385 (22.3%), solid adenocarcinoma with mucin in 103 (1.7%) and adenocarcinoma with mixed subtypes (AMS) in 2257 (36.3%). The 5-year overall survival rates according to histological subtype were 63.4% for acinar, 72.9% for papillary, 90.3% for BAC, 54.4% for solid adenocarcinoma with mucin and 73.7% for AMS. While the survival rate in patients with BAC was significantly better than those for the other histological subtypes, acinar and solid adenocarcinoma with mucin had significantly worse prognoses than the other histological subtypes. The histological subtype was an independent predictor of survival in a multivariate analysis (P < 0.001). Regarding BAC, the pathological stage included not only Stage IA/IB (n = 1275; 92.1%), but also Stage II-IV (n = 110; 7.9%). One hundred twenty-five patients (9.0%) with BAC had recurrence, including both local and distant recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: The histological subtype in adenocarcinoma significantly correlated with the prognosis. In BACs with recurrence or pathological stage II-IV, these tumours might have been classified as invasive adenocarcinoma rather than as BAC. The need for the rigorous pathological evaluation of adenocarcinomas that are considered to be a preinvasive or minimally invasive tumour should be addressed in the new lung adenocarcinoma classification to be proposed by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, the American Thoracic Society and the European Respiratory Society. ?

Method: The details of three consecutive cases involving male patients in their forties, with locally invasive low rectal cancers are presented. The da Vinci robotic system was used by experienced colorectal and urological surgeons to perform en bloc resection of the rectum, prostate and seminal vesicles. Results: In the first case, coloanal and vesico-urethral anastomoses were performed, and the second included an end colostomy and vesico-urethral anastomosis. The bladder and bulbar urethra were also removed en bloc in the third case, with robotic intracorporeal ileal conduit formation and end colostomy. There was no major complication postoperatively. In the second patient there was a minor leakage at the vesico-urethral anastomosis. The third was readmitted the following week with a urinary infection which settled with intravenous antibiotics. In the first case, the circumferential resection margin was microscopically positive but the patient is currently free of recurrence after 14?months. In the second and third cases, all margins were clear. Conclusion: This the first report of the use of the da Vinci robotic system for pelvic exenteration in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer invading the prostate and seminal vesicles.

The natural ligand of NTSR1 is neurotensin (NT), a neuromodulator of the central nervous system. Because NT is also involved in many oncogenic actions, the signaling mediator NTSR1 is a significant molecular target in medicinal and therapeutic fields. In the current study, we constructed a fluorescence-based microbial yeast biosensor that can monitor the activation of human NTSR1 signaling responding to its agonist. To increase the sensitivity of the biosensor, a yeast strain with the green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter gene was genetically engineered to enhance binding with human NTSR1 expressed on the membrane. Following previous reports, the 5 carboxy-terminal amino acid residues of the guanine nucleotide binding protein α-subunit (Gα) in yeast Gpa1p were substituted with the equivalent human Gαq sequences (Gpa1/Gαq transplant). After optimizing the assay conditions, the Gα-engineered yeast demonstrated significantly improved sensing for NTSR1 signaling. Because detection using a GFP fluorescence reporter considerably simplifies the measurement procedure, this microbial fluorescence sensor holds promise for use in the diagnosis of NTSR1-associated diseases and the development of agonists. ? 2013 Elsevier Inc.
