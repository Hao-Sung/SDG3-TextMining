"A case of dihydropyrimidinase deficiency incidentally detected by urine metabolome analysis",2019,"Dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease affecting the second step of pyrimidine degradation. It is caused by mutations in the DPYS gene. Only approximately 30 cases have been reported to date, with a phenotypical variability ranging from asymptomatic to severe neurological illness. We report a case of dihydropyrimidinase deficiency incidentally detected by urine metabolome analysis. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based urine metabolomics demonstrated significant elevations of dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine, which were subsequently confirmed by a quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Genetic testing of the DPYS gene revealed two mutations: a novel mutation (c.175G > T) and a previously reported mutation (c.1469G > A). Dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is probably underdiagnosed, considering its wide phenotypical variability, nonspecific neurological presentations, and an estimated prevalence of 2/20,000. As severe 5-fluorouracil-associated toxicity has been reported in patients and carriers of congenital pyrimidine metabolic disorders, urinary pyrimidine analysis should be considered for those who will undergo 5-fluorouracil treatment. ? 2018 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; creatine kinase; dihydropyrimidinase; dihydrouracil; fluorouracil; fructose bisphosphate aldolase; pyrimidine; thymine; uracil; pyrimidine derivative; adolescent; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; asymptomatic disease; autosomal recessive disorder; case report; child; clinical article; creatine kinase blood level; differential diagnosis; dihydropyrimidinase deficiency; dpys gene; enzyme deficiency; gene; gene mutation; genetic screening; human; incidental finding; intelligence quotient; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; mass fragmentography; metabolome; metabolomics; muscle cramp; pyrimidine metabolism; quantitative analysis; school child; urinalysis; urine sampling; complication; diagnostic imaging; disorders of purine and pyrimidine metabolism; inborn error of metabolism; liquid chromatography; mass spectrometry; muscle cramp; nerve conduction; urine; Adolescent; Chromatography, Liquid; Humans; Mass Spectrometry; Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Metabolome; Muscle Cramp; Neural Conduction; Purine-Pyrimidine Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Pyrimidines"
"MEG3-derived miR-493-5p overcomes the oncogenic feature of IGF2-miR-483 loss of imprinting in hepatic cancer cells",2019,"Numerous studies have described the critical role played by microRNAs (miRNAs) in cancer progression and the potential of these small non-coding RNAs for diagnostic or therapeutic applications. However, the mechanisms responsible for the altered expression of miRNAs in malignant cells remain poorly understood. Herein, via epigenetic unmasking, we identified a group of miRNAs located in the imprinted delta like non-canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1)-maternally expressed 3 (MEG3) locus that were repressed in hepatic tumor cells. Notably, miR-493-5p epigenetic silencing was correlated with hypermethylation of the MEG3 differentially regulated region (DMR) in liver cancer cell lines and tumor tissues from patients. Experimental rescue of miR-493-5p promoted an anti-cancer response by hindering hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell growth in vitro and tumor progression in vivo. We found that miR-493-5p mediated part of its tumor-suppressor activity by abrogating overexpression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and the IGF2-derived intronic oncomir miR-483-3p in HCC cells characterized by IGF2 loss of imprinting (LOI). In summary, this study describes an unknown miRNA-dependent regulatory mechanism between two distinct imprinted loci and a possible therapeutic window for liver cancer patients exhibiting IGF2-miR-483 LOI and amplification. ? 2019, The Author(s).","microRNA; microRNA 493 5p; somatomedin B; unclassified drug; Article; cancer cell; cell growth; controlled study; delta like non canonical notch ligand 1 gene; epigenetics; gene locus; human; human cell; liver cancer; liver cancer cell line; liver tumor; maternally expressed 3 gene; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; tumor growth"
"The efficacy of maintenance therapy after remission induction with tacrolimus in ulcerative colitis with and without previous tumor necrosis factor-α inhibitor",2019,"Background and Aim: Tacrolimus (TAC) is an important therapeutic option for remission induction in patients with refractory ulcerative colitis (UC). However, there is little evidence available on long-term outcomes and maintenance treatments after TAC therapy, especially in cases with previous tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor therapy. Methods: Long-term outcomes and remission induction after TAC treatment were retrospectively examined in refractory UC patients with and without previous TNF-α inhibitor therapy. Results: The mean disease activity index and the endoscopic activity index scores decreased significantly during the 12-week treatment after TAC therapy in both groups, showing a significantly greater decrease in the group without TNF-α inhibitor therapy than in the group with previous TNF-α inhibitor therapy. One year or more after TAC therapy, TNF-α inhibitor and/or azathioprine was used as maintenance therapy in most cases in the group without previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment, while azathioprine was primarily used in the group with previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment. Colectomy was performed in 45.5% (5/11) and 15.6% (7/45) of the groups with and without previous TNF-α inhibitor therapy, respectively, and the group without previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment had a better colectomy-free rate than the group with previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment after TAC therapy on Kaplan–Meier analysis. Conclusions: TAC is effective for remission induction in refractory UC patients with and without previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment. Maintenance medication after TAC therapy is an issue for the future, especially in UC cases with previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment failure. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Effectiveness and safety of lower dose sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim therapy for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases: A retrospective multicenter study",2019,"Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of lower-dose sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim therapy (SMX/TMP) for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases. Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, we compared effectiveness and safety of SMX/TMP for the treatment of PCP among patients divided into three groups according to the initial dosage of SMX/TMP: the low, ?10 mg/kg/day; the intermediate, 10–15 mg/kg/day; and the high and conventional, 15–20 mg/kg/day for TMP dose. Results: Eighty-one patients, including 22, 30, and 29 patients in the low-, the intermediate- and the high-dose group could be analyzed and the 30-day survival rate were 100%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively (P = 0.28). There were significant dose-dependent increasing trends of severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for SMX/TMP that were graded as ?3 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. When stratified by presence of severe hypoxemia defined by alveolar-arterial O2 gradient ?45 mmHg, the 30-day survival and treatment modification rate were similar among the three groups, but frequency of severe ADRs were significantly decreased in the low-dose group. The low-dose group was independently and negatively associated with treatment modification within 14 days and severe ADRs. Conclusions: Lower dose SMX/TMP therapy with ?10 mg/kg/day for TMP was as effective as higher dose therapy for the treatment of PCP and associated with lower rates of treatment modification and severe ADRs in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases. ? 2018 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases","alanine aminotransferase; aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; atovaquone; cotrimoxazole; creatinine; methylprednisolone; pentamidine; antiinfective agent; cotrimoxazole; adult; adult onset Still disease; aged; anemia; Article; bone marrow suppression; connective tissue disease; controlled study; creatinine blood level; dermatomyositis; disease severity; dose response; drug dose comparison; drug dose reduction; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug megadose; erythema multiforme; female; fever; giant cell arteritis; human; hyperkalemia; hypertransaminasemia; hyponatremia; hypoxemia; low drug dose; lung alveolus oxygen tension; lymphatic system disease; major clinical study; male; microscopic polyangiitis; middle aged; nausea; neutrophil count; oxygen therapy; platelet count; Pneumocystis pneumonia; polymyositis; retrospective study; rheumatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis; side effect; Sjoegren syndrome; survival rate; survival time; systemic disease; systemic lupus erythematosus; systemic vasculitis; treatment duration; treatment outcome; clinical trial; complication; immunology; immunosuppressive treatment; isolation and purification; mortality; multicenter study; opportunistic infection; Pneumocystis carinii; Pneumocystis pneumonia; procedures; rheumatic disease; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Humans; Immunosuppression; Male; Middle Aged; Opportunistic Infections; Pneumocystis carinii; Pneumonia, Pneumocystis; Retrospective Studies; Rheumatic Diseases; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination"
"Distinct methylation levels of mature microRNAs in gastrointestinal cancers",2019,"The biological significance of micro (mi)RNAs has traditionally been evaluated according to their RNA expression levels based on the assumption that miRNAs recognize and regulate their targets in an unvarying fashion. Here we show that a fraction of mature miRNAs including miR-17-5p, -21-5p, and -200c-3p and let-7a-5p harbor methyl marks that potentially alter their stability and target recognition. Importantly, methylation of these miRNAs was significantly increased in cancer tissues as compared to paired normal tissues. Furthermore, miR-17-5p methylation level in serum samples distinguished early pancreatic cancer patients from healthy controls with extremely high sensitivity and specificity. These findings provide a basis for diagnostic strategies for early-stage cancer and add a dimension to our understanding of miRNA biology. ? 2019, The Author(s).","biological marker; epidermal growth factor; microRNA; RNA methyltransferase; microRNA; MIRN17 microRNA, human; MIRN200 microRNA, human; MIRN21 microRNA, human; tumor marker; biology; cancer; methylation; protein; RNA; serum; Article; binding site; bioinformatics; body mass; BxPC-3 cell line; cancer diagnosis; Capan-2 cell line; cell culture technique; chemical modification; clinical article; colorectal cancer; controlled study; digestive system cancer; gene expression; genetic transfection; HCT 116 cell line; high throughput sequencing; human; human cell; human tissue; immunoprecipitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; microarray analysis; nucleotide sequence; Panc 10.05 cell line; PSN1 cell line; real time polymerase chain reaction; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; RNA methylation; RNA sequence; sensitivity and specificity; upregulation; blood; epigenetics; gastrointestinal tumor; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry; metabolism; methylation; molecular dynamics; tumor cell line; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cell Line, Tumor; Epigenomics; Gastrointestinal Neoplasms; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Methylation; MicroRNAs; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Spectrometry, Mass, Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization"
"Peripartum depression and infant care, sleep and growth",2019,"Peripartum depression is a common, serious complication in mothers. To assess the influence of infant care, sleep and growth on the risk of peripartum depression, 1,271 mothers of healthy one-month-old infants completed comprehensive questionnaires including the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Relationships between high depression scores and variables related to infants’ care, sleep and growth were assessed adjusting for other variables. High depression scores were found in 233 mothers, which were associated with variables related to infants’ care (poor satisfaction with infant care support, p < 0.001; mothers’ passive response to night-time fussing, p = 0.001), sleep (dim bedroom lighting, p < 0.05; short sleep duration, p < 0.05) and growth (poor weight gain, p < 0.05), as well as maternal variables (primiparas, p < 0.001; poor income satisfaction, p < 0.001; poor sleep satisfaction, p < 0.001; daytime sleepiness, p = 0.001). Considering the observed association between high depression scores and infants’ care, sleep and growth, a multidisciplinary approach accounting for infant care would be required to prevent peripartum depression. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"The Effect of Pedaling Cadence on Skeletal Muscle Oxygenation during Cycling at Moderate Exercise Intensity",2019,"The aim of this study was to assess the changes determined by increased cadence on skeletal muscle oxygenation during cycling at an exercise intensity equal to the ventilatory threshold (T vent ). Nine healthy, active individuals with different levels of cycling experience exercised at a power output equal to T vent , pedaling at cadences of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 rpm, each for 4 min. Cadences were tested in a randomized counterbalanced sequence. Cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses were studied using an ECG for heart rate, and gas calorimetry for pulmonary oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production. NIRS was used to determine the tissue saturation index (TSI), a measure of vastus lateralis oxygenation. TSI decreased from rest to exercise; the magnitude of this TSI reduction was significantly greater when pedaling at 90 rpm (-14±4%), compared to pedaling at 40 (-12±3%) and 50 (-12±3%) rpm (P=0.027 and 0.017, respectively). Albeit small, the significant decrease in ΔTSI at increased cadence recorded in this study suggests that skeletal muscle oxygenation is relatively more affected by high cadence when exercise intensity is close to T vent . ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.","lactic acid; adult; blood; cycling; female; heart rate; human; male; middle aged; oxygen consumption; physiology; skeletal muscle; young adult; Adult; Bicycling; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Lactic Acid; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Consumption; Young Adult"
"Calcineurin regulates cyclin D1 stability through dephosphorylation at T286",2019,"The Calcineurin/NFAT (nuclear factor of activated T cells) pathway plays an essential role in the tumorigenic and metastatic properties in breast cancer. The molecular mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of calcineurin inhibition, however, is poorly understood. We found that calcineurin inhibition delayed cell cycle progression at G1/S, and promoted cyclin D1 degradation by inhibiting dephosphorylation at T286. Importantly, overexpression of cyclin D1 partially rescued delayed G1/S progression, thereby revealing cyclin D1 as a key factor downstream of calcineurin inhibition. Cyclin D1 upregulation is observed in human invasive breast cancers, and our findings indicate that dysregulation of T286 phosphorylation could play a role in this phenomenon. We therefore propose that targeting site specific phosphorylation of cyclin D1 could be a potential strategy for clinical intervention of invasive breast cancer. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Structural and functional analyses of retinal ischemia in eyes with retinal vein occlusion: Relationship with macular edema or microaneurysm formation",2019,"Purpose: To study the structural and functional changes of retinal ischemia and investigate their association with macular edema (ME) or microaneurysm (MA) formation in eyes with retinal vein occlusion (RVO). Methods: Sixty eyes of 30 patients (27 eyes with branch [b]RVO, 3 with central RVO, and 30 fellow eyes) were retrospectively reviewed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA), and microperimetry were performed simultaneously to measure retinal thickness and sensitivity. The presence of ME or MA was also assessed using OCT and fluorescein angiography. Results: The mean retinal sensitivity in the nonperfused areas (NPAs) deteriorated, and this was significantly (r -0.379, p 0.0391) and inversely correlated with duration from disease onset. ME and MA were unlikely to be observed around the area where the retinal sensitivity decreased. In the NPAs, the mean retinal thickness of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) (p 0.0001), deep capillary plexus (DCP) (p 0.0323), and outer retina (p 0.0008) were significantly thinner than those in the fellow eyes, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the thicknesses of the DCP (?: 0.3107, p = 0.0007) and outer retina (?: 0.3482, p = 0.0001) were the independent correlative factors of the retinal sensitivity, but that SCP thickness was not. Conclusion: Deep retinal thinning in NPAs was correlated significantly with a decreased retinal sensitivity, which might be a negative predictor of ME and MA in eyes with RVO. ? 2018 S.

"Exposure to marital conflict: Gender differences in internalizing and externalizing problems among children",2019,"Purpose Marital conflict is integral to children's psychosocial well-being. Extant research has shown that the effects of marital conflict on children are likely to vary by gender, indicating that gender plays a significant and complex role in the relationship between marital conflict and child adjustment. Focusing on gender, this study investigates the link between specific marital conflict tactics and children's mental health symptoms in families in which the parents live together. Methods This study gathered data from 799 children and their parents in Japan by means of a questionnaire focusing on marital conflict and child behavioral problems. Marital conflict (verbal aggression, physical aggression, stonewalling, avoidance-capitulation, child involvement, and cooperation) was assessed using a Conflict and Problem-Solving Scale. Children's behavioral problems (externalizing and internalizing symptoms) were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results The findings highlight the significant impact of specific interparental conflict on children's behavioral problems, demonstrating that there are differences according to the child's gender. More specifically, multivariate analyses targeting boys revealed that cooperation was significantly inversely associated with externalizing problems and internalizing problems, while avoidance-capitulation and verbal aggression were significantly positively associated with externalizing problems. In contrast, multivariate analyses targeting girls revealed that cooperation was significantly inversely associated with externalizing problems and internalizing problems, while avoidance-capitulation and stonewalling were significantly positively associated with internalizing problems. Conclusion This study reveals that interparental conflict is associated with children's behavioral problems. Constructive marital conflict was significantly inversely associated with externalizing and internalizing problems in both boys and girls. Meanwhile, destructive marital conflict (i.e., avoidance-capitulation and verbal aggression) was significantly positively associated with externalizing problems in boys and significantly positively associated with internalizing problems in girls. These findings contribute to the substantial literature demonstrating the relationship between family processes and the development of disruptive behavior disorders in children. ? 2019 Hosokawa, Katsura.

"A clinical dose of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and heterozygous ACE deletion exacerbate Alzheimer's disease pathology in mice",2019,"Inhibition of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a strategy used worldwide for managing hypertension. In addition to converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ACE also converts neurotoxic β-amyloid protein 42 (Aβ42) to Aβ40. Because of its neurotoxicity, Aβ42 is believed to play a causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas Aβ40 has neuroprotective effects against Aβ42 aggregation and also against metal-induced oxidative damage. Whether ACE inhibition enhances Aβ42 aggregation or impairs human cognitive ability are very important issues for preventingADonset and for optimal hypertension management. In an 8-year longitudinal study, we found here that the mean intelligence quotient of male, but not female, hypertensive patients taking ACE inhibitors declined more rapidly than that of others taking no ACE inhibitors. Moreover, the sera of all AD patients exhibited a decrease in Aβ42-to-Aβ40-converting activity compared with sera from age-matched healthy individuals. Using human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, we found that a clinical dose of an ACE inhibitor was sufficient to increase brain amyloid deposition. We also generated human amyloid precursor protein/ACE+/- mice and found that a decrease in ACE levels promoted Aβ42 deposition and increased the number of apoptotic neurons. These results suggest that inhibition of ACE activity is a risk factor for impaired human cognition and for triggering AD onset. ? 2019 Lin et al.

"Treatment of male stress urinary incontinence using autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells: Long-term efficacy and safety",2019,"Objectives: To investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of periurethral injection of autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells for the treatment of post-prostatectomy stress urinary incontinence. Methods: A total of 13 patients with persistent stress urinary incontinence after prostate surgery (radical prostatectomy, 10 patients; holmium laser enucleation of the prostate, three patients) underwent periurethral injection of adipose-derived regenerative cells and were followed up for >4?years. A 24-h pad test was carried out for four consecutive days in each evaluation period, and changes in the mean daily leakage volume during the 4?days from baseline to 60?months after treatment were evaluated. Results: The mean follow-up period was 69?months (range 55–72?months). The mean leakage volume/24?h in all patients changed from 260.7?g to 152.7?g. Urinary incontinence progressively improved up to 12?months after treatment in 10 patients, who maintained improvement up to the final assessment, with the mean daily leakage volume decreasing from 281.5?g to 119.0?g (reduction rate 57.7%). The other three patients showed no improvement at 1?year and at the final assessment. After the perioperative period, significant adverse events or prostate-specific antigen increase were not observed during long-term follow up. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that periurethral injection of autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells is a safe and feasible treatment modality with long-term efficacy for patients with male stress urinary incontinence caused by urethral sphincter deficiency. ? 2018 The Japanese Urological Association","prostate specific antigen; adipose derived regenerative cell; aged; Article; cancer surgery; cell therapy; clinical article; enucleation; follow up; human; liposuction; male; perioperative period; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; stress incontinence; subcutaneous hemorrhage; very elderly"
"Clinical practice guidelines for IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis",2019,"IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) is a distinct type of cholangitis frequently associated with autoimmune pancreatitis and currently recognized as a biliary manifestation of IgG4-related disease. Although clinical diagnostic criteria of IgG4-SC were established in 2012, differential diagnosis from primary sclerosing cholangitis and cholangiocarcinoma is sometimes difficult. Furthermore, no practical guidelines for IgG4-SC are available. Because the evidence level of most articles retrieved through searching the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Igaku Chuo Zasshi databases was below C based on the systematic review evaluation system of clinical practice guidelines MINDS 2014, we developed consensus guidelines using the modified Delphi approach. Three committees (a guideline creating committee, an expert panelist committee for rating statements according to the modified Delphi method, and an evaluating committee) were organized. Eighteen clinical questions (CQs) with clinical statements were developed regarding diagnosis (14 CQs) and treatment (4 CQs). Recommendation levels for clinical statements were set using the modified Delphi approach. The guidelines explain methods for accurate diagnosis, and safe and appropriate treatment of IgG4-SC. ? 2018 The Authors.

"Outcomes of Fusions From the Cervical Spine to the Pelvis",2019,"Study Design: Retrospective cohort study. Objective: Determine the indications, complications, and clinical outcomes in patients requiring fusions from the cervical spine to the pelvis. Several investigators have examined fusions from the thoracic spine to the sacrum, but no similar study has been performed for cervical-to-pelvis fusions. Methods: Patients from 2003 to 2014 with an upper instrumented vertebrae (UIV) in the cervical spine (any level) and a lower instrumented vertebrae (LIV) in the sacrum or pelvis were included in the study. Those with infectious or acute trauma-related deformities were excluded. Patient demographics, medical history, diagnosis, operative procedure, and health-related quality of life measures were analyzed. Student’s t test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and χ 2 test were used as appropriate; significance was set at P &lt;.05 for all tests. Results: Fifty-five patients met inclusion criteria for the study. Average follow-up was 2.8 years. Proximal junctional kyphosis was the most common indication for cervical-to-pelvis fusions (36%). The most common UIV was C2 (29%) followed by C7 (24%). There was an average 31° correction in maximum kyphosis and a 3.3 cm improvement in sagittal vertical axis. In adults, the rate of complication was 71.4%, with a major complication rate of 39.3% and reoperation rate of 53.6%. There was significant improvement in the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-22r) score (3.0 to 3.5; P &lt;.01). Conclusion: Proximal junctional kyphosis is the most common indication for patients requiring fusion to the cervical spine. Adult patients incur a significant risk of major complications and reoperations. However, significant improvement in SRS-22r outcomes are noted in these patients. ?

"Phase II trial of trastuzumab and docetaxel in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive salivary duct carcinoma",2019,"PURPOSE: Clinical evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of systemic therapy for advanced salivary duct carcinoma (SDC) is lacking because of the disease's rarity. We assessed the efficacy and toxicity of trastuzumab plus docetaxel in patients with locally advanced and/or recurrent or metastatic human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive SDC. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This was a single-center, single-arm, open-label, phase II study in Japan. The patients received trastuzumab at a loading dose of 8 mg/kg, followed by 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Docetaxel 70 mg/m 2 was administrated every 3 weeks. The primary end point was the overall response rate; the secondary end points included the clinical benefit rate, progression-free survival, overall survival, and toxicity. This study is registered with the University Hospital Medical Information Network Clinical Trials Registry (Identification No. UMIN000009437). RESULTS: Fifty-seven eligible patients with SDC were enrolled. The overall response rate was 70.2% (95% CI, 56.6% to 81.6%), and the clinical benefit rate was 84.2% (95% CI, 72.1% to 92.5%). Median progression-free and overall survival times were 8.9 months (95% CI, 7.8 to 9.9 months) and 39.7 months (95% CI, not reached), respectively. The most frequent adverse event was anemia (52 patients [91%]), followed by a decreased WBC count (51 patients [89%]) and neutropenia (50 patients [88%]). The most frequently observed grade 4 adverse event was a decreased neutrophil count (34 patients [60%]). Grade 3 febrile neutropenia was reported in eight patients (14%). No grade 2 or greater adverse events of heart failure or left ventricular ejection fraction decline to less than 50% occurred. CONCLUSION: Our data show encouraging efficacy of trastuzumab plus docetaxel therapy in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive SDC, with a manageable toxicity profile. ? 2018 by American Society of Clinical Oncology.","alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; creatinine; docetaxel; trastuzumab; antineoplastic agent; docetaxel; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; trastuzumab; abdominal pain; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; alopecia; anemia; anorexia; arthralgia; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; backache; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer survival; colitis; constipation; coughing; creatinine blood level; diarrhea; dizziness; drug efficacy; dysgeusia; dyspnea; fatigue; febrile neutropenia; female; fever; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; hematologic disease; human; hyperglycemia; hyperkalemia; hyperuricemia; hypoalbuminemia; hypocalcemia; hyponatremia; infusion related reaction; leukocyte count; loading drug dose; lung infection; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; median survival time; multiple cycle treatment; nausea; neutropenia; neutrophil count; oral mucositis; overall survival; pain; paronychia; phase 2 clinical trial; platelet count; pleura effusion; pneumonia; priority journal; progression free survival; pruritus; rash; salivary duct carcinoma; sensory neuropathy; sepsis; side effect; stomach hemorrhage; stomach ulcer; survival rate; treatment response; unspecified side effect; vomiting; clinical trial; drug administration; enzymology; metabolism; middle aged; pathology; salivary gland tumor; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Docetaxel; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Progression-Free Survival; Receptor, ErbB-2; Salivary Gland Neoplasms; Trastuzumab; Treatment Outcome"
"Methylation analysis for postpartum depression: A case control study",2019,"Background: Postpartum depression (PPD) is a major depressive disorder that occurs after childbirth. Objective diagnostic and predictive methods for PPD are important for early detection and appropriate intervention. DNA methylation has been recognized as a potential biomarker for major depressive disorder. In this study, we used methylation analysis and peripheral blood to search for biomarkers that could to lead to the development a predictive method for PPD. Methods: Study participants included 36 pregnant women (18 cases and 18 controls determined after childbirth). Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were obtained by analysis with an Infinium Human Methylation 450BeadChip. The association of DNA methylation status at each DNA methylation site with PPD was assessed using linear regression analysis. We also conducted functional enrichment analysis of PPD using The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery 6.8 to explore enriched functional-related gene groups for PPD. Results: In the analysis with postpartum depressed state as an independent variable, the difference in methylation frequency between the postpartum non-depressed group and the postpartum depressed group was small, and sites with genome-wide significant differences were not confirmed. After analysis by The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery 6.8, we revealed four gene ontology terms, including axon guidance, related to postpartum depression. Conclusions: These findings may help with the development of an objective predictive method for PPD. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; Article; axon guidance; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; DNA determination; DNA methylation; female; gene; gene ontology; genome-wide association study; human; postnatal depression; prediction; pregnant woman; questionnaire; self report"
"Effect of Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx Extracts on Murine Streptococcus pyogenes Infection by Modulating Immune System",2019,"Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes) causes several infectious diseases such as tonsillitis, cellulitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. The general treatment of S. pyogenes infection is by using β-lactam antibiotics; however, the cases of treatment failure were increasing as serious problems. Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx (LCE) has been used in the folk medicine in the northern part of Japan, the northern part of China, Korea, and Russia. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of three parts (fruit, stem, and leaf) of Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx extract (LCEEs) against murine S. pyogenes infection. Oral administration of LCEEs increased the mortality in murine model, and the extracts of its stems and leaves were more effective than the fruit extract significantly. Murine splenocytes and mesenteric lymph nodal cells treated with LCEEs suppressed the excess production of inflammatory cytokine such as TNF-α in comparison to those from untreated cells. LCEEs stimulated the differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells in those murine lymph nodal cells. It also activated the proliferative response of murine lymph nodal cells. We also found that the stem and leaf extracts seemed to be more effective than the fruit extract in those phenomena. The concentration of lignins in LCEE prepared from the stems was larger than that from leaves, and that was larger than that from the fruits. Our data suggest that LCE, especially the stems and the leaves, may be useful for the treatment of S. pyogenes infection. ? 2019 Masaaki Minami et al.","antiinflammatory agent; Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx extract; plant extract; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; cytokine; plant extract; tumor necrosis factor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antiinflammatory activity; Article; cell differentiation; controlled study; drug efficacy; fruit; group A streptococcal infection; hematopoietic stem cell; immunomodulation; Lonicera; Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx; mouse; nonhuman; plant leaf; plant stem; spleen cell; animal; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; Lonicera; microbiology; pathogenicity; pathology; Streptococcus infection; Streptococcus pyogenes; Animals; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Fruit; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Lonicera; Mice; Plant Extracts; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha"
"Clinical characteristics and outcomes of open globe injuries in Japan",2019,"Purpose: To describe the epidemiology and clinical outcomes of open globe injuries (OGIs) in Japan over 10 years, and examine preoperative factors influencing the visual prognosis after surgery. Study Design: Retrospective, observational, multicenter case-series study. Methods: Patients’ data were entered into a computerized database for review and statistical analyses. The following parameters were assessed; age, gender, initial and final visual acuity, duration between onset and surgery, presence of lens in the eye, characteristics of injury, presence of ocular complications, and number of surgeries. Results: The records of 374 eyes with OGI were enrolled. The average age of the patients was 56.8 ± 22.1 years, and the majority of patients were men (73.5%). Compared to the overall cohort, work-related OGI was the most common, associated with significantly better final visual acuity, whereas patients with fall-down OGI showed significantly worse final visual acuity (P < 0.05). Among the types of injury, both the initial and final visual acuity were significantly worse in the rupture group than in the laceration group. Multiple liner regression analyses revealed that the final visual acuity was significantly associated with initial visual acuity, type of injury (rupture), retinal detachment, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Conclusion: To predict the visual outcome in patients with OGI, ophthalmologists need to pay attention not only to the initial visual acuity but also to initial ocular conditions, such as the presence of ocular complications. ? 2018, Japanese Ophthalmological Society.","adult; Article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease activity; disease association; disease duration; eye injury; eye surgery; female; gender; groups by age; human; Japan; laceration; lens; major clinical study; male; medical record; middle aged; multicenter study; observational study; occupational disease; open globe injury; ophthalmologist; patient coding; postoperative complication; postoperative period; prediction; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; prognosis; retina detachment; retrospective study; visual acuity; vitreoretinopathy; adolescent; age distribution; aged; child; classification; clinical trial; eye injury; incidence; injury scale; preschool child; sex ratio; very elderly; visual acuity; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Eye Injuries; Female; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Trauma Severity Indices; Visual Acuity; Young Adult"
"Overall benefits provided by orthopedic surgical intervention in patients with rheumatoid arthritis",2019,"Objectives: To clarify systemic effects of orthopedic surgical intervention in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods: A prospective observational cohort study was performed in RA patients who were scheduled to have primary elective orthopedic surgeries. Assessments were performed at baseline, 6 and 12 months after surgery using J-HAQ, General Health, EQ-5D, BDI-II, DAS28-CRP(4) and CRP for all registered patients, DASH and grip power for patients with upper-extremity surgeries, TUG for patients with lower-extremity surgeries, and JSSF for patients with ankle and forefoot surgeries. Results: There were 294 sites in 276 patients whose average age was 64 (19–89) years and average disease duration was 16 (1–60) years. Surgical site was shoulder in six patients, elbow in 26, wrist in 74, hand in 63, hip in 13, knee in 50, ankle in 12, and forefoot in 50. In total, physical function (J-HAQ, grip power, DASH, TUG, JSSF), quality of life (J-HAQ, General Health, EQ-5D) and depression (BDI-II) improved and disease activity (CRP, DAS28-CRP(4)) decreased significantly 6 and 12 months after surgery (p<.01), despite some differences in their outcomes by the preoperative disease activity and the surgical site.

"Intestinal obstruction caused by small bowel adenocarcinoma misdiagnosed as psychogenic disorder",2019,"We describe a case of intestinal obstruction caused by a small bowel adenocarcinoma misdiagnosed as psychogenic disorder. A woman in her 40s was admitted to Nagoya City University Hospital with fatigue, anorexia, nausea and vomiting. CT, oesophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy revealed no signs of organic abnormality in her gastrointestinal tract. As the patient had previously been diagnosed with and treated for depression, her symptoms were suspected to be due to psychogenic disorder. Therefore, she was diagnosed with severe depression and was administered antidepressant agents. Despite intense psychiatric treatment, her symptoms worsened and she was later diagnosed with ileus due to adenocarcinoma in the jejunum. After drainage by insertion of a transnasal decompression tube, a partial jejunum resection was performed. After the resection, the patient's symptoms including fatigue and depression resolved without the use of antidepressant agents. ? 2019 BMJ Publishing Group Limited.","antidepressant agent; enema; iron; adenocarcinoma; adult; anemia; anorexia; Article; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; consciousness disorder; dehydration; depression; diagnostic error; disease exacerbation; disease severity; double balloon enteroscopy; DSM-5; electrolyte disturbance; fatigue; female; fluid therapy; follow up; Global Assessment of Functioning; histopathology; hospital admission; hospital discharge; human; human tissue; hypoalbuminemia; hypoproteinemia; hypovolemic shock; ileus; intestine biopsy; intestine obstruction; intestine resection; Japan; jejunum cancer; laboratory test; malnutrition; medical history; nausea and vomiting; priority journal; small intestine carcinoma; surgical drainage; treatment duration; treatment outcome; university hospital; uterus myoma; adenocarcinoma; complication; diagnostic error; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; intestine obstruction; jejunum tumor; major depression; middle aged; procedures; small intestine; x-ray computed tomography; Adenocarcinoma; Depressive Disorder, Major; Diagnosis, Differential; Diagnostic Errors; Female; Humans; Intestinal Obstruction; Intestine, Small; Jejunal Neoplasms; Middle Aged; Tomography, X-Ray Computed"
"Development of twist-correction system for radiotherapy of head and neck cancer patients",2019,"To propose a concept for correcting the twist between the head and neck and the body frequently occurring in radiotherapy patients and to develop a prototype device for achieving this. Furthermore, the operational accuracy of this device under no load was evaluated. We devised a concept for correcting the twist of patients by adjustment of the three rotation (pitch, roll, and yaw) angles in two independent plates connected by a joint (fulcrum). The two plates (head and neck plate and body plate) rotate around the fulcrum by adjusting screws under each of them. A prototype device was created to materialize this concept. First, after all adjusting screws were set to the zero position, the rotation angle of each plate was measured by a digital goniometer. Repeatability was evaluated by performing 20 repeated measurements. Next, to confirm the rotational accuracy of each plate of the prototype device, the calculated rotation angles for 20 combinations of patterns of traveled distances of the adjusting screws were compared with those measured by the digital goniometer and cone-beam computed tomography (CT). The repeatability (standard deviation: SD) of the pitch, roll, and yaw angles of the head and neck plate was 0.04°, 0.05°, and 0.03°, and the repeatability (SD) of the body plate was 0.05°, 0.04°, and 0.04°, respectively. The mean differences?±?SD between the calculated and measured pitch, roll, and yaw angles for the head and neck plate with the digital goniometer were 0.00?±?0.06°, ?0.01?±?0.06°, and ?0.04?±?0.04°, respectively. The differences for the body plate were ?0.03?±?0.04°, 0.03?±?0.05°, and 0.02?±?0.05°, respectively. Results of the cone-beam CT were similar to those of the digital goniometer. The prototype device exhibited good performance regarding the rotational accuracy and repeatability under no load. The clinical implementation of this concept is expected to reduce the residual error of the patient position due to the twist. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Mitral valve repair for a patient with presternal esophageal reconstruction",2019,"A 68-year-old man presented with dyspnea and pulsation. He had a history of esophagectomy and presternal gastric tube reconstruction for esophageal cancer 1 year earlier. Electrocardiography revealed atrial fibrillation, and an echocardiogram showed severe mitral valve regurgitation and moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation. He underwent mitral valve repair, tricuspid valve annuloplasty, and isolation of bilateral pulmonary veins via a standard median sternotomy. The mitral and tricuspid valves were evaluated by epicardial echocardiography, and both valves were successfully repaired. The postoperative course was uneventful.

"Long-term outcomes of one stage surgery using transanal colorectal tube for acute colorectal obstruction of stage II/III distal colon cancer",2019,"Purpose Since oncological outcomes of transanal colorectal tube (TCT) placement, an endoscopic treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC) with acute colorectal obstruction (ACO), remain unknown, this study analyzed long-term outcomes of TCT placement for stage II/III CRC with ACO. Materials and Methods Data were retrospectively reviewed from consecutive patients with distal stage II/III CRC who underwent surgery between January 2007 and December 2011 at two Japanese hospitals. One hospital conducted emergency surgery and the other performed TCT placement as the standard treatment for all CRCs with ACO. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to adjust baseline characteristics between two groups. Results Among 754 patients with distal stage II/III CRC, 680 did not have ACO (non-ACO group) and 74 had ACO (ACO group). The PS matching between both hospitals identified 234 pairs in the non-ACO group and 23 pairs in the ACO group. In the non-ACO group, the surgical quality was equivalent between the two institutions, with no significant differences in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). In the ACO group, the rate of primary resection/anastomosis was higher in the TCT group than in the surgery group (87.0% vs. 26.1%, p < 0.001). No significant differences were noted between the surgery and the TCT groups in OS (5-year OS, 61.9% vs. 51.5%; p=0.490) and DFS (5-year DFS, 45.9% vs. 38.3%; p=0.658). Conclusion TCT placement can achieve similar long-term outcomes to emergency surgery, with a high rate of primary resection/anastomosis for distal stage II/III colon cancer with ACO.

"Peripheral Microvascular Abnormalities Detected by Wide-Field Fluorescein Angiography in Eyes with Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion",2019,"Purpose: To evaluate the location of microvascular abnormalities using wide-field fluorescein angiography (WFFA) and investigate the impact on visual outcome in eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). Methods: Forty eyes of 39 patients (24 males and 15 females with an average age of 71 years) were retrospectively reviewed. One patient had BRVO bilaterally. WFFA was performed in all patients to evaluate perfusion status and detect microvascular abnormalities. The WFFA images were divided into 3 zones: zone 1, posterior pole; zone 2, mid-periphery; zone 3, far periphery, in order to document the presence of microvascular abnormalities. Scatter retinal photocoagulation (PC) was performed for retinal neovascularization (NV) and/or widespread nonperfused areas (NPAs). Results: The incidence of microvascular abnormalities in zone 3 was significantly (p < 0.0001) less than in zones 1 and 2. The presence of larger NPAs in zone 1, but not in zone 3, was associated with the incidence of NV and vitreous hemorrhage. The presence of peripheral lesions and the application of PC did not affect the visual outcome. Conclusion: The presence of peripheral abnormalities or scatter PC for NPAs did not affect the visual outcome in eyes with BRVO. ? 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

"Moringa peregrina Leaves Extracts Induce Apoptosis and Cell Cycle Arrest of Hepatocellular Carcinoma",2019,"Moringa grows in the tropical and subtropical regions of the world. The genus Moringa belongs to family Moringaceae. It is found to possess various medicinal uses including hypoglycemic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, hypolipidemic, and antioxidant activities. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial and the anticancer activity of the Moringa peregrina as well as Moringa oleifera leaves extracts grown locally in Egypt. Results indicated that most of the extracts were found to possess high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungus. The survival rate of cancer cells was decreased in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines when treated with Moringa leaves extracts. In addition, the cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cancer-related genes confirmed its anticancer effect. The toxicity of each extract was also tested using the normal melanocytes cell line HFB4. The toxicity was low in both Moringa peregrina and Moringa oleifera leaves extracts. Furthermore, GC/MS analysis fractionized the phytochemicals content for each potential extract. In conclusion, results suggested that the Moringa peregrina and Moringa oleifera leaves extracts possess antimicrobial and anticancer properties which could be attributed to the bioactive phytochemical compounds present inside the extracts from this plant. These findings can be used to develop new drugs, especially for liver cancer chemotherapy. ? 2019 Mohamed Mansour et al.","ampicillin; antineoplastic agent; doxorubicin; fluorouracil; gentamicin; Moringa peregrina extract; nystatin; plant extract; unclassified drug; antiinfective agent; antineoplastic agent; antioxidant; phytochemical; plant extract; antifungal activity; antimicrobial activity; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; breast carcinoma; Candida albicans; cell cycle arrest; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle S phase; controlled study; cytotoxicity; DNA content; Escherichia coli; flow cytometry; gene expression; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; Klebsiella pneumoniae; liver cell carcinoma; mass fragmentography; MCF-7 cell line; Moringa; Moringa oleifera; Moringa peregrina; plant leaf; proapoptotic activity; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus mutans; survival rate; tumor suppressor gene; apoptosis; breast tumor; cell cycle checkpoint; chemistry; drug effect; female; liver; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; Moringa; tumor cell line; Anti-Infective Agents; Antineoplastic Agents; Antioxidants; Apoptosis; Breast Neoplasms; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Female; Hep G2 Cells; Humans; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; MCF-7 Cells; Moringa; Phytochemicals; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves"
"Optimal Timing of Cabazitaxel Introduction for Japanese Patients with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer",2019,"Background/Aim: Limited information is available to help physicians decide when to introduce cabazitaxel for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) patients. The objective of this study was to assess the optimal timing of cabazitaxel introduction. Patients and Methods: The clinical outcomes of 66 mCRPC patients receiving cabazitaxel following failure of docetaxel were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the parameters possibly affecting the timing of cabazitaxel introduction, only an increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value from the diagnosis of CRPC had a significant impact on overall survival (OS) after the introduction of cabazitaxel. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the increased PSA value from the diagnosis of CRPC and the baseline PSA value at cabazitaxel introduction. Multivariate analysis showed that only the baseline PSA value at cabazitaxel introduction is an independent predictor of OS. Conclusion: A comparatively low PSA value could be an alternative index suggesting the optimal timing for cabazitaxel introduction. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Acquisition of gemcitabine resistance enhances angiogenesis via upregulation of IL?8 production in pancreatic cancer",2019,"Gemcitabine (Gem) is widely used as chemotherapy for pancreatic cancer (PaCa), but its effect is not fully satisfactory. One of the reasons for this is the acquisition of Gem resistance (Gem-R). To elucidate the mechanism of Gem-R, two Gem-R PaCa cell lines were established from AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. It was demonstrated that expression of interleukin?8 (IL?8) mRNA was significantly upregulated in Gem-R PaCa cells by cDNA microarray and RT-qPCR analyses. Increased IL?8 secretion by Gem?R cells was confirmed by cytokine array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, we found that co-culture with Gem-R PaCa cells significantly enhanced tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and treatment with an anti-CXCR2 (main receptor for IL?8) antibody significantly prevented this effect. We previously reported that a chemokine network centered on the IL-8/CXCR2 axis plays an important role in PaCa angiogenesis, and suppression of this axis has an antitumor effect. Since acquisition of Gem-R increased IL-8 production and consequently increased tumor angiogenesis, the IL-8/CXCR2 axis may be a potential novel therapeutic target for PaCa after acquiring Gem-R. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Long-term influence of adjuvant breast radiotherapy on cognitive function in breast cancer patients treated with conservation therapy",2019,"Background: The mechanisms underlying cognitive decline after radiotherapy not directed at brain areas remains unclear. We previously suggested that adjuvant breast radiotherapy in breast conservation therapy could lower memory function soon after therapy, and that the process might be partially mediated by plasma interleukin (IL)-6 levels. The present study investigated how that relationship changes longitudinally. Methods: We performed the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) test and measured plasma IL-6 levels for 47 breast cancer surgical patients within 1?year after the initial therapy (study 1) and more than 2?years after study 1 (study 2). We also performed 2 × 2 mixed [the radiotherapy group (n = 25) or the no-radiotherapy group (n = 22) × study 1 or study 2] analysis of covariance on the WMS-R indices and plasma IL-6 levels. The association between changes in plasma IL-6 levels and changes in the WMS-R indices between the two studies was evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: The Immediate Verbal Memory Index was significantly higher in study 2. The Delayed Recall Index was significantly higher in study 2 and significantly lower in the radiotherapy group only in study 1. There was a significant correlation between changes in plasma IL-6 levels and changes only in the Delayed Recall Index of the WMS-R. Conclusions: Memory decline in breast cancer patients soon after adjuvant breast radiotherapy was restored approximately 3?years after treatment, and decreased plasma IL-6 levels might be involved in the recovery process. ? 2018, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.","interleukin 6; interleukin 6; tumor marker; adjuvant radiotherapy; adult; Article; attention; breast cancer; breast radiotherapy; breast surgery; cancer patient; cancer surgery; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; longitudinal study; memory; memory disorder; middle aged; priority journal; protein blood level; radiation injury; recall; surgical patient; verbal memory; visual memory; Wechsler memory scale; adjuvant radiotherapy; adolescent; blood; breast tumor; cognition; partial mastectomy; pathology; procedures; radiation response; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Cognition; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Longitudinal Studies; Mastectomy, Segmental; Memory; Middle Aged; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Time Factors; Young Adult"
"Identification of new urinary risk markers for urinary stones using a logistic model and multinomial logit model",2019,"Background: Risk assessment for urinary stones has been mainly based on urinary biochemistry. We attempted to identify the risk factors for urinary stones by statistically analyzing urinary biochemical and inflammation-related factors. Methods: Male participants (age, 20–79?years) who visited Nagoya City University Hospital were divided into three groups: a control group (n = 48) with no history of stones and two stone groups with calcium oxalate stone experience (first-time group, n = 22; recurring group, n = 40). Using 25-?L spot urine samples, we determined the concentrations of 18 candidate urinary proteins, using multiplex analysis on a MagPix? system. Results: In univariate logistic regression models classifying the control and first-time groups, interleukin (IL)-1a and IL-4 were independent factors, with significantly high areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (1.00 and 0.87, respectively, P < 0.01 for both). The multivariate models with IL-4 and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) showed higher areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.93) compared to that for the univariate model with IL-4. In the classification of control, first-time, and recurrence groups, accuracy was the highest for the multinomial logit model with IL-4, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10, and urinary magnesium (concordance rate 82.6%). Conclusions: IL-4, IL-1a, GM-CSF, IL-1b, and IL-10 were identified as urinary inflammation-related factors that could accurately distinguish control individuals from patients with urinary stones. Thus, the combined analysis of urinary biochemical data could provide an index that more clearly evaluates the risk of urinary stone formation. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Nephrology.","biochemical marker; epidermal growth factor; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; magnesium; melanoma growth stimulatory activity factor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; platelet derived growth factor AA; platelet derived growth factor BB; RANTES; tumor necrosis factor; biological marker; interleukin derivative; accuracy; adult; aged; Article; calcium oxalate stone; controlled study; human; limit of detection; logistic regression analysis; magnesium urine level; major clinical study; male; protein urine level; recurrent disease; risk assessment; statistical model; urine sampling; urolithiasis; case control study; middle aged; urine; urolithiasis; young adult; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Interleukins; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Urinary Calculi; Young Adult"
"Small interfering RNA screening for the small GTPase rab proteins identifies Rab5B as a major regulator of hepatitis B virus production",2019,"IMPORTANCE HBV infection is a worldwide health problem, but the mechanisms of how HBV utilizes cellular machinery for its life cycle are poorly understood. In particular, it has been unclear how the viral components and virions are transported among the organelles. The HBV budding site has been reported to be the ER or MVB, but it has not been clearly determined. In this study, siRNA-based screening of Rab proteins using HBV-expressing cells showed that Rab5B, one of the Rab5 isoforms, has important roles in late steps of the HBV life cycle. Although Rab5 is known to work on early endosomes, this study showed that Rab5B plays a role in the transport of LHBs between the ER and MVB. Furthermore, it affects the transcription of LHBs. This is the first report on the mechanisms of HBV envelope protein transport among the organelles, and the results provide important insights into the therapeutic control of HBV infection.Viruses are considered to use vesicular trafficking in infected cells, but the details of assembly/release pathways of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are still unknown. To identify key regulators of HBV production, we performed short interfering RNA (siRNA) screening for Rab proteins, which are considered to act as molecular switches in vesicular trafficking using HepG2.2.15 cells. Among 62 Rab proteins, the suppression of Rab5B most significantly increased HBV DNA in the culture supernatant. Surprisingly, 5 days after the transfection of Rab5B siRNA, HBV DNA in the supernatant was increased more than 30-fold, reflecting the increase of infectious HBV particles. Northern blotting showed that transcription of 2.4/2.1-kb mRNA coding envelope proteins containing large hepatitis B surface protein (LHBs) was increased. Analysis of hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) showed that transcription of HNF4, which is known to enhance 2.4-kb mRNA transcription, was regulated by Rab5B. Also, it was revealed that LHBs had accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after Rab5B depletion but not in the multivesicular body (MVB), which is thought to be an organelle utilized for HBV envelope formation. Therefore, it was considered that Rab5B is required for the transport of LHBs from the ER to MVB. Immunofluorescent microscopy showed that HBs proteins, including LHBs, colocalized with HBc in the ER of Rab5B-depleted cells, suggesting that HBV envelopment occurs not only in the MVB but also in the ER. In conclusion, Rab5B is a key regulator of HBV production and could be a target of antiviral therapy. Copyright ? 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

"Benefits of cooperation among large-scale cohort studies and human biomonitoring projects in environmental health research: An exercise in blood lead analysis of the Environment and Child Health International Birth Cohort Group",2019,"A number of prospective cohort studies are ongoing worldwide to investigate the impact of foetal and neonatal exposures to chemical substances on child health. To assess multiple exposure (mixture) effects and low prevalence health outcomes it is useful to pool data from several studies and conduct mega-data-analysis. To discuss a path towards data harmonization, representatives from several large-scale birth cohort studies and a biomonitoring programme formed a collaborative group, the Environment and Child Health International Birth Cohort Group (ECHIBCG). In this study, an intra-laboratory trial was performed to harmonize existing blood lead measurements within the groups' studies. Then, decentralized analyses were conducted in individual countries' laboratories to evaluate blood lead levels (BLL) in each study. The measurements of pooled BLL samples in French, German and three Japanese laboratories resulted in an overall mean blood lead concentration of 8.66 μg l?1 (95% confidence interval: 8.59–8.72 μg l?1) with 3.0% relative standard deviation. Except for China's samples, BLL from each study were comparable with mean concentrations below or close to 10 μg l?1. The decentralized multivariate analyses revealed that all models had coefficients of determination below 0.1. Determinants of BLL were current smoking, age &gt;35 years and overweight or obese status. The three variables were associated with an increase in BLL in each of the five studies, most strongly in France by almost 80% and the weakest effect being in Norway with only 15%; for Japan, with the far largest sample (~18,000), the difference was 36%. This study successfully demonstrated that the laboratory analytical methods were sufficiently similar to allow direct comparison of data and showed that it is possible to harmonize the epidemiological data for joint analysis. This exercise showed the challenges in decentralized data analyses and reinforces the need for data harmonization among studies. ? 2019 The Authors",""
"Fiber intake and the risk of head and neck cancer in the prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian (PLCO) cohort",2019,"Although the protective role of dietary fiber on cancer risk has been reported in several epidemiological studies, the association of fiber intake on head and neck cancer (HNC) risk is still unclear. We investigated the association between fiber intake and the risk of HNC using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial. Among 101,700 participants with complete dietary information, 186 participants developed HNC during follow-up (January 1998 to May 2011). Dietary data were collected using a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire (1998–2005). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), using the Cox proportional hazards model. Higher intake of total fiber, insoluble fiber and soluble fiber was associated with decreased HNC risks, with a significant trend. The HRs of highest vs. the lowest tertile of intake were 0.43 (95%CI: 0.25–0.76) for total fiber, 0.38 (95%CI: 0.22–0.65) for insoluble fiber, and 0.44 (95%CI: 0.25–0.79) for soluble fiber. These inverse association were consistent in oral cavity and pharyngeal cases, but the impact of fiber intake was weaker in laryngeal cases. We did not observe any significant interaction of potential confounders, including smoking and drinking, with total fiber intake on HNC risk. These findings support evidence of a protective role of dietary fiber on HNC risk. ? 2019 UICC","adult; age distribution; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; body mass; cancer risk; cigarette smoking; colorectal cancer; dietary fiber; educational status; female; fruit; gender; head and neck cancer; high fiber diet; human; low fiber diet; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; marriage; ovary cancer; priority journal; prostate cancer; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; vegetable; very elderly; administration and dosage; clinical trial (topic); dietary fiber; follow up; middle aged; mouth tumor; multicenter study (topic); nutrition; pharynx cancer; proportional hazards model; prospective study; self report; Aged; Clinical Trials as Topic; Dietary Fiber; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Multicenter Studies as Topic; Nutrition Surveys; Pharyngeal Neoplasms; Proportional Hazards Models; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Self Report"
"Effects of a disease management program for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke: A randomized controlled study",2019,"Background and Purpose - Disease management is a healthcare strategy that includes self-management education and treatment coordination. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether a disease management program intervention could improve risk factor profiles and, thus, reduce the recurrence of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. Methods - This study is a prospective randomized, open-label, parallel group study involving outpatients with a history of stroke. Between September 2010 and November 2012, we enrolled patients aged between 40 and 80 years who experienced their last ischemic stroke event or transient ischemic attack within 1 year. After stratifying by the ischemic stroke subtype, 321 subjects (67.5±8.5 years, 95 female) were randomly assigned to either the disease management program intervention group (n=156) or the usual care group (n=165). The primary end point of this study was the difference in the Framingham risk score (general cardiovascular disease 10-year risk) from baseline. The secondary end points of this study included stroke recurrence, onset of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and all vascular events. Results - Regarding the primary end point, there was no significant difference in the changes in the Framingham risk score at any follow-up time between the groups. The incidence of stroke recurrence tended to be lower in the disease management program intervention group, although no significant difference was found (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.19-1.29). Conclusions - We were unable to demonstrate a clear benefit of disease management program intervention. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.","anticoagulant agent; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; brain ischemia; cardiovascular risk; caregiver; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; female; follow up; Framingham risk score; general practitioner; human; major clinical study; male; outpatient; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; risk factor; self care; transient ischemic attack; bioassay; brain ischemia; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; complication; disease management; middle aged; mortality; secondary prevention; transient ischemic attack; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Ischemia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Disease Management; Endpoint Determination; Female; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Secondary Prevention; Stroke"
"A genome-wide association study of coping behaviors suggests FBXO45 is associated with emotional expression",2019,"Individuals use coping behaviors to deal with unpleasant daily events. Such behaviors can moderate or mediate the pathway between psychosocial stress and health-related outcomes. However, few studies have examined the associations between coping behaviors and genetic variants. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on coping behaviors in 14088 participants aged 35 to 69 years as part of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Five coping behaviors (emotional expression, emotional support seeking, positive reappraisal, problem solving and disengagement) were measured and analyzed. A GWAS analysis was performed using a mixed linear model adjusted for study area, age and sex. Variants with suggestive significance in the discovery phase (N = 6403) were further examined in the replication phase (N = 7685). We then combined variant-level association evidence into gene-level evidence using a gene-based analysis. The results showed a significant genetic contribution to emotional expression and disengagement, with an estimation that the 19.5% and 6.6% variance in the liability-scale was explained by common variants. In the discovery phase, 12 variants met suggestive significance (P &lt; 1 × 10 ?6 ) for association with the coping behaviors and perceived stress. However, none of these associations were confirmed in the replication stage. In gene-based analysis, FBXO45, a gene with regulatory roles in synapse maturation, was significantly associated with emotional expression after multiple corrections (P &lt; 3.1 × 10 ?6 ). In conclusion, our results showed the existence of up to 20% genetic contribution to coping behaviors. Moreover, our gene-based analysis using GWAS data suggests that genetic variations in FBXO45 are associated with emotional expression. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society","F box protein; messenger RNA; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; F box protein; FBXO45 protein, human; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; coping behavior; disease association; emotion; FBXO45 gene; female; gene; gene frequency; gene replication; genetic analysis; genetic code; genetic heterogeneity; genetic risk; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; genotype; genotype environment interaction; human; informed consent; Japan; major clinical study; male; medical information; mental stress; phenotype; priority journal; problem solving; protein expression; quality control; questionnaire; reproducibility; self report; single nucleotide polymorphism; social environment; social psychology; genetic polymorphism; genetics; middle aged; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Expressed Emotion; F-Box Proteins; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Genetic"
"Efficient method for isolation of exosomes from raw bovine milk",2019,"Objective: This study aimed to establish a rapid and simple method for isolating exosomes from raw bovine milk and to compare the quality of the isolated exosomes with those isolated by a standard method involving ultracentrifugation (UC). Methods: To remove caseins, which are major milk proteins consisting more than 80% of milk protein (35% in human breast milk) and hamper isolation and purification of exosomes, hydrochloride (HCl) was added to milk for isoelectric precipitation (IP). The effects of acidification on morphological features, particle size distribution, surface charge, and exosome surface proteins were analyzed by electron microscopy, tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), and Western blot (WB) analysis, respectively. Results: Electron microscopy showed that some of the exosomes isolated using IP had rough surfaces; most exosomes were successfully isolated without breakage, and their morphological features were similar to those of exosomes isolated by UC. TRPS showed that their surface charge and peaks (mode) for particle size distribution did not significantly differ between both methods. WB analysis using antibodies against the exosome surface marker proteins–milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) and CD63–revealed that the structures of exosome surface proteins were not affected by adding HCl. Conclusions: IP can be used to remove caseins to reduce operation time. This method will be useful for efficient isolation and purification of bovine milk exosomes and contribute to progression of research on health management of dairy cattle and drug delivery systems in human medicine, which require large amounts of milk exosomes. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","casein; CD63 antigen; chloride; epidermal growth factor; milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8; unclassified drug; biological marker; membrane antigen; milk protein; acidification; Article; cow milk; electron microscopy; exosome; isolation; particle size; precipitation; protein structure; raw milk; surface charge; ultracentrifugation; Western blotting; animal; bovine; chemistry; exosome; milk; procedures; Animals; Antigens, Surface; Biomarkers; Caseins; Cattle; Exosomes; Milk; Milk Proteins; Particle Size; Tetraspanin 30; Ultracentrifugation"
"Consensus guidance of nebulizer therapy for acute rhinosinusitis",2020,"The guidance deals with the recommended applications, procedures, and safety management of nebulizer therapy for acute rhinosinusitis. In Japan, nebulizer therapy for sinusitis has been covered by public health insurance since 1958 and has been commonly carried out nationwide. The Japan Society for Infection and Aerosol in Otorhinolaryngology and the Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan set up a working group to draw up a consensus guidance on nebulizer therapy for acute rhinosinusitis. The device for nebulizer therapy are classified into jet, ultrasound, and mesh types. In Japan, cefmenoxime hydrochloride (CMX) was approved for use in nebulizer therapy since 1996. The widening of the obstructed lesions such as large polyps prior to nebulizer therapy were recommended. The numbers of times of nebulizer therapy is recommended for three times in a week for at least for 2 weeks (cure rate: 68%, eradication ratio: 48%). Concerns should be pay for the changes of activity of medicine due to the mixing and bacterial contamination. Pseudomonas cepacia growing in a short even in both saline and distilled water leads to contamination at high concentrations by 2 days. Nebulizer therapy is an effective treatment based on a drug delivery system (DDS) to the nasal and paranasal cavities. The therapy effectively increases the local drug concentration by promptly and uniformly delivering drugs to a targeted local site. The therapy is safe with less systemic absorption and with few adverse reactions. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V.","alcohol; aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; cefmenoxime; cefuroxime; ciprofloxacin; corticosteroid; disinfectant agent; fosfomycin; levofloxacin; lincomycin; penicillin derivative; polypeptide antibiotic agent; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; tobramycin; vasoconstrictor agent; acute rhinosinusitis; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium contamination; Burkholderia cepacia; chronic rhinosinusitis; concentration (parameter); disinfection; drug activity; drug approval; drug contamination; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug stability; drug storage; equipment design; human; instrument sterilization; Japan; medical society; nebulization; nebulizer therapy; nose cavity; paranasal sinus; practice guideline; public health insurance; safety; treatment duration; treatment indication"
"MWCNT-7 administered to the lung by intratracheal instillation induces development of pleural mesothelioma in F344 rats",2019,"Multi-walled carbon nanotube-7 (MWCNT-7) fibers are biopersistent and have a structure similar to asbestos. MWCNT-7 has been shown to induce malignant mesothelioma when administered by intrascrotal or intraperitoneal injection in rats and mice, and an inhalation study demonstrated that rats exposed to respirable MWCNT-7 developed lung tumors. MWCNT-N, which is similar to MWCNT-7, was shown to induce both lung tumors and malignant mesothelioma in rats when administered by trans-tracheal intrapulmonary spraying (TIPS). The present study was performed to investigate the carcinogenicity of MWCNT-7 when administered by the TIPS method. Ten-week-old male F344/Crj rats were divided into 3 groups and administered 0.5?mL vehicle, 0.250?μg/mL MWCNT-7 or 0.250?μg/mL crocidolite once a week for 12?weeks (total doses of 1.5?mg/rat) and then observed for up to 104?weeks. Rats in the MWCNT-7 group began to die from pathologies associated with the development of malignant mesothelioma 35?weeks after the final TIPS administration. Overall, the incidence of malignant mesothelioma in the MWCNT-7 group was significantly higher than in the vehicle or crocidolite groups. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Pathogenic roles of anti-C1q antibodies in recurrent pregnancy loss",2019,"Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is often considered idiopathic, however excessive complement activation has been observed in pregnancy related manifestations. Anti-C1q antibodies (anti-C1q) are associated with the activation of complement pathway in lupus patients, while it remains unclear in RPL. Firstly, we showed that both the prevalence and titre of anti-C1q were significantly higher in unexplained RPL than in healthy parous individuals. Secondly, we established the murine model of anti-C1q induced pregnancy loss using a monoclonal anti-mouse C1q antibody, JL-1. In mice treated with JL-1, high ratio of pregnancy loss and fetal growth restriction were frequently observed and complement activation occurred. C5a receptor (C5aR) blockade cancelled these pathogenic changes in mice treated with JL-1. In conclusion, our study reveals an association between the prevalence of anti-C1q and RPL. Additionally, our murine model has indicated that anti-C1q can induce reproductive failure, which might be ameliorated by therapy targeting the C5-C5aR axis. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","complement component C1q antibody; complement component C5a receptor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody titer; Article; complement activation; cross-sectional study; female; human; immunopathogenesis; major clinical study; mouse; nonhuman; prevalence; priority journal; recurrent abortion; retrospective study"
"A novel method for stabilizing microRNA mimics",2019,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small non-coding RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at post-transcriptional level via translational repression and/or mRNA degradation. miRNAs are associated with many cellular processes, and down-regulation of miRNAs causes numerous diseases including cancer, neurological disorders, inflammation, and cardiovascular diseases, for which miRNA replacement therapy has emerged as a promising approach. This approach aims to restore down-regulated miRNAs using synthetic miRNA mimics. However, it remains a critical issue that miRNA mimics are unstable and transient in cells. Here, we first show that miRNA mimics are rapidly degraded by a mechanism different from Tudor-staphylococcal/micrococcal-like nuclease (TSN)-mediated miRNA decay, which degrades endogenous miRNAs, and newly identified 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L as key factors responsible for the degradation of miRNA mimics in human cells. Our results suggest that the OAS1 recognizes miRNA mimics and produces 2′-5′-oligoadenylates (2–5A), which leads to the activation of latent endoribonuclease RNase L to degrade miRNA mimics. A small-molecule inhibitor that blocks RNase L can stabilize miRNA mimics. These findings provide a promising method for the stabilization of miRNA mimics, as well as for the efficient miRNA replacement therapy. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.","2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase 1; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase 2; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase 3; microRNA; ribonuclease L; unclassified drug; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase; 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease; microRNA; OAS1 protein, human; ribonuclease; Article; controlled study; down regulation; human; human cell; in vitro study; Northern blotting; oligomerization; priority journal; protein RNA binding; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA degradation; RNA stability; chemistry; HeLa cell line; metabolism; RNA stability; 2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase; Endoribonucleases; HeLa Cells; Humans; MicroRNAs; RNA Stability"
"GWAS analysis reveals a significant contribution of PSCA to the risk of Heliobacter pylori-induced gastric atrophy",2019,"Although recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified genetic variants associated with Helicobacter pylori (HP)-induced gastric cancer, few studies have examined the genetic traits associated with the risk of HP-induced gastric precancerous conditions. This study aimed to elucidate genetic variants associated with these conditions using a genome-wide approach. Data from four sites of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study were used in the discovery phase (Stage I); two datasets from the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center 2 (HERPACC2) study were used in the replication phases (Stages II and III) and SKAT (SNP-set Kernel Association Test) and single variant-based GWASs were conducted for the risks of gastric atrophy (GA) and severe GA defined by serum pepsinogen (PG) levels, and PG1 and PG1/2 ratios. In the gene-based SKAT in Stage I, prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) was significantly associated with the risks of GA and severe GA, and serum PG1/2 level by linear kernel [false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.011, 0.230 and 7.2 × 10-7, respectively]. The single variant-based GWAS revealed that nine PSCA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fulfilled the genome-wide significance level (P &lt; 5 × 10-8) for the risks of both GA and severe GA in the combined study, although most of these associations did not reach genome-wide significance in the discovery or validation cohort on their own. GWAS for serum PG1 levels and PG1/2 ratios revealed that the PSCA rs2920283 SNP had a striking P-value of 4.31 × 10-27 for PG1/2 ratios. The present GWAS revealed the genetic locus of PSCA as the most significant locus for the risk of HP-induced GA, which confirmed the recently reported association in Europeans. ? 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

"Prevention of Metabolic Syndrome by Telephone-Delivered Lifestyle Intervention in a Real-World Setting: Sub-Analysis of a Cluster-Randomized Trial",2019,"Background: Evidence of the long-term benefits of telephone-delivered lifestyle interventions is limited. This study investigated the ability of telephone-delivered lifestyle intervention to reduce the incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in subjects diagnosed with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) during health checkups. Methods: Our subjects were participants in the Japan Diabetes Outcome Intervention Trial-1 (J-DOIT1), a prospective, cluster-randomized controlled trial designed to investigate whether goal-focused lifestyle coaching over the telephone can effectively reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes development in high-risk individuals in a primary health care setting. We extracted 753 and 844 J-DOIT1 participants from the intervention and controls arms, respectively, who had IFG but did not meet the MetS criteria at baseline. The intervention arm received goal-focused lifestyle support delivered by health care providers via telephone over a 1-year period. The endpoint was the development of incident MetS, defined based on the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria modified for Japan. Results: During the median follow-up period of 4.9 years, 8.0% of the intervention arm and 12.0% of the control arm developed MetS. Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) for the development of MetS was 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-1.09; P = 0.14] in the intervention arm. However, the HR in overweight or obese [body mass index (BMI) ?23 kg/m2] individuals was significantly reduced to 0.63 (95% CI, 0.41-0.95; P = 0.029), but not in lean (BMI &lt;23 kg/m2) individuals.

"Methanol extract of Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx fruit has antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against Streptococcus pyogenes in vitro",2019,"Streptococcus pyogenes causes several infectious diseases such as tonsillitis, cellulitis, and streptococcal toxic shock syndrome. As antibiotics are used for the general treatment of S. pyogenes infection, cases of treatment failure due to drug-resistant bacteria have increased. Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx (LCE) has been used as a folk medicine in northern Japan (Hokkaido). In this study, we investigated the antibacterial effect of methanol extracts of the fruit, stem, and leaf of LCE (LCEEs) against S. pyogenes using disk diffusion assay. As LCEE (fruit) had the strongest antibacterial activity among the three LCEEs, we focused on functional analysis of antibacterial effects of LCEE (fruit). LCEE (fruit) suppressed the growth of S. pyogenes in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that LCEE (fruit) damaged the shape of S. pyogenes. Microplate and confocal laser microscopy analysis showed that biofilm formation was also suppressed by LCEE (fruit) in a dose-dependent manner. To further evaluate the surface structure of these biofilms, we performed hydrophobic analysis, which demonstrated that LCEE (fruit) reduced the hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface structure. Our data demonstrated that LCEE (fruit) had anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm effects on S. pyogenes in vitro, suggesting that the direct anti-bacterial effects of the LCEE (fruit) may be useful for treatment of local S. pyogenes infection. ? 2019, International Advancement Center for Medicine and Health Research Co., Ltd.","antiinfective agent; methanol; plant extract; biofilm; chemical phenomena; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; fruit; growth, development and aging; Lonicera; microbial sensitivity test; physiology; plant leaf; plant stem; Streptococcus pyogenes; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Biofilms; Fruit; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Lonicera; Methanol; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Plant Stems; Streptococcus pyogenes"
"Can the Sarcoidosis Health Questionnaire predict the long-term outcomes in Japanese sarcoidosis patients?",2019,"Rationale: The Sarcoidosis Health Questionnaire (SHQ) is the first sarcoidosis-specific health status questionnaire ever developed. Worse health status, as evaluated by the SHQ, may indicate higher risk for deterioration in the following 5 years. Objectives: To evaluate the association between SHQ scores and deterioration defined clinically at 5-year follow-up. Methods: 122 patients with biopsy-supported sarcoidosis completed the SHQ and underwent evaluation with respect to organ involvement, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, serum biomarker measurements, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram. Of these 122, 88 (72.1%) were available for pulmonary, cardiac, and non-pulmonary, non-cardiac deterioration assessment during the following 5 years. Measurements and main results: Five-year deterioration was observed in 20 patients (23%). The SHQ total score was significantly associated with 5-year deterioration, after adjusting for cardiac involvement at baseline, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.54 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.29–0.99). The association of the total SHQ with 5-year outcome was not significant when adjusted for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline (adjusted OR, 0.61 [0.32–1.16]), whereas LVEF was significantly associated with 5-year outcome (adjusted OR, 0.92 [0.86–0.99]). The association between total SHQ score and 5-year deterioration was marginal when adjusted for baseline usage of systemic corticosteroid (CS)/immunosuppressive (IS) agents (adjusted OR, 0.58 [0.31–1.10]), whereas systemic CS/IS usage significantly predicted 5-year deterioration (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.46 [1.12–10.7]). There was a marginal correlation between the total SHQ and LVEF (rho = 0.19, p = 0.07) and a weak association between the total SHQ and systemic CS/IS usage (rho = ?0.23, p = 0.03). The Physical Functioning domain scores of the SHQ were significantly associated with 5-year deterioration (adjusted OR, 0.45–0.51). Conclusions: Worse health status, as assessed by the SHQ score, can be a risk factor for 5-year deterioration of sarcoidosis, although usage of the CS/IS at baseline and lower LVEF at baseline are more predictive of 5-year deterioration. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd","biological marker; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; immunosuppressive agent; soluble interleukin 2 receptor; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical feature; corticosteroid therapy; electrocardiogram; female; follow up; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; health status; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; lung function test; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; questionnaire; sarcoidosis; sarcoidosis health questionnaire; Short Form 36; St. George Respiratory Questionnaire; systemic therapy; thorax radiography"
"The immunostimulatory effects and chemical characteristics of heated honey",2019,"Ethnopharmacological relevance: In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), honey has been used as an additive in the heat-processing of herbal medicines to enhance their immunostimulatory activities. Aim of the study: We investigated the immunostimulatory activity of heated honey in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods: For the in vitro study, we compared the differences among the inducible effects of honey subjected to various heating conditions on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) secretion from the cultured enterocytes and investigated the active ingredient. For the in vivo study, we conducted a survival test of mice infected by Streptococcus pyogenes with and without oral administration of heated honey. Results: We found that heating the honey induced the appearance of G-CSF secretions from the cultured enterocytes, and that this appearance depended on the heating temperature and time. No G-CSF secretions appeared when honey was not heated. Mice infected with Streptococcus pyogenes that were fed heated honey revealed prolonged survival. The active ingredient in heated honey was a high-molecular compound with about 730 kDa. When this compound was hydrolyzed, galactose, glucose, rhamnose, α-ribofuranose β-ribofuranose 1,5′:1′,5-dianhydride, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were generated. Conclusions: Heated honey reveals immunostimulatory activity both in vitro and in vivo. These results support the scientific evidences of the TCM theory. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","5 hydroxymethylfurfural; alpha ribofuranose; animal extract; beta ribofuranose; galactose; glucose; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; honey extract; hot water; rhamnose; unclassified drug; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; immunological adjuvant; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; controlled study; female; group A streptococcal infection; heating; honey; hydrolysis; immunostimulation; in vivo study; intestine cell; male; mouse; nonhuman; skin infection; temperature; analysis; animal; cell line; Chinese medicine; drug effect; heat; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; phytotherapy; skin disease; Streptococcus infection; Streptococcus pyogenes; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Animals; Cell Line; Enterocytes; Female; Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor; Honey; Hot Temperature; Male; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Mice, Inbred ICR; Phytotherapy; Skin Diseases; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes"
"Long-term outcomes of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery lobectomy vs. thoracotomy lobectomy for stage IA non-small cell lung cancer",2019,"Objectives: Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) lobectomy is performed widely for patients with clinical stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) because of its superior short-term outcomes to those of thoracotomy lobectomy. However, the long-term outcomes of VATS lobectomy vs. thoracotomy lobectomy remain controversial. Methods: We reviewed the clinical data of 202 consecutive patients who underwent lobectomy for clinical stage IA NSCLC at our institution between January, 2008 and December, 2013. Stage IA NSCLC was confirmed pathologically in 162 of these patients, 60 of whom underwent VATS lobectomy and 102 of whom underwent thoracotomy lobectomy. We compared the perioperative clinical factors and outcomes of these two groups, using a propensity score-matched analysis. Results: In an analysis of 58 matched cases, the VATS group showed less blood loss, a shorter duration of chest tube placement, a shorter postoperative hospital stay, and a lower peak C-reactive protein value, despite a longer operative time. The VATS group also had significantly longer survival than the thoracotomy group [5-year overall survival, 100% vs. 87%, respectively (p = 0.01); 5-year disease-free survival, 100% vs. 86% (p = 0.03)]. Conclusions: These findings suggest that VATS may have better long-term as well as short-term outcomes than thoracotomy for patients with early-stage NSCLC. ? 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","antineoplastic agent; C reactive protein; loxoprofen; ropivacaine; C reactive protein; adult; aged; Article; atelectasis; atrial fibrillation; brain metastasis; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer staging; cancer survival; chylothorax; controlled study; disease free survival; empyema; female; follow up; hoarseness; hospitalization; human; hypoxia; intermethod comparison; lobectomy; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; mediastinum metastasis; non small cell lung cancer; operation duration; outcome assessment; overall survival; pneumonia; postoperative care; postoperative delirium; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative infection; postoperative pain; smoking; surgical approach; thoracotomy; tumor volume; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; wound infection; length of stay; lung resection; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; procedures; propensity score; survival rate; thoracotomy; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; C-Reactive Protein; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Humans; Length of Stay; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Operative Time; Pneumonectomy; Propensity Score; Survival Rate; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Thoracotomy; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Intracranial vascular calcification with extensive white matter changes in an autopsy case of pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism",2019,"We herein report an autopsy case of a 69-year-old man with pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism. The patient suffered from mental retardation and spastic tetraparesis and had all the features of Albright's hereditary osteodystrophy with a normal response to parathyroid hormone in the Ellsworth–Howard test. Computed tomography demonstrated symmetrical massive brain calcification involving the bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, dentate nuclei and cerebral gray/white matter junctions, which was consistent with Fahr's syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive white matter changes sparing the corpus callosum. Severe ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine was also demonstrated. A neuropathological examination revealed massive intracranial calcification within the walls of the blood vessels and capillaries with numerous calcium deposits. The calcium deposits aligned along the capillaries, and deposits in the vessel wall at the initial stage were confined to the border between the tunica media and adventitia. The vascular calcification in the basal ganglia continuously spread over the surrounding white matter into the cortex. The area of vascular calcification in the white matter was very well correlated with the area of the attenuated myelin staining. Axonal loss, myelin sheath loss and gliosis were observed in the white matter with severe vascular calcification. We should recognize the continuous area of vascular calcification and its correlation with extensive white matter changes as possible causes of neuropsychiatric symptoms in pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism with Fahr's syndrome. ? 2018 Japanese Society of Neuropathology","calcium; cyclic AMP; parathyroid hormone; phosphorus; adult; Albright syndrome; Article; autopsy; basal ganglion; blood vessel calcification; brain; brain hemorrhage; case report; cervical myelopathy; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; corpus callosum; ellsworth howard test; general condition deterioration; human; human tissue; intelligence quotient; ischemia; limb weakness; male; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism; quadriplegia; scoring system; tendon reflex; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; white matter lesion; aged; calcinosis; complication; diagnostic imaging; pathology; pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism; vascularization; white matter; Aged; Brain; Calcinosis; Humans; Male; Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism; White Matter"
"Drug holiday clinical relevance verification for antiresorptive agents in medication-related osteonecrosis cases of the jaw",2020,"Treatment strategies of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) are controversial. Recently, surgical treatment has been reported as superior to nonsurgical treatment, but the contribution discontinued antiresorptive agent use during MRONJ treatment remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of drug holidays and treatment strategies in MRONJ cases. Four-hundred and twenty-seven patients with MRONJ treated at nine hospitals from 2009 to 2017 were included in this multicenter retrospective study. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the primary disease (osteoporosis or malignant tumor), diabetes, serum albumin, and treatment method (surgical or nonsurgical) were significantly correlated with the cure rate. The cumulative 1-year cure rates in the surgical and nonsurgical treatment groups were 64.7% and 18.2%, respectively. However, discontinuing antiresorptive agents did not influence the treatment outcome in the cohort overall, or in 230 patients after performing propensity score matching among the discontinuation and continuation groups. When stratifying by treatment method, antiresorptive agent discontinuation significantly increased the cure rate in patients with osteoporosis who underwent nonsurgical treatment. In patients with malignant tumors undergoing nonsurgical therapy, discontinuing the antiresorptive agent was associated with a better treatment outcome, but not with statistical significance. In contrast, drug holidays showed no effect on improving outcomes in patients with both osteoporosis and malignant tumors who underwent surgical therapy. Thus, regardless of the primary disease, discontinuing antiresorptive agents during treatment for MRONJ may not be necessary and may be helpful in some cases. Future prospective trials should examine this question further. ? 2019, The Japanese Society Bone and Mineral Research and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","agents affecting metabolism; albumin; bisphosphonic acid derivative; denosumab; aged; albumin blood level; Article; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; conservative treatment; diabetes mellitus; drug withdrawal; female; human; jaw osteonecrosis; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; osteoporosis; priority journal; retrospective study; treatment duration; treatment outcome"
"Proton-pump inhibitor-induced fundic gland polyps with hematemesis",2019,"Fundic gland polyps (FGPs) are generally considered benign. Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used worldwide as first-line therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcer treatment. Long-term use of PPIs increases the risk of FGP development. We report an extremely rare case of PPI-induced FGPs with hematemesis. A 37-year-old woman taking daily rabeprazole presented to the hospital with a complaint of hematemesis and tarry stools. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed > 20 pedunculated polyps in the gastric body and fundus. Histological examination showed multiple fragments of fundic gland mucosa with dilated glands. Based on these findings and the clinical history, FGPs were diagnosed. Rabeprazole use was discontinued. Repeat EGD performed 9?months later showed a significant decrease in the number and size of the polyps. FGPs are small polyps typically located in the gastric corpus and fundus. They are commonly reported in patients in their 60s and predominantly in females. We conclude that PPI use is a risk factor for the development of FGPs and hematemesis. ? 2018, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.","beta catenin; gastrin; rabeprazole; proton pump inhibitor; adult; Article; case report; clinical article; colonoscopy; computer assisted tomography; drug withdrawal; esophagogastroduodenoscopy; female; gastrin blood level; gastroesophageal reflux; hematemesis; histology; human; human tissue; priority journal; risk factor; stomach fundus gland; stomach gland polyp; stomach hemorrhage; chemically induced; digestive tract endoscopy; hematemesis; pathology; polyp; stomach fundus; stomach tumor; Adult; Endoscopy, Digestive System; Female; Gastric Fundus; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Hematemesis; Humans; Polyps; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Stomach Neoplasms"
"Kurarinone from Sophora flavescens roots triggers ATF4 activation and cytostatic effects through PERK phosphorylation",2019,"In response to cellular stresses, activating transcriptional factor 4 (ATF4) regulates the expression of both stress-relieving genes and apoptosis-inducing genes, eliciting cell fate determination. Since pharmacological activation of ATF4 exerts potent anti-tumor effects, modulators of ATF4 activation may have potential in cancer therapy. We herein attempted to identify small molecules that activate ATF4. A cell-based screening to monitor TRB3 promoter activation was performed using crude drugs used in traditional Japanese Kampo medicine. We found that an extract from Sophora flavescens roots exhibited potent TRB3 promoter activation. The activity-guided fractionation revealed that kurarinone was identified as the active ingredient. Intriguingly, ATF4 activation in response to kurarinone required PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Moreover, kurarinone induced the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 as well as cytostasis in cancer cells. Importantly, the cytostatic effect of kurarinone was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of PERK. These results indicate that kurarinone triggers ATF4 activation through PERK and exerts cytostatic effects on cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that modulation of the PERK-ATF4 pathway with kurarinone has potential as a cancer treatment. ? 2019 by the authors.","activating transcription factor 4; ATF4 protein, human; cell cycle protein; EIF2AK3 protein, human; flavonoid; kurarinone; protein kinase R; protein serine threonine kinase; repressor protein; TRIB3 protein, human; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug screening; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; HeLa cell line; human; metabolism; phosphorylation; promoter region; Sophora; tumor cell line; Activating Transcription Factor 4; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; eIF-2 Kinase; Flavonoids; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Phosphorylation; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Repressor Proteins; Sophora"
"Helper T-cell signaling and inflammatory pathway lead to formation of calcium phosphate but not calcium oxalate stones on Randall's plaques",2019,"Objectives: To elucidate the difference in the lithogenesis of calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate stones. Methods: Renal papillary tissues were obtained from 23 idiopathic calcium oxalate and seven calcium phosphate stone patients who had undergone endoscopic lithotripsy. Samples were individually collected from two different regions in each patient: the papillary mucosa containing Randall's plaque and mucosa not containing Randall's plaque. A microarray analysis was carried out on those tissues to compare their gene expression patterns. Furthermore, a causal pathway analysis comparing their differences was carried out. Results: Cluster analysis showed that gene expression profiles of calcium phosphate stone patients markedly differed from those of calcium oxalate stone patients. Disease and function analysis showed that Randall's plaque-containing tissues of calcium phosphate stone-forming patients had significantly higher movement and migration of mononuclear leukocytes, and lower tendency toward infection and lymph node formation than Randall's plaque-containing tissues of calcium oxalate stone formers. Additional pathway analysis showed increased immune cell signaling in calcium phosphate formers, such as the helper T?cell 1 and 2 pathways, which was confirmed by their messenger ribonucleic acid expression. Conclusions: The present results show the upregulation of helper T-cell signaling pathways in Randall's plaque-containing papillae in calcium phosphate, but not in calcium oxalate stone formers. Thus, helper T-cell immune responses and the related inflammatory processes seem to lead to the formation of calcium phosphate stones on Randall's plaques. ? 2019 The Japanese Urological Association","calcium oxalate; calcium phosphate; CD28 antigen; CD3 antigen; complementary DNA; inducible T cell costimulator ligand; messenger RNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 2; adult; Article; body mass; calcium oxalate urolithiasis; calcium phosphate urolithiasis; cell structure; cellular immunity; clinical article; controlled study; endoscopic therapy; female; gene expression profiling; helper cell; human; human tissue; hydronephrosis; idiopathic disease; immunocompetent cell; inflammation; kidney papilla; leukocyte migration; lithotripsy; male; microarray analysis; middle aged; mononuclear cell; nephrolithiasis; priority journal; Randall plaque; signal transduction; Th1 cell; Th2 cell"
"TRAFFIC ACCIDENT-RELATED OPEN GLOBE INJURIES",2019,"Purpose:To evaluate the clinical characteristics and visual outcomes of patients with traffic accident-related open globe injuries, and to examine preoperative factors influencing the visual prognosis after pars plana vitrectomy, as compared with common open globe injuries.Methods:Patients with open globe injuries, who underwent pars plana vitrectomy, were identified. Patients' demographic and clinical data were entered into a computerized database for review and analysis; data included age, sex, initial visual acuity, duration between onset of injury and surgery, information about the type and cause of injury, wound location and length, presence of ocular complications, and final visual acuity.Results:Of the 355 open globe injuries, 14 were sustained during a traffic-related accident; the average age was 50.4 years (range: 20-85) and most (78.6%) were men. Of these 14 patients, 9 (64.3%) presented with rupture and 5 (35.7%) with laceration. Injuries were caused while driving (6 eyes; 42.9%), riding a bicycle (5 eyes; 35.7%), involved in car accident while walking (2 eyes; 14.3%), and riding a motorbike (1 eye; 7.1%). Initial visual acuity was significantly related to final visual acuity (P = 0.003, R2 = 0.80). The final visual acuity in patients with traffic accident-related open globe injuries was significantly better than that of the total group (P = 0.01).Conclusion:Traffic accident-related open globe injuries had better visual outcomes than common open globe injuries.

"Prevalence and characteristics of asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap in routine primary care practices",2019,"Rationale: Adults may exhibit characteristics of both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a situation recently described as asthma-COPD overlap (ACO). There is a paucity of information about ACO in primary care. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and describe characteristics of individuals withACOin primary care practices among patients currently diagnosed with asthma, COPD, or both; and to compare the prevalence and characteristics of ACO among the three source populations. Methods: The Respiratory Effectiveness Group conducted a crosssectional study of individuals ?40 years old and with ?2 outpatient primary care visits over a 2-year period in theUKOptimum Patient Care Research Database. Patients were classified into one of three source populations based on diagnostic codes: 1) COPD only, 2) both asthma and COPD, or 3) asthma only.ACOwas defined as the presence of all of the following 1) age ?40 years, 2) current or former smoking, 3) postbronchodilator airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in 1 second/ forced vital capacity <0.7), and 4) ?12% and ?200 ml reversibility in post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Results: Among 2,165 individuals (1,015 COPD only, 395 with both asthma and COPD, and 755 asthma only), the overall prevalence of ACO was 20% (95% confidence interval, 18-23%). Patients with ACO had a mean age of 70 years (standard deviation, 11 yr), 60% were men, 73% were former smokers (the rest were current smokers), and 66% were overweight or obese. Comorbid conditions were common in patients with ACO, including diabetes (53%), cardiovascular disease (36%), hypertension (30%), eczema (23%), and rhinitis (21%). The prevalence of ACO was higher in patients with a diagnosis of both asthma and COPD (32%) compared with a diagnosis of COPD only (20%; P<0.001) or asthma only (14%; P<0.001). Demographic and clinical characteristics of ACO varied across these three source populations. Conclusions: One in five individuals with a diagnosis of COPD, asthma, or both asthma and COPD in primary care settings have ACO based on the Respiratory Effectiveness Group ACO Working group criteria. The prevalence and characteristics of patients with ACO varies across the three source populations.

"Subclinical thiamine deficiency identified by preoperative evaluation in an ovarian cancer patient: Diagnosis and the need for preoperative thiamine measurement",2019,"Objective Although thiamine deficiency (TD) and Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) are not rare in cancer patients, the cases reported to date developed TD and/or WE after treatment had started.Method From a series of cancer patients, we report a patient diagnosed with TD without the typical clinical symptoms of WE at the preoperative psychiatric examination.Result A 43-year-old woman with ovarian cancer was referred by her oncologist to the psycho-oncology outpatient clinic for preoperative psychiatric evaluation. Her tumor had been growing rapidly before the referral. Although she did not develop delirium, cerebellar signs, or eye symptoms, we suspected she might have developed TD because of her 2-month loss of appetite as the storage capacity of thiamine in the body is approximately 18 days. The diagnosis of TD was supported by abnormally low serum thiamine levels.Significance of results Cancer therapists need to be aware that thiamine deficiency may occur even before the start of cancer treatment. In cases with a loss of appetite of more than 2 weeks' duration, in particular, thiamine deficiency should be considered if the tumor is rapidly increasing, regardless of the presence or absence of delirium.

"Intra-individual variations of organophosphate pesticide metabolite concentrations in repeatedly collected urine samples from pregnant women in Japan 11 Medical and Health Sciences 1117 Public Health and Health Services",2019,"Background: Low-dose exposure to organophosphate (OP) insecticides during pregnancy may adversely affect neurodevelopment in children. To evaluate the OP exposure levels, single urine sampling is commonly adopted to measure the levels of dialkylphosphates (DAPs), common OP metabolites. However, the inter-day variations of urinary DAP concentrations within subjects are supposed to be large due to the short biological half-lives of the metabolites, and it is thus considered difficult to accurately assess OP exposure during pregnancy with single sampling. This study aimed to assess intra-individual variations of DAP concentrations and the reproducibility of the exposure dose categorization of OPs according to DAP concentration ranges in pregnant women in Japan. Methods: Urine samples were collected from 62 non-smoking pregnant women (12-22 weeks of gestation) living in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. First morning void (FMV) and spot urine samples taken between lunch and dinner on the same day were collected on five different days during 2 weeks. The concentrations of DAP and creatinine in urine samples were measured using an ultra performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Creatinine-adjusted and unadjusted concentrations were used for the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) calculations and surrogate category analyses. Results: For all DAP metabolites, the creatinine-adjusted single ICCs exceeded 0.4, indicating moderate reliability. Overall, ICCs of spot urine samples taken in the afternoon were better than those taken as FMV. Surrogate category analyses showed that participants were categorized accurately into four exposure dose groups according to the quartile points. Conclusion: This study indicated that a single urine sample taken in the afternoon may be useful in assessing OP exposure as long as the exposure is categorized into quartiles when conducting epidemiological studies in early to mid-pregnant women in Japan. ? 2019 The Author(s).","creatinine; organophosphate pesticide; adult; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; creatinine urine level; female; human; Japan; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; metabolite; pregnant woman; reproducibility; urine sampling"
"Nationwide Increase in Complex Congenital Heart Diseases After the Fukushima Nuclear Accident",2019,"Background: After the Chernobyl nuclear accident in 1986, an increase in the incidence of congenital heart disease (CHDs) in the neighboring countries was reported. In 2011, Japan experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake and the nuclear accidents at Fukushima. However, a nationwide study of their effects has not been conducted yet. Methods and Results: We used data covering the period between 2007 and 2014 from the annual surveys conducted by the Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery, which included almost all of the operations pertaining to 46 types of CHDs in Japan. CHDs were divided into 2 groups based on complexity, the time of occurrence during heart development, and age at operation. We estimated the change in the number of the operations per 100?000 live births between pre- and postdisaster using a negative binomial generalized linear mixed model. Overall, a significant 14.2% (95% CI, 9.3–19.4) increase in the number of operations for complex CHDs in neonates and infants per 100?000 live births was found, whereas those performed for patients of 1 to 17?years old showed no significant change during the study period. Conclusions: The number of operations for complex CHDs in neonates and infants in Japan significantly increased after the massive disaster, and its level was maintained thereafter. The number of operations for complex CHD was not equal but closely correlated to the live birth prevalence of complex CHDs. Therefore, some meaningful increase in the live birth prevalence can be assumed; however, the precise cause of the increase is unknown. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Independent relationships of daily life activity and leisure-time exercise with metabolic syndrome and its traits in the general Japanese population",2019,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate independent relationships of daily non-exercise life activity and leisure-time exercise volume and intensity with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its traits in Japanese adults. Methods: Data of 24,625 eligible subjects (12,709 men, 11,916 women) who participated in the baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study were analyzed. Information about lifestyle characteristics was obtained from a questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses were performed to evaluate the independent associations of daily life activity as well as leisure-time exercise volume and intensity with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its traits by sex. Results: Male subjects with higher daily life activity as well as with higher leisure-time exercise volume had a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome, independently with each other. Female subjects with higher daily life activity also had a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Particularly, male and female subjects with the highest daily life activity quartile showed considerably low odds ratios of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53–0.81) and 0.64 (0.52–0.79), respectively, for low HDL-cholesterol even after the adjustment for BMI compared with the first quartile. Meanwhile, male subjects with the higher leisure-time exercise showed a quite lower prevalence of elevated triglycerides. Higher moderate-intensity exercise was more intensely associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome and some of its traits in both sexes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that higher daily life activity and higher moderate-intensity exercise may be independently associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome in Japanese adults. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; Article; blood pressure; body height; body mass; body weight; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; daily life activity; disease association; exercise; exercise intensity; female; gender; glucose blood level; human; Japanese (people); leisure; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; risk reduction; triacylglycerol blood level"
"Amyloid-β plaque formation and reactive gliosis are required for induction of cognitive deficits in App knock-in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease",2019,"Background: Knock-in (KI) mouse models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that endogenously overproduce Aβ without non-physiological overexpression of amyloid precursor protein (APP) provide important insights into the pathogenic mechanisms of AD. Previously, we reported that App NL-G-F mice, which harbor three familial AD mutations (Swedish, Beyreuther/Iberian, and Arctic) exhibited emotional alterations before the onset of definitive cognitive deficits. To determine whether these mice exhibit deficits in learning and memory at more advanced ages, we compared the Morris water maze performance of App NL-G-F and App NL mice, which harbor only the Swedish mutation, with that of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice at the age of 24 months. To correlate cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation, we also examined Aβ plaque formation and reactive gliosis in these mice. Results: In the Morris water maze, a spatial task, 24-month-old App NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice exhibited significantly poorer spatial learning than WT mice during the hidden training sessions, but similarly to WT mice during the visible training sessions. Not surprisingly, App NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice also exhibited spatial memory deficits both 1 and 7 days after the last training session. By contrast, 24-month-old App NL/NL mice had intact spatial learning and memory relative to WT mice. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that 24-month-old App NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice developed massive Aβ plaques and reactive gliosis (microgliosis and astrocytosis) throughout the brain, including the cortex and hippocampus. By contrast, we observed no detectable brain pathology in App NL/NL mice despite overproduction of human Aβ40 and Aβ42 in their brains. Conclusions: Aβ plaque formation, followed by sustained neuroinflammation, is necessary for the induction of definitive cognitive deficits in App-KI mouse models of AD. Our data also indicate that introduction of the Swedish mutation alone in endogenous APP is not sufficient to produce either AD-related brain pathology or cognitive deficits in mice. ? 2019 The Author(s).","amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); amyloid precursor protein; APP protein, human; peptide fragment; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; astrocytosis; cognitive defect; controlled study; female; gliosis; immunohistochemistry; male; mental task; Morris water maze test; mouse; mouse model; nervous system inflammation; neuropathology; nonhuman; spatial behavior; spatial learning; spatial memory; task performance; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; animal; brain; C57BL mouse; cognitive defect; disease model; gene knock-in; genetics; gliosis; human; inflammation; maze test; metabolism; pathology; physiology; psychology; transgenic mouse; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Animals; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Knock-In Techniques; Gliosis; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Maze Learning; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Peptide Fragments; Plaque, Amyloid; Spatial Memory"

"An Association Between Core Mutations in Hepatitis B Virus Genotype F1b and Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Alaskan Native People",2019,"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotype F1b infection is strongly associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in young Alaskan Native (AN) people. However, the mechanisms by which genotype F1b causes HCC are unclear. Here, we analyzed the clinical and virological significance of genotype F1b in long-term serial samples from 20 HCC patients with HBV infection. Complete sequence analyses revealed that all isolates were genotype F1b. In the HCC patients, T1938C and A2051C mutations in the core region had accumulated significantly with A1762T/G1764A mutations in the basal core promoter (BCP) region and G1896A mutation in the precore (PC) region. Several HBV clones containing the core mutations were examined for their replication efficiency and core stability in vitro. Clones containing the A2051C mutation replicated more efficiently than the wild type in association with enhanced stability of core protein dimerization. In chimeric mice with human hepatocytes carrying BCP/PC/2051 mutant but not with wild-type virus, liver fibrosis was induced in association with high levels of serum HBV DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen. Interestingly, microarray analysis and validation study showed that five genes associated with cell proliferation or carcinogenesis, v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog, Grb2-associated binding protein 2, bradykinin receptor B2, follistatin, and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8, were significantly up-regulated in human hepatocytes infected with genotype F1b, particularly the BCP/PC/2051 mutant, compared with other genotypes. Conclusion: We have identified an association between Alaska-specific core mutations and HCC development in AN people infected with genotype F1b; accumulation of these core mutations during the course of chronic infection with genotype F1b would contribute to HCC development in AN people earlier in life. ? 2018 by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases.","bradykinin B2 receptor; core protein; follistatin; GRB2 associated binding protein 2; hepatitis B surface antigen; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase kinase 8; protein serine threonine kinase; unclassified drug; adolescent; adult; Alaska Native; Article; cancer patient; cell proliferation; child; clinical article; dimerization; disease association; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype F1b; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; liver carcinogenesis; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; microarray analysis; molecular cloning; phylogeny; priority journal; promoter region; sequence analysis; virology; virus mutation; virus oncogene; virus replication"
"Long-term efficacy and safety of secukinumab in Japanese patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis: 3-year results of a double-blind extension study",2019,"Secukinumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody neutralizing interleukin-17A, has been shown to have significant efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. Long-term (3-year) efficacy and safety of secukinumab in Japanese patients with moderate to severe psoriasis were evaluated in an extension study of a large phase 3 global study (SCULPTURE). In the core study, 52 Japanese patients with 75% improvement of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) response at week 12 were re-randomized to a fixed interval (FI; every 4?weeks) schedule and retreatment as needed (RAN), in which patients received placebo until start of relapse, at which time secukinumab was reinitiated. Fifty Japanese patients completed the 52-week core study, and 47 patients entered the extension study with the same double-blind regimens up to week 152. All patients in the secukinumab 300?mg FI and seven patients in 150?mg FI groups completed 3?years of treatment. PASI-90 and -100 at the end of year 3 were achieved in 69.2% and 53.8%, respectively, in 300?mg FI and 42.9% and 42.9%, respectively, in 150?mg FI, indicating high sustained response in 300?mg FI. Mean absolute PASI was continually low in 300?mg FI and numerically higher in 150?mg FI. Dermatology Life Quality Index of 0/1 was maintained by approximately two-thirds of 300?mg FI patients, and all EuroQoL 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire domain measures were also improved. FI dosing was consistently more efficacious than RAN. The safety profile of secukinumab remained favorable, with no new safety concerns identified. ? 2019 The Authors.

"aCGH Analysis of Predictive Biomarkers for Response to Bevacizumab plus Oxaliplatin- or Irinotecan-Based Chemotherapy in Patients with Metastatic Colorectal Cancer",2019,"Background: The randomized phase III study (WJOG4407G) showed equivalent efficacy between FOLFOX and FOLFIRI in combination with bevacizumab as the first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We studied whole genome copy number profiles using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis of tumor tissue samples obtained in this study. The aim of this study was to identify gene copy number alterations that could aid in selecting either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in combination with bevacizumab for patients with mCRC. Materials and Methods: DNA was purified from 154 pretreatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples (75 from the FOLFOX arm and 79 from the FOLFIRI arm) of 395 patients enrolled in the WJOG4407G trial and analyzed by aCGH. Genomic regions greater than 1.2-fold were regarded as copy number gain (CNG). Results: Patient characteristics between the treatment arms were well balanced except for tumor laterality (left side; 64% in FOLFOX arm and 80% in FOLFIRI arm, p =.07). FOLFIRI showed a trend toward better response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than FOLFOX in the patients with CNG of chromosome 8q24.1 (Fisher's exact test, p =.134 for RR; interaction test, p =.102 for PFS and p =.003 for OS) and 8q24.2 (Fisher's exact test, p =.179 for RR; interaction test, p =.144 for PFS and p =.002 for OS). Conclusion: Chromosome 8q24.1–q24.2 may contain genes that could potentially serve as predictive markers for selecting either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in combination with bevacizumab for treatment of patients with mCRC. Implications for Practice: Bevacizumab has been used as a standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in combination with either oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Until now, there has been no predictive marker to choose between the two combination chemotherapies. This array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed that the difference in therapeutic effect between the two combination chemotherapies is prominent in patients with mCRC with gene copy number gain in chromosome 8p24.1–p24.2. Such patients showed more favorable response and survival when treated with irinotecan-based combination chemotherapy. Overlapping genes commonly found in this region may be predictive biomarkers of the efficacy of the combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab. ?

"Impact of treatment planning using a structure block function on the target and organ doses related to patient movement in cervical esophageal cancer: A phantom study",2019,"Helical tomotherapy (HT) can restrict beamlets passing through the virtual contour on computed tomography (CT) image in dose optimization, reducing the dose to organs at risk (OARs). Beamlet restriction limits the incident beamlet angles; thus, the proper planning target volume (PTV) margin may differ from that of the standard treatment plan without beamlet restriction, depending on the patient's movement during dose delivery. Dose distribution changes resulting from patient movement have not been described for treatment plans with beamlet restriction. This study quantified changes in dose distribution to the target and OARs when beamlet restriction is applied to cervical esophageal cancer treatment plan using HT by systematically shifting a phantom. Treatment plans for cervical esophageal cancers with and without beamlet restriction modes [directional block (DB) and nonblock (NB), respectively] were designed for CT images of the RANDO phantom. The PTV margin for the DB mode was set to be the same as that for the NB mode (5?mm). The CT image was intentionally shifted by ±1, ±2, and ±3 voxels in the left–right, anterior–posterior, and superior–inferior directions, and the dose distribution was recalculated for each position using the fluence for the NB or DB mode. When the phantom shift was within the same PTV margin as the NB mode, changes in doses to the targets, lungs, heart, and spinal cord in the DB mode were small as those in the NB mode. In conclusion, the virtual contour shape used in this study would provide safe delivery even with patient movement within the same PTV margin as for the NB mode. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Surgery for Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumor G3 and Carcinoma G3 Should be Considered Separately",2019,"Background: The role of surgery in pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm grade?3 (pNEN-G3) treatment remains unclear. We aimed to clarify the role of surgery for pNEN-G3, which has recently been reclassified as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor-G3 (pNET-G3) and pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma-G3 (pNEC-G3), with and without metastases, respectively. Methods: We analyzed a subgroup of patients from the Japanese pancreatic NEC study, a Japanese multicenter case-series study of pNEN-G3. Pathologists subclassified 67 patients as having pNET-G3 or pNEC-G3 based on morphological features. We compared the overall survival (OS) rates among patients who were grouped according to whether they had undergone tumor-targeted surgery for tumors without (SwoM) or with (SwM) metastases, or non-surgical procedures (NS). Results: Data from 21 patients with pNET-G3 (SwoM, n = 6; SwM, n = 5; NS, n = 10) and 46 patients with pNEC-G3 (SwoM, n = 8; SwM, n = 5; NS, n = 33) were analyzed. OS of patients with pNET-G3 was significantly longer after SwoM and SwM than with NS (p = 0.018 and p = 0.022). In contrast, OS did not significantly differ between either SwoM or SwM and NS (p = 0.093 and p = 0.489) among patients with pNEC-G3. Conclusion: The role of surgery should be considered separately for pNET-G3 and pNEC-G3. Although SwoM and SwM can be considered for pNET-G3, caution is advised before considering SwM and SwoM for pNEC-G3. ? 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.","adult; aged; cancer staging; carcinoma; female; follow up; human; male; metastasis; middle aged; mortality; neuroendocrine tumor; pancreas tumor; pancreatectomy; pathology; survival rate; tumor invasion; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Staging; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Pancreatectomy; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Survival Rate"
"Cullin-3/KCTD10 complex is essential for K27-polyubiquitination of EIF3D in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells",2019,"Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D (EIF3D) binds to the 5′-cap of specific mRNAs, initiating their translation into polypeptides. From a pathological standpoint, EIF3D has been observed to be essential for cell growth in various cancer types, and cancer patients with high EIF3D mRNA levels exhibit poor prognosis, indicating involvement of EIF3D in oncogenesis. In this study, we found, by mass spectrometry, that Cullin-3 (CUL3)/KCTD10 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase forms a complex with EIF3D. We also demonstrated that EIF3D is K27-polyubiquitinated at the lysine 153 and 275 residues in a KCTD10-dependent manner in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Similar to other cancers, high expression of EIF3D significantly correlated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and depletion of EIF3D drastically suppressed HepG2 cell proliferation. These results indicate that EIF3D is a novel substrate of CUL3/KCTD10 Ub ligase and suggest involvement of K27-polyubiquitinated EIF3D in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. ? 2019 The Authors","cullin; cullin 3; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D; initiation factor 3; KCTD10 ubiquitin ligase; lysine; ubiquitin protein ligase; unclassified drug; Article; cancer prognosis; cell proliferation; complex formation; controlled study; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; mass spectrometry; mRNA expression level; priority journal; transcriptomics; ubiquitination"
"Proton pump inhibitor ameliorates taste disturbance among patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux: A randomized controlled study",2019,"Patients with laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR) were reported to suffer from hypogeusia that affects quality of life. Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is a useful drug in the treatment of LPR, but its effect on hypogeusia is not known. We therefore assessed the effects of PPI or a histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) on hypogeusia among patients with LPR. Both PPI and H2 blocker could inhibit acid reflux. LPR was diagnosed with reflux finding score and reflux symptom index. The visual analogue scale (VAS) of taste disturbance symptoms and the gustatory tests were assessed before and 8 weeks after treatment with esomeprazole, a PPI (20 patients, aged 50.0 ± 1.7 years) or famotidine, a H2 blocker (20 patients, aged 47.1 ± 1.8 years). There were no significant differences in VAS scores and recognition thresholds for four basic tastes between the two groups before treatment. Only PPI therapy significantly decreased the VAS scores, suggesting the improvement of taste perception. Moreover, PPI therapy significantly decreased recognition thresholds for bitter taste in the anterior tongue (chorda tympani nerve area) and the thresholds in the posterior tongue (glossopharyngeal nerve area) for salty, sour, and bitter tastes. By contrast, H2-blocker therapy caused no significant changes of thresholds in the anterior tongue, but improved the threshold only for bitter in the posterior tongue, the value of which was however significantly higher than that in PPI group. In conclusion, PPI could ameliorate hypogeusia by improving bitter, salty, and sour tastes among patients with LPR. ? 2018 Tohoku University Medical Press.","esomeprazole; famotidine; proton pump inhibitor; adult; Article; bitter taste; causal attribution; chorda tympani; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; glossopharyngeal nerve; human; hypogeusia; Japanese (people); laryngopharyngeal reflux; male; randomized controlled trial; saltiness; sex difference; taste acuity; taste discrimination; treatment duration; treatment outcome; visual analog scale; aged; drug effect; laryngopharyngeal reflux; middle aged; pain measurement; pathophysiology; perceptive threshold; taste; Adult; Aged; Chorda Tympani Nerve; Female; Glossopharyngeal Nerve; Humans; Laryngopharyngeal Reflux; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Sensory Thresholds; Taste"
"A complementary scheme for automated detection of high-uptake regions on dedicated breast PET and whole-body PET/CT",2019,"In this study, we aimed to develop a hybrid method for automated detection of high-uptake regions in the breast and axilla using dedicated breast positron-emission tomography (db PET) and whole-body PET/computed tomography (CT) images. In our proposed method, high-uptake regions in the breast and axilla were detected using db PET images and whole-body PET/CT images. In db PET images, high-uptake regions in the breast were detected using adaptive thresholding technique based on the noise characteristics. In whole-body PET/CT images, the region of the breast that includes the axilla was first extracted using CT images. Next, high-uptake regions in the extracted breast region were detected on the PET images. By integration of the results of the two types of PET images, a final candidate region was obtained. In the experiments, the accuracy of extracting the region of the breast and detection ability was evaluated using clinical data. As a result, all breast regions were extracted correctly. The sensitivity of detection was 0.765, and the number of false positive cases were 1.8, which was 30% better than those on whole-body PET/CT alone. These results suggested that the proposed method, combining the two types of PET images is effective for improving detection performance. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.","fluorodeoxyglucose; accuracy; analytic method; Article; automation; axilla; breast; clinical article; controlled study; dedicated breast positron emission tomography; diagnostic value; experimental study; false positive result; high uptake region; human; image processing; intermethod comparison; priority journal; radiological parameters; radiological procedures; sensitivity analysis; whole body CT; whole body PET; automation; breast; diagnostic imaging; metabolism; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; procedures; transport at the cellular level; whole body imaging; Automation; Biological Transport; Breast; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Whole Body Imaging"
"Trends and efficacy of interferon-free anti–hepatitis C virus therapy in the region of high prevalence of elderly patients, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma: A real-world, nationwide, multicenter study of 10 688 patients in Japan",2019,"Background. We investigated changes in patient characteristics, rate of sustained virologic response (SVR), and factors associated with SVR after anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens in real-world practice in Japan, where patients with HCV are characterized by older age and high prevalence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods. Changes in patient characteristics and SVR rates were evaluated from medical records among 10 688 patients who started interferon (IFN)-free DAA therapy between September 2014 and June 2018 in a nationwide, multicenter study. Factors associated with failure of SVR were analyzed. In particular, effects of cirrhosis or history of HCC on SVR were assessed by exact matching. Results. Patient age was becoming younger and baseline liver fibrosis was becoming milder over time. Overall SVR rate was 95.4%. The SVR rates increased over time in patients without a history of IFN-free DAA therapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that cirrhosis was unfavorably associated with achievement of SVR in both patients with genotype 1 (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27–2.21) and genotype 2 (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.01–2.78). Comparisons after exact matching showed that the SVR rate was significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis than without it, whereas patients with and without a history of HCC had similar SVR rates. Conclusions. Background characteristics of patients who undergo IFN-free DAA therapy are changing in Japan. Patients without a history of IFN-free DAA therapy have high SVR rates. Exact matching confirmed that cirrhosis significantly influences the achievement of SVR in real-world settings. ? The Author(s) 2019.

"Urinary Cysteine-Rich Protein 61 and Trefoil Factor 3 as Diagnostic Biomarkers for Colorectal Cancer",2019,"Since a fecal occult blood test for colorectal cancer (CRC) does not offer sufficient diagnostic power for CRC, novel non-invasive biomarkers are hopeful for CRC screening. We conducted the current study to discover non-invasive urinary biomarkers for diagnosing CRC. Among urine samples from 258 patients (CRC, n = 148; healthy controls, n = 110), a cohort of 176 patients composed of 88 patients with GC and 88 healthy controls was selected after age- and sex-matching using propensity score. This cohort was then randomly divided into 2 groups: 53 pairs (106 patients) in the training cohort, and 35 pairs (70 patients) in the validation cohort. No significant differences were found for baseline characteristics between the CRC and healthy control groups in both training and validation cohorts. On multivariate analysis in the training cohort, urinary levels of cysteine-rich protein 61 (uCyr61) and trefoil factor 3 (uTFF3) were identified as independent significant diagnostic markers for CRC. Moreover, uCyr61 alone and the combination of uCyr61 and uTFF3 allowed significant differentiation between healthy controls and CRC groups in the training set (uCyr61: area under the curve (AUC) = 0.745 [95% CI, 0.653–0.838]; uCyr61 + uTFF3: AUC = 0.753 [95% CI, 0.659–0.847]). In the validation cohort, uCyr61 and uTFF3 were significantly higher in the CRC group than in the healthy control group, and they also allowed significant differentiation between healthy control and CRC groups (uCyr61: AUC = 0.696 [95% CI, 0.571–0.822]; uTFF3: AUC = 0.639 [95% CI, 0.508–0.770]; uCyr61 + uTFF3: AUC = 0.720 [95% CI, 0.599–0.841]), as in the training cohort. A panel combining uCyr61 and uTFF3 offers a promising non-invasive biomarker for diagnosing CRC. ? 2018 The Authors","cysteine rich protein 61; trefoil factor 3; tumor marker; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cancer staging; colorectal cancer; controlled study; creatinine urine level; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; predictive value; propensity score; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; urinalysis; very elderly"
"Association between maternal blood cadmium and lead concentrations and gestational diabetes mellitus in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study",2019,"Purpose: To examine the association between elevated blood cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) concentrations and increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: This cross-sectional study included pregnant women (n = 16,955) enrolled in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in blood samples collected at 22–28?weeks’ gestation were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. GDM was diagnosed according to the 2011 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results: Blood Cd and Pb concentrations were slightly higher among women with GDM than among those without GDM; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Elevated blood Cd and Pb concentrations were not associated with increased GDM risk in the nulliparous group (Cd OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.28–2.08 for high vs low category; Pb OR 2.51; 95% CI 0.72–8.72) or the parous group (Cd OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.29–1.44; Pb OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.04–2.29). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Cd and Pb exposure, in the range of blood levels observed, has no significant relationship with the development of GDM. Further prospective studies would be valuable to confirm these findings. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cadmium; lead; adult; blood; cross-sectional study; female; human; Japan; parity; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; Adult; Cadmium; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Humans; Japan; Lead; Parity; Pregnancy"
"Depressive symptoms during the first month of chemotherapy and survival in patients with hematological malignancies: A prospective cohort study",2019,"Objective: The objective of the study is to investigate depressive symptoms before and after the initiation of chemotherapy and their impact on overall survival (OS) among patients with hematological malignancies. Methods: We performed a prospective analysis of consecutive patients with newly diagnosed malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma enrolled between September 2010 and March 2016. We evaluated depression symptoms at two time points: before starting chemotherapy (T1) and 1?month later (T2), using PHQ-9 and known prognostic factors. We allocated participants with depressive symptoms at T1 and/or T2 to a depression group that was subdivided as follows: new depressive symptoms at T2, (“new-onset”), remission of depressive symptoms at T2 (“remission”), and persistent depressive symptoms from T1 to T2 (“persistent”). The main outcome, OS, was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results: Of the 294 eligible participants, we analyzed 255 patients, including 83 with depression. There were 19 participants in the new-onset, 38 in the remission, and 26 in the persistent depression group. The OS of participants with depression was significantly shorter than that of those without depression (adjusted hazard ratio [AjHR] 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-4.12; P?<.001). Using the never-depressive symptoms group as a reference group, AjHRs were as follows: new-onset, 1.91 (95% CI, 0.77-4.75; 0.166); remission, 2.98 (95% CI, 1.55-5.74; 0.001), and persistent, 2.17 (95%CI, 1.01-4.68; 0.047). Conclusions: Among patients with mature lymphoid malignancy, the group with depression at baseline had a poorer survival, both in the group that remained depressive and the group that recovered from depressive symptoms. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer regression; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; depression; female; hematologic malignancy; hospital patient; human; longitudinal study; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiple myeloma; observational study; overall survival; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; prospective study; remission; survival rate; survival time; symptom"
"Culture-based bacterial evaluation of the appendix lumen in patients with and without acute appendicitis",2019,"Purpose: Controversy exists over whether bacterial flora within the appendix differs between patients with and without appendicitis. To examine these potential differences, we cultured the appendiceal luminal microbiota of patients with and without acute appendicitis, and identified the bacterial species therein. Methods: Fifty-seven patients with acute appendicitis and 37 patients without acute appendicitis who underwent curative resection of colorectal cancer and prophylactic appendectomies (control group) were included. Appendicitis patients were classified into the phlegmonous group or the gangrenous appendicitis group histopathologically. There was no patient with perforated appendicitis. Aerobic isolates were identified using standard identification schemata, and anaerobic isolates were identified according to the Japanese guidelines. Results: There were no significant differences among the three groups in the median number aerobe species present per patient. However, the median number anaerobe species in the gangrenous appendicitis group was significantly higher than that of the control group and the phlegmonous appendicitis group. In addition, the incidence of patients with Bacillus species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bilophila wadsworthia increased as the disease progressed from phlegmonous to gangrenous appendicitis. Conclusion: The present results suggest that increased diversity of anaerobes and the translocation of Bacillus species, F. nucleatum, and B. wadsworthia are associated with the progression of acute appendicitis. ? 2019 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases","antibiotic agent; acute appendicitis; adult; aerobic bacterium; aged; anaerobic bacterium; antibiotic therapy; appendectomy; appendix; Article; Bacillus; bacterium culture; Bacteroides fragilis; Bacteroides vulgatus; Bilophila wadsworthia; Citrobacter; Clostridium; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; disease exacerbation; Enterobacter; Enterococcus avium; Enterococcus faecalis; Enterococcus faecium; Escherichia coli; female; Fusobacterium mortiferum; Fusobacterium necrophorum; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Fusobacterium varium; gangrene; histopathology; human; Klebsiella oxytoca; Klebsiella pneumoniae; major clinical study; male; microflora; non-fermenting Gram-negative bacterium; nonhuman; Peptococcus; Peptostreptococcus; phlegmon; Porphyromonas; preoperative period; Prevotella; prophylactic surgical procedure; Proteus; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Streptococcus; Veillonella; acute disease; appendicitis; appendix; bacterial infection; Bilophila; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; middle aged; pathology; Acute Disease; Adult; Appendectomy; Appendicitis; Appendix; Bacillus; Bacteria, Aerobic; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Bacterial Infections; Bilophila; Female; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Humans; Male; Microbiota; Middle Aged"
"Influence of renal dysfunction on dose reduction and virologic efficacy of regimens combining ribavirin and all-oral direct acting antivirals in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection",2019,"Aim: Several interferon (IFN)-free, all-oral regimens with direct acting antivirals (DAAs) for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection also include ribavirin (RBV). We investigated the influence of renal dysfunction on virologic efficacy and adverse effects in 189 patients with HCV genotype 2 infection who received combination RBV–DAA regimens. Methods: The incidence of RBV-induced anemia, RBV dose reduction, and virologic efficacy were compared according to baseline renal function as defined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Results: Patients with renal dysfunction (eGFR = 30–59?mL/min/1.73?m2) had higher rate of RBV dose reduction and more marked decreases in hemoglobin levels. These findings were more pronounced in patients with the ITPA CC genotype, who are more sensitive to RBV-induced anemia. Although there were no statistically significant differences in sustained virologic response (SVR) rates according to renal function overall (P = 0.1650), the SVR rate was significantly lower in patients who required RBV dose reduction than in those who did not (P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Baseline renal dysfunction could unfavorably affect the outcomes of RBV–DAA in patients with chronic HCV infection due to the increased risk of RBV dose reduction, even in the era of IFN-free DAA regimens. ? 2019 The Japan Society of Hepatology","alanine aminotransferase; albumin; antivirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; creatinine; direct acting antiviral agent; hemoglobin; ombitasvir; paritaprevir; ribavirin; ritonavir; sofosbuvir; unclassified drug; virus RNA; aged; anemia; antibody titer; Article; calculation; chronic hepatitis C; creatinine clearance; disease severity assessment; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; follow up; gene frequency; gene mutation; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; human; hypertension; incidence; kidney dysfunction; kidney function; limit of detection; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; platelet count; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; sustained virologic response; virus load"
"Thiamine deficiency observed in a cancer patient's caregiver",2019,"Objective Thiamine deficiency (TD) is recognized in various kinds of disease with associated loss of appetite including cancer; however, TD has not been recognized in the family caregivers of cancer patients to date.Method From a series of cancer patient caregivers, we reported an aged family caregiver who developed TD while caring for the cancer patient.Result The caregiver was a 90-year-old male. He had been accompanying his wife, who was diagnosed with colon cancer 4 years previously, on hospital visits as the primary caregiver, but because of psychological issues, he was recommended to visit the psycho-oncology department's caregiver's clinic for a consultation. Detailed examination revealed that his appetite had been only about 50% of usual from about one year before, and he had lost 12 kg in weight in one year. The diagnosis of TD was supported by his abnormally low serum thiamine level.Significance of the results This report demonstrates that there is a possibility that care providers could develop TD from the burdens associated with caregiving. TD should be considered whenever there is a loss of appetite lasting for more than 2 weeks, and medical staff should pay careful attention to the physical condition of care providers to prevent complications resulting from TD.

"Antitumor effect of a novel photodynamic therapy with acetylated glucose-conjugated chlorin for gastrointestinal cancers",2019,"Background/Aim: We previously synthesized a glucose-conjugated chlorin compound e6 (G-chlorin e6), and reported that it has very strong antitumor effects. The aim of the present study was to synthesize acetylated glucose-conjugated chlorin (AcN003HP) and evaluate its antitumor effect and excretion. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the antitumor effect of AcN003HP, its IC50 was calculated as well as its accumulation in cancer cells was examined by flow cytometry. Confocal microscopy was used to observe the intracellular localization of AcN003HP. The excretion and antitumor effects of AcN003HP were also evaluated in vivo. Results: AcN003HP showed stronger antitumor effects and accumulation into cancer cells compared to talaporfin sodium, a conventional photosensitizer. AcN003HP was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. In a xenograft tumor mouse model, AcN003HP showed longer excretion time from the body than G-chlorin e6, and photodynamic therapy using AcN003HP showed very strong antitumor effects. Conclusion: The safety, improved controllability, and robust antitumor effects suggest AcN003HP as a good next-generation photosensitizer. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

"Exploring the validation of a Japanese version of the International Hip Outcome Tool 12: Reliability, validity, and responsiveness",2019,"Backgrounds: The International Hip Outcome Tool 12 (iHOT12) was authorized by the Multicenter Arthroscopy of the Hip Outcomes Research Network (MAHORN). iHOT12 is increasingly being adopted in orthopedic studies to report patient outcomes. This study aimed to develop a Japanese version of the International Hip Outcome Tools “iHOT12J”, and to establish its reliability, validity, and responsiveness. Methods: To assess test-retest reliability, an identical set of patients reported outcome measures with five qualitative scoring measures including iHOT12; these were filled out by each patient twice. Reliability was explored using Cronbachss alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient. The Bland–Altman plot was used to explore the absolute agreement. To evaluate validity, we examined the relationships between SF36 and iHOT12. Responsiveness was assessed by comparing the smallest detectable change to the minimal important change by applying an anchor-based approach. Results: Fifty patients (51 joints) were analyzed from March 2016 to October 2017 in Japanese four facility. The Cronbach α coefficient was 0.90 and the average value of intraclass coefficient (ICC) was 0.89. Bland–Altman plot analysis showed a solid agreement. Regarding the validity, the Spearman rank correlation coefficients were strong with PF (r = 0.69, p < 0.01), BP (r = 0.71, p < 0.01) and PCS (r = 0.69, p < 0.01). The smallest detectable change (3.19) was smaller than the minimum important change (12.40). Conclusions: We developed iHOT12J, which seems to show sufficient reliability, validity, and responsiveness. We believe that this patient reported outcome measure is beneficial in studying Japanese patients with femoroacetabular impingement. ? 2018 The Authors","adult; arthroscopic surgery; Article; conservative treatment; female; femoroacetabular impingement; hip dysplasia; human; International Hip Outcome Tool 12; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal disease assessment; pilot study; questionnaire; Short Form 36; test retest reliability; validity; adolescent; arthroscopy; convalescence; femoroacetabular impingement; Japan; joint characteristics and functions; middle aged; observer variation; pathophysiology; patient-reported outcome; publication; quality of life; reproducibility; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Arthroscopy; Female; Femoracetabular Impingement; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Quality of Life; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translations; Young Adult"
"Associations in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes between clinicopathological factors and clinical outcomes in estrogen receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 negative breast cancer",2019,"The value of assessing tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in estrogen receptor (ER) positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2) negative breast cancer has yet to be determined. In the present study, a total of 184 cases with early distant recurrence detected within 5 years following the primary operation, 134 with late distant recurrence diagnosed following 5 years or longer and 321 controls without recurrence for >10 years following starting the initial treatment for ER-positive/HER2 negative breast cancer, registered in 9 institutions, were analyzed. The distributions of TILs and their clinical relevance were investigated. TIL distributions did not differ significantly among the early, late and no recurrence groups, employing a 30% cut-off point as a dichotomous variable. In those who had received adjuvant chemotherapy as well as endocrine therapy, a trend toward higher TIL proportions was detected when the early recurrence group was compared with the no recurrence group employing the 30% cut-off point (P=0.064). The TIL distributions were significantly associated with nodal metastasis (P=0.004), ER status (P=0.045), progesterone receptor (PgR) status (P=0.002), tumor grade (P=0.021), and the Ki67 labeling index (LI) (P=0.002) in the no recurrence group and with the Ki67 LI in the recurrence groups (P=0.002 in early recurrence group, P=0.023 in late recurrence group). High TIL distributions also predicted shorter survival time following the detection of recurrence (P=0.026). However, these prognostic interactions were not significant in multivariate analysis (P=0.200). The present retrospective study demonstrated no significant interaction between TIL proportions and the timing of recurrence. However, higher TIL proportions were observed in breast cancer patients with aggressive biological phenotypes, which tended to be more responsive to chemotherapy. The clinical relevance of stromal TILs for identifying patients who would likely benefit from additional therapies merits further investigation in a larger patient population. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

"Long noncoding RNA ELIT-1 acts as a Smad3 cofactor to facilitate TGFb/Smad signaling and promote epithelial–mesenchymal transition",2019,"TGFb is involved in various biological processes, including development, differentiation, growth regulation, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). In TGFb/Smad signaling, receptor-activated Smad complexes activate or repress their target gene promoters. Smad cofactors are a group of Smad-binding proteins that promote recruitment of Smad complexes to these promoters. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNA), which behave as Smad cofactors, have thus far not been identified. Here, we characterize a novel lncRNA EMT-associated lncRNA induced by TGFb1 (ELIT-1). ELIT-1 was induced by TGFb stimulation via the TGFb/Smad pathway in TGFb-responsive cell lines. ELIT-1 depletion abrogated TGFb-mediated EMT progression and expression of TGFb target genes including Snail, a transcription factor critical for EMT. A positive correlation between high expression of ELIT-1 and poor prognosis in patients with lung adenocarcinoma and gastric cancer suggests that ELIT-1 may be useful as a prognostic and therapeutic target. RIP assays revealed that ELIT-1 bound to Smad3, but not Smad2. In conjunction with Smad3, ELIT-1 enhanced Smad-responsive promoter activities by recruiting Smad3 to the promoters of its target genes including Snail, other TGFb target genes, and ELIT-1 itself. Collectively, these data show that ELIT-1 is a novel trans-acting lncRNA that forms a positive feedback loop to enhance TGFb/Smad3 signaling and promote EMT progression. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.","long untranslated RNA; RNA ELIT 1; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; transcription factor Snail; transforming growth factor beta; unclassified drug; Article; cancer growth; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene expression; gene function; gene induction; gene targeting; human; human cell; luciferase assay; lung adenocarcinoma; microarray analysis; positive feedback; priority journal; promoter region; protein depletion; protein expression; protein RNA binding; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA analysis; signal transduction; stomach cancer"
"A successful case of percutaneous fistula closure in a patient with high output heart failure and extracardiac arteriovenous fistula",2019,"Intra-cardiac shunt diseases may cause chronic ventricular volume overload, but extra-cardiac fistula could also cause high-output heart failure (HF). A patient presented with high-output HF and significant extra-cardiac shunt flow. Although the size and shape of the patient's left ventricle suggested dilated cardiomyopathy, considerable origins were not identified except for a high-flow fistula between the right subclavian artery and right internal jugular vein. Right heart catheter examination revealed inappropriately high cardiac output. Left-to-right shunt ratio was calculated at 40.3% from an oximetry run, under the assumption that the left anonymous vein which was not contaminated with any shunt flow could be substituted for venous return from the upper body. We could determine the indication of fistula closure according to the estimated high left-to-right shunt ratio, reducing cardiac output by 42.7% which was similar to the pre-estimated left-to-right shunt ratio. Two months later, the patient's serum B-type natriuretic peptide level and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters were decreased. The proposed method to estimate the left-to-right shunt ratio was useful in determining the indication for fistula closure in a patient with HF and a significant shunt fistula. <Learning objective: A significant extracardiac left-to-right shunt more than 30–35% could cause heart failure with left ventricular dilatation similar to dilated cardiomyopathy. One can decide fistula closure with the finding of left-to-right shunt ratio calculated using a transcatheter oximetry run. It is mandatory that the venous oxygen saturation at the upper stream of fistula is determined precisely without the contamination of arterial blood. In this case, the oxygen saturation at the left anonymous vein substituted for it.> ? 2018 Japanese College of Cardiology","azosemide; brain natriuretic peptide; aged; arteriovenous fistula; Article; case report; clinical article; congestive cardiomyopathy; dyspnea; female; heart catheterization; heart left right shunt; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; heart output; high output heart failure; human; internal jugular vein; interventional cardiovascular procedure; oxygen saturation; percutaneous fistula closure; priority journal; protein blood level; pulmonary artery; right subclavian artery; systolic heart murmur; transthoracic echocardiography; venous return"
"Impact of Baseline Retinal Nonperfusion and Macular Retinal Capillary Nonperfusion on Outcomes in the COPERNICUS and GALILEO Studies",2019,"Purpose: To evaluate the impact of baseline retinal capillary nonperfusion (RNP) and macular retinal capillary nonperfusion (MNP) status on outcomes at week 24 (W24). Design: Post hoc analyses of 2 phase 3, randomized, double-masked, multicenter, sham-controlled studies. Participants: Three hundred sixty-six patients with macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion randomized in COPERNICUS and GALILEO. Methods: We randomized patients 3:2 to receive intravitreal aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks or sham injections until W24. RNP and MNP were assessed by a masked independent reading center. Main Outcome Measures: Proportion of patients with 10 disc areas (DA) or more of RNP and any degree of MNP at W24, relative risks of 10 DA or more of RNP or any degree of MNP at W24 developing, change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) by baseline RNP and MNP status, and relationship between baseline RNP and MNP status. Results: At baseline, 24.6% of patients showed 10 DA or more of RNP and 72.6% showed MNP, regardless of baseline RNP status. At W24, the pooled proportions of patients in the intravitreal aflibercept and sham groups with 10 DA or more of RNP were 11.6% and 29.0%, respectively (P = 0.0001); the respective proportions with any degree of MNP were 61.2% and 79.5% (P = 0.0008). Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for intravitreal aflibercept versus sham were 0.4 (0.25–0.62) for 10 DA or more of RNP and 0.8 (0.68–0.90) for MNP, indicating a lower risk for these outcomes with intravitreal aflibercept than with sham. Mean BCVA change was greater in intravitreal aflibercept- versus sham-treated eyes, with less than 10 DA and 10 DA or more of RNP at baseline (+17.5 vs. +0.8 letters and +18.3 vs. ?4.1 letters, respectively) and with and without baseline MNP (+15.7 vs. +0.3 letters and +17.1 vs. +0.4 letters, respectively). Agreement between baseline RNP and MNP status was low (κ = 0.12). The proportions of patients with 1 or more ocular serious adverse event in the intravitreal aflibercept- and sham-treated groups, respectively, were 3.2% and 11.3%. Conclusions: At W24, visual and anatomic improvements, including perfusion status, were greater in eyes treated with intravitreal aflibercept than in eyes treated with sham, regardless of baseline RNP or MNP status. ? 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology","aflibercept; retinal; adult; Article; best corrected visual acuity; central retina vein occlusion; central retinal thickness; controlled study; corneal abrasion; drug efficacy; drug safety; electroretinography; endophthalmitis; eye disease; human; intrarater reliability; iris neovascularization; macular edema; macular ischemia; macular retinal capillary nonperfusion; major clinical study; multicenter study; observational study; ophthalmoscopy; optical coherence tomography; optical coherence tomography angiography; outcome assessment; perfusion; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; reperfusion injury; retina artery occlusion; retina hemorrhage; retinal capillary nonperfusion; risk factor; therapy effect; visual acuity; visual field; visual system parameters; vitreous body detachment"
"Recent advances in endoscopic biliary drainage for unresectable malignant hilar biliary obstruction",2019,"Malignant hilar biliary obstruction is caused by various diseases. The location and degree of biliary obstruction are different in each case. Endoscopic biliary drainage using stents is the first-line therapy for unresectable biliary obstruction. Uncovered self-expandable metallic stent (SEMS) is widely used because of longer stent patency. Plastic stent and covered SEMS with 6mm diameter have also been recently used. However, there has been no evidence with regard to drainage area (unilateral or bilateral) or deployment for bilateral drainage (side-by-side or stent-in-stent). Plastic stent is commonly used in re-intervention for recurrent biliary obstruction, but SEMS might be another option on the basis of longer stent patency. ? 2019 Japan Gastroenterological Endoscopy Society.

"Epidermal growth factor receptor is a host-entry cofactor triggering hepatitis B virus internalization",2019,"Sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP) is a host cell receptor required for hepatitis B virus (HBV) entry. However, the susceptibility of NTCP-expressing cells to HBV is diverse depending on the culture condition. Stimulation with epidermal growth factor (EGF) was found to potentiate cell susceptibility to HBV infection. Here, we show that EGF receptor (EGFR) plays a critical role in HBV virion internalization. In EGFR-knockdown cells, HBV or its preS1-specific fluorescence peptide attached to the cell surface, but its internalization was attenuated. PreS1 internalization and HBV infection could be rescued by complementation with functional EGFR. Interestingly, the HBV/preS1–NTCP complex at the cell surface was internalized concomitant with the endocytotic relocalization of EGFR. Molecular interaction between NTCP and EGFR was documented by immunoprecipitation assay. Upon dissociation from functional EGFR, NTCP no longer functioned to support viral infection, as demonstrated by either (i) the introduction of NTCP point mutation that disrupted its interaction with EGFR, (ii) the detrimental effect of decoy peptide interrupting the NTCP–EGFR interaction, or (iii) the pharmacological inactivation of EGFR. Together, these data support the crucial role of EGFR in mediating HBV–NTCP internalization into susceptible cells. EGFR thus provides a yet unidentified missing link from the cell-surface HBV–NTCP attachment to the viral invasion beyond the host cell membrane. ? 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

"Biallelic KARS pathogenic variants cause an early-onset progressive leukodystrophy",2019,"The leukodystrophies cause severe neurodevelopmental defects from birth and follow an incurable and progressive course that often leads to premature death. It has recently been reported that abnormalities in aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase (ARS) genes are linked to various unique leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies. Aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase proteins are fundamentally known as the first enzymes of translation, catalysing the conjugation of amino acids to cognate tRNAs for protein synthesis. It is known that certain aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase have multiple non-canonical roles in both transcription and translation, and their disruption results in varied and complicated phenotypes. We clinically and genetically studied seven patients (six male and one female; aged 2 to 12 years) from five unrelated families who all showed the same phenotypes of severe developmental delay or arrest (7/7), hypotonia (6/7), deafness (7/7) and inability to speak (6/7). The subjects further developed intractable epilepsy (7/7) and nystagmus (6/6) with increasing age. They demonstrated characteristic laboratory data, including increased lactate and/or pyruvate levels (7/7), and imaging findings (7/7), including calcification and abnormal signals in the white matter and pathological involvement (2/2) of the corticospinal tracts. Through whole-exome sequencing, we discovered genetic abnormalities in lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KARS). All patients harboured the variant [c.1786C>T, p.Leu596Phe] KARS isoform 1 ([c.1702C>T, p.Leu568Phe] of KARS isoform 2) either in the homozygous state or compound heterozygous state with the following KARS variants, [c.879+1G>A; c.1786C>T, p.Glu252-Glu293del; p.Leu596Phe] ([c.795+1G>A; c.1702C>T, p.Glu224-Glu255del; p.Leu568Phe]) and [c.650G>A; c.1786C>T, p.Gly217Asp; p.Leu596Phe] ([c.566G>A; c.1702C>T, p.Gly189Asp; p.Leu568Phe]). Moreover, similarly disrupted lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) proteins showed reduced enzymatic activities and abnormal CNSs in Xenopus embryos. Additionally, LysRS acts as a non-canonical inducer of the immune response and has transcriptional activity. We speculated that the complex functions of the abnormal LysRS proteins led to the severe phenotypes in our patients. These KARS pathological variants are novel, including the variant [c.1786C>T; p.Leu596Phe] (c.1702C>T; p.Leu568Phe) shared by all patients in the homozygous or compound-heterozygous state. This common position may play an important role in the development of severe progressive leukodystrophy. Further research is warranted to further elucidate this relationship and to investigate how specific mutated LysRS proteins function to understand the broad spectrum of KARS-related diseases. ?

"Clinical usefulness of a newly developed high-sensitive hepatitis b surface antigen (Hbsag) assay for monitoring hepatitis b reactivation",2019,"In order to demonstrate the evaluation of basic assessments and the clinical utility of a fully automated highly sensitive chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay for detecting hepatitis B surface antigen (Lumipulse Presto HBsAg-HQ), the HBsAg-HQ assay was compared to a conventional assay (HISCL HBsAg). The sensitivity of HBsAg-HQ (0.005 IU/mL) is approximately 6-fold higher than that of HISCL (0.03 IU/mL). The concordance rates between HBsAg-HQ and HISCL for 1,312 clinical sera were 99.6%; 5 samples were positive for only HBsAg-HQ. The specificity of HBsAg-HQ was 99.84% (1,256/1,258). Higher sensitivity of HBsAg-HQ was also confirmed with seroconversion panels and dilution tests of each genotype. Moreover, in 9/13 cases with HBV reactivation, HBsAg-HQ was able to detect HBsAg from the sera undetectable with HISCL, and 3 of them had earlier detection than HBV-DNA. Thus, HBsAg-HQ is more sensitive for detecting occult HBV infection and HBV reactivation in the early phase. ? 2019 The Japan Society of Hepatology.","hepatitis B surface antigen; Article; chemiluminescence immunoassay; comparative study; genotype; Hepatitis B virus; nonhuman; protein determination; sensitivity and specificity; virus reactivation"

She underwent mammography and ultrasonography, which showed an oval circumscribed mass and an irregular circumscribed heterogeneous solid mass, respectively. Following ultrasound-guided vacuum-assisted breast biopsy, this lesion was confirmed to be EPB. Whole-body computed tomography showed multiple new osteolytic lesions and other multiple extramedullary lesions in addition to EPB in the right breast.

"Novel risk loci identified in a genome-wide association study of urolithiasis in a Japanese population",2019,"Background A family history of urolithiasis is associated with a more than doubling of urolithiasis risk, and a twin study estimating 56% heritability of the condition suggests a pivotal role for host genetic factors. However, previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only six risk-related loci. Methods To identify novel urolithiasis-related loci in the Japanese population, we performed a large-scale GWAS of 11,130 cases and 187,639 controls, followed by a replication analysis of 2289 cases and 3817 controls. Diagnosis of urolithiasis was confirmed either by a clinician or using medical records or self-report. We also assessed the association of urolithiasis loci with 16 quantitative traits, including metabolic, kidney-related, and electrolyte traits (such as body mass index, lipid storage, eGFR, serum uric acid, and serum calcium), using up to 160,000 samples from BioBank Japan. Results The analysis identified 14 significant loci, including nine novel loci. Ten regions showed a significant association with at least one quantitative trait, including metabolic, kidney-related, and electrolyte traits, suggesting a common genetic basis for urolithiasis and these quantitative traits. Four novel loci were related to metabolic traits, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, or hyperuricemia. The remaining ten loci were associated with kidney- or electrolyte-related traits; these may affect crystallization. Weighted genetic risk score analysis indicated that the highest risk group (top 20%) showed an odds ratio of 1.71 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 2.06) - 2.13 (95% confidence interval, 2.00 to 2.27) compared with the reference group (bottom 20%). Conclusions Our findings provide evidence that host genetic factors related to regulation of metabolic and crystallization pathways contribute to the development of urolithiasis.

"Effects of menstrual cycle on background parenchymal enhancement and detectability of breast cancer on dynamic contrast-enhanced breast MRI: A multicenter study of an Asian population",2019,"Purpose: To evaluate the effect of the menstrual cycle on BPE and cancer detectability in an Asian population. Material and methods: 266 premenopausal patients with regular menstrual cycles from 24 centers were included, and 176 of them were diagnosed by pathology as having breast cancer. Thirty-five patients were examined in the menstrual phase (days 1–4), 105 in the proliferative phase (days 5–14), and 126 in the secretory phase (days 15–30). Measurement of the following signal intensities (SIs) were obtained: breast tissue on the unaffected side on a pre-contrast image (SI1) and an early-phase image (SI2); the SIs of breast tissue on the affected side on a pre-contrast image (SI3) and an early-phase image (SI4); and the SIs of breast cancer on a pre-contrast image (SI5) and an early-phase image (SI6). We calculated the BPE ratio, i.e., (SI2– SI1)/SI1 and the cancer/background enhancement ratio (C/B) ratio, i.e., (SI6– SI5) / (SI4– SI3). The BPE was classified as minimal, mild, moderate, or marked, and the cancer detectability was classified as excellent, good, or poor independently by two radiologists. Results: The average C/B ratio was 20.1, 15.7, and 9.1 at the menstrual, proliferative, and secretory phases (p &lt; 0.001). BPE was determined as moderate or marked in 0% and 5.4% at the menstrual phase, 10.3% and 11.0% at the proliferative phase, and 17.5% and 21.7% at the secretory phase by the two observers, respectively (p = 0.01, p = 0.01). The detectability of breast cancer was classified as poor in 0% and 0%, 1.4% and 13.0%, and 8.0% and 22.1% at the menstrual, proliferative, and secretory phases by the two observers, respectively (p = 0.07, p = 0.02). Conclusion: The menstrual phase and the proliferative phase seem to be suitable for breast MRI of Asian women. ? 2018","adult; Article; Asian; breast cancer; breast carcinoma; breast tissue; cancer diagnosis; disease severity; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; female; follicular phase; histopathology; human; human tissue; image analysis; image enhancement; major clinical study; menstrual cycle; menstruation; middle aged; multicenter study; parenchyma; premenopause; priority journal; prospective study; radiologist; secretory phase; aged; Asia; breast; breast tumor; clinical trial; early cancer diagnosis; ethnology; menstrual cycle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; physiology; procedures; young adult; contrast medium; Adult; Aged; Asia; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Contrast Media; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Menstrual Cycle; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Young Adult"
"No inflammatory benefit obtained by single-incision laparoscopic surgery for right hemicolectomy compared with conventional laparoscopy",2019,"Purpose: We evaluated the perioperative inflammatory mediators in a right hemicolectomy performed with single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) and traditional multi-port laparoscopic surgery (MLS) to compare the postoperative inflammatory response and feasibility of SILS with that of MLS. Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 56 consecutive colorectal cancer patients who underwent right hemicolectomy prospectively. Twenty patients underwent SILS, and 36 underwent MLS. The preoperative and postoperative levels of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as the number of platelet cells were measured in all patients. The operation duration, number of harvested lymph nodes, length of the resected bowel, blood loss, and duration of hospital stay were also compared between the two groups. Results: Neither SILS nor MLS had any conversion cases. The operation duration was longer for MLS than for SILS. Blood loss tended to be lower among patients who underwent SILS than among those who underwent MLS. However, the number of harvested LNs was significantly lower with SILS than with MLS. In both pre- and postoperative blood examinations, there was no marked difference in inflammatory mediators between MLS and SILS. Conclusion: There was no systemic inflammatory advantage associated with SILS compared with MLS. ? 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","C reactive protein; interleukin 6; vasculotropin; biological marker; C reactive protein; interleukin 6; vasculotropin A; aged; Article; cancer patient; colorectal cancer; comparative study; controlled study; female; hemicolectomy; hospitalization; human; laparoscopic surgery; lymph node; major clinical study; male; multi port laparoscopic surgery; operation duration; platelet count; postoperative complication; postoperative inflammation; protein blood level; retrospective study; single incision laparoscopic surgery; thrombocyte; blood; colon resection; feasibility study; laparoscopy; length of stay; operative blood loss; postoperative complication; procedures; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Blood Loss, Surgical; C-Reactive Protein; Colectomy; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Platelet Count; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A"
"Physical activity earlier in life is inversely associated with insulin resistance among adults in Japan",2019,"Background: It is known that physical activity affects glucose metabolism. However, there have been no reports on the influence of physical activity earlier in life on subsequent glucose metabolism. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of physical activity in earlier decades of life on insulin resistance in middle aged and older residents in Japan. Methods: The subjects were 6,883 residents of Okazaki City between the ages of 40 and 79 years who underwent physical examinations at the Okazaki City Medical Association Public Health Center from April 2007 through August 2011. They gave informed consent for participation in the study. Data on individual characteristics were collected via a questionnaire and from the health examination records. Fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were used to calculate the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). HOMA-IR >1.6 was considered to indicate insulin resistance for the purpose of logistic regression models. Results: The study sample included 3,683 men and 3,200 women for whom complete information was available. For those who exercised regularly throughout their teens to their 30s-40s, the odds ratio for having insulin resistance was 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.96) for men and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.58-0.99) for women after adjusting for other variables, including age, body mass index, and present physical activity. A linear trend was also observed in both men and women. Conclusions: Subjects who have exercised regularly in the early decades of life are less likely to have insulin resistance later in life. ? 2018 Hitomi Fujita et al.","adult; aged; exercise; female; human; insulin resistance; Japan; male; middle aged; Adult; Aged; Exercise; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Japan; Male; Middle Aged"
"Acidification effects on isolation of extracellular vesicles from bovine milk",2019,"Bovine milk extracellular vesicles (EVs) attract research interest as carriers of biologically active cargo including miRNA from donor to recipient cells to facilitate intercellular communication. Since toxicity of edible milk seems to be negligible, milk EVs are applicable to use for therapeutics in human medicine. Casein separation is an important step in obtaining pure EVs from milk, and recent studies reported that adding hydrochloric acid (HCl) and acetic acid (AA) to milk accelerates casein aggregation and precipitation to facilitate EV isolation and purification; however, the effects of acidification on EVs remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the acidification effects on milk-derived EVs with that by standard ultracentrifugation (UC). We separated casein from milk by either UC method or treatment with HCl or AA, followed by evaluation of EVs in milk serum (whey) by transmission electron microcopy (TEM), spectrophotometry, and tunable resistive pulse sensing analysis to determine EVs morphology, protein concentration, and EVs size and concentration, respectively. Moreover, we used anti-CD9, -CD63, -CD81, -MFG-E8, -HSP70, and -Alix antibodies for the detection of EVs surface and internal marker proteins by western blot (WB). Morphological features of EVs were spherical shape and similar structure was observed in isolated EVs by TEM. However, some of the EVs isolated by HCl and AA had shown rough surface. Although protein concentration was higher in whey obtained by UC, EV concentration was significantly higher in whey following acid treatment. Moreover, although all of the targeted EVs-marker-proteins were detected by WB, HCl-or AA-treatments partially degraded CD9 and CD81. These findings indicated that acid treatment successfully separated casein from milk to allow efficient EV isolation and purification but resulted in partial degradation of EV-surface proteins. Our results suggest that following acid treatment, appropriate EV-surface-marker antibodies should be used for accurate assess the obtained EVs for downstream applications. This study describes the acidification effects on EVs isolated from bovine milk for the first time. ? 2019 Rahman et al.

"Clinical characteristics of HNF1B-related disorders in a Japanese population",2019,"Background: Hepatocyte nuclear factor 1β (HNF1B), located on chromosome 17q12, causes renal cysts and diabetes syndrome (RCAD). Moreover, various phenotypes related to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) or Bartter-like electrolyte abnormalities can be caused by HNF1B variants. In addition, 17q12 deletion syndrome presents with multi-system disorders, as well as RCAD. As HNF1B mutations are associated with different phenotypes and genotype–phenotype relationships remain unclear, here, we extensively studied these mutations in Japan. Methods: We performed genetic screening of RCAD, CAKUT, and Bartter-like syndrome cases. Heterozygous variants or whole-gene deletions in HNF1B were detected in 33 cases (19 and 14, respectively). All deletion cases were diagnosed as 17q12 deletion syndrome, confirmed by multiplex ligation probe amplification and/or array comparative genomic hybridization. A retrospective review of clinical data was also conducted. Results: Most cases had morphological abnormalities in the renal–urinary tract system. Diabetes developed in 12 cases (38.7%). Hyperuricemia and hypomagnesemia were associated with six (19.3%) and 13 cases (41.9%), respectively. Pancreatic malformations were detected in seven cases (22.6%). Ten patients (32.3%) had liver abnormalities. Estimated glomerular filtration rates were significantly lower in the patients with heterozygous variants compared to those in patients harboring the deletion (median 37.6 vs 58.8?ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.0091). Conclusion: We present the clinical characteristics of HNF1B-related disorders. To predict renal prognosis and complications, accurate genetic diagnosis is important. Genetic testing for HNF1B mutations should be considered for patients with renal malformations, especially when associated with other organ involvement. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Nephrology.","genomic DNA; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta; HNF1B protein, human; Article; chromosome 17q; chromosome deletion; clinical feature; comparative genomic hybridization; diabetes mellitus; estimated glomerular filtration rate; gene mutation; genetic screening; genotype phenotype correlation; heterozygote; human; hydronephrosis; hyperparathyroidism; hyperuricemia; hypomagnesemia; Japanese (people); kidney calcification; kidney cyst; kidney hypoplasia; kidney malformation; missense mutation; multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification; neurological complication; next generation sequencing; point mutation; prognosis; retrospective study; schizophrenia; urinary tract malformation; adolescent; adult; Bartter syndrome; central nervous system disease; child; chromosome 17; chromosome deletion; disease exacerbation; enamel; gene deletion; genetic predisposition; genetics; heredity; infant; Japan; kidney polycystic disease; male; middle aged; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pedigree; phenotype; preschool child; risk factor; urogenital tract malformation; vesicoureteral reflux; Adolescent; Adult; Bartter Syndrome; Central Nervous System Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Dental Enamel; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Progression; Gene Deletion; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta; Heredity; Humans; Infant; Japan; Kidney Diseases, Cystic; Male; Middle Aged; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pedigree; Phenotype; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Urogenital Abnormalities; Vesico-Ureteral Reflux"
"Maternal Exposure to Housing Renovation During Pregnancy and Risk of Offspring with Congenital Malformation: The Japan Environment and Children’s Study",2019,"There have been no large, nationwide, birth cohort studies in Japan examining the effects of house renovation during pregnancy on congenital abnormality. This study examined the impact of (1) prenatal exposure to house renovation and (2) maternal occupational exposure to organic solvents and/or formaldehyde on the incidence of congenital abnormality. The fixed data of 67,503 singleton births from a large national birth cohort study that commenced in 2011 were used to evaluate the presence of congenital abnormalities and potential confounding factors. We employed multiple logistic regression analysis to search for correlations between maternal exposure to house renovation or organic solvents and/or formaldehyde during pregnancy and such congenital abnormalities as congenital heart disease, cleft lip and/or palate, male genital abnormality, limb defect, and gastrointestinal obstruction. After controlling for potential confounding factors, we observed that house renovation was significantly associated with male genital abnormality (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.03-3.17, P = 0.04) when stratified by congenital abnormality, with no other remarkable relations to house renovation or occupational use of organic solvents and/or formaldehyde during pregnancy. There were also significant correlations for maternal BMI before pregnancy, history of ovulation induction through medication, maternal diabetes mellitus/gestational diabetes mellitus, and hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with an increased risk of congenital abnormality. In conclusion, this large nationwide survey provides important information on a possible association of house renovation during pregnancy with congenital male genital abnormality which needs confirmation in future studies. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Clinical Implications of t(11;14) in Patients with Multiple Myeloma Undergoing Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation",2019,"Conventional cytogenetic analyses and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are helpful for stratifying patients with multiple myeloma (MM) into high-risk [t(4;14), t(14;16), and/or del 17p] and standard-risk [t(11;14)] categories. However, the prognosis of patients with MM treated with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) stratified according to these categories remains unclear. This retrospective observational study analyzed 97 patients with MM who received a single, planned ASCT after treatment with 200 mg/m 2 melphalan between 2001 and 2011. The patients were grouped according to chromosomal abnormality, including t(11;14) (n = 45), t(4;14) (n = 31), del 17p (n = 10), t(11;14) with del 17p (n = 7), and t(4;14) with del 17p (n = 4). Median overall survival (OS) of the t(11;14) group (64.1 months) was not significantly different from that of the t(4;14) group (not reached), but it was significantly longer than that of the del 17p group (23.0 months; P =.002). G-banding revealed that the median OS of the t(11;14) group with additional chromosomal abnormalities (ACAs) (46.2 months) was significantly shorter than that of the t(11;14) group without ACAs (not reached; P =.005) and the t(4;14) group (not reached; P =.010). These findings highlight the importance of G-banding in patients with t(11;14) MM. ? 2018 American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation","melphalan; adult; aged; Article; autologous stem cell transplantation; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cancer therapy; chromosome 11; chromosome aberration; chromosome deletion; chromosome G band; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; follow up; human; karyotype; major clinical study; male; multiple myeloma; observational study; overall survival; progression free survival; retrospective study; autotransplantation; chromosome 11; chromosome 14; gene translocation; genetics; hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; middle aged; multiple myeloma; prognosis; risk assessment; Adult; Aged; Chromosome Aberrations; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 11; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 14; Female; Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Translocation, Genetic; Transplantation, Autologous"
"Risk Factors for Pancreatic Stone Formation in Type 1 Autoimmune Pancreatitis: A Long-term Japanese Multicenter Analysis of 624 Patients",2019,"Objective Autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) has the potential to transform into chronic pancreatitis with pancreatic stone involvement. This retrospective investigation sought to clarify the risk factors for stone formation in type 1 AIP. Methods Questionnaires on patients with type 1 AIP were sent to 22 high-volume medical centers across Japan to compare the clinical features of patients with and without pancreatic stone formation. Results Of the completed records on 624 type 1 AIP patients, 31 (5%) had experienced pancreatic stones. Median follow-up duration was 1853 days. Bentiromide test values at diagnosis were significantly lower, and hemoglobin A1c values after corticosteroid treatment were significantly higher in patients with pancreatic stones. Imaging results disclosed that pancreatic atrophy and hilar or intrahepatic bile duct stenosis were significantly more frequent in patients with pancreatic stone formation. Pancreatic head swelling tended to be more frequent in this group as well. On the other hand, a shorter follow-up period was associated with the nonformation of pancreatic stones. Conclusions The increased frequency of pancreatic head swelling in type 1 AIP patients exhibiting pancreatic stones indicated a propensity for pancreatic juice stasis with subsequent stone development and pancreatic dysfunction occurring over longer periods of disease duration. ?

"Invasive ductal carcinoma arising in mucinous cystic neoplasm of pancreas: A case report",2019,"Objective: Rare co-existance of disease or pathology Background: Mucinous cystic neoplasm (MCN) of the pancreas is a rare mucin-producing cystic neoplasm that has a characteristic histological feature referred to as ovarian-type stroma (OS) underlying the epithelium. Pancreatic ductal carcinoma arises from MCN as a precursor lesion, but data on progression pathways are limited. Case Report: A 40-year-old female was referred to our hospital for further investigation of a pancreatic cyst. Further examination showed a 7.0 cm multilocular cyst in the pancreatic tail and a solid mass in the thick septum of the cystic tumor. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Histological examination revealed a moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with a diameter of 0.5 cm in the thick septum of the cystic lesion and a cyst wall composed of epithelium with low-grade to severe dysplasia. The epithelium covered an OS. Pathological diagnosis was IDC arising in MCN of the pancreas. Immunohistochemical examination showed that MUC1 expression was negative in MCN but positive in IDC. KRAS mutation was observed in both MCN and IDC regions. Conclusions: We present a rare case of moderately differentiated pancreatic IDC arising in MCN. To elucidate the underlying progression pathway, we explored the correlation between KRAS mutation and MUC expression as a clinicopathological parameter. ?

"Sinonasal inverted papilloma associated with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma: A case report and literature review of rare malignancies associated with inverted papilloma",2019,"We report a rare case of sinonasal inverted papilloma (IP) associated with small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (SNEC). To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe SNEC found during the treatment of sinonasal IP. Surgery and five cycles of cisplatin plus etoposide with concurrent intensity modulated radiation therapy were performed. Neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis was noted during 6 years of post-diagnostic follow-up. The prognosis of SNEC is very poor. Treatment planning for sinonasal IP should consider a possible association with this rare but aggressive malignancy, whose treatment is completely different from that of squamous cell carcinoma, a malignancy which is commonly associated with IP. We also performed a PubMed review of the literature to identify the incidence and pathological diagnosis of associated malignancy. Among a total of 5286 cases of sinonasal IP (61 studies), the incidence of associated malignancy was 8.02% in squamous cell carcinoma, 0.19% in transitional cell carcinoma, 0.04% in mucoepidermoid carcinoma, 0.02% in verrucous cell carcinoma and 0.02% in adenocarcinoma.

"Smartphone problem-solving therapy to reduce fear of cancer recurrence among breast cancer survivors: An open single-Arm pilot study",2019,"Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate a newly developed smartphone problemsolving therapy (PST) application's feasibility and preliminary effectiveness for reducing fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) among breast cancer survivors. Methods: Female disease-free breast cancer survivors aged 20-49 years who were more than 6 months post-breast surgery participated in the study. The patients received the smartphone PST using an iPhone or iPad for 8 weeks. The feasibility of the intervention program was evaluated using the overall participation rate, the percentage of survivors who expressed interest in the intervention, and the percentage of completion of the study. Patients were also asked to complete the Concern About Recurrence Scale (CARS) as a primary outcome at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Results: A total of 38 patients participated in this study. The overall participation and completion rates in the study were 47.1% and 97.4%, respectively. The overall fear assessed by CARS was significantly reduced at 8 weeks compared with baseline. A pairwise comparison showed a significant decrease from 4 weeks to 8 weeks and from baseline to 8 weeks. Conclusions: Smartphone PST, a novel brief intervention to reduce FCR, was well accepted by breast cancer survivors and yielded a favorable effect on FCR. The efficacy of this newly developed smartphone PST needs to be confirmed in a future well-designed randomized controlled trial. ? The Author(s) 2019.

"Plant Enzymes Decrease Prostate Cancer Cell Numbers and Increase TNF- α in Vivo: A Possible Role in Immunostimulatory Activity",2019,"Increased caloric intake and Westernized dietary choices may be contributing toward a recent rising trend of incidences of chronic lifestyle-related diseases. In this study, we evaluated the anticancer properties of Plant Enzyme Validux (PEV) using a mouse model. Five-week-old male C3H mice were randomly distributed into four experimental groups: Control, PEV only, 6Gy irradiation only, and PEV + 6Gy. PEV was orally administered daily at 500 mg/kg for 14 days prior to three rounds of 2Gy irradiation. We focused on the anticancer action and immunostimulatory effects of PEV with and without irradiation. Oncogene suppression was observed after PEV treatment as was an increase in TNF-α, suggesting an antitumor effect. PEV administration also appeared to reduce oxidative stress as evidenced by a decrease in lipid peroxidation. In addition, PEV confirmed radioprotective effect by radical blocking ability by radiation irradiation. Immunological responses to PEV administration were evidenced by an increase in number of total white blood cells and T lymphocytes. Immunotherapy is drawing more and more attention as a treatment for prostate cancer, suggesting that there will be a need for the identification of specific targets for prostate cancer and for more basic research on the genetic aspects of immunotherapy. Thus, PEV may be of use as a radioprotective supplement during radiotherapy for tumor treatment. ? 2019 Yeun-Hwa Gu et al.",""
"Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw after tooth extraction in cancer patients: a multicenter retrospective study",2019,"Summary: Root amputation, immunosuppressive therapy, mandibular tooth extraction, pre-existing inflammation, and longer duration of treatment with bone-modifying agents were significantly associated with an increased risk of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw. Hopeless teeth should be extracted without drug holiday before the development of inflammation in cancer patients receiving high-dose bone-modifying agents. Introduction: No studies have comprehensively analyzed the influence of pre-existing inflammation, surgical procedure–related factors such as primary wound closure, demographic factors, and drug holiday on the incidence of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the relationships between these various factors and the development of MRONJ after tooth extraction in cancer patients receiving high-dose bone-modifying agents (BMAs) such as bisphosphonates or denosumab. Methods: Risk factors for MRONJ after tooth extraction were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses. The following parameters were investigated in all patients: demographics, type and duration of BMA use, whether BMA use was discontinued before tooth extraction (drug holiday), the duration of such discontinuation, the presence of pre-existing inflammation, and whether additional surgical procedures (e.g., incision, removal of bone edges, root amputation) were performed. Results: We found that root amputation (OR = 22.62), immunosuppressive therapy (OR = 16.61), extraction of mandibular teeth (OR = 12.14), extraction of teeth with pre-existing inflammation, and longer duration (? 8?months) of high-dose BMA (OR = 7.85) were all significantly associated with MRONJ. Conclusions: Tooth extraction should not necessarily be postponed in cancer patients receiving high-dose BMA. The effectiveness of a short-term drug holiday was not confirmed, as drug holidays had no significant impact on MRONJ incidence. Tooth extraction may be acceptable during high-dose BMA therapy until 8?months after initiation. ? 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.","bisphosphonic acid derivative; denosumab; bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; denosumab; immunosuppressive agent; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; drug megadose; female; human; immunosuppressive treatment; incidence; incision; inflammation; jaw osteonecrosis; major clinical study; male; osteoporosis; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; tooth extraction; treatment duration; clinical trial; jaw osteonecrosis; middle aged; multicenter study; neoplasm; risk factor; surgery; tooth extraction; tooth root; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Denosumab; Diphosphonates; Female; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tooth Extraction; Tooth Root"
"Oncolytic activity of HF10 in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas",2019,"Recent developments in therapeutic strategies have improved the prognosis of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Nevertheless, 5-year survival rate remains only 40%, necessitating new therapeutic agents. Oncolytic virotherapy entails use of replication-competent viruses to selectively kill cancer cells. We aimed to explore the potential of HF10 as an oncolytic virus against human or mouse HNSCC cell lines, and primary-cultured HNSCC cells. HF10 replicated well in all the HNSCC cells, in which it induced cytopathic effects and cell killing. Next, we investigated the oncolytic effects of HF10 in ear tumor models with human or mouse tumor cells. We detected HF10-infected cells within the ear tumors based on their expression of green fluorescent protein. HF10 injection suppressed ear tumor growth and prolonged overall survival. In the syngeneic model, HF10 infection induced tumor necrosis with infiltration of CD8-positive cells. Moreover, the splenocytes of HF10-treated mice released antitumor cytokines, IL-2, IL-12, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, after stimulation with tumor cells in vitro. The HF10-treated mice that survived their original tumor burdens rejected tumor cells upon re-challenge. These results suggested that HF10 killed HNSCC cells and induced antitumoral immunity, thereby establishing it as a promising agent for the treatment of HNSCC patients. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",""
"Carfilzomib monotherapy in Japanese patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma: A phase 1/2 study",2019,"This multicenter, open-label phase 1/2 study evaluated single-agent carfilzomib in 50 heavily pretreated Japanese patients with relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (median of five prior treatments). In phase 1, patients were dosed at three levels: 15, 20, or 20/27?mg/m2. Maximum tolerated dosage was not reached at the tolerability evaluation. Patients in phase 2 were treated with 20/27?mg/m2 carfilzomib. Median duration of exposure to carfilzomib in the 20/27?mg/m2 group at this final analysis was 4.7?months (range: 0.3-39.4). Overall response rate in the 20/27?mg/m2 group, primary endpoint of the study, was 22.5% (n?=?9) (95% confidence interval, 12.3-37.5) with 2.5% (n?=?1) stringent complete response. Median progression-free survival and overall survival in the 20/27?mg/m2 group were 5.1?months (95% CI, 2.8-13.6) and 22.9?months (95% CI, 14.1-not estimable), respectively. Frequently occurring grade ?3 adverse events in the 20/27?mg/m2 group included lymphopenia (72.5%), neutropenia (40.0%), and leukopenia (32.5%). Giving long-term carfilzomib monotherapy led to long-term overall survival for heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients with a favorable safety profile. Carfilzomib monotherapy can be a good option for heavily pretreated multiple myeloma patients. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Independent and additive effects of PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphisms on the development of non-B, non-C hepatocellular carcinoma",2019,"Background: This study was aimed at evaluating the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the PNPLA3, NCAN, TM6SF2 and MBOAT7 and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in Thai patients according to underlying etiologies of liver disease. Methods: These SNPs were determined by allelic discrimination in blood samples of 105 healthy controls and 530 patients with HCC [270 with hepatitis B virus (HBV-HCC), 131 with hepatitis C virus (HCV-HCC), and 129 with non-B, non-C HCC (NBNC-HCC) matched for age and gender]. Results: G allele of PNPLA3 rs738409 variant was significantly higher in NBNC-HCC (49%) compared to healthy controls (32%), HBV-HCC (32%) and HCV-HCC (31%) (P < 0.001). T allele of TM6SF2 rs58542926 was more prevalent in NBNC-HCC (24%) than in healthy controls (8%), HBV-HCC (10%) and HCV-HCC (12%) (P < 0.001). The distribution of NCAN (rs2228603) and MBOAT7 (rs641738) was not different between groups. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, PNPLA3 rs738409 (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.24–3.43; P = 0.005) and TM6SF2 rs58542926 (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.34–3.65; P = 0.002) were independently associated with NBNC-HCC compared to viral-related HCC (VR-HCC). The proportion of patients with NBNC-HCC increased significantly along with the increase of the number of risk alleles. There was no association between these SNPs and overall survival in patients with HCC. Conclusions: These data showed that PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphisms were independently linked to NBNC-HCC but not HBV- or HCV-HCC in Thai populations. In addition, the risk genotypes might interact with each other through tumor development in patients with NBNC-HCC. ? 2018, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.","alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alcohol; bilirubin; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; allele; Article; bilirubin blood level; body mass; cancer risk; cancer survival; Child Pugh score; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drinking behavior; female; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; genotype; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oncogene; overall survival; platelet count; pnpla3 gene; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; tm6sf2 gene; tumor volume"
"Hepatitis C virus recurrence in two patients who achieved sustained viral response with interferon-free direct-acting antiviral therapy: reinfection or relapse?",2019,"We experienced two patients with chronic hepatitis C (HCV) in whom it was difficult to distinguish between relapse and reinfection after interferon-free direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. Case 1 was a 55-year-old man infected with HCV genotype 1b, at 5.6?log IU/mL, with a history of injecting drug use. He was treated with ombitasvir/paritaprevir/ritonavir for 12?weeks. After DAA therapy, recurrent HCV showed the genotype 2a differed from the baseline genotype. Close examination for baseline sample showed that he was coinfected with HCV genotype 1b and 2a. Case 2 was a 60-year-old woman with HCV2b, at 5.7?log IU/mL. She was treated with sofosbuvir/ribavirin for 12?weeks and achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) at 24?weeks. Even after SVR24, her serum alanine aminotransferase levels remained fluctuated. HCV RNA was detected again at 48?weeks. She had a sexual partner who was also infected with HCV2b. The phylogenetic tree analysis revealed a high degree of homology among the three strains: pre- and post-HCV treatment, and her partner. After HCV recurrence, HCV RNA level decreased spontaneously below the limit of detection and serum ALT levels normalized. It is important to make a precise diagnosis regarding reemerged HCV after DAA therapy. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.","alanine aminotransferase; glecaprevir; ombitasvir; paritaprevir; pibrentasvir; ribavirin; ritonavir; sofosbuvir; virus RNA; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; antiviral therapy; Article; case report; chronic hepatitis C; clinical article; concurrent sexual partnership; disease course; female; genotype; Hepatitis C virus; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; human; limit of detection; male; middle aged; mixed infection; phylogenetic tree; priority journal; reinfection; retreatment; sequence analysis; single nucleotide polymorphism; treatment failure"
"Evaluation of 8-week glecaprevir/pibrentasvir treatment in direct-acting antiviral-na?ve noncirrhotic HCV genotype 1 and 2infected patients in a real-world setting in Japan",2019,"Based on high efficacy and safety demonstrated in clinical trials, treatment with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (G/P) for 8?weeks is recommended for hepatitis C virus (HCV)–infected patients who are direct-acting antiviral (DAA) na?ve, genotype 1 or 2, and noncirrhotic. The aim of this study was to validate real-world experience with 8-week G/P treatment in Japan. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study in 554 patients who underwent 8-week treatment from among 1,022 patients who initiated G/P therapy. The majority (54.5%) were male, with a median age of 66?years, and HCV genotype distribution was genotype 1, 43.8%; genotype 2, 55.3%; and mixed subtype, 0.9%. Overall, the sustained virologic response rate at 12?weeks (SVR12) was 92.8% (530/571) in the intention-to-treat population and 99.3% (526/530) in the per-protocol population. The SVR12 rates by subgroups were as follows: subtype 1a, 100% (6/6); 1b, 100% (189/189); 2a, 99.3% (150/151); 2b, 99.0% (103/104); and mixed subtype, 50% (2/4). Among four patients with virologic failure following 8-week treatment with G/P, none had baseline polymorphisms or treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in NS3. However, 2 of 4 patients with virologic failure had treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in NS5A. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 21.5% of patients and 1.2% of patients discontinued due to drug-related AEs. In conclusion, G/P treatment for 8?weeks was safe and effective for DAA-na?ve noncirrhotic genotype 1 or 2 patients in a real-world clinical setting in Japan. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir; aged; amino acid substitution; antiviral therapy; Article; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; female; genetic polymorphism; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; human; Japan; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; sustained virologic response; unspecified side effect"
"Cost-effectiveness analysis of the pharmacological management of chronic low back pain with four leading drugs",2019,"Background: Chronic low back pain is a major health problem that has a substantial effect on people's quality of life and places a significant economic burden on healthcare systems. However, there has been little cost-effectiveness analysis of the treatments for it. Therefore, the purpose of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the pharmacological management of chronic low back pain. Methods: A total of 474 patients received pharmacological management for chronic low back pain using four leading drugs for 6 months at 28 institutions in Japan. Outcome measures, including EQ-5D, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, the JOA back pain evaluation questionnaire (BPEQ), the Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study SF-8, and the visual analog scale, were investigated at baseline and every one month thereafter. The incremental cost–utility ratio (ICUR) was calculated as drug cost over the quality-adjusted life years. An economic estimation was performed from the perspective of a public healthcare payer in Japan. Stratified analysis based on patient characteristics was also performed to explore the characteristics that affect cost-effectiveness. Results: The ICUR of pharmacological management for chronic low back pain was JPY 453,756. Stratified analysis based on patient characteristics suggested that the pharmacological treatments for patients with a history of spine surgery or cancer, low frequency of exercise, long disease period, low scores in lumbar spine dysfunction and gait disturbance of the JOA BPEQ, and low JOA score at baseline were not cost-effective. Conclusions: Pharmacological management for chronic low back pain is cost-effective from the reference willingness to pay. Further optimization based on patient characteristics is expected to contribute to the sustainable development of a universal insurance system in Japan. ? 2019 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association","celecoxib; loxoprofen; paracetamol; paracetamol plus tramadol; tramadol; analgesic agent; narcotic analgesic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; aged; Article; back pain evaluation questionnaire; clinical outcome; cost effectiveness analysis; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; female; follow up; health care cost; human; Japanese Orthopaedic Association score; low back pain; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; pharmacological parameters; prospective study; quality adjusted life year; questionnaire; Roland Morris disability questionnaire; Short Form 8; spine cancer; spine surgery; very elderly; visual analog scale; chronic pain; clinical trial; cost benefit analysis; disability; economics; fee; low back pain; middle aged; pain measurement; quality of life; Aged; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Analgesics, Opioid; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Chronic Pain; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Disability Evaluation; Fees, Pharmaceutical; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires"
"Automated Detection of Macular Diseases by Optical Coherence Tomography and Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning of Optical Coherence Tomography Images",2019,"Purpose. Although optical coherence tomography (OCT) is essential for ophthalmologists, reading of findings requires expertise. The purpose of this study is to test deep learning with image augmentation for automated detection of chorioretinal diseases. Methods. A retina specialist diagnosed 1,200 OCT images. The diagnoses involved normal eyes (n=570) and those with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (n=136), diabetic retinopathy (DR) (n=104), epiretinal membranes (ERMs) (n=90), and another 19 diseases. Among them, 1,100 images were used for deep learning training, augmented to 59,400 by horizontal flipping, rotation, and translation. The remaining 100 images were used to evaluate the trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Results. Automated disease detection showed that the first candidate disease corresponded to the doctor's decision in 83 (83%) images and the second candidate disease in seven (7%) images. The precision and recall of the CNN model were 0.85 and 0.97 for normal eyes, 1.00 and 0.77 for wet AMD, 0.78 and 1.00 for DR, and 0.75 and 0.75 for ERMs, respectively. Some of rare diseases such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease were correctly detected by image augmentation in the CNN training. Conclusion. Automated detection of macular diseases from OCT images might be feasible using the CNN model. Image augmentation might be effective to compensate for a small image number for training. ? 2019 Soichiro Kuwayama et al.",""
"Preventive effects of pneumococcal and influenza vaccines on community-acquired pneumonia in older individuals in Japan: a case-control study",2019,"At present, there are few reports that have clarified the effectiveness of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23) against all-cause pneumonia or pneumococcal pneumonia in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in older individuals in Japan. We conducted a hospital-based matched case-control study to investigate separately the preventive effects of PPSV23 and trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) on all-cause CAP and pneumococcal CAP in older individuals in Japan. Cases were individuals aged 65?years or older who were newly diagnosed with CAP from October 2010 to September 2014. Two control patients with a different disease (one respiratory medicine and one non-respiratory medicine) matched for sex, age, date of outpatient visit, and medical institution were selected for each case. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PPSV23 and TIV for the occurrence of all-cause CAP and pneumococcal CAP were calculated using conditional and unconditional logistic regression models. The analysis included 161 cases and 308 controls from the 4-year period. The adjusted OR for the occurrence of all-cause CAP was 0.76 (95%CI?=?0.44–1.32) with PPSV23 vaccination and 0.79 (95%CI?=?0.50–1.25) with TIV vaccination compared with unvaccinated individuals. When the outcome index was restricted to pneumococcal CAP, the adjusted OR significantly decreased to 0.23 (95%CI?=?0.08–0.66) with PPSV23 vaccination, but not with TIV vaccination (adjusted OR?=?0.65, 95%CI?=?0.31–1.36). PPSV23 vaccination is likely effective in reducing incidence of pneumococcal CAP in older individuals, although its preventive effect for all-cause CAP has not been achieved. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

"Effects of perioperative oral care on prevention of postoperative pneumonia after lung resection: Multicenter retrospective study with propensity score matching analysis",2019,"Background: Postoperative pneumonia can be a fatal complication that may occur after lung resection in cancer patients. Some reports have shown that the incidence of postoperative pneumonia is decreased after esophageal surgery by perioperative oral care; however, there exist no data to suggest that a lack of perioperative oral care can be a risk factor for postoperative pneumonia after lung resection. To investigate the association between the preventive effect of oral care and postoperative pneumonia, we conducted a multicenter, retrospective study of lung cancer patients who underwent lung resection. Methods: Between January 2014 and December 2016, a total of 721 patients underwent lung resections at 1 of the 6 hospitals included in our study. Among 721 patients, 280 (38.8%) received perioperative oral care, and the remaining 441 (61.2%) did not receive any such care. Propensity score matching was performed to minimize selection biases associated with the comparison of retrospective data between the oral care and control groups. Results: Of the 721 patients, 54 (7.5%) experienced postoperative pneumonia involving 13 of the 280 patients (4.6%) in the oral care group and 41 of the 441 patients (9.3%) in the control group (P = .02). On propensity score analysis, a significant difference was also found between oral care intervention and incidence of postoperative pneumonia (P = .002). Conclusion: Our results suggest that perioperative oral care is an effective method to decrease the occurrence of postoperative pneumonia in patients who have undergone lung resection. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","aged; Article; cancer patient; controlled study; disease association; female; human; incidence; lung cancer; lung resection; major clinical study; male; mouth hygiene; multicenter study; perioperative period; personal experience; postoperative complication; postoperative pneumonia; priority journal; propensity score; retrospective study; adverse event; clinical trial; lung resection; lung tumor; middle aged; perioperative period; pneumonia; postoperative complication; procedures; risk factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Oral Hygiene; Perioperative Care; Pneumonectomy; Pneumonia; Postoperative Complications; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome"
"Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma With Sialolithiasis of the Left Submandibular Gland: A Case Report and Literature Review",2019,"Adenoid cystic carcinoma is one of the most common salivary gland malignancies with poor long-term prognosis, but the coexistence of sialoliths is extraordinarily rare. In this article, we report a case of 30-year-old woman with a history of submandibular area swelling with intermittent pain increasing during mealtimes that had led her attending physician to diagnose a sialolith in the left submandibular gland on a radiograph 10 years before. However, the surgical specimen proved to be an adenoid cystic carcinoma accompanied with a sialolith. Histopathologically, the submandibular gland was displaced with a fibrous granulation tissue containing a small cribriform carcinoma invading the extracapsular region of the gland. We performed fluorescence in situ hybridization examination with an MYB-NFIB fusion probe of the lesion, with positive results. The patient underwent a supraomohyoid neck dissection as additional procedure because of the possibility of the extracapsular cancer nest remaining around the submandibular gland, but she remains well and disease free 11 years after the first operation. ?

"Effects of serum estradiol and progesterone on estrogen-regulated gene expression in breast cancers of premenopausal patients",2019,"Background: Expression of estrogen receptor α in breast cancer is essential for estrogen-dependent growth and partially determines the breast cancer subtype. In premenopausal women, expression of estrogen-regulated genes in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer tissues are reportedly influenced by the menstrual cycle. Methods: We investigated correlations between serum estradiol (E2; tested on the day of surgery) and expression of estrogen-regulated genes and proliferation genes in strongly estrogen receptor α-positive breast cancer tissues from 91 premenopausal women by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We also investigated correlations between serum progesterone levels on the day of surgery and mRNA expression of progesterone-regulated genes and proliferation genes. Results: The serum E2 level affected expression of estrogen-regulated genes, including progesterone receptor (P = 0.016, Rs = 0.07) but showed no correlation with expression of genes associated with proliferation. We also observed strong positive correlations between mRNA expression of ESR1 and that of estrogen-regulated genes (P < 0.0001, Rs = 0.329–0.756) and proliferation genes (P < 0.0001, Rs = 0.753–0.843). The serum progesterone level affected expression of RANKL mRNA. However, we observed no correlations between serum progesterone and expression of Wnt-4 or proliferation genes. Conclusions: The serum E2 level on the day of surgery influences estrogen-regulated gene expression moderately in patients found to be strongly positive for estrogen receptor α by immunohistochemistry. Changes in serum E2 levels might influence the results of molecular profiling tests in premenopausal women with breast cancer. ? The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

"Predicting directions of changes in genotype proportions between norovirus seasons in Japan",2019,"The norovirus forecasting system (NOROCAST) has been developed for predicting directions of changes in genotype proportions between human norovirus (HuNoV) seasons in Japan through modeling herd immunity to structural protein 1 (VP1). Here 404 nearly complete genomic sequences of HuNoV were analyzed to examine whether the performance of NOROCAST could be improved by modeling herd immunity to VP2 and non-structural proteins (NS) in addition to VP1. It was found that the applicability of NOROCAST may be extended by compensating for unavailable sequence data and observed genotype proportions of 0 in each season. Incorporation of herd immunity to VP2 and NS did not appear to improve the performance of NOROCAST, suggesting that VP1 may be a suitable target of vaccines.

"Factors influencing hospital admission among patients with autopsy-confirmed dementia",2019,"Background: The symptoms of geriatric syndromes and the behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), in addition to clinical conditions, are associated with hospital admission among dementia patients. However, the principal factors that necessitate hospital admission among dementia patients have not been fully elucidated. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data in the medical and autopsy reports of patients who had been treated at a hospital in Toyohashi, Japan. Each patient had been hospitalized sometime between 2012 and 2016 and underwent a brain autopsy. Dementia and the subtypes of dementia were diagnosed neuropathologically. Information about patients’ general backgrounds, clinical conditions at the time of admission, and the geriatric syndrome symptoms and BPSD before admission was collected; comparisons were then made between patients with and without dementia and among those with the different major subtypes of dementia. Then, the factors relating to hospital admission of dementia patients were comprehensively evaluated by using principle component analysis. Results: Of the 128 eligible patients, 100 (78.1%) had dementia. In the comparison of patients with and without dementia, patients without dementia were younger at both admission (P = 0.034) and death (P = 0.003). Among the patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, delusions had a significantly high prevalence (P = 0.014). Principal component analysis identified nine components (disinhibition, irritability/lability, agitation/aggression, anxiety, delusions, sleep/night-time behaviour disorders, hallucinations, aberrant motor behaviour, and speech impairment) as the principal factors related to hospital admission among dementia patients. Thus, BPSD were identified as principal factors. Conclusions: Compared to other factors, BPSD are more likely to cause dementia patients to be admitted to hospital. The present results indicate that measures should be taken to ameliorate the difficulties associated with caring for patients with BPSD at home. ? 2019 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society","age; aged; aggression; agitation; Alzheimer disease; anxiety disorder; apathy; Article; autopsy; bedridden patient; constipation; controlled study; daily life activity; death; delusion; dementia; diffuse Lewy body disease; disinhibition; female; frontotemporal dementia; gait disorder; geriatric disorder; hallucination; hospital admission; human; irritability; Japan; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental instability; motor dysfunction; multiinfarct dementia; observational study; priority journal; progressive supranuclear palsy; retrospective study; sleep disorder; speech disorder; urine incontinence; walking; wheelchair user; antisocial personality disorder; anxiety; autopsy; behavior; brain; delusion; dementia; hospital patient; hospitalization; neuropsychological test; pathology; prevalence; principal component analysis; psychology; restlessness; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Autopsy; Behavioral Symptoms; Brain; Delusions; Dementia; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Inpatients; Irritable Mood; Japan; Neuropsychological Tests; Prevalence; Principal Component Analysis; Psychomotor Agitation; Retrospective Studies; Social Behavior Disorders"
"Role of parenting style in children’s behavioral problems through the transition from preschool to elementary school according to gender in Japan",2019,"While ineffective discipline can be attributed to authoritarian and permissive parenting styles, little research has examined the role of gender in the association between parenting style and early childhood behavioral problems. Thus, this study aimed to clarify the effects of authoritarian and permissive parenting on children’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors during the preschool-to-elementary-school transition according to gender in Japan. A sample of 1668 Japanese children (853 boys and 815 girls) were followed longitudinally over one-year intervals, and assessed based on parenting styles (the Parenting Scale), children’s behavioral problems (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and family characteristics. Multivariate analyses revealed that, when analyzed by gender, authoritarian discipline influenced externalizing problems in boys (β = 0.048, p = 0.047) and girls (β = 0.067, p = 0.023), while permissive discipline influenced externalizing problems in boys only (β = 0.049, p = 0.038).

"A domain responsible for spontaneous conversion of bank vole prion protein",2019,"Bank vole is a small rodent that shows high susceptibility to infection with diverse prion strains. To determine whether the increased susceptibility of bank voles to prion diseases can be attributed to the intrinsic nature of bank vole prion protein (PrP) or to host factors other than PrP, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing bank vole PrP. These transgenic mice spontaneously developed neurological illness with spongiform changes and the accumulation of abnormal PrP in the brain. Then, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing chimeric mouse/bank vole PrP, which differs from mouse PrP only at two residues located at the C-terminus, to determine the minimum essential domain for the induction of spontaneous generation of abnormal PrP. These transgenic mice also developed spontaneous neurological illness with spongiform changes and the accumulation of abnormal PrP in the brain. In addition, knock-in mice expressing bank vole PrP at the same level as that of wild-type mice did not develop spontaneous disease but showed high susceptibility to infection with diverse prion strains, similarly to bank voles. Taken together, these findings show that bank vole PrP has a high propensity for the conformational conversion both in spontaneous disease and in prion infection, probably due to the characteristic structural properties of the C-terminal domain. ? 2018 International Society of Neuropathology","prion protein; prion protein; Prnp protein, mouse; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; gene overexpression; mouse; Myodes glareolus; nonhuman; prion disease; protein domain; amino acid sequence; animal; Arvicolinae; brain; disease model; disease predisposition; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; metabolism; prion; transgenic mouse; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Arvicolinae; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Susceptibility; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Prion Diseases; Prion Proteins; Prions"

"Laparoscopic extraperitoneal sigmoid colostomy using the totally extraperitoneal hernia repair technique after abdominoperineal resection for rectal cancer",2019,"Stoma creation through the extraperitoneal route reportedly reduces the risk of parastomal hernia and stomal prolapse after abdominoperineal resection (APR) for rectal cancer. We describe a new technique for laparoscopic extraperitoneal sigmoid colostomy following APR. After the rectus abdominis muscle is separated, Lap ProtectorTM and EZ AccessTM devices are placed. An extraperitoneal stoma tunnel is created laparoscopically as much as possible. Next, the peritoneum is separated from the inside of the abdominal cavity, and the extraperitoneal tunnel is opened. At the time of writing, we had performed laparoscopic extraperitoneal sigmoid colostomy in eight patients, without any complications or conversion to the conventional procedure. Thus, laparoscopic extraperitoneal sigmoid colostomy is a useful and safe technique for the laparoscopic creation of an extraperitoneal stoma tunnel after APR. ? 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Article; cancer surgery; clinical article; colostomy; follow up; hernioplasty; human; laparoscopic extraperitoneal sigmoid colostomy; laparoscopic surgery; mortality rate; parastomal hernia; rectum abdominoperineal resection; rectum cancer; rectus abdominis muscle; retrospective study; colostomy; hernia; herniorrhaphy; laparoscopy; peritoneum; postoperative complication; procedures; rectum; rectum resection; rectum tumor; sigmoid; stoma; treatment outcome; Colon, Sigmoid; Colostomy; Hernia; Herniorrhaphy; Humans; Laparoscopy; Peritoneum; Postoperative Complications; Proctectomy; Rectal Neoplasms; Rectum; Retrospective Studies; Surgical Stomas; Treatment Outcome"
"Immunohistochemistry for identification of CCND1, NSD2, and MAF gene rearrangements in plasma cell myeloma",2019,"The t(11;14)/CCND1-IGH, t(4;14)/NSD2(MMSET)-IGH, and t(14;16)/IGH-MAF gene rearrangements detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) are used for risk stratification in patients with multiple myeloma (MM). Compared with conventional FISH techniques using fresh cells, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is much more cost- and time-efficient, and can be readily applied to routinely prepared formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) materials. In this study, we performed tissue FISH and IHC employing FFPE specimens, and examined the usefulness of IHC as a tool for detecting CCND1, NSD2, and MAF gene rearrangements. CD138 signals were used to identify plasma cells in tissue FISH and IHC analyses. With cohort 1 (n?=?70), we performed tissue FISH and subsequently IHC, and determined IHC cut-off points. In this cohort, the sensitivity and specificity for the 3 molecules were ?.90 and ?.96, respectively. With cohort 2, using MM cases with an unknown gene status (n?=?120), we performed IHC, and the gene status was estimated using the cut-off points determined with cohort 1. The subsequent FISH analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity for the 3 molecules were ?.92 and ?.98, respectively. CCND1, NSD2, and MAF gene rearrangements were estimated accurately by IHC, suggesting that conventional FISH assays can be replaced by IHC. ? 2019 The Authors.

"Impact of ureteric stent removal by string on patient's quality of life and on complications at post-ureteroscopy for urolithiasis: a controlled trial",2019,"Objectives: To evaluate the impact of ureteric stent removal by string vs ureteric stent removal by cystoscope with regard to pain at ureteric stent removal, complications and quality of life, as well as patients’ self-rated symptoms, after ureteroscopy (URS) for urolithiasis. Patients and Methods: Of 328 patients who underwent URS for upper urinary tract stones at our institution, 149 were randomly divided into a ureteric stent removal by string group (string group) and a ureteric stent removal by flexible cystoscope group (cystoscope group), using gender as a stratification factor. We focused on four sites, namely, the upper abdomen, bladder, flank and urethra, to evaluate the most painful site at stent removal. The primary endpoint was total pain scores for four sites at stent removal in the string group vs the cystoscope group. Secondary endpoints included comparison of the psychological well-being scores of patients using the five-item World Health Organization well-being index (WHO-5) preoperatively, pre-stent removal and 2 weeks after stent removal between the string group and cystoscope group. Results: Of 149 patients analysed, 74 were in the string group and 75 were in the cystoscope group. In most patients, the ureteric stent was removed ~10 days after URS. The string group experienced significantly less pain than the cystoscope group (mean visual analogue scale [VAS] scores 2.73 vs 5.67; P < 0.001). Although VAS scores for women were not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.300), those for men were significantly lower in the string group (P < 0.001). In particular, men in the string group experienced significantly less urethral pain than those in the cystoscope group. The WHO-5 scores were not significantly different between the groups preoperatively, pre-stent removal or 2 weeks after stent removal. Stent string-related complications and self-rated symptoms were also not significantly different. Conclusion: Ureteric stent removal by string after URS led to significantly less pain than removal by cystoscope in men. Patients in the string group experienced no more complications in terms of urinary tract infections or accidental dislodgement than those in the cytoscope group. ? 2018 The Authors BJU International ? 2018 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","abdomen; adult; Article; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; controlled study; cystalgia; device removal; female; flank pain; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; pain assessment; preoperative care; priority journal; psychological well-being; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; self evaluation; sex difference; ureteral stenting; ureteroscopy; urethra discomfort; urethra disease; urethral pain; urinary tract infection; urolithiasis; visual analog scale; World Health Organization"
"Dual wavelength 5-aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy using a novel flexible light-emitting diode unit",2019,"Background: Photosensitizers used for photodynamic therapy (PDT) to treat dermatologic disease are metabolized into mainly protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), which has five absorption wavelength peaks: 410 nm, 510 nm, 545 nm, 580 nm, and 630 nm. Although only red light around 635 nm and blue light around 400 nm are used as light sources for PDT, the efficiency of PDT might be improved by using multiple wavelengths, including those that correspond to the other absorption peaks of PpIX. Furthermore, because the target disease often occurs on the face, a flexible-type light-source unit that can be fitted to the lesion without unnecessarily exposing the mucous membranes, e.g., the eyes, nostrils, and mouth, is preferred. Objective: We investigated the efficacy of a flexible light-emitting diode (LED) unit that emits multiple wavelengths to improve PDT effects. Methods: HaCaT cells were incubated with 5-ALA and subsequently irradiated with either a single wavelength or sequentially with two wavelengths. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species were analyzed. Nude mice were implanted with COLO679 cells by subcutaneous injection into the flank. 5-ALA was subcutaneously injected into the tumor. The tumor was irradiated with 50 J/cm 2 (day 0) and assessed daily until day 21. Results: The synergistic PDT effects of dual-wavelength irradiation and reactive oxygen species production were highest with the 405-nm and 505-nm wavelength combination. This dual wavelength combination was also the most effective in vivo. Conclusion: We could therefore conclude that dual-wavelength PDT is an efficient strategy for improving the therapeutic effects of PDT. Using a flexible LED unit is expected to achieve more uniform irradiation of uneven areas. ? 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology","aminolevulinic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; aminolevulinic acid; photosensitizing agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; HaCat cell line; human; human cell; in vivo study; light; melanoma; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; photodynamic therapy; priority journal; synergistic effect; therapy effect; tumor volume; animal; cell line; devices; drug effect; keratinocyte; metabolism; photochemotherapy; procedures; radiation response; Aminolevulinic Acid; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Humans; Keratinocytes; Mice, Nude; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Reactive Oxygen Species"
"Proton pump inhibitor monotherapy is effective to attenuate dyspepsia symptoms associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease: a multicenter prospective observational study",2019,"Background and aim: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and functional dyspepsia (FD) are frequently overlapped. However, no treatment strategies have been established yet for such patients. This study compared the effects of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment in patients with GERD-associated FD among three groups with varying severity levels of GERD symptoms. Methods: The patients with GERD and FD symptoms received PPI treatment for 4?weeks after endoscopy, and the severity of the symptoms and responses to treatment were evaluated at before and after 4?weeks of treatment using the Gastroesophageal Reflux and Dyspepsia Therapeutic Efficacy and Satisfaction Test (GERD-TEST). The patients were divided into three groups in accordance with the severity of the GERD symptoms as assessed by the GERD symptom subscale (SS) scores of pre-treatment. Results: Data from 233 cases of 40 mild, 151 moderate and 42 severe symptoms were analyzed. Analysis of the pre-treatment scores for each symptom revealed that a higher GERD-SS score was significantly associated with higher scores on any kind of FD score. Four weeks of PPI treatment significantly and markedly alleviated any of GERD/FD symptoms. Most importantly, change in the score for each symptom after 4 weeks of treatment relative to the pre-treatment score was significantly greater in the groups with more severe GERD-SS. Conclusion: FD symptoms associated with more severe GERD symptoms are supposed to be acid-related dyspepsia, and PPI monotherapy is recommended as the treatment of first choice in such patients. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.","esomeprazole; lansoprazole; omeprazole; rabeprazole; adult; Article; clinical outcome; disease severity; drug efficacy; dyspepsia; female; gastroesophageal reflux; gastroesophageal reflux and dyspepsia efficacy and satisfaction test; gastrointestinal endoscopy; gastrointestinal symptom; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; monotherapy; multicenter study; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; scoring system; treatment duration"
"New knowledge about old drugs; a cardenolide type glycoside with cytotoxic effect and unusual secondary metabolites from Digitalis grandiflora Miller",2019,"Phytochemical investigation of the aerial parts of Digitalis grandiflora Miller (Plantaginaceae) led to the isolation of an undescribed cardenolide type glycoside digigrandifloroside (1) along with five known compounds, rengyoside A (2), rengyoside B (3), cleroindicin A (4), salidroside (5), and cornoside (6), from its aqueous fraction of methanolic extract. Structures of the isolated compounds were determined by means of spectroscopic techniques. 1–6 were isolated for the first time from D. grandiflora. 2 and 3 are being reported for the first time from Digitalis genus and Plantaginaceae family with this study. This is the second report for occurrence of 4 from a Digitalis species. Cytotoxic activity of the aqueous fraction was also tested against HEp-2 (Human larynx epidermoid carcinoma) and HepG2 (Human hepatocellular carcinoma) cancer cell lines and L929 (Mouse fibroblast cell) non-cancerous cell line. Aqueous fraction showed stronger cytotoxicity on HEp-2 cells than HepG2. Therefore, the cytotoxic activity of 1, 2, 4, and 6 were tested against HEp-2 and L929 cell lines. 3 and 5 couldn't be tested due to their insufficient amount. 1 showed the highest cytotoxicity against HEp-2 cells with IC 50 value 10.1 μM when compared with the positive control, etoposide and 2–6 (IC 50 of etoposide; 39.5 μM). ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","antineoplastic agent; cardenolide; cleroindicin a; cornoside; digigrandifloroside; drug metabolite; etoposide; rengyoside; rengyoside b; salidroside; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; cardenolide; digitalis; glycoside; phytochemical; animal cell; aqueous solution; Article; controlled study; cytotoxicity; Digitalis grandiflora; drug effect; drug isolation; drug structure; HEp-2 cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; mouse; NCTC clone 929 cell line; nonhuman; Plantaginaceae; priority journal; spectroscopy; aerial plant part; animal; chemistry; isolation and purification; secondary metabolism; tumor cell line; turkey (bird); Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Cardenolides; Cell Line, Tumor; Digitalis; Glycosides; Humans; Mice; Phytochemicals; Plant Components, Aerial; Secondary Metabolism; Turkey"
"Incidence of C5 Palsy: Meta-Analysis and Potential Etiology",2019,"Background: Among the proposed hypotheses for C5 palsy, the most acceptable etiologies have been the tethering effect of the spinal nerve or reperfusion injury of the spinal cord. We performed a meta-analysis to determine a potential etiology of C5 palsy. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to 2017 for relevant studies of the incidence of C5 palsy after cervical decompression surgery. Relevant incident estimates of C5 palsy stratified by the surgical approach and underlying diagnosis were calculated using an appropriate meta-analysis. Results: A total of 107 studies were included for our meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of C5 palsy was 0.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00–0.01) for anterior decompression in patients with radiculopathy, 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03–0.05) for anterior decompression and 0.07 (95% CI, 0.06–0.08) for posterior decompression in patients with myelopathy. A two-tailed t test with unequal variance accepted the null hypothesis of no differences in the incidence between anterior and posterior decompression in patients with myelopathy (P = 0.999) and rejected the hypothesis of no differences in the incidence between the patients with radiculopathy and myelopathy in anterior decompression (P < 0.001). Conclusions: With no significant difference found in the incidence of C5 palsy between anterior and posterior cervical decompression in patients with myelopathy, the tethering effect of the spinal nerve might not be a plausible etiology for C5 palsy. In contrast, we found a significantly greater incidence of C5 palsy in patients with myelopathy compared with those with radiculopathy undergoing anterior decompression, which might support the reperfusion injury of the spinal cord as the etiology of C5 palsy. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Article; decompression surgery; human; incidence; meta analysis; radiculopathy; reperfusion injury; spinal cord disease; spinal nerve; spinal paralysis; surgical approach; cervical vertebra; clinical trial (topic); paralysis; pathology; procedures; prospective study; retrospective study; risk factor; spinal cord disease; spinal root; trends; Cervical Vertebrae; Clinical Trials as Topic; Decompression, Surgical; Humans; Incidence; Paralysis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Spinal Cord Diseases; Spinal Nerve Roots"
"Randomized controlled trial of Web-based weight-loss intervention with human support for male workers under 40",2019,"Objectives: Human support can boost weight reduction in Internet-based weight-loss intervention. However, the most effective way to combine human support and the Internet for weight loss is unclear. This study aimed to examine the effects of two weight-loss programs for male workers aged 18-39 that combined different intensities of human support with website support compared to a delayed-intervention group (control group; CG), in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Seventy-one participants with overweight or obesity were allocated to one of three 12-week treatment programs. The Standard Support Group (SSG) was provided support via website and two face-to-face group guidance sessions, at the beginning and at the end of the program along with monthly general emails throughout the program. The Enhanced Support Group (ESG) received four remote support sessions based on Supportive Accountability (SA) in addition to the SSG. The CG was provided the same program as SSG after the other two groups had completed the program. The primary outcome was body weight reduction. Results: ESG participants reduced their weight significantly more than SSG and CG participants (P = 0.038, P < 0.001, respectively), and SSG participants reduced their weight significantly more than CG participants (P = 0.033). Conclusions: The additional remote human support provided to the participants in the ESG was beneficial for weight loss in male workers. The low-intensity program provided to the SSG was also effective. Further studies with more participants in diverse settings and with participants who are less interested in their health and weight management are needed. ? 2019 Japan Society for Occupational Health.","adult; analysis of variance; body mass; body weight; body weight loss; controlled study; human; Internet; Japan; male; obesity; psychology; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; social support; young adult; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Humans; Internet; Japan; Male; Overweight; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Weight Loss; Young Adult"
"The angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker azilsartan can overwhelm the sympathetic nerve activation stimulated by coadministration of calcium channel blockers",2019,"Objective: In our recent study, non-Gaussianity of heart rate variability (λ25s), an indicator of sympathetic nerve activity, did not change during two-day treatment with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (ARB) azilsartan. Coadministration of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) might affect the study results. Methods: In this subanalysis, 20 patients with chronic kidney disease (14 men; age 61±15 years) were divided into three groups: patients with coadministration of L-type CCB, patients without coadministration of CCB, and patients with coadministration of sympathoinhibitory (L/T- or L/T/N-type) CCB. λ25s was calculated separately in daytime and nighttime. Results: Daytime λ25s at baseline was higher in patients with L-type CCB coadministration (0.62±0.18, n = 5) compared with those without CCB (0.49±0.13, n = 11) and those with sympathoinhibitory CCB (0.46±0.06, n = 4). The relationship between the changes in daytime λ25s and systolic blood pressure was positive in patients with L-type CCB coadministration, whereas the relationship was inverse in the other two groups. A larger decrease in daytime λ25s was shown in patients with L-type CCB coadministration compared with those in the other two groups. Conclusions: CCBs, as well as diuretics, are recommended as second-line antihypertensive agents. Our results suggested that ARBs can overwhelm the activation of sympathetic nerve activity stimulated by coadministration of L-type CCBs. ?

"Factors determining parenting stress in mothers of children with atopic dermatitis",2019,"Background: Atopic dermatitis (AD) influences a child's emotional and social well-being, as well as his or her physical health. The influence of AD on the daily lives of parents and caregivers has also been documented. This study examined how parenting stress is affected by demographic background, characteristics of children's AD, and their family systems. Methods: The participants were mothers of children, aged 2–6 years old, who had been diagnosed with AD. The predictive power of a model of parenting stress was examined using multiple regression analysis (stepwise), with parenting stress (PSI-SF) as the dependent variable, and children's demographics, including characteristics of AD; parents’ demographics; QoL of families of children with AD (JCMV-CADIS); and family functioning (FAI) as independent variables. We handled missing values using a multiple imputation method. Results: The pooled coefficients obtained from the multiple regression analysis after multiple imputation indicated that “family cohesion,” “family system flexibility,” “emotions related to social factors” and “occupation of mother” determined parenting stress. Lower family cohesion and family system flexibility predicted higher parenting stress. The high impact of “emotions related to social factors” on families’ QoL predicted higher parenting stress. Full-time work by mothers predicted lower parenting stress. Conclusions: The current results reveal that “family cohesion,” “family system flexibility,” “emotions related to social factors” and “full-time work by mothers” predicted parenting stress of mothers who had children with AD. ? 2018 Japanese Society of Allergology","Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; clinical feature; demography; disease severity; emotion; family; family assessment; Family Assessment Inventory; family functioning; female; food allergy; full time employment; human; Japanese Culturally Modified version of Childhood Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale; major clinical study; male; occupation; parental stress; Parenting Stress Index Short Form; priority journal; quality of life; skin disease assessment; social aspect; social status; atopic dermatitis; child parent relation; family relation; mental stress; mother; preschool child; psychology; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Male; Mothers; Parenting; Stress, Psychological"
"Effects of chewing gum on differential components of psychomotor vigilance : IImproved sustained attention with prolonged reaction time",2019,"Although chewing gum improves cognitive functions including attention, memory, alertness, and executive functions, recent studies reported that chewing gum during a cognitive task can differently affect the components of cognitive functions. We examined the effects of taste-and-flavor-free chewing gum on behavioral alertness assessed by psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) in 13 healthy adults. They performed 5-min PVT for three times; before, during the last 5 min of 8-min gum chewing, and 3 min after ceasing it. Sustained attention evaluated as the number of lapses (>1000 ms) improved both during and after chewing gum (P = 0.01). Although marginally significant shortening of overall reaction time to stimuli (RT) was observed both during and after chewing gum (P = 0.05), the fastest 10th percentile RT (RT without the influence of lapses) lengthened only during chewing gum. Our observations suggest that chewing gum may improve sustained attention but elongate reaction time. ? 2018 IEEE.","Brain; Human reaction time; Attention; Chewing gum; Cognitive functions; Differential component; Executive function; Prolonged reaction; Psychomotor vigilance tests; Sustained attention; Pattern recognition"

"Eicosapentaenoic acid suppresses angiogenesis via reducing secretion of IL?6 and VEGF from colon cancer?associated fibroblasts",2019,"Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) improves interleukin (IL)-6 hypercytokinemia in patients with advanced cancer due to its anti?inflammatory effects. This EPA mechanism has been revealed to lead to several anticancer effects. While the effects of EPA on cancer cells have been investigated, particularly in terms of angiogenesis, its effects on the tumor stroma remain unclear. In the present study, the authors clarified the role of EPA in cancer angiogenesis against colon cancer?associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from the colon stroma. With established human CAFs and normal fibroblasts from colon stroma (NFs), the authors evaluated IL?6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion with or without EPA treatment using ELISA. The signal inhibition of mitogen?activated protein kinase (ERK) in CAFs by EPA was evaluated using western blotting. In vitro anti?angiogenesis effects were evaluated by the angiogenesis assay on Matrigel using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured with the supernatant obtained from CAF cultures with or without EPA. IL?6 secretion was greater from CAFs compared with that from NFs and stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in greater IL?6 secretion from the two fibroblast types compared with that from fibroblasts without LPS stimulation. While LPS stimulation increased VEGF secretion from the two fibroblast types, EPA decreased IL?6 and VEGF secretion from CAFs. Western blotting revealed that the addition of 30 ?M EPA inhibited the ERK phosphorylation signal in CAFs. Furthermore, the angiogenesis assay with Matrigel revealed that the CAF culture supernatants treated with EPA suppressed tubular formation in HUVECs. These reductions may have been caused by the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by EPA. Thus, EPA reduces cancer angiogenesis associated with CAFs. Additional studies will be needed to clarify the continuous anti?angiogenetic effect of chemotherapy using angiogenesis inhibitors (e.g. bevacizumab and aflibercept) in conjunction with or without EPA, and the clinical usage of EPA in conjunction with chemotherapy in vivo. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

"Classic chronic pancreatitis is associated with prior acute pancreatitis in only 50% of patients in a large single-institution study",2019,"Background: The sentinel acute pancreatitis event (SAPE) hypothesis for pathogenesis of chronic pancreatitis (CP) postulates that acute pancreatitis (AP), especially recurrent AP (RAP), precedes development of CP. However, in a recent population-based study, 52/89 (58.4%) of CP had no prior episodes of AP. In a large clinic-based CP cohort, we aimed to determine the incidence and timing of prior AP in patients diagnosed with CP. Methods: We retrospectively identified 499 consecutive patients with classic CP diagnosed at our institution from January 2013 through December 2015. We abstracted their demographic and clinical data, especially regarding prior AP. Results: We identified 3 cohorts: 1) CP with no AP (n = 231 [46.3%]), 2) AP before CP (n = 250 [50.1%]), and 3) AP after CP (n = 18 [3.6%]). At CP diagnosis, 249 patients (49.9%) had no prior AP. Compared with the “CP preceded by AP” cohort, the “CP without AP”’ cohort was older (59.2 ± 13.9 vs 48.6 ± 15.7 years; P <.001), had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (30.3% vs 12.4%; P <.001), reported less pain (52.8% vs 87.6%; P <.001), and had a lower rate of endoscopic interventions (16.0% vs 39.2%; P <.001). In the “CP preceded by AP” cohort, 117 (46.8%) had a single episode of AP and 133 (53.2%) had RAP. Conclusion: Nearly half the patients with classic CP did not have prior AP. Only a quarter of patients had CP that could potentially have evolved from prior RAP. Development of CP may be attributable to an altogether different pathogenesis (a non-SAPE pathway) for a considerable proportion of patients. ? 2019 IAP and EPC","acute pancreatitis; adult; alcoholism; Article; body weight loss; chronic pancreatitis; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; disease association; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic ultrasonography; exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; female; follow up; human; idiopathic disease; incidence; jaundice; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; pancreas function test; pancreas surgery; pathogenesis; prevalence; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; smoking; symptom; aged; chronic pancreatitis; pathology; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors"
"Usefulness of intraoperative nerve monitoring in esophageal cancer surgery in predicting recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy and its severity",2019,"Background: Recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy is a critical postoperative complication in esophageal cancer surgery. However, intraoperative prediction of its occurrence and severity is difficult. In this prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) in predicting RLN palsy and its severity. Methods: Twenty patients who underwent subtotal esophagectomy with 3-field lymph node dissection were enrolled. Intraoperative electromyography (EMG) amplitudes of the vocal cords were measured by IONM at RLN and vagus nerve (VN) stimulation. Comparison was made between the vocal cords with RLN palsy and those without palsy and additionally between the vocal cords with transient RLN palsy and those with persistent palsy. Results: Among 40 vocal cords in 20 patients, 26 were intact and 14 were paralyzed. Seven had transient, six had permanent palsy. The mean EMG amplitude of intact vocal cords was significantly larger than that of paralyzed ones at VN (506 ± 498??V vs. 258 ± 226??V, p = 0.022) and RLN stimulation (642 ± 530??V vs. 400 ± 308??V, p = 0.038). The cut-off value for postoperative palsy were 419??V [positive predictive value (PPV): 48.0%, negative predictive value (NPV): 84.6%] at VN and 673??V (PPV: 44.8%, NPV: 90.9%) at RLN stimulation. The mean EMG amplitude of persistently paralyzed vocal cords tended to be small, compared with that of recovered ones at both VN (168 ± 173??V vs. 336 ± 266??V, p = 0.11) and RLN (244 ± 223??V vs. 536 ± 344??V, p = 0.051) stimulation. Conclusion: The absolute EMG amplitude of IONM might be helpful to predict the occurrence and severity of RLN palsy after esophageal surgery although the predictive value is low. ? 2019, The Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery.","antineoplastic agent; action potential amplitude; aged; Article; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; clinical trial; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; electromyography; esophagus cancer; esophagus resection; female; human; intraoperative monitoring; lymph node dissection; male; nerve; open surgery; postoperative complication; predictive value; preoperative chemotherapy; prospective study; recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy; sensitivity and specificity; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; vocal cord paralysis; adverse event; electromyography; esophagus resection; esophagus tumor; injury scale; intraoperative monitoring; peroperative complication; receiver operating characteristic; recurrent laryngeal nerve injury; vocal cord paralysis; Aged; Electromyography; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophagectomy; Female; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Intraoperative Complications; Male; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injuries; ROC Curve; Vocal Cord Paralysis"
"Changes in the association between postpartum depression and mother-infant bonding by parity: Longitudinal results from the Japan Environment and Children's Study",2019,"The results of several epidemiological studies have shown a moderate association between postpartum depression (PPD) and mother-infant bonding (MIB); however, associations and changes that longitudinally considered parity were not reported. We investigated the possible association between PPD and MIB at one month after birth, in addition, the changes of these indices by parity. From a dataset comprising 103,099 maternal registrations in The Japan Environment and Children's Study, the present study analyzed complete data on questionnaires for 76,363 women who participated once (cross-sectional group) and 3753 women who participated twice (follow-up subgroup). Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores and the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale-Japan (MIBS-J) scores were obtained one month after delivery. We identified the two factors of the MIBS-J, “lack of maternal feeling (LMF)” and “anxiety about caregiving (AC)” through confirmatory factor analysis. Associations between total EPDS and each factor of MIBS-J were evaluated using multiple regression analyses after adjusting for potential confounders. Total EPDS and both factors (LMF and AC) were positively related in the cross-sectional group (fully adjusted β = 0.26 and 0.39 for LMF and AC, respectively), in the follow-up subgroup at first participation (0.24 and 0.40, respectively) and at the second participation (0.25 and 0.39, respectively). Multiple regression analyses revealed a robust, moderate relationship between postpartum depression and mother-infant bonding. PPD and MIB scores were shown to decrease from the first child to the second in the follow-up subgroup. Consequently, interventions which would increase a mother's child care experience and expertise would prevent PPD and improve MIB. ? 2018 The Authors","alcohol consumption; anxiety; Article; child care; cohort analysis; confirmatory factor analysis; cross-sectional study; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; female; follow up; human; infant; Japan; Japanese (people); maternal age; medical history; mother; mother child relation; obstetric delivery; parity; postnatal depression; prevalence; priority journal; smoking"
"Efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir–velpatasvir with or without ribavirin in HCV-infected Japanese patients with decompensated cirrhosis: an open-label phase 3 trial",2019,"Background: In Japan, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients with decompensated cirrhosis currently have no treatment options. In this Phase 3 study, we evaluated sofosbuvir–velpatasvir with or without ribavirin for 12?weeks in patients with any HCV genotype and decompensated cirrhosis [Child–Pugh–Turcotte (CPT) class B or C] in Japan. Methods: Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive sofosbuvir–velpatasvir with or without ribavirin for 12?weeks. Randomization was stratified by CPT class and genotype. Sustained virologic response 12?weeks following completion of treatment (SVR12) was the primary efficacy endpoint. Results: Of the 102 patients enrolled, 57% were treatment naive, 78% and 20% had genotype 1 and 2 HCV infection, respectively, and 77% and 20% had CPT class B and C cirrhosis, respectively, at baseline. Overall, 61% of patients were female and the mean age was 66?years (range 41–83). SVR12 rates were 92% (47/51) in each group. Among patients who achieved SVR12, 26% had improved CPT class from baseline to posttreatment week 12. Most adverse events (AEs) were consistent with clinical sequelae of advanced liver disease or known toxicities of ribavirin. Four patients (8%) who received sofosbuvir–velpatasvir and seven (14%) who received sofosbuvir–velpatasvir plus ribavirin experienced a serious AE. The 3 deaths (bacterial sepsis, gastric varices hemorrhage, hepatocellular carcinoma) were attributed to liver disease progression. Conclusion: Sofosbuvir–velpatasvir for 12?weeks provides a highly effective and well-tolerated therapy for Japanese patients with HCV and decompensated cirrhosis. Ribavirin did not improve efficacy but increased toxicity. ? 2018, The Author(s).","bilirubin; hemoglobin; ribavirin; sofosbuvir plus velpatasvir; antivirus agent; carbamic acid derivative; fused heterocyclic rings; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; sofosbuvir-velpatasvir drug combination; adult; aged; anemia; antiviral therapy; Article; bilirubin blood level; bleeding; Child Pugh score; controlled study; decompensated liver cirrhosis; diarrhea; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; genotype; hemoglobin blood level; hepatitis C; human; hyperglycemia; Japan; Japanese (people); liver cell carcinoma; liver function; lymphocyte count; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; open study; platelet count; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rhinopharyngitis; sepsis; side effect; stomach varices; sustained virologic response; treatment duration; clinical trial; comparative study; drug combination; genetics; Hepacivirus; hepatitis C; liver cirrhosis; middle aged; phase 3 clinical trial; treatment outcome; very elderly; virology; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antiviral Agents; Carbamates; Drug Combinations; Female; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C; Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings; Humans; Japan; Liver Cirrhosis; Male; Middle Aged; Ribavirin; Sofosbuvir; Sustained Virologic Response; Treatment Outcome"
"Review of high-risk factors and adjuvant chemotherapy indication in t4-pstage II colon cancer",2019,"Background: T4 is one of the high-risk factors, but the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy for T4-Stage II colon cancer are unclear. Method: We retrospectively reviewed 211 patients with primary pStage II colon cancer who underwent radical resection between 2004 and 2015. Results: The 5-year overall survival rate (OS) of Stage HA/DB/IIC were 90.2/83.4/59.2%, and the 5-year recurrence-free survival rate (RFS) were 87.3/73.3/42.8%. Multivariate analysis of OS as a high-risk factor of T4 revealed male, ly2/3, no adjuvant chemotherapy, and in RFS, male, ly2/3. However, compared the cases with or without adjuvant chemotherapy, 5-year OS was no difference. There were no cases used oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Conclusion: An adjuvant chemotherapy without oxaliplatin were not enough to improve the prognoses of T4-Stage D colon cancer, so the oxaliplatin based regimen might be recommended. ? 2019 Japanese Journal of Cancer and Chemotherapy Publishers Inc..

"Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms of HAAO and IRX6 Genes as Risk Factors for Hypospadias",2019,"Purpose:We evaluated the association of hypospadias and 17 susceptibility loci previously identified by a European genome-wide association study in a cohort of Japanese patients. We also examined the expression of candidate genes in male mouse embryos to determine the possible underlying mechanisms of this disease.Materials and Methods:We enrolled 169 Japanese patients (mean age at surgery 3.7 years) who underwent repair of hypospadias. Genotyping of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms was performed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction invader assay. We also performed in situ hybridization to determine whether candidate genes were expressed in the male genital tubercle during embryonic development of the external genitalia in mice.Results:Single nucleotide polymorphism rs3816183 of HAAO was significantly associated with susceptibility to hypospadias in general (p = 0.0019) and to anterior/middle hypospadias (p = 0.0283) and posterior hypospadias (p = 0.0226), while single nucleotide polymorphism rs6499755 of IRX6 showed an association with susceptibility to anterior/middle hypospadias (p = 0.0472). In mouse embryos there was no significant upregulation of Haao expression in the developing male external genitalia. Irx3 and Irx5, which are linked to Irx6 within the IrxB cluster, were expressed in the mesenchyme remote from the urethral plate epithelium during the critical embryonic period for masculinization. Irx6 was expressed in the ectodermal epithelium, demonstrating prominent dorsal ectodermal expression without expression in the ventral ectoderm adjacent to the urethral plate during the same period.Conclusions:Genetic variations of HAAO and IRX6 influence susceptibility to hypospadias in the Japanese population. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism by which variations in these genes contribute to the pathogenesis of hypospadias. ? 2019 by AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, INC.","messenger RNA; 3 hydroxyanthranilate 3,4 dioxygenase; homeodomain protein; IRX6 protein, human; Irx6 protein, mouse; transcription factor; allele; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; ectoderm; embryo; embryo development; expression quantitative trait locus; gene; gene expression; genetic association; genetic variation; genital system; genome-wide association study; genotype; HAAO gene; hypospadias; in situ hybridization; IRX3 gene; IRX5 gene; IRX6 gene; IRXB gene; Japanese (people); male; mesenchyme; mouse; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; priority journal; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; upregulation; adolescent; animal; Asian continental ancestry group; child; gene expression regulation; genetic predisposition; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; hypospadias; infant; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; Japan; mammalian embryo; metabolism; newborn; organogenesis; preschool child; single nucleotide polymorphism; urethra; 3-Hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-Dioxygenase; Adolescent; Animals; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Child; Child, Preschool; Ectoderm; Embryo, Mammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Hypospadias; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Organogenesis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Transcription Factors; Urethra"

"Inhibition of interleukin 10 transcription through the Smad2/3 signaling pathway by Ca21-activated K1channel KCa3.1 activation in human T-cell lymphoma HUT-78 cells s",2019,"The hyperpolarization induced by intermediate-conductance Ca21-activated K1channel (KCa3.1) activation increases the driving force for Ca21influx, which generally promotes cell proliferation, migration, and cytokine production in immunocom-petent cells. Interleukin-10 (IL-10) from tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages, lymphoma, and carcinoma cells facilitates escape from cancer immune surveillance; however, the role of KCa3.1 in IL-10 production remains unclear.

"Placental growth factor is a predictive biomarker for ramucirumab treatment in advanced gastric cancer",2019,"Purpose: Ramucirumab (RAM) has been used as the second-line standard chemotherapy for advanced gastric cancer (AGC) either alone or combination with paclitaxel (PTX). However, no predictive biomarkers have been identified for RAM treatment in AGC. Methods: We retrospectively identified 26 patients who received either RAM monotherapy or RAM + PTX therapy for AGC refractory to fluoropyrimidine and platinum agents from 2015 to 2018?at Nagoya City University Hospital. First, we extracted RNA using gastric cancer (GC) tissues from two responders and two non-responders, and then analyzed 24 VEGFR-related angiogenic genes. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between the expression of each angiogenic gene and RAM clinical activity in the entire cohort. Finally, we validated using in vitro angiogenesis assays using GC cells and microvascular endothelial cells. Results: We identified five angiogenic genes with aberrant expression between RAM responders and non-responders and placental growth factor (PlGF) was the most significant gene among them. Overall survival (P = 0.046) and progression-free survival (P = 0.016) were significantly shorter in the PlGF-high group than in the PlGF-low group. Overall response rates were 50% in the PlGF-low group and 0% in the PlGF-high group. In GC cells co-cultured with endothelial cells, PlGF gene silencing from GC cells significantly reinforced the inhibitory effect of RAM in the in vitro angiogenesis assay (tube formation assay and endothelial migration) through the inactivation of ERK, in comparison to the control GC cells. Conclusions: PlGF gene expression in gastric cancer tissues could be a predictive indicator of AGC treatment by RAM. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","biological marker; cisplatin; docetaxel; fluoropyrimidine; mitogen activated protein kinase; oxaliplatin; paclitaxel; placental growth factor; plxnd1 protein; ramucirumab; RNA; sema3b protein; semaphorin 3F; trastuzumab; unclassified drug; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin receptor; antineoplastic agent; monoclonal antibody; paclitaxel; PGF protein, human; placental growth factor; ramucirumab; tumor marker; adult; advanced cancer; aged; angiogenesis assay; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; clinical article; coculture; controlled study; endothelium cell; enzyme inactivation; female; gastric cancer cell line; gene expression; gene identification; gene silencing; human; human tissue; in vitro study; male; monotherapy; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; retrospective study; RNA extraction; stomach cancer; treatment response; cohort analysis; comparative study; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; neovascularization (pathology); pathology; stomach tumor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Paclitaxel; Placenta Growth Factor; Retrospective Studies; Stomach Neoplasms"
"The antiviral effects of human microRNA miR-302c-3p against hepatitis B virus infection",2019,"Background: Conventional treatments of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection rarely achieve a decline of serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels and eradication of the virus. Aim: To elucidate the antiviral mechanisms of a human microRNA, miR-302c-3p, against HBV replication. Methods: The antiviral effect of miR-302c-3p was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by transfecting the miR-302c-3p mimic into HBV-infected HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells and HBV transgenic mice respectively. Results: miR-302c-3p decreased not only HBV replication but also production of HBsAg. Pregenomic RNA and HBsAg mRNA concentrations decreased in the cells treated with miR-302c-3p. Interestingly, the amount of cccDNA was significantly reduced in the miR-302c-3p-treated cells, in association with disappearance of the HBV core protein. An RNA immunoprecipitation assay showed that miR-302c-3p decreased the binding of the HBV polymerase to the pregenomic RNA by hybridising with the ε-loop region. A number of host genes were downregulated in miR-302c-3p-treated cells, including BMPR2 and HNF4A. Knockdown of these two genes by corresponding siRNAs also suppressed HBV replication and HBsAg secretion. The antiviral effect of miR-302c-3p was also observed in HBV transgenic mice. Conclusions: miR-302c-3p had anti-HBV activity, in vitro and in vivo, via several mechanisms. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",""
"Treatment of a malignant soft tissue tumor arising in the vicinity of the sciatic nerve with an in-situ preparation technique and intensive multidisciplinary therapy",2019,"Preservation of the sciatic nerve is difficult in cases of highly malignant soft tissue tumors closely surrounding the nerve. Herein, we present the first case of preservation of this nerve by combining an in-situ preparation technique (ISP; a technique enabling the preparation of neurovascular bundles without contamination by tumor cells) with intensive concurrent neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy with hyperthermia (RHC; radio-hyperthermo-chemotherapy). A 62-year-old man presented with a soft tissue mass in the right thigh and was diagnosed with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. The tumor arose in the multi-compartment areas of the posterior thigh muscles and was closely intertwined with the sciatic nerve. As preoperative therapy, RHC was performed for surgical down-staging and the tumor partially responded. Afterwards, wide resection of the tumor with preservation of the sciatic nerve using ISP was performed. Following the surgery, there has not been recurrence in the affected site and the functional outcomes of the lower extremity achieved 80% in the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score. The patient is still alive with disease five years postoperatively. This is the first case in which ISP and RHC procedures were combined for the preservation of the neurovascular structure. Further study is needed for the validation of the feasibility of this method. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Correlation between eosinophil count, its genetic background and body mass index: The Nagahama Study",2020,"Background: Obesity affects the pathogenesis of various chronic diseases, including asthma. Research on correlations between obesity/BMI and eosinophilic inflammation in asthma has yielded contradictory results, which could be partly ascribed to the absence of epidemiological data on the correlations. We aimed to elucidate the correlations between blood eosinophil count, its genetic backgrounds, and BMI in the general population. Methods: This community-based Nagahama study in Japan enrolled 9789 inhabitants. We conducted self-reporting questionnaires, lung function tests, and blood tests in the baseline and 5-year follow-up studies. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 4650 subjects at the baseline and in 4206 of these at the follow-up to determine single-nucleotide polymorphisms for elevated blood eosinophil counts. We assessed the correlations between BMI and eosinophil counts using a multifaceted approach, including the cluster analysis. Results: Eosinophil counts positively correlated with BMI, observed upon the interchange of an explanatory variable, except for subjects with the highest quartile of eosinophils (?200/μL), in whom BMI negatively correlated with eosinophil counts. GWAS and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) imputation identified rs4713354 variant (MDC1 on chromosome 6p21) for elevated eosinophil counts, independent of BMI and IgE. Rs4713354 was accumulated in a cluster characterized by elevated eosinophil counts (mean, 498 ± 178/μL) but normal BMI. Conclusions: Epidemiologically, there may be a positive association between blood eosinophil counts and BMI in general, but there was a negative correlation in the population with high eosinophil counts. Factors other than BMI, particularly genetic backgrounds, may contribute to elevated eosinophil counts in such populations. ? 2019 Japanese Society of Allergology","DNA; hemoglobin A1c; immunoglobulin E; low density lipoprotein; adult; aged; Article; asthma; body mass; cluster analysis; correlational study; eosinophil; eosinophil count; eosinophilia; female; follow up; gene frequency; gene identification; genetic background; genome-wide association study; human; Japan; lung function test; major clinical study; major histocompatibility complex; male; medical history; obesity; physical examination; population; principal component analysis; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism"
"Status and trends in the use of insulin analogs, insulin delivery systems and their association with glycemic control: Comparison of the two consecutive recent cohorts of Japanese children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus",2019,"Treatment for type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) has greatly changed by the general use of insulin analogs and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII). To investigate whether these advances have been translated into continued improvement in glycemic control in Japanese children and adolescents, we analyzed the registration data of the two consecutive recent cohorts of Japanese childhood-onset T1DM patients. The registration data including hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ), hypoglycemia and insulin regimen were compared between the two cohorts (862 patients in the 2008 cohort and 1090 in the 2013 cohort). The proportion of subjects with multiple daily insulin injection therapy (MDI) and CSII significantly increased (p&lt;0.0001) from 67.4% and 9.7% to 71.8% and 23.4%, respectively. In the 2013 cohort, almost all patients were treated with basal-bolus treatment using insulin analogs. The use of CSII increased in all age groups, especially in the age group 0-5 years. The rates of overall, moderate and severe hypoglycemia significantly declined from 10.24, 10.18 and 0.056 events/100 persons/period in the 2008 cohort to 0.66, 0.62 and 0.033 in the 2013 cohort (p&lt;0.0001, &lt;0.0001, 0.04), respectively. Contrarily, there were no significant changes in HbA 1c values between the two cohorts. The popularization of the basal-bolus treatment using insulin analogs hascontributed to a significant decrease in hypoglycemia. In contrast, the intensive insulin treatment may not be enough for the satisfactory improvement of glycemic control in Japanese children and adolescents with T1DM. Considerable points remain, such as diabetic education and support to motivate patients. ? 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","hemoglobin A1c; antidiabetic agent; biological marker; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; insulin; adolescent; adult; Article; attitude to health; bolus injection; child; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; female; glycemic control; health status; human; hypoglycemia; incidence; infant; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin infusion; insulin treatment; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; patient satisfaction; trend study; analogs and derivatives; analysis; follow up; glucose blood level; hyperglycemia; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin infusion; newborn; preschool child; prognosis; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Insulin; Insulin Infusion Systems; Male; Prognosis; Young Adult"
"Mass media exposure and childhood diarrhea: A secondary analysis of the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey",2019,"In order to reduce child mortality, recommendations for diarrhea management practices have been widely promoted by various methods, including mass media. This study examined whether mother's exposure to mass media was associated with child's diarrhea, and with the diarrhea management practiced by their mothers. Data on 7,068 women, whose youngest child was under five years old, were extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2011, together with information on the child. The outcome variables were an episode of diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the survey and diarrhea management practices; exposure to mass media was used as the major explanatory variable. They were descriptively summarized, and logistic regression analyses were performed. Television was found to be the most common form of media. Among 346 children who had experienced an episode of diarrhea in the previous 2 weeks, less than 42.5% were given zinc and only 26.3% of the mothers provided sufficient fluids. No significant associations between mother's mass media exposure and child's diarrhea were observed. Women who read newspapers/magazines were more likely to provide sufficient fluids and food, and those exposed to the radio were more likely to provide zinc supplementation. Since mother's exposure to newspaper/magazines and radio showed associations with some recommended practices for the treatment of childhood diarrhea, mass media clearly has the potential to improve diarrhea management practices. More effective use of mass media is anticipated; in particular, promotion of zinc supplementation and increasing fluid intake during diarrhea, neither of which were currently well practiced. ? 2018, Nagoya University.","adolescent; adult; Bangladesh; child; demography; diarrhea; female; fluid therapy; health survey; human; male; mass medium; middle aged; statistical model; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Bangladesh; Child; Demography; Diarrhea; Female; Fluid Therapy; Health Surveys; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mass Media; Middle Aged; Young Adult"
"What is the appropriate communication style for family members confronting difficult surrogate decision-making in palliative care?: A randomized video vignette study in medical staff with working experiences of clinical oncology",2019,"Background: The family members of terminally ill patients are often requested to make difficult surrogate decisions during palliative care. This study sought to clarify the appropriate communication style for physicians as perceived by family members confronting difficult surrogate decision-making. Methods: This experimental psychological study used scripted videos. In the videos, the physician described treatment options including continuous deep sedation to the family members of patients with cancer and terminal delirium using an autonomous or paternalistic style. Medical professionals with clinical experience in oncology were randomly assigned to either group viewing the videos. The primary outcomes were physician compassion, decisional conflict and emotion scores. We also evaluated the communication style preference. Results: In total, 251 participants completed this study. Although participants in both groups reported high physician compassion, participants in the autonomous style group reported lower compassion scores (reflecting higher physician compassion) (mean 15.0 vs. 17.3, P = 0.050), lower decisional conflicts scores (51.1 vs. 56.8, P = 0.002) and comparable emotions compared with those in the paternalistic style group. Seventy-six percent of participants preferred the autonomous style. Conclusions: Regarding difficult surrogate decision-making, the autonomous style might be more appropriate than the paternalistic style. However, various factors, such as family members’ communication style preferences, family members’ values, physician–family relationships and ethnic cultures, should be considered. ?

"Real-world efficacy of adalimumab and infliximab for refractory intestinal Beh?et's disease",2019,"Background: Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents are important for managing refractory intestinal Beh?et's disease. Few studies have reported the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies for intestinal Beh?et's disease due to its rarity. Aims: The aim was to examine the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies for intestinal Beh?et's disease in real-world practice. Methods: This was a retrospective review of medical records at 4 hospitals in Japan. Global gastrointestinal symptom and endoscopic assessment scores were analyzed in intestinal Beh?et's disease patients given anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents at 3 and 12 months after the start of therapy. Results: Of 53 intestinal Beh?et's disease patients, 22 received anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibody treatment. At the first line, 14 were given adalimumab, and 8 were given infliximab. After 3 and 12 months of treatment, 7 and 11 patients showed complete response of gastrointestinal symptom scores, respectively, and 5 and 9 showed complete remission of the endoscopic assessment score, respectively. Three patients switched anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents. Conclusion: Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies are effective for refractory intestinal Beh?et's disease in real-world situations. Switching anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents may be useful for failure of first-line anti-tumor necrosis factor-α therapy in some refractory cases. ? 2019 Editrice Gastroenterologica Italiana S.r.l.","adalimumab; azathioprine; colchicine; cyclosporine; infliximab; mercaptopurine; mesalazine; prednisolone; adalimumab; infliximab; tumor necrosis factor; abdominal discomfort; abdominal pain; Article; Behcet disease; bloating; controlled study; diarrhea; disease duration; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; endoscopy; enteropathy; female; follow up; gastrointestinal symptom; human; maintenance drug dose; major clinical study; male; medical record review; priority journal; remission; retrospective study; treatment response; ulcer healing; adolescent; adult; aged; Behcet disease; clinical trial; enteropathy; immunology; Japan; middle aged; multicenter study; recurrent disease; treatment outcome; young adult; Adalimumab; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Behcet Syndrome; Female; Humans; Infliximab; Intestinal Diseases; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Recurrence; Remission Induction; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha; Young Adult"
"Study of complete genome sequences of Rotavirus a epidemics and evolution in Japan in 2012-2014",2019,"A comprehensive molecular epidemiological study using next-generation sequencing technology was conducted on 333 rotavirus A (RVA)-positive specimens collected from six sentinel hospitals across Japan over three consecutive seasons (2012-2014). The majority of the RVA isolates were grouped into five genotype constellations: Wa-like G1P[8], DS-1-like G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8] and G9P[8]. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the distribution of strains varied by geographical locations and epidemic seasons. The VP7 genes of different G types were estimated to evolve at 7.26 × 10-4-1.04 × 10-3 nucleotide substitutions per site per year. The Bayesian time-scaled tree of VP7 showed that the time to the most recent common ancestor of epidemic strains within a region was 1-3 years, whereas that of the epidemic strains across the country was 2-6 years. This study provided, for the first time, the timeframe during which an epidemic strain spread locally and within the country and baseline information needed to predict how rapidly RVAs spread. ? 2007 - 2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

"Prognostic Risk Analyses for Postcardiotomy Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation in Children: A Review of Early and Intermediate Outcomes",2019,"We evaluated the morbidity and mortality of children requiring postcardiotomy extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) to determine independent factors affecting early and intermediate outcomes. Between January 2002 and December 2015, 79 instances of ECMO after cardiac surgery in 73 children were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up was completed in December 2016. Predictive risk analyses were employed concerning weaning of ECMO, hospital discharge, and mortality after discharge. Age and weight were 14.9 ± 25.6?months and 7.0 ± 5.3?kg, respectively. Median support time was 8.3 ± 4.4?days. Sixty-seven (85%) were successfully weaned off ECMO and 48 (61%) survived to hospital discharge. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis identified the first day to obtain negative fluid balance after initiation of support (adjusted odds ratio = 0.42), high serum lactate levels (0.97), and high total bilirubin (0.84) during support as significant independent factors associated with successful separation from ECMO. The first day of negative fluid balance (0.65) after successful decannulation was an independent risk factor for survival to hospital discharge. After hospital discharge, actuarial 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were 94%, 78%, and 78%, respectively. Low weight increased the risk of death after hospital discharge by a multi-variate Cox hazard model. High serum lactate, high serum bilirubin, and unable to obtain early negative fluid balance during support impacted mortality of decannulation. Obtaining a late negative fluid balance in post-ECMO were independent risk factors for death after successful weaning. Low weight affected intermediate outcomes. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","bilirubin; lactic acid; bilirubin; lactic acid; age distribution; Article; bilirubin blood level; body weight; cannulation; cardiopulmonary arrest; child; controlled study; critically ill patient; extracorporeal oxygenation; female; fluid balance; follow up; heart surgery; hospital discharge; human; lactate blood level; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; morbidity; mortality; mortality risk; odds ratio; outcome assessment; postoperative period; prediction; prognosis; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; risk factor; sex difference; survival rate; blood; extracorporeal oxygenation; heart surgery; hospital mortality; infant; preschool child; risk assessment; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Bilirubin; Body Weight; Cardiac Surgical Procedures; Child; Child, Preschool; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Infant; Lactic Acid; Male; Odds Ratio; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Survival Rate"
"Factor structure of the Japanese version of the Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QOL-AD)",2020,"Background: The Quality of Life in Alzheimer's Disease Scale (QOL-AD) developed by Logsdon et al. in1999 is believed to be useful for evaluating responses from both patients and their caregivers. We previously confirmed both the reliability and the validity of the Japanese version of the QOL-AD. However, the factor structure of this scale should be confirmed because the QOL-AD covers multiple facets of dementia patients’ lives. Thus, we performed a factor analysis of the Japanese QOL-AD. Then, we examined the correlations between each of the identified QOL factor scores and the results of other scales. Methods: The Japanese version of the QOL-AD was given to 132 AD patients and 132 caregivers. Four other tests were also performed at the same time: the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale (HADL), and the Short Memory Questionnaire. A factor analysis using Varimax rotation was used to examine the dimensions underlying the QOL-AD. In addition, we examined the Pearson correlations between each of the identified QOL factor scores and the results of the other four tests. Results: Factor analyses of both versions of the Japanese QOL-AD (both the patients’ and the caregivers’ responses) revealed three factors that were named ‘psychological wellbeing’, ‘human relationships’, and ‘physical and social environment’. The ‘psychological wellbeing’ factor was significantly correlated with the Mood factor of the NPI. The ‘human relationships’ factor was significantly correlated with the Psychosis factor of the NPI. The ‘physical and social environment’ factor was significantly correlated with the HADL. Conclusions: Both the patients’ and the caregivers’ responses to the Japanese version of the QOL-AD were composed of three factors: ‘psychological wellbeing’, ‘human relationships’, and ‘physical and social environment’. The present results support the multi-domain concept of QOL proposed by Lawton. ? 2019 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society","aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; correlational study; female; human; human relation; Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale; Japanese (language); language; major clinical study; male; Mini Mental State Examination; mood; neuropsychiatric inventory; priority journal; psychological well-being; psychosis; Quality of Life in Alzheimer Disease Scale; questionnaire; rating scale; risk factor; Short Memory Questionnaire; social environment"

"Safe resection margin in video-assisted left anterior and lingular segmentectomy for an impalpable lung nodule",2019,"Introduction: The nodule located at the left anterior segment near the lingular segment is traditionally resected by left upper lobectomy. We performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)segmentectomy and could achieve a complete resection that is minimally invasive and oncologically sufficient. Presentation of case: An 82-year-old woman was found to have a nodule in the left anterior segment of the lung on chest computed tomography (CT). The nodule was 1.9 cm in size and strongly suspected to be lung carcinoma. No suspicious regions of metastasis were observed; thus, we diagnosed stage IA2 and decided to perform anterior and lingular segmentectomy by VATS. Discussion: Because of the location, the tumor is traditionally resected by left upper lobectomy. However, we planned a minimally invasive intervention and performed anterior and lingular segmentectomy by VATS using a CT-guided nodule marking prior to the surgery. Conclusion: This technique resulted in complete tumor resection with minimal adverse effects. ? 2019 The Author(s)","aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer surgery; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; female; histopathology; human; lingular segmentectomy; lung carcinoma; lung nodule; lung resection; maximum standardized uptake value; medical history; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; operation duration; positron emission tomography; priority journal; segmentectomy; surgical margin; surgical patient; very elderly; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery"

The isolates were collected from clinical specimens obtained from well-diagnosed adult patients with respiratory tract infections during the period between January 2014 and April 2015 by three societies. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted at the central reference laboratory according to the method recommended by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Susceptibility testing was evaluated in 1534 strains (335 Staphylococcus aureus, 264 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 29 Streptococcus pyogenes, 281 Haemophilus influenzae, 164 Moraxella catarrhalis, 207 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 254 Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Ratio of methicillin-resistant S. aureus was 43.6%, and those of penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae was 100%. Among H. influenzae, 8.2% of them were found to be β-lactamase-producing ampicillin-resistant strains, and 49.1% to be β-lactamase-non-producing ampicillin-resistant strains.

"Liposuction for autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells: Preliminary results of donor-site complications in male stress urinary incontinence",2019,"Objectives: Liposuction is now applied to harvest autologous adipose-derived regenerative cells in the regenerative medicine. Although liposuction is highly safe for females who generally have larger fat deposits, liposuction has some potential risks for donor-site complications in the case of aged male patients. The purpose of our study was to review the complications of liposuction of the aged male patients who have undergone cell therapy for stress urinary incontinence. Methods: Sixteen male patients (mean age, 74 years old) with persistent stress urinary incontinence were included in this study. Approximately 250 mL of adipose tissue was harvested using a syringe attached to the cannula. Postoperative complications were recorded and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Results: Average liposuction time was 57.4 min. No major complications were observed. However, there were some minor complications: bruising, numbness, contour irregularities, firmness, and scarring. These complications were CTCAE Grade 1 in all cases. The complications, except for the scarring, became unnoticeable within 6 months in all cases. Conclusion: Liposuction takes time and has some minor donor-site complications for stem cell therapy in aged male stress urinary incontinence patients. ? 2019 The Authors","hemoglobin; adipose tissue; adipose tissue cell; aged; Article; autologous adipose derived regenerative cell; autologous stem cell transplantation; bacterial infection; body contouring; clinical article; disease severity; donor site complication; follow up; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypertrophic scar; liposuction; lung embolism; male; operation duration; paresthesia; postoperative complication; remission; scoring system; skin bruising; stress incontinence; subcutaneous hemorrhage; surgical risk; very elderly"
"Bevacizumab combined with platinum–taxane chemotherapy as first-line treatment for advanced ovarian cancer: a prospective observational study of safety and efficacy in Japanese patients (JGOG3022 trial)",2019,"Background: This was the first large-scale prospective observational Japanese study evaluating the safety and efficacy of bevacizumab combined with paclitaxel and carboplatin for newly diagnosed advanced ovarian cancer. Methods: Patients were prospectively enrolled in the primary analysis cohort if they had Stage III or IV epithelial ovarian/fallopian tube/primary peritoneal cancer and were scheduled to receive paclitaxel plus carboplatin every 3?weeks in Cycles 1–6 and bevacizumab every 3?weeks in Cycles 2–22. Primary endpoints were bevacizumab-specific adverse events and adverse events ? Grade 3. Secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and the response rate. Results: Among 346 patients enrolled, 293 patients formed the primary analysis cohort. Regarding bevacizumab-specific adverse events ? grade 3, incidence rates of thromboembolic events (1.4%), gastrointestinal perforation (0.3%), fistula (0.7%), wound dehiscence (0%), and bleeding (0%) were very low. While incidence rates of hypertension (23.2%) and proteinuria (12.6%) were high, all such events were tolerable. No patient with prior bowel resection developed perforation or fistula. Median PFS was 16.3?months (95% CI 14.5–18.9). The response rate was 77.5% (95% CI 67.4–85.7). The response rate was 63.6% in patients with clear cell carcinoma, which tended to be better than previously reported. The median platinum-free interval was 11.5?months, and the platinum-resistant recurrence rate was 24.5%. Conclusions: Combining bevacizumab with chemotherapy was tolerable and efficacy was acceptable in Japanese patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. Bevacizumab seems to reduce platinum-resistant recurrence and is promising for clear cell carcinoma. ? 2018, The Author(s).","bevacizumab; carboplatin; paclitaxel; antineoplastic agent; bevacizumab; carboplatin; docetaxel; paclitaxel; adult; advanced cancer; aged; allergic reaction; anemia; Article; bleeding; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer survival; clear cell carcinoma; cohort analysis; digestive system perforation; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; endometrioid carcinoma; fatigue; febrile neutropenia; female; fistula; human; hypertension; intestine resection; Japanese (people); major clinical study; malaise; multiple cycle treatment; nausea; neutropenia; observational study; ovary cancer; ovary carcinoma; peripheral neuropathy; peritoneum cancer; primary tumor; priority journal; progression free survival; prospective study; proteinuria; recurrence risk; thrombocytopenia; thromboembolism; uterine tube carcinoma; venous thromboembolism; wound dehiscence; adenocarcinoma; colloid carcinoma; cystadenocarcinoma; endometrium tumor; Japan; middle aged; ovary tumor; pathology; prognosis; safety; survival rate; tumor recurrence; very elderly; young adult; Adenocarcinoma, Clear Cell; Adenocarcinoma, Mucinous; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Bevacizumab; Carboplatin; Cystadenocarcinoma, Serous; Docetaxel; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Japan; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Ovarian Neoplasms; Paclitaxel; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Safety; Survival Rate; Young Adult"
"Dummy-run for standardizing plan quality of intensity-modulated radiotherapy for postoperative uterine cervical cancer: Japan Clinical Oncology Group study (JCOG1402)",2019,"Background: The purpose of this study was to assess compliance with treatment planning in a dummy-run for a multicenter clinical trial involving patients with high-risk postoperative uterine cervical cancer using intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) (JCOG1402 trial). Methods: For the dummy-run, we prepared a computed tomography dataset comprising two anonymized cases of post-hysterectomy cervical cancer. These were sent to the 47 participating institutions to assess institutional plan quality such as delineations and dose distributions. Results: Central review showed 3 and 4 deviations per treatment plan on average. The deviations related to the nodal and vaginal cuff clinical target volume (CTV) delineation, which accounted for approximately 50% of the total deviations. The CTV vaginal cuff showed considerable differences in delineation compared with the nodal CTV. For the Dice similarity coefficient, case 1 showed a mean ± 1σ of 0.81 ± 0.03 and 0.60 ± 0.09 for the nodal and the CTV vaginal cuff, respectively, while these were 0.81 ± 0.04 and 0.54 ± 0.14, respectively, for case two. Of the 47 institutions, 10 were required to resubmit their treatment plan because the delineations, planning target volume margin, and required dose distributions were not in accordance with the JCOG1402 protocol. Conclusions: The dummy-run test in postoperative uterine cervical cancer demonstrated substantial deviations in the delineations, particularly for the CTV vaginal cuff. The analysis data could provide helpful information on delineation and planning, allowing standardization of IMRT planning for postoperative uterine cervical cancer. ? 2019 The Author(s).","Article; clinical target volume; dose volume histogram; dummy run test; intensity modulated radiation therapy; Japan; pelvic girdle; protocol compliance; radiation dose distribution; treatment planning; uterine cervix cancer; vaginal vault prolapse; clinical trial; female; health care quality; human; hysterectomy; intensity modulated radiation therapy; multicenter study; organs at risk; postoperative period; prognosis; radiation response; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; uterine cervix tumor; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Organs at Risk; Postoperative Period; Prognosis; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms"
"Pneumonia-associated death in patients with dementia: A systematic review and meta-analysis",2019,"Background Pneumonia is a serious disease associated with mortality among patients with dementia. However, the reported frequency of pneumonia as a cause of death in patients with dementia varies, the reason for which has not been fully elucidated. Methods We conducted a systematic search in PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (inception to December 2016). Two authors independently determined the suitability of studies and potential bias and extracted the data. The primary outcome was frequency of pneumonia-associated death in patients with dementia. Stratified subgroup analysis was conducted among studies grouped according to type of mortality cause (immediate or underlying), information source of mortality cause (autopsy or death certificate), and study setting (clinic, hospital, or nursing home). Results We included 7 studies reporting the cause of death among patients with dementia and 12 studies comparing the cause of death among patients with and without dementia. The frequency of pneumonia-associated death among 19 eligible studies was 29.69% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.86–33.53). Those frequencies differed according to whether the source for information about cause of death was an autopsy confirmation (49.98%; 95% CI, 43.75–56.71) or death certificate (19.65%; 95% CI, 15.48–23.83) and according to whether the type of mortality cause was an indirect cause of death (13.96%; 95% CI, 9.42–18.51) or direct cause of death (44.45%; 95% CI, 29.81–50.10). The risk of pneumonia-associated death in patients with dementia was twice as high as among those without dementia (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.63–2.83; p < 0.001). Conclusion The various frequencies of pneumonia-associated death in patients with dementia were associated with the information source, type of mortality cause, and study setting. Patients with dementia in the terminal stages urgently require careful clinical management of pneumonia, to maximize patient life expectancy and quality. ? 2019 Manabe et al.

"Factors associated with a preference for disclosure of life expectancy information from physicians: a cross-sectional survey of cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy",2019,"Purpose: This study aimed to investigate experiences and preferences for disclosure of life expectancy, agreement between them, and the factors associated with preferences for disclosure of life expectancy with physicians among cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy. Methods: Cancer patients aged 20?years or older were consecutively sampled when they started radiation therapy at two university hospitals. Patients completed self-administered questionnaires concerning their experiences of and preferences for disclosure of life expectancy, treatment decision-making, psychological distress, physical symptoms, sociodemographic and medical factors, physician’s communication style, and provision of psychological, physical, and practical support. Results: Among the 226 respondents (response rate: 58%) who responded, 54% experienced disclosure of life expectancy, and 45% preferred it. The agreement is 65%. Eighty-five percent recognized their aim of radiation therapy as curative. A univariate analysis indicated that having a full/part-time job and wishing to leave treatment decisions to doctors were significantly associated with preference for disclosure of life expectancy, but psychological distress was not. A multiple regression analysis revealed that having a full-time/part-time job was significantly associated with preference of communication about life expectancy. Conclusions: Fifty-four percent of the patients experienced and 45% of the patients preferred disclosure of life expectancy. The agreement is moderate. Our results show that there was a significant association between employment status and patient’s preference for disclosure of life expectancy with physicians. Communication of prognosis is difficult but whether a patient continues to work or not may be an indicator of preference. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","adult; article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; controlled study; decision making; employment status; female; human; life expectancy; major clinical study; male; mental stress; multicenter study; multiple regression; parttime employment; prognosis; questionnaire; radiotherapy; univariate analysis; university hospital; young adult; aged; cross-sectional study; doctor patient relationship; interpersonal communication; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; patient preference; physician; prognosis; psychology; Adult; Aged; Communication; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Making; Disclosure; Female; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patient Preference; Physician-Patient Relations; Physicians; Prognosis; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult"
"Validation of the 21-gene test as a predictor of clinical response to neoadjuvant hormonal therapy for ER+, HER2-negative breast cancer: the TransNEOS study",2019,"Purpose: The Recurrence Score test is validated to predict benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. TransNEOS, a translational study of New Primary Endocrine-therapy Origination Study (NEOS), evaluated whether Recurrence Score results can predict clinical response to neoadjuvant letrozole. Methods: NEOS is a phase 3 clinical trial of hormonal therapy ± adjuvant chemotherapy for postmenopausal patients with ER+, HER2-negative, clinically node-negative breast cancer, after six months of neoadjuvant letrozole and breast surgery. TransNEOS patients had tumors ? 2?cm and archived core-biopsy samples taken before neoadjuvant letrozole and subsequently sent for Recurrence Score testing. The primary endpoint was to evaluate clinical (complete or partial) response to neoadjuvant letrozole for RS < 18 versus RS ? 31. Secondary endpoints included evaluation of clinical response and rate of breast-conserving surgery (BCS) by continuous Recurrence Score result, ESR1 and PGR single-gene scores, and ER gene-group score. Results: Of 295 TransNEOS patients (median age 63?years; median tumor size 25?mm; 66% grade 1), 53.2% had RS < 18, 28.5% had RS18–30, and 18.3% had RS ? 31. Clinical response rates were 54% (RS < 18), 42% (RS18–30), and 22% (RS ? 31). A higher proportion of patients with RS < 18 had clinical responses (p < 0.001 vs. RS ? 31). In multivariable analyses, continuous Recurrence Score result (p < 0.001), ESR1 score (p = 0.049), PGR score (p < 0.001), and ER gene-group score (p < 0.001) were associated with clinical response. Recurrence Score group was significantly associated with rate of BCS after neoadjuvant treatment (RS < 18 vs. RS ? 31, p = 0.010). Conclusion: The Recurrence Score test is validated to predict clinical response to neoadjuvant letrozole in postmenopausal patients with ER+, HER2-negative, clinically node-negative breast cancer. ? 2018, The Author(s).","estrogen receptor; estrogen receptor alpha; letrozole; progesterone receptor; antineoplastic agent; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; estrogen receptor; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; breast surgery; cancer hormone therapy; cancer surgery; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug response; ER gene; ESR1 gene; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; female; genetic screening; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; neoadjuvant chemotherapy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; partial mastectomy; PGR gene; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); postmenopause; predictive value; priority journal; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment duration; treatment response; tumor volume; validation study; breast tumor; clinical trial; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; mastectomy; metabolism; middle aged; neoadjuvant therapy; pathology; phase 3 clinical trial; procedures; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; validation study; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Letrozole; Mastectomy; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen; Treatment Outcome"
"Body Temperature, Heart Rate, and Short-Term Outcome of Cooled Infants",2019,"Therapeutic hypothermia following neonatal encephalopathy is neuroprotective. However, approximately one in two cooled infants still die or develop permanent neurological impairments. Further understanding of variables associated with the effectiveness of cooling is important to improve the therapeutic regimen. To identify clinical factors associated with short-term outcomes of cooled infants, clinical data of 509 cooled infants registered to the Baby Cooling Registry of Japan between 2012 and 2014 were evaluated. Independent variables of death during the initial hospitalization and survival discharge from the cooling hospital at ?28 days of life were assessed. Death was associated with higher Thompson scores at admission (p < 0.001); higher heart rates after 3-72 hours of cooling (p < 0.001); and higher body temperature after 24 hours of cooling (p = 0.002). Survival discharge was associated with higher 10 minutes Apgar scores (p < 0.001); higher blood pH and base excess (both p < 0.001); lower Thompson scores (at admission and after 24 hours of cooling; both p < 0.001); lower heart rates at initiating cooling (p = 0.003) and after 24 hours of cooling (p < 0.001) and lower average values after 3-72 hours of cooling (p < 0.001); higher body temperature at admission (p < 0.001); and lower body temperature after 24 hours and lower mean values after 3-72 hours of cooling (both p < 0.001). Survival discharge was best explained by higher blood pH (p < 0.05), higher body temperature at admission (p < 0.01), and lower body temperature and heart rate after 24 hours of cooling (p < 0.01 and <0.001, respectively). Lower heart rate, higher body temperature at admission, and lower body temperature during cooling were associated with favorable short-term outcomes. ?

"Evaluation of a biomarker for the diagnosis of pancreas cancer using an animal model",2019,"Many approaches have been taken to identify new biomarkers of pancreatic ductal carcinoma (PDC). Since animal models can be sampled under controlled conditions, better standardization is possible compared with heterogeneous human studies. Transgenic rats with conditional activation of oncogenic RAS in pancreatic tissue develop PDC that closely resembles the biological and histopathological features of human PDC. Using this model, we evaluated the usefulness of leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG-1) as a serum marker. In this study, we found that LRG-1 was overexpressed in rat PDC compared with normal pancreas tissue of the control rats. Serum levels of LRG-1 were also significantly higher in rats bearing PDC than in controls. Importantly, chronic pancreatitis in male Wistar Bonn/Kobori rats, which is a widely accepted as a model of chronic pancreatitis, did not cause serum levels of LRG-1 to become elevated. These results strongly support serum LRG-1 as a candidate biomarker for noninvasive diagnosis of PDC.

Methods: Stratified by recent-onset/chronic psychosis, 74 caregivers of outpatients aged 30.1 years (mean) were randomly assigned to receive TAU (treatment as usual) alone or TAU plus SM-FPE. All outcomes were measured at baseline, at the end of the intervention (10 weeks), and 1 month post-intervention (14 weeks). The primary outcome was the trait anxiety of caregivers at 14 weeks. Secondary outcomes included caregivers' state anxiety, psychological distress, care burden, and expressed emotion. Integrating these secondary outcomes, a conceptual framework of caregivers' health state was assessed via structural equation modelling. Results: Compared with TAU alone, SM-FPE plus TAU did not significantly improve all caregivers' individual outcomes. Direct effects of the intervention were observed in the caregivers of chronic patients as significant improvements of their overall mental health state at 10 weeks, which indirectly continued until 14 weeks. However, such intervention effects were not observed in the caregivers of recent-onset patients. Conclusions: The lack of effectiveness in the recent-onset stage suggests that the usefulness of the SM-FPE needs to be corroborated by further research. Trial registration: The study protocol was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT01731977; date of registration: 22 November 2012). ? 2019 The Author(s).",""
"Wavelet p-Leader Non Gaussian Multiscale Expansions for Heart Rate Variability Analysis in Congestive Heart Failure Patients",2019,"Objective: Numerous indices were devised for the statistical characterization of temporal dynamics of heart rate variability (HRV) with the aim to discriminate between healthy subjects and nonhealthy patients. Elaborating on the concepts of (multi)fractal and nonlinear analyses, the present contribution defines and studies formally novel non Gaussian multiscale representations. Methods: A methodological framework for non Gaussian multiscale representations constructed on wavelet p-leaders is developed, relying a priori neither on exact scale-free dynamics nor on predefined forms of departure from Gaussianity. Its versatility in quantifying the strength and nature of departure from Gaussian is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The ability of the representations to discriminate between healthy subjects and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients, and between survivors and nonsurvivor CHF patients, is assessed on a large cohort of 198 subjects. Results: The analysis leads to conclude that i) scale-free and multifractal dynamics are observed, both for healthy subjects and CHF patients, for time scales shorter than 170 s; ii) a circadian evolution of multifractal and non Gaussian properties of HRV is evidenced for healthy subjects, but not for CHF patients; iii) non Gaussian multiscale indices possess high discriminative abilities between survivor and nonsurvivor CHF patients, at specific time scales (? 20 s and ? 85 s). Conclusions: The non Gaussian multiscale representations provide evidence for the existence of short-term cascade-type multifractal mechanisms underlying HRV for both healthy and CHF subjects. A circadian evolution of this mechanism is only evidenced for the healthy group, suggesting an alteration of the sympathetic-parasympathetic balance for CHF patients. Significance: Results obtained for a large cohort of subjects suggest that the novel non Gaussian indices might robustly quantify crucial information for clinical risk stratification in CHF patients. ? 1964-2012 IEEE.","Cardiology; Dynamics; Formal concept analysis; Fractals; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Wavelet analysis; Congestive heart failures; Heart rate variability; Multi-scale; Non-Gaussian; Wavelet leader; Heart; adult; aged; Article; case control study; circadian rhythm; cohort analysis; conceptual framework; congestive heart failure; controlled study; discrete wavelet transform; dynamics; female; fractal analysis; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; human; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; male; non Gaussian multiscale; normal distribution; risk factor; statistical analysis; survivor; sympathetic tone; ambulatory electrocardiography; heart failure; heart rate; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; very elderly; wavelet analysis; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Female; Heart Failure; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Wavelet Analysis; Young Adult"

"A case of early-onset epileptic encephalopathy with a homozygous TBC1D24 variant caused by uniparental isodisomy",2019,"TBC1D24-related disorders are rare neurodevelopmental disorders that show a broad range of neuropsychiatric deficits and are mostly inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. Here we describe a case with early-onset epileptic encephalopathy, in whom exome sequencing detected a novel pathogenic homozygous c.442G>A, p.(Glu148Lys) variant in TBC1D24. She showed severe developmental delay, congenital sensorineural hearing loss and seizures, but the combination of a high dose phenobarbital and potassium bromide was very effective for the seizures. Sanger sequencing revealed that her mother was a heterozygous carrier of the TBC1D24 variant, but her father showed only wild-type alleles. Homozygosity mapping analysis using exome data showed loss of the heterozygosity region at 16p13.3–p13.13 encompassing TBC1D24. Genotyping analysis using rare variants within loss of the heterozygosity region indicated that the patient has a homozygous haplotype inherited from her mother, indicating maternal segmental uniparental isodisomy (UPiD). These data clearly show that exome sequencing is a powerful tool to perform comprehensive genetic analysis. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","carbamazepine; clobazam; levetiracetam; midazolam; phenobarbital; potassium bromide; zonisamide; apnea; Article; body weight; brain atrophy; brain disease; case report; child; clinical article; drug megadose; electroencephalogram; epilepsy; epileptic encephalopathy; female; gene; gene locus; genetic variability; genotype; head circumference; hearing impairment; homozygosity; hospital admission; human; hypsarrhythmia; infantile spasm; myoclonus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; polymerase chain reaction; prediction; preschool child; priority journal; quantitative analysis; seizure; TBC1D24 gene; tracheotomy; uniparental disomy; whole exome sequencing"
"Association between blood manganese level during pregnancy and birth size: The Japan environment and children's study (JECS)",2019,"Background: Manganese (Mn) is both an essential element and a potential toxicant. Although a few studies have suggested a nonlinear relationship between the maternal whole blood Mn level at delivery and infant birth weight, little is known about the effects of Mn levels during pregnancy on fetal growth, particularly with regard to sex-specific differences. Methods: In this nationwide birth cohort study, we examined the association of maternal blood Mn level during pregnancy with infant birth weight, length, and head circumference in 16,473 mother–infant pairs. Pregnant women living in 15 regions across Japan were recruited between January 2011 and March 2014. The analysis of birth size (8,484 males and 7,989 females) was conducted using a nonlinear spline, followed by the use of quadratic regression or linear regression models. The analysis of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (6,962 males and 6,528 females born vaginally) was conducted using multivariate logistic regression. Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted according to the timing of blood sampling. Results: The median maternal blood Mn level during pregnancy (i.e., 2nd and 3rd trimesters) was 16.2 ?g/L (range, 4.3–44.5 ?g/L). A positive linear association between the log blood Mn level and head circumference was observed in both male and female infants. However, a nonlinear relationship between the log blood Mn level and birth weight was observed only in male infants, such that the birth weight increased up to a blood Mn level of 18.6 ?g/L. In the subgroup analysis stratified by the timing of maternal blood sampling, this nonlinear relationship was obvious only when sampling was performed in the 3rd trimester. Male infants in the lowest blood Mn level quartile (? 13.2 ?g/L) faced an increased risk of SGA (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.35 [1.04–1.74]), as did those in the highest blood Mn level quartile (? 21.0 ?g/L) when sampling was performed during the 3rd trimester (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.62 [1.10 to 2.39]), compared to those in the third blood Mn level quartile (the category including 18.6 ?g/L). No association of blood Mn level with birth weight was observed among female infants, and blood Mn level was not associated with birth length in either male or female infants. Conclusion: A low blood Mn level during pregnancy or a high blood Mn level during the 3rd trimester was associated with a lower birth weight and increased risk of SGA in male infants, but not in female infants. A low blood Mn level was found to correlate slightly with a small head circumference among infants of both sexes. ? 2019 The Authors","hemoglobin; manganese; manganese; blood; cohort analysis; confidence interval; health impact; manganese; nonlinearity; pregnancy; regression analysis; risk; sex-related difference; womens health; adult; Article; birth size; birth weight; blood; blood sampling; body height; body mass; body weight gain; boy; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; first trimester pregnancy; girl; head circumference; hemoglobin blood level; human; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Japan; limit of detection; major clinical study; male; manganese blood level; maternal blood; obstetric delivery; parameters concerning the fetus, newborn and pregnancy; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal growth; priority journal; small for date infant; birth weight; drug effect; newborn; pregnancy; sex factor; small for date infant; third trimester pregnancy; Japan; Birth Weight; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Japan; Male; Manganese; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Sex Factors"
"Talc pleurodesis for secondary pneumothorax in elderly patients with persistent air leak",2019,"Background: We herein report the usefulness of two types of talc pleurodesis for secondary pneumothorax of elderly patients with persistent air leak who have severe pulmonary emphysema. Methods: We assessed 17 elderly patients with persistent air leak who received talc pleurodesis for secondary pneumothorax from April 2013 to March 2017. Thoracoscopic talc poudrage (TTP) (n=11) was performed in patients whose general condition was thought to sufficiently stable to tolerate for general anesthesia. Talc slurry pleurodesis (TSP) (n=6) via a chest tube was performed in patients whose general condition was thought to be insufficiently stable to tolerate general anesthesia. Results: The median drainage period after pleurodesis was 6 days in patients who received TTP and 12 days in patients who received TSP. Complications associated with talc pleurodesis included atrial fibrillation (n=1) in the thoracoscopic poudrage group, while the slurry pleurodesis group showed chest pain (n=2), asthmatic attack (n=1), and pneumonia (n=1). All patients who received thoracoscopic poudrage were able to leave the hospital after removal of the chest tube. Five of the six patients who received slurry pleurodesis were able to leave the hospital, but one of them died of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia (IP) on the 45th day after pleurodesis. The success rate was 94% (16/17). There were no cases of recurrence during the observation period. Conclusions: TTP was deemed likely to be safe and effective for patients able to tolerate general anesthesia. In patients with IP, especially those treated with steroids, the indication of talc pleurodesis should be cautiously considered. ? Journal of Thoracic Disease.

"Examination of diagnostic accuracy of UroVysion fluorescence in situ hybridization for bladder cancer in a single community of Japanese hospital patients",2019,"Objective: UroVysion (Abbott Molecular, Inc., Illinois, USA) is based on multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). It has been used successfully in the USA following its Food and Drug Administration approval in 2001. However, the technology was not approved for use in Japan until 2017. Cystoscopy and urine cytology are the most frequently used examinations to detect bladder cancer in Japan, and there are only a few reports regarding the performance of UroVysion. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the diagnostic accuracy of UroVysion FISH in Japanese patients whose tumors are detected by cystoscopy before transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Methods: From April 2018 to July 2018, a total of 40 patients who were diagnosed as having bladder tumors by cystoscopy, and therefore underwent TURBT were registered in this study. One day before TURBT, urine cytology and UroVysion FISH were used in order to compare the accuracy with which they could detect bladder carcinoma, as confirmed by pathological results of TURBT. Results: The pathological results of TURBT showed urothelial carcinoma in 33 cases. Urine cytology showed positive results for 0 cases (0%), suspicious results for 10 cases (30.3%), and negative results for 23 cases (69.7%). On the other hand, UroVysion FISH indicated 9 positive cases (27.3%) and 24 negative cases (72.7%). There were 19 cases of urothelial carcinoma (57.6%) that were not detected by either method. Conclusion: We conclude that UroVysion FISH alone is insufficient to detect bladder cancer and that cystoscopy is essential for the optimum detection or follow up of bladder cancer cases in our hospital. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.","adult; aged; bladder tumor; chemistry; cystoscopy; cytodiagnosis; cytology; diagnostic kit; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; follow up; human; male; middle aged; predictive value; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; urine; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cystoscopy; Cytodiagnosis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic; ROC Curve; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Urine"

"Combining hepatitis B core-related and surface antigens at end of nucleos(t)ide analogue treatment to predict off-therapy relapse risk",2019,"Background: There remains an unmet need for convenient biomarkers to assess the risks of discontinuing nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) in chronic hepatitis B (CHB). Aim: To investigate if hepatitis B core-related antigen (HBcrAg) is an independent of surface antigen (HBsAg) for risk prediction of NA cessation. Methods: This prospective multicentre study enrolled 135 CHB patients who stopped entecavir or tenofovir after achieving viral remission for a median of 25.2?months. All patients stopped NA with negative HBeAg and undetectable viral DNA, and were then observed for clinical relapse and HBsAg loss. Predictors including HBsAg and HBcrAg levels were explored using Cox proportional hazard model and weighted to develop a risk score. Results: During a median follow-up of 25.9?months, clinical relapse and HBsAg loss occurred in 66 and eight patients, respectively, with a 5-year cumulative incidence of 56.1% (95% CI 46.7-66.0%) and 8.8% (95% CI 4.3-17.4%), respectively. HBcrAg was an independent relapse predictor, as well as HBsAg, age, ALT and tenofovir use. A score (SCALE-B) was calculated by the equation of 35*HBsAg (log?IU/mL)?+?20*HBcrAg (log U/mL)?+?2*age (year)?+?ALT (U/L)?+?40 for tenofovir use. The concordance rates for clinical relapse were 0.87, 0.88, 0.87, 0.85 and 0.90 at 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5?years, respectively. Moreover, HBsAg loss occurred exclusively in low-risk patients predicted by the score. Conclusions: Serum HBcrAg and HBsAg levels were independent predictors of off-NA relapse and can be factored into a risk score to guide treatment cessation in patients with CHB. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alanine aminotransferase; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; nucleoside analog; tenofovir; virus DNA; antivirus agent; biological marker; entecavir; guanine; hepatitis B core antigen; hepatitis B surface antigen; adult; Article; chronic hepatitis B; drug use; female; follow up; human; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; prediction; priority journal; prospective study; relapse; remission; risk factor; blood; chronic hepatitis B; clinical trial; incidence; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; recurrent disease; treatment withdrawal; Adult; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers; DNA, Viral; Female; Guanine; Hepatitis B Core Antigens; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Tenofovir; Withholding Treatment"
"Systematic review and meta-analysis for 2017 clinical practice guidelines of the Japan research committee of the ministry of health, labour, and welfare for intractable vasculitis for the management of ANCA-associated vasculitis",2019,"Objectives: To provide evidence for the revision of clinical practice guideline (CPG) for the management of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) by the Japan Research Committee for Intractable Vasculitis. Methods: PubMed, CENTRAL, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society were searched for articles published between January 1994 and January 2015 to conduct systematic review (SR), and the quality of evidence was assessed with GRADE approach. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two non-RCTs were adopted for remission induction therapy, three RCTs and two non-RCTs for plasma exchange, and five RCTs and one non-RCT for remission maintenance therapy. A significant difference was found in efficacy and safety for the following comparisons. In the non-RCT adopted for remission induction therapy, glucocorticoid (GC) + cyclophosphamide (CY) was significantly superior to GC monotherapy regarding remission. GC + intravenous CY for remission induction therapy was superior to GC + oral CY regarding death at one year, serious adverse events, and serious infection. Concomitant use of plasma exchange for remission induction therapy of AAV with severe renal dysfunction reduced risk of end-stage renal disease versus non-users at month 3.

"Endometriosis and Recurrent Pregnancy Loss as New Risk Factors for Venous Thromboembolism during Pregnancy and Post-Partum: The JECS Birth Cohort",2019,"Background Since venous thromboembolism (VTE) is one of the causes of maternal mortality, several guidelines recommend prophylaxis using low molecular weight heparin for women in high-risk groups. The number of large population-based studies examining predictors for VTE has been limited, and there has been no study based on a Japanese population. Objective Our objective was to examine VTE risk factor during the pregnancy and post-partum period. Materials and Methods A nationwide birth cohort study known as the 'Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS)' was conducted by the Ministry of the Environment. The subjects consisted of 103,070 pregnancies recruited by the JECS between January 2011 and March 2014. Pregnant women completed the questionnaires during the first and second/third trimester. Their medical records were transcribed by physicians or research coordinators at registration, just after delivery and at 1 month after delivery. Results The frequency of VTE was 7.5 per 10,000 pregnancies (77 of 103,070) during the pregnancy and post-partum period. After the adjustment of multiple covariates for each factor, endometriosis and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) were identified as novel independent risk factors for VTE. Adjusted odds ratios were as follows: 2.70 (95% confidence interval, 1.21-6.00) for endometriosis and 6.13 (2.48-15.16) for RPL. Threatened abortion, threatened pre-term birth, pre-term birth and caesarean section were ascertained to be risk factors for VTE. Conclusion Careful attention should be given to novel predictors, such as endometriosis and a history of RPL, to prevent VTE during the pregnancy and post-partum period. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.","low molecular weight heparin; adult; Article; birth injury; body height; body mass; body weight; cesarean section; cohort analysis; ectopic pregnancy; embryo transfer; endometriosis; female; gynecologic disease; human; imminent abortion; in vitro fertilization; lifestyle; maternal mortality; medical history; metritis; multiple pregnancy; oligohydramnios; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy disorder; premature labor; priority journal; puerperium; pulmonary hypertension; questionnaire; recurrent abortion; risk factor; smoking; solutio placentae; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; venous thromboembolism; adverse event; complication; endometriosis; Japan; male; maternal age; newborn; prematurity; recurrent abortion; risk factor; venous thromboembolism; Abortion, Habitual; Abortion, Threatened; Adult; Cesarean Section; Cohort Studies; Endometriosis; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Male; Maternal Age; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular; Premature Birth; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Venous Thromboembolism"

"For making a declaration of countermeasures against the falling birth rate from the Japanese Society for Hygiene: summary of discussion in the working group on academic research strategy against an aging society with low birth rate",2019,"In 1952, the Japanese Society for Hygiene had once passed a resolution at its 22nd symposium on population control, recommending the suppression of population growth based on the idea of cultivating a healthier population in the area of eugenics. Over half a century has now passed since this recommendation; Japan is witnessing an aging of the population (it is estimated that over 65-year-olds made up 27.7% of the population in 2017) and a decline in the birth rate (total fertility rate 1.43 births per woman in 2017) at a rate that is unparalleled in the world; Japan is faced with a “super-aging” society with low birth rate. In 2017, the Society passed a resolution to encourage all scientists to engage in academic researches to address the issue of the declining birth rate that Japan is currently facing. In this commentary, the Society hereby declares that the entire text of the 1952 proposal is revoked and the ideas relating to eugenics is rejected. Since the Society has set up a working group on the issue in 2016, there have been three symposiums, and working group committee members began publishing a series of articles in the Society’s Japanese language journal. This commentary primarily provides an overview of the findings from the published articles, which will form the scientific basis for the Society’s declaration. The areas we covered here included the following: (1) improving the social and work environment to balance between the personal and professional life; (2) proactive education on reproductive health; (3) children’s health begins with nutritional management in women of reproductive age; (4) workplace environment and occupational health; (5) workplace measures to counter the declining birth rate; (6) research into the effect of environmental chemicals on sexual maturity, reproductive function, and the children of next generation; and (7) comprehensive research into the relationship among contemporary society, parental stress, and healthy child-rearing. Based on the seven topics, we will set out a declaration to address Japan’s aging society with low birth rate. ? 2019 The Author(s).","adult; aging; article; birth rate; child; child rearing; clinical article; education; environmental exposure; eugenics; female; human; human experiment; hygiene; Japan; language; maternal nutrition; maternal welfare; occupational health; parental stress; publishing; reproduction; reproductive health; scientist; sexual maturity; social work; socioeconomics; work environment; workplace; birth rate; child health; consensus development; environmental exposure; epidemiology; health care organization; health care planning; male; mental stress; methodology; organization and management; prevention and control; reproductive health; standards; trends; women's health; Aging; Birth Rate; Child; Child Health; Environmental Exposure; Female; Health Planning Guidelines; Humans; Japan; Male; Occupational Health; Reproductive Health; Research Design; Societies, Scientific; Stress, Psychological; Women's Health"

"In-depth interviews of non-hepatologists and the achievements made after introducing a “patient referral document for hepatitis” in our hospital",2019,"In 2017, we interviewed 23 non-hepatologists regarding chronic hepatitis B (CHB) using in-depth interviews. The rate of introducing patients to hepatologists was significantly higher among physicians (13/17, 76%) than that among surgeons (1/6, 17%, p = 0.036). Most non-hepatologists considered that the main reasons they did not introduce patients with CHB to hepatologists were a lack of time for preparing patient referral documents and ignorance regarding how introduce patients. They also highlighted that to improve the introduction rate, simplifying the patient referral document and creating an easy medical reservation system are required. Based on this research, in August 2017 we introduced the “patient referral document for hepatitis” in our hospital. Since then, the number of patients being introduced has increased by 1.6 times compared with the previous year. Based on the additional data, the construction of a more effective introduction system is recommended. ? 2019 The Japan Society of Hepatology.","Article; chronic hepatitis B; hepatitis; hepatologist; human; patient referral; physician; surgeon"
"Third epidemiological analysis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the central region of japan from 2006 to 2015",2019,"The present study aimed to clarify the incidence and clinical outcomes of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in the Chubu region of Japan from 2006 to 2015, compared with previous reports. A retrospective analysis was conducted based on medical records from 40 hospitals located in the Chubu region in the central Japanese main island, with a population of around 22.66 million individuals. This study was designed in line with to two previous clinical studies into NPC conducted in the same area of Japan. We recruited NPC patients diagnosed in hospitals across this area over a 10-year period (2006–2015) using a questionnaire about sex, age, primary site, clinical symptoms, pathology, Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging, serological exam, treatment, and survival. A total of 620 NPC patients were identified. The age-standardized incidence of NPC from 2006 to 2015 was 0.27 per 100,000 individuals per year. There were no significant differences between this study and the previous two studies conducted in the same area of Japan. The five-year overall survival rate for all patients was 75.9%, while those for patients with stages I, II, III, and IVA were 97%, 91%, 79%, and 68%, respectively. The age-standardized annual incidence of NPC in the present study was 0.27 per 100,000 individuals per year, which was relatively low and stable. The five-year overall survival rate for all NPC patients was significantly improved in this decade compared with previous studies. The smoking rates in male and female NPC patients were 64.5% and 18.8%, respectively, thereby suggesting the involvement of smoking in the incidence of NPC. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Accurate localization of rectal cancer using near infrared ray-guided surgery with intra-operative colonoscopy and da Vinci Firefly technology",2020,"Accurate localization of the tumor during robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer is crucial. Several techniques have been described, but each has its shortcomings. We developed a new technique of near infrared ray-guided surgery (NIRGS) to localize the tumor accurately, using intra-operative colonoscopy and da Vinci Firefly technology. After clamping the oral side of the tumor, the colonoscope was inserted. In the normal visible light mode, we could not recognize the endoscopic light; however, after changing to the Firefly mode, the endoscopic light was seen clearly. Using this simple and new technique, we could locate the tumor easily and accurately. We performed this technique in 12 patients and detected the location of the tumor clearly in all, without any procedure-related complications. Based on these findings, NIRGS is a useful and safe technique for detecting tumor location during robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. ? 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Indian ink; indocyanine green; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; colonoscopy; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; light; male; near infrared ray guided surgery; rectum cancer; surgical technique"
"The Effectiveness of Japan’s Community Centers in Facilitating Social Participation and Maintaining the Functional Capacity of Older People",2019,"This study examines the effectiveness of a community center in Japan at promoting social participation and sustaining its regular users’ functional capacity. The surveys were distributed to 108 physically and cognitively independent local older people; 72 responses were received. There were 16 regular users and 56 nonregular users. An inverse probability of treatment-weighted Poisson regression analysis was performed, and prevalence rate ratios were computed for social participation and functional capacity according to respondents’ use of the center. Results showed that using the center regularly facilitated social participation, contributing to the maintenance of living functions. Regular users’ social participation was promoted through opportunities in sports and volunteer organizations. Their living functions were maintained through instrumental self-maintenance and intellectual activity. Community centers evidently enable beneficial gatherings of older people, encourage social participation, and help to maintain higher level activities of daily living. Thus, they might offer effective preventative care for older people. ?

"Direct-acting antivirals in East Asian hepatitis C patients: real-world experience from the REAL-C Consortium",2019,"Background and aims: One-third of the global hepatitis C virus (HCV) burden is found in Asia. Real-world data from diverse East Asian cohorts remain limited. This study addressed the real-world status of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy among patients from East Asia. Methods: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients from clinical sites in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong were recruited in the REAL-C registry, an observational chart review registry. The primary outcome was sustained virologic response (SVR12, HCV RNA PCR &lt; 25?IU/mL 12?week post-therapy). Results: A total of 6287 CHC patients were enrolled. Compared to other East Asian patients, patients from Japan were older (66.3 vs. 61.5?years, p &lt; 0.0001), had lower body mass indices (22.9?kg/m2 vs. 24.6?kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001), and were more likely to have non-liver malignancy history (12.2% vs. 5.0%, p &lt; 0.001).The overall SVR12 rate was 96.4%, similar to patients both inside and outside Japan (96.6% vs. 96%, p = 0.21). The SVR12 rate ranged from 91.1 to 99.4% except treatment-experienced cirrhotic HCV genotype-1 patients who received daclatasvir/asunaprevir (85.9%) and the treatment-experienced cirrhotic HCV genotype-2 patients treated with sofosbuvir/ribavirin (87%). The overall rate of drug discontinuation was 1.9%, also similar across regions. On multivariate regression analyses, there was no significant association between geographic region and SVR outcomes. Conclusions: In this large multinational CHC cohort from the East Asia, oral DAAs were highly effective and well tolerated across the region. Policies should encourage treatment for all CHC patients with DAAs in Asia with its heavy burden of HCV. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.","asunaprevir; daclatasvir; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; antivirus agent; asunaprevir; daclatasvir; imidazole derivative; isoquinoline derivative; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; sulfonamide; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; body mass; chronic hepatitis C; controlled study; drug response; East Asian; female; genotype; geographic distribution; Hong Kong; human; Japan; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; medical history; observational study; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; South Korea; sustained virologic response; Taiwan; combination drug therapy; hepatitis C; middle aged; treatment outcome; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hepatitis C; Hong Kong; Humans; Imidazoles; Isoquinolines; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Ribavirin; Sofosbuvir; Sulfonamides; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome"
"Surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis: A systematic review",2019,"Study Design. A systematic review. Objective. To systemically review the previous literature regarding surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Summary of Background Data. The Lenke classification was published in 2001 as the classification of AIS. Since then, numerous articles have been published reporting the outcomes of surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 AIS. Methods. The electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were queried up to Aug 2018 for articles regarding surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 AIS. Surgical variables, radiographic assessments, and clinical outcomes of surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 AIS were summarized. Results. Fifty studies met the inclusion criteria. The average fused levels, % correction of thoracolumbar/lumbar curve at final follow-up, and % correction of thoracic curve at final follow-up for anterior and posterior procedures were reported to be 3.6–5.3 and 4.3–7.8 levels, 53–86 and 55–94% and 17–52 and 19–67%, respectively. Average coronal balance was imbalanced (20mm) at preoperation in 22/43 reporting study groups and balanced (<20mm) at final follow-up in all 37 reporting study groups. Scoliosis Research Society Version 22 scores showed no difference between anterior and posterior procedures in most of the reporting studies (5/6). Conclusion. Overall, the outcomes of surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 AIS are excellent. The thoracic curve was spontaneously corrected after surgery and coronal balance after surgery was better than before surgery. Both anterior and posterior procedures demonstrated satisfactory outcomes.

"Relationship between acceptance of workforce diversity and mental health condition among japanese nurses",2019,"Diversity management has been expected not only to progress productive nursing service, but also to promote well-being among Japanese nurses. However, Japanese conventional studies have not shown enough statistical evidences. Hence, this study examined the relationship between perception of workforce diversity and mental health condition among Japanese nurses. Through the internet research, we collected a total of 1,031 valid data (male = 217, female = 814). This study constructed eighteen original items to assess the acceptance levels of diversity elements; seniority, managerial position, clinical experience, employment history, academic background, generation, gender, nationality, role orientation, employment pattern, license, personality, health condition, family situation, work and life priorities, hometown, nursing ability and work motivation. Each diversity element was evaluated by four acceptance levels; (1) refusing diversity (Resistance), (2) ignoring diversity (Assimilation), (3) valuing diversity (Separation) and (4) utilizing diversity (Integration). Mental health condition was assessed by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, high-stress ≧6 point). As the results of a logistic regression analysis, higher acceptance of the managerial position, personality and work and life priorities were negatively related with high-stress. Higher acceptance of the employment pattern and work motivation were positively related with high-stress. These results indicated that diversity management was one of the effective approaches to improve mental health condition among Japanese working nurses. ?

"Bilateral giant retinal pigment epithelial tears in hypertensive choroidopathy",2019,"Purpose: To report a case of hypertensive choroidopathy with bilateral bullous serous retinal detachments (SRDs), retinal pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs), and giant retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) tears. Observations: A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus presented with bilateral visual loss of about 10 day's duration. He discontinued his oral medications for 2 months without the advice of a physician. At his first visit, the best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) were 0.02 in the right eye and 0.3 in the left eye (decimal notation), and the respective intraocular pressures were 15 and 13 mmHg. Bullous SRDs, large PEDs, and giant RPE tears were present bilaterally. Blot retinal hemorrhages and hard exudates were seen in the left eye. The systemic blood pressure was 231/77 mmHg, and bilateral lower leg edema was observed. Biochemical blood tests showed deteriorated renal function, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperglycemia. Ultra-wide-field fundus fluorescein angiography showed leakage at the areas of the SRDs and hyperfluorescent areas corresponding to the RPE tears bilaterally. Indocyanine green angiography showed hypofluorescent areas corresponding to the PEDs. Systemic computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed, and no malignancy was found. Based on these findings, hypertensive choroidopathy was diagnosed. A week after antihypertensive treatment, the SRDs and PEDs resolved bilaterally, and the BCVAs improved to 0.4 and 0.5 in the right and left eyes, respectively. The RPE tears remained in both eyes, although the SRDs and PEDs did not recur. Conclusions and importance: Hypertensive choroidopathy must be considered in the differential diagnosis of SRDs and/or PEDs. ? 2019","antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; creatinine; glucose; serum albumin; aged; albumin blood level; anterior eye segment; Article; B scan; best corrected visual acuity; bilateral bullous exudative retinal detachment; bilateral giant retinal pigment epithelial tear; case report; cataract; choroid disease; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; creatinine blood level; diabetes mellitus; disease duration; general condition; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hypertensive choroidopathy; hypoalbuminemia; indocyanine green angiography; intraocular hypertension; intraocular pressure; kidney function; leg edema; lower leg; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; optical coherence tomography; retina artery; retina detachment; retina fluorescein angiography; retina hemorrhage; retina tear; retinopathy; systemic therapy; visual disorder; wet macular degeneration"
"Associations of nutrient patterns with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome: Results from the baseline data of the Japan multi-institutional collaborative cohort study",2019,"The association between nutrient patterns and metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been examined in a Japanese population. A cross-sectional study was performed on 30,108 participants (aged 35-69 years) in the baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Dietary intake was assessed using a 46-item food frequency questionnaire. MetS was diagnosed according to the Joint Interim Statement Criteria of 2009, using body mass index instead of waist circumference. Factor analysis was applied to energy-adjusted intake of 21 nutrients, and three nutrient patterns were extracted: Factor 1 (fiber, potassium and vitamins pattern); Factor 2 (fats and fat-soluble vitamins pattern); and Factor 3 (saturated fatty acids, calcium and vitamin B2 pattern). In multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and other potential confounders, Factor 1 scores were associated with a significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) of MetS and all five components. Factor 2 scores were associated with significantly increased prevalence of MetS, obesity, and high blood pressure. Factor 3 scores were significantly associated with lower OR of MetS, high blood pressure, high serum triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol levels. Analysis of nutrient patterns may be useful to assess the overall quality of diet and its association with MetS. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Alcohol Consumption During Pregnancy and Risk of Placental Abnormality: The Japan Environment and Children’s Study",2019,"There have been no large nationwide birth cohort studies examining for the effects of maternal alcohol use during pregnancy on placental abnormality. This study searched for associations between alcohol consumption and the placental abnormalities of placenta previa, placental abruption, and placenta accreta using the fixed dataset of a large national birth cohort study commencing in 2011 that included 80,020 mothers with a singleton pregnancy. The presence of placental abnormalities and potential confounding factors were recorded, and multiple logistic regression analysis was employed to search for correlations between maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy and placental abnormalities. The overall rate of prenatal drinking until the second/third trimester was 2.7% (2,112). The prevalence of placenta previa, placental abruption, and placenta accreta was 0.58% (467), 0.43% (342), and 0.20% (160), respectively. After controlling for potential confounding factors, maternal alcohol use during pregnancy was significantly associated with the development of placenta accreta (OR 3.10, 95%CI 1.69-5.44). In conclusion, this large nationwide survey revealed an association between maternal drinking during pregnancy and placenta accreta, which may lead to excessive bleeding during delivery. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""

"Efficacy and safety of elbasvir/grazoprevir for Japanese patients with genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C complicated by chronic kidney disease, including those undergoing hemodialysis: A post hoc analysis of a multicenter study",2019,"Background and Aim: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of elbasvir/grazoprevir in genotype 1b chronic hepatitis C Japanese patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), including those undergoing hemodialysis. Methods: This post hoc analysis of a multicenter, retrospective study included patients who had received elbasvir/grazoprevir. CKD was defined by an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt;?60?mL/min/1.73?m 2 . The sustained virologic response (SVR) rate and frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events were assessed in patients with CKD. Results: The study population comprised 155 men and 182 women. The median eGFR level at baseline was 69.6?mL/min/1.73?m 2 (range, 3.0–128.5?mL/min/1.73?m 2 ). Among the 337 patients, 109 (32.3%) had CKD: 72, 14, and 23 (including 20 hemodialysis) had CKD stages 3, 4, and 5, respectively. The SVR rates according to the baseline CKD stages were 98.1% (51/52) in stage 1, 98.3% (173/176) in stage 2, 93.9% (46/49) in stage 3a, 100% (23/23) in stage 3b, 100% (14/14) in stage 4, and 100% (23/23) in stage 5. All 20 patients undergoing hemodialysis achieved SVR. There was no significant decrease from baseline in the median eGFR level throughout the treatment period among the patients with CKD.

"Reducing ADAMTS-3 inhibits amyloid β deposition in APP knock-in mouse",2019,"Reelin is a secreted protein that antagonizes the deposition and toxicity of amyloid β peptide (Aβ). Therefore, augmentation of Reelin activity may ameliorate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We have recently reported that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 3 (ADAMTS-3) cleaves and inactivates Reelin in the mouse brain. In the present study, we investigated the effect of reducing ADAMTS-3 on deposition of Aβ by crossbreeding drug-inducible ADAMTS-3 conditional knock-out (cKO) mice with “next-generation” AD model mice. We found that reducing ADAMTS-3 inhibited deposition of Aβ significantly in App NL - F mice, which produce human wild-type Aβ. On the other hand, reducing ADAMTS-3 had no effect in App NL -G-F mice, which produce the Arctic mutant Aβ (E22G) that forms protofibrils more efficiently than does wild-type Aβ. Thus, the findings suggest that the administration of an inhibitor against ADAMTS-3 will prevent the progression of AD pathology caused by deposition of wild-type Aβ. ? 2019 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan","ADAMTS 3 protein; ADAMTS protein; amyloid beta protein; reelin; unclassified drug; amyloid beta protein; amyloid precursor protein; APP protein, human; nerve cell adhesion molecule; nerve protein; reelin protein; scleroprotein; serine proteinase; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; female; gene knock-in; infant; male; mouse; nonhuman; pathogenesis; protein cleavage; protein degradation; protein deposition; Alzheimer disease; animal; disease model; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; knockout mouse; metabolism; transgenic mouse; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Animals; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Disease Models, Animal; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Serine Endopeptidases"
"Oral ixazomib maintenance following autologous stem cell transplantation (TOURMALINE-MM3): a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial",2019,"Background: Maintenance therapy following autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) can delay disease progression and prolong survival in patients with multiple myeloma. Ixazomib is ideally suited for maintenance therapy given its convenient once-weekly oral dosing and low toxicity profile. In this study, we aimed to determine the safety and efficacy of ixazomib as maintenance therapy following ASCT. Methods: The phase 3, double-blind, placebo-controlled TOURMALINE-MM3 study took place in 167 clinical or hospital sites in 30 countries in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and North and South America. Eligible participants were adults with a confirmed diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma according to International Myeloma Working Group criteria who had achieved at least a partial response after undergoing standard-of-care induction therapy followed by high-dose melphalan (200 mg/m 2 ) conditioning and single ASCT within 12 months of diagnosis. Patients were randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to oral ixazomib or matching placebo on days 1, 8, and 15 in 28-day cycles for 2 years following induction, high-dose therapy, and transplantation. The initial 3 mg dose was increased to 4 mg from cycle 5 if tolerated during cycles 1–4. Randomisation was stratified by induction regimen, pre-induction disease stage, and response post-transplantation. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) by intention-to-treat analysis. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one dose of ixazomib or placebo, according to treatment actually received. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02181413, and follow-up is ongoing. Findings: Between July 31, 2014, and March 14, 2016, 656 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive ixazomib maintenance therapy (n=395) or placebo (n=261). With a median follow-up of 31 months (IQR 27·3–35·7), we observed a 28% reduction in the risk of progression or death with ixazomib versus placebo (median PFS 26·5 months [95% CI 23·7–33·8] vs 21·3 months [18·0–24·7]; hazard ratio 0·72, 95% CI 0·58–0·89; p=0·0023). No increase in second malignancies was noted with ixazomib therapy (12 [3%] patients) compared with placebo (eight [3%] patients) at the time of this analysis. 108 (27%) of 394 patients in the ixazomib group and 51 (20%) of 259 patients in the placebo group experienced serious adverse events. During the treatment period, one patient died in the ixazomib group and none died in the placebo group. Interpretation: Ixazomib maintenance prolongs PFS and represents an additional option for post-transplant maintenance therapy in patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma.

"Constitutive activation of mTORC1 signaling induced by biallelic loss-of-function mutations in SZT2 underlies a discernible neurodevelopmental disease",2019,"There have been increasing number of reports of SZT2-related neurological diseases, the main symptoms of which are epilepsy, developmental delay, macrocephaly and a dysmorphic corpus callosum. SZT2 functions as a regulator of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cultured human cell lines and mouse tissues. However, it remains to be determined whether mutations in SZT2 in human patients alter mTORC1 signaling. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional consequence of biallelic SZT2 variants in Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from two patients with a typical SZT2-related neurodevelopmental disease. Increased phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 was identified in patient-derived cell lines under amino acid-starved condition, suggestive of constitutive hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling. This result was validated by constitutive lysosomal localization of mTOR in patients’ LCLs. Furthermore, patients’ LCLs display an excessive response to slight amino acid stimulation. Our data suggest the loss-of-function nature of SZT2 mutations in the patients, and consequent hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in response to both amino acid starvation and stimulation in their LCLs. By these functional analyses, the pathogenicity of newly identified SZT2 variants can be determined, allowing for more detailed characterization of genotype-phenotype correlations. ? 2019 Nakamura et al.

"TLL1 variant associated with development of hepatocellular carcinoma after eradication of hepatitis C virus by interferon-free therapy",2019,"Background: The aim of this study is to ascertain whether the TLL1 variant at rs17047200 is associated with the development of HCC after achieving sustained virological response (SVR) by interferon (IFN)-free therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Methods: A total of 1029 Japanese CHC patients with the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: (i) achieved SVR by IFN-free therapy, (ii) followed up at least 1?year from the end of treatment (EOT) (median 104?weeks), (iii) no history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 1?year from the EOT. Results: Nineteen patients developed HCC (HCC group) and 1010 did not (non-HCC group). The proportion of rs17047200 AT/TT was significantly higher in the HCC group than the non-HCC group (47.4% vs. 20.1%, P = 0.008). Multivariate analysis showed that higher levels of α-fetoprotein, FIB-4 and rs17047200 AT/TT were independent risk factors for developing HCC (HR = 3.22, P = 0.021 for α-fetoprotein > 4.6?ng/ml; HR = 3.89, P = 0.036 for FIB-4 > 2.67; HR = 2.80, P = 0.026 for rs17047200 AT/TT). Cumulative incidence of HCC was significantly higher in patients with rs17047200 AT/TT than in those with AA (P = 0.006). Comparing clinical characteristics according to the TLL1 genotypes, patients with rs17047200 AT/TT had significantly lower platelet counts and higher levels of FIB-4 than those with AA (P = 0.011 and 0.032, respectively). Conclusions: The TLL1 variant was independently associated with HCC development after HCV eradication by IFN-free regimen. It might be involved in hepatic fibrogenesis and thereby carcinogenesis. ? 2018, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.","albumin; alpha fetoprotein; aspartate aminotransferase; asunaprevir; daclatasvir; ledipasvir; sofosbuvir; adult; aged; albumin blood level; alpha fetoprotein blood level; Article; blood sampling; cancer epidemiology; carcinogenesis; chronic hepatitis C; clinical feature; controlled study; eradication therapy; female; fibrogenesis; follow up; gene; genetic association; genetic variability; genotype; Hepatitis C virus; human; Japanese (people); liver cell carcinoma; liver fibrosis; major clinical study; male; platelet count; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; tll1 gene; tumor biopsy; very elderly; viral clearance"
"Identification of the feeding arteries of hepatocellular carcinomas by performing dual arterial phase CT during pre-transarterial chemoembolization angiography",2019,"Purpose: This study evaluated the usefulness of performing dual arterial phase computed tomography (CT) during pre-transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) angiography for identifying the feeding arteries of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Materials and methods: Dual arterial phase CT was performed during pre-TACE angiography in 73 patients with 139 HCC. Ten HCC underwent this procedure twice, so the total number of examined HCC was 149. Early and late arterial phase images were obtained 6 seconds after injection of an iodinated contrast material serially during a single breath-hold. The feeding artery was defined as the branch of the hepatic artery that was connected to the enhanced areas of the tumor. For HCC that could not be visualized on the early arterial phase images, fusion images superimposing the early and late arterial phase images were constructed. Furthermore, technical success defined as successful catheterization of the subsegmental or more distal feeding artery was evaluated. Results: The feeding artery was correctly identified on dual arterial phase CT in 146 of the 149 tumors (98.0%). In two HCC, the feeding arteries could not be identified due to severe motion artifacts, and in one, due to the presence of anastomosis between the right and left hepatic arteries. Catheterization of the subsegmental feeding artery was successful in all TACE procedures (technical success rate: 100%). Conclusion: Performing dual arterial phase CT during angiography appears to be useful for identifying the feeding arteries of HCC. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","analgesic agent; epirubicin; gelatin; gelatin sponge; iodinated contrast medium; iodinated poppyseed oil; oypalomin; unclassified drug; abdominal pain; adult; aged; angiography; Article; cancer diagnosis; catheterization; chemoembolization; female; fever; hepatic artery; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; priority journal; retrospective study; spiral computer assisted tomography"
"Real-World Postmarketing Study of the Impact of Adalimumab Treatment on Work Productivity and Activity Impairment in Patients with Psoriatic Arthritis",2019,"Introduction: This study investigated the effectiveness of adalimumab treatment in improving Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) in patients with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in real-world settings in Japan. Methods: This 24-week, single-arm, postmarketing surveillance study (2014–2017), conducted at 75 centers in Japan, enrolled adalimumab-na?ve patients (paid workers, including part-time) meeting ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR). The primary endpoint was improvement in overall work impairment (OWI) scores from baseline to week 24. Secondary endpoints included changes in WPAI-PsA (OWI, absenteeism, presenteeism, and activity impairment), Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), psoriatic arthritis screening and evaluation (PASE) scores, Disease Activity Scores in 28 joints using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) scores, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) scores, and PASI75/90 and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 rates. Results: In the effectiveness population (n = 106; 72.6% men; mean ± standard deviation [SD] age, 49.3 ± 10.7?years), OWI scores significantly improved (mean ± SD change, ? 25.2 ± 35.3; p < 0.0001) from baseline to week 24. Other WPAI domain scores also improved significantly. Changes in OWI were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with PASE (r = 0.6284), DAS28(CRP) (r = 0.6059), BASDAI (r = 0.7281), and HAQ-DI (r = 0.6161) scores and were significantly influenced by previous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (p = 0.0142), and baseline PASE (p = 0.0098), DAS28(CRP) (p = 0.0026), HAQ-DI (p = 0.0004), and BASDAI (p < 0.0001) scores. At the last evaluation, rate (95% confidence interval) of PASI 75 and 90 (n = 100) was 58.0% (47.7–67.8) and 39.0% (29.4–49.3), respectively, and that of ACR 20, 50, and 70 (n = 58) was 86.2% (74.6–93.9), 70.7% (57.3–81.9), and 53.4% (39.9–66.7), respectively. No new safety signals were observed in the safety population (n = 148). Conclusion: Adalimumab treatment improved WPAI in patients with PsA. Improvements in OWI and joint symptoms were significantly associated. Trial Registration Number: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02414633.

"MafB is important for pancreatic -cell maintenance under a MafA-deficient condition",2019,"The pancreatic-islet-enriched transcription factors MafA and MafB have unique expression patterns in b cells in rodents. MafA is specifically expressed in b cells and is a key regulatory factor for maintaining adult b-cell function, whereas MafB plays an essential role in b-cell development during embryogenesis, and its expression in b cells gradually decreases and is restricted to α cells after birth in rodents. However, it was previously observed that MafB started to be reexpressed in insulin-positive (insulin) b cells in MafA-deficient adult mice. To elucidate how MafB functions in the adult b cell under MafA-deficient conditions, we generated MafA and MafB double-knockout (A0B0) mice in which MafB was specifically deleted from b cells. As a result, the A0B0 mice became more vulnerable to diabetes under a high-fat diet (HFD) treatment, with impaired islet formation and a decreased number of insulin b cells because of increased b-cell apoptosis, indicating MafB can take part in the maintenance of adult b cells under certain pathological conditions.
