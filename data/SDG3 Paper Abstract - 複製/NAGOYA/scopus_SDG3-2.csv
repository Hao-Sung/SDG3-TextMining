In Japan, nebulizer therapy for sinusitis has been covered by public health insurance since 1958 and has been commonly carried out nationwide. The Japan Society for Infection and Aerosol in Otorhinolaryngology and the Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Society of Japan set up a working group to draw up a consensus guidance on nebulizer therapy for acute rhinosinusitis. The device for nebulizer therapy are classified into jet, ultrasound, and mesh types. In Japan, cefmenoxime hydrochloride (CMX) was approved for use in nebulizer therapy since 1996. The widening of the obstructed lesions such as large polyps prior to nebulizer therapy were recommended. The numbers of times of nebulizer therapy is recommended for three times in a week for at least for 2 weeks (cure rate: 68%, eradication ratio: 48%). Concerns should be pay for the changes of activity of medicine due to the mixing and bacterial contamination. Pseudomonas cepacia growing in a short even in both saline and distilled water leads to contamination at high concentrations by 2 days. Nebulizer therapy is an effective treatment based on a drug delivery system (DDS) to the nasal and paranasal cavities. The therapy effectively increases the local drug concentration by promptly and uniformly delivering drugs to a targeted local site. The therapy is safe with less systemic absorption and with few adverse reactions. ? 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Acute rhinosinusitis; Guidance; Nebulizer therapy,alcohol; aminoglycoside antibiotic agent; cefmenoxime; cefuroxime; ciprofloxacin; corticosteroid; disinfectant agent; fosfomycin; levofloxacin; lincomycin; penicillin derivative; polypeptide antibiotic agent; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; tobramycin; vasoconstrictor agent; acute rhinosinusitis; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium contamination; Burkholderia cepacia; chronic rhinosinusitis; concentration (parameter); disinfection; drug activity; drug approval; drug contamination; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug stability; drug storage; equipment design; human; instrument sterilization; Japan; medical society; nebulization; nebulizer therapy; nose cavity; paranasal sinus; practice guideline; public health insurance; safety; treatment duration; treatment indication,2-s2.0-85071473067

Several techniques have been described, but each has its shortcomings. We developed a new technique of near infrared ray-guided surgery (NIRGS) to localize the tumor accurately, using intra-operative colonoscopy and da Vinci Firefly technology. After clamping the oral side of the tumor, the colonoscope was inserted. In the normal visible light mode, we could not recognize the endoscopic light; however, after changing to the Firefly mode, the endoscopic light was seen clearly. Using this simple and new technique, we could locate the tumor easily and accurately. We performed this technique in 12 patients and detected the location of the tumor clearly in all, without any procedure-related complications. Based on these findings, NIRGS is a useful and safe technique for detecting tumor location during robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery for rectal cancer. ? 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Near infrared ray; Rectal cancer; Tumor marking,Indian ink; indocyanine green; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; colonoscopy; female; human; laparoscopic surgery; light; male; near infrared ray guided surgery; rectum cancer; surgical technique,2-s2.0-85071317337

Recently, surgical treatment has been reported as superior to nonsurgical treatment, but the contribution discontinued antiresorptive agent use during MRONJ treatment remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of drug holidays and treatment strategies in MRONJ cases. Four-hundred and twenty-seven patients with MRONJ treated at nine hospitals from 2009 to 2017 were included in this multicenter retrospective study. Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the primary disease (osteoporosis or malignant tumor), diabetes, serum albumin, and treatment method (surgical or nonsurgical) were significantly correlated with the cure rate. The cumulative 1-year cure rates in the surgical and nonsurgical treatment groups were 64.7% and 18.2%, respectively. However, discontinuing antiresorptive agents did not influence the treatment outcome in the cohort overall, or in 230 patients after performing propensity score matching among the discontinuation and continuation groups. When stratifying by treatment method, antiresorptive agent discontinuation significantly increased the cure rate in patients with osteoporosis who underwent nonsurgical treatment. In patients with malignant tumors undergoing nonsurgical therapy, discontinuing the antiresorptive agent was associated with a better treatment outcome, but not with statistical significance. In contrast, drug holidays showed no effect on improving outcomes in patients with both osteoporosis and malignant tumors who underwent surgical therapy. Thus, regardless of the primary disease, discontinuing antiresorptive agents during treatment for MRONJ may not be necessary and may be helpful in some cases. Future prospective trials should examine this question further. ? 2019, The Japanese Society Bone and Mineral Research and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Discontinuing medication; Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws; Propensity score; Treatment outcome,agents affecting metabolism; albumin; bisphosphonic acid derivative; denosumab; aged; albumin blood level; Article; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; conservative treatment; diabetes mellitus; drug withdrawal; female; human; jaw osteonecrosis; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; osteoporosis; priority journal; retrospective study; treatment duration; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85070705567

Research on correlations between obesity/BMI and eosinophilic inflammation in asthma has yielded contradictory results, which could be partly ascribed to the absence of epidemiological data on the correlations. We aimed to elucidate the correlations between blood eosinophil count, its genetic backgrounds, and BMI in the general population. Methods: This community-based Nagahama study in Japan enrolled 9789 inhabitants. We conducted self-reporting questionnaires, lung function tests, and blood tests in the baseline and 5-year follow-up studies. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed in 4650 subjects at the baseline and in 4206 of these at the follow-up to determine single-nucleotide polymorphisms for elevated blood eosinophil counts. We assessed the correlations between BMI and eosinophil counts using a multifaceted approach, including the cluster analysis. Results: Eosinophil counts positively correlated with BMI, observed upon the interchange of an explanatory variable, except for subjects with the highest quartile of eosinophils (?200/μL), in whom BMI negatively correlated with eosinophil counts. GWAS and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) imputation identified rs4713354 variant (MDC1 on chromosome 6p21) for elevated eosinophil counts, independent of BMI and IgE. Rs4713354 was accumulated in a cluster characterized by elevated eosinophil counts (mean, 498 ± 178/μL) but normal BMI. Conclusions: Epidemiologically, there may be a positive association between blood eosinophil counts and BMI in general, but there was a negative correlation in the population with high eosinophil counts. Factors other than BMI, particularly genetic backgrounds, may contribute to elevated eosinophil counts in such populations. ? 2019 Japanese Society of Allergology",BMI; Cluster analysis; Eosinophil; Epidemiological study; Genome-wide association study,DNA; hemoglobin A1c; immunoglobulin E; low density lipoprotein; adult; aged; Article; asthma; body mass; cluster analysis; correlational study; eosinophil; eosinophil count; eosinophilia; female; follow up; gene frequency; gene identification; genetic background; genome-wide association study; human; Japan; lung function test; major clinical study; major histocompatibility complex; male; medical history; obesity; physical examination; population; principal component analysis; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism,2-s2.0-85068079801

We previously confirmed both the reliability and the validity of the Japanese version of the QOL-AD. However, the factor structure of this scale should be confirmed because the QOL-AD covers multiple facets of dementia patients’ lives. Thus, we performed a factor analysis of the Japanese QOL-AD. Then, we examined the correlations between each of the identified QOL factor scores and the results of other scales. Methods: The Japanese version of the QOL-AD was given to 132 AD patients and 132 caregivers. Four other tests were also performed at the same time: the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI), the Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale (HADL), and the Short Memory Questionnaire. A factor analysis using Varimax rotation was used to examine the dimensions underlying the QOL-AD. In addition, we examined the Pearson correlations between each of the identified QOL factor scores and the results of the other four tests. Results: Factor analyses of both versions of the Japanese QOL-AD (both the patients’ and the caregivers’ responses) revealed three factors that were named ‘psychological wellbeing’, ‘human relationships’, and ‘physical and social environment’. The ‘psychological wellbeing’ factor was significantly correlated with the Mood factor of the NPI. The ‘human relationships’ factor was significantly correlated with the Psychosis factor of the NPI. The ‘physical and social environment’ factor was significantly correlated with the HADL. Conclusions: Both the patients’ and the caregivers’ responses to the Japanese version of the QOL-AD were composed of three factors: ‘psychological wellbeing’, ‘human relationships’, and ‘physical and social environment’. The present results support the multi-domain concept of QOL proposed by Lawton. ? 2019 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society",Alzheimer disease; psychological wellbeing; QOL-AD; quality of life,aged; Alzheimer disease; Article; correlational study; female; human; human relation; Hyogo Activities of Daily Living Scale; Japanese (language); language; major clinical study; male; Mini Mental State Examination; mood; neuropsychiatric inventory; priority journal; psychological well-being; psychosis; Quality of Life in Alzheimer Disease Scale; questionnaire; rating scale; risk factor; Short Memory Questionnaire; social environment,2-s2.0-85064898039

The molecular mechanism of the antiproliferative effect of calcineurin inhibition, however, is poorly understood. We found that calcineurin inhibition delayed cell cycle progression at G1/S, and promoted cyclin D1 degradation by inhibiting dephosphorylation at T286. Importantly, overexpression of cyclin D1 partially rescued delayed G1/S progression, thereby revealing cyclin D1 as a key factor downstream of calcineurin inhibition. Cyclin D1 upregulation is observed in human invasive breast cancers, and our findings indicate that dysregulation of T286 phosphorylation could play a role in this phenomenon. We therefore propose that targeting site specific phosphorylation of cyclin D1 could be a potential strategy for clinical intervention of invasive breast cancer. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85071748659

We employed multiple logistic regression analysis to search for correlations between maternal exposure to house renovation or organic solvents and/or formaldehyde during pregnancy and such congenital abnormalities as congenital heart disease, cleft lip and/or palate, male genital abnormality, limb defect, and gastrointestinal obstruction. After controlling for potential confounding factors, we observed that house renovation was significantly associated with male genital abnormality (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.03-3.17, P = 0.04) when stratified by congenital abnormality, with no other remarkable relations to house renovation or occupational use of organic solvents and/or formaldehyde during pregnancy. There were also significant correlations for maternal BMI before pregnancy, history of ovulation induction through medication, maternal diabetes mellitus/gestational diabetes mellitus, and hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with an increased risk of congenital abnormality.

Therefore, we conducted this study to develop a biomarker for GC detection, consisting of urinary microRNAs (miRNAs). Methods: We matched 306 participants by age and sex [153 pairs consisting of patients with GC and healthy controls (HCs)], then randomly divided them across three groups: (1) the discovery cohort (4 pairs); (2) the training cohort (95 pairs); and (3) the validation cohort (54 pairs). Results: There were 22 urinary miRNAs with significantly aberrant expressions between the two groups in the discovery cohort. Upon multivariate analysis of the training cohort, urinary expression levels of miR-6807-5p and miR-6856-5p were significantly independent biomarkers for diagnosis of GC, in addition to Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) status.

In the validation cohort, urinary miR-6807-5p and miR-6856-5p showed significantly higher expression levels in the GC group, and the combination biomarker panel of miR-6807-5p, miR-6856-5p, and H. pylori status also showed excellent performance (AUC = 0.885). In addition, this biomarker panel could distinguish between HC and stage I GC patients with an AUC = 0.748. Urinary expression levels of miR-6807-5p and miR-6856-5p significantly decreased to undetectable level after curative resection of GC. Conclusions: This novel biomarker panel enables early and non-invasive detection of GC. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Biomarker; Gastric cancer; miR-6807-5p; miR-6856-5p; Urinary miRNA,biological marker; microRNA; adult; aged; area under the curve; Article; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer staging; controlled study; female; gastroenterology; Helicobacter pylori; human; human cell; major clinical study; male; mRNA expression level; priority journal; stomach cancer; urine level,2-s2.0-85068089047

Methods: Totals of 154 M. avium isolates and 35 Mycobacterium intracellulare isolates were obtained from treatment-na?ve patients with pulmonary MAC disease at the diagnosis of MAC infection at 8 hospitals in Japan. Their susceptibilities of moxifloxacin were determined by broth microdilution methods. Moxifloxacin-resistant isolates were examined for mutations of gyrA and gyrB. Variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) assay was performed using 15 M. avium VNTR loci and 16 M. intracellulare VNTR loci. Results: Moxifloxacin susceptibility was categorized as resistant and intermediate for 6.5% and 16.9%, respectively, of M. avium isolates and 8.6% and 17.1% of M. intracellulare isolates. Although the isolates of both species had amino acid substitutions of Thr 96 and Thr 522 at the sites corresponding to Ser 95 in the M. tuberculosis GyrA and Gly 520 in the M. tuberculosis GyrB, respectively, these substitutions were observed irrespective of susceptibility and did not confer resistance. The VNTR assays showed revealed three clusters among M. avium isolates and two clusters among M. intracellulare isolates. No significant differences in moxifloxacin resistance were observed among these clusters. Conclusions: Although resistance or intermediate resistance to moxifloxacin was observed in approximately one-fourth of M. avium and M. intracellulare isolates, this resistance was not associated with mutations in gyrA and gyrB or with VNTR genotypes. ? 2019 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases",gyrA; gyrB; Moxifloxacin; Mycobacterium avium complex; Variable numbers of tandem repeats,bacterial DNA; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) A; DNA topoisomerase (ATP hydrolysing) B; garenoxacin; levofloxacin; moxifloxacin; tosufloxacin; amino acid substitution; antibiotic sensitivity; antibiotic therapy; Article; bacterial mutation; bacterial pneumonia; bacterium isolate; bronchitis; broth dilution; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; DNA extraction; fluoroquinolone resistance; gene cluster; gene locus; gene mutation; genotype; human; minimum inhibitory concentration; Mycobacterium avium; Mycobacterium avium complex; Mycobacterium intracellulare; nonhuman; variable number of tandem repeat,2-s2.0-85067560258

Multiple myeloma accumulates APOBEC signature mutations as it progresses; however, the mechanisms underlying APOBEC signature acquisition and its consequences remain elusive. In this study, we examined the significance and clinical impact of APOBEC3B (A3B) activity in multiple myeloma. Among APOBECs, only highly expressed A3B was associated with poor prognosis in myeloma patients, independent of other known poor prognostic factors. Quantitative PCR revealed that CD138-positive primary myeloma cells and myeloma cell lines exhibited remarkably high A3B expression levels. Interestingly, lentiviral A3B knockdown prevented the generation of deletion and loss-of-function mutations in exogenous DNA, whereas in control cells, these mutations accumulated with time. A3B knockdown also decreased the basal levels of γ-H2AX foci, suggesting that A3B promotes constitutive DNA double-strand breaks in myeloma cells. Importantly, among control shRNA-transduced cells, we observed the generation of clones that harboured diverse mutations in exogenous genes and several endogenous genes frequently mutated in myeloma, including TP53. Taken together, the results suggest that A3B constitutively mutates the tumour genome beyond the protection of the DNA repair system, which may lead to clonal evolution and genomic instability in myeloma. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85065580975

Methods: Cancer patients aged 20?years or older were consecutively sampled when they started radiation therapy at two university hospitals. Patients completed self-administered questionnaires concerning their experiences of and preferences for disclosure of life expectancy, treatment decision-making, psychological distress, physical symptoms, sociodemographic and medical factors, physician’s communication style, and provision of psychological, physical, and practical support. Results: Among the 226 respondents (response rate: 58%) who responded, 54% experienced disclosure of life expectancy, and 45% preferred it. The agreement is 65%. Eighty-five percent recognized their aim of radiation therapy as curative. A univariate analysis indicated that having a full/part-time job and wishing to leave treatment decisions to doctors were significantly associated with preference for disclosure of life expectancy, but psychological distress was not. A multiple regression analysis revealed that having a full-time/part-time job was significantly associated with preference of communication about life expectancy. Conclusions: Fifty-four percent of the patients experienced and 45% of the patients preferred disclosure of life expectancy. The agreement is moderate. Our results show that there was a significant association between employment status and patient’s preference for disclosure of life expectancy with physicians.

However, intraoperative prediction of its occurrence and severity is difficult. In this prospective study, we evaluated the usefulness of intraoperative nerve monitoring (IONM) in predicting RLN palsy and its severity. Methods: Twenty patients who underwent subtotal esophagectomy with 3-field lymph node dissection were enrolled. Intraoperative electromyography (EMG) amplitudes of the vocal cords were measured by IONM at RLN and vagus nerve (VN) stimulation. Comparison was made between the vocal cords with RLN palsy and those without palsy and additionally between the vocal cords with transient RLN palsy and those with persistent palsy. Results: Among 40 vocal cords in 20 patients, 26 were intact and 14 were paralyzed. Seven had transient, six had permanent palsy. The mean EMG amplitude of intact vocal cords was significantly larger than that of paralyzed ones at VN (506 ± 498??V vs. 258 ± 226??V, p = 0.022) and RLN stimulation (642 ± 530??V vs. 400 ± 308??V, p = 0.038). The cut-off value for postoperative palsy were 419??V [positive predictive value (PPV): 48.0%, negative predictive value (NPV): 84.6%] at VN and 673??V (PPV: 44.8%, NPV: 90.9%) at RLN stimulation. The mean EMG amplitude of persistently paralyzed vocal cords tended to be small, compared with that of recovered ones at both VN (168 ± 173??V vs. 336 ± 266??V, p = 0.11) and RLN (244 ± 223??V vs. 536 ± 344??V, p = 0.051) stimulation. Conclusion: The absolute EMG amplitude of IONM might be helpful to predict the occurrence and severity of RLN palsy after esophageal surgery although the predictive value is low. ? 2019, The Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery.",Esophageal cancer; Intraoperative nerve monitor; Palsy; Recurrent laryngeal nerve; Vagus nerve,"antineoplastic agent; action potential amplitude; aged; Article; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; clinical trial; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; electromyography; esophagus cancer; esophagus resection; female; human; intraoperative monitoring; lymph node dissection; male; nerve; open surgery; postoperative complication; predictive value; preoperative chemotherapy; prospective study; recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy; sensitivity and specificity; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; vocal cord paralysis; adverse event; electromyography; esophagus resection; esophagus tumor; injury scale; intraoperative monitoring; peroperative complication; receiver operating characteristic; recurrent laryngeal nerve injury; vocal cord paralysis; Aged; Electromyography; Esophageal Neoplasms; Esophagectomy; Female; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Intraoperative Complications; Male; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Recurrent Laryngeal Nerve Injuries; ROC Curve; Vocal Cord Paralysis",2-s2.0-85063053457

However, undifferentiated hPSCs possess tumorigenic potential; thus, sensitive methods for the detection of residual undifferentiated hPSCs are essential for the clinical use of hPSC-derived CTPs. The detection limit of the methods currently available is 1/10 5 (0.001%, undifferentiated hPSCs/differentiated cells) or more, which could be insufficient for the detection of residual hPSCs when CTPs contain more than 1 × 10 5 cells. In this study, we developed a novel approach to overcome this challenge, using adenovirus and adeno-associated virus (AdV and AAV)-based selective cytotoxic vectors. We constructed AdV and AAV vectors that possess a suicide gene, iCaspase 9 (iCasp9), regulated by the CMV promoter, which is dormant in hPSCs, for the selective expression of iCasp9 in differentiated cells. As expected, AdV/CMV-iCasp9 and AAV/CMV-iCasp9 exhibited cytotoxicity in cardiomyocytes but not in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). The vectors also induced apoptosis in hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, and the surviving cells exhibited higher levels of hPSC marker expression. These results indicate that the AdV- and AAV-based cytotoxic vectors concentrate cells expressing the undifferentiated cell markers in hiPSC-derived products and are promising biological tools for verifying the quality of CTPs. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85062587201

Here we show that transient ER stress responses in the liver following feeding terminated by Sdf2l1 are essential for normal glucose and lipid homeostasis. Sdf2l1 regulates ERAD through interaction with a trafficking protein, TMED10. Suppression of Sdf2l1 expression in the liver results in insulin resistance and increases triglyceride content with sustained ER stress. In obese and diabetic mice, Sdf2l1 is downregulated due to decreased levels of nuclear XBP-1s, whereas restoration of Sdf2l1 expression ameliorates glucose intolerance and fatty liver with decreased ER stress. In diabetic patients, insufficient induction of Sdf2l1 correlates with progression of insulin resistance and steatohepatitis. Therefore, failure to build an ER stress response in the liver may be a causal factor in obesity-related diabetes and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, for which Sdf2l1 could serve as a therapeutic target and sensitive biomarker. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; hemoglobin A1c; luciferase; recombinant protein; Sdf2l1; streptozocin; thapsigargin; triacylglycerol; tunicamycin; unclassified drug; membrane protein; sdf2l1 protein, human; sdf2l1 protein, mouse; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; diet induced obesity; down regulation; endoplasmic reticulum stress; fungal cell culture; gene expression; gene overexpression; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; human; immunoblotting; immunoprecipitation; insulin resistance; lipid homeostasis; liver biopsy; liver histology; male; mass spectrometry; metabolism; mouse; nonalcoholic fatty liver; Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Activity Score; nonhuman; obesity; phosphorylation; plasmid; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; RNA interference; upregulation; Western blotting; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; C57BL mouse; diabetes mellitus; eating; experimental diabetes mellitus; gene knockdown; genetics; glucose intolerance; lipid metabolism; liver; middle aged; mouse mutant; nonalcoholic fatty liver; Animals; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Eating; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Glucose Intolerance; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Obese; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Obesity",2-s2.0-85062290562

The aim of this study was to validate real-world experience with 8-week G/P treatment in Japan. We conducted a prospective observational cohort study in 554 patients who underwent 8-week treatment from among 1,022 patients who initiated G/P therapy. The majority (54.5%) were male, with a median age of 66?years, and HCV genotype distribution was genotype 1, 43.8%; genotype 2, 55.3%; and mixed subtype, 0.9%. Overall, the sustained virologic response rate at 12?weeks (SVR12) was 92.8% (530/571) in the intention-to-treat population and 99.3% (526/530) in the per-protocol population. The SVR12 rates by subgroups were as follows: subtype 1a, 100% (6/6); 1b, 100% (189/189); 2a, 99.3% (150/151); 2b, 99.0% (103/104); and mixed subtype, 50% (2/4). Among four patients with virologic failure following 8-week treatment with G/P, none had baseline polymorphisms or treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in NS3. However, 2 of 4 patients with virologic failure had treatment-emergent amino acid substitutions in NS5A. Adverse events (AEs) were reported in 21.5% of patients and 1.2% of patients discontinued due to drug-related AEs. In conclusion, G/P treatment for 8?weeks was safe and effective for DAA-na?ve noncirrhotic genotype 1 or 2 patients in a real-world clinical setting in Japan. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",glecaprevir; hepatitis C virus; pibrentasvir; real world; sustained virologic response,glecaprevir plus pibrentasvir; aged; amino acid substitution; antiviral therapy; Article; cohort analysis; combination drug therapy; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; female; genetic polymorphism; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus genotype 1; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; human; Japan; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; sustained virologic response; unspecified side effect,2-s2.0-85070325533

The present study investigated possible associations between circulating cardiac troponin and metabolic syndrome or related factors. Subjects undergoing their annual health checkups were enrolled in the study (n = 1242). Laboratory measurements included serum high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and plasma B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Individual salt intake was estimated by calculating 24-h urinary sodium excretion from spot urine. Subjects whose electrocardiograms revealed ST-T segment abnormalities or who had renal insufficiency or a history of cardiovascular events were excluded. Subjects with metabolic syndrome had higher hs-cTnI levels than those without, but their BNP levels were equivalent. hs-cTnI levels were significantly associated with the presence and components of metabolic syndrome. Logistic regression analysis with the endpoint of hs-cTnI levels higher than the median value identified metabolic syndrome as an independent determinant of increased hs-cTnI levels. Additionally, urinary salt excretion levels were increased in subjects with metabolic syndrome or any of its components. Logistic regression analysis with the endpoint of metabolic syndrome revealed that hs-cTnI levels were independently associated with the presence of metabolic syndrome. A close association between hs-cTnI levels and the presence of metabolic syndrome, at least partially mediated by increased salt intake, was confirmed to exist in the general population. The findings support the idea that patients with metabolic syndrome develop asymptomatic myocardial damage without obvious ischaemic findings, which leads to increased cardiovascular risk. ? 2019, The Japanese Society of Hypertension.",Blood pressure; High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I; Metabolic syndrome; Myocardial damage; Urinary salt excretion,brain natriuretic peptide; creatinine; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; troponin I; adult; Article; blood sampling; body mass; cardiovascular risk; chemiluminescence immunoassay; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; electrocardiogram; female; glucose blood level; heart muscle injury; human; hypertension; insulin resistance; kidney failure; major clinical study; male; medical examination; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; obesity; physical activity; population research; salt intake; screening; sodium excretion; urinalysis; urine sampling; waist circumference,2-s2.0-85067863628

An extraperitoneal stoma tunnel is created laparoscopically as much as possible. Next, the peritoneum is separated from the inside of the abdominal cavity, and the extraperitoneal tunnel is opened. At the time of writing, we had performed laparoscopic extraperitoneal sigmoid colostomy in eight patients, without any complications or conversion to the conventional procedure.

A previously established RA model in D1CC transgenic mice aberrantly expressed major histocompatibility complex class II genes in joints, developing collagen II-induced polyarthritis and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies and interstitial pneumonitis, similar to those in humans. Molecular hydrogen (H2) is an efficient antioxidant that permeates cell membranes and alleviates the reactive oxygen species-induced injury implicated in RA pathogenesis. We used D1CC mice to analyse chronic lung fibrosis development and evaluate H2 treatment effects. We injected D1CC mice with type II collagen and supplied them with H2-rich or control water until analysis. Increased serum surfactant protein D values and lung densities images were observed 10?months after injection. Inflammation was patchy within the perilymphatic stromal area, with increased 8-hydroxy-2?-deoxyguanosine-positive cell numbers and tumour necrosis factor-α, BAX, transforming growth factor-β, interleukin-6 and soluble collagen levels in the lungs. Inflammatory and fibrotic changes developed diffusely within the perilymphatic stromal area, as observed in humans. H2 treatment decreased these effects in the lungs. Thus, this model is valuable for studying the effects of H2 treatment and chronic interstitial pneumonia pathophysiology in humans. H2 appears to protect against RA-ILD by alleviating oxidative stress. ? 2019 The Authors.

Methods: This is a retrospective study. A total of 242 children with OSA at the Department of Otolaryngology and the Good Sleep Center, Nagoya City University Hospital and the Toyohashi Mates Sleep Disorders Center were included in the study. All children underwent pre- and postsurgical polysomnography. OSA was defined as an apnea hypopnea index (AHI) 5 or greater. Pre- and postsurgical respiratory parameters were compared using paired T test. Results: Normalization of breathing after surgery for OSA children was 40% with AHI < 2 and 85% with AHI < 5. Japanese OSA children are not as obese as OSA children in many non-Asian countries. However, the normalization of breathing as a result of surgery in Japanese OSA children does not differ much from non-Asian countries. Conclusion: Japanese pediatric OSA that is not normalized by surgery may be affected by factors other than obesity. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Adenotonsillectomy; Children; Japanese; Normalization; Obesity; Sleep apnea,"adenotonsillectomy; apnea hypopnea index; apnea index; Article; body mass; breathing; central apnea index; child; disease association; female; human; Japan; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; mixed apnea index; obesity; obstructive apnea index; outcome assessment; oxygen desaturation index; oxygen saturation; polysomnography; postoperative period; preoperative period; REM sleep; respiratory tract parameters; retrospective study; risk factor; sleep disordered breathing; sleep parameters; slow wave sleep; stage 1 sleep; stage 2 sleep; total sleep time; adenoidectomy; adolescent; comorbidity; obesity; preschool child; sleep disordered breathing; tonsillectomy; treatment outcome; Adenoidectomy; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Obesity; Polysomnography; Retrospective Studies; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Tonsillectomy; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85061772931

He had been accompanying his wife, who was diagnosed with colon cancer 4 years previously, on hospital visits as the primary caregiver, but because of psychological issues, he was recommended to visit the psycho-oncology department's caregiver's clinic for a consultation. Detailed examination revealed that his appetite had been only about 50% of usual from about one year before, and he had lost 12 kg in weight in one year. The diagnosis of TD was supported by his abnormally low serum thiamine level.Significance of the results This report demonstrates that there is a possibility that care providers could develop TD from the burdens associated with caregiving. TD should be considered whenever there is a loss of appetite lasting for more than 2 weeks, and medical staff should pay careful attention to the physical condition of care providers to prevent complications resulting from TD.

Her tumor had been growing rapidly before the referral. Although she did not develop delirium, cerebellar signs, or eye symptoms, we suspected she might have developed TD because of her 2-month loss of appetite as the storage capacity of thiamine in the body is approximately 18 days. The diagnosis of TD was supported by abnormally low serum thiamine levels.Significance of results Cancer therapists need to be aware that thiamine deficiency may occur even before the start of cancer treatment.

From a pathological standpoint, EIF3D has been observed to be essential for cell growth in various cancer types, and cancer patients with high EIF3D mRNA levels exhibit poor prognosis, indicating involvement of EIF3D in oncogenesis. In this study, we found, by mass spectrometry, that Cullin-3 (CUL3)/KCTD10 ubiquitin (Ub) ligase forms a complex with EIF3D. We also demonstrated that EIF3D is K27-polyubiquitinated at the lysine 153 and 275 residues in a KCTD10-dependent manner in human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. Similar to other cancers, high expression of EIF3D significantly correlated with poor prognosis in hepatocellular carcinoma patients, and depletion of EIF3D drastically suppressed HepG2 cell proliferation. These results indicate that EIF3D is a novel substrate of CUL3/KCTD10 Ub ligase and suggest involvement of K27-polyubiquitinated EIF3D in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. ? 2019 The Authors",Cullin-3 (CUL3); EIF3D; Hepatocellular carcinoma; KCTD10,cullin; cullin 3; eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 subunit D; initiation factor 3; KCTD10 ubiquitin ligase; lysine; ubiquitin protein ligase; unclassified drug; Article; cancer prognosis; cell proliferation; complex formation; controlled study; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; mass spectrometry; mRNA expression level; priority journal; transcriptomics; ubiquitination,2-s2.0-85068390082

Methods: Stratified by recent-onset/chronic psychosis, 74 caregivers of outpatients aged 30.1 years (mean) were randomly assigned to receive TAU (treatment as usual) alone or TAU plus SM-FPE. All outcomes were measured at baseline, at the end of the intervention (10 weeks), and 1 month post-intervention (14 weeks). The primary outcome was the trait anxiety of caregivers at 14 weeks. Secondary outcomes included caregivers' state anxiety, psychological distress, care burden, and expressed emotion. Integrating these secondary outcomes, a conceptual framework of caregivers' health state was assessed via structural equation modelling. Results: Compared with TAU alone, SM-FPE plus TAU did not significantly improve all caregivers' individual outcomes. Direct effects of the intervention were observed in the caregivers of chronic patients as significant improvements of their overall mental health state at 10 weeks, which indirectly continued until 14 weeks. However, such intervention effects were not observed in the caregivers of recent-onset patients. Conclusions: The lack of effectiveness in the recent-onset stage suggests that the usefulness of the SM-FPE needs to be corroborated by further research. Trial registration: The study protocol was retrospectively registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (registration number: NCT01731977; date of registration: 22 November 2012). ? 2019 The Author(s).",Care burden; Family intervention; Multicentre study; Psychotic disorders; Young adulthood,,2-s2.0-85071751627

We conducted a hospital-based matched case-control study to investigate separately the preventive effects of PPSV23 and trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) on all-cause CAP and pneumococcal CAP in older individuals in Japan. Cases were individuals aged 65?years or older who were newly diagnosed with CAP from October 2010 to September 2014. Two control patients with a different disease (one respiratory medicine and one non-respiratory medicine) matched for sex, age, date of outpatient visit, and medical institution were selected for each case. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of PPSV23 and TIV for the occurrence of all-cause CAP and pneumococcal CAP were calculated using conditional and unconditional logistic regression models. The analysis included 161 cases and 308 controls from the 4-year period. The adjusted OR for the occurrence of all-cause CAP was 0.76 (95%CI?=?0.44–1.32) with PPSV23 vaccination and 0.79 (95%CI?=?0.50–1.25) with TIV vaccination compared with unvaccinated individuals. When the outcome index was restricted to pneumococcal CAP, the adjusted OR significantly decreased to 0.23 (95%CI?=?0.08–0.66) with PPSV23 vaccination, but not with TIV vaccination (adjusted OR?=?0.65, 95%CI?=?0.31–1.36). PPSV23 vaccination is likely effective in reducing incidence of pneumococcal CAP in older individuals, although its preventive effect for all-cause CAP has not been achieved. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

Real-world data from diverse East Asian cohorts remain limited. This study addressed the real-world status of direct-acting antiviral (DAA) therapy among patients from East Asia. Methods: Chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients from clinical sites in Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, and Hong Kong were recruited in the REAL-C registry, an observational chart review registry. The primary outcome was sustained virologic response (SVR12, HCV RNA PCR &lt; 25?IU/mL 12?week post-therapy). Results: A total of 6287 CHC patients were enrolled. Compared to other East Asian patients, patients from Japan were older (66.3 vs. 61.5?years, p &lt; 0.0001), had lower body mass indices (22.9?kg/m2 vs. 24.6?kg/m2, p &lt; 0.001), and were more likely to have non-liver malignancy history (12.2% vs. 5.0%, p &lt; 0.001).The overall SVR12 rate was 96.4%, similar to patients both inside and outside Japan (96.6% vs. 96%, p = 0.21). The SVR12 rate ranged from 91.1 to 99.4% except treatment-experienced cirrhotic HCV genotype-1 patients who received daclatasvir/asunaprevir (85.9%) and the treatment-experienced cirrhotic HCV genotype-2 patients treated with sofosbuvir/ribavirin (87%). The overall rate of drug discontinuation was 1.9%, also similar across regions. On multivariate regression analyses, there was no significant association between geographic region and SVR outcomes. Conclusions: In this large multinational CHC cohort from the East Asia, oral DAAs were highly effective and well tolerated across the region. Policies should encourage treatment for all CHC patients with DAAs in Asia with its heavy burden of HCV. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Association for the Study of the Liver.",CHC; DAA; Hong Kong; Japan; Korea; Taiwan,"asunaprevir; daclatasvir; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; antivirus agent; asunaprevir; daclatasvir; imidazole derivative; isoquinoline derivative; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; sulfonamide; adult; aged; antiviral therapy; Article; body mass; chronic hepatitis C; controlled study; drug response; East Asian; female; genotype; geographic distribution; Hong Kong; human; Japan; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; medical history; observational study; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; South Korea; sustained virologic response; Taiwan; combination drug therapy; hepatitis C; middle aged; treatment outcome; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Hepatitis C; Hong Kong; Humans; Imidazoles; Isoquinolines; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Republic of Korea; Ribavirin; Sofosbuvir; Sulfonamides; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85072021942

This study investigated the ability of telephone-delivered lifestyle intervention to reduce the incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in subjects diagnosed with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) during health checkups. Methods: Our subjects were participants in the Japan Diabetes Outcome Intervention Trial-1 (J-DOIT1), a prospective, cluster-randomized controlled trial designed to investigate whether goal-focused lifestyle coaching over the telephone can effectively reduce the incidence of type 2 diabetes development in high-risk individuals in a primary health care setting. We extracted 753 and 844 J-DOIT1 participants from the intervention and controls arms, respectively, who had IFG but did not meet the MetS criteria at baseline. The intervention arm received goal-focused lifestyle support delivered by health care providers via telephone over a 1-year period. The endpoint was the development of incident MetS, defined based on the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria modified for Japan. Results: During the median follow-up period of 4.9 years, 8.0% of the intervention arm and 12.0% of the control arm developed MetS. Overall, the hazard ratio (HR) for the development of MetS was 0.75 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.52-1.09; P = 0.14] in the intervention arm. However, the HR in overweight or obese [body mass index (BMI) ?23 kg/m2] individuals was significantly reduced to 0.63 (95% CI, 0.41-0.95; P = 0.029), but not in lean (BMI &lt;23 kg/m2) individuals. Conclusion: Telephone-delivered lifestyle intervention effectively reduced the incidence of MetS in overweight and obese subjects in a real-world setting.

MafA is specifically expressed in b cells and is a key regulatory factor for maintaining adult b-cell function, whereas MafB plays an essential role in b-cell development during embryogenesis, and its expression in b cells gradually decreases and is restricted to α cells after birth in rodents. However, it was previously observed that MafB started to be reexpressed in insulin-positive (insulin) b cells in MafA-deficient adult mice. To elucidate how MafB functions in the adult b cell under MafA-deficient conditions, we generated MafA and MafB double-knockout (A0B0) mice in which MafB was specifically deleted from b cells. As a result, the A0B0 mice became more vulnerable to diabetes under a high-fat diet (HFD) treatment, with impaired islet formation and a decreased number of insulin b cells because of increased b-cell apoptosis, indicating MafB can take part in the maintenance of adult b cells under certain pathological conditions.

Observations: A 68-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus presented with bilateral visual loss of about 10 day's duration. He discontinued his oral medications for 2 months without the advice of a physician. At his first visit, the best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs) were 0.02 in the right eye and 0.3 in the left eye (decimal notation), and the respective intraocular pressures were 15 and 13 mmHg. Bullous SRDs, large PEDs, and giant RPE tears were present bilaterally. Blot retinal hemorrhages and hard exudates were seen in the left eye. The systemic blood pressure was 231/77 mmHg, and bilateral lower leg edema was observed. Biochemical blood tests showed deteriorated renal function, hypoalbuminemia, and hyperglycemia. Ultra-wide-field fundus fluorescein angiography showed leakage at the areas of the SRDs and hyperfluorescent areas corresponding to the RPE tears bilaterally. Indocyanine green angiography showed hypofluorescent areas corresponding to the PEDs. Systemic computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging were performed, and no malignancy was found. Based on these findings, hypertensive choroidopathy was diagnosed. A week after antihypertensive treatment, the SRDs and PEDs resolved bilaterally, and the BCVAs improved to 0.4 and 0.5 in the right and left eyes, respectively. The RPE tears remained in both eyes, although the SRDs and PEDs did not recur. Conclusions and importance: Hypertensive choroidopathy must be considered in the differential diagnosis of SRDs and/or PEDs. ? 2019",Diabetic nephropathy; Fluorescein/indocyanine green fundus angiography; Hypertensive choroidopathy; Retinal pigment epithelial detachment,antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; creatinine; glucose; serum albumin; aged; albumin blood level; anterior eye segment; Article; B scan; best corrected visual acuity; bilateral bullous exudative retinal detachment; bilateral giant retinal pigment epithelial tear; case report; cataract; choroid disease; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; creatinine blood level; diabetes mellitus; disease duration; general condition; glucose blood level; glycemic control; human; hyperglycemia; hypertension; hypertensive choroidopathy; hypoalbuminemia; indocyanine green angiography; intraocular hypertension; intraocular pressure; kidney function; leg edema; lower leg; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; optical coherence tomography; retina artery; retina detachment; retina fluorescein angiography; retina hemorrhage; retina tear; retinopathy; systemic therapy; visual disorder; wet macular degeneration,2-s2.0-85069806247

To assess multiple exposure (mixture) effects and low prevalence health outcomes it is useful to pool data from several studies and conduct mega-data-analysis. To discuss a path towards data harmonization, representatives from several large-scale birth cohort studies and a biomonitoring programme formed a collaborative group, the Environment and Child Health International Birth Cohort Group (ECHIBCG). In this study, an intra-laboratory trial was performed to harmonize existing blood lead measurements within the groups' studies. Then, decentralized analyses were conducted in individual countries' laboratories to evaluate blood lead levels (BLL) in each study. The measurements of pooled BLL samples in French, German and three Japanese laboratories resulted in an overall mean blood lead concentration of 8.66 μg l?1 (95% confidence interval: 8.59–8.72 μg l?1) with 3.0% relative standard deviation. Except for China's samples, BLL from each study were comparable with mean concentrations below or close to 10 μg l?1. The decentralized multivariate analyses revealed that all models had coefficients of determination below 0.1. Determinants of BLL were current smoking, age &gt;35 years and overweight or obese status. The three variables were associated with an increase in BLL in each of the five studies, most strongly in France by almost 80% and the weakest effect being in Norway with only 15%; for Japan, with the far largest sample (~18,000), the difference was 36%. This study successfully demonstrated that the laboratory analytical methods were sufficiently similar to allow direct comparison of data and showed that it is possible to harmonize the epidemiological data for joint analysis. This exercise showed the challenges in decentralized data analyses and reinforces the need for data harmonization among studies. ? 2019 The Authors",Birth cohort; Child; Environment; Harmonization; HBM; Human biomonitoring; Lead; Lead (PubChem CID: 5352425); Pregnancy,,2-s2.0-85069436887

Some mRCC cases with favorable risk were reported to achieve complete remission and durable response using interferon alfa (IFNα) + low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2). Cytokine therapies may be suitable for some patients with mRCC as first-line therapy. The present study is a phase III, investigator-initiated, multicenter, prospective randomized controlled trial investigating patients with low and intermediate risk mRCC classified by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center risk criteria to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sequential treatment with cytokine (IFNα + IL-2) as first-line and axitinib as second-line therapy versus sequential treatment with sunitinib as first-line and axitinib as second-line therapy, which is the current standard treatment for patients with favorable risk. The target sample size was set at 72 patients per group (total 144 cases). The study duration is 7 years, and the duration for recruitment is 4 years. Our expectation of this trial is to clarify first- and second-line sequential treatment for mRCC better, especially in patients with favorable risk and some with intermediate risk. The results of this trial will certainly contribute to new information for the strategy of first- and second-line sequential treatment for mRCC.

In our proposed method, high-uptake regions in the breast and axilla were detected using db PET images and whole-body PET/CT images. In db PET images, high-uptake regions in the breast were detected using adaptive thresholding technique based on the noise characteristics. In whole-body PET/CT images, the region of the breast that includes the axilla was first extracted using CT images. Next, high-uptake regions in the extracted breast region were detected on the PET images. By integration of the results of the two types of PET images, a final candidate region was obtained. In the experiments, the accuracy of extracting the region of the breast and detection ability was evaluated using clinical data. As a result, all breast regions were extracted correctly. The sensitivity of detection was 0.765, and the number of false positive cases were 1.8, which was 30% better than those on whole-body PET/CT alone. These results suggested that the proposed method, combining the two types of PET images is effective for improving detection performance. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.",Breast cancer; Dedicated breast pet; Image processing; Whole-body PET/CT,"fluorodeoxyglucose; accuracy; analytic method; Article; automation; axilla; breast; clinical article; controlled study; dedicated breast positron emission tomography; diagnostic value; experimental study; false positive result; high uptake region; human; image processing; intermethod comparison; priority journal; radiological parameters; radiological procedures; sensitivity analysis; whole body CT; whole body PET; automation; breast; diagnostic imaging; metabolism; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; procedures; transport at the cellular level; whole body imaging; Automation; Biological Transport; Breast; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Positron Emission Tomography Computed Tomography; Whole Body Imaging",2-s2.0-85067683532

However, there has been little cost-effectiveness analysis of the treatments for it. Therefore, the purpose of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the pharmacological management of chronic low back pain. Methods: A total of 474 patients received pharmacological management for chronic low back pain using four leading drugs for 6 months at 28 institutions in Japan. Outcome measures, including EQ-5D, the Japanese Orthopaedic Association (JOA) score, the JOA back pain evaluation questionnaire (BPEQ), the Roland–Morris Disability Questionnaire, the Medical Outcomes Study SF-8, and the visual analog scale, were investigated at baseline and every one month thereafter. The incremental cost–utility ratio (ICUR) was calculated as drug cost over the quality-adjusted life years. An economic estimation was performed from the perspective of a public healthcare payer in Japan. Stratified analysis based on patient characteristics was also performed to explore the characteristics that affect cost-effectiveness. Results: The ICUR of pharmacological management for chronic low back pain was JPY 453,756. Stratified analysis based on patient characteristics suggested that the pharmacological treatments for patients with a history of spine surgery or cancer, low frequency of exercise, long disease period, low scores in lumbar spine dysfunction and gait disturbance of the JOA BPEQ, and low JOA score at baseline were not cost-effective. Conclusions: Pharmacological management for chronic low back pain is cost-effective from the reference willingness to pay. Further optimization based on patient characteristics is expected to contribute to the sustainable development of a universal insurance system in Japan. ? 2019 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association",,"celecoxib; loxoprofen; paracetamol; paracetamol plus tramadol; tramadol; analgesic agent; narcotic analgesic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; aged; Article; back pain evaluation questionnaire; clinical outcome; cost effectiveness analysis; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; female; follow up; health care cost; human; Japanese Orthopaedic Association score; low back pain; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observational study; pharmacological parameters; prospective study; quality adjusted life year; questionnaire; Roland Morris disability questionnaire; Short Form 8; spine cancer; spine surgery; very elderly; visual analog scale; chronic pain; clinical trial; cost benefit analysis; disability; economics; fee; low back pain; middle aged; pain measurement; quality of life; Aged; Analgesics, Non-Narcotic; Analgesics, Opioid; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Chronic Pain; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Disability Evaluation; Fees, Pharmaceutical; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85067460349

On the other hand, direct antiviral agents (DAAs) against hepatitis C virus (HCV) can achieve near-complete elimination of HCV infection. However, recent reports have claimed that DAAs pose a risk for HBV reactivation among patients with HBV and HCV co-infection. This suggests that an effective anti-viral strategy for both HBV and HCV would be extremely useful. We hypothesized that an activator of nuclear factor-erythroid factor 2 (Nrf2) could be a candidate, because heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a product of the Nrf2-target gene, was shown to be related to suppression of genome replication in both HBV and HCV. In this study, the potential of bardoxolone methyl (BARD), an Nrf2 activator, was examined in cell culture systems against HBV and HCV. We investigated that BARD had a suppressive effect on the production of extracellular HBV DNA in several HBV culture systems. In addition, BARD treatment reduced the levels of intracellular HBV pregenome RNA (pgRNA), a transcript from the HBV genome and a template of HBV genome replication. HCV genome replication was also suppressed in HCV subgenomic replicon-bearing cells by BARD treatment. BARD might be a novel treatment for patients with HBV and HCV co-infection. ? 2019",DAAs; HBV and HCV co-infection; Heme oxygenase-1; Nrf2 activator; nucleos(t)ide analogue drugs,bardoxolone methyl; circular DNA; daclatasvir; heme oxygenase 1; lactate dehydrogenase; telaprevir; transcription factor Nrf2; virus RNA; antiviral activity; Article; CC50 (cytotoxic concentration); cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; human; human cell; IC50; liver cell culture; mixed infection; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression level; virus genome; virus replication,2-s2.0-85067345435

Moreover, various phenotypes related to congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) or Bartter-like electrolyte abnormalities can be caused by HNF1B variants. In addition, 17q12 deletion syndrome presents with multi-system disorders, as well as RCAD. As HNF1B mutations are associated with different phenotypes and genotype–phenotype relationships remain unclear, here, we extensively studied these mutations in Japan. Methods: We performed genetic screening of RCAD, CAKUT, and Bartter-like syndrome cases. Heterozygous variants or whole-gene deletions in HNF1B were detected in 33 cases (19 and 14, respectively). All deletion cases were diagnosed as 17q12 deletion syndrome, confirmed by multiplex ligation probe amplification and/or array comparative genomic hybridization. A retrospective review of clinical data was also conducted. Results: Most cases had morphological abnormalities in the renal–urinary tract system. Diabetes developed in 12 cases (38.7%). Hyperuricemia and hypomagnesemia were associated with six (19.3%) and 13 cases (41.9%), respectively. Pancreatic malformations were detected in seven cases (22.6%). Ten patients (32.3%) had liver abnormalities. Estimated glomerular filtration rates were significantly lower in the patients with heterozygous variants compared to those in patients harboring the deletion (median 37.6 vs 58.8?ml/min/1.73 m2; p = 0.0091). Conclusion: We present the clinical characteristics of HNF1B-related disorders. To predict renal prognosis and complications, accurate genetic diagnosis is important. Genetic testing for HNF1B mutations should be considered for patients with renal malformations, especially when associated with other organ involvement. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Nephrology.",Diabetes; Gout; HNF1B; Hypomagnesaemia; Liver abnormality; Renal malformations,"genomic DNA; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta; hepatocyte nuclear factor 1beta; HNF1B protein, human; Article; chromosome 17q; chromosome deletion; clinical feature; comparative genomic hybridization; diabetes mellitus; estimated glomerular filtration rate; gene mutation; genetic screening; genotype phenotype correlation; heterozygote; human; hydronephrosis; hyperparathyroidism; hyperuricemia; hypomagnesemia; Japanese (people); kidney calcification; kidney cyst; kidney hypoplasia; kidney malformation; missense mutation; multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification; neurological complication; next generation sequencing; point mutation; prognosis; retrospective study; schizophrenia; urinary tract malformation; adolescent; adult; Bartter syndrome; central nervous system disease; child; chromosome 17; chromosome deletion; disease exacerbation; enamel; gene deletion; genetic predisposition; genetics; heredity; infant; Japan; kidney polycystic disease; male; middle aged; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pedigree; phenotype; preschool child; risk factor; urogenital tract malformation; vesicoureteral reflux; Adolescent; Adult; Bartter Syndrome; Central Nervous System Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 17; Comparative Genomic Hybridization; Dental Enamel; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Disease Progression; Gene Deletion; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 1-beta; Heredity; Humans; Infant; Japan; Kidney Diseases, Cystic; Male; Middle Aged; Multiplex Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pedigree; Phenotype; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Urogenital Abnormalities; Vesico-Ureteral Reflux",2-s2.0-85066232448

To examine these potential differences, we cultured the appendiceal luminal microbiota of patients with and without acute appendicitis, and identified the bacterial species therein. Methods: Fifty-seven patients with acute appendicitis and 37 patients without acute appendicitis who underwent curative resection of colorectal cancer and prophylactic appendectomies (control group) were included. Appendicitis patients were classified into the phlegmonous group or the gangrenous appendicitis group histopathologically. There was no patient with perforated appendicitis. Aerobic isolates were identified using standard identification schemata, and anaerobic isolates were identified according to the Japanese guidelines. Results: There were no significant differences among the three groups in the median number aerobe species present per patient. However, the median number anaerobe species in the gangrenous appendicitis group was significantly higher than that of the control group and the phlegmonous appendicitis group. In addition, the incidence of patients with Bacillus species, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bilophila wadsworthia increased as the disease progressed from phlegmonous to gangrenous appendicitis. Conclusion: The present results suggest that increased diversity of anaerobes and the translocation of Bacillus species, F. nucleatum, and B. wadsworthia are associated with the progression of acute appendicitis. ? 2019 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases",Acute appendicitis; Bilophila wadsworthia; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Microbiota,"antibiotic agent; acute appendicitis; adult; aerobic bacterium; aged; anaerobic bacterium; antibiotic therapy; appendectomy; appendix; Article; Bacillus; bacterium culture; Bacteroides fragilis; Bacteroides vulgatus; Bilophila wadsworthia; Citrobacter; Clostridium; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; disease exacerbation; Enterobacter; Enterococcus avium; Enterococcus faecalis; Enterococcus faecium; Escherichia coli; female; Fusobacterium mortiferum; Fusobacterium necrophorum; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Fusobacterium varium; gangrene; histopathology; human; Klebsiella oxytoca; Klebsiella pneumoniae; major clinical study; male; microflora; non-fermenting Gram-negative bacterium; nonhuman; Peptococcus; Peptostreptococcus; phlegmon; Porphyromonas; preoperative period; Prevotella; prophylactic surgical procedure; Proteus; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Streptococcus; Veillonella; acute disease; appendicitis; appendix; bacterial infection; Bilophila; isolation and purification; microbiology; microflora; middle aged; pathology; Acute Disease; Adult; Appendectomy; Appendicitis; Appendix; Bacillus; Bacteria, Aerobic; Bacteria, Anaerobic; Bacterial Infections; Bilophila; Female; Fusobacterium nucleatum; Humans; Male; Microbiota; Middle Aged",2-s2.0-85064176965

Since pharmacological activation of ATF4 exerts potent anti-tumor effects, modulators of ATF4 activation may have potential in cancer therapy. We herein attempted to identify small molecules that activate ATF4. A cell-based screening to monitor TRB3 promoter activation was performed using crude drugs used in traditional Japanese Kampo medicine. We found that an extract from Sophora flavescens roots exhibited potent TRB3 promoter activation. The activity-guided fractionation revealed that kurarinone was identified as the active ingredient. Intriguingly, ATF4 activation in response to kurarinone required PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK). Moreover, kurarinone induced the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21 as well as cytostasis in cancer cells. Importantly, the cytostatic effect of kurarinone was reduced by pharmacological inhibition of PERK. These results indicate that kurarinone triggers ATF4 activation through PERK and exerts cytostatic effects on cancer cells. Taken together, our results suggest that modulation of the PERK-ATF4 pathway with kurarinone has potential as a cancer treatment. ? 2019 by the authors.",ATF4; Cancer; ISR; Kurarinone; PERK; Sophora flavescens; TRB3,"activating transcription factor 4; ATF4 protein, human; cell cycle protein; EIF2AK3 protein, human; flavonoid; kurarinone; protein kinase R; protein serine threonine kinase; repressor protein; TRIB3 protein, human; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug screening; gene expression regulation; genetics; HEK293 cell line; HeLa cell line; human; metabolism; phosphorylation; promoter region; Sophora; tumor cell line; Activating Transcription Factor 4; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; eIF-2 Kinase; Flavonoids; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; HEK293 Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Phosphorylation; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Repressor Proteins; Sophora",2-s2.0-85071400094

EPCs serve as a model for pathophysiological and pharmacokinetic studies, which is important for drug discovery. However, primary human EPCs are phenotypically unstable, which limits their clinical utility. Therefore, we employed human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells to circumvent this problem. Here we focused on human iPS cell-derived sac-like structures (iPS-sacs), which contain endothelial lineage cells and hematopoietic lineage cells. Previous studies isolated only hematopoietic lineage cells from iPS-sacs. Therefore, here we attempted to isolate EPCs. However, iPS-sacs generated by a published protocol did not contain sufficient EPCs. Therefore, to generate iPS-sacs highly enriched in EPCs, we added the glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) inhibitor CHIR-99021 to the culture medium early during differentiation. The cells rapidly differentiated into mesoderm to yield abundant EPCs, and CHIR-99021 increased the proportion of EPCs contained in iPS-sacs. EPCs, which were purified using anti-platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM1) antibody-conjugated beads, expressed markers of immature endothelial cells. Purified EPCs formed tube-like structures and incorporated acetylated low density lipoprotein (Ac-LDL), reflecting endothelial phenotypes. The simple method described here will likely improve regenerative medicine and facilitate basic studies on the endothelial lineage. ? 2019",Differentiation; Endothelial progenitor cells; GSK3β inhibitor; Human induced pluripotent stem cells; iPS-sacs,"6 [[2 [[4 (2,4 dichlorophenyl) 5 (4 methyl 1h imidazol 2 yl) 2 pyrimidinyl]amino]ethyl]amino]nicotinonitrile; glycogen synthase kinase 3beta; platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1; Article; cell differentiation; cell isolation; cell lineage; cell maturation; cell structure; controlled study; embryo; endothelial progenitor cell; hematopoietic cell; human; human cell; induced pluripotent stem cell; mesoderm; phenotype; priority journal; protein acetylation; protein expression",2-s2.0-85066809281

This study was designed in line with to two previous clinical studies into NPC conducted in the same area of Japan. We recruited NPC patients diagnosed in hospitals across this area over a 10-year period (2006–2015) using a questionnaire about sex, age, primary site, clinical symptoms, pathology, Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) staging, serological exam, treatment, and survival. A total of 620 NPC patients were identified. The age-standardized incidence of NPC from 2006 to 2015 was 0.27 per 100,000 individuals per year. There were no significant differences between this study and the previous two studies conducted in the same area of Japan. The five-year overall survival rate for all patients was 75.9%, while those for patients with stages I, II, III, and IVA were 97%, 91%, 79%, and 68%, respectively. The age-standardized annual incidence of NPC in the present study was 0.27 per 100,000 individuals per year, which was relatively low and stable. The five-year overall survival rate for all NPC patients was significantly improved in this decade compared with previous studies. The smoking rates in male and female NPC patients were 64.5% and 18.8%, respectively, thereby suggesting the involvement of smoking in the incidence of NPC. ? 2019 by the authors.

Patients and Methods: Of 328 patients who underwent URS for upper urinary tract stones at our institution, 149 were randomly divided into a ureteric stent removal by string group (string group) and a ureteric stent removal by flexible cystoscope group (cystoscope group), using gender as a stratification factor. We focused on four sites, namely, the upper abdomen, bladder, flank and urethra, to evaluate the most painful site at stent removal. The primary endpoint was total pain scores for four sites at stent removal in the string group vs the cystoscope group. Secondary endpoints included comparison of the psychological well-being scores of patients using the five-item World Health Organization well-being index (WHO-5) preoperatively, pre-stent removal and 2 weeks after stent removal between the string group and cystoscope group. Results: Of 149 patients analysed, 74 were in the string group and 75 were in the cystoscope group. In most patients, the ureteric stent was removed ~10 days after URS. The string group experienced significantly less pain than the cystoscope group (mean visual analogue scale [VAS] scores 2.73 vs 5.67; P < 0.001). Although VAS scores for women were not significantly different between the groups (P = 0.300), those for men were significantly lower in the string group (P < 0.001). In particular, men in the string group experienced significantly less urethral pain than those in the cystoscope group. The WHO-5 scores were not significantly different between the groups preoperatively, pre-stent removal or 2 weeks after stent removal. Stent string-related complications and self-rated symptoms were also not significantly different. Conclusion: Ureteric stent removal by string after URS led to significantly less pain than removal by cystoscope in men. Patients in the string group experienced no more complications in terms of urinary tract infections or accidental dislodgement than those in the cytoscope group. ? 2018 The Authors BJU International ? 2018 BJU International Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd",complications; stent string removal; ureteroscopy,abdomen; adult; Article; clinical evaluation; clinical feature; controlled study; cystalgia; device removal; female; flank pain; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; pain assessment; preoperative care; priority journal; psychological well-being; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; self evaluation; sex difference; ureteral stenting; ureteroscopy; urethra discomfort; urethra disease; urethral pain; urinary tract infection; urolithiasis; visual analog scale; World Health Organization,2-s2.0-85058709721

However, the implications of these comorbidities for cochlear implant placement have been not fully established. This study sought to identify these implications by comparing developmental delays among children with these conditions. Methods: Participants were children who were followed up at least every 6 months for 24 months after cochlear implant surgery. Developmental delays were assessed using the Enjoji Scale of Infant Analytical Development (Enjoji Scale) and compared in three groups with hearing loss: those with ID (ID group, n = 4); those with ASD and ID (ASD + ID group, n = 4); and those with typical development (control group, n = 5). Developmental delay was evaluated longitudinally before and after cochlear implant placement for 18 months. Results: Among the six subscales that make up the Enjoji Scale, language development and intelligence development were significantly delayed in all three groups and were exacerbated over time except for language development in the control group. Emotional development and social behavior were significantly delayed only in the ASD + ID group. Comparison of intergroup differences revealed delays in language development in the ID and ASD + ID groups compared with the control group. Conclusion: The Enjoji Scale successfully demonstrated developmental delays characteristic to the underlying comorbidities of ID with or without ASD in children with cochlear implants. The Enjoji Scale can be a useful diagnostic tool for screening children with cochlear implants for ID with or without ASD. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Autism spectrum disorder; Cochlear implant; Enjoji Scale; Intellectual disability,"Article; autism; child; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; comparative study; controlled study; developmental delay; disease association; disease exacerbation; emotionality; Enjoji Scale of Infant Analytical Development; female; follow up; hearing impairment; human; intellectual impairment; language development; major clinical study; male; mental development assessment; outcome assessment; pediatrics; preschool child; retrospective study; screening test; social behavior; autism; case control study; cochlea prosthesis; cochlear implantation; comorbidity; developmental disorder; hearing impairment; infant; intellectual impairment; longitudinal study; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Cochlear Implantation; Cochlear Implants; Comorbidity; Developmental Disabilities; Female; Hearing Loss; Humans; Infant; Intellectual Disability; Language Development; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Social Behavior",2-s2.0-85058654141

To our knowledge, this is the first report to describe SNEC found during the treatment of sinonasal IP. Surgery and five cycles of cisplatin plus etoposide with concurrent intensity modulated radiation therapy were performed. Neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis was noted during 6 years of post-diagnostic follow-up. The prognosis of SNEC is very poor. Treatment planning for sinonasal IP should consider a possible association with this rare but aggressive malignancy, whose treatment is completely different from that of squamous cell carcinoma, a malignancy which is commonly associated with IP. We also performed a PubMed review of the literature to identify the incidence and pathological diagnosis of associated malignancy. Among a total of 5286 cases of sinonasal IP (61 studies), the incidence of associated malignancy was 8.02% in squamous cell carcinoma, 0.19% in transitional cell carcinoma, 0.04% in mucoepidermoid carcinoma, 0.02% in verrucous cell carcinoma and 0.02% in adenocarcinoma. The incidence of associated malignancy was significantly higher in East and Southeast Asia (11.0%) and North America (10.4%) than in Europe (3.9%) (p = 0.04 and p = 0.03, respectively; T-test). ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Incidence of malignancy; Sinonasal inverted papilloma; Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma,"cisplatin; etoposide; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; etoposide; adenocarcinoma; aged; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer incidence; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; carcinoma; disease association; Europe; female; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; inverted papilloma; major clinical study; mucoepidermoid tumor; multiple cycle treatment; neuroendocrine carcinoma; North America; rare disease; sinonasal inverted papilloma; small cell carcinoma; Southeast Asia; squamous cell carcinoma; transitional cell carcinoma; verrucous cell carcinoma; carcinoma; case report; complication; diagnostic imaging; ear nose throat surgery; inverted papilloma; maxilla sinus cancer; nose obstruction; nose polyp; nose tumor; pathology; small cell carcinoma; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; Carcinoma, Small Cell; Cisplatin; Etoposide; Female; Humans; Maxillary Sinus Neoplasms; Nasal Obstruction; Nasal Polyps; Nose Neoplasms; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Papilloma, Inverted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated",2-s2.0-85057986217

Methods: For the dummy-run, we prepared a computed tomography dataset comprising two anonymized cases of post-hysterectomy cervical cancer. These were sent to the 47 participating institutions to assess institutional plan quality such as delineations and dose distributions. Results: Central review showed 3 and 4 deviations per treatment plan on average. The deviations related to the nodal and vaginal cuff clinical target volume (CTV) delineation, which accounted for approximately 50% of the total deviations. The CTV vaginal cuff showed considerable differences in delineation compared with the nodal CTV. For the Dice similarity coefficient, case 1 showed a mean ± 1σ of 0.81 ± 0.03 and 0.60 ± 0.09 for the nodal and the CTV vaginal cuff, respectively, while these were 0.81 ± 0.04 and 0.54 ± 0.14, respectively, for case two. Of the 47 institutions, 10 were required to resubmit their treatment plan because the delineations, planning target volume margin, and required dose distributions were not in accordance with the JCOG1402 protocol. Conclusions: The dummy-run test in postoperative uterine cervical cancer demonstrated substantial deviations in the delineations, particularly for the CTV vaginal cuff. The analysis data could provide helpful information on delineation and planning, allowing standardization of IMRT planning for postoperative uterine cervical cancer. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cervical cancer; Dummy-run; IMRT; VMAT,"Article; clinical target volume; dose volume histogram; dummy run test; intensity modulated radiation therapy; Japan; pelvic girdle; protocol compliance; radiation dose distribution; treatment planning; uterine cervix cancer; vaginal vault prolapse; clinical trial; female; health care quality; human; hysterectomy; intensity modulated radiation therapy; multicenter study; organs at risk; postoperative period; prognosis; radiation response; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; uterine cervix tumor; Female; Humans; Hysterectomy; Organs at Risk; Postoperative Period; Prognosis; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85070096527

Methods: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 56 consecutive colorectal cancer patients who underwent right hemicolectomy prospectively. Twenty patients underwent SILS, and 36 underwent MLS. The preoperative and postoperative levels of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-reactive protein (CRP) as well as the number of platelet cells were measured in all patients. The operation duration, number of harvested lymph nodes, length of the resected bowel, blood loss, and duration of hospital stay were also compared between the two groups. Results: Neither SILS nor MLS had any conversion cases. The operation duration was longer for MLS than for SILS. Blood loss tended to be lower among patients who underwent SILS than among those who underwent MLS. However, the number of harvested LNs was significantly lower with SILS than with MLS. In both pre- and postoperative blood examinations, there was no marked difference in inflammatory mediators between MLS and SILS. Conclusion: There was no systemic inflammatory advantage associated with SILS compared with MLS. ? 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",IL-6; Right hemicolectomy; SILS; Systemic inflammation,"C reactive protein; interleukin 6; vasculotropin; biological marker; C reactive protein; interleukin 6; vasculotropin A; aged; Article; cancer patient; colorectal cancer; comparative study; controlled study; female; hemicolectomy; hospitalization; human; laparoscopic surgery; lymph node; major clinical study; male; multi port laparoscopic surgery; operation duration; platelet count; postoperative complication; postoperative inflammation; protein blood level; retrospective study; single incision laparoscopic surgery; thrombocyte; blood; colon resection; feasibility study; laparoscopy; length of stay; operative blood loss; postoperative complication; procedures; systemic inflammatory response syndrome; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Blood Loss, Surgical; C-Reactive Protein; Colectomy; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Platelet Count; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome; Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor A",2-s2.0-85061334863

This study aimed to elucidate genetic variants associated with these conditions using a genome-wide approach. Data from four sites of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study were used in the discovery phase (Stage I); two datasets from the Hospital-based Epidemiologic Research Program at Aichi Cancer Center 2 (HERPACC2) study were used in the replication phases (Stages II and III) and SKAT (SNP-set Kernel Association Test) and single variant-based GWASs were conducted for the risks of gastric atrophy (GA) and severe GA defined by serum pepsinogen (PG) levels, and PG1 and PG1/2 ratios. In the gene-based SKAT in Stage I, prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA) was significantly associated with the risks of GA and severe GA, and serum PG1/2 level by linear kernel [false discovery rate (FDR) = 0.011, 0.230 and 7.2 × 10-7, respectively]. The single variant-based GWAS revealed that nine PSCA single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) fulfilled the genome-wide significance level (P &lt; 5 × 10-8) for the risks of both GA and severe GA in the combined study, although most of these associations did not reach genome-wide significance in the discovery or validation cohort on their own. GWAS for serum PG1 levels and PG1/2 ratios revealed that the PSCA rs2920283 SNP had a striking P-value of 4.31 × 10-27 for PG1/2 ratios. The present GWAS revealed the genetic locus of PSCA as the most significant locus for the risk of HP-induced GA, which confirmed the recently reported association in Europeans. ? 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Design: Post hoc analyses of 2 phase 3, randomized, double-masked, multicenter, sham-controlled studies. Participants: Three hundred sixty-six patients with macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion randomized in COPERNICUS and GALILEO. Methods: We randomized patients 3:2 to receive intravitreal aflibercept 2 mg every 4 weeks or sham injections until W24. RNP and MNP were assessed by a masked independent reading center. Main Outcome Measures: Proportion of patients with 10 disc areas (DA) or more of RNP and any degree of MNP at W24, relative risks of 10 DA or more of RNP or any degree of MNP at W24 developing, change from baseline in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) by baseline RNP and MNP status, and relationship between baseline RNP and MNP status. Results: At baseline, 24.6% of patients showed 10 DA or more of RNP and 72.6% showed MNP, regardless of baseline RNP status. At W24, the pooled proportions of patients in the intravitreal aflibercept and sham groups with 10 DA or more of RNP were 11.6% and 29.0%, respectively (P = 0.0001); the respective proportions with any degree of MNP were 61.2% and 79.5% (P = 0.0008). Relative risks and 95% confidence intervals for intravitreal aflibercept versus sham were 0.4 (0.25–0.62) for 10 DA or more of RNP and 0.8 (0.68–0.90) for MNP, indicating a lower risk for these outcomes with intravitreal aflibercept than with sham. Mean BCVA change was greater in intravitreal aflibercept- versus sham-treated eyes, with less than 10 DA and 10 DA or more of RNP at baseline (+17.5 vs. +0.8 letters and +18.3 vs. ?4.1 letters, respectively) and with and without baseline MNP (+15.7 vs. +0.3 letters and +17.1 vs. +0.4 letters, respectively). Agreement between baseline RNP and MNP status was low (κ = 0.12). The proportions of patients with 1 or more ocular serious adverse event in the intravitreal aflibercept- and sham-treated groups, respectively, were 3.2% and 11.3%. Conclusions: At W24, visual and anatomic improvements, including perfusion status, were greater in eyes treated with intravitreal aflibercept than in eyes treated with sham, regardless of baseline RNP or MNP status. ? 2019 American Academy of Ophthalmology",,aflibercept; retinal; adult; Article; best corrected visual acuity; central retina vein occlusion; central retinal thickness; controlled study; corneal abrasion; drug efficacy; drug safety; electroretinography; endophthalmitis; eye disease; human; intrarater reliability; iris neovascularization; macular edema; macular ischemia; macular retinal capillary nonperfusion; major clinical study; multicenter study; observational study; ophthalmoscopy; optical coherence tomography; optical coherence tomography angiography; outcome assessment; perfusion; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; reperfusion injury; retina artery occlusion; retina hemorrhage; retinal capillary nonperfusion; risk factor; therapy effect; visual acuity; visual field; visual system parameters; vitreous body detachment,2-s2.0-85070435666

Specific catalytic inhibitors of EZH2 have high anti-tumour activity, particularly in lymphomas with EZH2 activating mutations. However, the clinical benefits of EZH2 catalytic inhibitors in tumours overexpressing EZH2 are still limited. Here, we identified NPD13668, a novel modulator of EZH2-mediated gene silencing, from 329,049 small chemical compounds using a cell-based high-throughput screening assay. NPD13668 reactivated the expression of silenced H3K27me3 target genes together with depletion of the H3K27me3 modification. In addition, NPD13668 repressed the cell growth of prostate cancer cell lines (PC3 and LNCaP) and ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and NIH-OVCAR3). NPD13668 partially inhibited the methyltransferase activity of EZH2 in vitro. Genome-wide expression analysis revealed that after NPD13668 treatment, about half of the upregulated genes overlapped with genes upregulated after treatment with GSK126, well-known EZH2 catalytic inhibitor, indicating that NPD13668 is a potential modulator of EZH2 methyltransferase activity. Our data demonstrated that targeting the pharmacological inhibition of EZH2 activity by NPD13668 might be a novel cancer treatment. ? The Author(s) 2019.

Furthermore, the operational accuracy of this device under no load was evaluated. We devised a concept for correcting the twist of patients by adjustment of the three rotation (pitch, roll, and yaw) angles in two independent plates connected by a joint (fulcrum). The two plates (head and neck plate and body plate) rotate around the fulcrum by adjusting screws under each of them. A prototype device was created to materialize this concept. First, after all adjusting screws were set to the zero position, the rotation angle of each plate was measured by a digital goniometer. Repeatability was evaluated by performing 20 repeated measurements. Next, to confirm the rotational accuracy of each plate of the prototype device, the calculated rotation angles for 20 combinations of patterns of traveled distances of the adjusting screws were compared with those measured by the digital goniometer and cone-beam computed tomography (CT). The repeatability (standard deviation: SD) of the pitch, roll, and yaw angles of the head and neck plate was 0.04°, 0.05°, and 0.03°, and the repeatability (SD) of the body plate was 0.05°, 0.04°, and 0.04°, respectively. The mean differences?±?SD between the calculated and measured pitch, roll, and yaw angles for the head and neck plate with the digital goniometer were 0.00?±?0.06°, ?0.01?±?0.06°, and ?0.04?±?0.04°, respectively. The differences for the body plate were ?0.03?±?0.04°, 0.03?±?0.05°, and 0.02?±?0.05°, respectively. Results of the cone-beam CT were similar to those of the digital goniometer. The prototype device exhibited good performance regarding the rotational accuracy and repeatability under no load. The clinical implementation of this concept is expected to reduce the residual error of the patient position due to the twist. ? 2019 The Authors.

Using data from the National Cancer Registry in Japan launched in January 2016, we will conduct the first nationwide population-based study in Japan to compare incidence of death by suicide, other externally caused injuries (ECIs) and cardiovascular disease following a cancer diagnosis with that of the general population in Japan. We will also aim to identify the patient subgroups and time periods associated with particularly high risk. Methods and analysis Our study subjects will consist of cancer cases diagnosed between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2016 in Japan and they will be observed until 31 December 2018. We will calculate standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) and excess absolute risks (EARs) for suicide, other ECIs and cardiovascular death compared with the general population in Japan, after adjustment for sex, age and prefecture. SMRs and EARs will be calculated separately in relation to a number of factors: Sex; age at diagnosis; time since cancer diagnosis; prefecture of residence at diagnosis; primary tumour site; behaviour code of tumour; extension of tumour; whether definitive surgery of the primary site was performed; and presence/absence of multiple primary tumours. Ethics and dissemination The study protocol was approved by the institutional review board and ethics committee of the National Cancer Center Japan and Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences. The findings will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. Trial registration number UMIN000035118; Pre-results. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

A systematic review. Objective. To systemically review the previous literature regarding surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). Summary of Background Data. The Lenke classification was published in 2001 as the classification of AIS. Since then, numerous articles have been published reporting the outcomes of surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 AIS. Methods. The electronic databases PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were queried up to Aug 2018 for articles regarding surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 AIS. Surgical variables, radiographic assessments, and clinical outcomes of surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 AIS were summarized. Results. Fifty studies met the inclusion criteria. The average fused levels, % correction of thoracolumbar/lumbar curve at final follow-up, and % correction of thoracic curve at final follow-up for anterior and posterior procedures were reported to be 3.6–5.3 and 4.3–7.8 levels, 53–86 and 55–94% and 17–52 and 19–67%, respectively. Average coronal balance was imbalanced (20mm) at preoperation in 22/43 reporting study groups and balanced (<20mm) at final follow-up in all 37 reporting study groups. Scoliosis Research Society Version 22 scores showed no difference between anterior and posterior procedures in most of the reporting studies (5/6). Conclusion. Overall, the outcomes of surgical treatment of Lenke type 5 AIS are excellent. The thoracic curve was spontaneously corrected after surgery and coronal balance after surgery was better than before surgery. Both anterior and posterior procedures demonstrated satisfactory outcomes.

In the present study, the authors clarified the role of EPA in cancer angiogenesis against colon cancer?associated fibroblasts (CAFs) from the colon stroma. With established human CAFs and normal fibroblasts from colon stroma (NFs), the authors evaluated IL?6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secretion with or without EPA treatment using ELISA. The signal inhibition of mitogen?activated protein kinase (ERK) in CAFs by EPA was evaluated using western blotting. In vitro anti?angiogenesis effects were evaluated by the angiogenesis assay on Matrigel using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) cultured with the supernatant obtained from CAF cultures with or without EPA. IL?6 secretion was greater from CAFs compared with that from NFs and stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in greater IL?6 secretion from the two fibroblast types compared with that from fibroblasts without LPS stimulation. While LPS stimulation increased VEGF secretion from the two fibroblast types, EPA decreased IL?6 and VEGF secretion from CAFs. Western blotting revealed that the addition of 30 ?M EPA inhibited the ERK phosphorylation signal in CAFs. Furthermore, the angiogenesis assay with Matrigel revealed that the CAF culture supernatants treated with EPA suppressed tubular formation in HUVECs. These reductions may have been caused by the inhibition of ERK phosphorylation by EPA. Thus, EPA reduces cancer angiogenesis associated with CAFs. Additional studies will be needed to clarify the continuous anti?angiogenetic effect of chemotherapy using angiogenesis inhibitors (e.g. bevacizumab and aflibercept) in conjunction with or without EPA, and the clinical usage of EPA in conjunction with chemotherapy in vivo. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

However, further exploration of target molecules is urgently needed for the development of more effective therapies. In the present study, we studied the expression of CD48 in a total of 74 primary MM samples derived from patients to evaluate SLAMF2 (CD48) as a candidate in mAb therapy for MM. Of 74 samples, 39 were subjected to SLAMF7 analysis. Most of the MM cells, defined as CD38 and CD138 double-positive cells, showed strong expression of CD48 or SLAMF7 independent of disease stage or treatment history. In these 39 samples, most MM cells showed expression of both SLAMF7 and CD48; however, several samples showed expression of either only CD48 or only SLAMF7, including seven cases that were only highly positive for SLAMF7, and five that were only highly positive for CD48. Our study demonstrates that the immune receptor CD48 is overexpressed on MM cells together with SLAMF7, and that CD48 may be considered as an alternative target for treatment of MM in cases showing weak expression of SLAMF7. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Hematology.",CD48; Flow cytometry; Multiple myeloma; SLAMF,"ADP ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase 1; bortezomib; CD48 antigen; lenalidomide; monoclonal antibody; pomalidomide; syndecan 1; ADP ribosyl cyclase/cyclic ADP ribose hydrolase 1; CD38 protein, human; CD48 antigen; CD48 protein, human; immunoglobulin receptor; membrane protein; monoclonal antibody; SDC1 protein, human; signaling lymphocytic activation molecule; SLAMF7 protein, human; syndecan 1; adult; aged; Article; chromosome aberration; clinical feature; controlled study; female; human; human cell; karyotype; major clinical study; male; multiple myeloma; myeloma cell; protein expression; very elderly; chemistry; immunology; metabolism; multiple myeloma; ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1; Antibodies, Monoclonal; CD48 Antigen; Humans; Membrane Glycoproteins; Multiple Myeloma; Receptors, Immunologic; Signaling Lymphocytic Activation Molecule Family; Syndecan-1",2-s2.0-85066121365

In this study, we aimed to explore therapeutic approaches and outcomes in patients with extranasal NKTCL in current clinical practice. A data set of patients with newly diagnosed NKTCL who were diagnosed at 31 institutes in Japan between 2000 and 2013 was used for analysis. The patients’ fitness for steroid, methotrexate, ifosfamide, l-asparaginase, and etoposide (SMILE) chemotherapy was assessed using the major inclusion criteria of the SMILE phase 2 study. Of 358 patients, 47 (13%) had extranasal NKTCL. The most frequent extranodal sites of involvement in extranasal NKTCL were skin/subcutaneous tissue (n = 18). Six (13%) of the patients with extranasal NKTCL had localized disease and were diagnosed before 2010. With a median follow-up of 5.8?years, the 2-year overall survival (OS) in patients with nasal and extranasal NKTCL was 70% (95% confidence interval [CI], 65–75%) and 34% (95% CI, 21–47%), respectively. OS in patients with nasal NKTCL had a trend toward better according to treatment era (P = 0.063). In contrast, no obvious improvement of OS was observed in extranasal NKTCL (P = 0.43). The major inclusion criteria of the SMILE-P2 were met in 21% (10/47) of patients with extranasal NKTCL and 60% (188/311) of those with nasal NKTCL (P < 0.001). Despite the advent of new treatments for ENKL, OS remains unfavorable in extranasal NKTCL.

Few studies have reported the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies for intestinal Beh?et's disease due to its rarity. Aims: The aim was to examine the efficacy of anti-tumor necrosis factor-α antibodies for intestinal Beh?et's disease in real-world practice. Methods: This was a retrospective review of medical records at 4 hospitals in Japan. Global gastrointestinal symptom and endoscopic assessment scores were analyzed in intestinal Beh?et's disease patients given anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents at 3 and 12 months after the start of therapy. Results: Of 53 intestinal Beh?et's disease patients, 22 received anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibody treatment. At the first line, 14 were given adalimumab, and 8 were given infliximab. After 3 and 12 months of treatment, 7 and 11 patients showed complete response of gastrointestinal symptom scores, respectively, and 5 and 9 showed complete remission of the endoscopic assessment score, respectively. Three patients switched anti-tumor necrosis factor-α agents. Conclusion: Anti-tumor necrosis factor-α monoclonal antibodies are effective for refractory intestinal Beh?et's disease in real-world situations.

This study aimed to develop a Japanese version of the International Hip Outcome Tools “iHOT12J”, and to establish its reliability, validity, and responsiveness. Methods: To assess test-retest reliability, an identical set of patients reported outcome measures with five qualitative scoring measures including iHOT12; these were filled out by each patient twice. Reliability was explored using Cronbachss alpha and intraclass correlation coefficient. The Bland–Altman plot was used to explore the absolute agreement. To evaluate validity, we examined the relationships between SF36 and iHOT12. Responsiveness was assessed by comparing the smallest detectable change to the minimal important change by applying an anchor-based approach. Results: Fifty patients (51 joints) were analyzed from March 2016 to October 2017 in Japanese four facility. The Cronbach α coefficient was 0.90 and the average value of intraclass coefficient (ICC) was 0.89. Bland–Altman plot analysis showed a solid agreement. Regarding the validity, the Spearman rank correlation coefficients were strong with PF (r = 0.69, p < 0.01), BP (r = 0.71, p < 0.01) and PCS (r = 0.69, p < 0.01). The smallest detectable change (3.19) was smaller than the minimum important change (12.40).

We sought to describe the current practice, effectiveness, and adverse effects of pharmacotherapy for hypoactive delirium in patients with advanced cancer, and to explore predictors of the deterioration of delirium symptoms after starting pharmacotherapy. Subjects, Materials, and Methods: We included data of patients with advanced cancer who were diagnosed with hypoactive delirium and received pharmacotherapy for treatment of delirium. This was a pharmacovigilance study characterized by prospective registries and systematic data-recording using internet technology, conducted among 38 palliative care teams and/or units. The severity of delirium and other outcomes were assessed using established measures at days 0 (T0), 3 (T1), and 7 (T2). Results: Available data were obtained from 218 patients. The most frequently used agent was haloperidol (37%). A total of 67 and 42 patients (31% and 19%) had died or discontinued pharmacotherapy by T1 and T2, respectively. Delirium symptoms deteriorated between T0 and T1, but this trend did not reach statistical significance. The most prevalent adverse event was sedation (9%). Delirium severity worsened after starting pharmacotherapy in 121 patients (56%) at T1. In patients whose death was expected within a few days and those with delirium caused by organ failure, symptoms of delirium were significantly more likely to deteriorate after starting pharmacotherapy. Conclusion: Current pharmacotherapy for hypoactive delirium in patients with advanced cancer is not recommended, especially in those whose death is expected within a few days and in those with delirium caused by organ failure. Implications for Practice: Delirium is common among patients with advanced cancer, and hypoactive delirium is the dominant motor subtype in the palliative care setting. Pharmacotherapy is recommended and regularly used to treat delirium. This article describes the effectiveness and adverse effects of pharmacotherapy for hypoactive delirium in patients with advanced cancer. The findings of this study do not support the use of pharmacotherapy for treatment of hypoactive delirium in the palliative care setting. Pharmacotherapy should especially be avoided in patients whose death is expected within a few days and in those with delirium caused by organ failure. ?

Objective diagnostic and predictive methods for PPD are important for early detection and appropriate intervention. DNA methylation has been recognized as a potential biomarker for major depressive disorder. In this study, we used methylation analysis and peripheral blood to search for biomarkers that could to lead to the development a predictive method for PPD. Methods: Study participants included 36 pregnant women (18 cases and 18 controls determined after childbirth). Genome-wide DNA methylation profiles were obtained by analysis with an Infinium Human Methylation 450BeadChip. The association of DNA methylation status at each DNA methylation site with PPD was assessed using linear regression analysis. We also conducted functional enrichment analysis of PPD using The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery 6.8 to explore enriched functional-related gene groups for PPD. Results: In the analysis with postpartum depressed state as an independent variable, the difference in methylation frequency between the postpartum non-depressed group and the postpartum depressed group was small, and sites with genome-wide significant differences were not confirmed. After analysis by The Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery 6.8, we revealed four gene ontology terms, including axon guidance, related to postpartum depression. Conclusions: These findings may help with the development of an objective predictive method for PPD. ? 2019 The Author(s).",DNA methylation; Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS); Epigenome-wide association study; Postpartum depression,adult; Article; axon guidance; case control study; clinical article; controlled study; DNA determination; DNA methylation; female; gene; gene ontology; genome-wide association study; human; postnatal depression; prediction; pregnant woman; questionnaire; self report,2-s2.0-85067559090

Results: Male subjects with higher daily life activity as well as with higher leisure-time exercise volume had a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome, independently with each other. Female subjects with higher daily life activity also had a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome. Particularly, male and female subjects with the highest daily life activity quartile showed considerably low odds ratios of 0.66 (95% CI, 0.53–0.81) and 0.64 (0.52–0.79), respectively, for low HDL-cholesterol even after the adjustment for BMI compared with the first quartile. Meanwhile, male subjects with the higher leisure-time exercise showed a quite lower prevalence of elevated triglycerides. Higher moderate-intensity exercise was more intensely associated with a lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome and some of its traits in both sexes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that higher daily life activity and higher moderate-intensity exercise may be independently associated with a lower risk of metabolic syndrome in Japanese adults. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cross-sectional study; Daily life activity; Leisure-time exercise; Metabolic syndrome,glucose; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; adult; aged; Article; blood pressure; body height; body mass; body weight; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; daily life activity; disease association; exercise; exercise intensity; female; gender; glucose blood level; human; Japanese (people); leisure; lifestyle; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; risk reduction; triacylglycerol blood level,2-s2.0-85064647979

Materials and methods: Dual arterial phase CT was performed during pre-TACE angiography in 73 patients with 139 HCC. Ten HCC underwent this procedure twice, so the total number of examined HCC was 149. Early and late arterial phase images were obtained 6 seconds after injection of an iodinated contrast material serially during a single breath-hold. The feeding artery was defined as the branch of the hepatic artery that was connected to the enhanced areas of the tumor. For HCC that could not be visualized on the early arterial phase images, fusion images superimposing the early and late arterial phase images were constructed. Furthermore, technical success defined as successful catheterization of the subsegmental or more distal feeding artery was evaluated. Results: The feeding artery was correctly identified on dual arterial phase CT in 146 of the 149 tumors (98.0%). In two HCC, the feeding arteries could not be identified due to severe motion artifacts, and in one, due to the presence of anastomosis between the right and left hepatic arteries. Catheterization of the subsegmental feeding artery was successful in all TACE procedures (technical success rate: 100%). Conclusion: Performing dual arterial phase CT during angiography appears to be useful for identifying the feeding arteries of HCC. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",CT during angiography; Feeding artery identification; Hepatocellular carcinoma; TACE,analgesic agent; epirubicin; gelatin; gelatin sponge; iodinated contrast medium; iodinated poppyseed oil; oypalomin; unclassified drug; abdominal pain; adult; aged; angiography; Article; cancer diagnosis; catheterization; chemoembolization; female; fever; hepatic artery; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; priority journal; retrospective study; spiral computer assisted tomography,2-s2.0-85061902976

However, no treatment strategies have been established yet for such patients. This study compared the effects of proton pump inhibitor (PPI) treatment in patients with GERD-associated FD among three groups with varying severity levels of GERD symptoms. Methods: The patients with GERD and FD symptoms received PPI treatment for 4?weeks after endoscopy, and the severity of the symptoms and responses to treatment were evaluated at before and after 4?weeks of treatment using the Gastroesophageal Reflux and Dyspepsia Therapeutic Efficacy and Satisfaction Test (GERD-TEST). The patients were divided into three groups in accordance with the severity of the GERD symptoms as assessed by the GERD symptom subscale (SS) scores of pre-treatment. Results: Data from 233 cases of 40 mild, 151 moderate and 42 severe symptoms were analyzed. Analysis of the pre-treatment scores for each symptom revealed that a higher GERD-SS score was significantly associated with higher scores on any kind of FD score. Four weeks of PPI treatment significantly and markedly alleviated any of GERD/FD symptoms. Most importantly, change in the score for each symptom after 4 weeks of treatment relative to the pre-treatment score was significantly greater in the groups with more severe GERD-SS. Conclusion: FD symptoms associated with more severe GERD symptoms are supposed to be acid-related dyspepsia, and PPI monotherapy is recommended as the treatment of first choice in such patients. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Acid-related dyspepsia; Functional dyspepsia (FD); Gastroesophageal reflux disease; Proton pump inhibitor,esomeprazole; lansoprazole; omeprazole; rabeprazole; adult; Article; clinical outcome; disease severity; drug efficacy; dyspepsia; female; gastroesophageal reflux; gastroesophageal reflux and dyspepsia efficacy and satisfaction test; gastrointestinal endoscopy; gastrointestinal symptom; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; monotherapy; multicenter study; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; questionnaire; scoring system; treatment duration,2-s2.0-85060605816

However, there is little evidence available on long-term outcomes and maintenance treatments after TAC therapy, especially in cases with previous tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor therapy. Methods: Long-term outcomes and remission induction after TAC treatment were retrospectively examined in refractory UC patients with and without previous TNF-α inhibitor therapy. Results: The mean disease activity index and the endoscopic activity index scores decreased significantly during the 12-week treatment after TAC therapy in both groups, showing a significantly greater decrease in the group without TNF-α inhibitor therapy than in the group with previous TNF-α inhibitor therapy. One year or more after TAC therapy, TNF-α inhibitor and/or azathioprine was used as maintenance therapy in most cases in the group without previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment, while azathioprine was primarily used in the group with previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment. Colectomy was performed in 45.5% (5/11) and 15.6% (7/45) of the groups with and without previous TNF-α inhibitor therapy, respectively, and the group without previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment had a better colectomy-free rate than the group with previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment after TAC therapy on Kaplan–Meier analysis. Conclusions: TAC is effective for remission induction in refractory UC patients with and without previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment. Maintenance medication after TAC therapy is an issue for the future, especially in UC cases with previous TNF-α inhibitor treatment failure. ? 2019 The Authors.

We examined the association between environmental factors and the development of CD in Japanese focusing on passive smoking. Methods We conducted a multicenter case-control study and compared the environmental factors of 93 cases who were newly diagnosed with CD to the environmental factors of 132 controls (hospital-, age-, and sex-matched patients with other diseases). The odds ratio (OR) of each factor for the development of CD and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a logistic regression model. The association between the details of passive smoking history and the development of CD was examined for those who had an active smoking history ""no"". Odds ratios of number of passively smoked cigarettes (per day), time of passive smoking (per day) and period of passive smoking (year) were calculated using ""passive smoking 'No'"" as a reference. Results History of appendicitis, family history of inflammatory bowel disease, and active smoking history were not significantly associated with the development of CD. Drinking history showed a decreased OR for the development of CD (0.39, 0.19-0.77). ""Passive smoking Yes"" showed significantly increased OR (2.49, 1.09-5.73). Regarding the association between passive smoking and the development of CD, the OR increased as the number of cigarettes per day, smoking time per day, and smoking duration increased, and there was a dose-response relationship (trend P = 0.024, 0.032, 0.038). Conclusions The association between environmental factors and the development of CD among Japanese was examined by case-control study. It was suggested that the passive smoking history may be associated to the development of CD. ? 2019 Kondo et al.",,adult; appendicitis; Article; case control study; cigarette smoking; controlled study; Crohn disease; disease association; drinking behavior; environmental factor; family history; female; human; Japan; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; medical history; passive smoking; pathogenesis; adverse event; clinical trial; Crohn disease; environment; multicenter study; passive smoking; young adult; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Crohn Disease; Environment; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Tobacco Smoke Pollution; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85067121812

Recent genome-wide association studies have discovered CKD susceptibility variants. We developed a genetic risk score (GRS) based on CKD-associated variants and assessed a possibility that the GRS can improve the discrimination capability for the prevalence of CKD in a Japanese population. The present study consists of 11 283 participants randomly selected from 12 Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study sites. Individual GRS was constructed combining 18 single-nucleotide polymorphisms identified in a Japanese population. Participants with eGFR &lt;60 mL/min per 1.73 m 2 was defined as case (stage 3 CKD or higher) in this study. Logistic regression analysis was used to examine the association between the GRS and CKD risk with adjustment for sex, age, hypertension and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The frequency of individuals with CKD was 8.3%, which was relatively low compared with those previously reported in a Japanese population. The odds ratio of having CKD was 1.120 (95% confidence interval: 1.042–1.203) per 10 GRS increment in the fully adjusted model (P = 0.002). The C-statistic was significantly increased in the model with the GRS, comparing with the model without the GRS (0.720 vs 0.719, P difference = 0.008). Increment of the GRS was associated with increased risk of CKD. Additionally, the GRS significantly improved the discriminatory ability of CKD prevalence in a Japanese population; however, the improvement of discriminatory ability brought about by the GRS seemed to be small compared with that of non-genetic CKD risk factors. ? 2018 Asian Pacific Society of Nephrology",chronic kidney disease; estimated glomerular filtration rate; genetic epidemiology; genetic risk score,"adult; age; Article; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; controlled study; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic risk score; human; hypertension; Japan; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; scoring system; sex; single nucleotide polymorphism; Asian continental ancestry group; chronic kidney failure; clinical trial; epidemiology; ethnology; genetic marker; genetic predisposition; genetics; middle aged; molecular epidemiology; multicenter study; phenotype; risk assessment; single nucleotide polymorphism; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Female; Genetic Markers; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Epidemiology; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prevalence; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85065205873

Methods: We conducted a hospital-based multicenter case-control study in East Asia including 921 cases and 806 controls. We estimated the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for HNC risks by using logistic regression, adjusting on potential confounders. Results: Compared to normal BMI at interview (18.5–&lt;25 kg/m 2 ), being underweight (BMI &lt; 18.5 kg/m 2 ) was associated with a higher HNC risk (OR = 2.71, 95% CI 1.40–5.26).

However, being underweight at 5 years or 2 years before interview was not associated with a higher risk of HNC. Conclusion: We observed an inverse association between BMI and HNC risk, which is consistent with previous studies in other geographic regions.

One of the reasons for this is the acquisition of Gem resistance (Gem-R). To elucidate the mechanism of Gem-R, two Gem-R PaCa cell lines were established from AsPC-1 and MIA PaCa-2 cells. It was demonstrated that expression of interleukin?8 (IL?8) mRNA was significantly upregulated in Gem-R PaCa cells by cDNA microarray and RT-qPCR analyses. Increased IL?8 secretion by Gem?R cells was confirmed by cytokine array and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Moreover, we found that co-culture with Gem-R PaCa cells significantly enhanced tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, and treatment with an anti-CXCR2 (main receptor for IL?8) antibody significantly prevented this effect. We previously reported that a chemokine network centered on the IL-8/CXCR2 axis plays an important role in PaCa angiogenesis, and suppression of this axis has an antitumor effect. Since acquisition of Gem-R increased IL-8 production and consequently increased tumor angiogenesis, the IL-8/CXCR2 axis may be a potential novel therapeutic target for PaCa after acquiring Gem-R. ? 2019 Spandidos Publications.

Patients with psoriasis, a chronic immunological skin inflammation, often develop diabetes. However, it is not clear to date how psoriasis leads to, or is correlated with, glucose intolerance. Here, we investigate whether psoriasis itself is correlated with hyperglycemia in humans and mice. In patients, the severity of psoriasis was correlated with high blood glucose levels, and treatment of psoriasis by phototherapy improved insulin secretion. Imiquimod-induced systemic and cutaneous inflammation in mice, with features of human psoriasis, also resulted in hyperglycemia. Although it should be determined if psoriasis-like cutaneous inflammation alone can induce hyperglycemia, imiquimod-treated mice showed impairment of insulin secretion without significant islet inflammation. Administration of anti-IL-17A monoclonal antibody improved hyperglycemia in patients with psoriasis and imiquimod-treated mice with psoriasiform features. These results suggest that hyperglycemia is highly associated with psoriasis, mainly through IL-17. ? 2019 The Authors",,gamma interferon; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; imiquimod; immunoglobulin G; insulin; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 17 monoclonal antibody; interleukin 2; interleukin 2 receptor alpha; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; ixekizumab; monoclonal antibody; secukinumab; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; dermatitis; gene expression; glucose blood level; glucose tolerance test; human; hyperglycemia; inflammation; insulin release; insulin tolerance test; lipid diet; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet; phototherapy; priority journal; psoriasis,2-s2.0-85064328654

Anti-C1q antibodies (anti-C1q) are associated with the activation of complement pathway in lupus patients, while it remains unclear in RPL. Firstly, we showed that both the prevalence and titre of anti-C1q were significantly higher in unexplained RPL than in healthy parous individuals. Secondly, we established the murine model of anti-C1q induced pregnancy loss using a monoclonal anti-mouse C1q antibody, JL-1. In mice treated with JL-1, high ratio of pregnancy loss and fetal growth restriction were frequently observed and complement activation occurred. C5a receptor (C5aR) blockade cancelled these pathogenic changes in mice treated with JL-1. In conclusion, our study reveals an association between the prevalence of anti-C1q and RPL. Additionally, our murine model has indicated that anti-C1q can induce reproductive failure, which might be ameliorated by therapy targeting the C5-C5aR axis. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Anti-C1q autoantibody; Complement activation; Recurrent pregnancy loss,complement component C1q antibody; complement component C5a receptor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody titer; Article; complement activation; cross-sectional study; female; human; immunopathogenesis; major clinical study; mouse; nonhuman; prevalence; priority journal; recurrent abortion; retrospective study,2-s2.0-85064320690

Methods: Renal papillary tissues were obtained from 23 idiopathic calcium oxalate and seven calcium phosphate stone patients who had undergone endoscopic lithotripsy. Samples were individually collected from two different regions in each patient: the papillary mucosa containing Randall's plaque and mucosa not containing Randall's plaque. A microarray analysis was carried out on those tissues to compare their gene expression patterns. Furthermore, a causal pathway analysis comparing their differences was carried out. Results: Cluster analysis showed that gene expression profiles of calcium phosphate stone patients markedly differed from those of calcium oxalate stone patients. Disease and function analysis showed that Randall's plaque-containing tissues of calcium phosphate stone-forming patients had significantly higher movement and migration of mononuclear leukocytes, and lower tendency toward infection and lymph node formation than Randall's plaque-containing tissues of calcium oxalate stone formers. Additional pathway analysis showed increased immune cell signaling in calcium phosphate formers, such as the helper T?cell 1 and 2 pathways, which was confirmed by their messenger ribonucleic acid expression. Conclusions: The present results show the upregulation of helper T-cell signaling pathways in Randall's plaque-containing papillae in calcium phosphate, but not in calcium oxalate stone formers. Thus, helper T-cell immune responses and the related inflammatory processes seem to lead to the formation of calcium phosphate stones on Randall's plaques. ? 2019 The Japanese Urological Association",calcium oxalate; calcium phosphate; kidney stone disease; Randall's plaque; renal papillae,calcium oxalate; calcium phosphate; CD28 antigen; CD3 antigen; complementary DNA; inducible T cell costimulator ligand; messenger RNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 2; adult; Article; body mass; calcium oxalate urolithiasis; calcium phosphate urolithiasis; cell structure; cellular immunity; clinical article; controlled study; endoscopic therapy; female; gene expression profiling; helper cell; human; human tissue; hydronephrosis; idiopathic disease; immunocompetent cell; inflammation; kidney papilla; leukocyte migration; lithotripsy; male; microarray analysis; middle aged; mononuclear cell; nephrolithiasis; priority journal; Randall plaque; signal transduction; Th1 cell; Th2 cell,2-s2.0-85063580516

However, no predictive biomarkers have been identified for RAM treatment in AGC. Methods: We retrospectively identified 26 patients who received either RAM monotherapy or RAM + PTX therapy for AGC refractory to fluoropyrimidine and platinum agents from 2015 to 2018?at Nagoya City University Hospital. First, we extracted RNA using gastric cancer (GC) tissues from two responders and two non-responders, and then analyzed 24 VEGFR-related angiogenic genes. Subsequently, we examined the relationship between the expression of each angiogenic gene and RAM clinical activity in the entire cohort. Finally, we validated using in vitro angiogenesis assays using GC cells and microvascular endothelial cells. Results: We identified five angiogenic genes with aberrant expression between RAM responders and non-responders and placental growth factor (PlGF) was the most significant gene among them. Overall survival (P = 0.046) and progression-free survival (P = 0.016) were significantly shorter in the PlGF-high group than in the PlGF-low group. Overall response rates were 50% in the PlGF-low group and 0% in the PlGF-high group. In GC cells co-cultured with endothelial cells, PlGF gene silencing from GC cells significantly reinforced the inhibitory effect of RAM in the in vitro angiogenesis assay (tube formation assay and endothelial migration) through the inactivation of ERK, in comparison to the control GC cells. Conclusions: PlGF gene expression in gastric cancer tissues could be a predictive indicator of AGC treatment by RAM. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Angiogenesis; Biomarker; Gastric cancer; PlGF; Ramucirumab; VEGF,"biological marker; cisplatin; docetaxel; fluoropyrimidine; mitogen activated protein kinase; oxaliplatin; paclitaxel; placental growth factor; plxnd1 protein; ramucirumab; RNA; sema3b protein; semaphorin 3F; trastuzumab; unclassified drug; vasculotropin A; vasculotropin receptor; antineoplastic agent; monoclonal antibody; paclitaxel; PGF protein, human; placental growth factor; ramucirumab; tumor marker; adult; advanced cancer; aged; angiogenesis assay; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer patient; clinical article; coculture; controlled study; endothelium cell; enzyme inactivation; female; gastric cancer cell line; gene expression; gene identification; gene silencing; human; human tissue; in vitro study; male; monotherapy; overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; retrospective study; RNA extraction; stomach cancer; treatment response; cohort analysis; comparative study; genetics; metabolism; middle aged; neovascularization (pathology); pathology; stomach tumor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neovascularization, Pathologic; Paclitaxel; Placenta Growth Factor; Retrospective Studies; Stomach Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85063144127

Among these, facial nerve tumors are rare but should be considered in the differential diagnosis of facial palsy. Palsies due to facial nerve tumors usually present with slow onset but occasionally present as acute episodes. In such cases, facial nerve decompression is the treatment of choice to allow the tumor room to grow without compressing the nerve or its blood supply. We describe a case of severe, acute facial palsy presenting with a spindle-shaped bone erosion on the mastoid portion of the facial canal. Although facial neuroma was suspected preoperatively, emergency decompression surgery revealed that an unusual inflammatory pseudotumor was responsible for the finding. Postoperative histological analysis revealed extensive destruction of the nerve fibers, with extensive infiltration of foamy macrophages containing characteristic, diastase-resistant, periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive inclusions, which are hallmark of the uncommon bacterial infections.

Several studies have demonstrated TP53INP1 downregulation in many cancers. In this study, we investigated the correlations of TP53INP1 mRNA expression in breast cancer tissues with prognosis and the correlations of microRNAs that regulate TP53INP1 expression in breast cancer patients with long follow-up. Methods: A total of 453 invasive breast cancer tissues were analyzed for TP53INP1 mRNA expression. We examined correlations of clinicopathological factors and expression levels of TP53INP1 mRNA in these samples. The expressions of miR-155, miR-569 and markers associated with tumor-initiating capacity were also analyzed. The median follow-up period was 9.0 years. Results: We found positive correlations between low expression of TP53INP1 mRNA and shorter disease-free survival and overall survival in breast cancer patients (P = 0.0002 and P0.0001, respectively), as well as in estrogen receptor ? (ER?)-positive patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy (P = 0.01 and P = 0.0008, respectively). No correlations were found in ER?-negative patients. Low TP53INP1 mRNA levels positively correlated with higher grade and ER?-negativity. Multivariate analysis indicated that TP53INP1 mRNA level was an independent risk factor for overall survival both in overall breast cancer patients (hazard ratio, 2.13; 95% confidence interval, 1.17-3.92) and ER?-positive patients (hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.18-4.64). Conclusions: We show that low expression of TP53INP1 is an independent factor of poor prognosis in breast cancer patients, especially ER?-positive patients. TP53INP1 might be a promising candidate biomarker and therapeutic target in ER?-positive breast cancer patients. ? The Author(s) 2019.

Navigated focal laser photocoagulation was delivered to the microaneurysms on ICGA using Navilas ? (OD-OS GmbH, Germany). Central retinal thickness (CRT) and macular volume (MV) were measured by Cirrus HD-OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec). At 6?months, the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), CRT and MV were compared to the values measured on day 0. The distances from the center of fovea to the closest microaneurysms (MAs) were measured on the pre-planned Navilas ? image. Results: All eyes had previous treatment history.

However, the long-term outcomes of VATS lobectomy vs. thoracotomy lobectomy remain controversial. Methods: We reviewed the clinical data of 202 consecutive patients who underwent lobectomy for clinical stage IA NSCLC at our institution between January, 2008 and December, 2013. Stage IA NSCLC was confirmed pathologically in 162 of these patients, 60 of whom underwent VATS lobectomy and 102 of whom underwent thoracotomy lobectomy. We compared the perioperative clinical factors and outcomes of these two groups, using a propensity score-matched analysis. Results: In an analysis of 58 matched cases, the VATS group showed less blood loss, a shorter duration of chest tube placement, a shorter postoperative hospital stay, and a lower peak C-reactive protein value, despite a longer operative time. The VATS group also had significantly longer survival than the thoracotomy group [5-year overall survival, 100% vs. 87%, respectively (p = 0.01); 5-year disease-free survival, 100% vs. 86% (p = 0.03)]. Conclusions: These findings suggest that VATS may have better long-term as well as short-term outcomes than thoracotomy for patients with early-stage NSCLC. ? 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",C-reactive protein (CRP); Lobectomy; Long-term outcome; Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS),"antineoplastic agent; C reactive protein; loxoprofen; ropivacaine; C reactive protein; adult; aged; Article; atelectasis; atrial fibrillation; brain metastasis; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer staging; cancer survival; chylothorax; controlled study; disease free survival; empyema; female; follow up; hoarseness; hospitalization; human; hypoxia; intermethod comparison; lobectomy; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; mediastinum metastasis; non small cell lung cancer; operation duration; outcome assessment; overall survival; pneumonia; postoperative care; postoperative delirium; postoperative hemorrhage; postoperative infection; postoperative pain; smoking; surgical approach; thoracotomy; tumor volume; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; wound infection; length of stay; lung resection; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; procedures; propensity score; survival rate; thoracotomy; time factor; treatment outcome; very elderly; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; C-Reactive Protein; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Humans; Length of Stay; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Operative Time; Pneumonectomy; Propensity Score; Survival Rate; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Thoracotomy; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85057987044

Although studies have found a significant prognostic impact of cancer location for right-sided colon cancers compared with those of the left-side, evidence is lacking in a Japanese population. Therefore, we investigated 5-year net survival in colon cancer by tumor site in a Japanese population. Methods: Diagnoses obtained between 2006 and 2008 in 21 population-based cancer registries from the Monitoring of Cancer Incidence in Japan (MCIJ) project were used. Colon cancer patients were categorized as having right-sided (C18.0-18.4) or left-sided colon cancer (C18.5-C18.7). We calculated the 5-year net survival for subjects diagnosed from 2006 until 2008 by anatomical subsite according to sex, age groups, tumor stage at diagnosis. We applied the excess mortality model to calculate excess hazard ratios (EHRs) and 95% confidential intervals (CIs) with and without adjustment for age, sex and cancer stages to evaluate the effect of location of colon cancer. Results: This study analyzed a total of 62,350 colon cancer subjects. Five-year net survivals for subjects with left- and right-sided colon cancer were 74.0% (95% CI, 73.4-74.7%) and 70.4% (95% CI, 69.7-71.0%), respectively. Compared with left-sided colon cancers, the EHR for right-sided colon cancers was 1.20 (95% CI, 1.16-1.25) after adjustment for age, sex and stage. Conclusion: Our study found that the net survival for right-sided colon cancer was significantly lower than that for left-sided colon cancer. The anatomical site of cancer in the colon might be an important stratification factor in future studies of colon cancer. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Anatomical subsite; Colorectal cancer; Net survival; Population-based cancer registries,"adult; age distribution; aged; Article; cancer incidence; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer survival; colon cancer; controlled study; disease surveillance; female; human; Japan; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; sex difference; survival time; colon; colon tumor; epidemiology; incidence; middle aged; mortality; pathology; prognosis; register; survival analysis; survival rate; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colon; Colonic Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Registries; Survival Analysis; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85065537722

We analyzed the efficacy of PDT with G-Ce6 against canine mammary carcinoma (CMC) in vitro and in vivo. The pharmacokinetics of G-Ce6 at 2, 5, and 20 mg/kg was examined in normal dogs, whereas its intracellular localization, concentration, and photodynamic effects were investigated in vitro using CMC cells (SNP cells). G-Ce6 (10 mg/kg) was administered in vivo at 5 min or 3 h before laser irradiation to SNP tumor-bearing murine models. The in vitro study revealed that G-Ce6 was mainly localized to the lysosomes. Cell viability decreased in a G-Ce6 concentration- and light intensity-dependent manner in the PDT group. Cell death induced by PDT with G-Ce6 was not inhibited by an apoptosis inhibitor. In the in vivo study, 5-min-interval PDT exhibited greater effects than 3-h-interval PDT. The mean maximum blood concentration and half-life of G-Ce6 (2 mg/kg) were 15.19 ± 4.44 ?g/mL and 3.02 ± 0.58 h, respectively. Thus, 5-min-interval PDT with G-Ce6 was considered effective against CMC. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

Beamlet restriction limits the incident beamlet angles; thus, the proper planning target volume (PTV) margin may differ from that of the standard treatment plan without beamlet restriction, depending on the patient's movement during dose delivery. Dose distribution changes resulting from patient movement have not been described for treatment plans with beamlet restriction. This study quantified changes in dose distribution to the target and OARs when beamlet restriction is applied to cervical esophageal cancer treatment plan using HT by systematically shifting a phantom. Treatment plans for cervical esophageal cancers with and without beamlet restriction modes [directional block (DB) and nonblock (NB), respectively] were designed for CT images of the RANDO phantom. The PTV margin for the DB mode was set to be the same as that for the NB mode (5?mm). The CT image was intentionally shifted by ±1, ±2, and ±3 voxels in the left–right, anterior–posterior, and superior–inferior directions, and the dose distribution was recalculated for each position using the fluence for the NB or DB mode. When the phantom shift was within the same PTV margin as the NB mode, changes in doses to the targets, lungs, heart, and spinal cord in the DB mode were small as those in the NB mode. In conclusion, the virtual contour shape used in this study would provide safe delivery even with patient movement within the same PTV margin as for the NB mode. ? 2019 The Authors.

A cross-sectional study was performed on 30,108 participants (aged 35-69 years) in the baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Dietary intake was assessed using a 46-item food frequency questionnaire. MetS was diagnosed according to the Joint Interim Statement Criteria of 2009, using body mass index instead of waist circumference. Factor analysis was applied to energy-adjusted intake of 21 nutrients, and three nutrient patterns were extracted: Factor 1 (fiber, potassium and vitamins pattern); Factor 2 (fats and fat-soluble vitamins pattern); and Factor 3 (saturated fatty acids, calcium and vitamin B2 pattern). In multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for sex, age, and other potential confounders, Factor 1 scores were associated with a significantly reduced odds ratio (OR) of MetS and all five components. Factor 2 scores were associated with significantly increased prevalence of MetS, obesity, and high blood pressure. Factor 3 scores were significantly associated with lower OR of MetS, high blood pressure, high serum triglycerides and low HDL cholesterol levels.

However, previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified only six risk-related loci. Methods To identify novel urolithiasis-related loci in the Japanese population, we performed a large-scale GWAS of 11,130 cases and 187,639 controls, followed by a replication analysis of 2289 cases and 3817 controls. Diagnosis of urolithiasis was confirmed either by a clinician or using medical records or self-report. We also assessed the association of urolithiasis loci with 16 quantitative traits, including metabolic, kidney-related, and electrolyte traits (such as body mass index, lipid storage, eGFR, serum uric acid, and serum calcium), using up to 160,000 samples from BioBank Japan. Results The analysis identified 14 significant loci, including nine novel loci. Ten regions showed a significant association with at least one quantitative trait, including metabolic, kidney-related, and electrolyte traits, suggesting a common genetic basis for urolithiasis and these quantitative traits. Four novel loci were related to metabolic traits, obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, or hyperuricemia. The remaining ten loci were associated with kidney- or electrolyte-related traits; these may affect crystallization. Weighted genetic risk score analysis indicated that the highest risk group (top 20%) showed an odds ratio of 1.71 (95% confidence interval, 1.42 to 2.06) - 2.13 (95% confidence interval, 2.00 to 2.27) compared with the reference group (bottom 20%). Conclusions Our findings provide evidence that host genetic factors related to regulation of metabolic and crystallization pathways contribute to the development of urolithiasis.

We conducted a nationwide pediatric pneumococcal infection surveillance study between 2012 and 2014 in Japan. In the surveillance study, we detected multidrug-resistant serotype 15A-CC63 (clonal complex 63) strains (resistant to macrolides, penicillin, cefotaxime, and meropenem); in this study, we analyzed these resistant isolates to determine the dynamics and mechanism of resistance using whole-genome sequencing. In most of the penicillin-, cefotaxime-, and meropenem-resistant strains, recombination occurred in the pbp2x region, resulting in the acquisition of cefotaxime resistance in addition to penicillin and meropenem resistance. In the multidrug-resistant serotype 15A-CC63 strains, we identified a specific clone with ST9084, and all of the isolates were recovered from the Yamaguchi prefecture in Japan. All of the serotype 15A-ST9084 isolates had a novel pbp2x type (pbp2x-JP3) that was inserted by recombination events. The conserved amino acid motif profiles of pbp1a, pbp2b, and pbp2x of the strains were identical to those of serotype 19A-ST320. A Bayesian analysis-based date estimation suggested that this clone emerged in approximately 2002 before the introduction of the PCV in Japan. This clone should be monitored because serotype 15A is not contained in the currently used 13-valent PCV (PCV13), and it was resistant to beta-lactams, which are often used in a clinical setting.

The study aim was to explore predictors of depression relapse after remission using data from our previous multicenter randomized practical trial of patients with major depression. Methods: Our cohort comprised subjects with Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) scores less than 5 after antidepressant treatment for 9 weeks. Relapse was defined as a PHQ-9 score of 5 or more at week 25. We examined patient demographic and clinical characteristics at baseline (age, sex education, job status, marital status, onset age at first depressive episode, number of previous episodes, length of current episode, scores on the nine PHQ-9 criteria at week 0) and Frequency, Intensity, and Burden of Side Effects Rating Scale and PHQ-9 total scores at week 9 (residual symptoms) as potential predictors of depression relapse at week 25. Results: Of 494 patients remitted at week 9, 71 (14.4%) experienced relapse at week 25. Logistic regression analysis showed that lower PHQ-9 depressive mood score at week 0, higher suicidal ideation score at week 0, and total PHQ-9 score at week 9, and greater severity of side effects at week 9 were significant predictors. On the other hand, when relapse was defined as a PHQ-9 score of 10 or more at week 25, there were no significant predictors. Limitations: There may be other important predictors that this study failed to identify and the findings obtained may be sensitive to the specific definition of relapse. Conclusions: Approximately one-seventh of subjects who remitted after 2 months of acute-phase treatment experienced depression relapse within 4 months of remission. Lower depressive mood and higher suicidal ideation upon development of the current depression episode, the presence of residual symptoms, and greater severity of side effects at remission may predict subsequent depression relapse. ? 2019",Antidepressant; Major depression; Predictor; Relapse,"mirtazapine; sertraline; antidepressant agent; adult; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; drug dose titration; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; major depression; male; mood; multicenter study; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; relapse; remission; suicidal ideation; treatment duration; major depression; middle aged; patient health questionnaire; psychology; recurrent disease; statistics and numerical data; time factor; treatment outcome; Adult; Antidepressive Agents; Depressive Disorder, Major; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Health Questionnaire; Recurrence; Suicidal Ideation; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85062419060

Although a few studies have suggested a nonlinear relationship between the maternal whole blood Mn level at delivery and infant birth weight, little is known about the effects of Mn levels during pregnancy on fetal growth, particularly with regard to sex-specific differences. Methods: In this nationwide birth cohort study, we examined the association of maternal blood Mn level during pregnancy with infant birth weight, length, and head circumference in 16,473 mother–infant pairs. Pregnant women living in 15 regions across Japan were recruited between January 2011 and March 2014. The analysis of birth size (8,484 males and 7,989 females) was conducted using a nonlinear spline, followed by the use of quadratic regression or linear regression models. The analysis of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (6,962 males and 6,528 females born vaginally) was conducted using multivariate logistic regression. Additionally, subgroup analysis was conducted according to the timing of blood sampling. Results: The median maternal blood Mn level during pregnancy (i.e., 2nd and 3rd trimesters) was 16.2 ?g/L (range, 4.3–44.5 ?g/L). A positive linear association between the log blood Mn level and head circumference was observed in both male and female infants. However, a nonlinear relationship between the log blood Mn level and birth weight was observed only in male infants, such that the birth weight increased up to a blood Mn level of 18.6 ?g/L. In the subgroup analysis stratified by the timing of maternal blood sampling, this nonlinear relationship was obvious only when sampling was performed in the 3rd trimester. Male infants in the lowest blood Mn level quartile (? 13.2 ?g/L) faced an increased risk of SGA (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.35 [1.04–1.74]), as did those in the highest blood Mn level quartile (? 21.0 ?g/L) when sampling was performed during the 3rd trimester (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.62 [1.10 to 2.39]), compared to those in the third blood Mn level quartile (the category including 18.6 ?g/L). No association of blood Mn level with birth weight was observed among female infants, and blood Mn level was not associated with birth length in either male or female infants. Conclusion: A low blood Mn level during pregnancy or a high blood Mn level during the 3rd trimester was associated with a lower birth weight and increased risk of SGA in male infants, but not in female infants. A low blood Mn level was found to correlate slightly with a small head circumference among infants of both sexes. ? 2019 The Authors",birth size; manganese; pregnancy; sex difference; SGA,"hemoglobin; manganese; manganese; blood; cohort analysis; confidence interval; health impact; manganese; nonlinearity; pregnancy; regression analysis; risk; sex-related difference; womens health; adult; Article; birth size; birth weight; blood; blood sampling; body height; body mass; body weight gain; boy; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; first trimester pregnancy; girl; head circumference; hemoglobin blood level; human; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Japan; limit of detection; major clinical study; male; manganese blood level; maternal blood; obstetric delivery; parameters concerning the fetus, newborn and pregnancy; pregnancy; pregnancy outcome; pregnant woman; prenatal growth; priority journal; small for date infant; birth weight; drug effect; newborn; pregnancy; sex factor; small for date infant; third trimester pregnancy; Japan; Birth Weight; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Small for Gestational Age; Japan; Male; Manganese; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Sex Factors",2-s2.0-85061639835

Some reports have shown that the incidence of postoperative pneumonia is decreased after esophageal surgery by perioperative oral care; however, there exist no data to suggest that a lack of perioperative oral care can be a risk factor for postoperative pneumonia after lung resection. To investigate the association between the preventive effect of oral care and postoperative pneumonia, we conducted a multicenter, retrospective study of lung cancer patients who underwent lung resection. Methods: Between January 2014 and December 2016, a total of 721 patients underwent lung resections at 1 of the 6 hospitals included in our study. Among 721 patients, 280 (38.8%) received perioperative oral care, and the remaining 441 (61.2%) did not receive any such care. Propensity score matching was performed to minimize selection biases associated with the comparison of retrospective data between the oral care and control groups. Results: Of the 721 patients, 54 (7.5%) experienced postoperative pneumonia involving 13 of the 280 patients (4.6%) in the oral care group and 41 of the 441 patients (9.3%) in the control group (P = .02). On propensity score analysis, a significant difference was also found between oral care intervention and incidence of postoperative pneumonia (P = .002). Conclusion: Our results suggest that perioperative oral care is an effective method to decrease the occurrence of postoperative pneumonia in patients who have undergone lung resection. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,aged; Article; cancer patient; controlled study; disease association; female; human; incidence; lung cancer; lung resection; major clinical study; male; mouth hygiene; multicenter study; perioperative period; personal experience; postoperative complication; postoperative pneumonia; priority journal; propensity score; retrospective study; adverse event; clinical trial; lung resection; lung tumor; middle aged; perioperative period; pneumonia; postoperative complication; procedures; risk factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Oral Hygiene; Perioperative Care; Pneumonectomy; Pneumonia; Postoperative Complications; Propensity Score; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85061267474

We investigated the influence of renal dysfunction on virologic efficacy and adverse effects in 189 patients with HCV genotype 2 infection who received combination RBV–DAA regimens. Methods: The incidence of RBV-induced anemia, RBV dose reduction, and virologic efficacy were compared according to baseline renal function as defined by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Results: Patients with renal dysfunction (eGFR = 30–59?mL/min/1.73?m2) had higher rate of RBV dose reduction and more marked decreases in hemoglobin levels. These findings were more pronounced in patients with the ITPA CC genotype, who are more sensitive to RBV-induced anemia. Although there were no statistically significant differences in sustained virologic response (SVR) rates according to renal function overall (P = 0.1650), the SVR rate was significantly lower in patients who required RBV dose reduction than in those who did not (P &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Baseline renal dysfunction could unfavorably affect the outcomes of RBV–DAA in patients with chronic HCV infection due to the increased risk of RBV dose reduction, even in the era of IFN-free DAA regimens. ? 2019 The Japan Society of Hepatology",anemia; chronic hepatitis C; direct-acting antiviral agent; renal dysfunction; ribavirin,alanine aminotransferase; albumin; antivirus agent; aspartate aminotransferase; bilirubin; creatinine; direct acting antiviral agent; hemoglobin; ombitasvir; paritaprevir; ribavirin; ritonavir; sofosbuvir; unclassified drug; virus RNA; aged; anemia; antibody titer; Article; calculation; chronic hepatitis C; creatinine clearance; disease severity assessment; drug dose reduction; drug efficacy; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; follow up; gene frequency; gene mutation; Hepatitis C virus genotype 2; human; hypertension; incidence; kidney dysfunction; kidney function; limit of detection; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; platelet count; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; sustained virologic response; virus load,2-s2.0-85061184074

However, the principal factors that necessitate hospital admission among dementia patients have not been fully elucidated. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the data in the medical and autopsy reports of patients who had been treated at a hospital in Toyohashi, Japan. Each patient had been hospitalized sometime between 2012 and 2016 and underwent a brain autopsy. Dementia and the subtypes of dementia were diagnosed neuropathologically. Information about patients’ general backgrounds, clinical conditions at the time of admission, and the geriatric syndrome symptoms and BPSD before admission was collected; comparisons were then made between patients with and without dementia and among those with the different major subtypes of dementia. Then, the factors relating to hospital admission of dementia patients were comprehensively evaluated by using principle component analysis. Results: Of the 128 eligible patients, 100 (78.1%) had dementia. In the comparison of patients with and without dementia, patients without dementia were younger at both admission (P = 0.034) and death (P = 0.003). Among the patients with dementia with Lewy bodies, delusions had a significantly high prevalence (P = 0.014). Principal component analysis identified nine components (disinhibition, irritability/lability, agitation/aggression, anxiety, delusions, sleep/night-time behaviour disorders, hallucinations, aberrant motor behaviour, and speech impairment) as the principal factors related to hospital admission among dementia patients. Thus, BPSD were identified as principal factors. Conclusions: Compared to other factors, BPSD are more likely to cause dementia patients to be admitted to hospital. The present results indicate that measures should be taken to ameliorate the difficulties associated with caring for patients with BPSD at home. ? 2019 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society",behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia; cause of hospital admission; dementia; geriatric syndrome; principle component analysis,"age; aged; aggression; agitation; Alzheimer disease; anxiety disorder; apathy; Article; autopsy; bedridden patient; constipation; controlled study; daily life activity; death; delusion; dementia; diffuse Lewy body disease; disinhibition; female; frontotemporal dementia; gait disorder; geriatric disorder; hallucination; hospital admission; human; irritability; Japan; major clinical study; male; mental disease; mental instability; motor dysfunction; multiinfarct dementia; observational study; priority journal; progressive supranuclear palsy; retrospective study; sleep disorder; speech disorder; urine incontinence; walking; wheelchair user; antisocial personality disorder; anxiety; autopsy; behavior; brain; delusion; dementia; hospital patient; hospitalization; neuropsychological test; pathology; prevalence; principal component analysis; psychology; restlessness; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anxiety; Autopsy; Behavioral Symptoms; Brain; Delusions; Dementia; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Inpatients; Irritable Mood; Japan; Neuropsychological Tests; Prevalence; Principal Component Analysis; Psychomotor Agitation; Retrospective Studies; Social Behavior Disorders",2-s2.0-85060593302

We attempted to identify the risk factors for urinary stones by statistically analyzing urinary biochemical and inflammation-related factors. Methods: Male participants (age, 20–79?years) who visited Nagoya City University Hospital were divided into three groups: a control group (n = 48) with no history of stones and two stone groups with calcium oxalate stone experience (first-time group, n = 22; recurring group, n = 40). Using 25-?L spot urine samples, we determined the concentrations of 18 candidate urinary proteins, using multiplex analysis on a MagPix? system. Results: In univariate logistic regression models classifying the control and first-time groups, interleukin (IL)-1a and IL-4 were independent factors, with significantly high areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (1.00 and 0.87, respectively, P < 0.01 for both). The multivariate models with IL-4 and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) showed higher areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.93) compared to that for the univariate model with IL-4. In the classification of control, first-time, and recurrence groups, accuracy was the highest for the multinomial logit model with IL-4, GM-CSF, IL-1b, IL-10, and urinary magnesium (concordance rate 82.6%). Conclusions: IL-4, IL-1a, GM-CSF, IL-1b, and IL-10 were identified as urinary inflammation-related factors that could accurately distinguish control individuals from patients with urinary stones. Thus, the combined analysis of urinary biochemical data could provide an index that more clearly evaluates the risk of urinary stone formation. ? 2019, Japanese Society of Nephrology.",Calcium oxalate; Macrophage; Multiplex analysis; Risk markers; Urinary stones,biochemical marker; epidermal growth factor; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 6; magnesium; melanoma growth stimulatory activity factor; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; platelet derived growth factor AA; platelet derived growth factor BB; RANTES; tumor necrosis factor; biological marker; interleukin derivative; accuracy; adult; aged; Article; calcium oxalate stone; controlled study; human; limit of detection; logistic regression analysis; magnesium urine level; major clinical study; male; protein urine level; recurrent disease; risk assessment; statistical model; urine sampling; urolithiasis; case control study; middle aged; urine; urolithiasis; young adult; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Humans; Interleukins; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Urinary Calculi; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85060191144

Methods: These SNPs were determined by allelic discrimination in blood samples of 105 healthy controls and 530 patients with HCC [270 with hepatitis B virus (HBV-HCC), 131 with hepatitis C virus (HCV-HCC), and 129 with non-B, non-C HCC (NBNC-HCC) matched for age and gender]. Results: G allele of PNPLA3 rs738409 variant was significantly higher in NBNC-HCC (49%) compared to healthy controls (32%), HBV-HCC (32%) and HCV-HCC (31%) (P < 0.001). T allele of TM6SF2 rs58542926 was more prevalent in NBNC-HCC (24%) than in healthy controls (8%), HBV-HCC (10%) and HCV-HCC (12%) (P < 0.001). The distribution of NCAN (rs2228603) and MBOAT7 (rs641738) was not different between groups. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, PNPLA3 rs738409 (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.24–3.43; P = 0.005) and TM6SF2 rs58542926 (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.34–3.65; P = 0.002) were independently associated with NBNC-HCC compared to viral-related HCC (VR-HCC). The proportion of patients with NBNC-HCC increased significantly along with the increase of the number of risk alleles. There was no association between these SNPs and overall survival in patients with HCC. Conclusions: These data showed that PNPLA3 and TM6SF2 polymorphisms were independently linked to NBNC-HCC but not HBV- or HCV-HCC in Thai populations. In addition, the risk genotypes might interact with each other through tumor development in patients with NBNC-HCC. ? 2018, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Hepatocellular carcinoma; PNPLA3; Polymorphisms; TM6SF2; Viral hepatitis,alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alcohol; bilirubin; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; allele; Article; bilirubin blood level; body mass; cancer risk; cancer survival; Child Pugh score; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drinking behavior; female; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; genotype; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis C virus; human; liver cell carcinoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oncogene; overall survival; platelet count; pnpla3 gene; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; tm6sf2 gene; tumor volume,2-s2.0-85057781125

A nitinol scoring element–equipped helical balloon catheter (AngioSculpt ? ) has been altered the landscape for treating several vascular diseases. It is not, however, fully elucidated whether AngioSculpt for advanced vascular access stenosis, difficult to expand by conventional balloons, successfully provides bailout angioplasty. Here, we report our cases whose intradialytic venous pressure significantly improved after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty without any serious adverse complications using AngioSculpt. Patients and Methods: Among patients undergoing hemodialysis in Masuko Memorial Hospital, 16 cases with resistant and recurrent vascular access stenosis underwent AngioSculpt (diameter 6 mm, total length 4 cm) angioplasty. We simultaneously measured the average venous pressures during hemodialysis before and after percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Results: The average outflow vessel stenosis rate was 73.0 ± 11.3% before AngioSculpt intervention. Fully enlarged vessels were observed by expanding vessels at maximum pressure of 14 atm in all cases without any complications including vascular ruptures. Their intradialytic venous pressures decreased from 181.8 ± 39.2 mmHg to 150.5 ± 39.3 mmHg (p &lt; 0.0001). Conclusion: AngioSculpt may provide a promising option for treating hemodialysis patients with severely advanced vascular access stenosis, who would otherwise need repeated vascular access surgeries and/or conventional percutaneous transluminal angioplasties. ?

Despite the favorable results of phase 2 clinical trials, many phase 3 clinical trials fail to meet primary endpoints. Therefore, we investigated the causes of failure to meet primary endpoints in phase 3 clinical trials. Methods: We performed a systematic review of phase 3 clinical trials in patients with NSCLC. The results of phase 3 clinical trials collected from the survey were categorized as “negative” (failed to meet the primary endpoint) or “positive” (met the primary endpoint). Results: Of a total of 106 trials collected from this survey, 40 positive trials (38%) and 66 negative trials (62%) were identified. The majority of the primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) (94%). More trials using OS as the primary endpoint were negative (42 of 56 trials), and more trials using PFS as the primary endpoint were positive (24 of 44 trials). The median OS in the control arm in negative trials was significantly longer than the pretrial estimate (P <.001), whereas the median PFS in the control arm in positive trials was relatively consistent with the pretrial estimate. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the selection of the primary endpoint and the pretrial estimate can potentially impact the results of phase 3 clinical trials in patients with NSCLC and are critical success factors when planning phase 3 clinical trials. ?

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used worldwide as first-line therapy for gastroesophageal reflux disease and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug-induced ulcer treatment. Long-term use of PPIs increases the risk of FGP development. We report an extremely rare case of PPI-induced FGPs with hematemesis. A 37-year-old woman taking daily rabeprazole presented to the hospital with a complaint of hematemesis and tarry stools. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) revealed > 20 pedunculated polyps in the gastric body and fundus. Histological examination showed multiple fragments of fundic gland mucosa with dilated glands. Based on these findings and the clinical history, FGPs were diagnosed. Rabeprazole use was discontinued. Repeat EGD performed 9?months later showed a significant decrease in the number and size of the polyps. FGPs are small polyps typically located in the gastric corpus and fundus. They are commonly reported in patients in their 60s and predominantly in females. We conclude that PPI use is a risk factor for the development of FGPs and hematemesis. ? 2018, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD); Fundic gland polyps (FGPs); Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD); Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs),"beta catenin; gastrin; rabeprazole; proton pump inhibitor; adult; Article; case report; clinical article; colonoscopy; computer assisted tomography; drug withdrawal; esophagogastroduodenoscopy; female; gastrin blood level; gastroesophageal reflux; hematemesis; histology; human; human tissue; priority journal; risk factor; stomach fundus gland; stomach gland polyp; stomach hemorrhage; chemically induced; digestive tract endoscopy; hematemesis; pathology; polyp; stomach fundus; stomach tumor; Adult; Endoscopy, Digestive System; Female; Gastric Fundus; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Hematemesis; Humans; Polyps; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Stomach Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85053783225

This approach aims to restore down-regulated miRNAs using synthetic miRNA mimics. However, it remains a critical issue that miRNA mimics are unstable and transient in cells. Here, we first show that miRNA mimics are rapidly degraded by a mechanism different from Tudor-staphylococcal/micrococcal-like nuclease (TSN)-mediated miRNA decay, which degrades endogenous miRNAs, and newly identified 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)/RNase L as key factors responsible for the degradation of miRNA mimics in human cells. Our results suggest that the OAS1 recognizes miRNA mimics and produces 2′-5′-oligoadenylates (2–5A), which leads to the activation of latent endoribonuclease RNase L to degrade miRNA mimics. A small-molecule inhibitor that blocks RNase L can stabilize miRNA mimics. These findings provide a promising method for the stabilization of miRNA mimics, as well as for the efficient miRNA replacement therapy. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Curcumin; miRNA mimics; Oligoadenylate synthetase; RNase L,"2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase 1; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase 2; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase 3; microRNA; ribonuclease L; unclassified drug; 2',5' oligoadenylate synthetase; 2-5A-dependent ribonuclease; microRNA; OAS1 protein, human; ribonuclease; Article; controlled study; down regulation; human; human cell; in vitro study; Northern blotting; oligomerization; priority journal; protein RNA binding; real time polymerase chain reaction; RNA degradation; RNA stability; chemistry; HeLa cell line; metabolism; RNA stability; 2',5'-Oligoadenylate Synthetase; Endoribonucleases; HeLa Cells; Humans; MicroRNAs; RNA Stability",2-s2.0-85061759579

Herein, we present the first case of preservation of this nerve by combining an in-situ preparation technique (ISP; a technique enabling the preparation of neurovascular bundles without contamination by tumor cells) with intensive concurrent neoadjuvant chemo-radiotherapy with hyperthermia (RHC; radio-hyperthermo-chemotherapy). A 62-year-old man presented with a soft tissue mass in the right thigh and was diagnosed with undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma. The tumor arose in the multi-compartment areas of the posterior thigh muscles and was closely intertwined with the sciatic nerve. As preoperative therapy, RHC was performed for surgical down-staging and the tumor partially responded. Afterwards, wide resection of the tumor with preservation of the sciatic nerve using ISP was performed. Following the surgery, there has not been recurrence in the affected site and the functional outcomes of the lower extremity achieved 80% in the Musculoskeletal Tumor Society score. The patient is still alive with disease five years postoperatively. This is the first case in which ISP and RHC procedures were combined for the preservation of the neurovascular structure.

CMCdG’s in vitro activity was determined using quantitative PCR and Southern blotting assays, and its cytotoxicity was determined with a 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay, while its in vivo activity and safety were determined in human liver-chimeric mice infected with wild-type HBV genotype Ce (HBVWTCe) and an entecavir (ETV)-resistant HBV variant containing the amino acid substitutions L180M, S202G, and M204V (HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V). CMCdG potently inhibited HBV production in HepG2.2.15 cells (50% inhibitory concentration [IC50], 30 nM) and HBVWTCe plasmid-transfected Huh7 cells (IC50, 206nM) and efficiently suppressed ETV-resistant HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V (IC50, 2,657 nM), while it showed no or little cytotoxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration, 500 M in most hepatocytic cells examined). Two-week peroral administration of CMCdG (1 mg/kg of body weight/day once a day [q.d.]) to HBVWTCe-infected human liver-chimeric mice reduced the level of viremia by 2 logs. CMCdG also reduced the level of HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V viremia by 1 log in HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V-infected human liver-chimeric mice, while ETV (1 mg/ kg/day q.d.) completely failed to reduce the viremia. None of the CMCdG-treated mice had significant drug-related changes in body weights or serum human albumin levels. Structural analyses using homology modeling, semiempirical quantum methods, and molecular dynamics revealed that although ETV triphosphate (TP) forms good van der Waals contacts with L180 and M204 of HBVWTCe reverse transcriptase (RT), its contacts with the M180 substitution are totally lost in the HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V RT complex. However, CMCdG-TP retains good contacts with both the HBVWTCe RT and HBVETV-RL180M/S202G/M204V RT complexes.

She showed severe developmental delay, congenital sensorineural hearing loss and seizures, but the combination of a high dose phenobarbital and potassium bromide was very effective for the seizures. Sanger sequencing revealed that her mother was a heterozygous carrier of the TBC1D24 variant, but her father showed only wild-type alleles. Homozygosity mapping analysis using exome data showed loss of the heterozygosity region at 16p13.3–p13.13 encompassing TBC1D24. Genotyping analysis using rare variants within loss of the heterozygosity region indicated that the patient has a homozygous haplotype inherited from her mother, indicating maternal segmental uniparental isodisomy (UPiD).

Methods: In this multicenter retrospective study, we compared effectiveness and safety of SMX/TMP for the treatment of PCP among patients divided into three groups according to the initial dosage of SMX/TMP: the low, ?10 mg/kg/day; the intermediate, 10–15 mg/kg/day; and the high and conventional, 15–20 mg/kg/day for TMP dose. Results: Eighty-one patients, including 22, 30, and 29 patients in the low-, the intermediate- and the high-dose group could be analyzed and the 30-day survival rate were 100%, 93.3%, and 96.7%, respectively (P = 0.28). There were significant dose-dependent increasing trends of severe adverse drug reactions (ADRs) for SMX/TMP that were graded as ?3 according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. When stratified by presence of severe hypoxemia defined by alveolar-arterial O2 gradient ?45 mmHg, the 30-day survival and treatment modification rate were similar among the three groups, but frequency of severe ADRs were significantly decreased in the low-dose group. The low-dose group was independently and negatively associated with treatment modification within 14 days and severe ADRs. Conclusions: Lower dose SMX/TMP therapy with ?10 mg/kg/day for TMP was as effective as higher dose therapy for the treatment of PCP and associated with lower rates of treatment modification and severe ADRs in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases. ? 2018 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases",Adverse drug reactions; Pneumocystis pneumonia; Sulfamethoxazole; Systemic rheumatic diseases; Trimethoprim,"alanine aminotransferase; aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; atovaquone; cotrimoxazole; creatinine; methylprednisolone; pentamidine; antiinfective agent; cotrimoxazole; adult; adult onset Still disease; aged; anemia; Article; bone marrow suppression; connective tissue disease; controlled study; creatinine blood level; dermatomyositis; disease severity; dose response; drug dose comparison; drug dose reduction; drug dose regimen; drug efficacy; drug megadose; erythema multiforme; female; fever; giant cell arteritis; human; hyperkalemia; hypertransaminasemia; hyponatremia; hypoxemia; low drug dose; lung alveolus oxygen tension; lymphatic system disease; major clinical study; male; microscopic polyangiitis; middle aged; nausea; neutrophil count; oxygen therapy; platelet count; Pneumocystis pneumonia; polymyositis; retrospective study; rheumatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis; side effect; Sjoegren syndrome; survival rate; survival time; systemic disease; systemic lupus erythematosus; systemic vasculitis; treatment duration; treatment outcome; clinical trial; complication; immunology; immunosuppressive treatment; isolation and purification; mortality; multicenter study; opportunistic infection; Pneumocystis carinii; Pneumocystis pneumonia; procedures; rheumatic disease; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Humans; Immunosuppression; Male; Middle Aged; Opportunistic Infections; Pneumocystis carinii; Pneumonia, Pneumocystis; Retrospective Studies; Rheumatic Diseases; Survival Rate; Treatment Outcome; Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination",2-s2.0-85059766255

A patient presented with high-output HF and significant extra-cardiac shunt flow. Although the size and shape of the patient's left ventricle suggested dilated cardiomyopathy, considerable origins were not identified except for a high-flow fistula between the right subclavian artery and right internal jugular vein. Right heart catheter examination revealed inappropriately high cardiac output. Left-to-right shunt ratio was calculated at 40.3% from an oximetry run, under the assumption that the left anonymous vein which was not contaminated with any shunt flow could be substituted for venous return from the upper body. We could determine the indication of fistula closure according to the estimated high left-to-right shunt ratio, reducing cardiac output by 42.7% which was similar to the pre-estimated left-to-right shunt ratio. Two months later, the patient's serum B-type natriuretic peptide level and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameters were decreased. The proposed method to estimate the left-to-right shunt ratio was useful in determining the indication for fistula closure in a patient with HF and a significant shunt fistula. <Learning objective: A significant extracardiac left-to-right shunt more than 30–35% could cause heart failure with left ventricular dilatation similar to dilated cardiomyopathy. One can decide fistula closure with the finding of left-to-right shunt ratio calculated using a transcatheter oximetry run. It is mandatory that the venous oxygen saturation at the upper stream of fistula is determined precisely without the contamination of arterial blood.

An inverse probability of treatment-weighted Poisson regression analysis was performed, and prevalence rate ratios were computed for social participation and functional capacity according to respondents’ use of the center. Results showed that using the center regularly facilitated social participation, contributing to the maintenance of living functions. Regular users’ social participation was promoted through opportunities in sports and volunteer organizations. Their living functions were maintained through instrumental self-maintenance and intellectual activity. Community centers evidently enable beneficial gatherings of older people, encourage social participation, and help to maintain higher level activities of daily living.

Methods: A total of 1029 Japanese CHC patients with the following inclusion criteria were enrolled: (i) achieved SVR by IFN-free therapy, (ii) followed up at least 1?year from the end of treatment (EOT) (median 104?weeks), (iii) no history of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by 1?year from the EOT. Results: Nineteen patients developed HCC (HCC group) and 1010 did not (non-HCC group). The proportion of rs17047200 AT/TT was significantly higher in the HCC group than the non-HCC group (47.4% vs. 20.1%, P = 0.008). Multivariate analysis showed that higher levels of α-fetoprotein, FIB-4 and rs17047200 AT/TT were independent risk factors for developing HCC (HR = 3.22, P = 0.021 for α-fetoprotein > 4.6?ng/ml; HR = 3.89, P = 0.036 for FIB-4 > 2.67; HR = 2.80, P = 0.026 for rs17047200 AT/TT). Cumulative incidence of HCC was significantly higher in patients with rs17047200 AT/TT than in those with AA (P = 0.006). Comparing clinical characteristics according to the TLL1 genotypes, patients with rs17047200 AT/TT had significantly lower platelet counts and higher levels of FIB-4 than those with AA (P = 0.011 and 0.032, respectively).

Methods: Sixty eyes of 30 patients (27 eyes with branch [b]RVO, 3 with central RVO, and 30 fellow eyes) were retrospectively reviewed. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography (OCTA), and microperimetry were performed simultaneously to measure retinal thickness and sensitivity. The presence of ME or MA was also assessed using OCT and fluorescein angiography. Results: The mean retinal sensitivity in the nonperfused areas (NPAs) deteriorated, and this was significantly (r -0.379, p 0.0391) and inversely correlated with duration from disease onset. ME and MA were unlikely to be observed around the area where the retinal sensitivity decreased. In the NPAs, the mean retinal thickness of the superficial capillary plexus (SCP) (p 0.0001), deep capillary plexus (DCP) (p 0.0323), and outer retina (p 0.0008) were significantly thinner than those in the fellow eyes, respectively. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the thicknesses of the DCP (?: 0.3107, p = 0.0007) and outer retina (?: 0.3482, p = 0.0001) were the independent correlative factors of the retinal sensitivity, but that SCP thickness was not. Conclusion: Deep retinal thinning in NPAs was correlated significantly with a decreased retinal sensitivity, which might be a negative predictor of ME and MA in eyes with RVO. ? 2018 S.

The predictive power of a model of parenting stress was examined using multiple regression analysis (stepwise), with parenting stress (PSI-SF) as the dependent variable, and children's demographics, including characteristics of AD; parents’ demographics; QoL of families of children with AD (JCMV-CADIS); and family functioning (FAI) as independent variables. We handled missing values using a multiple imputation method. Results: The pooled coefficients obtained from the multiple regression analysis after multiple imputation indicated that “family cohesion,” “family system flexibility,” “emotions related to social factors” and “occupation of mother” determined parenting stress. Lower family cohesion and family system flexibility predicted higher parenting stress. The high impact of “emotions related to social factors” on families’ QoL predicted higher parenting stress. Full-time work by mothers predicted lower parenting stress. Conclusions: The current results reveal that “family cohesion,” “family system flexibility,” “emotions related to social factors” and “full-time work by mothers” predicted parenting stress of mothers who had children with AD. ? 2018 Japanese Society of Allergology",Atopic dermatitis; Family; Multiple imputation; Multiple regression; Stress,"Article; asthma; atopic dermatitis; child; clinical feature; demography; disease severity; emotion; family; family assessment; Family Assessment Inventory; family functioning; female; food allergy; full time employment; human; Japanese Culturally Modified version of Childhood Atopic Dermatitis Impact Scale; major clinical study; male; occupation; parental stress; Parenting Stress Index Short Form; priority journal; quality of life; skin disease assessment; social aspect; social status; atopic dermatitis; child parent relation; family relation; mental stress; mother; preschool child; psychology; Child; Child, Preschool; Dermatitis, Atopic; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Male; Mothers; Parenting; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-85053055562

Wernicke encephalopathy (WE) is a neuropsychiatric disorder caused by thiamine deficiency. It is recognized in various stages of the cancer trajectory but has not previously been recognized during nivolumab treatment. Method. From a series of WE patients with cancer, we report a lung cancer patient who developed WE during treatment with nivolumab. Result. A 78-year-old woman with lung cancer was referred to our psycho-oncology clinic because of depressed mood. Psychiatric examination revealed disorientation to time, date, and place, which had not been recognized 1 month previously. Her symptoms fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for delirium. No laboratory findings or drugs explaining her delirium were identified. WE was suspected as she experienced a loss of appetite lasting 4 weeks. This diagnosis was supported by abnormal serum thiamine and the disappearance of delirium after intravenous thiamine administration. Significance of results. We found WE in an advanced lung cancer patient receiving treatment with nivolumab. Further study revealed the association between nivolumab and thiamine deficiency. Oncologists should consider thiamine deficiency when a patient experiences a loss of appetite of more than 2 weeks regardless of the presence or absence of delirium. Copyright ?

Previously, we reported that App NL-G-F mice, which harbor three familial AD mutations (Swedish, Beyreuther/Iberian, and Arctic) exhibited emotional alterations before the onset of definitive cognitive deficits. To determine whether these mice exhibit deficits in learning and memory at more advanced ages, we compared the Morris water maze performance of App NL-G-F and App NL mice, which harbor only the Swedish mutation, with that of wild-type (WT) C57BL/6J mice at the age of 24 months. To correlate cognitive deficits and neuroinflammation, we also examined Aβ plaque formation and reactive gliosis in these mice. Results: In the Morris water maze, a spatial task, 24-month-old App NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice exhibited significantly poorer spatial learning than WT mice during the hidden training sessions, but similarly to WT mice during the visible training sessions. Not surprisingly, App NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice also exhibited spatial memory deficits both 1 and 7 days after the last training session. By contrast, 24-month-old App NL/NL mice had intact spatial learning and memory relative to WT mice. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed that 24-month-old App NL-G-F/NL-G-F mice developed massive Aβ plaques and reactive gliosis (microgliosis and astrocytosis) throughout the brain, including the cortex and hippocampus. By contrast, we observed no detectable brain pathology in App NL/NL mice despite overproduction of human Aβ40 and Aβ42 in their brains. Conclusions: Aβ plaque formation, followed by sustained neuroinflammation, is necessary for the induction of definitive cognitive deficits in App-KI mouse models of AD. Our data also indicate that introduction of the Swedish mutation alone in endogenous APP is not sufficient to produce either AD-related brain pathology or cognitive deficits in mice. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid precursor protein; Cognitive deficits; Knock-in mouse model; Neuroinflammation,"amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); amyloid precursor protein; APP protein, human; peptide fragment; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; astrocytosis; cognitive defect; controlled study; female; gliosis; immunohistochemistry; male; mental task; Morris water maze test; mouse; mouse model; nervous system inflammation; neuropathology; nonhuman; spatial behavior; spatial learning; spatial memory; task performance; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; animal; brain; C57BL mouse; cognitive defect; disease model; gene knock-in; genetics; gliosis; human; inflammation; maze test; metabolism; pathology; physiology; psychology; transgenic mouse; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Animals; Brain; Cognitive Dysfunction; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Knock-In Techniques; Gliosis; Humans; Inflammation; Male; Maze Learning; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Peptide Fragments; Plaque, Amyloid; Spatial Memory",2-s2.0-85063222489

The ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter / multidrug resistance protein (MRP) ABCC10/MRP7, involved in transporting taxanes, has been associated with resistance to these agents. Since genetic variation in drug transporters may affect clinical outcomes, we examined whether polymorphism of ABCC10 could affect clinical responses to docetaxel. Methods: Using 18 NSCLC cell lines and CRISPR-based genome-edited HeLa cells, we analyzed whether genetic variants of ABCC10 (rs2125739, rs9349256) affected cytotoxicity to docetaxel. Subsequently, we analyzed genetic variants [ABCC10 (rs2125739), ABCB1 (C1236T, C3435T, G2677 T/A), ABCC2 (rs12762549), and SLCO1B3 (rs11045585)] in 69 blood samples of NSCLC patients treated with docetaxel monotherapy. Clinical outcomes were evaluated between genotype groups. Results: In the cell lines, only one genetic variant (rs2125739) was significantly associated with docetaxel cytotoxicity, and this was confirmed in the genome-edited cell line. In the 69 NSCLC patients, there were no significant differences related to rs2125739 genotype in terms of RR, PFS, or OS. However, this SNP was associated with grade 3/4 neutropenia (T/C group 60% vs. T/T group 87%; P = 0.028). Furthermore, no patient with a T/C genotype experienced febrile neutropenia. Conclusions: Our results indicate that genetic variation in the ABCC10 gene is associated with neutropenia for docetaxel treatment. ? 2019 The Author(s).",ABC transporter; Docetaxel; Neutropenia; Single nucleotide polymorphism,"docetaxel; multidrug resistance associated protein 2; multidrug resistance associated protein 7; multidrug resistance protein 1; solute carrier organic anion transporter 1B3; ABCC10 protein, human; antineoplastic agent; docetaxel; multidrug resistance associated protein; ABCB1 gene; ABCC10 gene; ABCC2 gene; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; female; genetic variation; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; Japanese (people); lung cancer; lung non-small cell carcinoma cell line; major clinical study; male; monotherapy; neutropenia; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; progression free survival; single nucleotide polymorphism; SLCO1B3 gene; chemically induced; drug resistance; genetics; Japan; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; neutropenia; tumor cell line; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Cell Line, Tumor; Docetaxel; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Female; Humans; Japan; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Multidrug Resistance-Associated Proteins; Neutropenia; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-85063156569

In 2011, Japan experienced the Great East Japan Earthquake and the nuclear accidents at Fukushima. However, a nationwide study of their effects has not been conducted yet. Methods and Results: We used data covering the period between 2007 and 2014 from the annual surveys conducted by the Japanese Association for Thoracic Surgery, which included almost all of the operations pertaining to 46 types of CHDs in Japan. CHDs were divided into 2 groups based on complexity, the time of occurrence during heart development, and age at operation. We estimated the change in the number of the operations per 100?000 live births between pre- and postdisaster using a negative binomial generalized linear mixed model. Overall, a significant 14.2% (95% CI, 9.3–19.4) increase in the number of operations for complex CHDs in neonates and infants per 100?000 live births was found, whereas those performed for patients of 1 to 17?years old showed no significant change during the study period. Conclusions: The number of operations for complex CHDs in neonates and infants in Japan significantly increased after the massive disaster, and its level was maintained thereafter. The number of operations for complex CHD was not equal but closely correlated to the live birth prevalence of complex CHDs. Therefore, some meaningful increase in the live birth prevalence can be assumed; however, the precise cause of the increase is unknown. ? 2019 The Authors.

The marker compounds of SF for quality control are lignans, such as schizandrin (Sz) and gomisin?A (GmA). Kampo formulation containing SF is usually prepared as decoctions in the dosage form of whole crude drug (W), as its size is small enough to measure using a spoon. However, in some traditional books, it has been described that SF must be used in the dosage form of crushed or cut pieces (Cr). In this study, we evaluated the transferring ratio of lignans from SF to the decoction, and the stability and taste of the decoctions of shoseiryuto (SST) and ninjin’yoeito (NYT) using each dosage form, i.e., Cr and W, of SF. The transferring ratio of Sz and GmA was significantly higher in the decoction prepared with the Cr form than that prepared using the W form in both SST and NYT. The concentration of Sz and GmA in the decoctions was stable when maintained at 4?°C for 35 days. The taste of SST decoction prepared using the Cr form was more acidic, harsher, and bitterer than SST decoction prepared using the W form, and the taste of NYT decoction prepared using the Cr form was harsher than NYT decoction prepared using the W form. In conclusion, when SF is used in Kampo prescription, crushing the fruits and seeds can increase its effectiveness. ? 2018, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",Decoction; Gomisin?A; Kampo medicine; Schisandra fruit; Schizandrin,"gomisin A; lignan derivative; schizandrin; 1,3 dioxolane derivative; cyclooctane derivative; gomisin A; herbaceous agent; lignan; polycyclic hydrocarbon; ren-shen-yang-rong-tang; schizandrin; sho-seiryu-to; Article; clinical effectiveness; drug activity; drug stability; fruit; high performance liquid chromatography; Kampo medicine; nonhuman; pericarp; plant root; purification; quality control; retention time; rhizome; Schisandra chinensis; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; adult; chemistry; female; fruit; human; Kampo medicine; male; Schisandra; taste; young adult; Adult; Cyclooctanes; Dioxoles; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Female; Fruit; Humans; Lignans; Male; Medicine, Kampo; Polycyclic Compounds; Schisandra; Taste; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85058263668

This study aimed to provide an overview of the positive and negative impacts of schizophrenia on family caregivers. Methods: From April to June 2017, two investigators conducted a systematic review and meta-summary of studies obtained from five electronic databases and the footnotes and citations of eligible studies. Qualitative studies that explored the experiences of family caregivers of individuals with schizophrenia were included. Study findings published between 1993 and 2017 were extracted and synthesised using narrative and summative approaches. Results: After the removal of duplicates, independent reviewers screened 864 records. Subsequently, 46 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and 23 papers were included in the synthesis. Negative impacts identified were traumatic experiences, loss of expectation of life and health, lack of personal and social resources, uncertainty and unpredictability, family disruption, conflict in interpersonal relationships, difficulty in understanding, and stigma and heredity. Meanwhile, the positive impacts identified were family solidarity, admiration, affirmation, affection, compassion, learning knowledge and skills, self-confidence, personal growth, and appreciation. Conclusions: Analysis of the studies suggested that family members of individuals with schizophrenia face a series of traumatic situations during the course of the illness. Their subsequent experiences can be conceptualised as a continuous circle of caregiving, in which the positive impacts can be centrally positioned within the negative impacts. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Caregiver benefits; Caregiver burden; Caregiving process; Mandala; Qualitative synthesis,caregiver; empathy; family; human; psychology; schizophrenia; social stigma; Caregivers; Empathy; Family; Humans; Schizophrenia; Social Stigma,2-s2.0-85063627964

Over half a century has now passed since this recommendation; Japan is witnessing an aging of the population (it is estimated that over 65-year-olds made up 27.7% of the population in 2017) and a decline in the birth rate (total fertility rate 1.43 births per woman in 2017) at a rate that is unparalleled in the world; Japan is faced with a “super-aging” society with low birth rate. In 2017, the Society passed a resolution to encourage all scientists to engage in academic researches to address the issue of the declining birth rate that Japan is currently facing. In this commentary, the Society hereby declares that the entire text of the 1952 proposal is revoked and the ideas relating to eugenics is rejected. Since the Society has set up a working group on the issue in 2016, there have been three symposiums, and working group committee members began publishing a series of articles in the Society’s Japanese language journal. This commentary primarily provides an overview of the findings from the published articles, which will form the scientific basis for the Society’s declaration. The areas we covered here included the following: (1) improving the social and work environment to balance between the personal and professional life; (2) proactive education on reproductive health; (3) children’s health begins with nutritional management in women of reproductive age; (4) workplace environment and occupational health; (5) workplace measures to counter the declining birth rate; (6) research into the effect of environmental chemicals on sexual maturity, reproductive function, and the children of next generation; and (7) comprehensive research into the relationship among contemporary society, parental stress, and healthy child-rearing.

Methods: To remove caseins, which are major milk proteins consisting more than 80% of milk protein (35% in human breast milk) and hamper isolation and purification of exosomes, hydrochloride (HCl) was added to milk for isoelectric precipitation (IP). The effects of acidification on morphological features, particle size distribution, surface charge, and exosome surface proteins were analyzed by electron microscopy, tunable resistive pulse sensing (TRPS), and Western blot (WB) analysis, respectively. Results: Electron microscopy showed that some of the exosomes isolated using IP had rough surfaces; most exosomes were successfully isolated without breakage, and their morphological features were similar to those of exosomes isolated by UC. TRPS showed that their surface charge and peaks (mode) for particle size distribution did not significantly differ between both methods. WB analysis using antibodies against the exosome surface marker proteins–milk fat globule-epidermal growth factor 8 (MFG-E8) and CD63–revealed that the structures of exosome surface proteins were not affected by adding HCl. Conclusions: IP can be used to remove caseins to reduce operation time. This method will be useful for efficient isolation and purification of bovine milk exosomes and contribute to progression of research on health management of dairy cattle and drug delivery systems in human medicine, which require large amounts of milk exosomes. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Bovine milk exosomes; casein; isoelectric precipitation; isolation; ultracentrifugation,"casein; CD63 antigen; chloride; epidermal growth factor; milk fat globule epidermal growth factor 8; unclassified drug; biological marker; membrane antigen; milk protein; acidification; Article; cow milk; electron microscopy; exosome; isolation; particle size; precipitation; protein structure; raw milk; surface charge; ultracentrifugation; Western blotting; animal; bovine; chemistry; exosome; milk; procedures; Animals; Antigens, Surface; Biomarkers; Caseins; Cattle; Exosomes; Milk; Milk Proteins; Particle Size; Tetraspanin 30; Ultracentrifugation",2-s2.0-85056154284

However, the reported frequency of pneumonia as a cause of death in patients with dementia varies, the reason for which has not been fully elucidated. Methods We conducted a systematic search in PubMed and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (inception to December 2016). Two authors independently determined the suitability of studies and potential bias and extracted the data. The primary outcome was frequency of pneumonia-associated death in patients with dementia. Stratified subgroup analysis was conducted among studies grouped according to type of mortality cause (immediate or underlying), information source of mortality cause (autopsy or death certificate), and study setting (clinic, hospital, or nursing home). Results We included 7 studies reporting the cause of death among patients with dementia and 12 studies comparing the cause of death among patients with and without dementia. The frequency of pneumonia-associated death among 19 eligible studies was 29.69% (95% confidence interval [CI], 25.86–33.53). Those frequencies differed according to whether the source for information about cause of death was an autopsy confirmation (49.98%; 95% CI, 43.75–56.71) or death certificate (19.65%; 95% CI, 15.48–23.83) and according to whether the type of mortality cause was an indirect cause of death (13.96%; 95% CI, 9.42–18.51) or direct cause of death (44.45%; 95% CI, 29.81–50.10). The risk of pneumonia-associated death in patients with dementia was twice as high as among those without dementia (odds ratio, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.63–2.83; p < 0.001). Conclusion The various frequencies of pneumonia-associated death in patients with dementia were associated with the information source, type of mortality cause, and study setting.

However, approximately one in two cooled infants still die or develop permanent neurological impairments. Further understanding of variables associated with the effectiveness of cooling is important to improve the therapeutic regimen. To identify clinical factors associated with short-term outcomes of cooled infants, clinical data of 509 cooled infants registered to the Baby Cooling Registry of Japan between 2012 and 2014 were evaluated. Independent variables of death during the initial hospitalization and survival discharge from the cooling hospital at ?28 days of life were assessed. Death was associated with higher Thompson scores at admission (p < 0.001); higher heart rates after 3-72 hours of cooling (p < 0.001); and higher body temperature after 24 hours of cooling (p = 0.002). Survival discharge was associated with higher 10 minutes Apgar scores (p < 0.001); higher blood pH and base excess (both p < 0.001); lower Thompson scores (at admission and after 24 hours of cooling; both p < 0.001); lower heart rates at initiating cooling (p = 0.003) and after 24 hours of cooling (p < 0.001) and lower average values after 3-72 hours of cooling (p < 0.001); higher body temperature at admission (p < 0.001); and lower body temperature after 24 hours and lower mean values after 3-72 hours of cooling (both p < 0.001). Survival discharge was best explained by higher blood pH (p < 0.05), higher body temperature at admission (p < 0.01), and lower body temperature and heart rate after 24 hours of cooling (p < 0.01 and <0.001, respectively). Lower heart rate, higher body temperature at admission, and lower body temperature during cooling were associated with favorable short-term outcomes. ?

It has recently been reported that abnormalities in aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase (ARS) genes are linked to various unique leukodystrophies and leukoencephalopathies. Aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase proteins are fundamentally known as the first enzymes of translation, catalysing the conjugation of amino acids to cognate tRNAs for protein synthesis. It is known that certain aminoacyl t-RNA synthetase have multiple non-canonical roles in both transcription and translation, and their disruption results in varied and complicated phenotypes. We clinically and genetically studied seven patients (six male and one female; aged 2 to 12 years) from five unrelated families who all showed the same phenotypes of severe developmental delay or arrest (7/7), hypotonia (6/7), deafness (7/7) and inability to speak (6/7). The subjects further developed intractable epilepsy (7/7) and nystagmus (6/6) with increasing age. They demonstrated characteristic laboratory data, including increased lactate and/or pyruvate levels (7/7), and imaging findings (7/7), including calcification and abnormal signals in the white matter and pathological involvement (2/2) of the corticospinal tracts. Through whole-exome sequencing, we discovered genetic abnormalities in lysyl-tRNA synthetase (KARS). All patients harboured the variant [c.1786C>T, p.Leu596Phe] KARS isoform 1 ([c.1702C>T, p.Leu568Phe] of KARS isoform 2) either in the homozygous state or compound heterozygous state with the following KARS variants, [c.879+1G>A; c.1786C>T, p.Glu252-Glu293del; p.Leu596Phe] ([c.795+1G>A; c.1702C>T, p.Glu224-Glu255del; p.Leu568Phe]) and [c.650G>A; c.1786C>T, p.Gly217Asp; p.Leu596Phe] ([c.566G>A; c.1702C>T, p.Gly189Asp; p.Leu568Phe]). Moreover, similarly disrupted lysyl-tRNA synthetase (LysRS) proteins showed reduced enzymatic activities and abnormal CNSs in Xenopus embryos. Additionally, LysRS acts as a non-canonical inducer of the immune response and has transcriptional activity. We speculated that the complex functions of the abnormal LysRS proteins led to the severe phenotypes in our patients. These KARS pathological variants are novel, including the variant [c.1786C>T; p.Leu596Phe] (c.1702C>T; p.Leu568Phe) shared by all patients in the homozygous or compound-heterozygous state. This common position may play an important role in the development of severe progressive leukodystrophy. Further research is warranted to further elucidate this relationship and to investigate how specific mutated LysRS proteins function to understand the broad spectrum of KARS-related diseases. ?

We conducted a randomized controlled trial to determine whether a disease management program intervention could improve risk factor profiles and, thus, reduce the recurrence of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. Methods - This study is a prospective randomized, open-label, parallel group study involving outpatients with a history of stroke. Between September 2010 and November 2012, we enrolled patients aged between 40 and 80 years who experienced their last ischemic stroke event or transient ischemic attack within 1 year. After stratifying by the ischemic stroke subtype, 321 subjects (67.5±8.5 years, 95 female) were randomly assigned to either the disease management program intervention group (n=156) or the usual care group (n=165). The primary end point of this study was the difference in the Framingham risk score (general cardiovascular disease 10-year risk) from baseline. The secondary end points of this study included stroke recurrence, onset of cardiovascular disease, all-cause mortality, and all vascular events. Results - Regarding the primary end point, there was no significant difference in the changes in the Framingham risk score at any follow-up time between the groups. The incidence of stroke recurrence tended to be lower in the disease management program intervention group, although no significant difference was found (hazard ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.19-1.29). Conclusions - We were unable to demonstrate a clear benefit of disease management program intervention. ? 2019 American Heart Association, Inc.",Disease management; Recurrence; Risk factors; Stroke,"anticoagulant agent; antidiabetic agent; antihypertensive agent; antilipemic agent; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; brain ischemia; cardiovascular risk; caregiver; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; female; follow up; Framingham risk score; general practitioner; human; major clinical study; male; outpatient; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; risk factor; self care; transient ischemic attack; bioassay; brain ischemia; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; complication; disease management; middle aged; mortality; secondary prevention; transient ischemic attack; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain Ischemia; Cardiovascular Diseases; Disease Management; Endpoint Determination; Female; Humans; Ischemic Attack, Transient; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Risk Factors; Secondary Prevention; Stroke",2-s2.0-85062192965

The purpose of this study is to determine the characteristic findings of contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) of the neck in patients with Kawasaki disease (KD) and to develop a diagnostic scoring system to facilitate the diagnosis of KD versus other causes of fever and cervical lymphadenopathy. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Two blinded radiologists evaluated CECT images of 37 patients with KD and 92 patients without KD who had febrile cervical lymphadenopathy, first independently and then in consensus. Significant findings in CECT images were evaluated through cervical edema and lymph node scores. CT attenuation of the nodal low-attenuation area and its ratio to the CT attenuation of the trapezius muscle were measured. On the basis of these indexes, a diagnostic scoring system was developed to differentiate between patients with and without KD. Its diagnostic performance was determined using ROC curve analysis. RESULTS. Retropharyngeal edema, lateral cervical edema, nasopharyngeal wall edema, level IIA lymphadenopathy, and retropharyngeal lymphadenopathy were more common in patients with KD than in patients without KD (p < 0.001, < 0.001, < 0.001, 0.003, and 0.028, respectively). Level VB lymphadenopathy was more common in patients without KD (p = 0.013), and the presence of nodal low-attenuation areas with lower attenuation indexes (attenuation of nodal low-attenuation area ? 50 HU, or ratio of attenuation of nodal low-attenuation area to trapezius muscle attenuation ? 0.7) was specific to patients without KD. In cases of higher attenuation indexes and cervical edema and lymph node scores of 4 or higher, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the diagnostic scoring system were 86% (32/37), 86% (79/92), and 86% (111/129), respectively, for diagnosing KD. CONCLUSION. The proposed diagnostic scoring system was useful in differentiating between patients with and without KD. ?

However, in a recent population-based study, 52/89 (58.4%) of CP had no prior episodes of AP. In a large clinic-based CP cohort, we aimed to determine the incidence and timing of prior AP in patients diagnosed with CP. Methods: We retrospectively identified 499 consecutive patients with classic CP diagnosed at our institution from January 2013 through December 2015. We abstracted their demographic and clinical data, especially regarding prior AP. Results: We identified 3 cohorts: 1) CP with no AP (n = 231 [46.3%]), 2) AP before CP (n = 250 [50.1%]), and 3) AP after CP (n = 18 [3.6%]). At CP diagnosis, 249 patients (49.9%) had no prior AP. Compared with the “CP preceded by AP” cohort, the “CP without AP”’ cohort was older (59.2 ± 13.9 vs 48.6 ± 15.7 years; P <.001), had a higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus (30.3% vs 12.4%; P <.001), reported less pain (52.8% vs 87.6%; P <.001), and had a lower rate of endoscopic interventions (16.0% vs 39.2%; P <.001). In the “CP preceded by AP” cohort, 117 (46.8%) had a single episode of AP and 133 (53.2%) had RAP. Conclusion: Nearly half the patients with classic CP did not have prior AP. Only a quarter of patients had CP that could potentially have evolved from prior RAP. Development of CP may be attributable to an altogether different pathogenesis (a non-SAPE pathway) for a considerable proportion of patients. ? 2019 IAP and EPC",Acute pancreatitis; Chronic pancreatitis; Recurrent acute pancreatitis; Sentinel acute pancreatitis event,"acute pancreatitis; adult; alcoholism; Article; body weight loss; chronic pancreatitis; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; diabetes mellitus; diarrhea; disease association; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; endoscopic ultrasonography; exocrine pancreatic insufficiency; female; follow up; human; idiopathic disease; incidence; jaundice; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pain; pancreas function test; pancreas surgery; pathogenesis; prevalence; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; smoking; symptom; aged; chronic pancreatitis; pathology; risk factor; Adult; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85061624869

Approximately 250 mL of adipose tissue was harvested using a syringe attached to the cannula. Postoperative complications were recorded and graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Results: Average liposuction time was 57.4 min. No major complications were observed. However, there were some minor complications: bruising, numbness, contour irregularities, firmness, and scarring. These complications were CTCAE Grade 1 in all cases. The complications, except for the scarring, became unnoticeable within 6 months in all cases. Conclusion: Liposuction takes time and has some minor donor-site complications for stem cell therapy in aged male stress urinary incontinence patients. ? 2019 The Authors",Aged patients; Donor-site complications; Liposuction; Male; Stress urinary incontinence,hemoglobin; adipose tissue; adipose tissue cell; aged; Article; autologous adipose derived regenerative cell; autologous stem cell transplantation; bacterial infection; body contouring; clinical article; disease severity; donor site complication; follow up; hemoglobin blood level; human; hypertrophic scar; liposuction; lung embolism; male; operation duration; paresthesia; postoperative complication; remission; scoring system; skin bruising; stress incontinence; subcutaneous hemorrhage; surgical risk; very elderly,2-s2.0-85060869661

Long-term (3-year) efficacy and safety of secukinumab in Japanese patients with moderate to severe psoriasis were evaluated in an extension study of a large phase 3 global study (SCULPTURE). In the core study, 52 Japanese patients with 75% improvement of Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI-75) response at week 12 were re-randomized to a fixed interval (FI; every 4?weeks) schedule and retreatment as needed (RAN), in which patients received placebo until start of relapse, at which time secukinumab was reinitiated. Fifty Japanese patients completed the 52-week core study, and 47 patients entered the extension study with the same double-blind regimens up to week 152. All patients in the secukinumab 300?mg FI and seven patients in 150?mg FI groups completed 3?years of treatment. PASI-90 and -100 at the end of year 3 were achieved in 69.2% and 53.8%, respectively, in 300?mg FI and 42.9% and 42.9%, respectively, in 150?mg FI, indicating high sustained response in 300?mg FI. Mean absolute PASI was continually low in 300?mg FI and numerically higher in 150?mg FI. Dermatology Life Quality Index of 0/1 was maintained by approximately two-thirds of 300?mg FI patients, and all EuroQoL 5-Dimension Health Questionnaire domain measures were also improved. FI dosing was consistently more efficacious than RAN. The safety profile of secukinumab remained favorable, with no new safety concerns identified. ? 2019 The Authors.

Methods: This 24-week, single-arm, postmarketing surveillance study (2014–2017), conducted at 75 centers in Japan, enrolled adalimumab-na?ve patients (paid workers, including part-time) meeting ClASsification criteria for Psoriatic ARthritis (CASPAR). The primary endpoint was improvement in overall work impairment (OWI) scores from baseline to week 24. Secondary endpoints included changes in WPAI-PsA (OWI, absenteeism, presenteeism, and activity impairment), Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), psoriatic arthritis screening and evaluation (PASE) scores, Disease Activity Scores in 28 joints using C-reactive protein (DAS28[CRP]), Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) scores, Health Assessment Questionnaire-Disability Index (HAQ-DI) scores, and PASI75/90 and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20/50/70 rates. Results: In the effectiveness population (n = 106; 72.6% men; mean ± standard deviation [SD] age, 49.3 ± 10.7?years), OWI scores significantly improved (mean ± SD change, ? 25.2 ± 35.3; p < 0.0001) from baseline to week 24. Other WPAI domain scores also improved significantly. Changes in OWI were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with PASE (r = 0.6284), DAS28(CRP) (r = 0.6059), BASDAI (r = 0.7281), and HAQ-DI (r = 0.6161) scores and were significantly influenced by previous nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use (p = 0.0142), and baseline PASE (p = 0.0098), DAS28(CRP) (p = 0.0026), HAQ-DI (p = 0.0004), and BASDAI (p < 0.0001) scores. At the last evaluation, rate (95% confidence interval) of PASI 75 and 90 (n = 100) was 58.0% (47.7–67.8) and 39.0% (29.4–49.3), respectively, and that of ACR 20, 50, and 70 (n = 58) was 86.2% (74.6–93.9), 70.7% (57.3–81.9), and 53.4% (39.9–66.7), respectively. No new safety signals were observed in the safety population (n = 148). Conclusion: Adalimumab treatment improved WPAI in patients with PsA.

Worse health status, as evaluated by the SHQ, may indicate higher risk for deterioration in the following 5 years. Objectives: To evaluate the association between SHQ scores and deterioration defined clinically at 5-year follow-up. Methods: 122 patients with biopsy-supported sarcoidosis completed the SHQ and underwent evaluation with respect to organ involvement, chest radiograph, electrocardiogram, serum biomarker measurements, pulmonary function tests, and echocardiogram. Of these 122, 88 (72.1%) were available for pulmonary, cardiac, and non-pulmonary, non-cardiac deterioration assessment during the following 5 years. Measurements and main results: Five-year deterioration was observed in 20 patients (23%). The SHQ total score was significantly associated with 5-year deterioration, after adjusting for cardiac involvement at baseline, with adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.54 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.29–0.99). The association of the total SHQ with 5-year outcome was not significant when adjusted for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) at baseline (adjusted OR, 0.61 [0.32–1.16]), whereas LVEF was significantly associated with 5-year outcome (adjusted OR, 0.92 [0.86–0.99]). The association between total SHQ score and 5-year deterioration was marginal when adjusted for baseline usage of systemic corticosteroid (CS)/immunosuppressive (IS) agents (adjusted OR, 0.58 [0.31–1.10]), whereas systemic CS/IS usage significantly predicted 5-year deterioration (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 3.46 [1.12–10.7]). There was a marginal correlation between the total SHQ and LVEF (rho = 0.19, p = 0.07) and a weak association between the total SHQ and systemic CS/IS usage (rho = ?0.23, p = 0.03). The Physical Functioning domain scores of the SHQ were significantly associated with 5-year deterioration (adjusted OR, 0.45–0.51). Conclusions: Worse health status, as assessed by the SHQ score, can be a risk factor for 5-year deterioration of sarcoidosis, although usage of the CS/IS at baseline and lower LVEF at baseline are more predictive of 5-year deterioration. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Health status; Health-related quality of life; Outcomes; Questionnaire; Sarcoidosis,biological marker; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase; immunosuppressive agent; soluble interleukin 2 receptor; adult; Article; clinical article; clinical feature; corticosteroid therapy; electrocardiogram; female; follow up; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; health status; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; lung function test; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; questionnaire; sarcoidosis; sarcoidosis health questionnaire; Short Form 36; St. George Respiratory Questionnaire; systemic therapy; thorax radiography,2-s2.0-85060169966

We investigated the possible association between PPD and MIB at one month after birth, in addition, the changes of these indices by parity. From a dataset comprising 103,099 maternal registrations in The Japan Environment and Children's Study, the present study analyzed complete data on questionnaires for 76,363 women who participated once (cross-sectional group) and 3753 women who participated twice (follow-up subgroup). Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores and the Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale-Japan (MIBS-J) scores were obtained one month after delivery. We identified the two factors of the MIBS-J, “lack of maternal feeling (LMF)” and “anxiety about caregiving (AC)” through confirmatory factor analysis. Associations between total EPDS and each factor of MIBS-J were evaluated using multiple regression analyses after adjusting for potential confounders. Total EPDS and both factors (LMF and AC) were positively related in the cross-sectional group (fully adjusted β = 0.26 and 0.39 for LMF and AC, respectively), in the follow-up subgroup at first participation (0.24 and 0.40, respectively) and at the second participation (0.25 and 0.39, respectively). Multiple regression analyses revealed a robust, moderate relationship between postpartum depression and mother-infant bonding. PPD and MIB scores were shown to decrease from the first child to the second in the follow-up subgroup. Consequently, interventions which would increase a mother's child care experience and expertise would prevent PPD and improve MIB. ? 2018 The Authors",Birth cohort; Bonding; Maternal attachment; Parenting; Parity; Postpartum depression,alcohol consumption; anxiety; Article; child care; cohort analysis; confirmatory factor analysis; cross-sectional study; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; female; follow up; human; infant; Japan; Japanese (people); maternal age; medical history; mother; mother child relation; obstetric delivery; parity; postnatal depression; prevalence; priority journal; smoking,2-s2.0-85060019332

We conducted the current study to discover non-invasive urinary biomarkers for diagnosing CRC. Among urine samples from 258 patients (CRC, n = 148; healthy controls, n = 110), a cohort of 176 patients composed of 88 patients with GC and 88 healthy controls was selected after age- and sex-matching using propensity score. This cohort was then randomly divided into 2 groups: 53 pairs (106 patients) in the training cohort, and 35 pairs (70 patients) in the validation cohort. No significant differences were found for baseline characteristics between the CRC and healthy control groups in both training and validation cohorts. On multivariate analysis in the training cohort, urinary levels of cysteine-rich protein 61 (uCyr61) and trefoil factor 3 (uTFF3) were identified as independent significant diagnostic markers for CRC. Moreover, uCyr61 alone and the combination of uCyr61 and uTFF3 allowed significant differentiation between healthy controls and CRC groups in the training set (uCyr61: area under the curve (AUC) = 0.745 [95% CI, 0.653–0.838]; uCyr61 + uTFF3: AUC = 0.753 [95% CI, 0.659–0.847]). In the validation cohort, uCyr61 and uTFF3 were significantly higher in the CRC group than in the healthy control group, and they also allowed significant differentiation between healthy control and CRC groups (uCyr61: AUC = 0.696 [95% CI, 0.571–0.822]; uTFF3: AUC = 0.639 [95% CI, 0.508–0.770]; uCyr61 + uTFF3: AUC = 0.720 [95% CI, 0.599–0.841]), as in the training cohort.

We studied whole genome copy number profiles using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) analysis of tumor tissue samples obtained in this study. The aim of this study was to identify gene copy number alterations that could aid in selecting either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in combination with bevacizumab for patients with mCRC. Materials and Methods: DNA was purified from 154 pretreatment formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples (75 from the FOLFOX arm and 79 from the FOLFIRI arm) of 395 patients enrolled in the WJOG4407G trial and analyzed by aCGH. Genomic regions greater than 1.2-fold were regarded as copy number gain (CNG). Results: Patient characteristics between the treatment arms were well balanced except for tumor laterality (left side; 64% in FOLFOX arm and 80% in FOLFIRI arm, p =.07). FOLFIRI showed a trend toward better response rate (RR), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) than FOLFOX in the patients with CNG of chromosome 8q24.1 (Fisher's exact test, p =.134 for RR; interaction test, p =.102 for PFS and p =.003 for OS) and 8q24.2 (Fisher's exact test, p =.179 for RR; interaction test, p =.144 for PFS and p =.002 for OS). Conclusion: Chromosome 8q24.1–q24.2 may contain genes that could potentially serve as predictive markers for selecting either FOLFOX or FOLFIRI in combination with bevacizumab for treatment of patients with mCRC. Implications for Practice: Bevacizumab has been used as a standard first-line treatment for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) in combination with either oxaliplatin-based or irinotecan-based chemotherapy. Until now, there has been no predictive marker to choose between the two combination chemotherapies. This array-based comparative genomic hybridization analysis revealed that the difference in therapeutic effect between the two combination chemotherapies is prominent in patients with mCRC with gene copy number gain in chromosome 8p24.1–p24.2. Such patients showed more favorable response and survival when treated with irinotecan-based combination chemotherapy. Overlapping genes commonly found in this region may be predictive biomarkers of the efficacy of the combination chemotherapy with bevacizumab. ?

To determine whether the increased susceptibility of bank voles to prion diseases can be attributed to the intrinsic nature of bank vole prion protein (PrP) or to host factors other than PrP, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing bank vole PrP. These transgenic mice spontaneously developed neurological illness with spongiform changes and the accumulation of abnormal PrP in the brain. Then, we produced transgenic mice overexpressing chimeric mouse/bank vole PrP, which differs from mouse PrP only at two residues located at the C-terminus, to determine the minimum essential domain for the induction of spontaneous generation of abnormal PrP. These transgenic mice also developed spontaneous neurological illness with spongiform changes and the accumulation of abnormal PrP in the brain. In addition, knock-in mice expressing bank vole PrP at the same level as that of wild-type mice did not develop spontaneous disease but showed high susceptibility to infection with diverse prion strains, similarly to bank voles. Taken together, these findings show that bank vole PrP has a high propensity for the conformational conversion both in spontaneous disease and in prion infection, probably due to the characteristic structural properties of the C-terminal domain. ? 2018 International Society of Neuropathology",bank vole; misfolding; prion; prion disease,"prion protein; prion protein; Prnp protein, mouse; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; gene overexpression; mouse; Myodes glareolus; nonhuman; prion disease; protein domain; amino acid sequence; animal; Arvicolinae; brain; disease model; disease predisposition; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; metabolism; prion; transgenic mouse; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Arvicolinae; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Susceptibility; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Prion Diseases; Prion Proteins; Prions",2-s2.0-85055694716

Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-based urine metabolomics demonstrated significant elevations of dihydrouracil and dihydrothymine, which were subsequently confirmed by a quantitative analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Genetic testing of the DPYS gene revealed two mutations: a novel mutation (c.175G > T) and a previously reported mutation (c.1469G > A). Dihydropyrimidinase deficiency is probably underdiagnosed, considering its wide phenotypical variability, nonspecific neurological presentations, and an estimated prevalence of 2/20,000.

These concertedly confer allele specificity on 15q11-13. Here, we report DNA methylation status of 15q11-13 and other autosomal imprinted differentially methylated regions (iDMRs) in cases with various deletions within the PWS/AS-responsible region. Methods: We performed array-based methylation analysis and examined the methylation status of CpG sites in 15q11-13 and in 71 iDMRs in six cases with various microdeletions, eight cases with conventional deletions within 15q11-13, and healthy controls. Results: We detected 89 CpGs in 15q11-13 showing significant methylation changes in our cases. Of them, 14 CpGs in the SNORD116s cluster presented slight hypomethylation in the PWS cases and hypermethylation in the AS cases. No iDMRs at regions other than 15q11-13 showed abnormal methylation. Conclusions: We identified CpG sites and regions in which methylation status is regulated by AS-IC and PWS-IC. This result indicated that each IC had unique functions and coordinately regulated the DNA methylation of respective alleles.

It is suggested that individuals with PTSD exhibit memory bias; while evidence shows poor memory function in these individuals. We aimed to examine memory bias in PTSD patients relative to controls and to explore an association between memory bias and memory function. Methods: Forty-six women with DSM-IV PTSD, most of whom developed the disorder after interpersonal violence, and 68 non-trauma-exposed healthy control women were studied. Memory bias was assessed by a recognition memory task using negative, neutral, and positive words. Memory function was assessed by a standardized neuropsychological test battery. Depression and anxiety symptoms were assessed by self-report measures. Results: Compared to controls, patients showed significantly greater negative bias scores (i.e., correctly recognized rates for negative words minus those for neutral words) and poorer memory function. Negative bias scores were significantly correlated with worse memory function in patients. When patients were divided into those with lower vs. normal memory function, the former patients had significantly greater negative bias than the latter patients and controls. Memory bias scores in patients were not significantly correlated with depression or anxiety symptoms, nor were they significantly different between patients with comorbid major depressive disorder and those without. Limitations: The cross-sectional design and absence of the trauma-exposed non-PTSD group limited our findings. Conclusions: PTSD patients have greater negative memory bias, which can be associated with poorer memory function.

They performed 5-min PVT for three times; before, during the last 5 min of 8-min gum chewing, and 3 min after ceasing it. Sustained attention evaluated as the number of lapses (>1000 ms) improved both during and after chewing gum (P = 0.01).

Diffuse TGCT (D-TGCT) most commonly develops in the knee, followed by the hip, ankle, elbow, and shoulder. Surgical removal is the only effective treatment option for the patients. However, a local recurrence rate as high as 47% has been reported. Recently, we revealed that zaltoprofen, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug possessing the ability to activate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), can inhibit the proliferation of TGCT stromal cells via PPARγ. PPARγ is a ligand-activated transcription factor that belongs to the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily. It plays an important role in the differentiation of adipocytes from precursor cells and exhibits antitumorigenic effects on certain malignancies. Therefore, we are conducting this investigator-initiated clinical trial to evaluate whether zaltoprofen is safe and effective for patients with D-TGCT or unresectable localized TGCT (L-TGCT). Methods: This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zaltoprofen for patients with D-TGCT or L-TGCT. For the treatment group, zaltoprofen 480 mg/day will be administered for 48 weeks; the placebo group will receive similar dosages without zaltoprofen. Twenty participants in each group are needed in this trial (40 participants total). The primary outcome is the progression-free rate at 48 weeks after treatment administration. ""Progression"" is defined as any serious events (1. Repetitive joint swelling due to hemorrhage, 2. Joint range of motion limitation, 3. Invasion of adjacent cartilage or bone, 4. Severe joint space narrowing, 5. Increase in tumor size) requiring surgical interventions. We hypothesize that the zaltoprofen group will have a higher progression-free rate compared to that of the placebo group at 48 weeks. Discussion: This is the first study to evaluate the efficacy of zaltoprofen in patients with D-TGCT or unresectable L-TGCT. We believe that the results of this trial will validate a novel treatment option, zaltoprofen, to stabilize disease progression for TGCT patients.

However, there have been no reports on the influence of physical activity earlier in life on subsequent glucose metabolism. Therefore, we analyzed the influence of physical activity in earlier decades of life on insulin resistance in middle aged and older residents in Japan. Methods: The subjects were 6,883 residents of Okazaki City between the ages of 40 and 79 years who underwent physical examinations at the Okazaki City Medical Association Public Health Center from April 2007 through August 2011. They gave informed consent for participation in the study. Data on individual characteristics were collected via a questionnaire and from the health examination records. Fasting blood glucose and insulin levels were used to calculate the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). HOMA-IR >1.6 was considered to indicate insulin resistance for the purpose of logistic regression models. Results: The study sample included 3,683 men and 3,200 women for whom complete information was available. For those who exercised regularly throughout their teens to their 30s-40s, the odds ratio for having insulin resistance was 0.75 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.58-0.96) for men and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.58-0.99) for women after adjusting for other variables, including age, body mass index, and present physical activity. A linear trend was also observed in both men and women. Conclusions: Subjects who have exercised regularly in the early decades of life are less likely to have insulin resistance later in life. ? 2018 Hitomi Fujita et al.",Diabetes mellitus; HOMA-IR; Insulin resistance; Lifestyle related diseases; Physical activity,adult; aged; exercise; female; human; insulin resistance; Japan; male; middle aged; Adult; Aged; Exercise; Female; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Japan; Male; Middle Aged,2-s2.0-85061152698

Methods: This cross-sectional study included pregnant women (n = 16,955) enrolled in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study. Concentrations of Cd and Pb in blood samples collected at 22–28?weeks’ gestation were measured by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. GDM was diagnosed according to the 2011 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology and Japan Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists criteria. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression analysis. Results: Blood Cd and Pb concentrations were slightly higher among women with GDM than among those without GDM; however, these differences were not statistically significant. Elevated blood Cd and Pb concentrations were not associated with increased GDM risk in the nulliparous group (Cd OR 0.76; 95% CI 0.28–2.08 for high vs low category; Pb OR 2.51; 95% CI 0.72–8.72) or the parous group (Cd OR 0.64; 95% CI 0.29–1.44; Pb OR 0.31; 95% CI 0.04–2.29). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Cd and Pb exposure, in the range of blood levels observed, has no significant relationship with the development of GDM. Further prospective studies would be valuable to confirm these findings. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Birth cohort; Cadmium; Gestational diabetes mellitus; JECS; Lead; Pregnant women,"cadmium; lead; adult; blood; cross-sectional study; female; human; Japan; parity; pregnancy; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; Adult; Cadmium; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes, Gestational; Female; Humans; Japan; Lead; Parity; Pregnancy",2-s2.0-85055749580

This study examined whether mother's exposure to mass media was associated with child's diarrhea, and with the diarrhea management practiced by their mothers. Data on 7,068 women, whose youngest child was under five years old, were extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey, 2011, together with information on the child. The outcome variables were an episode of diarrhea in the two weeks prior to the survey and diarrhea management practices; exposure to mass media was used as the major explanatory variable. They were descriptively summarized, and logistic regression analyses were performed. Television was found to be the most common form of media. Among 346 children who had experienced an episode of diarrhea in the previous 2 weeks, less than 42.5% were given zinc and only 26.3% of the mothers provided sufficient fluids. No significant associations between mother's mass media exposure and child's diarrhea were observed. Women who read newspapers/magazines were more likely to provide sufficient fluids and food, and those exposed to the radio were more likely to provide zinc supplementation. Since mother's exposure to newspaper/magazines and radio showed associations with some recommended practices for the treatment of childhood diarrhea, mass media clearly has the potential to improve diarrhea management practices. More effective use of mass media is anticipated; in particular, promotion of zinc supplementation and increasing fluid intake during diarrhea, neither of which were currently well practiced. ? 2018, Nagoya University.",Bangladesh; Child; Demographic and health survey; Diarrhea; Mass media; Oral rehydration therapy; Zinc,adolescent; adult; Bangladesh; child; demography; diarrhea; female; fluid therapy; health survey; human; male; mass medium; middle aged; statistical model; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Bangladesh; Child; Demography; Diarrhea; Female; Fluid Therapy; Health Surveys; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mass Media; Middle Aged; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85062905567

A total of 538 eyes of 477 patients diagnosed with CSC, with 3 months or more of follow-up between April 2013 and June 2017 at 8 institutions. Patients with CSC with more than 3 months of follow-up were identified by OCT and fluorescein angiography at 8 institutions. Data collected included patient demographics, history of corticosteroid medication and smoking, spherical errors, findings of angiography, subfoveal choroidal thickness, and changes through the follow-up period. Differences in these findings were analyzed in cases with and without corticosteroid treatment. Among the 477 patients (344 men,133 women), 74 (15.5%) (39 men, 35 women) underwent current or prior steroid treatment. Cases with steroids were higher age (p = 0.0403) and showed no male prevalence, more bilateral involvement (p < 0.0001), and the affected eyes had multiple pigment epithelial detachment (p <0.0001), more fluorescein leakage sites (p < 0.0001), greater choroidal thickness (p = 0.0287) and a higher recurrence rate (p = 0.0412).

Drusen are yellowish extracellular deposits beneath retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) found in aging eyes and considered as a biomarker of AMD. However, the biogenesis of drusen has not been elucidated. We reported previously that multicellular spheroids of human RPE cells constructed a well-differentiated monolayer of RPE with a Bruch’s membrane. We determined that RPE spheroids exhibited drusen formation between the RPE and Bruch’s membrane with expression of many drusen-associated proteins, such as amyloid β and complement components, the expression of which was altered by a challenge with oxidative stress. Artificial lipofuscin-loaded RPE spheroids yielded drusen more frequently. In the current study, we showed that drusen originates from the RPE. This culture system is an attractive tool for use as an in vitro drusen model, which might help elucidate the biogenesis of drusen and the pathogenesis of related diseases, such as AMD. ? 2018.

Objective: Determine the indications, complications, and clinical outcomes in patients requiring fusions from the cervical spine to the pelvis. Several investigators have examined fusions from the thoracic spine to the sacrum, but no similar study has been performed for cervical-to-pelvis fusions. Methods: Patients from 2003 to 2014 with an upper instrumented vertebrae (UIV) in the cervical spine (any level) and a lower instrumented vertebrae (LIV) in the sacrum or pelvis were included in the study. Those with infectious or acute trauma-related deformities were excluded. Patient demographics, medical history, diagnosis, operative procedure, and health-related quality of life measures were analyzed. Student’s t test, Kruskal-Wallis test, and χ 2 test were used as appropriate; significance was set at P &lt;.05 for all tests. Results: Fifty-five patients met inclusion criteria for the study. Average follow-up was 2.8 years. Proximal junctional kyphosis was the most common indication for cervical-to-pelvis fusions (36%). The most common UIV was C2 (29%) followed by C7 (24%). There was an average 31° correction in maximum kyphosis and a 3.3 cm improvement in sagittal vertical axis. In adults, the rate of complication was 71.4%, with a major complication rate of 39.3% and reoperation rate of 53.6%. There was significant improvement in the Scoliosis Research Society (SRS-22r) score (3.0 to 3.5; P &lt;.01). Conclusion: Proximal junctional kyphosis is the most common indication for patients requiring fusion to the cervical spine.

Recent studies demonstrated that TDP-43 binds to the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of target mRNAs to promote mRNA instability. Here, we show that TDP-43 recruits Caf1 deadenylase to mRNA targets and accelerates their deadenylation. Tethering TDP-43 to the mRNA 3′UTR recapitulates destabilization of the mRNA, and TDP-43 accelerates their deadenylation. This accelerated deadenylation is inhibited by a dominant negative mutant of Caf1. We find that TDP-43 physically interacts with Caf1.

Although only red light around 635 nm and blue light around 400 nm are used as light sources for PDT, the efficiency of PDT might be improved by using multiple wavelengths, including those that correspond to the other absorption peaks of PpIX. Furthermore, because the target disease often occurs on the face, a flexible-type light-source unit that can be fitted to the lesion without unnecessarily exposing the mucous membranes, e.g., the eyes, nostrils, and mouth, is preferred. Objective: We investigated the efficacy of a flexible light-emitting diode (LED) unit that emits multiple wavelengths to improve PDT effects. Methods: HaCaT cells were incubated with 5-ALA and subsequently irradiated with either a single wavelength or sequentially with two wavelengths. Cell viability and reactive oxygen species were analyzed. Nude mice were implanted with COLO679 cells by subcutaneous injection into the flank. 5-ALA was subcutaneously injected into the tumor. The tumor was irradiated with 50 J/cm 2 (day 0) and assessed daily until day 21. Results: The synergistic PDT effects of dual-wavelength irradiation and reactive oxygen species production were highest with the 405-nm and 505-nm wavelength combination. This dual wavelength combination was also the most effective in vivo. Conclusion: We could therefore conclude that dual-wavelength PDT is an efficient strategy for improving the therapeutic effects of PDT. Using a flexible LED unit is expected to achieve more uniform irradiation of uneven areas. ? 2019 Japanese Society for Investigative Dermatology",5-ALA; Dual wavelength; Flexible LED unit; PDT,"aminolevulinic acid; reactive oxygen metabolite; aminolevulinic acid; photosensitizing agent; reactive oxygen metabolite; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; HaCat cell line; human; human cell; in vivo study; light; melanoma; mouse; nonhuman; nude mouse; photodynamic therapy; priority journal; synergistic effect; therapy effect; tumor volume; animal; cell line; devices; drug effect; keratinocyte; metabolism; photochemotherapy; procedures; radiation response; Aminolevulinic Acid; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Humans; Keratinocytes; Mice, Nude; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Reactive Oxygen Species",2-s2.0-85060542951

We also examined the expression of candidate genes in male mouse embryos to determine the possible underlying mechanisms of this disease.Materials and Methods:We enrolled 169 Japanese patients (mean age at surgery 3.7 years) who underwent repair of hypospadias. Genotyping of 17 single nucleotide polymorphisms was performed using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction invader assay. We also performed in situ hybridization to determine whether candidate genes were expressed in the male genital tubercle during embryonic development of the external genitalia in mice.Results:Single nucleotide polymorphism rs3816183 of HAAO was significantly associated with susceptibility to hypospadias in general (p = 0.0019) and to anterior/middle hypospadias (p = 0.0283) and posterior hypospadias (p = 0.0226), while single nucleotide polymorphism rs6499755 of IRX6 showed an association with susceptibility to anterior/middle hypospadias (p = 0.0472). In mouse embryos there was no significant upregulation of Haao expression in the developing male external genitalia. Irx3 and Irx5, which are linked to Irx6 within the IrxB cluster, were expressed in the mesenchyme remote from the urethral plate epithelium during the critical embryonic period for masculinization. Irx6 was expressed in the ectodermal epithelium, demonstrating prominent dorsal ectodermal expression without expression in the ventral ectoderm adjacent to the urethral plate during the same period.Conclusions:Genetic variations of HAAO and IRX6 influence susceptibility to hypospadias in the Japanese population. Further research is needed to clarify the mechanism by which variations in these genes contribute to the pathogenesis of hypospadias. ? 2019 by AMERICAN UROLOGICAL ASSOCIATION EDUCATION AND RESEARCH, INC.","hypospadias; in situ hybridization; polymorphism,; single nucleotide","messenger RNA; 3 hydroxyanthranilate 3,4 dioxygenase; homeodomain protein; IRX6 protein, human; Irx6 protein, mouse; transcription factor; allele; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; ectoderm; embryo; embryo development; expression quantitative trait locus; gene; gene expression; genetic association; genetic variation; genital system; genome-wide association study; genotype; HAAO gene; hypospadias; in situ hybridization; IRX3 gene; IRX5 gene; IRX6 gene; IRXB gene; Japanese (people); male; mesenchyme; mouse; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; priority journal; risk factor; single nucleotide polymorphism; upregulation; adolescent; animal; Asian continental ancestry group; child; gene expression regulation; genetic predisposition; genetics; growth, development and aging; human; hypospadias; infant; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; Japan; mammalian embryo; metabolism; newborn; organogenesis; preschool child; single nucleotide polymorphism; urethra; 3-Hydroxyanthranilate 3,4-Dioxygenase; Adolescent; Animals; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Child; Child, Preschool; Ectoderm; Embryo, Mammalian; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Hypospadias; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Organogenesis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Transcription Factors; Urethra",2-s2.0-85060039798

In the present study, a total of 184 cases with early distant recurrence detected within 5 years following the primary operation, 134 with late distant recurrence diagnosed following 5 years or longer and 321 controls without recurrence for >10 years following starting the initial treatment for ER-positive/HER2 negative breast cancer, registered in 9 institutions, were analyzed. The distributions of TILs and their clinical relevance were investigated. TIL distributions did not differ significantly among the early, late and no recurrence groups, employing a 30% cut-off point as a dichotomous variable. In those who had received adjuvant chemotherapy as well as endocrine therapy, a trend toward higher TIL proportions was detected when the early recurrence group was compared with the no recurrence group employing the 30% cut-off point (P=0.064). The TIL distributions were significantly associated with nodal metastasis (P=0.004), ER status (P=0.045), progesterone receptor (PgR) status (P=0.002), tumor grade (P=0.021), and the Ki67 labeling index (LI) (P=0.002) in the no recurrence group and with the Ki67 LI in the recurrence groups (P=0.002 in early recurrence group, P=0.023 in late recurrence group). High TIL distributions also predicted shorter survival time following the detection of recurrence (P=0.026). However, these prognostic interactions were not significant in multivariate analysis (P=0.200). The present retrospective study demonstrated no significant interaction between TIL proportions and the timing of recurrence. However, higher TIL proportions were observed in breast cancer patients with aggressive biological phenotypes, which tended to be more responsive to chemotherapy. The clinical relevance of stromal TILs for identifying patients who would likely benefit from additional therapies merits further investigation in a larger patient population. ? 2019, Spandidos Publications.

We performed a meta-analysis to determine a potential etiology of C5 palsy. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to 2017 for relevant studies of the incidence of C5 palsy after cervical decompression surgery. Relevant incident estimates of C5 palsy stratified by the surgical approach and underlying diagnosis were calculated using an appropriate meta-analysis. Results: A total of 107 studies were included for our meta-analysis. The pooled incidence of C5 palsy was 0.00 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.00–0.01) for anterior decompression in patients with radiculopathy, 0.04 (95% CI, 0.03–0.05) for anterior decompression and 0.07 (95% CI, 0.06–0.08) for posterior decompression in patients with myelopathy. A two-tailed t test with unequal variance accepted the null hypothesis of no differences in the incidence between anterior and posterior decompression in patients with myelopathy (P = 0.999) and rejected the hypothesis of no differences in the incidence between the patients with radiculopathy and myelopathy in anterior decompression (P < 0.001). Conclusions: With no significant difference found in the incidence of C5 palsy between anterior and posterior cervical decompression in patients with myelopathy, the tethering effect of the spinal nerve might not be a plausible etiology for C5 palsy. In contrast, we found a significantly greater incidence of C5 palsy in patients with myelopathy compared with those with radiculopathy undergoing anterior decompression, which might support the reperfusion injury of the spinal cord as the etiology of C5 palsy. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Anterior cervical surgery; C5 palsy; Cervical decompression; Etiology; Incidence; Meta-analysis; Myelopathy; Pathomechanism; Posterior cervical surgery; Radiculopathy,"Article; decompression surgery; human; incidence; meta analysis; radiculopathy; reperfusion injury; spinal cord disease; spinal nerve; spinal paralysis; surgical approach; cervical vertebra; clinical trial (topic); paralysis; pathology; procedures; prospective study; retrospective study; risk factor; spinal cord disease; spinal root; trends; Cervical Vertebrae; Clinical Trials as Topic; Decompression, Surgical; Humans; Incidence; Paralysis; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Spinal Cord Diseases; Spinal Nerve Roots",2-s2.0-85057770996

Computed tomography demonstrated symmetrical massive brain calcification involving the bilateral basal ganglia, thalami, dentate nuclei and cerebral gray/white matter junctions, which was consistent with Fahr's syndrome. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed extensive white matter changes sparing the corpus callosum. Severe ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament of the cervical spine was also demonstrated. A neuropathological examination revealed massive intracranial calcification within the walls of the blood vessels and capillaries with numerous calcium deposits. The calcium deposits aligned along the capillaries, and deposits in the vessel wall at the initial stage were confined to the border between the tunica media and adventitia. The vascular calcification in the basal ganglia continuously spread over the surrounding white matter into the cortex. The area of vascular calcification in the white matter was very well correlated with the area of the attenuated myelin staining. Axonal loss, myelin sheath loss and gliosis were observed in the white matter with severe vascular calcification.

However, the local tissue environment can reduce the viability/function of transplanted cells when placed directly on the injury. Although gelatin hydrogels have been shown to aid cell survival during transplantation, such OSC-hydrogel combinations have not been extensively tested, particularly during recovery from facial nerve palsy. In this study, OSCs were isolated from the olfactory mucosae of newborn mice and were shown to express neural stem cell markers before differentiation, as well as cell-type specific markers after differentiation, confirming their multipotency. The OSCs also secrete growth factors and various cytokines that promote nerve regeneration. To test the effects of OSC transplantation in vivo, Medgel, a biodegradable hydrogel sponge, was applied to retain OSCs around the injury site and to lessen the detrimental effects of the local environment in an established facial nerve palsy mouse model. When OSCs were transplanted into the injury site, accelerated recovery was observed for 1 week. When OSCs were transplanted with Medgel, a higher level and duration of accelerated recovery was observed. OSCs in Medgel also increased peripheral nerve function and increased the number of regenerated nerve fibers. These results suggest that OSCs implanted with Medgel accelerate and enhance recovery from facial palsy in mice. Because human OSCs can be easily obtained from olfactory mucosa biopsies with limited risk, this OSC-Medgel combination is a candidate treatment option for accelerating recovery after facial nerve injury.

Patients with dizziness experience balance problems and anxiety, which can lead to decreased physical activity levels and participation in their daily activities. Moreover, recovery of vestibular function from vestibular injury requires physical activity. Although there are reports that decreased physical activity is associated with handicap, anxiety, postural instability and reduced recovery of vestibular function in patients with chronic dizziness, these data were collected by self-report questionnaires. Therefore, the objective data of physical activity and the relationships between physical activity, handicap, anxiety and postural stability in patients with chronic dizziness are not clear. The purpose of this research was to objectively measure the physical activity of patients with chronic dizziness in daily living as well as handicap, anxiety and postural stability compared to healthy adults. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the relationships between physical activity, handicap, anxiety and postural stability in patients with chronic dizziness. Methods: Twenty-eight patients with chronic dizziness of more than 3 months caused by unilateral vestibular hypofunction (patient group) and twenty-eight age-matched community dwelling healthy adults (healthy group) participated in this study. The amount of physical activity including time of sedentary behavior, light physical activity, moderate to vigorous physical activity and total physical activity using tri-axial accelerometer, self-perceived handicap and anxiety using questionnaires, and postural stability were measured using computerized dynamic posturography. Results: The results showed worse handicap, anxiety and postural stability in the patient group compared to the healthy group. Objective measures of physical activity revealed that the patient group had significantly longer time of sedentary behavior, shorter time of light physical activity, and shorter time of total physical activity compared to the healthy group; however, time of moderate to vigorous physical activity was not significantly different between groups. Moreover, there were correlations between physical activity and postural stability in the patient group, while there were no correlations between physical activity, handicap or anxiety in the patient group. Conclusion: These results suggest that objectively measured physical activity of the patients with chronic unilateral vestibular hypofunction is lower compared to the healthy adults, and less active patients showed decreased postural stability. However, the details of physical activity and causal effect between physical activity and postural stability were not clear and further investigation is needed. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Accelerometer; Anxiety; Chronic dizziness; Inactivity; Physical activity; Postural stability,adult; anxiety; Article; bilateral vestibulopathy; body equilibrium; clinical article; community dwelling person; controlled study; disability; disease assessment; disease association; dizziness; Dizziness Handicap Inventory; electronystagmography; female; functional status assessment; human; male; metabolic equivalent; physical activity; rating scale; sedentary lifestyle; stabilography; State Trait Anxiety Inventory; vertigo; Vertigo Symptom Scale; accelerometry; aged; anxiety; body size; case control study; chi square distribution; chronic disease; complication; disabled person; exercise; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; psychology; questionnaire; self evaluation; self report; vestibular disorder; vestibular test; Accelerometry; Aged; Anxiety; Body Size; Case-Control Studies; Chi-Square Distribution; Chronic Disease; Disabled Persons; Exercise; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postural Balance; Self Report; Self-Assessment; Surveys and Questionnaires; Vestibular Diseases; Vestibular Function Tests,2-s2.0-85049326577

Methods: Forty eyes of 39 patients (24 males and 15 females with an average age of 71 years) were retrospectively reviewed. One patient had BRVO bilaterally. WFFA was performed in all patients to evaluate perfusion status and detect microvascular abnormalities. The WFFA images were divided into 3 zones: zone 1, posterior pole; zone 2, mid-periphery; zone 3, far periphery, in order to document the presence of microvascular abnormalities. Scatter retinal photocoagulation (PC) was performed for retinal neovascularization (NV) and/or widespread nonperfused areas (NPAs). Results: The incidence of microvascular abnormalities in zone 3 was significantly (p < 0.0001) less than in zones 1 and 2. The presence of larger NPAs in zone 1, but not in zone 3, was associated with the incidence of NV and vitreous hemorrhage. The presence of peripheral lesions and the application of PC did not affect the visual outcome. Conclusion: The presence of peripheral abnormalities or scatter PC for NPAs did not affect the visual outcome in eyes with BRVO. ? 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Such behaviors can moderate or mediate the pathway between psychosocial stress and health-related outcomes. However, few studies have examined the associations between coping behaviors and genetic variants. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on coping behaviors in 14088 participants aged 35 to 69 years as part of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Five coping behaviors (emotional expression, emotional support seeking, positive reappraisal, problem solving and disengagement) were measured and analyzed. A GWAS analysis was performed using a mixed linear model adjusted for study area, age and sex. Variants with suggestive significance in the discovery phase (N = 6403) were further examined in the replication phase (N = 7685). We then combined variant-level association evidence into gene-level evidence using a gene-based analysis. The results showed a significant genetic contribution to emotional expression and disengagement, with an estimation that the 19.5% and 6.6% variance in the liability-scale was explained by common variants. In the discovery phase, 12 variants met suggestive significance (P &lt; 1 × 10 ?6 ) for association with the coping behaviors and perceived stress. However, none of these associations were confirmed in the replication stage. In gene-based analysis, FBXO45, a gene with regulatory roles in synapse maturation, was significantly associated with emotional expression after multiple corrections (P &lt; 3.1 × 10 ?6 ). In conclusion, our results showed the existence of up to 20% genetic contribution to coping behaviors. Moreover, our gene-based analysis using GWAS data suggests that genetic variations in FBXO45 are associated with emotional expression. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd and International Behavioural and Neural Genetics Society",coping behaviors; emotional expression; FBXO45; gene-based analysis; genome-wide association; Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative; neurological function; psychosocial stress; synapse maturation; ubiquitin-protein ligase E3,"F box protein; messenger RNA; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; F box protein; FBXO45 protein, human; adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; coping behavior; disease association; emotion; FBXO45 gene; female; gene; gene frequency; gene replication; genetic analysis; genetic code; genetic heterogeneity; genetic risk; genetic variation; genome-wide association study; genotype; genotype environment interaction; human; informed consent; Japan; major clinical study; male; medical information; mental stress; phenotype; priority journal; problem solving; protein expression; quality control; questionnaire; reproducibility; self report; single nucleotide polymorphism; social environment; social psychology; genetic polymorphism; genetics; middle aged; Adaptation, Psychological; Adult; Aged; Expressed Emotion; F-Box Proteins; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Genetic",2-s2.0-85046708861

Study Design: Retrospective, observational, multicenter case-series study. Methods: Patients’ data were entered into a computerized database for review and statistical analyses. The following parameters were assessed; age, gender, initial and final visual acuity, duration between onset and surgery, presence of lens in the eye, characteristics of injury, presence of ocular complications, and number of surgeries. Results: The records of 374 eyes with OGI were enrolled. The average age of the patients was 56.8 ± 22.1 years, and the majority of patients were men (73.5%). Compared to the overall cohort, work-related OGI was the most common, associated with significantly better final visual acuity, whereas patients with fall-down OGI showed significantly worse final visual acuity (P < 0.05). Among the types of injury, both the initial and final visual acuity were significantly worse in the rupture group than in the laceration group. Multiple liner regression analyses revealed that the final visual acuity was significantly associated with initial visual acuity, type of injury (rupture), retinal detachment, and proliferative vitreoretinopathy. Conclusion: To predict the visual outcome in patients with OGI, ophthalmologists need to pay attention not only to the initial visual acuity but also to initial ocular conditions, such as the presence of ocular complications. ? 2018, Japanese Ophthalmological Society.",Endophthalmitis; Laceration; Open globe injury; Rupture,"adult; Article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease activity; disease association; disease duration; eye injury; eye surgery; female; gender; groups by age; human; Japan; laceration; lens; major clinical study; male; medical record; middle aged; multicenter study; observational study; occupational disease; open globe injury; ophthalmologist; patient coding; postoperative complication; postoperative period; prediction; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; prognosis; retina detachment; retrospective study; visual acuity; vitreoretinopathy; adolescent; age distribution; aged; child; classification; clinical trial; eye injury; incidence; injury scale; preschool child; sex ratio; very elderly; visual acuity; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Eye Injuries; Female; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Trauma Severity Indices; Visual Acuity; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85056335244

We previously suggested that adjuvant breast radiotherapy in breast conservation therapy could lower memory function soon after therapy, and that the process might be partially mediated by plasma interleukin (IL)-6 levels. The present study investigated how that relationship changes longitudinally. Methods: We performed the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised (WMS-R) test and measured plasma IL-6 levels for 47 breast cancer surgical patients within 1?year after the initial therapy (study 1) and more than 2?years after study 1 (study 2). We also performed 2 × 2 mixed [the radiotherapy group (n = 25) or the no-radiotherapy group (n = 22) × study 1 or study 2] analysis of covariance on the WMS-R indices and plasma IL-6 levels. The association between changes in plasma IL-6 levels and changes in the WMS-R indices between the two studies was evaluated using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. Results: The Immediate Verbal Memory Index was significantly higher in study 2. The Delayed Recall Index was significantly higher in study 2 and significantly lower in the radiotherapy group only in study 1. There was a significant correlation between changes in plasma IL-6 levels and changes only in the Delayed Recall Index of the WMS-R. Conclusions: Memory decline in breast cancer patients soon after adjuvant breast radiotherapy was restored approximately 3?years after treatment, and decreased plasma IL-6 levels might be involved in the recovery process. ? 2018, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Breast cancer; Cognitive decline; Interleukin-6; Longitudinal study; Radiotherapy,"interleukin 6; interleukin 6; tumor marker; adjuvant radiotherapy; adult; Article; attention; breast cancer; breast radiotherapy; breast surgery; cancer patient; cancer surgery; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; longitudinal study; memory; memory disorder; middle aged; priority journal; protein blood level; radiation injury; recall; surgical patient; verbal memory; visual memory; Wechsler memory scale; adjuvant radiotherapy; adolescent; blood; breast tumor; cognition; partial mastectomy; pathology; procedures; radiation response; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Cognition; Female; Humans; Interleukin-6; Longitudinal Studies; Mastectomy, Segmental; Memory; Middle Aged; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Time Factors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85052818736

Hopeless teeth should be extracted without drug holiday before the development of inflammation in cancer patients receiving high-dose bone-modifying agents. Introduction: No studies have comprehensively analyzed the influence of pre-existing inflammation, surgical procedure–related factors such as primary wound closure, demographic factors, and drug holiday on the incidence of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ). The purpose of this study was to retrospectively investigate the relationships between these various factors and the development of MRONJ after tooth extraction in cancer patients receiving high-dose bone-modifying agents (BMAs) such as bisphosphonates or denosumab. Methods: Risk factors for MRONJ after tooth extraction were evaluated with univariate and multivariate analyses. The following parameters were investigated in all patients: demographics, type and duration of BMA use, whether BMA use was discontinued before tooth extraction (drug holiday), the duration of such discontinuation, the presence of pre-existing inflammation, and whether additional surgical procedures (e.g., incision, removal of bone edges, root amputation) were performed. Results: We found that root amputation (OR = 22.62), immunosuppressive therapy (OR = 16.61), extraction of mandibular teeth (OR = 12.14), extraction of teeth with pre-existing inflammation, and longer duration (? 8?months) of high-dose BMA (OR = 7.85) were all significantly associated with MRONJ. Conclusions: Tooth extraction should not necessarily be postponed in cancer patients receiving high-dose BMA. The effectiveness of a short-term drug holiday was not confirmed, as drug holidays had no significant impact on MRONJ incidence. Tooth extraction may be acceptable during high-dose BMA therapy until 8?months after initiation. ? 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Bisphosphonate; Denosumab; Discontinuation; Drug holiday; MRONJ,"bisphosphonic acid derivative; denosumab; bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; denosumab; immunosuppressive agent; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; drug megadose; female; human; immunosuppressive treatment; incidence; incision; inflammation; jaw osteonecrosis; major clinical study; male; osteoporosis; priority journal; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; tooth extraction; treatment duration; clinical trial; jaw osteonecrosis; middle aged; multicenter study; neoplasm; risk factor; surgery; tooth extraction; tooth root; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bisphosphonate-Associated Osteonecrosis of the Jaw; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Denosumab; Diphosphonates; Female; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tooth Extraction; Tooth Root",2-s2.0-85056079629

To evaluate the OP exposure levels, single urine sampling is commonly adopted to measure the levels of dialkylphosphates (DAPs), common OP metabolites. However, the inter-day variations of urinary DAP concentrations within subjects are supposed to be large due to the short biological half-lives of the metabolites, and it is thus considered difficult to accurately assess OP exposure during pregnancy with single sampling. This study aimed to assess intra-individual variations of DAP concentrations and the reproducibility of the exposure dose categorization of OPs according to DAP concentration ranges in pregnant women in Japan. Methods: Urine samples were collected from 62 non-smoking pregnant women (12-22 weeks of gestation) living in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. First morning void (FMV) and spot urine samples taken between lunch and dinner on the same day were collected on five different days during 2 weeks. The concentrations of DAP and creatinine in urine samples were measured using an ultra performance liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. Creatinine-adjusted and unadjusted concentrations were used for the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) calculations and surrogate category analyses. Results: For all DAP metabolites, the creatinine-adjusted single ICCs exceeded 0.4, indicating moderate reliability. Overall, ICCs of spot urine samples taken in the afternoon were better than those taken as FMV. Surrogate category analyses showed that participants were categorized accurately into four exposure dose groups according to the quartile points. Conclusion: This study indicated that a single urine sample taken in the afternoon may be useful in assessing OP exposure as long as the exposure is categorized into quartiles when conducting epidemiological studies in early to mid-pregnant women in Japan. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Intraclass correlation coefficients; Organophosphate insecticides; Pregnant women; Reproducibility,creatinine; organophosphate pesticide; adult; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; creatinine urine level; female; human; Japan; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; metabolite; pregnant woman; reproducibility; urine sampling,2-s2.0-85060695328

Between January 2002 and December 2015, 79 instances of ECMO after cardiac surgery in 73 children were retrospectively reviewed. Follow-up was completed in December 2016. Predictive risk analyses were employed concerning weaning of ECMO, hospital discharge, and mortality after discharge. Age and weight were 14.9 ± 25.6?months and 7.0 ± 5.3?kg, respectively. Median support time was 8.3 ± 4.4?days. Sixty-seven (85%) were successfully weaned off ECMO and 48 (61%) survived to hospital discharge. Multi-variate logistic regression analysis identified the first day to obtain negative fluid balance after initiation of support (adjusted odds ratio = 0.42), high serum lactate levels (0.97), and high total bilirubin (0.84) during support as significant independent factors associated with successful separation from ECMO. The first day of negative fluid balance (0.65) after successful decannulation was an independent risk factor for survival to hospital discharge. After hospital discharge, actuarial 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year survival rates were 94%, 78%, and 78%, respectively. Low weight increased the risk of death after hospital discharge by a multi-variate Cox hazard model. High serum lactate, high serum bilirubin, and unable to obtain early negative fluid balance during support impacted mortality of decannulation.

Here, we identified an mRNA quality control factor Dom34 as a novel restriction factor for a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. Downregulation of Dom34 and RNase L increases viral replication, as well as half-life of the viral RNA. Dom34 directly binds RNase L to form a surveillance complex to recognize and eliminate the exogenous RNA in a manner dependent on translation. Interestingly, the feature detected by the surveillance complex is not the specific sequence of the viral RNA but the 'exogenous nature' of the RNA. We propose the following model for the selective targeting of exogenous RNA; OAS3 activated by the exogenous RNA releases 2′-5′-oligoadenylates (2-5A), which in turn converts latent RNase L to an active dimer. This accelerates formation of the Dom34-RNase L surveillance complex, and its selective localization to the ribosome on the exogenous RNA, thereby promoting degradation of the RNA. Our findings reveal that the selective targeting of exogenous RNA in antiviral defense occurs via a mechanism similar to that in the degradation of aberrant transcripts in RNA quality control. ?

Aim of the study: We investigated the immunostimulatory activity of heated honey in vitro and in vivo. Materials and methods: For the in vitro study, we compared the differences among the inducible effects of honey subjected to various heating conditions on granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) secretion from the cultured enterocytes and investigated the active ingredient. For the in vivo study, we conducted a survival test of mice infected by Streptococcus pyogenes with and without oral administration of heated honey. Results: We found that heating the honey induced the appearance of G-CSF secretions from the cultured enterocytes, and that this appearance depended on the heating temperature and time. No G-CSF secretions appeared when honey was not heated. Mice infected with Streptococcus pyogenes that were fed heated honey revealed prolonged survival. The active ingredient in heated honey was a high-molecular compound with about 730 kDa. When this compound was hydrolyzed, galactose, glucose, rhamnose, α-ribofuranose β-ribofuranose 1,5′:1′,5-dianhydride, and 5-hydroxymethylfurfural were generated.

Methods: PubMed, CENTRAL, and the Japan Medical Abstracts Society were searched for articles published between January 1994 and January 2015 to conduct systematic review (SR), and the quality of evidence was assessed with GRADE approach. Results: Nine randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and two non-RCTs were adopted for remission induction therapy, three RCTs and two non-RCTs for plasma exchange, and five RCTs and one non-RCT for remission maintenance therapy. A significant difference was found in efficacy and safety for the following comparisons. In the non-RCT adopted for remission induction therapy, glucocorticoid (GC) + cyclophosphamide (CY) was significantly superior to GC monotherapy regarding remission. GC + intravenous CY for remission induction therapy was superior to GC + oral CY regarding death at one year, serious adverse events, and serious infection.

Since toxicity of edible milk seems to be negligible, milk EVs are applicable to use for therapeutics in human medicine. Casein separation is an important step in obtaining pure EVs from milk, and recent studies reported that adding hydrochloric acid (HCl) and acetic acid (AA) to milk accelerates casein aggregation and precipitation to facilitate EV isolation and purification; however, the effects of acidification on EVs remain unclear. In this study, we evaluated the acidification effects on milk-derived EVs with that by standard ultracentrifugation (UC). We separated casein from milk by either UC method or treatment with HCl or AA, followed by evaluation of EVs in milk serum (whey) by transmission electron microcopy (TEM), spectrophotometry, and tunable resistive pulse sensing analysis to determine EVs morphology, protein concentration, and EVs size and concentration, respectively. Moreover, we used anti-CD9, -CD63, -CD81, -MFG-E8, -HSP70, and -Alix antibodies for the detection of EVs surface and internal marker proteins by western blot (WB). Morphological features of EVs were spherical shape and similar structure was observed in isolated EVs by TEM. However, some of the EVs isolated by HCl and AA had shown rough surface. Although protein concentration was higher in whey obtained by UC, EV concentration was significantly higher in whey following acid treatment. Moreover, although all of the targeted EVs-marker-proteins were detected by WB, HCl-or AA-treatments partially degraded CD9 and CD81. These findings indicated that acid treatment successfully separated casein from milk to allow efficient EV isolation and purification but resulted in partial degradation of EV-surface proteins. Our results suggest that following acid treatment, appropriate EV-surface-marker antibodies should be used for accurate assess the obtained EVs for downstream applications. This study describes the acidification effects on EVs isolated from bovine milk for the first time. ? 2019 Rahman et al.

Extant research has shown that the effects of marital conflict on children are likely to vary by gender, indicating that gender plays a significant and complex role in the relationship between marital conflict and child adjustment. Focusing on gender, this study investigates the link between specific marital conflict tactics and children's mental health symptoms in families in which the parents live together. Methods This study gathered data from 799 children and their parents in Japan by means of a questionnaire focusing on marital conflict and child behavioral problems. Marital conflict (verbal aggression, physical aggression, stonewalling, avoidance-capitulation, child involvement, and cooperation) was assessed using a Conflict and Problem-Solving Scale. Children's behavioral problems (externalizing and internalizing symptoms) were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Results The findings highlight the significant impact of specific interparental conflict on children's behavioral problems, demonstrating that there are differences according to the child's gender. More specifically, multivariate analyses targeting boys revealed that cooperation was significantly inversely associated with externalizing problems and internalizing problems, while avoidance-capitulation and verbal aggression were significantly positively associated with externalizing problems. In contrast, multivariate analyses targeting girls revealed that cooperation was significantly inversely associated with externalizing problems and internalizing problems, while avoidance-capitulation and stonewalling were significantly positively associated with internalizing problems. Conclusion This study reveals that interparental conflict is associated with children's behavioral problems. Constructive marital conflict was significantly inversely associated with externalizing and internalizing problems in both boys and girls. Meanwhile, destructive marital conflict (i.e., avoidance-capitulation and verbal aggression) was significantly positively associated with externalizing problems in boys and significantly positively associated with internalizing problems in girls. These findings contribute to the substantial literature demonstrating the relationship between family processes and the development of disruptive behavior disorders in children. ? 2019 Hosokawa, Katsura.

There is a paucity of information about ACO in primary care. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence and describe characteristics of individuals withACOin primary care practices among patients currently diagnosed with asthma, COPD, or both; and to compare the prevalence and characteristics of ACO among the three source populations. Methods: The Respiratory Effectiveness Group conducted a crosssectional study of individuals ?40 years old and with ?2 outpatient primary care visits over a 2-year period in theUKOptimum Patient Care Research Database. Patients were classified into one of three source populations based on diagnostic codes: 1) COPD only, 2) both asthma and COPD, or 3) asthma only.ACOwas defined as the presence of all of the following 1) age ?40 years, 2) current or former smoking, 3) postbronchodilator airflow limitation (forced expiratory volume in 1 second/ forced vital capacity <0.7), and 4) ?12% and ?200 ml reversibility in post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second. Results: Among 2,165 individuals (1,015 COPD only, 395 with both asthma and COPD, and 755 asthma only), the overall prevalence of ACO was 20% (95% confidence interval, 18-23%). Patients with ACO had a mean age of 70 years (standard deviation, 11 yr), 60% were men, 73% were former smokers (the rest were current smokers), and 66% were overweight or obese. Comorbid conditions were common in patients with ACO, including diabetes (53%), cardiovascular disease (36%), hypertension (30%), eczema (23%), and rhinitis (21%). The prevalence of ACO was higher in patients with a diagnosis of both asthma and COPD (32%) compared with a diagnosis of COPD only (20%; P<0.001) or asthma only (14%; P<0.001). Demographic and clinical characteristics of ACO varied across these three source populations. Conclusions: One in five individuals with a diagnosis of COPD, asthma, or both asthma and COPD in primary care settings have ACO based on the Respiratory Effectiveness Group ACO Working group criteria.

Nevertheless, 5-year survival rate remains only 40%, necessitating new therapeutic agents. Oncolytic virotherapy entails use of replication-competent viruses to selectively kill cancer cells. We aimed to explore the potential of HF10 as an oncolytic virus against human or mouse HNSCC cell lines, and primary-cultured HNSCC cells. HF10 replicated well in all the HNSCC cells, in which it induced cytopathic effects and cell killing. Next, we investigated the oncolytic effects of HF10 in ear tumor models with human or mouse tumor cells. We detected HF10-infected cells within the ear tumors based on their expression of green fluorescent protein. HF10 injection suppressed ear tumor growth and prolonged overall survival. In the syngeneic model, HF10 infection induced tumor necrosis with infiltration of CD8-positive cells. Moreover, the splenocytes of HF10-treated mice released antitumor cytokines, IL-2, IL-12, IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha, after stimulation with tumor cells in vitro. The HF10-treated mice that survived their original tumor burdens rejected tumor cells upon re-challenge. These results suggested that HF10 killed HNSCC cells and induced antitumoral immunity, thereby establishing it as a promising agent for the treatment of HNSCC patients. ? 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.",,,2-s2.0-85071693076

In an earlier study, we demonstrated that multidrug-resistant serotype 15A-ST63 in Japan has a specific pbp1a sequence (pbp1a-13) that could promote meropenem resistance. To trace the origin of pbp1a, we analyzed isolates of serotype 19A-CC3111, which is the most prevalent non-meropenem-susceptible clone in Japan. We analyzed a total of 119 serotype 19A-CC3111 strains recovered in Japan using whole-genome sequencing. Of the 119 isolates, 53 (44.5%) harbored pbp1a-13, indicating that the clone may be the primary reservoir of the pbp1a type and that the pbp1a region may be horizontally transferred between different serotype strains. The single acquisition of pbp1a-13 seemed to cause only penicillin resistance and not multidrug resistance; a combination of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) recombination in the pbp2b and/or pbp2x region(s) with acquisition of pbp1a-13 caused multidrug resistance. Conserved amino acid motif analysis suggested that the pbp1a 370SXXK, pbp2b 448SXN, and pbp2x 337SXXN motifs were the candidates for amino acid substitutions increasing the MICs of meropenem, cefotaxime, and penicillin. We identified a specific clone that was correlated with multidrug resistance, although no correlation was observed between phylogenetic trees generated using core genomes and those generated with only the cps locus. All tested isolates were highly erythromycin resistant, and most harbored mefE within macrolide efflux genetic assembly (MEGA) elements and ermB within Tn917, which was inserted within Tn916 and exhibited a structure identical to that of Tn2017.

In this study, we evaluated the anticancer properties of Plant Enzyme Validux (PEV) using a mouse model. Five-week-old male C3H mice were randomly distributed into four experimental groups: Control, PEV only, 6Gy irradiation only, and PEV + 6Gy. PEV was orally administered daily at 500 mg/kg for 14 days prior to three rounds of 2Gy irradiation. We focused on the anticancer action and immunostimulatory effects of PEV with and without irradiation. Oncogene suppression was observed after PEV treatment as was an increase in TNF-α, suggesting an antitumor effect. PEV administration also appeared to reduce oxidative stress as evidenced by a decrease in lipid peroxidation. In addition, PEV confirmed radioprotective effect by radical blocking ability by radiation irradiation. Immunological responses to PEV administration were evidenced by an increase in number of total white blood cells and T lymphocytes. Immunotherapy is drawing more and more attention as a treatment for prostate cancer, suggesting that there will be a need for the identification of specific targets for prostate cancer and for more basic research on the genetic aspects of immunotherapy. Thus, PEV may be of use as a radioprotective supplement during radiotherapy for tumor treatment. ? 2019 Yeun-Hwa Gu et al.",,,2-s2.0-85071258906

SZT2 functions as a regulator of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling in cultured human cell lines and mouse tissues. However, it remains to be determined whether mutations in SZT2 in human patients alter mTORC1 signaling. In this study, we aimed to investigate the functional consequence of biallelic SZT2 variants in Epstein-Barr virus-induced lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) established from two patients with a typical SZT2-related neurodevelopmental disease. Increased phosphorylation of S6 kinase and S6 was identified in patient-derived cell lines under amino acid-starved condition, suggestive of constitutive hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling. This result was validated by constitutive lysosomal localization of mTOR in patients’ LCLs. Furthermore, patients’ LCLs display an excessive response to slight amino acid stimulation. Our data suggest the loss-of-function nature of SZT2 mutations in the patients, and consequent hyperactivation of mTORC1 signaling in response to both amino acid starvation and stimulation in their LCLs. By these functional analyses, the pathogenicity of newly identified SZT2 variants can be determined, allowing for more detailed characterization of genotype-phenotype correlations. ? 2019 Nakamura et al.

The aim of the present study was to synthesize acetylated glucose-conjugated chlorin (AcN003HP) and evaluate its antitumor effect and excretion. Materials and Methods: To evaluate the antitumor effect of AcN003HP, its IC50 was calculated as well as its accumulation in cancer cells was examined by flow cytometry. Confocal microscopy was used to observe the intracellular localization of AcN003HP. The excretion and antitumor effects of AcN003HP were also evaluated in vivo. Results: AcN003HP showed stronger antitumor effects and accumulation into cancer cells compared to talaporfin sodium, a conventional photosensitizer. AcN003HP was localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. In a xenograft tumor mouse model, AcN003HP showed longer excretion time from the body than G-chlorin e6, and photodynamic therapy using AcN003HP showed very strong antitumor effects. Conclusion: The safety, improved controllability, and robust antitumor effects suggest AcN003HP as a good next-generation photosensitizer. ? 2019 International Institute of Anticancer Research.

Since animal models can be sampled under controlled conditions, better standardization is possible compared with heterogeneous human studies. Transgenic rats with conditional activation of oncogenic RAS in pancreatic tissue develop PDC that closely resembles the biological and histopathological features of human PDC. Using this model, we evaluated the usefulness of leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG-1) as a serum marker. In this study, we found that LRG-1 was overexpressed in rat PDC compared with normal pancreas tissue of the control rats. Serum levels of LRG-1 were also significantly higher in rats bearing PDC than in controls. Importantly, chronic pancreatitis in male Wistar Bonn/Kobori rats, which is a widely accepted as a model of chronic pancreatitis, did not cause serum levels of LRG-1 to become elevated. These results strongly support serum LRG-1 as a candidate biomarker for noninvasive diagnosis of PDC. Our models of pancreas cancer provide a useful strategy for evaluation of candidate markers applicable to human cancer. ? 2019 The Japanese Society of Toxicologic Pathology.",Animal model; Leucine-rich α2-glycoprotein-1 (LRG-1); Pancreas cancer; Serum marker,adenovirus vector; biological marker; leucine rich alpha 2 glycoprotein 1; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; area under the curve; Article; carcinogenesis; chronic pancreatitis; controlled study; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene expression; histology; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; nonhuman; pancreas cancer; pancreas tissue; protein expression; rat; receiver operating characteristic; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sensitivity and specificity,2-s2.0-85070058945

In particular, it has been unclear how the viral components and virions are transported among the organelles. The HBV budding site has been reported to be the ER or MVB, but it has not been clearly determined. In this study, siRNA-based screening of Rab proteins using HBV-expressing cells showed that Rab5B, one of the Rab5 isoforms, has important roles in late steps of the HBV life cycle. Although Rab5 is known to work on early endosomes, this study showed that Rab5B plays a role in the transport of LHBs between the ER and MVB. Furthermore, it affects the transcription of LHBs. This is the first report on the mechanisms of HBV envelope protein transport among the organelles, and the results provide important insights into the therapeutic control of HBV infection.Viruses are considered to use vesicular trafficking in infected cells, but the details of assembly/release pathways of hepatitis B virus (HBV) are still unknown. To identify key regulators of HBV production, we performed short interfering RNA (siRNA) screening for Rab proteins, which are considered to act as molecular switches in vesicular trafficking using HepG2.2.15 cells. Among 62 Rab proteins, the suppression of Rab5B most significantly increased HBV DNA in the culture supernatant. Surprisingly, 5 days after the transfection of Rab5B siRNA, HBV DNA in the supernatant was increased more than 30-fold, reflecting the increase of infectious HBV particles. Northern blotting showed that transcription of 2.4/2.1-kb mRNA coding envelope proteins containing large hepatitis B surface protein (LHBs) was increased. Analysis of hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs) showed that transcription of HNF4, which is known to enhance 2.4-kb mRNA transcription, was regulated by Rab5B. Also, it was revealed that LHBs had accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) after Rab5B depletion but not in the multivesicular body (MVB), which is thought to be an organelle utilized for HBV envelope formation. Therefore, it was considered that Rab5B is required for the transport of LHBs from the ER to MVB. Immunofluorescent microscopy showed that HBs proteins, including LHBs, colocalized with HBc in the ER of Rab5B-depleted cells, suggesting that HBV envelopment occurs not only in the MVB but also in the ER. In conclusion, Rab5B is a key regulator of HBV production and could be a target of antiviral therapy. Copyright ? 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

Those who had specific, tangible goals for walking achieved their goal at a higher rate than did those who had a goal but no tangible elements, such as time spent or number of steps achieved. Overall, the lifestyle self-review at the pharmacy was effective for lifestyle improvement.

Compared with conventional FISH techniques using fresh cells, immunohistochemistry (IHC) is much more cost- and time-efficient, and can be readily applied to routinely prepared formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) materials. In this study, we performed tissue FISH and IHC employing FFPE specimens, and examined the usefulness of IHC as a tool for detecting CCND1, NSD2, and MAF gene rearrangements. CD138 signals were used to identify plasma cells in tissue FISH and IHC analyses. With cohort 1 (n?=?70), we performed tissue FISH and subsequently IHC, and determined IHC cut-off points. In this cohort, the sensitivity and specificity for the 3 molecules were ?.90 and ?.96, respectively. With cohort 2, using MM cases with an unknown gene status (n?=?120), we performed IHC, and the gene status was estimated using the cut-off points determined with cohort 1. The subsequent FISH analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity for the 3 molecules were ?.92 and ?.98, respectively.

Methods: We performed a prospective analysis of consecutive patients with newly diagnosed malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma enrolled between September 2010 and March 2016. We evaluated depression symptoms at two time points: before starting chemotherapy (T1) and 1?month later (T2), using PHQ-9 and known prognostic factors. We allocated participants with depressive symptoms at T1 and/or T2 to a depression group that was subdivided as follows: new depressive symptoms at T2, (“new-onset”), remission of depressive symptoms at T2 (“remission”), and persistent depressive symptoms from T1 to T2 (“persistent”). The main outcome, OS, was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier methods and multivariate Cox proportional hazards modeling. Results: Of the 294 eligible participants, we analyzed 255 patients, including 83 with depression. There were 19 participants in the new-onset, 38 in the remission, and 26 in the persistent depression group. The OS of participants with depression was significantly shorter than that of those without depression (adjusted hazard ratio [AjHR] 2.43; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.43-4.12; P?<.001). Using the never-depressive symptoms group as a reference group, AjHRs were as follows: new-onset, 1.91 (95% CI, 0.77-4.75; 0.166); remission, 2.98 (95% CI, 1.55-5.74; 0.001), and persistent, 2.17 (95%CI, 1.01-4.68; 0.047). Conclusions: Among patients with mature lymphoid malignancy, the group with depression at baseline had a poorer survival, both in the group that remained depressive and the group that recovered from depressive symptoms. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",cancer; depression; hematologic neoplasms; lymphoma; multiple myeloma; oncology; survival,adult; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer regression; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; depression; female; hematologic malignancy; hospital patient; human; longitudinal study; lymphoma; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiple myeloma; observational study; overall survival; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; prospective study; remission; survival rate; survival time; symptom,2-s2.0-85068611366

In addition to converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II, ACE also converts neurotoxic β-amyloid protein 42 (Aβ42) to Aβ40. Because of its neurotoxicity, Aβ42 is believed to play a causative role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas Aβ40 has neuroprotective effects against Aβ42 aggregation and also against metal-induced oxidative damage. Whether ACE inhibition enhances Aβ42 aggregation or impairs human cognitive ability are very important issues for preventingADonset and for optimal hypertension management. In an 8-year longitudinal study, we found here that the mean intelligence quotient of male, but not female, hypertensive patients taking ACE inhibitors declined more rapidly than that of others taking no ACE inhibitors. Moreover, the sera of all AD patients exhibited a decrease in Aβ42-to-Aβ40-converting activity compared with sera from age-matched healthy individuals. Using human amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice, we found that a clinical dose of an ACE inhibitor was sufficient to increase brain amyloid deposition. We also generated human amyloid precursor protein/ACE+/- mice and found that a decrease in ACE levels promoted Aβ42 deposition and increased the number of apoptotic neurons. These results suggest that inhibition of ACE activity is a risk factor for impaired human cognition and for triggering AD onset. ? 2019 Lin et al.

The objective of this study was to assess the optimal timing of cabazitaxel introduction. Patients and Methods: The clinical outcomes of 66 mCRPC patients receiving cabazitaxel following failure of docetaxel were retrospectively analyzed. Results: Among the parameters possibly affecting the timing of cabazitaxel introduction, only an increased prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value from the diagnosis of CRPC had a significant impact on overall survival (OS) after the introduction of cabazitaxel. Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the increased PSA value from the diagnosis of CRPC and the baseline PSA value at cabazitaxel introduction. Multivariate analysis showed that only the baseline PSA value at cabazitaxel introduction is an independent predictor of OS.

We investigated changes in patient characteristics, rate of sustained virologic response (SVR), and factors associated with SVR after anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) therapy with direct-acting antiviral (DAA) regimens in real-world practice in Japan, where patients with HCV are characterized by older age and high prevalence of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Methods. Changes in patient characteristics and SVR rates were evaluated from medical records among 10 688 patients who started interferon (IFN)-free DAA therapy between September 2014 and June 2018 in a nationwide, multicenter study. Factors associated with failure of SVR were analyzed. In particular, effects of cirrhosis or history of HCC on SVR were assessed by exact matching. Results. Patient age was becoming younger and baseline liver fibrosis was becoming milder over time. Overall SVR rate was 95.4%. The SVR rates increased over time in patients without a history of IFN-free DAA therapy. Multivariate analysis revealed that cirrhosis was unfavorably associated with achievement of SVR in both patients with genotype 1 (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.27–2.21) and genotype 2 (odds ratio, 1.69; 95% CI, 1.01–2.78). Comparisons after exact matching showed that the SVR rate was significantly lower in patients with cirrhosis than without it, whereas patients with and without a history of HCC had similar SVR rates. Conclusions. Background characteristics of patients who undergo IFN-free DAA therapy are changing in Japan. Patients without a history of IFN-free DAA therapy have high SVR rates. Exact matching confirmed that cirrhosis significantly influences the achievement of SVR in real-world settings. ? The Author(s) 2019.

Moreover, shortening the dwell time of BCG is conducted in some facilities owing to the complications associated with a long dwell time after injection. The method of BCG administration varies in each facility and even with each doctor. We evaluated whether the dwell-time and dose differences in patients who underwent intravesical BCG therapy is related to completion rates, adverse effects, and nonrecurrence rates. Methods: From November 2006 to April 2016, a total of 173 patients who received intravesical BCG therapy after transurethral resection of bladder tumor or transurethral biopsy were evaluated retrospectively. We allocated them into 4 groups based on the dose (40 or 80 mg BCG) and the dwell time (1 or 2 hours). Completion rate, side effects, and nonrecurrence rates were evaluated. Results: No significant improvement in the completion rate or reduction in side-effects was observed in any of the regimens. Although nonrecurrence rates for the 1-hour dwell time tended to be lower than the 2-hour dwell time, the difference was not significant. Conclusion: Our study suggests that reducing the BCG dose or shortening the dwell time does not reduce adverse effects or affect the nonrecurrence rate. ? 2019, Asian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention.",BCG; Dose difference; Dwell; Time difference,"BCG vaccine; immunological adjuvant; adult; aged; bladder tumor; dose response; female; follow up; human; intravesical drug administration; male; middle aged; pathology; prevention and control; prognosis; retrospective study; survival rate; time factor; tumor recurrence; very elderly; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Administration, Intravesical; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; BCG Vaccine; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Time Factors; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85066917525

As antibiotics are used for the general treatment of S. pyogenes infection, cases of treatment failure due to drug-resistant bacteria have increased. Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx (LCE) has been used as a folk medicine in northern Japan (Hokkaido). In this study, we investigated the antibacterial effect of methanol extracts of the fruit, stem, and leaf of LCE (LCEEs) against S. pyogenes using disk diffusion assay. As LCEE (fruit) had the strongest antibacterial activity among the three LCEEs, we focused on functional analysis of antibacterial effects of LCEE (fruit). LCEE (fruit) suppressed the growth of S. pyogenes in a dose-dependent manner. Morphological analysis by transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that LCEE (fruit) damaged the shape of S. pyogenes. Microplate and confocal laser microscopy analysis showed that biofilm formation was also suppressed by LCEE (fruit) in a dose-dependent manner. To further evaluate the surface structure of these biofilms, we performed hydrophobic analysis, which demonstrated that LCEE (fruit) reduced the hydrophobicity of the bacterial surface structure. Our data demonstrated that LCEE (fruit) had anti-bacterial and anti-biofilm effects on S. pyogenes in vitro, suggesting that the direct anti-bacterial effects of the LCEE (fruit) may be useful for treatment of local S. pyogenes infection. ? 2019, International Advancement Center for Medicine and Health Research Co., Ltd.",Anti-bacterial effect; anti-biofilm effect; Emphyllocalyx; Fruit; Lonicera caerulea var; Streptococcus pyogenes,"antiinfective agent; methanol; plant extract; biofilm; chemical phenomena; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; fruit; growth, development and aging; Lonicera; microbial sensitivity test; physiology; plant leaf; plant stem; Streptococcus pyogenes; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Biofilms; Fruit; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Lonicera; Methanol; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Plant Stems; Streptococcus pyogenes",2-s2.0-85066056845

Although optical coherence tomography (OCT) is essential for ophthalmologists, reading of findings requires expertise. The purpose of this study is to test deep learning with image augmentation for automated detection of chorioretinal diseases. Methods. A retina specialist diagnosed 1,200 OCT images. The diagnoses involved normal eyes (n=570) and those with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (n=136), diabetic retinopathy (DR) (n=104), epiretinal membranes (ERMs) (n=90), and another 19 diseases. Among them, 1,100 images were used for deep learning training, augmented to 59,400 by horizontal flipping, rotation, and translation. The remaining 100 images were used to evaluate the trained convolutional neural network (CNN) model. Results. Automated disease detection showed that the first candidate disease corresponded to the doctor's decision in 83 (83%) images and the second candidate disease in seven (7%) images. The precision and recall of the CNN model were 0.85 and 0.97 for normal eyes, 1.00 and 0.77 for wet AMD, 0.78 and 1.00 for DR, and 0.75 and 0.75 for ERMs, respectively. Some of rare diseases such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease were correctly detected by image augmentation in the CNN training. Conclusion. Automated detection of macular diseases from OCT images might be feasible using the CNN model. Image augmentation might be effective to compensate for a small image number for training. ? 2019 Soichiro Kuwayama et al.",,,2-s2.0-85065644850

We aimed to investigate the e?ect of statins on these variables in patients with T2DM and hypercholesterolemia. A control group comprising 24 patients with T2DM but without hypercholesterolemia was observed for more than 12 weeks, while 24 patients with T2DM and hypercholesterolemia were treated with statins for the same period (statin group). The percentage changes in the glycemic status [blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c)], and levels of plasma adiponectin [total and high molecular weight (HMW)] were compared between the two groups. The statin group had reduced percentage changes in HbA1c, blood glucose, and total and HMW-adiponectin concentration percentage changes that were similar to those in the control group. However, when matched for sex, age (±5 years) and HbA1c (± 0.5%) with the control group, the pravastatin group had reduced percentage changes in the plasma HMW-adiponectin concentrations than the matched controls (p=0.023). However, there were no differences in the percentage changes in the plasma total adiponectin (p=0.137), HbA1c (p=0.202), or blood glucose concentrations (p=0.450) between the two groups. Pravastatin treatment had no effect on the glycemic status of patients with T2DM and hypercholesterolemia, but may reduce the percentage changes in the plasma HMW-adiponectin concentrations. Hence, patients with T2DMand hypercholesterolemia receiving long-term treatment with pravastatin might experience increased insulin resistance. ? 2019 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Adiponectin; Pravastatin; Statin; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,"adiponectin; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; cholesterol; dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; metformin; pioglitazone; pravastatin; sulfonylurea; triacylglycerol; adiponectin; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; pravastatin; adult; aged; Article; body mass; clinical article; controlled study; diet therapy; drug activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; exercise; female; follow up; glucose blood level; glycemic control; hospitalization; human; hypercholesterolemia; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; lifestyle modification; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; prospective study; blood; complication; glucose blood level; hypercholesterolemia; metabolism; middle aged; molecular weight; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Adiponectin; Aged; Blood Glucose; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hypercholesterolemia; Insulin Resistance; Male; Middle Aged; Molecular Weight; Pravastatin",2-s2.0-85065644398

It has been used successfully in the USA following its Food and Drug Administration approval in 2001. However, the technology was not approved for use in Japan until 2017. Cystoscopy and urine cytology are the most frequently used examinations to detect bladder cancer in Japan, and there are only a few reports regarding the performance of UroVysion. Therefore, the aim of this study is to examine the diagnostic accuracy of UroVysion FISH in Japanese patients whose tumors are detected by cystoscopy before transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Methods: From April 2018 to July 2018, a total of 40 patients who were diagnosed as having bladder tumors by cystoscopy, and therefore underwent TURBT were registered in this study. One day before TURBT, urine cytology and UroVysion FISH were used in order to compare the accuracy with which they could detect bladder carcinoma, as confirmed by pathological results of TURBT. Results: The pathological results of TURBT showed urothelial carcinoma in 33 cases. Urine cytology showed positive results for 0 cases (0%), suspicious results for 10 cases (30.3%), and negative results for 23 cases (69.7%). On the other hand, UroVysion FISH indicated 9 positive cases (27.3%) and 24 negative cases (72.7%). There were 19 cases of urothelial carcinoma (57.6%) that were not detected by either method. Conclusion: We conclude that UroVysion FISH alone is insufficient to detect bladder cancer and that cystoscopy is essential for the optimum detection or follow up of bladder cancer cases in our hospital. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.",Cystoscopy; Cytology; FISH; Urinary bladder carcinoma,"adult; aged; bladder tumor; chemistry; cystoscopy; cytodiagnosis; cytology; diagnostic kit; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; follow up; human; male; middle aged; predictive value; procedures; receiver operating characteristic; urine; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cystoscopy; Cytodiagnosis; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic; ROC Curve; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Urine",2-s2.0-85065439650

These vaccines induce and activate proliferation of TAA-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), suppressing tumor growth. The therapeutic efficacy of TAA-specific CTLs depends on the properties of tumor microenvironment. The environments make immunosuppressive by function of regulatory T cells and tumor-associated myeloid cells; thus, regulation of these cells is important for successful cancer immunotherapy. We report here that L-ergothioneine (EGT) with the adjuvant Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) ligand modulated suppressive microenvironments to be immune-enhancing. EGT did not augment DC-mediated CTL priming or affect CTL activation in draining lymph node and spleen. However, EGT decreased the immuno-suppressive function of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). TLR2 stimulation accompanied with EGT administration downregulated expression of PD-L1, CSF-1R, arginase-1, FAS ligand, and TRAIL in TAMs, reflecting reduction of CTL suppression. An anti-oxidative thiol-thione residue of EGT was essential to dampening CTL suppression. The effect was specific to the thiol-thione residue of EGT because no effect was observed with another anti-oxidant N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC). A CTL-suppressive environment made by TLR2 is relieved to be improved by the addition of EGT, which may ameliorate the efficacy of vaccine immunotherapy. ? 2019 Yoshida, Shime, Matsumoto, Kasahara and Seya.",Cytotoxic T lymphocyte; L-ergothioneine; Toll-like receptor; Tumor microenvironment; Tumor-associated macrophage,,2-s2.0-85065316631

We performed video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)segmentectomy and could achieve a complete resection that is minimally invasive and oncologically sufficient. Presentation of case: An 82-year-old woman was found to have a nodule in the left anterior segment of the lung on chest computed tomography (CT). The nodule was 1.9 cm in size and strongly suspected to be lung carcinoma. No suspicious regions of metastasis were observed; thus, we diagnosed stage IA2 and decided to perform anterior and lingular segmentectomy by VATS. Discussion: Because of the location, the tumor is traditionally resected by left upper lobectomy. However, we planned a minimally invasive intervention and performed anterior and lingular segmentectomy by VATS using a CT-guided nodule marking prior to the surgery. Conclusion: This technique resulted in complete tumor resection with minimal adverse effects. ? 2019 The Author(s)",Minimally invasive surgery; Segmentectomy; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery,aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer staging; cancer surgery; case report; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; female; histopathology; human; lingular segmentectomy; lung carcinoma; lung nodule; lung resection; maximum standardized uptake value; medical history; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; operation duration; positron emission tomography; priority journal; segmentectomy; surgical margin; surgical patient; very elderly; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery,2-s2.0-85065292541

Methods: Electrocardiographically synchronized singleshot diffusion echo-planer imaging (b = 0, 500, and 1000 s/mm2) was performed in healthy volunteers, atrophic ventricular dilation group, and iNPH group, respectively. The ΔADC (b = 0 and 1000 s/mm2) and maximum ADC (b = 0 and 500 s/mm2) in the cardiac cycles were measured at the frontal white matter in the brain. Then, self-corrected ΔADC was obtained from the ΔADC divided by the maximum ADC (ADCpeak: Perfusion-related diffusion) to correct the blood flow effect. Results: The ΔADC after correction was significantly higher in the iNPH group than in the other two groups. However, there was no significant difference in ADCpeak values among the groups. Conclusion: Self-corrected ΔADC in iNPH increased because of changes in the biomechanical properties of the brain. Self-corrected ΔADC analysis makes it possible to obtain information on hemodynamically independent water fluctuation as well as perfusion in iNPH. Advances in knowledge: Analysis self-corrected ΔADC provides simultaneously information on biomechanical properties, perfusion, and water fluctuation in iNPH. ? 2019 The Authors.",,"aged; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; blood flow; brain atrophy; clinical article; controlled study; electrocardiography; female; heart cycle; heart hemodynamics; human; male; neuroimaging; normotensive hydrocephalus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; white matter; brain; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; hemodynamics; normotensive hydrocephalus; pathophysiology; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Brain; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Electrocardiography; Female; Hemodynamics; Humans; Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure; Male",2-s2.0-85064992131

Coadministration of calcium channel blockers (CCBs) might affect the study results. Methods: In this subanalysis, 20 patients with chronic kidney disease (14 men; age 61±15 years) were divided into three groups: patients with coadministration of L-type CCB, patients without coadministration of CCB, and patients with coadministration of sympathoinhibitory (L/T- or L/T/N-type) CCB. λ25s was calculated separately in daytime and nighttime. Results: Daytime λ25s at baseline was higher in patients with L-type CCB coadministration (0.62±0.18, n = 5) compared with those without CCB (0.49±0.13, n = 11) and those with sympathoinhibitory CCB (0.46±0.06, n = 4). The relationship between the changes in daytime λ25s and systolic blood pressure was positive in patients with L-type CCB coadministration, whereas the relationship was inverse in the other two groups. A larger decrease in daytime λ25s was shown in patients with L-type CCB coadministration compared with those in the other two groups. Conclusions: CCBs, as well as diuretics, are recommended as second-line antihypertensive agents. Our results suggested that ARBs can overwhelm the activation of sympathetic nerve activity stimulated by coadministration of L-type CCBs. ?

However, adrenal function at each developmental stage has not fully been investigated in relation to pathological antenatal conditions. Cortisol levels of newborns with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are elevated during the neonatal period; however, when studied during early childhood, cortisol levels are reduced compared with their peers, suggesting that the HPA axis regulation might be altered from activation to suppression, the timing of which remains uncertain. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the presence of an interaction between intrauterine growth and postnatal age on cortisol levels in newborns hospitalised at a neonatal intensive care unit. Methods: We performed a secondary analysis using a dataset from saliva samples of 62 newborns collected between 30 and 40 weeks corrected age. Interactions between postnatal age and clinical variables with regard to cortisol levels were assessed. Results: The z-score of the birth weight and IUGR showed significant interactions with postnatal age on cortisol levels; cortisol levels were higher 5 days of birth and lower >14 days of birth than those in their peers without IUGR. Conclusion: The adrenal function of newborns with IUGR might be altered from activation to suppression within the first several weeks of life. Longitudinal studies need to address when/how IUGR alters adrenal functions, and how these responses are associated with diseases during adulthood. ? 2019 Iwata et al.",Hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis; Intrauterine growth restriction; Placental 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2; Preterm infant; Salivary cortisol,adrenal function; Article; artificial ventilation; assisted ventilation; birth weight; breast feeding; chorioamnionitis; chromosome aberration; cohort analysis; congenital malformation; cross-sectional study; enzyme immunoassay; gestational age; human; hydrocortisone blood level; hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism; intrauterine growth retardation; lactation; major clinical study; maturation; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; observational study; phototherapy; physiological stress; premature labor; prenatal growth; tocolysis,2-s2.0-85063621324

The number of large population-based studies examining predictors for VTE has been limited, and there has been no study based on a Japanese population. Objective Our objective was to examine VTE risk factor during the pregnancy and post-partum period. Materials and Methods A nationwide birth cohort study known as the 'Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS)' was conducted by the Ministry of the Environment. The subjects consisted of 103,070 pregnancies recruited by the JECS between January 2011 and March 2014. Pregnant women completed the questionnaires during the first and second/third trimester. Their medical records were transcribed by physicians or research coordinators at registration, just after delivery and at 1 month after delivery. Results The frequency of VTE was 7.5 per 10,000 pregnancies (77 of 103,070) during the pregnancy and post-partum period. After the adjustment of multiple covariates for each factor, endometriosis and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) were identified as novel independent risk factors for VTE. Adjusted odds ratios were as follows: 2.70 (95% confidence interval, 1.21-6.00) for endometriosis and 6.13 (2.48-15.16) for RPL. Threatened abortion, threatened pre-term birth, pre-term birth and caesarean section were ascertained to be risk factors for VTE. Conclusion Careful attention should be given to novel predictors, such as endometriosis and a history of RPL, to prevent VTE during the pregnancy and post-partum period. ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart New York.",birth cohort study; post-partum; pregnancy; recurrent pregnancy loss; venous thromboembolism,"low molecular weight heparin; adult; Article; birth injury; body height; body mass; body weight; cesarean section; cohort analysis; ectopic pregnancy; embryo transfer; endometriosis; female; gynecologic disease; human; imminent abortion; in vitro fertilization; lifestyle; maternal mortality; medical history; metritis; multiple pregnancy; oligohydramnios; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; pregnancy disorder; premature labor; priority journal; puerperium; pulmonary hypertension; questionnaire; recurrent abortion; risk factor; smoking; solutio placentae; spontaneous abortion; stillbirth; venous thromboembolism; adverse event; complication; endometriosis; Japan; male; maternal age; newborn; prematurity; recurrent abortion; risk factor; venous thromboembolism; Abortion, Habitual; Abortion, Threatened; Adult; Cesarean Section; Cohort Studies; Endometriosis; Female; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Male; Maternal Age; Postpartum Period; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Complications, Cardiovascular; Premature Birth; Risk Factors; Surveys and Questionnaires; Venous Thromboembolism",2-s2.0-85063196518

We aimed to clarify the role of surgery for pNEN-G3, which has recently been reclassified as pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor-G3 (pNET-G3) and pancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma-G3 (pNEC-G3), with and without metastases, respectively. Methods: We analyzed a subgroup of patients from the Japanese pancreatic NEC study, a Japanese multicenter case-series study of pNEN-G3. Pathologists subclassified 67 patients as having pNET-G3 or pNEC-G3 based on morphological features. We compared the overall survival (OS) rates among patients who were grouped according to whether they had undergone tumor-targeted surgery for tumors without (SwoM) or with (SwM) metastases, or non-surgical procedures (NS). Results: Data from 21 patients with pNET-G3 (SwoM, n = 6; SwM, n = 5; NS, n = 10) and 46 patients with pNEC-G3 (SwoM, n = 8; SwM, n = 5; NS, n = 33) were analyzed. OS of patients with pNET-G3 was significantly longer after SwoM and SwM than with NS (p = 0.018 and p = 0.022). In contrast, OS did not significantly differ between either SwoM or SwM and NS (p = 0.093 and p = 0.489) among patients with pNEC-G3. Conclusion: The role of surgery should be considered separately for pNET-G3 and pNEC-G3. Although SwoM and SwM can be considered for pNET-G3, caution is advised before considering SwM and SwoM for pNEC-G3. ? 2019, Society of Surgical Oncology.",,"adult; aged; cancer staging; carcinoma; female; follow up; human; male; metastasis; middle aged; mortality; neuroendocrine tumor; pancreas tumor; pancreatectomy; pathology; survival rate; tumor invasion; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Neuroendocrine; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Invasiveness; Neoplasm Metastasis; Neoplasm Staging; Neuroendocrine Tumors; Pancreatectomy; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85062998791

Materials and Methods Data were retrospectively reviewed from consecutive patients with distal stage II/III CRC who underwent surgery between January 2007 and December 2011 at two Japanese hospitals. One hospital conducted emergency surgery and the other performed TCT placement as the standard treatment for all CRCs with ACO. Propensity score (PS) matching was used to adjust baseline characteristics between two groups. Results Among 754 patients with distal stage II/III CRC, 680 did not have ACO (non-ACO group) and 74 had ACO (ACO group). The PS matching between both hospitals identified 234 pairs in the non-ACO group and 23 pairs in the ACO group. In the non-ACO group, the surgical quality was equivalent between the two institutions, with no significant differences in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). In the ACO group, the rate of primary resection/anastomosis was higher in the TCT group than in the surgery group (87.0% vs. 26.1%, p < 0.001). No significant differences were noted between the surgery and the TCT groups in OS (5-year OS, 61.9% vs. 51.5%; p=0.490) and DFS (5-year DFS, 45.9% vs. 38.3%; p=0.658). Conclusion TCT placement can achieve similar long-term outcomes to emergency surgery, with a high rate of primary resection/anastomosis for distal stage II/III colon cancer with ACO.

However, it is difficult to register pseudo-CT images to cone-beam CT (CBCT) images collected for image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), because of the lack of contrasts among tissues. We validated gaps of IGRT between pseudo-CT or planning CT and CBCT for patients without implanted markers. We also propose calcification-assisted registration for MR-only simulation. We conducted retrospective analyses to verify the registration accuracy in 15 patients who underwent volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) for prostate cancer. They underwent planning CT and pseudo-CT. Pseudo-CT images after deformable image registration (DIR) to planning CT images were rendered automatic pelvic bone matching to CBCT images. Patient positions on the pseudo-CT images after DIR were shifted on the basis of tissues around the prostate. We compared registration gaps between the images of planning CT and pseudo-CT with DIR, assuming that the tissue-based matching between the planning CT and CBCT was the gold standard. To the pseudo-CT images with DIR, calcifications detected on planning CT were added. We validated IGRT accuracy for a calcification-assisted registration. The absolute registration errors of the pseudo-CT, in comparison with the planning CT, were 0.34 ± 0.50 (lateral), 1.3 ± 1.3 (longitudinal), and 1.1 ± 1.0 mm (vertical). The absolute registration errors of the pseudo-CT with calcification contouring, in comparison with the planning CT, were 0.41 ± 1.0 (lateral), 0.87 ± 0.92 (longitudinal), and 0.74 ± 0.64 mm (vertical). Reduced absolute registration errors were observed in the proposed approach in the longitudinal (P < 0.01) and vertical (P < 0.01) dimensions when using calcification-assisted registration. The tissue-based registration using the MR-only simulation was not sufficient for use in patients with prostate cancer without implanted markers. The calcification-assisted registration might help to improve IGRT accuracy using MRI alone. ? 2019 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",carcifcation-assisted registration; prostate cancer; Pseudo-CT,"Biomineralization; Bone; Diseases; Errors; Histology; Radiotherapy; Tissue; Urology; carcifcation-assisted registration; Deformable image registration; Image-guided radiation therapy; Prostate cancers; Registration accuracy; Registration error; Retrospective analysis; Volumetric modulated arc therapy; Computerized tomography; aged; calcinosis; cone beam computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; fiducial marker; human; image guided radiotherapy; intensity modulated radiation therapy; male; middle aged; procedures; prostate tumor; radiotherapy planning system; retrospective study; Aged; Calcinosis; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Fiducial Markers; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prostatic Neoplasms; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Image-Guided; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85062630073

Although LSD1 and c-Myc are both strongly expressed in human cancers, the mechanisms by which their activities are coordinated remain unclear. We herein demonstrated that LSD1 is a direct target gene of c-Myc. The knockdown of c-Myc decreased the expression of LSD1 in several cancer cell lines. We identified two non-canonical Eboxes in the proximal promoter region of the LSD1 gene. A chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed that c-Myc bound to these E-boxes in the LSD1 promoter. Importantly, LSD1 mRNA expression correlated with c-Myc expression in human acute myeloid leukemia (AML), glioblastoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and prostate adenocarcinoma.

Therefore, augmentation of Reelin activity may ameliorate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We have recently reported that a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 3 (ADAMTS-3) cleaves and inactivates Reelin in the mouse brain. In the present study, we investigated the effect of reducing ADAMTS-3 on deposition of Aβ by crossbreeding drug-inducible ADAMTS-3 conditional knock-out (cKO) mice with “next-generation” AD model mice. We found that reducing ADAMTS-3 inhibited deposition of Aβ significantly in App NL - F mice, which produce human wild-type Aβ. On the other hand, reducing ADAMTS-3 had no effect in App NL -G-F mice, which produce the Arctic mutant Aβ (E22G) that forms protofibrils more efficiently than does wild-type Aβ. Thus, the findings suggest that the administration of an inhibitor against ADAMTS-3 will prevent the progression of AD pathology caused by deposition of wild-type Aβ. ? 2019 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan",Alzheimer’s disease; Knock-in mouse; Metalloprotease; Reelin,"ADAMTS 3 protein; ADAMTS protein; amyloid beta protein; reelin; unclassified drug; amyloid beta protein; amyloid precursor protein; APP protein, human; nerve cell adhesion molecule; nerve protein; reelin protein; scleroprotein; serine proteinase; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; female; gene knock-in; infant; male; mouse; nonhuman; pathogenesis; protein cleavage; protein degradation; protein deposition; Alzheimer disease; animal; disease model; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; knockout mouse; metabolism; transgenic mouse; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Animals; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Disease Models, Animal; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Serine Endopeptidases",2-s2.0-85062413621

Aim: To elucidate the antiviral mechanisms of a human microRNA, miR-302c-3p, against HBV replication. Methods: The antiviral effect of miR-302c-3p was evaluated in vitro and in vivo by transfecting the miR-302c-3p mimic into HBV-infected HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells and HBV transgenic mice respectively. Results: miR-302c-3p decreased not only HBV replication but also production of HBsAg. Pregenomic RNA and HBsAg mRNA concentrations decreased in the cells treated with miR-302c-3p. Interestingly, the amount of cccDNA was significantly reduced in the miR-302c-3p-treated cells, in association with disappearance of the HBV core protein. An RNA immunoprecipitation assay showed that miR-302c-3p decreased the binding of the HBV polymerase to the pregenomic RNA by hybridising with the ε-loop region. A number of host genes were downregulated in miR-302c-3p-treated cells, including BMPR2 and HNF4A. Knockdown of these two genes by corresponding siRNAs also suppressed HBV replication and HBsAg secretion. The antiviral effect of miR-302c-3p was also observed in HBV transgenic mice.

The general treatment of S. pyogenes infection is by using β-lactam antibiotics; however, the cases of treatment failure were increasing as serious problems. Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx (LCE) has been used in the folk medicine in the northern part of Japan, the northern part of China, Korea, and Russia. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of three parts (fruit, stem, and leaf) of Lonicera caerulea var. emphyllocalyx extract (LCEEs) against murine S. pyogenes infection. Oral administration of LCEEs increased the mortality in murine model, and the extracts of its stems and leaves were more effective than the fruit extract significantly. Murine splenocytes and mesenteric lymph nodal cells treated with LCEEs suppressed the excess production of inflammatory cytokine such as TNF-α in comparison to those from untreated cells. LCEEs stimulated the differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells in those murine lymph nodal cells. It also activated the proliferative response of murine lymph nodal cells. We also found that the stem and leaf extracts seemed to be more effective than the fruit extract in those phenomena. The concentration of lignins in LCEE prepared from the stems was larger than that from leaves, and that was larger than that from the fruits.

Case Report: A 40-year-old female was referred to our hospital for further investigation of a pancreatic cyst. Further examination showed a 7.0 cm multilocular cyst in the pancreatic tail and a solid mass in the thick septum of the cystic tumor. Distal pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed. Histological examination revealed a moderately differentiated invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) with a diameter of 0.5 cm in the thick septum of the cystic lesion and a cyst wall composed of epithelium with low-grade to severe dysplasia. The epithelium covered an OS. Pathological diagnosis was IDC arising in MCN of the pancreas. Immunohistochemical examination showed that MUC1 expression was negative in MCN but positive in IDC.

Nine healthy, active individuals with different levels of cycling experience exercised at a power output equal to T vent , pedaling at cadences of 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 and 90 rpm, each for 4 min. Cadences were tested in a randomized counterbalanced sequence. Cardiopulmonary and metabolic responses were studied using an ECG for heart rate, and gas calorimetry for pulmonary oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide production. NIRS was used to determine the tissue saturation index (TSI), a measure of vastus lateralis oxygenation. TSI decreased from rest to exercise; the magnitude of this TSI reduction was significantly greater when pedaling at 90 rpm (-14±4%), compared to pedaling at 40 (-12±3%) and 50 (-12±3%) rpm (P=0.027 and 0.017, respectively). Albeit small, the significant decrease in ΔTSI at increased cadence recorded in this study suggests that skeletal muscle oxygenation is relatively more affected by high cadence when exercise intensity is close to T vent . ? 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York.",cadence; cycling; exercise; muscle; near-infrared spectroscopy; oxygen; tissue saturation index,"lactic acid; adult; blood; cycling; female; heart rate; human; male; middle aged; oxygen consumption; physiology; skeletal muscle; young adult; Adult; Bicycling; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Lactic Acid; Male; Middle Aged; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Consumption; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85061631834

We investigated the association between fiber intake and the risk of HNC using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) cancer screening trial. Among 101,700 participants with complete dietary information, 186 participants developed HNC during follow-up (January 1998 to May 2011). Dietary data were collected using a self-administered food-frequency questionnaire (1998–2005). We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI), using the Cox proportional hazards model. Higher intake of total fiber, insoluble fiber and soluble fiber was associated with decreased HNC risks, with a significant trend. The HRs of highest vs. the lowest tertile of intake were 0.43 (95%CI: 0.25–0.76) for total fiber, 0.38 (95%CI: 0.22–0.65) for insoluble fiber, and 0.44 (95%CI: 0.25–0.79) for soluble fiber. These inverse association were consistent in oral cavity and pharyngeal cases, but the impact of fiber intake was weaker in laryngeal cases. We did not observe any significant interaction of potential confounders, including smoking and drinking, with total fiber intake on HNC risk.

Methods: We assessed 17 elderly patients with persistent air leak who received talc pleurodesis for secondary pneumothorax from April 2013 to March 2017. Thoracoscopic talc poudrage (TTP) (n=11) was performed in patients whose general condition was thought to sufficiently stable to tolerate for general anesthesia. Talc slurry pleurodesis (TSP) (n=6) via a chest tube was performed in patients whose general condition was thought to be insufficiently stable to tolerate general anesthesia. Results: The median drainage period after pleurodesis was 6 days in patients who received TTP and 12 days in patients who received TSP. Complications associated with talc pleurodesis included atrial fibrillation (n=1) in the thoracoscopic poudrage group, while the slurry pleurodesis group showed chest pain (n=2), asthmatic attack (n=1), and pneumonia (n=1). All patients who received thoracoscopic poudrage were able to leave the hospital after removal of the chest tube. Five of the six patients who received slurry pleurodesis were able to leave the hospital, but one of them died of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia (IP) on the 45th day after pleurodesis. The success rate was 94% (16/17). There were no cases of recurrence during the observation period. Conclusions: TTP was deemed likely to be safe and effective for patients able to tolerate general anesthesia. In patients with IP, especially those treated with steroids, the indication of talc pleurodesis should be cautiously considered. ? Journal of Thoracic Disease.

This study aimed to examine the effects of two weight-loss programs for male workers aged 18-39 that combined different intensities of human support with website support compared to a delayed-intervention group (control group; CG), in a randomized controlled trial. Methods: Seventy-one participants with overweight or obesity were allocated to one of three 12-week treatment programs. The Standard Support Group (SSG) was provided support via website and two face-to-face group guidance sessions, at the beginning and at the end of the program along with monthly general emails throughout the program. The Enhanced Support Group (ESG) received four remote support sessions based on Supportive Accountability (SA) in addition to the SSG. The CG was provided the same program as SSG after the other two groups had completed the program. The primary outcome was body weight reduction. Results: ESG participants reduced their weight significantly more than SSG and CG participants (P = 0.038, P < 0.001, respectively), and SSG participants reduced their weight significantly more than CG participants (P = 0.033). Conclusions: The additional remote human support provided to the participants in the ESG was beneficial for weight loss in male workers. The low-intensity program provided to the SSG was also effective. Further studies with more participants in diverse settings and with participants who are less interested in their health and weight management are needed. ? 2019 Japan Society for Occupational Health.",Human support; Randomized controlled trial; Supportive Accountability; Web-based intervention; Weight loss,adult; analysis of variance; body mass; body weight; body weight loss; controlled study; human; Internet; Japan; male; obesity; psychology; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; social support; young adult; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Humans; Internet; Japan; Male; Overweight; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Weight Loss; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85060806810

This review aims to clarify the 2EH characteristics as an indoor air pollutant such as indoor air concentration, emission mechanism, toxicity, and clinical effects. Methods: Scientific publications in English that has been made available on PubMed as of June 2018 and ad hoc publications in regional languages were reviewed. Results: Inhalation exposure to 2EH caused mucous membrane irritation in the eyes, nose, and throat in experimental animals. Studies in human volunteers revealed an increase in olfactory irritation and eye discomfort. There has been increasing evidence of 2EH being present in indoor air in buildings. The primary sources of 2EH emissions are not building materials themselves, but instead the hydrolysis of plasticizers and flooring adhesives. In particular, compounds like di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate present in polyvinyl chloride flooring materials are hydrolyzed upon contact with alkaline moisture-containing concrete floors. That being said, it may be observed that indoor concentrations of 2EH increased every year during summer. Conclusions: Unlike other volatile organic compounds that cause SBS, 2EH can be retained in indoor air for long durations, increasing the likelihood of causing undesirable health effects in building occupants exposed to it. As a precautionary measure, it is important to use flooring materials that do not emit 2EH by hydrolysis, or to dry concrete before covering with flooring materials. ? 2019 Japan Society for Occupational Health.",2-ethyl-1-hexanol; Emission mechanism; Indoor air pollution; Indoor concentration; Sick building syndrome; Volatile organic compounds,"2-ethylhexanol; hexanol; plasticizer; adverse device effect; air pollutant; animal; building; building material; disease model; exposure; human; indoor air pollution; mouse; oral drug administration; rat; Administration, Oral; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Animals; Construction Materials; Disease Models, Animal; Floors and Floorcoverings; Hexanols; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Mice; Plasticizers; Rats",2-s2.0-85060786151

In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial and the anticancer activity of the Moringa peregrina as well as Moringa oleifera leaves extracts grown locally in Egypt. Results indicated that most of the extracts were found to possess high antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, gram-negative bacteria, and fungus. The survival rate of cancer cells was decreased in both hepatocellular carcinoma (HepG2) and breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cell lines when treated with Moringa leaves extracts. In addition, the cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and cancer-related genes confirmed its anticancer effect. The toxicity of each extract was also tested using the normal melanocytes cell line HFB4. The toxicity was low in both Moringa peregrina and Moringa oleifera leaves extracts. Furthermore, GC/MS analysis fractionized the phytochemicals content for each potential extract. In conclusion, results suggested that the Moringa peregrina and Moringa oleifera leaves extracts possess antimicrobial and anticancer properties which could be attributed to the bioactive phytochemical compounds present inside the extracts from this plant.

Proton pump inhibitor (PPI) is a useful drug in the treatment of LPR, but its effect on hypogeusia is not known. We therefore assessed the effects of PPI or a histamine H2 receptor antagonist (H2 blocker) on hypogeusia among patients with LPR. Both PPI and H2 blocker could inhibit acid reflux. LPR was diagnosed with reflux finding score and reflux symptom index. The visual analogue scale (VAS) of taste disturbance symptoms and the gustatory tests were assessed before and 8 weeks after treatment with esomeprazole, a PPI (20 patients, aged 50.0 ± 1.7 years) or famotidine, a H2 blocker (20 patients, aged 47.1 ± 1.8 years). There were no significant differences in VAS scores and recognition thresholds for four basic tastes between the two groups before treatment. Only PPI therapy significantly decreased the VAS scores, suggesting the improvement of taste perception. Moreover, PPI therapy significantly decreased recognition thresholds for bitter taste in the anterior tongue (chorda tympani nerve area) and the thresholds in the posterior tongue (glossopharyngeal nerve area) for salty, sour, and bitter tastes. By contrast, H2-blocker therapy caused no significant changes of thresholds in the anterior tongue, but improved the threshold only for bitter in the posterior tongue, the value of which was however significantly higher than that in PPI group. In conclusion, PPI could ameliorate hypogeusia by improving bitter, salty, and sour tastes among patients with LPR. ? 2018 Tohoku University Medical Press.",Gastroesophageal reflux disease; Gustation test; Histamine H2 receptor antagonist; Proton pump inhibitor; Taste disturbance,esomeprazole; famotidine; proton pump inhibitor; adult; Article; bitter taste; causal attribution; chorda tympani; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; glossopharyngeal nerve; human; hypogeusia; Japanese (people); laryngopharyngeal reflux; male; randomized controlled trial; saltiness; sex difference; taste acuity; taste discrimination; treatment duration; treatment outcome; visual analog scale; aged; drug effect; laryngopharyngeal reflux; middle aged; pain measurement; pathophysiology; perceptive threshold; taste; Adult; Aged; Chorda Tympani Nerve; Female; Glossopharyngeal Nerve; Humans; Laryngopharyngeal Reflux; Male; Middle Aged; Pain Measurement; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Sensory Thresholds; Taste,2-s2.0-85060009522

In premenopausal women, expression of estrogen-regulated genes in estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer tissues are reportedly influenced by the menstrual cycle. Methods: We investigated correlations between serum estradiol (E2; tested on the day of surgery) and expression of estrogen-regulated genes and proliferation genes in strongly estrogen receptor α-positive breast cancer tissues from 91 premenopausal women by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. We also investigated correlations between serum progesterone levels on the day of surgery and mRNA expression of progesterone-regulated genes and proliferation genes. Results: The serum E2 level affected expression of estrogen-regulated genes, including progesterone receptor (P = 0.016, Rs = 0.07) but showed no correlation with expression of genes associated with proliferation. We also observed strong positive correlations between mRNA expression of ESR1 and that of estrogen-regulated genes (P < 0.0001, Rs = 0.329–0.756) and proliferation genes (P < 0.0001, Rs = 0.753–0.843). The serum progesterone level affected expression of RANKL mRNA. However, we observed no correlations between serum progesterone and expression of Wnt-4 or proliferation genes. Conclusions: The serum E2 level on the day of surgery influences estrogen-regulated gene expression moderately in patients found to be strongly positive for estrogen receptor α by immunohistochemistry. Changes in serum E2 levels might influence the results of molecular profiling tests in premenopausal women with breast cancer. ? The Author(s) 2018. Published by Oxford University Press.

This study sought to clarify the appropriate communication style for physicians as perceived by family members confronting difficult surrogate decision-making. Methods: This experimental psychological study used scripted videos. In the videos, the physician described treatment options including continuous deep sedation to the family members of patients with cancer and terminal delirium using an autonomous or paternalistic style. Medical professionals with clinical experience in oncology were randomly assigned to either group viewing the videos. The primary outcomes were physician compassion, decisional conflict and emotion scores. We also evaluated the communication style preference. Results: In total, 251 participants completed this study. Although participants in both groups reported high physician compassion, participants in the autonomous style group reported lower compassion scores (reflecting higher physician compassion) (mean 15.0 vs. 17.3, P = 0.050), lower decisional conflicts scores (51.1 vs. 56.8, P = 0.002) and comparable emotions compared with those in the paternalistic style group. Seventy-six percent of participants preferred the autonomous style. Conclusions: Regarding difficult surrogate decision-making, the autonomous style might be more appropriate than the paternalistic style. However, various factors, such as family members’ communication style preferences, family members’ values, physician–family relationships and ethnic cultures, should be considered. ?

Thus, this study aimed to clarify the effects of authoritarian and permissive parenting on children’s externalizing and internalizing behaviors during the preschool-to-elementary-school transition according to gender in Japan. A sample of 1668 Japanese children (853 boys and 815 girls) were followed longitudinally over one-year intervals, and assessed based on parenting styles (the Parenting Scale), children’s behavioral problems (the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), and family characteristics. Multivariate analyses revealed that, when analyzed by gender, authoritarian discipline influenced externalizing problems in boys (β = 0.048, p = 0.047) and girls (β = 0.067, p = 0.023), while permissive discipline influenced externalizing problems in boys only (β = 0.049, p = 0.038). The results document the relationship between family processes and the development of disruptive behavior disorders in children. Support for parents employing such child-rearing styles in early childhood may be effective in reducing school maladjustment. ? 2018 by the authors.

This retrospective investigation sought to clarify the risk factors for stone formation in type 1 AIP. Methods Questionnaires on patients with type 1 AIP were sent to 22 high-volume medical centers across Japan to compare the clinical features of patients with and without pancreatic stone formation. Results Of the completed records on 624 type 1 AIP patients, 31 (5%) had experienced pancreatic stones. Median follow-up duration was 1853 days. Bentiromide test values at diagnosis were significantly lower, and hemoglobin A1c values after corticosteroid treatment were significantly higher in patients with pancreatic stones. Imaging results disclosed that pancreatic atrophy and hilar or intrahepatic bile duct stenosis were significantly more frequent in patients with pancreatic stone formation. Pancreatic head swelling tended to be more frequent in this group as well. On the other hand, a shorter follow-up period was associated with the nonformation of pancreatic stones. Conclusions The increased frequency of pancreatic head swelling in type 1 AIP patients exhibiting pancreatic stones indicated a propensity for pancreatic juice stasis with subsequent stone development and pancreatic dysfunction occurring over longer periods of disease duration. ?

To investigate whether these advances have been translated into continued improvement in glycemic control in Japanese children and adolescents, we analyzed the registration data of the two consecutive recent cohorts of Japanese childhood-onset T1DM patients. The registration data including hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ), hypoglycemia and insulin regimen were compared between the two cohorts (862 patients in the 2008 cohort and 1090 in the 2013 cohort). The proportion of subjects with multiple daily insulin injection therapy (MDI) and CSII significantly increased (p&lt;0.0001) from 67.4% and 9.7% to 71.8% and 23.4%, respectively. In the 2013 cohort, almost all patients were treated with basal-bolus treatment using insulin analogs. The use of CSII increased in all age groups, especially in the age group 0-5 years. The rates of overall, moderate and severe hypoglycemia significantly declined from 10.24, 10.18 and 0.056 events/100 persons/period in the 2008 cohort to 0.66, 0.62 and 0.033 in the 2013 cohort (p&lt;0.0001, &lt;0.0001, 0.04), respectively. Contrarily, there were no significant changes in HbA 1c values between the two cohorts. The popularization of the basal-bolus treatment using insulin analogs hascontributed to a significant decrease in hypoglycemia. In contrast, the intensive insulin treatment may not be enough for the satisfactory improvement of glycemic control in Japanese children and adolescents with T1DM.

Material and methods: 266 premenopausal patients with regular menstrual cycles from 24 centers were included, and 176 of them were diagnosed by pathology as having breast cancer. Thirty-five patients were examined in the menstrual phase (days 1–4), 105 in the proliferative phase (days 5–14), and 126 in the secretory phase (days 15–30). Measurement of the following signal intensities (SIs) were obtained: breast tissue on the unaffected side on a pre-contrast image (SI1) and an early-phase image (SI2); the SIs of breast tissue on the affected side on a pre-contrast image (SI3) and an early-phase image (SI4); and the SIs of breast cancer on a pre-contrast image (SI5) and an early-phase image (SI6). We calculated the BPE ratio, i.e., (SI2– SI1)/SI1 and the cancer/background enhancement ratio (C/B) ratio, i.e., (SI6– SI5) / (SI4– SI3). The BPE was classified as minimal, mild, moderate, or marked, and the cancer detectability was classified as excellent, good, or poor independently by two radiologists. Results: The average C/B ratio was 20.1, 15.7, and 9.1 at the menstrual, proliferative, and secretory phases (p &lt; 0.001). BPE was determined as moderate or marked in 0% and 5.4% at the menstrual phase, 10.3% and 11.0% at the proliferative phase, and 17.5% and 21.7% at the secretory phase by the two observers, respectively (p = 0.01, p = 0.01). The detectability of breast cancer was classified as poor in 0% and 0%, 1.4% and 13.0%, and 8.0% and 22.1% at the menstrual, proliferative, and secretory phases by the two observers, respectively (p = 0.07, p = 0.02). Conclusion: The menstrual phase and the proliferative phase seem to be suitable for breast MRI of Asian women. ? 2018",Background parenchymal enhancement; Breast; Menstrual cycle; MRI,adult; Article; Asian; breast cancer; breast carcinoma; breast tissue; cancer diagnosis; disease severity; dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging; female; follicular phase; histopathology; human; human tissue; image analysis; image enhancement; major clinical study; menstrual cycle; menstruation; middle aged; multicenter study; parenchyma; premenopause; priority journal; prospective study; radiologist; secretory phase; aged; Asia; breast; breast tumor; clinical trial; early cancer diagnosis; ethnology; menstrual cycle; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; physiology; procedures; young adult; contrast medium; Adult; Aged; Asia; Breast; Breast Neoplasms; Contrast Media; Early Detection of Cancer; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Menstrual Cycle; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85057341727

Although there are no published randomized controlled trials examining the effect of influenza vaccination on clinical outcomes in heart failure patients, the effect has been examined in observational cohort studies. Nevertheless, results are inconsistent due partly to limited power with small sample sizes and use of different definitions of outcomes. We therefore aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the effect of influenza vaccination on mortality and hospitalization in heart failure patients. The search of electronic databases identified 6 observational cohort studies with 22,486 patients examining the effect of influenza vaccination on mortality and hospitalization in heart failure patients. Pooled analysis of confounder-adjusted hazard ratio showed that influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of mortality during 1-year follow-up (risk ratio [95% CI] = 0.76 [0.63–0.92], P fix &lt; 0.01) and during long-term (up to 4?years) follow-up (0.80 [0.71–0.90], P fix &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of mortality during influenza season (risk ratio [95% CI] = 0.52 [0.39–0.69], P random &lt; 0.001) and during non-influenza season (0.79 [0.69–0.90], P fix &lt; 0.001).

In conclusion, our meta-analysis showed that influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of mortality in heart failure patients.

The flexible flat foot is seen in the overly flexible foot and usually involves hypermobility of the subtalar joint. It typically occurs in childhood and may continue to adulthood. The arch develops spontaneously during the first decade of life in most children and comes within the normal range observed in adult feet. We prescribed orthoses for the treatment of flexible flat foot patients. Lateral weight-bearing radiographs and ultrasonography were helpful for the evaluation of the flat foot. Bleck recommended the UCBL shoe insert in cases of flexible flat foot if the standing or lateral rentgenogram demonstrates a talar plantar flexion angle (TPF) of 45° or greater. Bordelon suggested that cases of flexible flat foot should be treated if the standing or lateral roentgenogram demonstrates a Meary's talo-1st metatarsal angle (T1-MTA) of ?15°or greater. However, the radiograph of a young child's foot poses some difficulties in making an accurate evaluation, because of the radiolucent cartilage zone. In this situation, a sagittal image obtained by ultrasonography has proved to be a powerful aid to evaluate the type of the flat foot. We classified the flat foot into three types: talo-navicular sag (T-N sag), naviculo-cuneiform sag (N–C sag) and talo-navicular and naviculo-cuneiform sag (Mixed sag) following the criteria of Tachdjian.

However, Japanese conventional studies have not shown enough statistical evidences. Hence, this study examined the relationship between perception of workforce diversity and mental health condition among Japanese nurses. Through the internet research, we collected a total of 1,031 valid data (male = 217, female = 814). This study constructed eighteen original items to assess the acceptance levels of diversity elements; seniority, managerial position, clinical experience, employment history, academic background, generation, gender, nationality, role orientation, employment pattern, license, personality, health condition, family situation, work and life priorities, hometown, nursing ability and work motivation. Each diversity element was evaluated by four acceptance levels; (1) refusing diversity (Resistance), (2) ignoring diversity (Assimilation), (3) valuing diversity (Separation) and (4) utilizing diversity (Integration). Mental health condition was assessed by the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12, high-stress ≧6 point). As the results of a logistic regression analysis, higher acceptance of the managerial position, personality and work and life priorities were negatively related with high-stress. Higher acceptance of the employment pattern and work motivation were positively related with high-stress. These results indicated that diversity management was one of the effective approaches to improve mental health condition among Japanese working nurses. ?

Subjects/methods: We conducted a series of case-control studies between 1985 and 2007 in Italy. The studies included a total of 1475 cases of cancer of the oral cavity and pharynx, 1077 of the larynx, 716 of the esophagus, 999 of the stomach, 684 of the liver, 159 of the biliary tract, 688 of the pancreas, and a total of 9720 controls. Odds ratios (ORs), and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs), were estimated by unconditional logistic regression models, including terms for socio-demographic factors, tobacco smoking, and alcohol intake. Results: Compared to the lowest tertile of processed meat consumption, the ORs for subjects in the highest one were 1.18 (95% CI 0.98–1.43) for oral cavity and pharyngeal, 1.51 (95% CI 1.18–1.91) for esophageal, 1.19 (95% CI 0.96–1.47) for laryngeal, 0.98 (95% CI 0.81–1.18) for stomach, 0.85 (95% CI 0.51–1.40) for biliary tract, 1.20 (95% CI 0.94–1.54) for liver, and 1.46 (95% CI 1.15–1.85) for pancreatic cancers. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that high processed meat consumption increases esophageal and pancreatic cancers risk.

Elaborating on the concepts of (multi)fractal and nonlinear analyses, the present contribution defines and studies formally novel non Gaussian multiscale representations. Methods: A methodological framework for non Gaussian multiscale representations constructed on wavelet p-leaders is developed, relying a priori neither on exact scale-free dynamics nor on predefined forms of departure from Gaussianity. Its versatility in quantifying the strength and nature of departure from Gaussian is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The ability of the representations to discriminate between healthy subjects and congestive heart failure (CHF) patients, and between survivors and nonsurvivor CHF patients, is assessed on a large cohort of 198 subjects. Results: The analysis leads to conclude that i) scale-free and multifractal dynamics are observed, both for healthy subjects and CHF patients, for time scales shorter than 170 s; ii) a circadian evolution of multifractal and non Gaussian properties of HRV is evidenced for healthy subjects, but not for CHF patients; iii) non Gaussian multiscale indices possess high discriminative abilities between survivor and nonsurvivor CHF patients, at specific time scales (? 20 s and ? 85 s). Conclusions: The non Gaussian multiscale representations provide evidence for the existence of short-term cascade-type multifractal mechanisms underlying HRV for both healthy and CHF subjects. A circadian evolution of this mechanism is only evidenced for the healthy group, suggesting an alteration of the sympathetic-parasympathetic balance for CHF patients. Significance: Results obtained for a large cohort of subjects suggest that the novel non Gaussian indices might robustly quantify crucial information for clinical risk stratification in CHF patients. ? 1964-2012 IEEE.",congestive heart failure; heart rate variability; Multiscale; non Gaussian; wavelet leaders,"Cardiology; Dynamics; Formal concept analysis; Fractals; Gaussian distribution; Gaussian noise (electronic); Wavelet analysis; Congestive heart failures; Heart rate variability; Multi-scale; Non-Gaussian; Wavelet leader; Heart; adult; aged; Article; case control study; circadian rhythm; cohort analysis; conceptual framework; congestive heart failure; controlled study; discrete wavelet transform; dynamics; female; fractal analysis; heart rate variability; hemodynamic parameters; human; Kaplan Meier method; major clinical study; male; non Gaussian multiscale; normal distribution; risk factor; statistical analysis; survivor; sympathetic tone; ambulatory electrocardiography; heart failure; heart rate; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; very elderly; wavelet analysis; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Female; Heart Failure; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Wavelet Analysis; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85045300404

Regional hyperthermia was used, with the expectation that it will enhance the anti-tumor effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This study aimed to assess the efficacy of neoadjuvant concomitant radiotherapy, hyperthermia, and chemotherapy (RHC) for salvage of recurrent or residual malignant STS. Methods: We identified 64 patients with recurrent or residual STS treated between 1994 and 2013. After excluding those with low-grade malignancy, with recurrent bone tumor in the soft tissues, with truncal STS, and who declined to participate, 23 patients (7 with recurrence and 16 with residual tumor) underwent RHC. The histologic diagnoses were undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (n = 11), synovial sarcoma (n = 3), leiomyosarcoma and myxoid liposarcoma (n = 2 each), and other histologic types. As primary outcomes, the 5-year overall survival (OS), distant metastasis-free survival (D-MFS), and local control (LC) rates were evaluated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Results: The median follow-up period was 112.3 months. The 5-year OS, D-MFS, and LC were 86.4%, 77.4%, and 86.7%, respectively. In the univariate analysis, tumor depth was considered as a negative prognostic factor for OS and D-MFS, and a positive margin was also a negative prognostic factor for OS, D-MFS LC with retained on Cox proportional hazards model in OS, and D-MFS. Conclusion: RHC is an effective option for salvage treatment of recurrent and residual STS. ? 2018, ? 2018 The Author(s).

We introduced new ECG indices for estimating non-REM sleep period and the frequency of sleep disordered breathing in addition to the conventional risk markers of heart rate variability (HRV).

However, the injuries were limited to the parietal peritoneum and did not show any fibrous encapsulation of the visceral peritoneum, which differs from human encapsular peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). We investigated peritoneal injury in a rat model of Zy-induced peritonitis pretreated with methylglyoxal (MGO) instead of scraping (Zy/MGO peritonitis) to clarify the role of C in the process of fibrous encapsulation of the visceral peritoneum. Therapeutic effects of an anti-C5a complementary peptide, AcPepA, on peritonitis were also studied. In Zy/MGO peritonitis, peritoneal thickness, fibrin exudation, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and deposition of C3b and C5b-9 with loss of membrane C regulators were increased along the peritoneum until day 5. Onday 14, fibrous encapsulation of the visceral peritoneum was observed, resembling human EPS. Peritoneal injuries and fibrous changes were significantly improved with AcPepA treatment, even when AcPepA was administered following injection of Zy in Zy/MGO peritonitis. The data show that C5a might play a role in the development of encapsulation-like changes in the visceral peritoneum in Zy/MGO peritonitis.

While various proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are upregulated in eyes with DR, their distinct contributions to disease progression remain elusive. Here, we evaluated roles of stromal cell-derived factor-1α (SDF-1α) and its receptor CXCR4 in the BRB breakdown initiated by pericyte deficiency. After inhibition of pericyte recruitment to developing retinal vessels in neonatal mice, endothelial cells (ECs) upregulated the expression of SDF-1α. Administration of CXCR4 antagonists, or EC-specific disruption of the CXCR4 gene, similarly restored the BRB integrity, even in the absence of pericyte coverage. Furthermore, CXCR4 inhibition significantly decreased both the expression levels of proinflammatory genes (P < 0.05) and the infiltration of macrophages (P < 0.05) into pericyte-deficient retinas. Taken together, EC-derived SDF-1α induced by pericyte deficiency exacerbated inflammation through CXCR4 in an autocrine or paracrine manner and thereby induced macrophage infiltration and BRB breakdown.

Recent HBV genetic research has revealed novel genetic rearrangements termed complex structural variations (SVs), which are composed of combinations of SVs such as insertions, deletions, and duplications. An extensive search was made for complex SVs of HBV and their characteristics were analyzed. Results: Fifty-five HBV strains with complex SVs were identified by analyzing genetic sequences of HBV with bioinformatical tools. Along with 15 HBV strains with complex SVs in a previous report, a total of 70 HBV strains harboring complex SVs were analyzed. Complex SVs in the HBV genome were located frequently between nt 1500 and 2000. Insertions were observed in 65/70 (92.9%) of HBV strains with complex SVs. As insertional motif sequences, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding site, a sequence complementary to part of box α in enhancer II, and insertions of unknown origins were observed. The complex SVs were classified into six groups, and combination of insertion and deletion was observed more frequently than other patterns. Conclusion: Through an extensive search of HBV sequences, new strains with complex SVs were identified in this study. Characteristics of HBV with complex SVs were clarified by the analysis of 70 HBV strains harboring complex SVs.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate outcomes and complications of simultaneous laparoscopic cystectomy and unilateral or bilateral nephroureterectomy with umbilical RPS. Methods: We performed a preliminary case series of 4 patients with synchronous upper urinary tract (UUT) tumor and invasive bladder cancer who underwent simultaneous laparoscopic cystectomy and unilateral or bilateral nephroureterectomy with umbilical RPS between 2014 and 2017 at our hospital. Demographic data, pathologic features, the surgical technique, and outcomes were retrospectively analyzed. Result: All 4 patients were men whose median age was 79 years (range 65-85 years) and median body mass index was 24.2 kg/m2 (range 21.5-27.3 kg/m2). The laparoscopic approach was technically successful in all 4 patients without the need for open conversion. The median total operative time was 434 minutes (range 372-481 minutes). The median estimated blood loss was 773 ml (range 153-923 ml), median interval to resuming oral intake was 2 days (range 1-7 days), and median hospital stay was 16 days (range 13-20 days).

Methods: The questionnaire, based on physicians, contains 9 questions focused on UC management and cancer surveillance. In addition, the questionnaire based on neoplastic cases, which contains 17 questions, was collected and analyzed. Results: With regard to the diagnosis of UC-associated cancer, most respondents started surveillance colonoscopy within 10 years from onset, favored targeted biopsies, and thought advanced imaging was useful. As for morphology, the frequency of elevated lesion and type 4 lesions was most common in early and advanced cancer, respectively.

The PHHs from the Japanese donor increased more than 100-fold in the mouse liver, and human hepatocytes purified from the chimeric mouse liver (hcPHs) were successfully transplanted into second-passaged mice. These PHHs and hcPHs can produce human albumin and preserve many liver-specific enzyme genes, which are important for liver function. Interestingly, hepatitis B virus can be infected with these chimeric mice; hepatitis B viral DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen levels were detectable.

Materials and Methods: We evaluated the impact of the mGPS and HS-mGPS on the overall survival (OS) in 129 patients with HNC treated at Aichi Cancer Center Central Hospital from 2012-2013. The mGPS was calculated as follows: mGPS of 0, C-reactive protein (CRP) ?1.0 mg/dl; 1, CRP &gt;1.0 mg/dl; 2, CRP&gt;1.0 mg/dl and albumin &lt;3.5 mg/dl. Regarding the HS-mGPS, the CRP threshold level was set as 0.3 mg/dl. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were estimated by Cox proportional hazard models after adjusting for potential confounders. Results: The prognosis of HNC worsened significantly as both the mGPS and HS-mGPS increased in a univariate analysis. After adjusting for covariates, the HS-mGPS was significantly associated with the OS (adjusted HR for HS-mGPS of 2 compared to an HS-mGPS of 0 [HR score2-0 ] 3.14 [95% CI: 1.23-8.07], P trend &lt; 0.001), while the mGPS was suggested to be associated with the survival (HR score2-0 2.37 [95% CI:0.89-6.33], P trend = 0.145). Even after stratification by clinical covariates, these associations persisted. Conclusion: We conclude that the HS-mGPS is useful as an independent prognostic factor in HNC. ? 2018 Hanai et al.",C-reactive protein; Head and neck cancer; High-sensitivity modified Glasgow prognostic score; Modified Glasgow prognostic score; Survival,albumin; C reactive protein; adult; aged; albumin blood level; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; disease assessment; disease association; female; follow up; head and neck cancer; human; major clinical study; male; modified Glasgow prognostic score; overall survival; protein blood level; retrospective study; sensitivity analysis,2-s2.0-85058300855

CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusions have been associated with a favorable clinical outcome. Methods: Forty-seven T1/2N0M0 mucoepidermoid carcinoma cases positive for CRTC1/3-MAML2 fusions were completely resected and were not treated with PORT. Results: Pathologically, none of the cases showed tumor spillage or perineural invasion. Cases with intermediate/high-grade histology numbered 9 (19%) to 26 (55%) with the currently used 3 different grading systems. During the follow-up (median 60 months), locoregional tumor recurrence occurred in 4 cases, which were treated with surgery alone. At the last follow-up (median 60 months; 7-160), all patients were alive with no evidence of disease.

The purpose of this paper is to report the survival and the late toxicities of JCOG0702. Materials and methods The continual reassessment method was used to determine the dose level that patients should be assigned to and to estimate the maximum tolerated dose. The starting dose was 40 Gy in four fractions at D 95 of PTV. Results Twenty-eight patients were enrolled. Ten patients were treated with 40 Gy at D 95 of PTV, four patients with 45 Gy, eight patients with 50 Gy, one patient with 55 Gy and five patients with 60 Gy. Ten patients were alive at the last follow-up. Overall survival (OS) for all patients was 67.9% (95% CI 47.3-81.8%) at 3 years and 40.8% (95% CI 22.4-58.5%) at 5 years. No Grade 3 or higher toxicity was observed after 181 days from the beginning of the SBRT. Compared to the toxicities up to 180 days, chest wall related toxicities were more frequent after 181 days. Conclusions The 5-year OS of 40.8% indicates the possibility that SBRT for peripheral T2N0M0 non-small cell lung cancer is superior to conventional radiotherapy. The effect of the SBRT dose escalation on OS is unclear and further studies are warranted. ? The Author(s) 2018.

Methods: A total of 973 clinical treatment plans were collected from 12 institutions. Commercial software employing the Clarkson algorithm was used for verification after a measurement validation study, and the doses from the treatment planning systems (TPSs) and verification programs were compared on the basis of the mean value ± two standard deviations. The impact of heterogeneous conditions was assessed in two types of sites: non-lung and lung. Results: The dose difference for all locations was 0.5 ± 7.2%. There was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.01) in dose difference between non-lung (?0.3 ± 4.4%) and lung sites (3.5 ± 6.7%). Inter-institutional comparisons showed that various systematic differences were associated with the proportion of different treatment sites and heterogeneity correction. Conclusions: This multi-institutional comparison should help to determine the departmental action levels for CyberKnife, Vero4DRT, and TomoTherapy, as patient populations and treatment sites may vary between the modalities. An action level of ±5% could be considered for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), non-IMRT, and volumetric modulated arc radiotherapy using these modalities in homogenous and heterogeneous conditions with a large treatment field applied to a large region of homogeneous media. There were larger systematic differences in heterogeneous conditions with a small treatment field because of differences in heterogeneity correction with the different dose calculation algorithms of the primary TPS and verification program. ? 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",Independent calculation verification; Institution-specific tolerance; Multi-institutional comparison; non-C-arm linear accelerator; Quality assurance,"algorithm; Article; comparative study; computer assisted radiography; controlled study; dosimetry; measurement; nonlinear system; retrospective study; software; validation study; Vero4DRT radiotherapy delivery system; clinical trial; devices; health care quality; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; lung; magnetic and electromagnetic equipment; multicenter study; procedures; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; Algorithms; Humans; Lung; Particle Accelerators; Quality Assurance, Health Care; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85056916203

Recent Findings: Using a wide variety of biophysical techniques, the structure and composition of endogenous discoidal HDL have now largely been solved. This has led to the development of new methods for the in vitro reconstitution of nanodisc HDL, which have proven to have a wide variety of biomedical applications. Nanodisc HDL has been used as a platform for mimicking the plasma membrane for the reconstitution and investigation of the structures of several plasma membrane proteins, such as cytochrome P450s and ABC transporters. Nanodisc HDL has also been designed as drug carriers to transport amphipathic, as well as hydrophobic small molecules, and has potential therapeutic applications for several diseases. Finally, nanodisc HDL itself like native discoidal HDL can mediate cholesterol efflux from cells and are currently being tested in late-stage clinical trials for cardiovascular disease. Summary: The discovery of the characterization of native discoidal HDL has inspired a new field of synthetic nanodisc HDL, which has offered a growing number of unanticipated biomedical applications. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Apolipoprotein A-I; CYP; Drug delivery; High-density lipoprotein (HDL); Mimetic peptides; Nanodiscs,"ABC transporter; apolipoprotein A1; cytochrome P450; discoidal high density lipoprotein; high density lipoprotein; nanodisc; unclassified drug; discoidal lipoproteins; drug vehicle; high density lipoprotein; lipoprotein; antiinflammatory activity; biophysics; cardiovascular disease; cell membrane; chemical composition; cholesterol transport; drug cytotoxicity; drug delivery system; drug mechanism; drug research; drug safety; drug structure; human; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; medical technology; membrane reconstitution; nonhuman; protein structure; Review; metabolism; transport at the cellular level; Biological Transport; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Lipoproteins; Lipoproteins, HDL; Pharmaceutical Vehicles",2-s2.0-85056107385

Here, we present a preliminary study on whether coffee and its major components, caffeine and chlorogenic acid, would affect the gut dysbiosis and the disrupted plasma SCFA profile of TSOD mice, which could lead to improvement in the liver pathology of these mice. Three mice per group were used. Daily intake of coffee or its components for 16 wk prevented liver lobular inflammation without improving obesity in TSOD mice. Coffee and its components did not repair the altered levels of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and an increased abundance of Firmicutes in TSOD mice but rather caused additional changes in bacteria in six genera. However, caffeine and chlorogenic acid partially improved the disrupted plasma SCFA profile in TSOD mice, although coffee had no effects. Whether these alterations in the gut microbiome and the plasma SCFA profile might affect the liver pathology of TSOD mice may deserve further investigation. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"caffeine; chlorogenic acid; volatile fatty acid; animal; chemistry; coffee; disease model; drug effect; dysbiosis; human; inflammation; intestine flora; liver; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; microbiology; mouse; mouse mutant; obesity; pathophysiology; Animals; Caffeine; Chlorogenic Acid; Coffee; Disease Models, Animal; Dysbiosis; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Inflammation; Liver; Metabolic Syndrome; Mice; Mice, Obese; Obesity",2-s2.0-85055906433

A previous study by our group has indicated that the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced migration of osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells is mediated by the phosphorylation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein (MAPK), p38 MAPK, stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK)/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Akt, and that resveratrol, a major polyphenol in grape skin, suppresses the EGF-induced migration by attenuating Akt and SAPK/JNK activation. In the present study, the effects of chlorogenic acid, a major phenolic acid in coffee, and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a major flavonoid in green tea, on the EGF-induced migration of MC3T3-E1 cells were investigated. EGCG significantly reduced the EGF-induced migration as evaluated by a Transwell migration assay and by a wound healing assay. However, chlorogenic acid failed to affect the EGF-induced migration. The phosphorylation of p38 MAPK induced by EGF was significantly suppressed by EGCG; however, the EGF-induced phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase, SAPK/JNK or Akt was not affected by EGCG. These results suggest that EGCG, but not chlorogenic acid, suppresses EGF-induced osteoblast migration through inhibiting p38 MAPK activation. ? 2018 Spandidos Publications.

EHS is associated with human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQB1*06:02, similar to narcolepsy with cataplexy (narcolepsy). Previous studies suggest that DQB1*06:02-positive and -negative EHS are different in terms of their clinical features and follow different pathological pathways. DQB1*06:02-positive EHS and narcolepsy share the same susceptibility genes. In the present study, we report a genome-wide association study with replication for DQB1*06:02-negative EHS (408 patients and 2247 healthy controls, all Japanese). One single-nucleotide polymorphism, rs10988217, which is located 15-kb upstream of carnitine O-acetyltransferase (CRAT), was significantly associated with DQB1*06:02-negative EHS (P = 7.5 × 10?9, odds ratio = 2.63). The risk allele of the disease-associated SNP was correlated with higher expression levels of CRAT in various tissues and cell types, including brain tissue. In addition, the risk allele was associated with levels of succinylcarnitine (P = 1.4 × 10?18) in human blood. The leading SNP in this region was the same in associations with both DQB1*06:02-negative EHS and succinylcarnitine levels. The results suggest that DQB1*06:02-negative EHS may be associated with an underlying dysfunction in energy metabolic pathways. ? 2018, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Japan Society of Human Genetics.",,"acylcarnitine; carnitine acetyltransferase; HLA DQB1 antigen; phosphoprotein phosphatase 2A; succinylcarnitine; unclassified drug; carnitine acetyltransferase; HLA DQ antigen; HLA-DQB1 antigen; allele; Article; brain tissue; clinical feature; controlled study; expression quantitative trait locus; genetic association; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; human; hypersomnia; major clinical study; metabolism; narcolepsy; pathogenesis; single nucleotide polymorphism; chromosome 9; clinical trial; enzymology; female; genetics; male; multicenter study; single nucleotide polymorphism; somnolence; Carnitine O-Acetyltransferase; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 9; Disorders of Excessive Somnolence; Female; Genome-Wide Association Study; HLA-DQ beta-Chains; Humans; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-85054413006

The androgen signalling pathway, a potential therapeutic target, can be regulated by FOXA1. This study aimed to evaluate the clinicopathological implications of FOXA1 in SDC. Methods and results: We examined the relationship between the immunoexpression of FOXA1 and FOXA1 mutations and clinicopathological factors, including the biomarker status and clinical outcome, in 142 SDCs. FOXA1 was expressed in 128 SDCs (90.1%); the immunoexpression was heterogeneous. SDCs with a higher FOXA1 labelling index (LI) (?20%) more frequently showed less advanced tumors on T classification (P?=?0.002). FOXA1 LI was correlated positively with the AR expression value (r?=?0.430, P?<?0.001). PI3K and p-mTOR positivity, and intact-PTEN, were associated with a higher FOXA1 LI. Twenty-two of 121 SDCs (18.2%) harboured FOXA1 gene mutations at the flanking regions in and around the forkhead DNA binding domain; however, the given gene mutation and the expression of FOXA1 were not significantly correlated. A multivariate analysis revealed that SDCs with a higher FOXA1 LI were associated with longer overall survival and progression-free survival (P?=?0.029 and 0.016, respectively). Conclusions: In SDC, FOXA1, which may biologically interact with the AR and PI3K signalling pathways, is a putative biomarker that may be associated with a favourable prognosis. Further studies are needed to apply the findings to the development of targeted personalised therapy for patients with SDC. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",androgen receptor; FOXA1; PI3K signalling pathway; salivary duct carcinoma,"androgen; androgen receptor; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3alpha; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; tumor marker; androgen receptor; AR protein, human; FOXA1 protein, human; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3alpha; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; tumor marker; adult; advanced cancer; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; clinical feature; clinical outcome; DNA flanking region; female; foxa1 gene; gene mutation; histopathology; human; human tissue; major clinical study; male; middle aged; oncogene; overall survival; personalized medicine; priority journal; progression free survival; protein DNA binding; protein expression; protein protein interaction; salivary duct carcinoma; signal transduction; survival rate; aged; carcinoma; genetics; immunohistochemistry; metabolism; mortality; mutation; pathology; phosphorylation; physiology; prognosis; salivary gland duct; salivary gland tumor; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma; Female; Hepatocyte Nuclear Factor 3-alpha; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; Phosphorylation; Prognosis; Receptors, Androgen; Salivary Ducts; Salivary Gland Neoplasms; Signal Transduction; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85053751440

This study evaluated 5-year results of radiotherapy in such patients in comparison with those for postoperative LN metastases. Materials and methods: Between 2004 and 2013, 27 patients with hilar and/or mediastinal LN metastases without local recurrence and distant metastasis after SBRT (n = 14) or surgery (n = 13) were treated with definitive conventional radiotherapy. The median total dose for treating metastatic LN was 60?Gy for the post-SBRT group and 66?Gy for the post-surgery group. Results: The median follow-up for the 5 surviving patients was 62?months. The overall survival, cause-specific survival, progression-free survival, and local control rates at 5?years after mediastinal irradiation were 14%, 45%, 21%, and 58%, respectively, for the 14 patients in the post-SBRT group.

Aims: We aimed to clarify the association between the results of UroVysion FISH assays and the prognosis of CCA. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 49 specimens obtained by transpapillary forceps biopsy from consecutive patients with CCA. The copy numbers of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17 were evaluated by FISH assay using UroVysion. We compared the overall survival (OS) of CCA patients with and without increased copy numbers of chromosomes 3, 7, and 17. Furthermore, we evaluated the association between OS and the clinicopathological parameters of CCA patients. Results: The OS was significantly shorter in patients with than without an increased chromosome 7 copy number (log-rank p = 0.015; median OS 11.9 vs. 20.7?months). In the univariate analyses, age (p = 0.012), ECOG performance status (p = 0.046), tumor stage (p = 0.046), surgery (p = 0.006), and an increased chromosome 7 copy number (p = 0.017) were significantly associated with OS.

The etiology is considered to be geniculate ganglionitis due to reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV). Encephalitis is a rare but serious complication of VZV reactivation. Clarifying the regional and temporal evolution of the lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would help with understanding the pathology of the lesion, but this information is lacking in encephalitis with RHS. Therefore, here, we reviewed sequential MR images in three RHS cases complicated by brainstem lesions. All the regions of the lesions represent specific neuronal structures—the ipsilateral solitary nucleus (SN) and spinal trigeminal nucleus and tract (STNT) in case 1; bilateral SN, ipsilateral STNT, and vestibular nucleus in case 2; ipsilateral SN and vestibular nucleus in case 3—and this seems to account for the persistent robust symptoms. Case 1 initially showed no abnormalities on MRI and cases 2 and 3 showed weak signals on the first MRI which subsequently plateaued. These observations suggest the timeframe within which it becomes possible to detect regional and temporal evolution, namely, that the distribution of the affected regions expands between weeks 2 and 5 after onset of facial paralysis. These observations and the findings of a literature review indicate that the SN, STNT, and vestibular nucleus are relatively prone to developing encephalitis after RHS. ? 2018, Journal of NeuroVirology, Inc.",Brainstem encephalitis; Magnetic resonance imaging; Ramsay Hunt syndrome; Varicella-zoster virus,"adult; Article; auricle; case report; clinical article; disease severity; dizziness; dysphagia; facial nerve paralysis; female; fluid attenuated inversion recovery; hearing impairment; herpes zoster oticus; hiccup; human; male; middle aged; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nystagmus; pontine tegmentum; priority journal; soft palate; solitary tract nucleus; spinal trigeminal nucleus; vertigo; vestibular nucleus; vocal cord; diagnostic imaging; herpes zoster oticus; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; solitary tract nucleus; spinal trigeminal nucleus; vestibular nucleus; Female; Herpes Zoster Oticus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Solitary Nucleus; Trigeminal Nucleus, Spinal; Vestibular Nuclei",2-s2.0-85052839756

However, there have been limited attempts to examine either the impact of relative poverty on child development or the relationships between specific SES indicators and mental health domains. This study elucidates these relationships in Japanese preschool children who experience high levels of relative poverty. Participants were 3218 Japanese children aged 5–6 years. Their mothers completed self-report questionnaires on SES indicators and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire to measure emotional/behavioral problems. Children’s teachers evaluated children’s social competence using the Social Skills Questionnaire for Preschoolers. Each SES indicator had an inverse relationship with all emotional/behavioral problem domains in the univariate analysis. In the multivariate analysis, lower family income consistently predicted higher scores on all emotional/behavioral problem domains, whereas lower maternal and paternal education levels independently predicted higher scores in specific domains. Each SES indicator had positive relationships with all social competence dimensions in the univariate analysis. Higher family income consistently predicted higher social competence in the multivariate analysis. However, paternal education level only predicted self-control, and maternal education did not predict social competence. Family income and parental education levels were significant independent predictors of emotional/behavioral problems and social competence. Thus, this study suggests that SES does affect child outcomes in a country where there is a high level of relative poverty and underscores the importance of assessing income and education status separately in order to identify their potentially unique associations with development among preschool children. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Emotional/behavioral problems; Preschool children; Social competence; Socioeconomic status,,2-s2.0-85052614648

Among children with hepatitis B envelope antigen-positive genotype C chronic HBV infection, we compared the efficacy of combination therapy with nucleotide analogues and IFN-α in 11 children with 12 historical cases treated with IFN monotherapy. Methods: The combination of lamivudine and conventional IFN-α was introduced for the first three patients; the other eight patients were treated with entecavir and pegylated IFN. Results: Demographic factors as well as baseline HBsAg titers and HBV-DNA levels were similar between the two groups. In the combination therapy group, viral loads were suppressed in 9/11 to below 4.0?log?copies/mL both at the end of the therapy (EOT) and at 6?months after EOT. In contrast, in the IFN monotherapy group, suppression of viral loads was observed in 2/12 and 3/12 at EOT and at 6?months after EOT, respectively. In the combination therapy group, HBsAg titers dropped from 4.03 at pretreatment to 2.91?log?IU/mL at 6?months after EOT with 4/11 showing a drop to below 1000?IU/mL (one patient achieved HBsAg clearance). In contrast, the amount of HBsAg did not change during the corresponding periods in the IFN monotherapy group. Conclusions: Our preliminary results suggest that combination therapy might be effective in the suppression of HBsAg production as well as HBV-DNA production for children with genotype C chronic HBV infection. ? 2018 The Japan Society of Hepatology",genotype C; HBeAg seroconversion; HBsAg seroconversion; interferon; nucleotide analogue,alpha interferon; entecavir; hepatitis B surface antigen; lamivudine; peginterferon; virus DNA; Article; child; child health; clinical article; controlled study; demography; DNA determination; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; human; lethargy; leukopenia; male; monotherapy; nonhuman; outcome assessment; priority journal; thrombocytopenia; treatment duration; treatment planning; virus load,2-s2.0-85052433828

However, a recent study reported that HBV reactivation occurred in HBcAb-negative patients, indicating that it is challenging to identify patients with a history of HBV infection using conventional HBcAb reagent. We developed a highly sensitive HBcAb (HBcAb-HS) assay for reducing the risk of HBV reactivation. Methods: The HBcAb-HS assay is an automated chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay system, which is suitable for clinical use. The cut-off was set at 0.020?IU/mL from the distribution patterns of HBcAb-negative specimens, and we evaluated the performance of this assay compared with conventional reagents. Results: This new assay showed a 27–81-fold greater sensitivity than conventional HBcAb reagents; the quantified measurement range was from 0.005?IU/mL to 1.500?IU/mL, and it showed excellent quantitative performance and correlated well with two conventional assays, using the HBcAb-positive specimens. Moreover, it showed 100% specificity for the 469 purchased HBcAb-negative specimens. Notably, this newly developed HBcAb-HS assay showed positivity in the preserved specimens before HBV reactivation, for which conventional HBcAb reagents gave negative results, and the HBcAb-HS assay could detect the lower HBcAb levels even after intensive immunosuppressive therapies, including autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. Conclusions: The clinical efficacy of the newly developed, highly sensitive HBcAb assay would enable the identification of patients at risk of HBV reactivation more accurately. ? 2018 The Authors.

A prospective multi-institutional cohort study was designed to elucidate the safety of early chest tube removal after thoracoscopic lobectomy. Methods: Between April 2009 and November 2011, 310 patients with suspected or histologically documented lung cancer were screened. Patients without air leakage or bloody, chylous, or purulent pleural effusion underwent chest tube removal on the day after thoracoscopic lobectomy, independent of the drainage volume. The subjects were classified into three groups as tertiles according to the drainage volume that was observed for approximately 24?h after surgery. The associations between the drainage volume and the development of complications were investigated, with several clinical factors taken into account. Results: The 162 patients who were enrolled underwent early chest tube removal via this protocol and were classified into three groups according to their drainage volume (0–219?mL, n = 52; 220–349?mL, n = 56; and ? 350?mL, n = 54). A 7F backup tube placed within the dead space to prevent troubles was removed by postoperative day 4 in all patients because nothing happened. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the drainage volume was not associated with the risk of complications. Conclusions: Early removal of the chest tube on the day after thoracoscopic lobectomy appears to be a safe treatment protocol in patients without air leakage or bloody, chylous, or purulent pleural effusion; however, careful surveillance is needed for patients who have a drainage volume of ? 350?mL/day.

Despite its severity, there are no effective treatments because of the complexity of its pathogenesis. As one of the underlying mechanisms of Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene mutation-induced ALS, SOD1 mutants (SOD1mut) commonly interact with an endoplasmic reticulum-resident membrane protein Derlin-1, triggering motoneuron death. However, the importance of SOD1-Derlin-1 interaction in in vitro human model and in vivo mouse model remains to be elucidated. Here, we identify small-molecular-weight compounds that inhibit the SOD1-Derlin-1 interaction by screening approximately 160,000 compounds. The inhibitor prevents 122 types of SOD1mut from interacting with Derlin-1, and significantly ameliorates the ALS pathology both in motoneurons derived from patient induced pluripotent stem cells and in model mice. Our data suggest that the SOD1-Derlin-1 interaction contributes to the pathogenesis of ALS and is a promising drug target for ALS treatment. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"central nervous system agents; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; derlin 1; membrane protein; oxidoreductase inhibitor; protein inhibitor; superoxide dismutase 1 derlin 1 inhibitor; unclassified drug; copper zinc superoxide dismutase; DERL1 protein, human; membrane protein; protein binding; complexity; genetic analysis; inhibition; inhibitor; membrane; molecular analysis; mutation; nervous system disorder; pathology; protein; rodent; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; drug screening; human; human cell; in vivo study; induced pluripotent stem cell; male; motoneuron; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; protein protein interaction; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; animal; brain; C57BL mouse; disease model; drug effect; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; molecular library; pharmacology; spinal cord; transgenic mouse; Mus; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Animals; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Transgenic; Protein Binding; Small Molecule Libraries; Spinal Cord; Superoxide Dismutase-1",2-s2.0-85049835014

Purpose: Osteoporosis and associated fractures are major concerns for patients with systemic rheumatic diseases on long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Bisphosphonates increase bone mineral density (BMD) and reduce the frequency of vertebral fractures, but they are associated with poor adherence. The effects of monthly oral minodronate on patients’ satisfaction, BMD, and bone turnover markers were investigated in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases on glucocorticoids and weekly oral alendronate or risedronate. Methods: Study patients with systemic rheumatic diseases on oral glucocorticoids and weekly alendronate 35?mg or risedronate 17.5?mg were randomly assigned either to switch to minodronate 50?mg every 4?weeks or to continue the currently taking weekly bisphosphonate for 52?weeks after a 24-week run-in period.Patients were stratified by hospital site, sex, and menopausal status in women at enrollment. The primary endpoint was the difference between the proportions of patients who responded very satisfactory or satisfactory for the current bisphosphonate therapy at weeks 48 and 76 between the two groups. Secondary endpoints included percentage changes in lumbar spine BMD and bone turnover markers from the time of starting allocated treatment. Results: Monthly minodronate was superior to weekly alendronate or risedronate for patients’ satisfaction, the increase of lumbar spine BMD, and suppression of serum tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b at week 76. Conclusions: Monthly minodronate is more acceptable and may be more effective than weekly alendronate or risedronate for prevention and treatment of bone loss in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases on glucocorticoid therapy. ? 2018, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Alendronate; Bisphosphonate; Glucocorticoid; Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis; Minodronate; Risedronate,"acid phosphatase tartrate resistant isoenzyme; alendronic acid; alkaline phosphatase; glucocorticoid; minodronic acid; risedronic acid; alendronic acid; bisphosphonic acid derivative; bone density conservation agent; glucocorticoid; adult; aged; ANCA associated vasculitis; Article; bone density; bone turnover; controlled study; dermatomyositis; disease duration; drug efficacy; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; female; gastrointestinal symptom; human; jaw osteonecrosis; lumbar spine; lumbar vertebra; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; multicenter study; open study; osteoclast activity; osteolysis; osteoporosis; patient compliance; patient satisfaction; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; rheumatic disease; spine fracture; systemic disease; systemic lupus erythematosus; treatment duration; chemically induced; clinical trial; complication; drug administration; drug effect; follow up; fracture; incidence; Japan; middle aged; oral drug administration; osteoporosis; rheumatic disease; Administration, Oral; Adult; Aged; Alendronate; Bone Density; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Diphosphonates; Drug Administration Schedule; Drug Substitution; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Fractures, Bone; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Patient Satisfaction; Prospective Studies; Rheumatic Diseases",2-s2.0-85048606302

The aim of this study was to evaluate prognostic factors, including colorectal obstruction. Methods: Data were retrospectively reviewed from consecutive patients with stage II/III CRC who underwent curative surgery between January 2007 and December 2011?at two Japanese institutions. We analyzed overall survival (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS), according to various prognostic factors including colorectal obstruction. Results: In total, 979 patients with stage II/III CRC were identified for this study. Among these 979 patients, 94 patients showed colorectal obstruction (9.6%). In both stage II and stage III CRCs, colorectal obstruction showed significantly poorer OS and RFS compared to non-obstruction (5-year OS, obstruction vs. non-obstruction, stage II: 65.9 vs. 86.5%, P = 0.002; stage III: 55.9 vs. 73.6%, P = 0.007) (5-year RFS, obstruction vs. non-obstruction, stage II: 59.2 vs. 77.8%, P = 0.008; stage III 31.3 vs. 56.3%, P = 0.001). Multivariate analysis demonstrated colorectal obstruction as a significant independent and poor prognostic factor in terms of both OS (hazard ratio (HR) 2.469; 95% CI 1.339–4.545; P = 0.004) and RFS (HR 1.992; 95% CI 1.160–3.425; P = 0.012) for stage II CRC, as well as pT4 stage. On multivariate analysis for stage III CRC, colorectal obstruction was a significant predictor of poor RFS (HR 1.626; 95% CI 1.070–2.469; P = 0.023), but not poor OS. Conclusions: Colorectal obstruction is an independent poor prognostic factor for stage II CRC.

No laboratory findings or drugs explaining her agitation were identified. Although the patient did not develop delirium, ophthalmoplegia, or ataxia, WE was suspected because she experienced a loss of appetite loss lasting 5 weeks. This diagnosis was supported by abnormal serum thiamine and disappearance of agitation one hour after intravenous thiamine administration.Significance of results This report emphasizes the clinical diversity of WE and indicates the limits of the ability to diagnose WE from typical clinical symptoms.

However, the accurate detection of these indels from next-generation sequencing data is still challenging. This is particularly true for intermediate-size indels (?50 bp), due to the short DNA sequencing reads. Here, we developed a new method that predicts intermediate-size indels using BWA soft-clipped fragments (unmatched fragments in partially mapped reads) and unmapped reads. We report the performance comparison of our method, GATK, PINDEL and ScanIndel, using whole exome sequencing data from the same samples. False positive and false negative counts were determined through Sanger sequencing of all predicted indels across these four methods. The harmonic mean of the recall and precision, F-measure, was used to measure the performance of each method. Our method achieved the highest F-measure of 0.84 in one sample, compared to 0.56 for GATK, 0.52 for PINDEL and 0.46 for ScanIndel. Similar results were obtained in additional samples, demonstrating that our method was superior to the other methods for detecting intermediate-size indels. We believe that this methodology will contribute to the discovery of intermediate-size indels associated with human disease. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"DNA; biology; chemistry; human; human genome; indel mutation; isolation and purification; metabolism; procedures; software; tumor cell line; whole exome sequencing; Cell Line, Tumor; Computational Biology; DNA; Genome, Human; Humans; INDEL Mutation; Software; Whole Exome Sequencing",2-s2.0-85044986698

In the present study, we examined the hypothesis whether NYT improves the functional loss of skeletal muscle cancer cachexia. Male C57/BL 6J mice with B16BF6 melanoma tumor showed decreased expression of myosin heavy chain (MHC) in the gastrocnemius muscle. Moreover, the expression of SOCS3 and phosphorylated STAT3 and AMPK was increased, and the expression of phosphorylated 4E-BP1 was decreased in the gastrocnemius muscle of tumor-bearing mice. These data suggested that amino acid metabolism was altered in tumor-bearing mice, which were normalized by the NYT intervention.

However, published data on this association are somewhat inconclusive. Methods: Articles investigating the association between three KLK3 (rs1058205, rs2735839, and rs266882) variants and PCa susceptibility were searched from online databases, which included 35,838 patients and 36,369 control participants. Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to demonstrate the strength of the association. We also utilized ELISA to detect serum expression of KLK3. In addition, in silico tools were adopted to evaluate the relationship of KLK3 expression and PCa survival time. Results: The overall results indicated that polymorphism T&gt;C of rs1058205 was associated with decreased risk of PCa (allele contrast: OR = 0.75, 95% CI = 0.64–0.88, Pheterogeneity &lt; 0.001; homozygote comparison: OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.42–0.81, Pheterogeneity &lt; 0.001), particularly in Caucasian population (allele contrast: OR = 0.77, 95% CI = 0.65–0.91, Pheterogeneity &lt; 0.001; homozygote comparison: OR = 0.58, 95% CI = 0.41–0.82, Pheterogeneity &lt; 0.001). No association was observed between the polymorphism A&gt;G of rs2735839 and risk of PCa. In addition, no association was observed between polymorphism A&gt;G of rs266882 and risk of PCa. Serum KLK3 levels in PCa patients carrying CC/CT genotypes were statistically lower than those carrying TT genotypes.

Recent studies demonstrated that ‘protein misfolding and aggregation’ (i.e. amyloidogenesis) is a common principle underlying the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including prion, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Perkinson’s (PD), Alzheimer’s (AD) diseases and polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases such as spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) and Hantington’s disease (HD). By these findings, the yeast has again been drawing increased attention as a useful system for studying neurodegenerative proteinopathies. So far, it has been reported that proteolytic cleavage of causative amyloidogenic proteins might affect the pathogenesis of the respective neurodegenerative diseases. Although those reports provide a clear phenomenological description, in the majority of cases, it has remained elusive if proteolysis is directly involved in the pathogenesis of the diseases. Recently, we have demonstrated in yeast that proteolysis suppresses prion generation. The yeast-based strategy might make a breakthrough to the unsolved issues. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Amyloid; APP; HTT; neurodegenerative disease; PrA-PrB; prion; proteolysis; Sup35; TDP-43,ADAM protein; ADAM10 endopeptidase; alpha secretase; amyloid protein; anterior pharynx defective 1 protein; beta secretase; beta secretase 1; beta secretase 2; calpain; caspase; cathepsin; gamma secretase; glycosylphosphatidylinositol; heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein; huntingtin; metalloproteinase; nicastrin; octamer transcription factor; polyglutamine; presenilin 1; presenilin 2; prion protein; protein kinase C; proteinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; TAR DNA binding protein; tumor necrosis factor alpha converting enzyme; Alzheimer disease; amyloidosis; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; degenerative disease; disease course; enzyme activity; gene overexpression; genetic code; human; Huntington chorea; nonhuman; nuclear export signal; Parkinson disease; pathogenesis; phenomenology; protein aggregation; protein cleavage; protein degradation; protein misfolding; protein motif; protein polymerization; proteinosis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; signal transduction; spinocerebellar degeneration; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85054397348

However, little is known about the association between exposure to passive smoking and chronic hypertension. We aimed to examine this association in a cross-sectional study, after controlling multiple potential confounders. Participants included 32,098 lifetime nonsmokers (7,216 men and 24,882 women) enrolled in the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. Passive smoking was assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The single question about exposure to passive smoking had five response options: ?gsometimes or almost never,?h ?galmost every day, 2 hours/day or less,?h ?galmost every day, 2 to 4 hours/day,?h ?galmost every day, 4 to 6 hours/day,?h and ?galmost every day, 6 hours/day or longer.?h Hypertension was defined as any of the following: systolic blood pressure ?140mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ?90mmHg, or use of antihypertensive medication. Multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for hypertension were estimated by exposure level to passive smoking using unconditional logistic regression models. The multivariate-adjusted OR for hypertension in those exposed almost every day was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.03.1.20) compared with those exposed sometimes or almost never. The OR for a 1-hour per day increase in exposure was 1.03 (95% CI: 1.01.1.06, Pfor trend=.006). This association was stronger in men than in women; the ORs were 1.08 (95% CI: 1.01.1.15, Pfor trend=.036) and 1.03 (95% CI: 1.00.1.05, Pfor trend=.055), respectively.

Population pharmacokinetic analyses were conducted to determine the pharmacokinetics of intravenous daratumumab in combination therapy versus monotherapy, evaluate the effect of patient- and disease-related covariates on drug disposition, and examine the relationships between daratumumab exposure and efficacy/safety outcomes. Methods: Four clinical studies of daratumumab in combination with lenalidomide/dexamethasone (POLLUX and GEN503); bortezomib/dexamethasone (CASTOR); pomalidomide/dexamethasone, bortezomib/thalidomide/dexamethasone, and bortezomib/melphalan/prednisone (EQUULEUS) were included in the analysis. Using various dosing schedules, the majority of patients (684/694) received daratumumab at a dose of 16?mg/kg. In GEN503, daratumumab was administered at a dose of 2?mg/kg (n = 3), 4?mg/kg (n = 3), 8?mg/kg (n = 4), and 16?mg/kg (n = 34). A total of 650 patients in EQUULEUS (n = 128), POLLUX (n = 282), and CASTOR (n = 240) received daratumumab 16?mg/kg. The exposure–efficacy and exposure–safety relationships examined progression-free survival (PFS) and selected adverse events (infusion-related reactions; thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and infections), respectively. Results: Pharmacokinetic profiles of daratumumab were similar between monotherapy and combination therapy. Covariate analysis identified no clinically important effects on daratumumab exposure, and no dose adjustments were recommended on the basis of these factors. Maximal clinical benefit on PFS was achieved for the majority of patients (approximately 75%) at the 16?mg/kg dose. No apparent relationship was observed between daratumumab exposure and selected adverse events. Conclusion: These data support the recommended 16?mg/kg dose of daratumumab and the respective dosing schedules in the POLLUX and CASTOR pivotal studies.

The advantages of a stable magnified 3-D view, tremor filtering, and motion scaling allow for precise intracorporeal exposure and suturing. Because most surgeries are performed as reconstructive rather than excision procedures, the robotic platform is particularly feasible for the field of pediatric urology. In this review, we summarize the recent viewpoints on RALS, such as pyeloplasty, ureteral reimplantation, bladder neck reconstruction, bladder neck sling, appendicovesicostomy, bladder diverticulectomy, and treatments for ureterocele or ectopic ureters, and we also critically summarize the current status of the literature. Based on our initial experience, RALS is technically feasible for pediatric patients and may be achieved with comparable surgical outcomes. RALS is also associated with reduced morbidity compared to open surgery to conventional laparoscopic surgery. This evolution will offer an alternative in the treatment pediatric patients, along with improved care and patient quality of life. Further large case series and randomized controlled trials that investigate the robotic platform's technological improvements will help to expand indications of RALS in the field of pediatric urology. ? 2018 Japan Society for Endoscopic Surgery, Asia Endosurgery Task Force and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",Children; pediatric; robotic surgery,child; human; laparoscopy; outcome assessment; pediatrics; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; trends; urologic surgery; urology; Child; Humans; Laparoscopy; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pediatrics; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Urologic Surgical Procedures; Urology,2-s2.0-85055077643

However, early immunological events surrounding the priming of HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses remain poorly understood. This study examined the importance of priming location and the relative contribution of endogenous antigen presentation by hepatocytes versus crosspresentation by bone marrow-derived cells to the induction of functional HBVspecific CD8+ T cell responses using the animal models of acute and chronic HBV infection. Functional HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses could be induced to intrahepatically expressed HBV even when T cell homing to the lymphoid tissues was severely suppressed, suggesting that functional priming could occur in the liver. The expansion of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells was significantly reduced in the mice whose major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression was mostly restricted to nonhematopoietic cells, suggesting the importance of crosspresentation by hematopoietic cells in the induction of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. Strikingly, the expansion and cytolytic differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells were reduced even more severely in the mice whose MHC class I expression was restricted to hematopoietic cells. Collectively, these results indicate that cross-presentation is required but relatively inefficient in terms of inducing the cytolytic differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells by itself. Instead, the expansion and functional differentiation of HBV-specific CD8+ T cells are primarily dependent on hepatocellular antigen presentation. IMPORTANCE Hepatitis B virus (HBV) causes acute and chronic hepatitis. Approximately 260 million people are chronically infected with HBV and under an increased risk of developing cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Host immune responses, particularly HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses, largely determine the outcome of HBV infection. It is widely accepted that antigen inexperienced CD8+ T cells should be initially activated by professional antigen-presenting cells (pAPCs) in lymphoid tissues to differentiate into effector CD8+ T cells. However, this notion has not been tested for HBV-specific CD8+ T cells. In this study, we show that HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses can be induced in the liver. Surprisingly, antigen presentation by hepatocytes is more important than cross-presentation by hematopoietic cells for the induction of HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. These results revealed a previously unappreciated role of antigen presentation by hepatocytes in the induction of HBV-specific CD8+ T cell responses. ? 2018 American Society for Microbiology.

Aim: To clarify serial changes in M2BPGi and its association with subsequent hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in NA-treated CHB patients. Methods: We enrolled 384 previously untreated CHB patients who received NAs. Among them, 195 had baseline cirrhosis (n?=?142:48:5 for Child A:B:C). Sera were collected at NA initiation, and after 1 and 2?years. Serum M2BPGi levels were measured and expressed as cut-off index (COI) at different time points. The association between M2BPGi and HCC was evaluated by the Cox proportional hazard model. Results: The median M2BPGi levels significantly decreased from 1.68 COI at baseline, to 1.0 at year 1, and 0.88 at year 2. During median follow-up of 72.7?months, HCC occurred in 37 patients, 36 of whom had cirrhosis. In patients with cirrhosis, baseline M2BPGi level was associated with HCC risk (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.07 per COI; 95% CI, 1.01-1.14) on the multivariable Cox analysis, whereas levels at year 1 or 2 were not independently predictive. A risk score for HCC was developed using baseline M2BPGi, age and body mass index with c statistics of 0.77, 0.79 and 0.87 at 3, 5 and 10?years, respectively. Conclusions: Serum M2BPGi level significantly decreases after NA treatment in CHB patients. Baseline level can be factored into the risk prediction of HCC in NA-treated patients with cirrhosis. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,"antivirus agent; biological marker; carrier protein; glycoprotein; LGALS3BP protein, human; tumor antigen; tumor marker; adult; aged; blood; chronic hepatitis B; cohort analysis; drug effect; female; follow up; glycosylation; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; oral drug administration; prospective study; risk factor; Administration, Oral; Adult; Aged; Antigens, Neoplasm; Antiviral Agents; Biomarkers; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Carrier Proteins; Cohort Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glycoproteins; Glycosylation; Hepatitis B, Chronic; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85054807416

Therefore, we performed a network meta-analysis to assess the effect of available anticoagulant treatments on patient mortality, DIC resolution and the incidence of bleeding complication in patients with septic DIC. Materials and methods: We considered all studies from four recent systematic reviews and searched the PubMed, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases for other studies that investigated anticoagulant treatment for septic DIC using antithrombin, thrombomodulin, heparin, or protease inhibitors in adult critically ill patients. These four anticoagulants and placebo were compared. The primary outcome in this study was patient mortality, and the secondary outcomes were the DIC resolution rate and incidence of bleeding complications. Results: The network meta-analysis included 1340 patients from nine studies. There were no significant differences in the risks of mortality and bleeding complications among all direct comparisons and the network meta-analysis. Using a placebo was associated with a significantly lower rate of DIC resolution, compared to antithrombin in the direct comparison (odds ratio [OR]: 0.20, 95% credible interval [95% CrI]: 0.046–0.81) and in the network meta-analysis (OR: 0.20, 95% CrI: 0.043–0.84). Conclusions: Our study revealed no significant differences in the risks for mortality and bleeding complications when a placebo and all four anticoagulants were compared in septic DIC patients. The results also indicated that antithrombin was associated with a five-fold higher likelihood of DIC resolution, compared to placebo. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Anticoagulant treatment; Disseminated intravascular coagulation; Network meta-analysis; Sepsis,anticoagulant agent; antithrombin; heparin; placebo; proteinase inhibitor; thrombomodulin; anticoagulant agent; thrombomodulin; adult; aged; Article; Bayes theorem; bleeding; cohort analysis; critically ill patient; disease association; disseminated intravascular clotting; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; meta analysis; mortality; priority journal; sepsis; systematic review; bleeding; chemically induced; complication; critical illness; disseminated intravascular clotting; female; middle aged; risk factor; sepsis; Adult; Aged; Anticoagulants; Antithrombins; Critical Illness; Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation; Female; Hemorrhage; Heparin; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Protease Inhibitors; Risk Factors; Sepsis; Thrombomodulin,2-s2.0-85054438230

However, associations between co-resident family members and PPD risk have not been examined. This study investigated whether co-resident family members were associated with risk for PPD during 1 month postpartum among Japanese women, and if these associations were modified by household income and their perceived partner's involvement in childcare. The sample comprised 86,490 women. Data were drawn from the Japan Environment and Children's Study, a large-scale national cohort study started in 2011. Our major predictor was co-resident family members when they registered around the first trimester of the women's pregnancy: partner, parent(s), parent(s)-in-law, or child(ren). The outcome was PPD at 1 month after delivery, assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale. Adjusted odds ratios (OR) for family members and PPD incidence were calculated using multivariable logistic regression analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted by household income and perceived partner's involvement in childcare. Adjusted ORs (95% confidence interval) for PPD for those not living with their partner, parent(s), parent(s)-in-law, or child(ren) compared with those who lived with these family members were 1.21 (1.07–1.37), 1.13 (1.03–1.24), 0.91 (0.84–0.98), and 1.42 (1.31–1.53), respectively. The level of perceived partner's involvement in childcare changed the identified association between family member and PPD. We found that “who a pregnant woman lives with” affects the risk of PPD in the first month postpartum, and high levels of perceived partner's involvement in childcare reduced harmful effects/increased protective effect of family members on PPD incidence. These findings suggested that interventions to increase perceived partner's support for childcare may be effective in preventing PPD, regardless of living situation. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Family; Japan; Longitudinal studies; Postpartum depression; Social environment,"child care; child health; household income; psychology; risk factor; adult; Article; child; child care; child parent relation; cohabiting person; cohort analysis; controlled study; Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale; environmental factor; family relation; family study; female; first trimester pregnancy; household income; human; incidence; Japan; Japanese (people); major clinical study; obstetric delivery; parent-in-law; postnatal depression; prediction; pregnant woman; puerperium; risk assessment; risk factor; family relation; odds ratio; postnatal depression; psychology; risk factor; statistical model; Japan; Adult; Cohort Studies; Depression, Postpartum; Family Relations; Female; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Logistic Models; Odds Ratio; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85054196782

However, the roles of the MFG-E8 that is expressed by cancer cells have not yet been fully examined. Expression of MFG-E8 was examined using immunohistochemistry in surgical samples from 134 patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The relationships between MFG-E8 expression levels and clinicopathological factors, including tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, were evaluated. High MFG-E8 expression was observed in 23.9% of the patients. The patients with tumors highly expressing MFG-E8 had a significantly higher percentage of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) history (P?&lt;.0001) and shorter relapse-free survival (P?=?0.012) and overall survival (OS; P?=.0047). On subgroup analysis, according to NAC history, patients with high MFG-E8 expression had significantly shorter relapse-free survival (P?=.027) and OS (P?=.0039) only when they had been treated with NAC. Furthermore, tumors with high MFG-E8 expression had a significantly lower ratio of CD8+ T cells/regulatory T cells in tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (P?=.042) only in the patients treated with NAC, and those with a lower ratio had a shorter OS (P?=.026). High MFG-E8 expression was also found to be an independent prognostic factor in multivariate analysis. The abundant MFG-E8 expression in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma might have a negative influence on the long-term survival of patients after chemotherapy by affecting T-cell regulation in the tumor microenvironment. ? 2018 The Authors.

The internal mammary lymphatic vessel runs around the internal mammary artery and veins with IMLN in the parasternal intercostal spaces. IMLN metastasis, which forms a part of clinical TNM staging, may negatively affect the prognosis of primary breast cancer patients. IMLN metastasis is clinically detected using ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and 18F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography computed tomography. The uptake of radioactive tracers in IMLN with clinically negative axillary lymph nodes is often identified using sentinel lymph node mapping (SLNM) in primary breast cancer patients. The indication for IMLN biopsy or resection that is clinically detected or visualized using SLNM is controversial. The clinically suspicious IMLN may be considered for ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration. First IMLN recurrence needs to be biopsied. Irradiation of the breast, chest wall, and/or regional nodal irradiation, including IMLN, following lumpectomy or postmastectomy is recommended. Although radiation therapy for IMLN recurrence may improve clinical outcomes, it is also associated with pulmonary and cardiac toxicities.

Objectives: To examine the in-hospital outcomes of patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD), dialysis, and kidney transplant undergoing spinal fusion on a national level. Summary of Background Data: Patients with advanced CKD have been living longer with the support and improvement of medical treatment, dialysis, and organ transplant. Some of those patients undergo spinal fusion surgery. However, there is limited information regarding the outcomes of patients with advanced CKD, dialysis, and kidney transplant, undergoing spinal fusion. Methods: Clinical data were derived from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 2000 and 2009. Patients who underwent spinal fusion were identified and divided into 4 groups: those with advanced CKD, dialysis, and kidney transplant, and those without advanced CKD. Data regarding, patient-system and health care system-related characteristics, comorbidities, in-hospital complications, and mortality were retrieved and analyzed. In-hospital outcomes were compared between the groups and analyzed with the use of multivariate logistic regression. Results: Among the all groups, overall in-hospital complications rate was the highest (42.0%) for patients with advanced CKD and in-hospital mortality rate was the highest (5.2%) for those with dialysis, undergoing spinal fusion. Patients with dialysis had 8.7 and 9.5 times higher risk of in-hospital mortality compared with those with kidney transplant and those without advanced CKD. Conclusions: Patients with advanced CKD, dialysis, and kidney transplant had significant higher rates and risks of in-hospital morbidity or mortality than those without advanced CKD, undergoing spinal fusion. Particularly, patients with dialysis undergoing spinal fusion need to be informed with high mortality risk. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Instrument fragility necessitates eventual repair, rendering scopes inaccessible during refurbishment. We conducted a multi-institutional prospective cohort study to identify perioperative factors influencing flexible ureteroscope durability. Patients undergoing flexible ureteroscopy (URS) at six United States endourology centers were enrolled between August 2014 and June 2015. Surgeon self-reported concern and satisfaction with scope performance as well as upward and downward angles of deflection for each scope tip were measured before and after each procedure. The need for scope repair was determined by the operating surgeon at the time of the procedure and recorded. 424 URS cases using 74 flexible ureteroscopes were identified. Scope repair was required in 28 cases (6.6%) involving 26 scopes (35.1%). Upon univariate analysis, shorter patient height, absence of guidewire use, presence of a ureteral access sheath (UAS), longer procedure time, larger stone size, lithotrite type, surgeon training level, and self-reported concern were associated with scope repair. Upon multivariate analysis, UAS use (OR?=?2.53, p?=?0.005) and degree loss of scope upward flexion during a case (OR?=?1.02, p?=?0.03) increased the odds of a scope needing repair while the use of safety guidewire decreased the odds of a scope repair (OR?=?0.50, p?=?0.045). Lithotrite use and surgeon concern were associated with degree loss of scope upward flexion. The use of a UAS, absence of a safety guidewire, and the loss of upward ureteroscope flexion should be considered when evaluating means of optimizing reusable ureteroscope durability. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Durability; Reusable flexible ureteroscope; Scope repair; Ureteral access sheath; Ureteroscopy,adult; Article; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; morbidity; patient safety; patient satisfaction; perioperative period; pragmatic trial; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; self report; surgeon; surgical training; ureter cancer; ureter stricture; ureteroscopy; urolithiasis; clinical trial; device failure analysis; devices; diagnostic imaging; equipment design; lithotripsy; multicenter study; procedures; prospective study; United States; ureter; ureteroscope; ureteroscopy; urolithiasis; young adult; Adult; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Female; Humans; Lithotripsy; Male; Perioperative Period; Prospective Studies; United States; Ureter; Ureteroscopes; Ureteroscopy; Urolithiasis; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85037621941

The receptors for Reelin, apolipoprotein E receptor 2 and very low-density lipoprotein receptor, belong to the low-density lipoprotein receptor family, but it is not known whether Reelin is involved in the brain lipid metabolism. In the present study, we performed lipidomic analysis of the cerebral cortex of wild-type and Reelin-deficient (reeler) mice, and found that reeler mice exhibited several compositional changes in phospholipids. First, the ratio of phospholipids containing one saturated fatty acid (FA) and one docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) or arachidonic acid (ARA) decreased. Secondly, the ratio of phospholipids containing one monounsaturated FA (MUFA) and one DHA or ARA increased. Thirdly, the ratio of phospholipids containing 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid, or Mead acid (MA), increased. Finally, the expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase-1 (SCD-1) increased. As the increase of MA is seen as an index of polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) deficiency, and the expression of SCD-1 is suppressed by PUFA, these results strongly suggest that the loss of Reelin leads to PUFA deficiency. Hence, MUFA and MA are synthesized in response to this deficiency, in part by inducing SCD-1 expression. This is the first report of changes of FA composition in the reeler mouse brain and provides a basis for further investigating the new role of Reelin in the development and function of the brain. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,"5,8,11 icosatrienoic acid; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; arachidonic acid; docosahexaenoic acid; monounsaturated fatty acid; phospholipid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; reelin; saturated fatty acid; 5,8,11 icosatrienoic acid; acyl coenzyme A desaturase; arachidonic acid; diroleuton; docosahexaenoic acid; fatty acid; lipid; nerve cell adhesion molecule; nerve protein; phospholipid; reelin protein; Scd1 protein, mouse; scleroprotein; serine proteinase; adult; animal tissue; Article; brain; brain cortex; brain function; controlled study; gene knockdown; glia cell; human; human tissue; lipid analysis; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; mouse; nonhuman; phospholipid blood level; priority journal; protein blood level; protein deficiency; protein expression; reeler mouse; wild type; analogs and derivatives; animal; brain; chemistry; deficiency; embryology; gene expression regulation; genetics; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; metabolism; mouse mutant; 8,11,14-Eicosatrienoic Acid; Animals; Arachidonic Acid; Brain; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Docosahexaenoic Acids; Extracellular Matrix Proteins; Fatty Acids; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Mice, Inbred ICR; Mice, Neurologic Mutants; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Phospholipids; Serine Endopeptidases; Stearoyl-CoA Desaturase",2-s2.0-85053712871

The present study reports the interim results of these trials. Methods: Fifty-five patients with histologically confirmed stage I NSCLC (IA in 33 patients and IB in 22 patients; inoperable in 21 patients and operable in 34 patients) who received IGPT between July 2013 and February 2017 were analyzed. The median patient age was 71 years (range: 48-88 years). IGPT with fiducial metallic marker matching was performed for suitable patients, and a respiratory gating method for motion management was used for all treatments. Peripherally located tumors were treated with 66 Gy relative biological effectiveness equivalents (Gy(RBE)) in 10 fractions (n = 49) and centrally located tumors were treated with 72.6 Gy(RBE) in 22 fractions (n = 6). Treatment associated toxicities were evaluated using Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (v.4.0). Results: Median follow-up was 35 months (range: 12-54 months) for survivors. For all patients, the 3-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and local control rates were 87% (95% confidence interval: 73-94%), 74% (58-85%), and 96% (83-99%), respectively. Fiducial marker matching was used in 39 patients (71%). Grade 2 toxicities observed were radiation pneumonitis in 5 patients (9%), rib fracture in 2 (4%), and chest wall pain in 5 (9%). There were no grade 3 or higher acute or late toxicities. Conclusions: IGPT appears to be effective and well tolerated for all patients with stage I NSCLC.

Method: We surveyed 1967 patients receiving long-term inpatient psychiatric care. Patients were further categorized into an old long-stay group (n = 892, >5 years in hospitals) and a new long-stay group (n = 1075, 1–5 years in hospitals). We obtained responses for all the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health items in domain b (Body Functions) and domain d (Activities and Participation). We estimated weighted means for each item using the propensity score to adjust for confounding factors. Results: Responses were received from 307 hospitals (response rate of hospitals: 25.5%). Cognitive and social functioning in the old long-stay group was more severely impaired than in the new long-stay group. No statistically significant differences were observed regarding the International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health items associated with basic activities of daily living between the two groups. Conclusion: Combined therapy consisting of cognitive remediation and rehabilitation on social functioning for this patient population should be started from the early stage of hospitalization. Non-restrictive, independent environments may also be optimal for this patient population.Implications for rehabilitation Rehabilitation of cognitive and social functioning for patients requiring long-term inpatient psychiatric care should be started in the early stages of hospitalization.

Therefore, we explored naturally occurring compounds that induce beige adipocytes by screening for activity to induce mRNA expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in stromal vascular fraction (SVF) cells cultured in beige adipocyte differentiation medium. Through screening, p-synephrine, a compound isolated from Citrus unshiu Marcov., was found to be an active compound that increased UCP1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner from a concentration of 3.12 ?M, which induced morphological changes specific for beige adipocytes. Similar effects were also observed in SVF cells prepared from db/db obese mice. While investigating the underlying mechanism of p-synephrine-induced beige adipocyte differentiation, we found that the effects of p-synephrine were abolished by the β3-adrenoceptor antagonist SR58894. Intriguingly, p-synephrine increased UCP1 mRNA levels in SVF cells cultured in beige adipocyte differentiation medium lacking insulin to an extent different from those by the β-agonist isoprenaline. Furthermore, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 decreased isoprenaline-induced UCP1 mRNA levels in the early phase of beige adipocyte differentiation and p-synephrine-induced UCP1 mRNA levels in fully differentiated beige adipocytes. Thus, p-synephrine appears to elicit signals via β3-adrenoceptor combined with some part of the insulin signaling pathway, finally resulting in efficient stimulation of beige adipocyte differentiation with the support of certain beige adipocyte differentiation-inducing factors. The present results suggest the potential of p-synephrine for prophylaxis and treatment of obesity and its associated diseases. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Beige adipocyte; Citrus unshiu Marcov; Insulin-like activity; p-synephrine; β3-adrenoceptor,"2 morpholino 8 phenylchromone; 4 synephrine; beta 3 adrenergic receptor blocking agent; beta 3 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; insulin; isoprenaline; messenger RNA; sr 58894; unclassified drug; uncoupling protein 1; beta 3 adrenergic receptor; beta 3 adrenergic receptor stimulating agent; insulin; oxedrine; uncoupling protein 1; adipogenesis; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; beige adipocyte; cell differentiation; cell maturation; cell stimulation; cell structure; concentration response; controlled study; drug isolation; drug mechanism; drug screening; female; gene expression; gene induction; insulin signaling; intracellular signaling; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; priority journal; satsuma; stroma cell; stromal vascular fraction cell; animal; beige adipocyte; C57BL mouse; cell differentiation; cytology; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; signal transduction; Adipocytes, Beige; Adrenergic beta-3 Receptor Agonists; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Gene Expression Regulation; Insulin; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Receptors, Adrenergic, beta-3; Signal Transduction; Synephrine; Uncoupling Protein 1",2-s2.0-85052160438

Pioglitazone improves vascular dysfunction and prevents coronary atherosclerosis, mainly via anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic effects by enhancing adiponectin production in addition to antihyperglycemic effects, thus suggesting that pioglitazone attenuates cardiovascular events in patients with mild (HbA1c levels < 6·5%) diabetes mellitus (DM). Therefore, we evaluated the effects of pioglitazone on cardiovascular events in patients with both previous MI and mild DM. Methods: In this multicentre, prospective, randomised, open, blinded-endpoint trial, we randomly assigned 630 patients with mild DM with a history of MI to undergo either DM therapy with (pioglitazone group) or without (control group) pioglitazone. DM was diagnosed using the 75-g oral glucose tolerance test, and mild DM was defined if HbA1c level was < 6·5%. The primary endpoint was the composite of cardiovascular death and hospitalisation caused by acute MI, unstable angina, coronary revascularisation (including percutaneous coronary intervention and cardiac bypass surgery), and stroke. Findings: HbA1C levels were 5·9 and 5·8% (p = 0·71) at baseline and 6·0 and 5·8% (p < 0·01) at 2 years for the control and pioglitazone groups, respectively. The primary endpoint was observed in 14·2% and 14·1% patients in the control and pioglitazone groups during two years (95% confidential interval (CI):0.662–1·526, p = 0·98), respectively; the incidence of MI and cerebral infarction was 0·3% and 2·2% (95%CI: 0·786–32·415, p = 0·09) and 1·0% and 0·3% (95%CI: 0·051–3·662, p = 0·44), respectively. Post-hoc analyses of the 7-year observation period showed that these trends were comparable (21·9% and 19·2% in the control and pioglitazone groups, 95%CI: 0.618–1·237, p = 0·45). Interpretation: Pioglitazone could not reduce the occurrence of cardiovascular events in patients with mild DM and previous MI. ? 2018",Blood glucose-lowering; Cardiovascular events; Diabetes mellitus; Myocardial infarction; Pioglitazone; PROBE study,hemoglobin A1c; pioglitazone; acute heart infarction; adult; aged; Article; bladder cancer; brain infarction; cardiovascular disease; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; clinical study; confidence interval; controlled study; coronary artery bypass surgery; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; drug dose increase; drug dose reduction; edema; endocrine disease; eye disease; female; gastrointestinal disease; heart disease; heart failure; heart muscle revascularization; heart protection; heart reinfarction; hospitalization; human; hypoglycemia; incidence; infection; Japan; kidney disease; liver disease; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; medical society; metabolic disorder; multicenter study; neoplasm; neurologic disease; nutritional disorder; oral glucose tolerance test; percutaneous coronary intervention; post hoc analysis; practice guideline; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract disease; secondary prevention; single blind procedure; treatment response; unstable angina pectoris; urinary tract disease; vascular disease,2-s2.0-85064151391

This study aimed to confirm that finding, determine the optimal dose rate for growth promotion, and compare low- and high-dose-rate irradiation in silkworms, while also investigating the effects of the radiation-emitting sheet on growth and tumor transplantability in mice. Silkworm eggs were placed on low-dose-emitting sheets with 4 different dose rates (γ-ray rate: 1.7 -22.4 μSv/hour) or on control sheets. The other groups of silkworm larvae received single whole-body X-irradiation (0.1-50 Gy), and subsequent body weight changes were monitored. Starting at 3 weeks old, Balb/c mice were bred on the same sheets, and body weight change was measured. Seven weeks later, the mice were used to investigate the transplantability of EMT6 tumor cells cultured in vitro. The silkworms bred on the 13.4- and 22.4-μSv/hour sheets became larger than the control. Single 50-Gy irradiation suppressed the growth of silkworms. An increase in the time to EMT6 tumor development was observed in low-dose-rate-irradiated mice. This study confirmed growth promotion of silkworms by continuous low-dose radiation and demonstrated growth suppression at a high dose rate.

We investigated the relation between patient background and test values before nivolumab administration and skin reactions. From February 2016 to February 2017, we evaluated the clinical outcomes of 21 patients who were administered nivolumab. Patients were divided into 2 groups: 3 cases of skin reactions to nivolumab (skin reaction group) and 18 cases without skin reactions to nivolumab (non-skin reaction group). In the skin reaction group, the numbers of eosinophils and basophils before nivolumab administration were significantly higher than those in the non-skin reaction group (p=0.0015 and p=0.0075, respectively). It was suggested that the numbers of eosinophils or basophils before nivolumab administration might be associated with the appearance of skin reactions. ? 2018 Japanese Journal of Cancer and Chemotherapy Publishers Inc.

Methods: We validated TUG as an outcome measure of lower limb joint surgery and compared it with changes in patient-reported outcomes, including the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) and European Quality of life scale with five dimensions (EQ-5D). Changes in these outcomes were compared by performed surgery and by achievement of the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for EQ-5D using univariate analysis of variance. Associations between TUG and HAQ remission (HAQ-DI ?0.5) were determined using logistic regression analysis. Cut-off values of TUG at baseline and 6?months after surgery for HAQ remission were determined using receiver operating characteristic curves. Results: A total of 126 patients were analyzed. Mean age, HAQ-DI, and TUG were 65.4?years, 1.036, and 12.8?seconds, respectively. After surgery, patients showed improvements in TUG as well as HAQ-DI. TUG at 6?months after surgery was significantly associated with HAQ remission (adjusted OR: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.65-0.93). TUG cut-off values at baseline and 6?months after surgery for achieving HAQ remission were 12.1 and 8.8?seconds, respectively. Significant improvements in TUG (?TUG, 3.7?seconds) were associated with achievement of the MCID for EQ-5D (?0.05) at 6?months after surgery. Conclusion: Timed Up and Go test is a useful tool for assessing the outcome of lower limb joint surgery in RA patients. We propose that TUG ?9?seconds could be an objective target for achieving good physical function after lower limb joint surgery. ? 2018 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",joint surgery; outcome measure; physical function; rheumatoid arthritis; Timed Up and Go test,"C reactive protein; methotrexate; adult; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; body mass; cohort analysis; controlled study; DAS28; disease activity score; disease duration; European Quality of life scale with five dimension; female; Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index; human; joint surgery; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; musculoskeletal disease assessment; observational study; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; rheumatoid arthritis; sensitivity and specificity; timed up and go test; total knee arthroplasty; visual analog scale; aged; biomechanics; clinical trial; convalescence; disability; health status; Japan; joint; joint characteristics and functions; pathophysiology; patient-reported outcome; predictive value; reproducibility; rheumatoid arthritis; time factor; treatment outcome; validation study; Aged; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Biomechanical Phenomena; Disability Evaluation; Female; Health Status; Humans; Japan; Joints; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Range of Motion, Articular; Recovery of Function; Reproducibility of Results; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85055152379

Objective: To explore whether opioids are associated with the overall survival (OS) of patients with incurable nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Design: Prospective cohort study of patients with NSCLC. Setting: We investigated patients newly diagnosed with advanced or post-operative recurrent NSCLC between April 2013 and December 2015 at a single institute. Measurements: We evaluated OS, opioid requirements, opioid doses, pain levels, and prognostic factors of advanced NSCLC. The effects of variables on survival were analyzed using univariable and multivariable models. Patients were stratified according to oral morphine equivalents (OMEs)/day (<60 or ?60 mg) to assess the association between opioid dose and OS. Results: We analyzed 150 patients, including 64 who received opioid treatment during follow-up. The median OS was 242 days in the opioid group and 627 days in the no-opioid group (log-rank p < 0.001). Multivariable models revealed that the opioid requirement was an independent predictor of shorter OS, after adjustment for prognostic variables, including sex, histology, stage, history of systemic chemotherapy, and performance status (hazard ratio 1.73, 95% confidence interval 1.137-2.631). There was no significant difference in OS between patients who received ?60 mg OME/day for 250 days versus <60 OME/day for 242 days. Conclusions: The opioid dose does not shorten the survival of patients with advanced NSCLC. The opioid requirement is associated with shorter survival when opioids are administered any time during the clinical course, independent of the influence of other key factors. ? 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",analgesics; neoplasm; opioid; pain; survival,"duloxetine; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; opiate; paracetamol; pregabalin; narcotic analgesic agent; adjuvant therapy; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer pain; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; cohort analysis; dose response; female; human; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; pain intensity; prospective study; lung tumor; middle aged; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; prognosis; survival analysis; Adult; Aged; Analgesics, Opioid; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-85054888124

This study aimed at evaluating the performance of WFA+-M2BP in the diagnosis of HCC in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Methods: The WFA+-M2BP levels were measured in stored samples collected at initial diagnosis of 150 patients with HBV-related HCC and 150 age- and gender-matched patients with non-malignant chronic HBV infection. Results: Patients with HCC had higher levels of WFA+-M2BP than those without HCC (3.9 [1.5–20.6] vs. 1.6 [0.4–9.3] cut-off index [COI], P?&lt; 0.001). In the HCC group, WFA+-M2BP levels correlated with Child–Pugh classification but did not correlate with HBV markers, α-fetoprotein (AFP), or Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage. The areas under the curve (AUROC) for differentiating HCC from non-HCC were 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.89–0.95; P &lt; 0.001) for WFA+-M2BP, 0.90 (95% CI, 0.87–0.94; P &lt; 0.001) for AFP, and 0.97 (95% CI, 0.95–0.98; P &lt; 0.001) for the combination of both markers. At the optimal cut-off (2.4 COI), WFA+-M2BP had sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 79.3%, 91.3%, and 85.3%, respectively. The WFA+-M2BP marker was superior to AFP in differentiating early-stage HCC (BCLC stages 0 and A) from cirrhosis with AUROC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.68–0.91; P &lt; 0.001) and 0.73 (95% CI, 0.60–0.86; P = 0.002), respectively. By univariate analysis, elevated WFA+-M2BP (?4.0 COI) was correlated with poor overall survival in patients with HCC. Conclusions: Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive?M2BP showed a better diagnostic performance than AFP in detecting early-stage HCC.

The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that PPH is prevented by slowing the infusion rate of enteral nutrition through tube feeding and by avoiding the administration of antihypertensive drugs just before the start of tube feeding. Methods: Participants were older people receiving tube feeding through gastrostomy who used a geriatric health services facility (n = 12; mean age 79.8 years). Changes in blood pressure during and after enteric nutrient infusion lasting for 1 or 2 h were investigated with or without the administration of antihypertensive drugs just before the start of tube feeding. Results: When enteric nutrient was infused for 1 h, after the administration of antihypertensive drugs, nine of 12 participants showed PPH with a maximal reduction in systolic blood pressure of 37.6 ± 6.5 mmHg. Although PPH was not prevented by avoiding drug administration before infusion (maximal blood pressure reduction 30.2 ± 5.0 mmHg) or by extending the infusion time to 2 h (26.5 ± 7.5 mmHg), the combination of the two actions prevented PPH and reduced the postprandial fall in systolic blood pressure to 17.6 ± 5.8 mmHg. Conclusions: The prevalence of PPH in older people receiving tube feeding was 75%. Slowing the enteric nutrient infusion rate combined with avoiding antihypertensive drugs just before the infusion was useful for preventing PPH.

This study investigated whether dietary salt intake predicts deterioration of kidney function in the general population. Methods: In all, 12 126 subjects with a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR ?60 mL/min per 1.73m2) attending an annual check-up were enrolled in the study and were followed-up for a median of 1754 days; the endpoint was the development of impaired kidney function (eGFR &lt; 60 mL/min per 1.73m2). Individual salt intake was estimated using spot urine analysis. Results: At baseline, mean (± SD) salt intake and eGFR were 10.6 ± 3.4 g/day and 80.8 ± 12.9 mL/min per 1.73m2, respectively. During the follow-up period, 1384 subjects (25.2 per 1000 person-years) developed impaired kidney function. Multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis revealed salt intake as a significant predictor of the new onset of kidney impairment (hazard ratio 1.045; 95% confidence interval 1.025-1.065). Subjects were divided into two groups based on salt intake; the incidence of impaired kidney function was higher in the group with high than low salt intake (P &lt; 0.001, log-rank test). Multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis indicated a 29% increased risk of developing impaired kidney function in the high-salt group. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed a significant correlation between salt intake and yearly decline in eGFR (β = 0.060, P &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Salt intake is associated with the development of impaired kidney function in the general population, independent of its effects on blood pressure.

Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 5-cm tumor in segment 6 of her right lung and an enlarged subcarinal lymph node, suggesting metastasis. The lung tumor was diagnosed as adenocarcinoma by a CT-guided percutaneous needle biopsy. She was referred to our hospital and underwent right lower lobectomy with lymph node dissection (ND2a-2). A histopathological examination of the tumor showed a biphasic proliferation made of carcinomatous and sarcomatous components. The carcinomatous component consisted of glandular structures of atypical cells that possessed chromatin-rich nuclear and clear cytoplasm, confirming high-grade fetal adenocarcinoma. The sarcomatous component consisted of immature spindle cells that differentiated into chondrosarcoma. Immunohistochemically, the glandular structures expressed membranous beta-catenin, and the ultimate diagnosis was blastomatoid variant of pulmonary carcinosarcoma. She received four courses of cisplatin plus vinorelbine as adjuvant chemotherapy and remained alive with neither recurrence nor distant metastasis at two and a half years after the operation.

To overcome these shortcomings, novel NS5A inhibitors have been developed and approved for clinical application. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-viral effect of novel NS5A inhibitors (derivatives of odalasvir) on HCV genotype 2 strains in a cell culture system. Chimeric JFH-1 viruses replaced with NS5A of genotypes 1 and 2 were utilized to assess the genotype-specific potencies of NS5A inhibitors. We also examined full-genome infectious clones of JFH-1, J6cc, and J8cc to confirm the effects of NS5A inhibitors on genotype 2 strains. All chimeric viruses were capable of replication at similar levels in cell culture. We examined the anti-viral effects of derivatives of the novel NS5A inhibitor and compared with the first-generation NS5A inhibitor, daclatasvir (DCV). These compounds inhibited replication of chimeric JFH-1 viruses with NS5A of genotypes 1 and 2 at low concentrations in comparison with DCV.

We observed some cases in which simultaneous flattening of hemorrhagic pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) occurred after prone posturing. This study evaluated the impact of pneumatic displacement using tPA to treat PEDs and visual outcomes in eyes with SMHs secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: This retrospective analysis reviewed the medical records of 32 patients (33 eyes) who underwent pneumatic displacement for AMD-associated SMHs. The SMHs were related to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) in 24 eyes and typical AMD in nine eyes and treated with intravitreal injection of SF6 gas with tPA. We assessed the postoperative best-corrected visual acuities (BCVAs), prevalence and flattening rates of the PEDs, and the number of additional treatments. Results: The mean follow-up period was 35.4 ± 19.8?months. The BCVAs improved significantly in eyes with PCV compared with eyes with typical AMD. Thirty-one (93.9%) of 33 eyes had an accompanying PED. The PEDs flattened in 14 (58.3%) of 24 eyes with PCV but in only one (14.3%) of seven eyes with typical AMD (p = 0.04). A mean of one additional treatment was administered during the first year in 15 eyes with flattened PEDs, which was significantly (p &lt; 0.05) fewer than the 3.6 additional treatments in 16 eyes with persistent PEDs. Conclusions: PEDs often accompany SMHs secondary to neovascular AMD. Pneumatic displacement of the SMHs using tPA unexpectedly flattened the PEDs, especially in eyes with PCV, and was associated with fewer additional treatments. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Age-related macular degeneration; Pneumatic displacement; Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; Submacular hemorrhage; Sulfur hexafluoride; Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA),"aflibercept; photosensitizing agent; ranibizumab; sulfur hexafluoride; tissue plasminogen activator; fibrinolytic agent; sulfur hexafluoride; tissue plasminogen activator; adult; aged; antiangiogenic therapy; Article; best corrected visual acuity; clinical article; clinical evaluation; clinical observation; clinical outcome; clinical trial; disease association; female; follow up; human; male; photodynamic therapy; polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; postoperative period; prevalence; priority journal; prone position; retina detachment; retina macula hemorrhage; retrospective study; submacular hemorrhage; treatment response; vision; wet macular degeneration; complication; endotamponade; eye fundus; fluorescence angiography; intravitreal drug administration; middle aged; optical coherence tomography; procedures; retina detachment; retina hemorrhage; very elderly; visual acuity; wet macular degeneration; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Endotamponade; Female; Fibrinolytic Agents; Fluorescein Angiography; Follow-Up Studies; Fundus Oculi; Humans; Intravitreal Injections; Male; Middle Aged; Retinal Detachment; Retinal Hemorrhage; Retrospective Studies; Sulfur Hexafluoride; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Visual Acuity; Wet Macular Degeneration",2-s2.0-85049228142

However, few studies have examined which aspects of BA are most contributory to its efficacy. Methods: This is a secondary analysis of a 9-week randomized controlled trial of smartphone CBT for patients with major depression. Depression severity was measured at baseline and at end of treatment by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. All aspects of behavioral activation tasks that the participants had engaged in, including their expected mastery and pleasure and obtained mastery and pleasure, were recorded in the web server. We examined their contribution to improvement in depression as simple correlations and in stepwise multivariable linear regression. Results: Among the 78 patients who completed at least one behavioral experiment, all aspects of expected or achieved mastery or pleasure correlated with change in depression severity. Discrepancy between the expectation and achievement, representing unexpected gain in mastery or pleasure, was not correlated. In stepwise regression, expected mastery and pleasure, especially the maximum level of the latter, emerged as the strongest contributing factors. Limitations: The study is observational and cannot deduce cause-effect relationships. Conclusions: It may be the expected and continued sense of pleasure in planning activities that are most meaningful and rewarding to individuals, and not the simple level or amount of obtained pleasure, that contributes to the efficacy of BA. ? 2018",Behavior activation; Cognitive behavior therapy; Internet; Major depressive disorder,achievement; adult; Article; behavioral activation; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; dependent variable; depression assessment; emotion; expectation; female; human; major clinical study; major depression; male; mastery; mobile application; multicenter study; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; pleasure; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; secondary analysis; cognitive behavioral therapy; depression; Japan; motivation; procedures; psychology; randomized controlled trial (topic); smartphone; telemedicine; treatment outcome; Adult; Cognitive Behavioral Therapy; Depression; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Motivation; Pleasure; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Smartphone; Telemedicine; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85048253837

Method: In this multicenter retrospective study, we reviewed data on patients under BSC who underwent endoscopic SEMS placement to treat malignant GOO without chemotherapy. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the procedure. Results: We enrolled a total of 208 patients. SEMS placement was technically successful in 207 (99.5%) and clinically successful in 164 (78.8%). The mean procedure time was 25.6 ± 2.8?min. Stent dysfunction later developed in 30 (14.4%) patients, of whom 90% (27/30) underwent reintervention. The procedure-related mortality rate was 1.44%; all deaths were due to pneumonia. Subgroup analysis by Karnofsky performance status (KPS) revealed that neither technical success, stent dysfunction, reintervention rate, procedure-related pneumonia or death, nor death within 14?days differed between patients with good and poor KPS. However, the clinical success rate and the median survival time were significantly lower and shorter, respectively, in those with poor KPS (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Duodenal SEMS placement is an effective palliative treatment for malignant GOO in BSC patients. Although the GOO score did not dramatically improve in patients with poor KPS, the procedure was safe and palliatively feasible. Procedure-related pneumonia was fatal; thus, it is essential to proceed with great caution.

Since previous clinical studies have demonstrated a relationship between globus phayrngeus and GERD, however, no reported study on the relation between globus pharyngeus, sleep disorders including OSA, and GERD. Methods: Seventeen patients underwent general and otorhinolaryngological examinations and responded to several questionnaires (ESS, PSQI, HADS, and Globus pharyngeus VAS score) at their first visit, and underwent a gastroesophageal test for 24-h pH monitoring and in-laboratory PSG one to two months later. Results: No significant differences were seen in ESS, PSQI, or HADS scores between the groups. The acid exposure time was not significantly different among the groups. The percentage of esophageal reflux time was higher than the percentage of laryngopharyngeal reflux time through the total time as well as the supine period. This indicated that GERD occurred more frequently than laryngopharyngeal reflux. The entire results showed concurrent OSA in 10 cases (59%) and concurrent GERD in 7 cases (41%). The cases with OSA were treated by CPAP or oral appliance, and those treatments were effective for globus pharyngeus. Conclusion: Although the relation between OSA and globus phayngeus is still controversial, these findings suggest that OSA may be a previously undetected cause of globus pharyngeus. By improving OSA, it may offer an additional option of treatment for those globus pharyngeus cases combined with OSA. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",CPAP; GERD; Globus pharyngeus; OSA; pH monitor; PSG,"adult; aged; Article; clinical article; cross-sectional study; Epworth sleepiness scale; esophageal pH monitoring; female; gastroesophageal reflux; globus pharyngeus; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; laryngopharyngeal reflux; male; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; polysomnography; positive end expiratory pressure; sleep disordered breathing; throat disease; visual analog scale; case control study; digestive system examination; esophageal pH monitoring; gastroesophageal reflux; hypopharynx; laryngopharyngeal reflux; middle aged; pathophysiology; pharynx disease; polysomnography; questionnaire; sleep disordered breathing; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diagnostic Techniques, Digestive System; Esophageal pH Monitoring; Female; Gastroesophageal Reflux; Humans; Hypopharynx; Laryngopharyngeal Reflux; Male; Middle Aged; Pharyngeal Diseases; Polysomnography; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85043378201

Materials and methods: Ultrasonic images of 70 hips of 35 newborns who were screened by ultrasonography using the Graf method, were evaluated. The images were acquired by two inexperienced examiners who attended the training course. The inter- and intra-examiner measurement errors as well as reproducibility were calculated based on the images obtained. Results: The intra-examiner measurement error in the acquired images of the same hip was minor. The inter-examiner measurement error was also small. The intra- and inter-examiner agreements of the Graf classification were high. The intra-examiner reproducibility of the acquired ultrasonic images was substantial, and the inter-examiner reproducibility was almost perfect. Conclusions: Our results demonstrated that inexperienced examiners could obtain ultrasonic infant hip joint images with minor differences and high reproducibility after the training course.

Although WE has been recognized in cancer patients, it can be overlooked because many patients do not exhibit symptoms that are typical of WE, such as delirium, ataxia, or ocular palsy. Furthermore, outpatients with WE who intermittently present at psycho-oncology clinics have not been described as far as we can ascertain.Method This report describes two patients who did not exhibit the complete classic triad of symptoms among a series with cancer and WE, and who attended a psycho-oncology outpatient clinic.Result Case 1, a 76-year-old woman with pancreatic cancer and liver metastasis, periodically attended a psycho-oncology outpatient clinic. She presented with delirium and ataxia as well as appetite loss that had persisted for 8 weeks. We suspected WE, which was confirmed by low serum thiamine levels and the disappearance of delirium after thiamine administration. Case 2, a 79-year-old man with advanced stomach cancer, was referred to a psycho-oncology outpatient clinic with depression that had persisted for about 1 month. He also had appetite loss that had persisted for several weeks. He became delirious during the first visit to the outpatient clinic. Our initial suspicion of WE was confirmed by low serum thiamine levels and the disappearance of delirium after thiamine administration. The key indicator of a diagnosis of WE in both patients was appetite loss.Significance of results This report emphasizes awareness of WE in the outpatient setting, even when patients do not exhibit the classical triad of WE. Appetite loss might be the key to a diagnosis of WE in the absence of other causes of delirium. ?

Methods: We collected data on demographics, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and associations between TUG and HAQ-DI and other patient-reported outcomes, including European Quality of life scale (EQ-5D) were determined. Cut-off values of TUG for HAQ remission (HAQ-DI ?0.5), normal HAQ (HAQ-DI ?0.25), and the absence of disability in each HAQ-DI category were also determined by age. Results: A total of 435 patients were enrolled and analyzed. Mean age was 64.2 years, mean disease duration was 17.1 years, mean HAQ-DI was 1.14, and mean TUG was 11.1 sec. TUG was significantly correlated with aging, EQ-5D, and HAQ-DI categories related to lower limb function (arising, walking, reach and activity). After adjusting for age and sex, mean TUG values were 9.0 sec (95% CI, 7.7–10.3) in patients with HAQ remission and 8.7 sec (7.4–10.4) in those with normal HAQ. By age, mean TUG values for HAQ remission were 7.2 sec (5.9–8.5) in young patients (?61 years), 9.1 sec (7.6–10.5) in middle-aged patients (62–70 years) and 10.0 sec (5.7–14.2) in old patients (?71 years). Conclusion: TUG was significantly associated with functional impairment and aging in patients with long-standing RA.

Therefore, controlling osteoclast differentiation and function has been considered a promising therapeutic strategy. Here, we show that necrostatin (Nec)-7, an inhibitor of programmed necrosis, strongly suppressed receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclastogenesis and bone resorption, without compromising macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-supported survival and growth of osteoclast precursor cells. Accordingly, Nec-7 significantly decreased the levels of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenic marker genes, such as cathepsin K. Mechanistically, Nec-7 neither affected MAPK nor NF-κB activation; however, it strongly inhibited the RANKL receptor (RANK) to nuclear factor of activated T cells c1 (NFATc1) signaling. Lentiviral expression of RANK in bone marrow-derived macrophages significantly restored osteoclastogenesis and NFATc1 amplification in Nec-7-treated cells. In this study, we revealed that Nec-7-sensitive pathways are crucially involved in osteoclast formation and function. Investigation of the molecular mechanism(s) through which Nec-7 inhibits RANK-NFATc1 signaling axis may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for bone disease. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Macrophage; Necrostatin-7; NFATc1; Osteoclast; RANK; RANKL,"apoptosis inhibitor; cathepsin K; colony stimulating factor 1; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; necrostatin 7; osteoclast differentiation factor; RANKL receptor; receptor; receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B; transcription factor NFAT; transcription factor NFATc1; unclassified drug; necrostatin-7; Nfatc1 protein, mouse; receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B; thiazole derivative; Tnfrsf11a protein, mouse; transcription factor NFAT; apoptosis; Article; bone marrow derived macrophage; cell differentiation; cell function; cell survival; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; human; human cell; osteoclast; osteoclastogenesis; osteolysis; priority journal; signal transduction; stem cell; animal; C57BL mouse; cell culture; cell differentiation; cytology; drug effect; drug therapy; female; macrophage; metabolism; osteoclast; signal transduction; Animals; Bone Resorption; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Female; Macrophages; Mice, Inbred C57BL; NFATC Transcription Factors; Osteoclasts; Receptor Activator of Nuclear Factor-kappa B; Signal Transduction; Thiazoles",2-s2.0-85049562041

Only few studies have revealed the relationship between vitamin D and its associated factors in Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. This study aimed to investigate the effects of MAC infection on serum vitamin D, human cationic antimicrobial protein 18, its C-terminal 37 amino acid fragment (hCAP18/LL-37) levels, and bone mineral density (BMD). We enrolled 58 patients with MAC lung disease and 15 control participants. Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and hCAP18/LL-37 levels were measured via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Lastly, computed tomography scan density readings of the BMD of the thoracic and lumbar vertebral bones (Th4, Th7, Th10, and L1) were assessed. No significant differences in patient characteristics and serum vitamin D levels were observed. Patients with MAC lung disease had significantly low serum hCAP18/LL-37 levels (P = .049). Moreover, low BMD of the mean thoracic and lumbar vertebrae was observed (mean Th, P = .012; L1, P = .48, respectively). A higher prevalence of scoliosis (P = .031) was observed in the participants with low BMD compared with the control participants. Based on a multivariate analysis, patients with MAC lung disease had significantly lower body mass index [odds ratio (OR), 19.1; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.0-419.0; P < .01] and vertebral BMD (OR, 12.4; 95% CI, 1.7-160.6; P = .012) than control participants. Serum hCAP18/LL-37 level and BMD were significantly decreased in patients with MAC lung disease without relation to serum vitamin D level. The vitamin D-independent pathway might affect the waning of antimicrobial peptides and decrease in BMD. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We sought to replicate the associations of 61 GWAS-identified SNPs at 42 loci with pancreatic cancer in Japanese and to develop a risk model for the identification of individuals at high risk for pancreatic cancer development in the general Japanese population. The model was based on data including directly determined or imputed SNP genotypes for 664 pancreatic cancer case and 664 age- and sex-matched control subjects. Stepwise logistic regression uncovered five GWAS-identified SNPs at five loci that also showed significant associations in our case-control cohort. These five SNPs were included in the risk model and also applied to calculation of the polygenic risk score (PRS). The area under the curve determined with the leave-one-out cross-validation method was 0.63 (95% confidence interval, 0.60–0.66) or 0.61 (0.58–0.64) for versions of the model that did or did not include cigarette smoking and family history of pancreatic cancer in addition to the five SNPs, respectively. Individuals in the lowest and highest quintiles for the PRS had odds ratios of 0.62 (0.42–0.91) and 1.98 (1.42–2.76), respectively, for pancreatic cancer development compared with those in the middle quintile. We have thus developed a risk model for pancreatic cancer that showed moderately good discriminatory ability with regard to differentiation of pancreatic cancer patients from control individuals. Our findings suggest the potential utility of a risk model that incorporates replicated GWAS-identified SNPs and established demographic or environmental factors for the identification of individuals at increased risk for pancreatic cancer development. ? 2018 Nakatochi et al.

Patients and Methods: We retrospectively screened 118 advanced NS-NSCLC patients who were treated with pemetrexed plus platinum derivatives alone (Bev(-)) or with bevacizumab (Bev(+)), and investigated the relationship between expression of TTF-1 and treatment outcomes. Results: Among the 92 TTF-1-positive patients, clinical outcomes in the Bev(+) group were significantly better than those in the Bev(-) group (response rate, 51.4% vs. 27.3%, p=0.027; median progression-free survival, 216 days vs. 137 days, p=0.012). Overall survival in the Bev(+) group tended to be longer than that in the Bev(-) group. However, the addition of bevacizumab to the standard treatment of 26 TTF-1-negative patients offered no clinical benefit.

We previously reported that the Ca2+-activated Cl? channel anoctamine (ANO)1 regulated human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) transcription in breast cancer YMB-1 cells. However, the mechanisms underlying ANO1-regulated HER2 gene expression have not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we showed the involvement of intracellular organelle ClC-3 Cl?/H+ transporter in HER2 transcription in breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells. The siRNA-mediated inhibition of ClC-3, but not ANO1, markedly repressed HER2 transcription in MDA-MB-453 cells. Subsequently, treatments with the AKT inhibitor AZD 5363 and mTOR inhibitor everolimus significantly enhanced HER2 transcription in MDA-MB-453 cells, whereas that with the STAT3 inhibitor 5,15-diphenylporphyrin (5,15-DPP) inhibited it. AKT and mTOR inhibitors also significantly enhanced HER2 transcription in YMB-1 cells. The siRNA-mediated inhibition of ClC-3 and ANO1 resulted in increased AKT phosphorylation and decreased STAT3 phosphorylation in MDA-MB-453 and YMB-1 cells, respectively. The intracellular Cl? channel protein CLIC1 was expressed in both cells; however, its siRNA-mediated inhibition did not elicit the transcriptional repression of HER2. Collectively, our results demonstrate that intracellular Cl? regulation by ANO1/ClC-3 participates in HER2 transcription, mediating the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and/or STAT3 signaling pathway(s) in HER2-positive breast cancer cells, and support the potential of ANO1/ClC-3 blockers as therapeutic options for patients with resistance to anti-HER2 therapies. ? 2018 The Authors.

Here we identify the novel homozygous mutation located in the SH3 binding motif of STAMBP (NM_006463.4) (c.707C>T: p.Ser236Phe) through whole-exome sequencing. The case patient was a 2-year-old boy showing severe global developmental delay, progressive microcephaly, refractory seizures, dysmorphic facial features, and multiple capillary malformations. Immunoblot analysis of patient-derived lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) revealed a severe reduction in STAMBP expression, indicating that Ser236Phe induces protein instability. STAMBP interacts with the SH3 domain of STAM and transduces downstream signals from the Jaks-STAM complex. The substitution of Ser236Phe found in the case patient was located in the SH3-binding motif, and we propose the mutation may block STAM binding and subsequently induce STAMBP degradation. Contrary to previously reported STAMBP mutations, the Ser236Phe mutation did not lead to constitutive activation of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway in patient-derived LCLs, as indicated by the expression of phosphorylated S6 ribosomal protein, suggesting that it is not the major pathomechanism underlying the disorder in this patient. ? 2018, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Japan Society of Human Genetics.",,"Janus kinase; mammalian target of rapamycin; phenylalanine; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; protein kinase B; protein S6; protein SH3; serine; ESCRT protein; STAMBP protein, human; ubiquitin thiolesterase; Akt signaling; Article; brain malformation; case report; child; clinical article; controlled study; developmental delay; disease severity; face dysmorphia; gene; gene expression; gene frequency; heterozygosity; homozygosity; human; human cell; immunoblotting; intractable epilepsy; lymphoblastoid cell line; male; microcephaly; microcephaly capillary malformation syndrome; missense mutation; mutational analysis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; preschool child; protein degradation; protein domain; protein expression; protein protein interaction; protein stability; Sanger sequencing; seizure; signal transduction; STAMBP gene; whole exome sequencing; genetics; homozygote; metabolism; microcephaly; pathology; protein motif; signal transduction; Src homology domain; syndrome; Amino Acid Motifs; Child, Preschool; Endosomal Sorting Complexes Required for Transport; Homozygote; Humans; Male; Microcephaly; Mutation, Missense; Signal Transduction; src Homology Domains; Syndrome; Ubiquitin Thiolesterase",2-s2.0-85048539549

This study aimed to investigate whether maternal exercise training protects the offspring from endotoxin-induced septic shock in mice. Female C57BL/6 mice performed voluntary wheel exercises during pregnancy. All dams and offspring were fed normal chow with sedentary activity during lactation and after weaning. At 10-week-old, mice were intraperitoneally injected a lethal (30 mg/kg) or nonlethal (15 mg/kg) dose of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), following which the survival of mice that were administered a lethal dose was monitored for 60 h. Plasma, lung, and liver samples were collected 18 h after the injection to evaluate the cytokine concentration or mRNA expression from those administered a nonlethal dose. Although maternal exercise training could not prevent lethality during an LPS-induced septic shock, it significantly inhibited the LPS-induced loss of body weight in female offspring. Regular maternal exercise significantly inhibited the mRNA expression of the LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), in the plasma and liver. Thus, maternal exercise inhibited the LPS-induced inflammatory response in female offspring, suggesting that regular exercise during pregnancy could be a potential candidate of the onset of sepsis and MODS in offspring. ? 2018 The Authors",Inflammatory response; LPS-induced sepsis; Maternal exercise; Offspring,bacterium lipopolysaccharide; cytokine; endotoxin; gamma interferon; interleukin 1beta; messenger RNA; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood sampling; body weight loss; C57BL 6 mouse; controlled study; exercise; female; food intake; gene expression; inflammation; lactation; lethality; liver tissue; lung parenchyma; male; maternal care; mouse; multiple organ failure; nonhuman; progeny; sedentary lifestyle; sepsis; septic shock; therapy effect,2-s2.0-85048445334

Introduction: In the phase III JCOG0301 trial, chemoradiotherapy (CRT) with daily low-dose carboplatin showed significant benefits in elderly patients with locally advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) compared with radiotherapy (RT) alone. However, the long-term patterns and cumulative incidences of toxicity associated with CRT and RT in elderly patients are not well elucidated. We report long-term survival data and late toxicities after a minimum follow-up of 6.4 years. Patients and Methods: Eligible patients were older than 70 years and had unresectable stage III NSCLC. They were randomly assigned to RT or CRT. Prognosis and adverse events data were collected beyond those in the initial report. Late toxicities were defined as occurring more than 90 days after RT initiation. Results: From September 2003 to May 2010, 200 patients (RT arm, n = 100; CRT arm, n = 100) were enrolled. Consistent with the initial report, the CRT arm had better overall survival than the RT arm (hazard ratio, 0.743; 95% confidence interval, 0.552-0.998; 1-sided P =.0239). The proportion of Grade 3/4 late toxicities were 7.4% (heart 2.1%, lung 5.3%) in the RT arm (n = 94) and 7.5% (esophagus 1.1%, lung 6.5%) in the CRT arm (n = 93). No additional cases of late toxicity (Grade 3/4) and treatment-related death have been seen since the initial report that was published. Conclusion: Long-term follow-up confirmed the survival benefits of CRT for elderly patients with locally advanced NSCLC. There was no observed increase in late toxicity with CRT compared with RT alone. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Carboplatin; Late radiation toxicity; Pneumonitis; Stage III; Treatment related death,"carboplatin; aged; Article; cancer growth; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cause of death; chemoradiotherapy; controlled study; dementia; diseases; female; follow up; forced expiratory volume; human; liver cell carcinoma; long term survival; low drug dose; lung cancer; lung toxicity; major clinical study; male; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; phase 3 clinical trial (topic); pneumonia; prostate cancer; randomized controlled trial; respiratory failure; smoking; subdural hematoma; adenocarcinoma; chemoradiotherapy; clinical trial; large cell carcinoma; lung tumor; mortality; multicenter study; non small cell lung cancer; pathology; phase 3 clinical trial; prognosis; squamous cell carcinoma; survival rate; very elderly; Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Large Cell; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Chemoradiotherapy; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Prognosis; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85048093817

They are also implicated as a cause of macrocephaly and mild to severe developmental delay, regardless of the presence or absence of hamartomas in childhood. Nevertheless, because of limited information, the clinical features present during childhood in patients with a PTEN mutation are yet to be elucidated. Methods: PTEN mutations were investigated by multiplex targeted sequencing of genomic DNA from 33 children with increased head circumference (>+2 SD) and developmental delay. The clinical features of all the patients with a PTEN mutation were abstracted by dysmorphologists. Results: We have identified six children with a PTEN mutation. Clinical dissection of these six patients, in addition to patient reports in the literature, revealed distinctive facial features that included frontal bossing, dolichocephaly, horizontal eyebrows, and a depressed nasal bridge. Macrocephaly (+3.2 to +6.0 SD) was noticeable compared to their height (?0.8 to +2.1 SD), and the difference in the SD value of head circumference and height was more than 3 SD in all patients. Conclusion: The presence of distinctive facies, extreme macrocephaly with normal to mildly high stature, and developmental delay may be useful for identifying patients with a PTEN mutation in childhood. Early identification of patients with a PTEN mutation would help uncover the natural course of tumor development in this group of individuals who have a possible predisposition to cancer, and be important for the development of an optimal surveillance strategy. ? 2018 The Japanese Society of Child Neurology",Facial dysmorphism; Hamartoma; Intellectual disability; Tumor predisposition,"genomic DNA; growth hormone; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; PTEN protein, human; Article; body height; case report; child; clinical article; clinical feature; depressed nasal bridge; developmental delay; dolichocephaly; eyebrow; facies; female; frameshift mutation; frontal bossing; gene mutation; growth hormone deficiency; head circumference; hereditary tumor syndrome; heterozygote; human; macrocephaly; male; missense mutation; molecular diagnosis; multiplex targeted sequencing; muscle hypotonia; mutational analysis; neuroimaging; nonsense mutation; normal value; nose malformation; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; preschool child; pten hamartoma tumor syndrome; sequence analysis; short stature; skull malformation; speech delay; white matter lesion; abnormalities; Alexander disease; developmental disorder; diagnostic imaging; face; genetics; mutation; phenotype; Child; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Face; Female; Humans; Male; Megalencephaly; Mutation; Phenotype; PTEN Phosphohydrolase",2-s2.0-85046625760

To investigate the stress caused by GPS labor management system, we studied its physiological and psychological impacts of the use of management system in nursing home workers. In 10 healthy labors, ambulatory ECG with 3-axis accelerograms were recorded during working hours on 4 days with similar work schedules; GPS system was used on 2 days (GPS+) and not used on the other 2 days (GPS?). Anxiety was assessed by State-Trait Anxiety Inventory performed on the second days of GPS+ and GPS?. While the use of GPS labor management system caused no difference in physical activity or anxiety scores, it decreased heart rate and increased parasympathetic indices of heart rate variability during both acting and resting periods. While classical fight-or-flight type stress response is accompanied by sympathetic activation and parasympathetic withdrawal, inescapable stress situations cause a sustained alert response, which is accompanied by parasympathetic activation and bradycardia. The autonomic responses observed under GPS system may be consistent with those with the sustained alert response. ? 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Actigraphy; Autonomic nervous system; Global positioning system; Heart rate variability; Labor management; Stress,Chemical activation; Heart; Human resource management; Image processing; Patient monitoring; Stresses; Actigraphy; Autonomic nervous system; Autonomic response; Heart rate variability; Labor management; Management systems; Satellite navigation; Satellite navigation systems; Global positioning system,2-s2.0-85058566914

It is shown that regular exercise can reduce PTSD symptoms, while no study has investigated the association between exercise and cognition in PTSD patients. This study aimed to examine cognitive functions of Japanese women with PTSD, and to explore the association between regular exercise and cognitive functions. Methods: Forty-two women with DSM-IV PTSD and 66 demographically matched healthy control women participated in this study. Most of the patients developed PTSD after experiencing interpersonal violence. Cognitive functions were assessed by the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Regular exercise habit was assessed by a self-reported questionnaire. Results: Compared to controls, PTSD patients performed significantly more poorly in all cognitive domains examined, including immediate memory, visuospatial construction, language, attention, delayed memory, as well as the total score of RBANS (all p < 0.001). Compared to PTSD patients without the habit of exercise, those who habitually exercised showed significantly better performance on delayed memory (p = 0.006), which survived after controlling for potentially confounding variables in a multiple regression model. Limitations: The cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size limited our findings. Conclusions: PTSD in Japanese women is associated with pervasively impaired cognitive functions, including notable impairments in verbal memory. Such memory deficits might be improved by regular exercise, although further studies are needed to investigate the causal relationship between exercise and cognition in PTSD. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cognitive function; Exercise; Memory; Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); Women,"adult; Article; attention; clinical article; cognitive defect; confounding variable; controlled study; cross-sectional study; DSM-IV; exercise; female; human; Japanese (people); language; posttraumatic stress disorder; priority journal; short term memory; violence; cognition; exercise; habit; Japan; memory disorder; middle aged; neuropsychological test; pathophysiology; posttraumatic stress disorder; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Attention; Cognition; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Habits; Humans; Japan; Memory Disorders; Memory, Short-Term; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85042439582

To investigate the tolerability of combination therapy with ERI and gemcitabine (GEM), we conducted a phase I clinical study in Japanese patients with metastatic breast cancer. The initial doses (Level 0) of ERI and GEM were 1.1 mg/m2 and 800mg/m2, respectively. When tolerability to Level 0 doses was confirmed, the doses were escalated to 1.4 mg/m2 for ERI and 800 mg/m2 for GEM (Level 1). Seven patients were enrolled in this study; 3 patients received Level 0 doses and the other 4 patients received Level 1 doses. A dose limiting toxicity (DLT) was found in only 1 patient of the Level 1 group (Grade 3 oral mucositis). However, Grade 3 or higher hematological toxicities, including neutropenia, frequently occurred, and hence, this combination therapy was not conducted as scheduled. Thus, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose (RD) for phase II trials were not evaluated in this study. Drug- drug interactions between ERI and GEM were not observed. In conclusion, it was difficult to continue the combination therapy for patients with advanced recurrent breast cancer due to hematological toxicities. There is little possibility for the combination therapy with ERI and GEM at the specific doses to be regarded as a new treatment option for Japanese patients. ?

However, the effects of the transplantation route and spheroid size on cell dynamics and the organ-specific accumulation of hepatocytes are not well characterized. In this study, the influence of three delivery routes (tail vein, portal vein, and spleen) and three spheroid sizes (50, 100, and 150 ?m in diameter) on the accumulation of human fetal hepatocytes labeled with quantum dots in the liver and other organs (heart, lung, kidney, and spleen) of recipient mice is investigated. Ex vivo fluorescence imaging reveals that the accumulation of transplanted cells in the liver is highest for transplantation via the portal vein compared with other routes. The accumulation efficiency depends on spheroid size, and spheroids with a diameter of 50 ?m display greater accumulation than that of spheroids of other sizes. It is concluded that hepatocyte transplantation via the portal vein using small spheroids of 50 ?m in diameter may be effective for clinical applications. ? 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Although surgical procedures such as soft tissue release and osteotomy have been advocated for its prevention, the exact indications of such procedures remain unclear. We attempted to evaluate preoperative radiographic parameters and identify prognostic factors in children with cerebral palsy. We retrospectively investigated 43 hips in 27 children with cerebral palsy who had undergone soft tissue release surgery for hip subluxation. We evaluated the age at the time of surgery and the radiographic parameters such as the center-edge angle (CEA), the migration percentage (MP), and the acetabular index (AI) at 3 time points: preoperation, 1 year after surgery, and at final follow-up. The outcome measure was determined by the MP value at final follow-up. Student t test was used to compare the quantitative variables between 2 groups (good vs poor outcome). Then the multiple regression analysis was applied to determine the prognostic factors upon soft tissue release surgery. Children with good outcome exhibited higher CEA (average value of 1.43° vs 13.2° in those with poor outcome), lower MP (53.9% vs 71.3%), and lower AI (28.1° vs 35.3°). Upon multiple regression analysis, we found that the age at the time of surgery, preoperative CEA, and preoperative MP did not appear to be independent prognostic factors. The only independent factor that affected prognosis after soft tissue release surgery was the preoperative AI. The preoperative AI values <34° were associated with the good outcome with specificity of 87% and sensitivity of 60% according to the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. These findings indicate that the outcome of soft tissue release surgery can be predicted by the preoperative AI value. Copyright ? 2018 the Author(s).

CMiPS cells were induced into the hindgut; then, the cells were seeded on microfabricated culture vessel plates to form spheroids. The resulting floating spheroids were differentiated into intestinal organoids in a medium containing small-molecule compounds. The mRNA expression of intestinal markers and pharmacokinetic-related genes was markedly increased in the presence of small-molecule compounds. The organoids possessed a polarized epithelium and contained various cells constituting small intestinal tissues. The intestinal organoids formed functional tight junctions and expressed drug transporter proteins. In addition, in the organoids generated, cytochrome P450 3A8 (CYP3A8) activity was inhibited by the specific inhibitor ketoconazole and was induced by rifampicin.

This study investigated possible associations between electrocardiogram (ECG) findings relevant to the QRS wave and high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) in the general population. Subjects undergoing their annual health checkup were enrolled in the study (n = 1258). ECG features relevant to the QRS wave that were investigated included PQ interval, QRS voltage (Sokolow–Lyon voltage), QRS duration, product of QRS duration and voltage (Cornell product), corrected QT interval, and QRS axis. Laboratory measurements included hs-cTnI and B-type natriuretic peptide. hs-cTnI was significantly higher in subjects with a long PQ interval, high Sokolow–Lyon voltage, wide QRS duration, increased Cornell product, long corrected QT interval, or left QRS axis deviation. Univariate and multivariate regression analysis showed that Sokolow–Lyon voltage, QRS duration, and Cornell product were significantly associated with hs-cTnI after adjustment for possible confounding factors, including B-type natriuretic peptide. Logistic regression analysis with the endpoint of higher hs-cTnI than the median value showed that Sokolow–Lyon voltage and Cornell product were independently associated with increased hs-cTnI concentrations.

Cryptorchidism cannot be diagnosed before birth and is not a factor that would influence a woman's decision to seek an abortion. Therefore, this disease is considered suitable for assessing how the Great East Japan Earthquake and the subsequent Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident (2011) influenced congenital diseases. Materials and Methods: We obtained cryptorchidism discharge data collected over 6 years from hospitals that were included in an impact assessment survey of the Diagnosis Procedure Combination survey database in Japan and used these data to estimate the discharge rate after cryptorchidism surgery before and after the disaster. The 94 hospitals in Japan that participated in Diagnosis Procedure Combination system and had 10 or more discharges after cryptorchidism surgery within successive 6 years covering pre- and postdisaster period (FY2010-FY2015) were involved. The change in discharge rate between pre- and postdisaster was analyzed using a Bayesian generalized linear mixed model. Results: Nationwide, a 13.4% (95% credible interval 4.7%-23.0%) increase in discharge rates was estimated. The results of all sensitivity analyses were similar to the reported main results. Conclusion: The discharge rate of cryptorchidism was increased nationwide. The rates of low-weight babies or preterm births, risk factors of cryptorchidism, were almost constant during the study period, and age distribution of the surgery was also not changed, which suggested that the other factors that associated with the disaster increased the incidence of cryptorchidism. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,"Article; Bayes theorem; cryptorchism; disaster; Fukushima nuclear accident; health impact assessment; health survey; hospital discharge; human; incidence; Japan; male; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; adult; cryptorchism; disaster; earthquake; female; low birth weight; mental stress; newborn; pathophysiology; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prematurity; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Cryptorchidism; Disasters; Earthquakes; Female; Fukushima Nuclear Accident; Humans; Incidence; Infant, Low Birth Weight; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Male; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Premature Birth; Risk Factors; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-85047653426

Because patients with tinnitus frequently have psychological problems, self-reporting of the severity of tinnitus is unreliable. We developed a new grading system and practical protocol for the systematic treatment of tinnitus that accounts for its severity, patients’ psychological problems, and the frequency of catastrophic episodes. The aim of this study is to employ and validate the new system in patients with tinnitus. Methods: This study comprised two parts: (i) We identified 113 patients, who were then analyzed in terms of severity of tinnitus, psychological problems, and catastrophic episodes. They were then classified into 5 grades, and the records of their previous treatments were scrutinized. From these records, we designed a practical treatment protocol suitable for each of the 5 grades. (ii) We then identified 82 new patients, and graded and treated them according to the system developed in part (i). Patients were followed-up for at least 6 months; treatment efficacy was evaluated using the pre- and post-treatment scores on the Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Psychological status was also assessed with the DSM-IV. Results: (i) The overall patient group was categorized as follows: Grade I, 38 patients, average THI = 37.6 points, average HADS = 10.9 points, catastrophic episodes = 0 points; Grade II, 24 patients, THI = 70.6, HADS = 13.1, catastrophic episodes = 0; Grade III, 5 patients, THI = 73.2, HADS = 28.4, catastrophic episodes = 0; Grade IV, 33 patients, THI = 63.5, HADS = 18.8, catastrophic episodes = 1.0; Grade V, 13 patients, THI = 73.2, HADS = 22.4, catastrophic episodes = 2.2. The treatment records revealed treatment via psychotropic drugs for 40% of Grade III, 45.5% of Grade IV, and 84.6% of Grade V patients; psychiatric consultation was provided for 20% of Grade III, 12.5% of Grade IV, and 53.8% of Grade V patients. (ii) THI scores improved significantly in Grades II, IV, and V after treatment using the new protocol; HADS scores improved significantly in Grades IV and V. Catastrophic episode scores improved significantly in Grades IV and V. Conclusion: We found large enough differences in THI and HADS scores to successfully classify patients with tinnitus into 5 distinct grades that accounted for tinnitus severity, psychological problems, and catastrophic episodes. We found significant improvements in tinnitus severity and psychological problems in the higher (more severe) grades when this system was used to guide treatment.

We evaluated the incidence of hypercalcemia following combined calcipotriol hydrate/betamethasone dipropionate ointment in patients with severe psoriasis vulgaris. Methods: Japanese patients (n = 22) with extensive plaque psoriasis (body surface area: 20–30%) applied the combined calcipotriol hydrate/betamethasone dipropionate ointment once daily for 8 weeks, and their serum Ca concentrations were measured periodically. Results: The mean serum Ca concentration changed only marginally, from 9.04 ± 0.34 mg/dL before treatment to 9.08 ± 0.39 mg/dL after 8 weeks of treatment. None of the patients had an elevated serum Ca concentration throughout the study. No cases of hypercalcemia were reported as an adverse event.

Tofacitinib is a novel oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor and is effective in treating RA. However, the mechanism of action of tofacitinib in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) has not been elucidated. The purpose of this study was to investigate the modulatory effects of tofacitinib on serum GLS levels in patients with RA and GLS production in FLSs derived from patients with RA.METHODS: Six patients with RA who had failed therapy with at least one TNF inhibitor and were receiving tofacitinib therapy were included in the study. Serum samples were collected to measure CRP, MMP-3 and GLS expression. FLSs derived from patients with RA were cultured and stimulated by TNFα with or without tofacitinib. GLS expression levels were determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), EIA and immunocytochemistry, and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) protein phosphorylation levels were determined by western blotting.RESULTS: Treatment with tofacitinib decreased serum GLS levels in all patients. GLS mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly increased by treatment with TNF-α alone, and these increases were suppressed by treatment with tofacitinib, which also inhibited TNF-α-induced STAT1 phosphorylation.CONCLUSIONS: JAK/STAT activation plays a pivotal role in TNF-α-mediated GLS up-regulation in RA. Suppression of GLS expression in FLSs has been suggested to be one of the mechanisms through which tofacitinib exerts its anti-inflammatory effects.",,"Janus kinase inhibitor; piperidine derivative; pyrimidine derivative; pyrrole derivative; STAT1 protein; STAT1 protein, human; thymidine phosphorylase; tofacitinib; tumor necrosis factor; TYMP protein, human; aged; antagonists and inhibitors; female; fibroblast; genetics; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; rheumatoid arthritis; synoviocyte; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Female; Fibroblasts; Humans; Janus Kinase Inhibitors; Male; Middle Aged; Piperidines; Pyrimidines; Pyrroles; STAT1 Transcription Factor; Synoviocytes; Thymidine Phosphorylase; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",2-s2.0-85053548377

Adjusting for socioeconomic factors, multiple logistic regression identified that respondents who received instrumental support were less likely to experience unmet health care needs except males aged 65 to 69 years. The effect of receiving instrumental social support was larger than for household income and similar to anxiety about unexpected expenses. In the low-income group, these findings were highlighted among females aged 65 to 69 years and males aged 70 years and older.

Although prior studies have examined the effects of traditional media on children’s development, there is limited evidence on the impact of mobile device use. The current study aimed to clarify the link between mobile device use and child adjustment. The sample included 1,642 children aged 6 in first grade at elementary schools in Japan. Parents completed a self-report questionnaire regarding their children’s use of mobile devices and emotional/behavioral adjustment. We performed inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) logistic regression to compute odds ratios (OR) for emotional/behavioral problems according to mobile device use. The values for IPTW analysis were computed based on variables assessing sociodemographics and child characteristics. Among the participants, 230 (14.0%) were regular users (60 minutes or more on a typical day) and 1,412 (86.0%) non-regular users (under 60 minutes on a typical day). Relative to non-regular use, regular use of mobile devices was significantly linked to conduct problems (IPTW-OR: 1.77, 95% CI: [1.03–3.04], p < .05) and hyperactivity/inattention (IPTW-OR: 1.82, 95% CI: [1.15–2.87], p < .01).

Next, based on a GWAS statistics obtained by a previous study with human AD subjects, we obtained gene-based statistics from the SNP-based statistics. We combined p values from the two types of analysis across orthologous gene pairs in human and mouse into one p value for each gene to evaluate AD susceptibility. As a result, we found five genes with significant p values in this integrated analysis among the 373 genes analyzed. We also examined the gene expression level of these five genes in the hippocampus of independent human AD cases and control subjects. Two genes, LBH and SHF, showed lower expression levels in AD cases than control subjects. This is consistent with the gene expression levels of both the genes in mouse which were negatively correlated with Aβ accumulation. These results, obtained from the integrative approach, suggest that LBH and SHF are associated with the AD pathogenesis. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"ADORA1 protein; ALG14 protein; amyloid beta protein; APPBP2 protein; ARRB1 protein; arylsulfatase family member j; C5orf51 protein; CNIH4 protein; CP110 protein; CSRNP1 protein; CSRNP3 protein; EBNA1BP2 protein; EML4 protein; GRIK4 protein; HLA DMA protein; HPS6 protein; KCNS1 protein; limb bud and heart development protein; PHGDH protein; protein; protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 2; PTPRD protein; RSRC1 protein; sialyltransferase; SLC8A1 protein; src homology 2 domain containing f; st6 n acetylgalactosaminide alpha 2,6 sialyltransferase 4; TNNT1 protein; transcriptome; unclassified drug; ZNF585A protein; amyloid beta protein; Lbh protein, mouse; nuclear protein; signal peptide; transcriptome; Alzheimer disease; anterior cingulate; Article; autopsy; controlled study; expression quantitative trait locus; female; frontal cortex; gene expression; gene expression level; genetic association; genetic background; genetic susceptibility; genome-wide association study; hippocampus; human; human tissue; male; mouse; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; Alzheimer disease; animal; biosynthesis; disease model; gene expression regulation; genetics; genome-wide association study; metabolism; single nucleotide polymorphism; transgenic mouse; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Gene Expression Regulation; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Nuclear Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Transcriptome",2-s2.0-85049853309

Since deregulation of microRNA (miRNA) expression by HBV infection contributes to enhanced viral replication and pathogenesis, modulation of miRNA activity can be a novel therapeutic approach towards HBV eradication. As the effects of the vast majority of miRNAs on HBV replication have not been empirically investigated, here, we aim to identify novel therapeutic targets that have a strong antiviral effect on HBV. Methods: HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells were infected with HBV, and then were individually transfected with the library mimics of 2048 miRNAs. To assess the amount of intracellular and extracellular DNA and HBsAg, qPCR and ELISA were performed respectively. Results: From miRNA library screening, we identified 39 miRNAs as candidate repressors of HBV replication. Among them, 9 miRNAs, including miR-204, strongly decreased both HBV DNA and HBsAg in culture supernatant of HepG2-hNTCP-C4 cells. Furthermore, we also showed that inhibition of Rab22a, one of the targets of miR-204, also suppressed intracellular and extracellular HBV DNA expression in HepG2.2.15.7 cells. Conclusions: Our findings contribute to the understanding of the roles of miRNAs underlying HBV replication and show the possibility of developing a novel strategy for miRNA-mediated HBV treatment. ?

We have previously shown that vaccine immunotherapy with Toll-like receptor (TLR)3-adjuvant and tumor antigen overcomes anti-programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) resistance in mouse tumor models. In the present study, 4 different ovalbumin (OVA)-expressing tumor cell lines were implanted into syngeneic mice and subjected to anti-tumor immunotherapy using ARNAX and whole OVA protein. ARNAX is a TLR3-specific agonist that does not activate the mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS) pathway, and thus does not induce systemic inflammation. Dendritic cell priming and proliferative CTL were induced by ARNAX + OVA, but complete remission was achieved only in a PD-L1-low cell line of EG7. Addition of anti-PD-L1 antibody to the ARNAX + OVA therapy brought complete remission to another PD-L1-high subline of EG7. Tumor shrinkage but not remission was observed in MO5 in that regimen. We analyzed tumor cells and tumor-infiltrating immune cells to identify factors associated with successful ARNAX vaccine therapy. Tumors that responded to ARNAX therapy expressed high levels of MHC class I and low levels of PD-L1. The tumor-infiltrating immune cells in ARNAX-susceptible tumors contained fewer immunosuppressive myeloid cells with low PD-L1 expression. Combination with anti-PD-L1 antibody functioned not only within tumor sites but also within lymphoid tissues, augmenting the therapeutic efficacy of the ARNAX vaccine. Notably, ARNAX therapy induced memory CD8+ T cells and rejection of reimplanted tumors. Thus, ARNAX vaccine + anti-PD-L1 therapy enabled permanent remission against some tumors that stably present antigens. ? 2018 The Authors.

Methods We surveyed clinical data from 1834 patients (1479 men and 355 women) at 125 hospitals. Results Extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL) was performed alone in 103 patients (5.6%), ESWL plus an endoscopic procedure in 446 (24.3%), endoscopic treatment alone in 261 (14.2%), and surgery in 167 (9.1%). Other treatments were given to 358 (19.5%), whereas 499 (27.2%) received no treatment. Symptoms were relieved in 85.7% after ESWL, 80.8% after endoscopic treatment alone, and 92.8% after surgery. Early complication rates within 3 months after ESWL, endoscopic treatment alone, and surgery were 8%, 4.5%, and 27.1%, respectively. Late complications after ESWL, endoscopic procedures alone, and surgery were 1.7%, 2.5%, and 8.2%, respectively. Symptom relief but also early and late complications were greater after surgery than after ESWL and endoscopic treatment. Among 417 patients undergoing ESWL, 61 (14.6%) required surgery, as did 32 (16%) of 200 patients treated endoscopically. Surgery was required less frequently following initial operative treatment (11/164 patients [6.7%]). Nonsurgical initial treatments were chosen more frequently. Conclusions First-line treatment of pancreatolithiasis should be ESWL with or without endoscopy because of minimal invasiveness and fewer complications. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",chronic pancreatitis; endoscopic pancreatic sphincterotomy; endoscopic removal of pancreatic stones; extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy; pancreatic ductal decompression surgery,"pancreas enzyme; proteinase inhibitor; spasmolytic agent; abdominal abscess; abdominal bleeding; abdominal pain; acute cholecystitis; acute pancreatitis; adult; aged; anastomosis leakage; aneurysm rupture; anorexia; artery rupture; balloon dilatation; bile duct fistula; bleeding disorder; child; cholangitis; clinical assessment; endoscopic sphincterotomy; extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy; female; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; health survey; human; ileus; intestine perforation; Japan; liver abscess; lobar pneumonia; lung infarction; major clinical study; male; managed care; obstructive jaundice; pancreas fistula; pancreas stone; pancreas surgery; pancreaticoduodenectomy; postoperative complication; priority journal; pseudocyst; pseudomembranous colitis; respiratory distress syndrome; Review; spleen disease; stomach ulcer; subcutaneous hemorrhage; surgical infection; symptom; treatment indication; very elderly; adolescent; Asian continental ancestry group; clinical trial; endoscopy; ethnology; lithotripsy; middle aged; multicenter study; multimodality cancer therapy; pancreas disease; procedures; statistics and numerical data; stone formation; treatment outcome; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Child; Combined Modality Therapy; Endoscopy; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Japan; Lithiasis; Lithotripsy; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Diseases; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85049033612

Materials and methods: Single-shot diffusion echo-planar imaging (SSD-EPI) with multiple b-values (0–3000 s/mm 2 ) was performed without fat suppression to separate water and lipid images using the chemical shift displacement of lipid signals in the phase-encoding direction. An inversion pulse (TI = 292 ms) was applied to SSD-EPI to remove olefinic signals. Consecutively, SSD-EPI (b = 0 s/mm 2 ) was performed with TI = 0 ms and TE = 31.8 ms for T 1 and T 2 measurements, respectively. Under these conditions, transverse water and lipid images at the maximum diameter of the right calf were obtained in six healthy subjects. T 1 , T 2 , and the apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were then calculated for the tibialis anterior (TA), gastrocnemius (GM), and soleus (SL) muscles, tibialis bone marrow (TB), and subcutaneous fat (SF). Perfusion-related (D*) and restricted diffusion coefficients (D) were calculated for the muscles. Lastly, the lipid fractions (LF) of the muscles were determined after T 1 and T 2 corrections. Results: The modified SPLIT method facilitated sufficient separation of water and lipid images of the calf, and the inversion pulse with TI of 292 ms effectively suppressed olefinic signals. All quantitative parameters obtained with the modified SPLIT method were found to be in general agreement with those previously reported in the literature. Conclusion: The modified SPLIT technique enabled sufficient suppression of olefinic signals and simultaneous acquisition of quantitative parameters including diffusion, perfusion, T 1 and T 2 relaxation times, and LF. ? 2018",Chemical shift; Diffusion-weighted imaging; Echo-planar imaging; Intravoxel incoherent motion; Lipid,"adult; Article; bone marrow; chemical shift displacement; controlled study; diffusion coefficient; female; gastrocnemius muscle; human; human experiment; image analysis; lipid imaging; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; perfusion; priority journal; quantitative analysis; radiological parameters; recovery-based separation of lipid tissue; relaxation time; single-shot diffusion echo-planar imaging; soleus muscle; subcutaneous fat; tibia; tibialis anterior muscle; water imaging; young adult; adipose tissue; anatomy and histology; body water; diagnostic imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; echo planar imaging; image processing; multimodal imaging; muscle; procedures; reference value; Adipose Tissue; Adult; Body Water; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Echo-Planar Imaging; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Multimodal Imaging; Muscles; Reference Values; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85044606396

Aim of the study: We evaluated the promotive effects of BTS on lipid and cholesterol elimination in mice. Materials and methods: Mice were reared with a high-fat diet containing boiled water extract of BTS for 30 days, and their biochemical parameters as well as the weight and lipid content of feces were measured. We also measured cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells cultured with or without BTS extract. Results: The body weight and amounts of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat on day 28; the weights of epididymal, perirenal, and mesenteric fat; and the serum concentrations of triglyceride, glucose, and hemoglobin A1c on day 30 were significantly lower in the BTS extract-treated groups than in the control in a dose-dependent manner. The amounts of lipid and cholesterol in the feces collected from day 6–23 were significantly greater than in the control. When Caco-2 cells were incubated with BTS extract, the uptake of cholesterol into cells was significantly reduced in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the components of BTS, the methanol extracts of Platycodi Radix and Zingiberis Rhizoma contribute but the extracts of Ephedrae Herba and Rhei Rhizoma counteract the suppressive effect of BTS on cholesterol uptake into Caco-2 cells. Conclusions: BTS has beneficial effects on obesity and metabolic syndrome, and its mechanisms of action include the promotion of lipid elimination and the inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the intestine. ? 2018 The Authors",Bofutsushosan; Cholesterol excretion; High fat diet; Lipid excretion; NPC1L1,"Angelica root; bofutsushosan; calcium sulfate; Chinese drug; cholesterol; Ephedrae Herba extract; ezetimibe; fangfengtongshengsan; glucose; glycyrrhizae radix; hemoglobin A1c; Kampo medicine (drug); lipid; natural product; plant extract; Platycodi Radix extract; radix paeoniae; rhubarb extract; Scutellariae radix; sitosterol; sodium sulfate; stigmasterol; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; Zingiberis Rhizoma extract; bofu-tsusho-san; cholesterol; herbaceous agent; animal experiment; animal model; Article; Atractylodis rhizoma; biochemical analysis; body weight; Caco-2 cell line; cancer cell culture; Chinese medicine; cholesterol transport; Cnidium; concentration response; controlled study; dose response; drug cytotoxicity; drug effect; drug isolation; Ephedrae herba; epididymis fat; excretion; experimental obesity; feces analysis; Forsythiae fructus; Gardeniae fructus; ginger; glucose blood level; hemoglobin blood level; human; human cell; intra-abdominal fat; Kampo medicine; Kasseki; lipid absorption; lipid analysis; lipid diet; male; Menthae herba; mesenteric fat; metabolic syndrome X; mouse; nonhuman; perirenal fat; Platycodi radix; Rhei rhizoma; Saposhnikoviae radix; Schizonepetae spica; single drug dose; subcutaneous fat; triacylglycerol blood level; white adipose tissue; animal; C57BL mouse; feces; lipid metabolism; metabolic syndrome X; metabolism; obesity; Animals; Body Weight; Caco-2 Cells; Cholesterol; Diet, High-Fat; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Feces; Humans; Intra-Abdominal Fat; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Obesity",2-s2.0-85044577081

However, the relationship between NVP and preterm births remains unknown. This study was conducted to evaluate the association between NVP and the risk of preterm births. Methods: The dataset of a birth cohort study, the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS), was retrospectively reviewed. Participants' experience of NVP prior to 12 gestational weeks were evaluated by a questionnaire administered from 22 weeks of pregnancy to 1 month before delivery. NVP responses were elicited against four choices based on which the study population was divided into four subcohorts. Preterm birth was the main study outcome. Logistic regression analysis was used to quantify an association between NVP and risk of preterm birth. Results: Of 96,056 women, 79,460 (82.7%) experienced some symptoms of NVP and 10,518 (10.9%) experienced severe NVP. Compared to those who did not experience NVP, women with severe NVP had lower odds for preterm birth [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 0.84, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.74-0.95]. An even lower OR was found among very preterm birth and extremely preterm birth (aOR 0.44, 95% CI 0.29-0.65). Conclusion: An inverse association exists between NVP and preterm births, especially, very preterm births and extremely preterm births. ? 2018 The Author(s).",JECS; Nausea and vomiting during pregnancy; Preterm birth,"adult; Article; child; childbirth; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; female; gestation period; human; hyperemesis gravidarum; incidence; Japan; major clinical study; middle aged; nausea and vomiting; obstetric delivery; population research; prematurity; questionnaire; retrospective study; risk assessment; symptom; young adult; complication; incidence; nausea; newborn; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; prematurity; procedures; vomiting; Adult; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant, Newborn; Japan; Nausea; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Premature Birth; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Vomiting",2-s2.0-85049134801

Patients with chronic MDD often have negative impacts on the health of their families. Family psychoeducation is recognized as part of the optimal treatment for patients with psychotic disorder, and has been shown to reduce the rate of relapse in individuals with schizophrenia and to reduce the burden on their caregivers. Thus, we predict that family psychoeducation has the potential to reduce the burden on the caregivers of patients with chronic MDD. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the effects of brief multifamily psychoeducation (BMP) on the mental health status of family members of patients with chronic MDD. Methods: We conducted a clinical trial consisting of 49 chronic MDD patients and their families. Each family was randomly assigned to either the BMP intervention group or the control group. The intervention group received four BMP sessions, once every two weeks for eight weeks. The control group received one counseling session administered by a nurse. All patients received standard treatment administered by physicians. The primary outcome measurement was the Kessler Screening Scale for Psychological Distress (K6) score of family members at 16- weeks after the first BMP session. Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms of both family members and patients at multiple time points, as well as family functioning as evaluated by the patients. Intention-to-treat analyses were conducted. Results: There was no statistically significant effect of BMP on K6 scores at 16- weeks (mean difference 1.17, 95% confidence interval: - 0.63 to 2.98, P = 0.19). Exploratory analyses revealed that BMP reduced depressive symptoms in family members at 8- weeks (difference = - 3.37, 95%CI -6.32 to - 0.43, P = 0.02) and improved family functioning at multiple time points (Role; 8 W, difference = - 0.13, 95%CI -0.26 to - 0.00, P = 0.04, Affective Responsiveness; 8 W, difference = - 0.24, 95%CI -0.43 to - 0.05, P = 0.01, 32 W, difference = - 0.22, 95%CI -0.41 to - 0.03, P = 0.02, Behavior Control; 16 W, difference = - 0.17, 95%CI -0.34 to - 0.00, P = 0.04).

NAC1 knock-down was previously shown to result in the apoptosis of ovarian cancer cell lines and to rescue their sensitivity to chemotherapy, suggesting that NAC1 may be a potential therapeutic target, but protein complex formation of intranuclear NAC1 in ovarian cancer cells remain poorly understood. In this study, analysis of ovarian cancer cell lysates by fast protein liquid chromatography on a sizing column showed that the NAC1 peak corresponded to an apparent molecular mass of 300-500 kDa, which is larger than the estimated molecular mass (58 kDa) of the protein. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis identified CARM1 as interacting with NAC1 in the protein complex. Furthermore, tissue microarray analysis revealed a significant correlation between CARM1 and NAC1 expression levels. Ovarian cancer patients expressing high levels of NAC1 and CARM1 exhibited poor prognosis after adjuvant chemotherapy. Collectively, our results demonstrate that high expression levels of NAC1 and its novel binding partner CARM1 may serve as an informative prognostic biomarker for predicting resistance to chemotherapy for ovarian cancer. ?Nakayama et al.",AOvarian cancer; Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1); Nucleus accumbens-associated protein 1 (NAC1); Protein arginine N-methyltransferase 4 (PRMT4),carboplatin; coactivator associated arginine methyltransferase 1; docetaxel; paclitaxel; platinum derivative; protein arginine methyltransferase; transcription factor; transcription factor NAC1; unclassified drug; adjuvant chemotherapy; adult; Article; cancer cell; cancer growth; controlled study; correlational study; female; human; human cell; human tissue; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; microarray analysis; middle aged; molecular weight; multiple cycle treatment; ovary cancer; protein expression; tissue microarray,2-s2.0-85048790978

Knowledge and behaviors which are related to rabies and/or dogs are considered to be contributing factors for rabies infection control in the community; however, such information in rural Cambodia is limited. This cross-sectional study aimed to assess knowledge and experiences related to rabies as well as dog-related behaviors among people in Siem Reap Province, and to identify the specific factors associated with adequate knowledge. Methods: Four-stage sampling was employed to identify villages and households. In total, 360 respondents were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Data were descriptively summarized and logistic regression was performed to estimate odds ratios of adequate knowledge related to rabies for respondents' characteristics. Results: Only 9.7% of respondents had adequate knowledge of rabies. Of the respondents, 86.9 and 18.3% had experienced hearing of or seeing a suspected rabid dog and a suspected rabid human, respectively. More than two-thirds (70.6%) of households had at least one dog, and the ratio of dog to human populations was 1: 2.8. Only a few owners had vaccinated dogs, used a cage, or tied up their dog. Visiting a health center was the first choice of treatment for respondents when bitten by a dog. However, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was not commonly expected as a treatment choice by respondents. Those with higher education were more likely to have adequate knowledge than those with no education (adjusted OR 12.34, 95% CI 2.64-57.99, p < 0.01). Farmers and non-poor families were also less likely to have adequate knowledge than those of other professions and poor families (adjusted OR 0.30, 95% CI 0.12-0.76, p = 0.01, and adjusted OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.47, p < 0.01, respectively). Conclusions: High dog population, inadequate knowledge of rabies, low recognition of human rabies, and poor dog management were found to be serious challenges for controlling rabies. Health education related to rabies should be introduced, targeting farmers in particular who easily encounter stray dogs but have little knowledge of rabies risk factors and signs. At the same time, PEP delivery and dog management should be improved. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Behaviors; Cambodia; Knowledge; Post-exposure prophylaxis; Rabies; Rural population,antibiotic agent; rabies vaccine; tetanus toxoid; adult; agricultural worker; Article; Cambodia; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; dog bite; economic aspect; educational status; experience; family income; female; household; human; knowledge; male; post exposure prophylaxis; rabies; structured questionnaire; vaccination,2-s2.0-85048295975

Laminins are important components of the basement membrane (BM) and impact on epidermal keratinocyte growth/apoptosis. Although several laminins are involved in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, it is still controversial about the expression patterns of laminin isoforms and which laminins are important in the development of psoriasis. Because laminin-511 and -332 are key BM components in human skin, and laminin-511 stimulates human hair follicle growth, we asked whether the BM zone in psoriasis shows any laminin-related abnormalities. This showed that the BM expression of laminin-511 and -332 was significantly increased within the skin lesion of psoriasis. Immunofluorescence microscopy revealed that laminin-511, -332, and collagen type IV proteins were also significantly increased in psoriasis-like skin lesions of Imiquimod-treated mice. Transmission electron microscopy showed a few gaps of lamina densa, and its thickness was significantly increased. Finally, laminin-511 treatment significantly stimulated the proliferation and inhibited apoptosis of HaCaT cells, while laminin-α5 chain gene knockdown decreased proliferation and induced apoptosis. These phenomenological observations raise the question of whether laminin-511-controlled keratinocyte growth/death may be a previously overlooked player in the pathogenesis of psoriatic epidermal lesions. ?

The non-electrical components modify the function of neural circuits, depending on the electrical neuronal activity, by wrapping synapses, myelinating axons and phagocytozing the neuronal components. Moreover, recent evidence has suggested that they contribute to neurological and psychiatric disease by regulating neuronal circuits, ultimately affecting their behaviour. In this review, we highlight the physiological functions of glial cells, particularly the electrical activity-dependent processes, to provide further insight into their role in brain function. ?

Primary outcomes were changes in self-reported confidence, knowledge and attitudes toward caring for patients with normal psychological response between pre-training and posttraining. All outcomes, excepting several aspects of attitude, were significantly improved after training (P < 0.05). Intervention acceptability was good as no participants dropped out and all participants considered the program useful in clinical practice.

Recent advances in genome-wide-association studies (GWAS) revealed several genetic loci associated with renal function traits worldwide. Methods: We investigated the association of genetic factors with the levels of serum creatinine (SCr) and the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in Japanese population-based cohorts analyzing the GWAS imputed data with 11,221 subjects and 12,617,569 variants, and replicated the findings with the 148,829 hospital-based Japanese subjects. Results: In the discovery phase, 28 variants within 4 loci (chromosome [chr] 2 with 8 variants including rs3770636 in the LDL receptor related protein 2 gene locus, on chr 5 with 2 variants including rs270184, chr 17 with 15 variants including rs3785837 in the BCAS3 gene locus, and chr 18 with 3 variants including rs74183647 in the nuclear factor of -activated T-cells 1 gene locus) reached the suggestive level of p &lt; 1 × 10-6 in association with eGFR and SCr, and 2 variants on chr 4 (including rs78351985 in the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein gene locus) fulfilled the suggestive level in association with the risk of CKD. In the replication phase, 25 variants within 3 loci (chr 2 with 7 variants, chr 17 with 15 variants and chr 18 with 3 variants) in association with eGFR and SCr, and 2 variants on chr 4 associated with the risk of CKD became nominally statistically significant after Bonferroni correction, among which 15 variants on chr 17 and 3 variants on chr 18 reached genome-wide significance of p &lt; 5 × 10-8 in the combined study meta-analysis. The associations of the loci on chr 2 and 18 with eGFR and SCr as well as that on chr 4 with CKD risk have not been previously reported in the Japanese and East Asian populations. Conclusion: Although the present GWAS of renal function traits included the largest sample of Japanese participants to date, we did not identify novel loci for renal traits. However, we identified the novel associations of the genetic loci on chr 2, 4, and 18 with renal function traits in the Japanese population, suggesting these are transethnic loci. Further investigations of these associations are expected to further validate our findings for the potential establishment of personalized prevention of renal disease in the Japanese and East Asian populations. ? 2018 S.

The present study investigated whether HSP90, a high-molecular-weight HSP, was implicated in the ET-1-stimulated HSP27 induction in MC3T3-E1 cells. The effects of HSP90 inhibitors on the induction of HSP27 were examined. The HSP90 inhibitors geldanamycin and 17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-DMAG) significantly amplified HSP27 induction stimulated by ET-1 in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, onalespib (another HSP90 inhibitor) significantly strengthened the ET-1-induced HSP27 protein levels. The ET-1-stimulated phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was minimally affected by geldanamycin, 17-DMAG or onalespib. Onalespib and 17-DMAG significantly enhanced the ET-1-induced phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK. In addition, SP600125, a SAPK/JNK inhibitor, notably reduced the amplification by onalespib of ET-1-induced HSP27. These results suggest that HSP90 limits ET-1-stimulated HSP27 induction at a point upstream of SAPK/JNK in osteoblasts. These results suggest that HSP90 may be a novel clinical target for metabolic bone diseases, including osteoporosis. ? 2018 Spandidos Publications.

To develop a more effective and less toxic combination of immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) for therapy, the antitumor effect of sub-optimal doses of AFU, pomalidomide plus dexamethasone (PD), and the AFU-PD combination on MM cells were examined in the present study. Two MM cell lines, XG?7 and U266, with low sensitivity to both PD and AFU monotherapies, were subjected to these combinations and analyzed. Although the cell lines showed a slight reduction in viability with the sub?optimal doses of each monotherapy, the combination of the treatments resulted in a reduction in cell viability and the progression of apoptosis. Co-treatment with sub-optimal doses of PD and AFU enhanced caspase activation and highly suppressed the expression of IKZF1 and IKZF3. In addition, this combination promoted the dephosphorylation and stabilization of 4EBP1, an inhibitor of eIF4E activation, which led to the impairment of eIF4E-mediated translational activity. Furthermore, AFU showed a sufficient inhibitory effect on the phosphorylation of FOXO1, a tumor suppressor, in monotherapy or in combination with PD, which may be attributable to the activation of FOXO1, the subsequent inhibition of tumor growth, and the induction of cell death. In conclusion, the combination therapy with sub-optimal doses of PD and AFU exhibited potent antitumor activity in MM cells and may provide a novel strategy for the treatment of patients who experienced intolerable toxicity or insufficient response during IMiD therapy. ? 2018, Spandidos Publications.

This case demonstrated that the color Doppler and probe compression technique is useful for detecting a fibrin sheath. ? 2018 The Authors",Fibrin sheath; Peripherally inserted central catheter; Probe compression technique; Ultrasonography,heparin; Article; B scan; case report; catheter complication; child; clinical article; color Doppler flowmetry; device removal; disease exacerbation; Duchenne muscular dystrophy; fibrin sheath; Gray scale echography; heart failure; human; imaging; male; patient monitoring; priority journal; probe compression technique; school child,2-s2.0-85046036075

We retrospectively evaluated 12 initial and 28 follow-up images from 12 patients diagnosed with either intracranial VAD or carotid artery dissection. The image quality for displaying the vessel wall was scored using a five-point scale (1 poor, 5 excellent) on initial T1-weighted isoFSE images for each region of the arteries. The intracranial artery dissection findings assessed at time points after onset were evaluated on initial and follow-up T1/T2-weighted isoFSE images. For small arteries, including the anterior/posterior inferior cerebellar artery, similar high scores were obtained on both unenhanced and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted isoFSE images (average: 4.7–5.0, p > 0.2). On unenhanced images, dissected vertebral arteries showed significantly lower scores than non-dissected vertebral arteries for both readers (p = 0.017 and 0.015, respectively), but the scores were high (3.9 and 4.0, respectively). Definitive findings of VAD were observed on the initial images except in one case. For all cases, definitive findings were seen on at least one of the initial or follow-up images. Temporal changes in the findings could be observed for all cases. In conclusion, we showed favorable wall visualization on T1-weighted isoFSE images and the utility of follow-up imaging using unenhanced-T1/T2-weighted and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted isoFSE sequences with acceptable scan times, which could promote the regular use of 3D black-blood vessel wall imaging. ? 2018, Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.",3T MR imaging; Intracranial artery dissection; isoFSE; Variable flip angle fast-spin echo sequence; Vertebrobasilar artery dissection,"adult; anterior inferior cerebellar artery; artery dissection; artery wall; Article; basilar artery; cerebral artery disease; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; follow up; human; image analysis; image display; image quality; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; posterior inferior cerebellar artery; priority journal; radiological procedures; rating scale; retrospective study; scoring system; three dimensional imaging; variable flip angle three dimensional fast spin echo sequence; vertebrobasilar artery dissection; artery dissection; diagnostic imaging; female; magnetic resonance angiography; male; middle aged; time factor; Adult; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Angiography; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Vertebral Artery Dissection",2-s2.0-85046017028

The expression of diagnostic markers in this disease is similar to that of clear-cell carcinoma, but the molecular carcinogenic events and therapeutic targets are mostly unknown. MET gene amplification has been reported in various cancers, including ovarian clear-cell carcinomas; however, the MET gene status has not previously been examined in ECC. We performed real-time quantitative PCR (QPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) to analyze the MET gene statuses of 12 ECC cases. We found MET amplifications in two cases (2/12; 16.7%) by both methods. Of the 12 cases, 9 were pure clear-cell carcinomas, and 3 were mixed types that included mixes with endometrioid carcinomas in 2 cases, and the remaining case was a heterologous-type carcinosarcoma that primarily consisted of a clear-cell carcinoma component and a scarce chondrosarcoma component. Both of the MET amplification cases were mixed; one contained endometrioid features, and the other chondrosarcoma features. This is the first report to analyze the statuses of the MET gene in ECCs, and the two mixed cases exhibited amplifications that are shared with ovarian clear-cell carcinomas.

Reports of hepatitis B infection were retrieved from the FAERS database. The reporting odds ratio (ROR) was used to estimate the association between hepatitis B infection and various anticancer agents and drug combinations. We detected statistically significant risk signals of hepatitis B for 33 of 64 anticancer agents by ROR (26 cytotoxicity drugs and seven molecular-targeted drugs). We focused on molecular-targeted drugs and assessed the risk of hepatitis B from specific anticancer drug combinations. The frequency of hepatitis B infection was significantly high for drugs such as rituximab, bortezomib, imatinib, and everolimus. The addition of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and fludarabine to drug combinations additively enhanced the frequency of hepatitis B infection. There were no reports on hepatitis B infection associated with trastuzumab or azacitidine monotherapy. However, trastuzumab-containing regimens (e.g., combinations with docetaxel or paclitaxel) were correlated with the incidence of hepatitis B infection, similar to azacitidine monotherapy. Our findings suggest that the concomitant use of anticancer drugs, such as trastuzumab, taxane, and azacitidine, may contribute to the risk of hepatitis B infection. The unique signals detected from the public database might provide clues to eliminate the threat of HBV in oncology. ? 2018 The Authors.

This study aimed to identify useful computed tomography (CT) features for distinguishing between these two conditions. Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed preoperative CT images of 27 TET, which included 40 PD and 40 FA lesions. Two radiologists independently interpreted the pleural lesions without knowing the final diagnosis. The CT images were evaluated to assess the lesion location, size, and shape, presence of a spinous shadow and ground glass opacities (GGO) near to the lesion, and the shortest distance from the lesion to the nearest peripheral pulmonary artery (PA). Results: FA lesions tended to occur on the dorsal side (90%, P = 0.024); have shorter major and minor axes (P < 0.001), a triangular shape (43%, P = 0.002), a spinous shadow (45%, P = 0.001) and GGO (28%, P = 0.006); and be close to a peripheral PA (P = 0.007). Ninety percent of PD lesions were located in the left thorax, and all of them were ipsilateral to the tumor (both P < 0.001). The 9 examined factors exhibited sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive, and negative predictive values of 85%, 95%, 94%, and 86%, respectively, for diagnosing FA (when ?3 factors were present), and 90%, 48%, 63%, and 83%, respectively, for diagnosing PD (when ?4 factors were present). Conclusion: The site, size, and shape of a lesion; the presence of a spinous shadow/GGO; and the distance to the nearest PA are useful for distinguishing between PD and FA. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Atelectasis; Dissemination; Mediastinum; Thymoma,"adult; aged; Article; atelectasis; clinical article; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; epithelium tumor; female; human; male; pleura metastasis; prediction; predictive value; preoperative evaluation; preoperative period; priority journal; pulmonary artery; radiologist; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; thymus cancer; tumor volume; atelectasis; complication; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; lung; middle aged; neoplasm; pathology; pleura; pleura tumor; preoperative care; procedures; secondary; thymoma; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adult; Aged; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Lung; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms, Glandular and Epithelial; Pleura; Pleural Neoplasms; Preoperative Care; Pulmonary Atelectasis; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Thymus Neoplasms; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85045248823

They are potentially an intrinsic feature of the smooth muscle, but interstitial cells in the mucosa and the detrusor itself, as well as other muscular elements in the mucosa may substantially influence them. They are identified in several models explaining lower urinary tract dysfunction. Methods: A consensus meeting at the International Consultation on Incontinence Research Society (ICI-RS) 2017 congress considered the origins and relevance of spontaneous bladder contractions by debating which cell type(s) modulate bladder spontaneous activity, whether the methodologies are sufficiently robust, and implications for healthy and abnormal lower urinary tract function. Results: The identified research priorities reflect a wide range of unknown aspects. Cellular contributions to spontaneous contractions in detrusor smooth muscle are still uncertain. Accordingly, insight into the cellular physiology of the bladder wall, particularly smooth muscle cells, interstitial cells, and urothelium, remains important. Upstream influences, such as innervation, endocrine, and paracrine factors, are particularly important. The cellular interactions represent the key understanding to derive the integrative physiology of organ function, notably the nature of signalling between mucosa and detrusor layers. Indeed, it is still not clear to what extent spontaneous contractions generated in isolated preparations mirror their normal and pathological counterparts in the intact bladder. Improved models of how spontaneous contractions influence pressure generation and sensory nerve function are also needed. Conclusions: Deriving approaches to robust evaluation of spontaneous contractions and their influences for experimental and clinical use could yield considerable progress in functional urology. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",detrusor overactivity; detrusor underactivity; LUTS; overactive bladder; physiology,"Article; bladder contraction; bladder filling; cells by body anatomy; detrusor smooth muscle cell; fibroblast; human; immunocompetent cell; Leydig cell; live cell imaging; micturition; muscularis mucosa cell; myography; nerve cell; nonhuman; patch clamp technique; spontaneous rhythmic contraction; urethra pressure; urothelium cell; vascular smooth muscle cell; viscoelasticity; bladder disease; interstitial cell of Cajal; muscle contraction; pathophysiology; physiology; smooth muscle; smooth muscle cell; urothelium; Humans; Interstitial Cells of Cajal; Muscle Contraction; Muscle, Smooth; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; Urinary Bladder Diseases; Urothelium",2-s2.0-85040866620

The purpose of this multicentre retrospective cohort study was to investigate the relationships between various risk factors, treatment modalities, and refractory hypoesthesia. Risk factors for refractory hypoesthesia after oral surgery were evaluated using univariate and multivariate analysis. To minimize the selection bias associated with a retrospective data analysis, a propensity score analysis was performed between the medication and non-medication groups (65 sites in each group). Moderate or severe hypoesthesia (odds ratio 13.42) and no or late administration of ATP/vitamin B12 (odds ratio 2.28) were significantly associated with refractory hypoesthesia. In the propensity score analysis, the incidence rate of refractory hypoesthesia in the medication group was lower than that in the non-medication group (P < 0.001). This study demonstrated the multivariate relationships between various risk factors, treatment modalities, and refractory hypoesthesia. Moderate or severe hypoesthesia and no or late administration of ATP/vitamin B12 were significantly associated with refractory hypoesthesia.

The aim of this study was to clarify long-term outcomes for surviving infants with birth weights ?500 g. Methods: The study population comprised fetuses of gestational age ?22 weeks, expected live- or stillbirth weight ?500 g, and birth date between 2003 and 2012. Developmental assessments were performed prospectively at 3 years old. Results: Data were obtained for 21 fetuses, including 10 live births and 11 stillbirths. Of the 10 live births, median gestational age was 25.2 weeks (range, 22.4–27.1 weeks), median birth weight was 426 g (range, 370–483 g), and two neonates died before discharge. One infant with severe asphyxia died within 12 h and another infant with Down syndrome died at 34 days. The survival rate was thus 80%. All surviving infants were small for gestational age. Seven of the 8 surviving infants (88%) weighed less than 2500 g at a corrected age of 40 weeks. Seven infants were available for developmental assessments at 3 years old. One infant could not be followed. Two of those seven infants (29%) showed normal development, three infants (42%) showed mild neurodevelopmental disability, and two infants (29%) showed severe neurodevelopmental disability. One infant had periventricular leukomalacia and cerebral palsy. Two of the seven infants (29%) had short stature (<3 SD) at 3 years old. Conclusion: Although the survival rate among live births was good (80%) in this study, neurodevelopmental outcomes remained poor in infants with birth weights ?500 g.

This paper verifies experimentally the optimum lead distance to support VI while walking. In the experiment, each subject (normal vision) walked while wearing an eye mask to simulate VI, holding a white cane, and received voice guidance. After each trial, the subject scored the lead distance in terms of acceptability. 28 young healthy males/females participated. Results showed the highest score was for 3 m while the lowest was for 5 m. Distance range with score over 3 (average) was 2 to 4 m. No clear significant difference was observed in terms of subject height. As walking speed was around 0.55 m/s, 1 m was deemed insufficient. 5 m or more seemed to be too long as subjects failed to predict accurately how far they had moved.

Then, we performed expression microarray analysis using these cells, and pathway analysis revealed that the expression of members of the GPCR downstream pathway displayed the most significant changes induced by the knockdown of P-REX2a. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that Vav1, a member of the GPCR downstream pathway, was expressed in 139 of the 155 endometrial tumors, and the expression levels of Vav1 and P-REX2a showed a positive correlation (r = 0.44, p < 0.001). In conclusion, P-REX2a enhanced cell motility via the GPCR downstream pathway independently of PTEN leading to progression of uterine endometrioid malignancies and poor prognosis of the patients. ?

The aim of this study was to examine the potential differences in workers’ diets based on the classification of workers into smaller occupational groups that comprise “large occupational categories”. The subjects of this study were working fathers who had participated in the Japan Environment and Children’s Study (N = 38,656). Energy and nutrient intake were calculated based on data collected from the Food Frequency Questionnaire. Occupations were classified according to the Japanese Standard Occupational Classification. Logistic regression analyses were performed to examine the adherence to current dietary recommendations within smaller occupational groups. In particular, significant differences were observed among the categorical groups of “professional and engineering workers”, “service workers”, and “agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers”. In “professional and engineering workers”, teachers showed higher odds of adherence to calcium intake recommendations compared with nurses (OR, 2.54; 95% CI, 2.02–3.14; p < 0.001). In “agricultural, forestry, and fishery workers”, agriculture workers showed higher odds of adherence to calcium (OR, 2.15; 95% CI, 1.46–3.15; p < 0.001) and vitamin C (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.31–2.74, p = 0.001) intake recommendations compared with forestry and fishery workers.

Methods: We collected data on demographics, Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI), and the ROM of large joints including the shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, and ankle. Associations between the ROM of each joint and disability in the eight HAQ-DI categories were determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and logistic regression analyses. ROM cut-off values of each joint for the absence of disability in each HAQ-DI category were determined using ROC curves. Results: A total of 460 patients were enrolled and analyzed in this study. Based on ROC analysis, the ROM of each joint was significantly associated with disability in each category. After adjusting for disease activity, age, and sex, shoulder abduction had the highest independent impact on disability in activity [cut-off: 139 degrees (OR: 5.26)], elbow flexion-extension in dressing [121 degrees (OR: 2.22)], wrist flexion-extension in reach [86 degrees (OR: 2.71)], hip flexion-extension in walking [126 degrees (OR: 3.42)], and knee flexion-extension in walking [134 degrees (OR: 2.97)]. Conclusions: Limited ROM of multiple joints was significantly associated with functional impairment in patients with long-standing RA. Motion in daily activity involves multiple joints, and at least two joints were independently involved in disability. ? 2017 Japan College of Rheumatology.",outcome measure; physical function; rehabilitation; Rheumatoid arthritis; total joint replacement,"adult; ankle; Article; cohort analysis; DAS28; eating; elbow; elbow flexion; female; Health Assessment Questionnaire; hip; human; hygiene; joint characteristics and functions; joint surgery; knee; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; observational study; physical activity; priority journal; pronation; prospective study; range of motion; receiver operating characteristic; rheumatoid arthritis; sensitivity and specificity; shoulder; supination; walking; wrist; aged; clinical trial; daily life activity; joint; joint characteristics and functions; pathology; pathophysiology; postoperative complication; replacement arthroplasty; rheumatoid arthritis; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Arthroplasty, Replacement; Female; Humans; Joints; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Range of Motion, Articular",2-s2.0-85025828523

While the exact pathogenesis of FCE remains unclear, it has been proposed in some cases that there is an association with the inflammation in the outer retina. We present a case of FCE development that was detected by spectral domain OCT (SD-OCT) and found to be associated with multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS). A 40-year-old Japanese woman was diagnosed with MEWDS based on multiple white dots observed from the posterior pole to the midperiphery, along with yellow granularity in the fovea. SD-OCT revealed separation between the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and Bruch's membrane (BM) and discontinuations of the ellipsoid zone, RPE, and BM. At 4 weeks after onset, several of the white dots disappeared, the yellow granularity in the fovea became small, and we detected nonconforming choroidal excavation under the central fovea. The choroidal excavation gradually deepened and changed to a conforming pattern. These findings suggest that the degree of the impairment caused by inflammation and the plasticity of the BM and RPE complex may be associated with different types of acquired FCE. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Choroidal excavation; Choroidal thickness; Multiple evanescent white dot syndrome; Optical coherence tomography,prednisolone; adult; Article; best corrected visual acuity; blurred vision; Bruch membrane; case report; chorioretinopathy; choroid disease; choroidal thickness; clinical article; cold; disease association; disease course; female; fluorescence angiography; focal choroidal excavation; human; indocyanine green angiography; inflammation; intraocular pressure; Japanese (citizen); multiple evanescent white dot syndrome; ophthalmoscopy; priority journal; retina detachment; retina fovea; retinal ganglion cell layer; retinal outer nuclear layer; retinal pigment epithelium; slit lamp microscopy; spectral domain optical coherence tomography; subretinal fluid; vision test,2-s2.0-85052922536

Patients ?20 and &lt;80?years old with a documented diagnosis of symptomatic multiple myeloma (MM) who received one or more prior therapies were randomized to receive BD (Bor 1.3?mg/m2) or TD (Thal 200?mg/d). In both arms, 8 cycles of induction (3-week cycle) were followed by maintenance phase (5-week cycle) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal. The primary end-point was 1-year progression-free survival (PFS). Forty-four patients were randomized and assigned to receive BD and TD (n?=?22, each group). At a median follow-up of 34.3?months, the 1-year PFS in the BD and TD arms were 45.5% (95% confidence interval (CI), 24.4%-64.3%) and 31.8% (95% CI, 14.2%-51.1%), respectively, and the overall response rates were 77.3% and 40.9%, respectively. The 3-year overall survival (OS) was 70.0% (95% CI, 44.9%-85.4%) in the BD, and 48.8% (95% CI, 25.1%-69.0%) in the TD arm.

However, it remains controversial as to whether intrinsic processing of motor learning is impaired in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), and if yes, whether the impairment is associated with altered striatal dopamine release. Additionally, most neuro-imaging studies of patients with PD have focused on motor sequence learning. In contrast, skill acquisition, specifically, the reconstruction of muscle control of isolated movements, has barely been studied. Method In this study, we used a repetitive skill training task to measure the peak acceleration of left thumb movement during a process to achieve fine tuning of motor skill. Using 11C-raclopride (RAC) positron emission tomography, we investigated changes in striatal dopamine levels in two conditions of a skill acquisition task: initial skill training (Day 1) and acquired condition (Day 2) with eight patients with PD and age-matched healthy subjects (HS). Result In HS, the mean acceleration of each session improved through repeated training sessions on Day 1. However, in patients with PD, the training-associated increase was less than that for HS, and this suggests that repetitive skill training does not result in the effective improvement of motor performance. The regions of interest (ROI) analysis revealed that the RAC-binding potential (BP) was significantly reduced in the right putamen on Day 1 compared with Day 2 in HS. In patients with PD, BP within the right putamen was unchanged. Further, we found that patients with PD had increased dopamine levels within the right ventral striatum (VST) and right caudate (CAU) on Day 2, which was greater than that in HS. These results suggest the impaired activation of the putamen during skill acquisition in patients with PD and compensated hyperactivation of the VST and CAU for the reduced dopamine release within the dorsal putamen (DPU). Conclusion Our findings suggest that patients with PD had insufficiency in the process to improve motor skills. Different patterns of striatal dopamine release are relevant to the impairment of these motor functions in patients with PD, at the early stage of the disease. ? 2018 Kawashima et al.

In an attempt to search for its potential substrates other than nucleobases in this study, we could successfully find urate, a metabolic derivative of purine nucleobases, as a novel substrate, as indicated by its specific Na + -dependent and saturable transport, with a Michaelis constant of 433?μmol/L, by rat SNBT1 (rSNBT1) stably expressed in Madin-Darby canine kidney II cells. However, urate uptake was observed only barely in the everted tissue sacs of the rat small intestine, in which rSNBT1 operates for nucleobase uptake. These findings suggested that urate undergoes a futile cycle, in which urate transported into epithelial cells is immediately effluxed back by urate efflux transporters, in the small intestine. In subsequent attempts to examine that possibility, such a futile urate cycle was demonstrated in the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line as a model cell system, where urate uptake induced by transiently introduced rSNBT1 was extensively reduced by the co-introduction of rat breast cancer resistance protein (rBCRP), a urate efflux transporter present in the small intestine. However, urate uptake was not raised in the presence of Ko143, a BCRP inhibitor, in the everted intestinal tissue sacs, suggesting that some other transporter might also be involved in urate efflux. The newly found urate transport function of SNBT1, together with the suggested futile urate cycle in the small intestine, should be of interest for its evolutional and biological implications, although SNBT1 is genetically deficient in humans. ? 2018 The Authors.

In this study, we examine the impact of socioeconomic situations of children’s families during their early childhood on the children’s social adaptation in Japanese elementary school. Methods The current investigation consisted of two sets of data relating to two separate years (with a one-year interval). The participants included preschoolers aged five years at Time 1 (the first year) and first graders aged six years at Time 2 (the second year); 1,712 met the inclusion criteria for both years. Parents of the participants completed a self-reported questionnaire regarding their SES (i.e., family economy and mother’s education) and their children’s mental health. Mental health was assessed using the Child Behavior Checklist/4–18, Parent Report. Results For each SES indicator, we found an inverse relationship across all the symptom dimensions. Specifically, bivariate analyses revealed that lower family income, maternal education level, and paternal education level predict all three domains of behavioral problems (i.e., internalized problems, externalized problems, and total behavioral problems). Further, multivariate analyses revealed that lower family income consistently predicts all domains of behavioral problems, lower maternal education level predicted externalized problems and total behavioral problems, and paternal education level did not predict any clinically significant behavioral problems. Conclusion In this sample, we found that, for children, family income and parental education when entering preschool were significant predictors of mental health problems after elementary school enrollment; in particular, low income and low maternal educational achievement predicted a high probability of the development of a psychiatric disorder. A greater understanding of the mechanisms of these associations could contribute to improvements in interventions aimed at preventing child maladjustment. ? 2018 Hosokawa, Katsura.

Elderly participants in a project to prevent long-term care need were given a selfadministered questionnaire and tested by pure-tone audiometry. One hundred fifty were taken as subjects. Forty-one of these subjects (27.3%) were found to have poor mental health. The results of multiple logistic regression analysis with mental health level as the dependent variable indicated that subjects 65-74 years old who did not think their own hearing was bad had better mental health than those who did think their hearing was bad (odds ratio 10.800). Among subjects 75 years and older, those who had not been certified as needing long-term care had better mental health than those who had been certified (odds ratio 3.937). When planning mental health support for community-dwelling elderly in the future, it will be necessary to consider differences in background due to age group. The present results suggest that appropriate support for awareness of hearing and acceptance of decreased hearing ability in people in early old age (65-74 years old) may help to prevent declining mental health in later old age. ? 2017, Nagoya University.",Community-dwelling elderly; Hearing; Mental health,,2-s2.0-85047446048

Patients with FIGO stage IB1-IIA2 squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix were enrolled. Histological confirmation of LNM was mandatory. Intravenous paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 and nedaplatin at 80 mg/m2 were administered every 28-day cycle, of which there were 5 cycles after radical hysterectomy. Sixty-two patients were enrolled in the study from November 2011 to July 2015. Their median age was 48.5 years (range 28-64). The median tumor diameter was 37 mm (5-64). Overall, 30 patients (48.4%) had 1 metastatic lymph node, 11 (17.7%) had 2, 3 (4.8%) had 3, 5 (8.1%) had 4, and 13 (21.0%) had 5 or more. With a median follow-up of 45.7 months (range 23.4-69.5), the 2-year relapse-free survival and 2-year overall survival rates were 79.0% (90% CI, 69.0%-86.2%) and 93.5% (95% CI, 83.7%-97.5%), respectively. Almost all adverse events were relatively mild. Grade 3-4 adverse events (NCI-CTC ver. 4.0) that occurred in 5% or more of patients were neutropenia (60.7%) and infection (6.6%). The proportion of patients who completed 5 cycles of treatment was 90.3%. Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy with TN for cervical cancer with LNM was demonstrated to be an effective and feasible treatment. A phase III trial is warranted to compare this with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. ? 2018 The Authors.

Influenza A viruses are categorized by H (hemagglutinin; HA) and N (neuraminidase; NA) proteins expressed on the viral envelope surface. Analyses of past pandemics suggest that the HA gene segment comes from a nonhuman virus, which is then introduced into an immunologically na?ve human population with potentially devastating consequences. As a prerequisite for infection, the nonhuman HA molecules of H1–H16 viruses must be able to bind to specific sialyl receptors on the host cell surface along the human respiratory tract. Thus, additional insight into the structures of host cell glycans and how different HAs interact with different glycans might provide new insight into the mechanisms underlying sustained infection and transmission in humans. In this work, we identified the sialyl N-glycans found in normal human alveoli and characterized the influenza viruses that preferentially bound to these different structures. We also determined the amino acid changes in HA that were linked to a switch of receptor-binding preference from nonhuman to pandemic, as well as pandemic to seasonal. Our data provide insight into why seasonal viruses are associated with reduced alveolar infection and damage and suggest new considerations for designing anti-HA vaccines and drugs. The results provide a better understanding of viral tropism and pathogenesis in humans that will be important for prediction and surveillance of zoonotic, pandemic, and epidemic influenza outbreaks.

The clonality detection rates, however, have not been very high with these methods using paraffin-embedded tumor sections. We previously described the usefulness of the semi-nested BIOMED-2 IGH assay in B-cell malignancies. In this study, we devised a novel semi-nested BIOMED-2 IGK assay. Employing 58 cases of classical HL, we carried out the standard BIOMED-2, BIOMED-2 followed by BIOMED-2 re-amplification, and BIOMED-2 followed by semi-nested BIOMED-2, all targeting IGH and IGK, using paraffin-embedded tissues. In both IGH and IGK assays, semi-nested assays yielded significantly higher clonality detection rates than the standard assays and re-amplification assays. Clonality was detected in 13/58 (22.4%) classical HL cases using the standard IGH/IGK assays while it was detected in 38/58 (65.5%) cases using semi-nested IGH/IGK assays. The detection rates were not associated with the HL subtypes, CD30-positive cell density, CD20-positive cell density, or Epstein–Barr virus (EBV) positivity. In conclusion, tumor clonality was detected in nearly two-thirds of classical HL cases using semi-nested BIOMED-2 IGH/IGK assays using paraffin tumor sections. These semi-nested assays may be useful when the standard IGH/IGK assays fail to detect clonality in histopathologically suspected HLs. ? 2018 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",BIOMED-2 PCR assay; formalin-fixed; Hodgkin lymphoma; IGH gene; IGK gene; immunoglobulin gene rearrangements; paraffin-embedded tissues; semi-nested modification,"CD20 antigen; CD30 ligand; genomic DNA; immunoglobulin heavy chain; immunoglobulin kappa chain; paraffin; immunoglobulin kappa chain; paraffin; Article; cancer diagnosis; cell density; cell proliferation; classical Hodgkin lymphoma; clonal variation; comparative study; controlled study; Epstein Barr virus; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunoglobulin class switching; immunoglobulin gene; lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin lymphoma; major clinical study; mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma; molecular diagnosis; nested polymerase chain reaction; nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma; priority journal; tumor immunity; cell clone; genetics; Hodgkin disease; immunoglobulin class switching; immunoglobulin heavy chain gene; immunology; procedures; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; Clone Cells; Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Heavy Chain; Gene Rearrangement, B-Lymphocyte, Light Chain; Genes, Immunoglobulin Heavy Chain; Hodgkin Disease; Humans; Immunoglobulin kappa-Chains; Paraffin Embedding; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction",2-s2.0-85044344753

The aim of this study was to investigate how differently an auditory stimulus (AS) influences execution function and execution time during a cognitively demanding stepping task in PD patients as compared to healthy controls. PD patients and healthy controls stepped forward in response to a visual imperative stimulus of an arrow. We applied a Simon task that comprised congruent and incongruent conditions. Direction and location of the arrow matched in the congruent condition, while they didn't in the incongruent condition. AS were randomly and simultaneously presented with the visual stimulus. An error in the direction of an anticipatory postural adjustment (APA), termed an APA error, and temporal parameters (reaction onset of APA and APA duration) were analyzed. As a result, the AS increased the APA error rate in the control group regardless of the condition, but they did not influence it in the PD group. The AS also speeded the reaction onset in both groups regardless of the condition. The APA duration was prolonged by the AS for the control group, while it was unaffected by the AS for the PD group in both conditions. These findings indicate that AS could facilitate a step initiation, conceivably by facilitating a stimulus identification process and increasing attentional control of stepping behavior, without influencing a decision-making process even in a cognitively demanding condition in patients with PD. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Anticipatory postural adjustment; Auditory stimulus; Executive function; Parkinson's disease; Start hesitation; Step initiation,aged; Article; auditory stimulation; body position; clinical article; controlled study; decision making; executive function; female; ground reaction force; Hoehn and Yahr scale; human; male; Parkinson disease; priority journal; task performance; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; visual stimulation; body equilibrium; hearing; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; psychology; psychomotor performance; vision; walking; Acoustic Stimulation; Aged; Auditory Perception; Decision Making; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Male; Parkinson Disease; Postural Balance; Psychomotor Performance; Visual Perception; Walking,2-s2.0-85044122085

Coverage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus faecalis is also recommended for hospital-associated IAI. A nationwide survey was conducted to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from postoperative IAI. All 504 isolates were collected at 26 institutions and referred to a central laboratory for susceptibility testing. Lower susceptibility rates to ciprofloxacin and cefepime were demonstrated in Escherichia coli. Among E. coli, 24.1% of strains produced extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL). Carbapenems, piperacillin/tazobactam, cephamycins/oxacephem, aminoglycosides, and tigecycline had high activity against E. coli, including ESBL-producing isolates. Among E. cloacae, low susceptibility rates to ceftazidime were demonstrated, whereas cefepime retained its activity. P. aeruginosa revealed high susceptibility rates to all antimicrobials tested except for imipenem. Among B. fragilis group species, low levels of susceptibility were observed for cefoxitin, moxifloxacin, and clindamycin, and high susceptibility rates were observed for piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, and metronidazole. Ampicillin, piperacillin, and glycopeptides had good activity against E. faecalis. Imipenem had the highest activity against E. faecalis among carbapenems. In conclusion, we suggested the empirical use of antimicrobials with the specific intent of covering the main organisms isolated from postoperative IAI. Piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, or doripenem, are appropriate in critically ill patients.

The androgen receptor (AR) is proposed as a therapeutic target for AR-positive advanced triple-negative breast cancer. We herein investigated the effects of a treatment with antiandrogens on the functional activity, activation kinetics, transcriptional expression, and protein degradation of KCa1.1 in human breast cancer MDA-MB-453 cells using real-time PCR, Western blotting, voltage-sensitive dye imaging, and whole-cell patch clamp recording. A treatment with the antiandrogen bicalutamide or enzalutamide for 48 h significantly suppressed (1) depolarization responses induced by paxilline (PAX), a specific KCa1.1 blocker and (2) PAX-sensitive outward currents induced by the depolarizing voltage step. The expression levels of KCa1.1 transcripts and proteins were significantly decreased in MDA-MB-453 cells, and the protein degradation of KCa1.1 mainly contributed to reductions in KCa1.1 activity. Among the eight regulatory β and γ subunits, LRRC26 alone was expressed at high levels in MDA-MB-453 cells and primary and metastatic breast cancer tissues, whereas no significant changes were observed in the expression levels of LRRC26 and activation kinetics of PAX-sensitive outward currents in MDA-MB-453 cells by the treatment with antiandrogens. The treatment with antiandrogens up-regulated the expression of the ubiquitin E3 ligases, FBW7, MDM2, and MDM4 in MDA-MB-453 cells, and the protein degradation of KCa1.1 was significantly inhibited by the respective siRNA-mediated blockade of FBW7 and MDM2. Based on these results, we concluded that KCa1.1 is an androgen-responsive gene in AR-positive breast cancer cells, and its down-regulation through enhancements in its protein degradation by FBW7 and/or MDM2 may contribute, at least in part, to the antiproliferative and antimetastatic effects of antiandrogens in breast cancer cells. ? 2018 Khatun, Shimozawa, Kito, Kawaguchi, Fujimoto, Ri, Kajikuri, Niwa, Fujii and Ohya.",Androgen receptor; Antiandrogen; Breast cancer; Ca2+-activated K+ channel; KCa1.1; Ubiquitin E3 ligase,androgen receptor; bicalutamide; calcium activated potassium channel; carrier proteins and binding proteins; enzalutamide; leucine rich repeat containing protein 26; mammalian target of rapamycin; phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase; potassium channel Kca1.1; protein kinase B; protein MDM2; protein MDMX; ubiquitin protein ligase E3; unclassified drug; aged; Akt signaling; antiproliferative activity; Article; breast cancer; breast cancer cell line; cell viability; controlled study; depolarization; down regulation; drug effect; female; human; human cell; human tissue; metastasis; metastasis inhibition; protein degradation; protein expression; transcription regulation; upregulation,2-s2.0-85045506540

To avoid unnecessary neoadjuvant therapy and to plan the appropriate surgical treatment, surveillance of RHC therapeutic efficacy during treatment is necessary. In this study, we determined the optimal response criteria to evaluate the efficacy of RHC by comparing preoperative images before and after RHC with pathological evaluation of necrosis in the resected tumor. Patients and methods From 2004 to 2014, 20 patients were enrolled into this study. Needle biopsy revealed 6 cases of myxoid liposarcoma, 6 cases of undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma, 4 cases of myxofibrosarcoma, and 4 cases of synovial sarcoma. Based on the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or modified RECIST, we calculated the responses to RHC therapy by comparing pre- and post-RHC therapy images. In addition, resected specimens underwent pathological analysis to evaluate response based on tumor necrosis. The correlation between assessment based on preoperative images and resected tumors were evaluated by the Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient. Result From the surgical specimens, pathological assessment of necrosis in resected tumor were assessed as less than 50% (2 cases), 50–90% (9 cases), 90–99% (6 cases), and total necrosis (3 cases). Use of the RECIST 1.1 underestimated good responders as stable disease (SD) or progressive disease (PD) in 5 out of 15 cases; on the other hand, use of the modified RECIST did not underestimate the pathological assessment of necrosis. The correlations between responses based on preoperative images and those based on histological assessments were 0.23 (RECIST 1.1) and 0.76 (modified RECIST). Conclusion Because pathological responses can be underestimated using the RECIST 1.1, the modified RECIST, which take into consideration tumor viability, as assessed by contrast MRI, should also be considered when evaluating the efficacy of RHC. ? 2018 Aiba et al.

Novel drugs are required to treat such severe pain without necessitating the use of adjuvant analgesics. Tapentadol is a new drug that has a dual mechanism as both an opioid agonist and noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor. The study objective was to investigate the effectiveness of oral tapentadol for relieving cancer-related neuropathic pain. Methods: A retrospective, single-center, open, non-randomized study was conducted at the Nagoya City University Hospital. The study included 38 Japanese patients with advanced cancer who received opioids, such as tramadol, oral oxycodone and transdermal fentanyl, with or without adjuvant analgesics. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Numerical Rating Scale, primary tumor type, primary opioid and tapentadol doses, adjuvant analgesic prescriptions, outcomes and adverse events of opioid switching were assessed for 7 days. Results: Eighteen (47.3%) out of 38 patients were enrolled in this study. The average performance status was 2.13 ± 0.94 (mean ± standard deviation). After switching to oral tapentadol, the pain score decreased from 3.78 to 2.78. The patients who had clinically improved effective pain scores had a higher percentage of prior opioid use formore than 2 months. After switching to tapentadol, adverse events were usuallymild, with a grade of 1-2 by the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. Conclusions: Tapentadol appears to have an acceptable safety margin and promising efficacy to relieve cancer-related neuropathic pain that is refractory to first-line opioid treatment. ?

Evaluation of specimen adequacy is the most important aspect of quality assurance and for precise diagnosis in TBS. A systematic review and meta-analysis were carried out to assess the unsatisfactory specimen rate in the primary cervical cancer screening setting in Japan. Ovid Medline and Ichushi-Web databases were searched from inception through to May 2017. Prospective and retrospective studies that reported the proportion of unsatisfactory specimens in healthy asymptomatic Japanese women in a cervical cancer screening program were eligible for inclusion; 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The random-effects model meta-analysis calculated summary estimates of the unsatisfactory rate of 0.60% (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.18-1.96%; I2 = 99%) for conventional cytology and 0.04% (95% CI, 0.00-0.35%; I2 = 99%) for liquid-based cytology (LBC). However, comparative results between conventional and liquid-based cytology, based on four direct and nine comparative studies, showed no significant difference (summary odds ratio = 3.5 × 10?2 favoring LBC [95% CI, 6.9 × 10?4-1.7]; I2 = 98%). In the subgroup analyses and meta-regressions, use of non-cotton devices for conventional cytology and use of a particular platform for LBC were associated with lower unsatisfactory rates. Meta-regression also suggested chronological improvement in unsatisfactory rates for both tests. In Japanese cervical cancer screening programs, conventional cytology remains prevalent. Future research needs to focus on evaluating the impact of screening programs using LBC by comparing the accuracy, performance, and cost-effectiveness with conventional cytology in the Japanese population. ? 2018 The Authors.

The association was examined between the polymorphisms of PD1, PDL1, CTLA4 and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Methods: The study group consisted of 243 women with two or more pregnancy losses and 176 parous women. The frequency of three SNPs of PD1, two of PDL1, and four of CTLA4 were compared between the patients and controls. Next, the subsequent live birth rates in the patients with RPL with and without risk alleles were examined. Results: Two SNPs (rs36084323 and rs3481962) of PD1 were found to occur at significantly higher frequencies in the patient group than in the control group. The subsequent live birth rate of the patients with vs. without the risk alleles of rs36084323 and rs3481962 were 83.3% vs. 83.3% and 81.6% vs. 84.0%, respectively. Conclusion: Variations of the PD1 gene were identified as risk factors for RPL. However, the presence or absence of the PD1 risk alleles had no predictive effect on the subsequent pregnancy outcome. ? 2018 The Authors.

Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a fibrinolytic compound, is used as an adjuvant to displace submacular hemorrhage and to treat type 2 CNV. The purpose of this study was to investigate in in vitro and in vivo experiments the antiangiogenic impact of tPA itself. Methods: The impact of tPA on the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was assessed by an XTT assay [2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide]. A basic fibroblast growth factor-impregnated gelatin hydrogel sheet was implanted into the rabbit cornea to induce corneal neovascularization. Immediately postoperatively, tPA or buffered saline solution (control) was injected intravitreally. Results: The growth and viability of the HUVECs were unaffected by tPA at clinical concentrations. In the control group, the mean lengths of the new vessels were 1.0 ± 0.41, 1.6 ± 0.75, and 3.6 ± 2.1 mm at weeks 1, 2, and 4, respectively. In contrast, tPA significantly (p &lt; 0.01) reduced the corneal neovascularization. Conclusion: Although tPA has no direct impact on the vascular endothelial cells in vitro, the fibrinolytic effects of tPA might markedly suppress neovascularization in vivo. ? 2018 S.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the pattern of antibiotic use in ICUs. A nationwide one-day cross-sectional surveillance of antibiotic use in the ICU was conducted three times between January 2011 and December 2011. All patients aged at least16 years were included. Data from 52 ICUs and 1148 patients were reviewed. There were 1028 prescriptions for intravenous antibiotics. Of 1148 patients, 834 (73%) received at least one intravenous antibiotic, and 575 had at least one known site of infection. Respiratory and intra-abdominal infections were the two most common types. Of 1028 prescriptions, 331 (34%) were for surgical or medical prophylaxis. Excluding prophylaxis, carbapenems were the most commonly prescribed agent. Infectious disease consultations, pre- and post-prescription antimicrobial stewardship, and ICU-dedicated antibiograms were available in 44%, 52%, 77%, and 21% of the ICUs, respectively. In logistic regression analysis adjusting for patient characteristics, treatment in a university hospital (adjusted odds ratio, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.05–2.84; P = 0.033) and an open ICU (adjusted odds ratio, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.02–5.17; P = 0.044) were significantly associated with greater likelihood of carbapenem use. An increase in the number of closed ICUs and more intensive care specialists may reduce carbapenem use in Japanese ICUs.

However, few studies have determined the frequency and management of cross-sensitivity in patients with super-refractory status epilepticus (SRSE). Aims of the study: To examine the optimal AED for treating SRSE with cross-sensitivity. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of adult patients with SRSE treated at Nagoya City University Hospital, in which we investigated the frequency of cross-sensitivity among patients with SRSE and their clinical and medical profiles. Results: We identified 10 adult patients with SRSE, 5 of whom had cross-sensitivity. Stiripentol (STP) was administered when previously used AEDs had demonstrated cross-sensitivity and failed to control seizures. After initiation of STP, the dose of general anaesthetics was reduced, and status epilepticus (SE) eventually ceased with co-administered AEDs without additional adverse effects. The mean time to SE cessation after initiation of STP was 30.8?days (range, 18-46?days), mean duration of general anaesthesia was 101.2?days (range, 74-128?days), and mean number of AEDs was 9.0 (range, 6-11). Conclusions: This study suggests that cross-sensitivity between AEDs is common in adults with SRSE and that STP may be useful for treating SRSE with cross-sensitivity. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In the present study, we investigated the effect of ristocetin, a glycoprotein (GP)Ib/IX/V activator, on the release of HSP27 and the effect of anti-platelet agents, such as acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), on this release. Forty-six patients with type 2 DM were recruited, and classified into two groups depending on administration of anti-platelet agents, resulting in 31 patients without these agents (control group) and 15 patients with them (anti-platelet group). Ristocetin potently induced the aggregation of platelets in the two groups. Ristocetin-induced changes of the area under the curve of light transmittance and the ratio of the size of platelet aggregates in the anti-platelet group were slightly different from those in the control group. On the other hand, the levels of phosphorylated-HSP27 induced by ristocetin in the platelets from a patient of the anti-platelet group taking ASA were significantly lower than those from a patient of the control group. The levels of HSP27 release from the ristocetin-stimulated platelets were significantly correlated with the levels of phosphorylated-HSP27 in the platelets from patients in the two groups. The levels of HSP27 release and those of platelet-derived growth factor-AB (PDGF-AB) secretion stimulated by ristocetin in the anti-platelet group were lower than those in the control group. In addition, the levels of HSP27 release and those of PDGF-AB secretion stimulated by ADP in the anti-platelet group were lower than those in the control group.

In this study, we confirmed the efficacy of concomitant radiotherapy, hyperthermia, and chemotherapy (RHC) for neoadjuvant treatment of malignant soft tissue sarcoma (STS). From 1994 to 2013, we performed RHC in 150 patients. This study was limited to 60 patients using the following exclusion criteria: salvage for recurrence or unplanned excision, trunk location, metastasis at initiation, non-STS, and no definitive surgery. As a control group, we collected data from 11,031 patients in the Bone and Soft Tissue Tumor Registry in Japan (BSTT). We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis, and propensity scores were created for comparisons between groups. The primary outcome of this study was to compare oncologic outcomes (5-year local control rate [LC] and overall survival rate [OS]). In the RHC group, two local recurrences (3.3%) occurred, and no patients underwent amputation. Margins of definitive surgery were not identical between groups [wide margins (60.0% vs. 85.3%), marginal margins (28.3% vs. 10.5%), and intralesional margins (7.4% vs. 4.2%), RHC and BSTT groups, respectively, P?<?0.001]. After adjustment, the difference in OS was not significant between groups (HR?=?1.26, P?=?0.532); however, a statistically significant difference in LC was observed (HR?=?4.82, P?=?0.037). RHC resulted in a high LC at 5?years compared to the BSTT group, and amputation was averted in the RHC group, despite the wider margins in the BSTT group. This indicates that less invasive surgery might be achieved with effective neoadjuvant therapy. ? 2018 The Authors.

We used a population PK modeling approach using data from a clinical study involving 79 healthy male volunteers. A comprehensive population PK model considering the PK mechanism of moxifloxacin and its metabolites was newly built. The structures of the final model were two-compartment for moxifloxacin and one-compartment for M1 and M2, with first-order absorption with lag time for all three compounds. The formation of M1 and M2 from moxifloxacin via a first-pass effect and subsequent metabolic clearance in the system were also modeled. Lean body mass on the central volume of distribution (Vc) and estimated glomerular filtration rate on renal clearance (CLr) were identified as covariates of PKs of moxifloxacin. Additionally, bioavailability was slightly higher in Koreans, whereas CLr, non-renal clearance (CLnr), and Vc were slightly lower. Regarding M1 and M2, body surface area on CLr of M2 and UGT1A1*6 on F of M2 were modeled. Korean ethnicity was observed to influence CLnr of M2, F of M2, and the metabolic clearance of moxifloxacin to M2. However, the exposure levels of moxifloxacin, M1, and M2 in Koreans were comparable to those in Japanese and Chinese because the effects of Korean ethnicity on some PK parameters were counterbalanced. These results suggest that PKs for moxifloxacin and its metabolites among East Asian populations are essentially similar. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Ethnic difference; Global drug development; Metabolite; Moxifloxacin; NONMEM; Population pharmacokinetics,"bilirubin; drug metabolite; glucuronide; moxifloxacin; glucuronosyltransferase; moxifloxacin; UGT1A1 enzyme; adult; Article; body surface; Caucasian; central volume of distribution; Chinese; controlled study; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; drug blood level; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug urine level; East Asian; enterohepatic circulation; estimated glomerular filtration rate; ethnic difference; first pass effect; human; Japanese (people); Korean (people); lean body weight; limit of quantitation; major clinical study; male; metabolic clearance; molecular weight; pharmacokinetic parameters; priority journal; renal clearance; urinary excretion; Asian continental ancestry group; bioavailability; ethnic group; glomerulus filtration rate; kidney; metabolic clearance rate; metabolism; normal human; oral drug administration; physiology; young adult; Administration, Oral; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biological Availability; Ethnic Groups; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Glucuronosyltransferase; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Kidney; Male; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Moxifloxacin; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85034772999

PS is usually confined to the head and neck or skin. The pre-operative diagnosis of PS is difficult, and this has lead to a common misdiagnosis as a schwannoma. In addition, studies have indicated that an incomplete resection of PS often results in tumor recurrence. Here we describe a rare case of PS presented in the parapharyngeal space. Our case involved a 36-year-old man with swelling of the pharynx, who presented with a soft cervical mass. MRI revealed a multinodular mass in the left parapharyngeal space, and further pathological diagnosis by the referral hospital indicated schwannoma. A cervical approach was taken and the tumor was removed with preservation of the nerve sheath by intracapsular resection. The tumor recurred within one year after the first surgery in the same lesion of the left parapharyngeal space. The second surgical approach was a combination of a facial dismasking flap and trans-pterygopalatine fossa. The mass was resected completely, and the diagnosis of PS was confirmed by histopathology. While schwannoma commonly occurs in the head and neck, parapharyngeal space PS is rare, and pre-operative pathological diagnosis of PS is difficult. MRI studies of PS revealed distinctive features that we found useful in pre-operative diagnosis. Intracapsular resection of PS with nerve preservation has a very high recurrence rate of the tumor. Therefore, if MRI findings suggest PS we recommend removing the tumor completely without nerve preservation will offer the most curative outcome. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Carotid canal; Parapharyngeal space; Plexiform schwannoma; Schwannoma,"Ki 67 antigen; adult; Article; cancer surgery; case report; cell proliferation; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; follow up; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; male; miosis; needle biopsy; neurilemoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; paralysis; patient referral; pharynx tumor; physical examination; plexiform schwannoma; pterygopalatine fossa; ptosis; reoperation; soft palate; spindle cell; surgical approach; swelling; transcervical needle biopsy; tumor recurrence; carotid artery; diagnostic imaging; head and neck tumor; neurofibroma; pathology; pharynx; tumor recurrence; Adult; Carotid Arteries; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neurofibroma, Plexiform; Pharynx; Reoperation",2-s2.0-85018374156

Methods: A total of 262 patients who underwent lithotripsy (SWL, n = 61; URSL, n = 201) for upper urinary tract calculi treatment between June 2012 and January 2015 were evaluated. All patients were administered the Short-Form 36-item survey (SF-36) to assess HRQoL at four timepoints: before surgery, on the day of discharge, and 1 and 6?months after lithotripsy. Stone-free rates, complications, and analgesic requirements were evaluated to compare the effects of the two procedures on HRQoL. Results: At the day of discharge, patients in the URSL group had significantly lower mean scores on five different subscales of the SF-36 questionnaire, namely, physical functioning, role-physical, social functioning, role-emotional, and mental health. The stone-free rate at 3 months after lithotripsy was significantly lower in the SWL group (72.1% vs. URSL, 93.0%; p < 0.001). The hospital stay was shorter in the SWL group (2.1 ± 0.07 vs. URSL, 4.1 ± 0.13?days; p < 0.001), and the analgesia requirements were also lower in the SWL group (0.3 ± 0.08 vs. URSL, 0.9 ± 0.20; p < 0.001). Conclusions: The post-lithotripsy HRQoL was superior for SWL compared to URSL on the discharge date despite the lower stone-free rate of the former.

Our previous multiscale molecular network models of AD revealed TYROBP as a key driver of an immune- and microglia-specific network that was robustly associated with AD pathophysiology. Recent genetic studies of AD further identified pathogenic mutations in both TREM2 and TYROBP. Methods: In this study, we systematically examined molecular and pathological interactions among Aβ, tau, TREM2, and TYROBP by integrating signatures from transgenic Drosophila models of AD and transcriptome-wide gene co-expression networks from two human AD cohorts. Results: Glial expression of TREM2/TYROBP exacerbated tau-mediated neurodegeneration and synergistically affected pathways underlying late-onset AD pathology, while neuronal Aβ42 and glial TREM2/TYROBP synergistically altered expression of the genes in synaptic function and immune modules in AD. Conclusions: The comprehensive pathological and molecular data generated through this study strongly validate the causal role of TREM2/TYROBP in driving molecular networks in AD and AD-related phenotypes in flies. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides; Differential expression; Gene co-expression network; Gene module; Immune function; Microtubule-associated protein tau; Neurodegeneration; Synaptophagy; TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2); TYROBP (tyrosine kinase binding protein),"amyloid beta protein[1-42]; protein tyrosine kinase; tau protein; transcriptome; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2; tyrosine kinase binding protein; unclassified drug; amyloid beta protein; Drosophila protein; tau protein; tau protein, Drosophila; Alzheimer disease; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; Drosophila; female; gene expression; glia; male; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein expression; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; synapse; Alzheimer disease; animal; brain; disease model; Drosophila melanogaster; gene expression regulation; gene regulatory network; genetics; human; metabolism; nerve cell; nerve degeneration; pathology; transgenic animal; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Animals, Genetically Modified; Brain; Disease Models, Animal; Drosophila melanogaster; Drosophila Proteins; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Regulatory Networks; Humans; Male; Nerve Degeneration; Neuroglia; Neurons; Signal Transduction; Synapses; tau Proteins",2-s2.0-85044714824

The extract of bofutsushosan, a representative Kampo formulation, inhibited OATP2B1 function with sufficient levels to suppress absorption of OATP2B1 substrates in clinics. We further evaluated the inhibitory effects of several ingredients containing Rhei Rhizoma, Perillae Herba, and Moutan Cortex on OATP2B1. Conclusions Because of crude drugs used in Kampo medicines might suppress absorption of OATP2B1 substrates, these results may contribute to the safe and effective use of Kampo medicine in clinics.

Methods: Mouse mammary tumor cells were transplanted onto the calvaria or into a subcutaneous lesion of female mice, creating a TB-microE and a TS-microE, and the mice were then treated with hOCIF. To investigate the preventive effects of hOCIF, mice were treated with hOCIF before tumor cell implantation onto the calvaria (Pre), after (Post), and both before and after (Whole). The number of CSCs and cytokine levels were evaluated by IHC and ELISA assay, respectively. Results: hOCIF suppressed osteolysis, and growth of mammary tumors in the TB-microE, but not in the TS-microE. In the Pre, Post, and Whole groups, hOCIF suppressed osteolysis, and cell proliferation. hOCIF increased mouse osteoprotegrin (mOPG) levels in vivo, which suppressed mammary tumor cell proliferation in vitro. These preventive effects were observed in the dose-dependent. hOCIF did not affect the induction of CSCs in either microenvironment. Conclusion: While receptor activator of NF-κB ligand (RANKL) targeting therapy may not affect the induction of CSCs, RANKL is a potential target for prevention as well as treatment of breast cancer bone metastasis. ? 2018 by the authors.

Recently, the new endoscopic scraper Trefle? has been reported and demonstrated high cancer detectability in malignant biliary strictures. This device is used to scrape the stricture over the guidewire, and, in the original method, the tissue and/or cell samples obtained are subjected to histological and/or cytological analysis separately. However, discrimination of chunks of tissue is hampered by the opacity of the surrounding fluid. We have developed a cell block technique for the Trefle? device without dividing obtained specimens into tissue and cellular components, which is the simplest method and enables immunohistochemical analysis.

Spermatogenesis is a toxicological target of FNT under high-dose exposure. Although anti-androgenic action is postulated to be the mechanism associated with this toxicity, few studies have examined histopathology of androgen-dependent male accessory sex organs. The present study aimed to reveal the effects of FNT on the accessory organs of rats exhibiting spermatotoxicity in the absence of testicular histopathological changes. Furthermore, a possible novel molecular target was clarified. Male Wistar rats were orally administered 5 or 10 mg/kg FNT or its major metabolite 3-methyl-4-nitrophenol (MNP), or vehicle only, 4 days per week for 9 weeks. Then the epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicles were collected. FNT and MNP did not show anti-androgenic effects but FNT induced cytoplasmic vacuolation in the epithelial cells of epididymal ducts and hyperplasia of mucosal folds/epithelial papillomatosis in seminal vesicles. FNT and MNP induced epididymal phospholipidosis, which was presumably caused by inhibition of epididymal secreted phospholipase A2 (sPLA2). Percentages of morphologically normal sperm and immature sperm were significantly predicted from both epididymal sPLA2 and phospholipid levels and from epididymal sPLA2, respectively. These results suggest that epididymal phospholipidosis plays an important role in FNT-induced spermatotoxicity.

Short proteolytic products including macrophage-activating lipopeptide 2 (MALP2) have been utilized as antitumor immune-enhancing adjuvants. We have chemically synthesized a short form of MALP2 named MALP2s (S-[2,3-bis(palmitoyloxy)propyl]-CGNNDE). MALP2 and MALP2s provoke natural killer (NK) cell activation in vitro but only poorly induce tumor regression using in vivo mouse models loading NK-sensitive tumors. Here, we identified the functional mechanism of MALP2s on dendritic cell (DC)-priming and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-dependent tumor eradication using CTL-sensitive tumor-implant models EG7 and B16-OVA. Programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) blockade therapy in combination with MALP2s + ovalbumin (OVA) showed a significant additive effect on tumor growth suppression. MALP2s increased co-stimulators CD80/86 and CD40, which were totally MyD88-dependent, with no participation of toll-IL-1R homology domain-containing adaptor molecule-1 or type I interferon signaling in DC priming. MALP2s + OVA consequently augmented proliferation of OVA-specific CTLs in the spleen and at tumor sites. Chemokines and cytolytic factors were upregulated in the tumor. Strikingly, longer duration and reinvigoration of CTLs in spleen and tumors were accomplished by the addition of MALP2s + OVA to α-PD-L1 antibody (Ab) therapy compared to α-PD-L1 Ab monotherapy. Then, tumors regressed better in the MALP2s/OVA combination than in the α-PD-L1 Ab monotherapy. Hence, MALP2s/tumor-associated antigens combined with α-PD-L1 Ab is a good therapeutic strategy in some mouse models. Unfortunately, numerous patients are still resistant to PD-1/PD-L1 blockade, and good DC-priming adjuvants are desired. Cytokine toxicity by MALP2s remains to be settled, which should be improved by chemical modification in future studies. ? 2018 Takeda, Azuma, Funami, Shime, Matsumoto and Seya.",Antitumor adjuvant; Cross-presentation; Diacylated lipopeptide; Programmed death ligand-1 blockade; Toll-like receptor 2,B7 antigen; CD40 antigen; CD86 antigen; chemokine; interferon; interleukin 1 receptor; lipopeptide; macrophage activating lipopeptide 2; myeloid differentiation factor 88; ovalbumin; programmed death 1 ligand 1; programmed death 1 receptor; toll like receptor 2; tumor antigen; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bone marrow derived dendritic cell; cancer graft; cancer susceptibility; cell proliferation assay; chemical modification; controlled study; cross presentation; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; dendritic cell; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene expression; immunotherapy; male; mouse; Mycoplasma fermentans; natural killer cell; nonhuman; real time polymerase chain reaction; spleen tumor; T cell lymphoma; T lymphocyte activation; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumor volume; upregulation,2-s2.0-85043791584

To clarify intratubular crystal kinetics and processing in human kidneys, we performed a quantitative and morphological observation of nephrectomized renal parenchyma tissues. Methods: Clinical data and pathological samples from 60 patients who underwent radical nephrectomy for renal cancer were collected from June 2004 to June 2010. The patients were retrospectively classified as stone formers (SFs; n = 30, kidney stones detected by preoperative computed tomography) and non-stone formers (NSFs; n = 30, no kidney stone history). The morphology of parenchymal intratubular crystals and kidney stone-related gene and protein expression levels were examined in noncancerous renal sections from both groups. Results: SFs had a higher smoking rate (P = 0.0097); lower red blood cell, hemoglobin, and hematocrit values; and higher urinary red blood cell, white blood cell, and bacterial counts than NSFs. Scanning electron microscopy revealed calcium-containing crystal deposits and crystal attachment to the renal tubular lumen in both groups. Both groups demonstrated crystal transmigration from the tubular lumen to the interstitium. The crystal diffusion analysis indicated a significantly higher crystal existing ratio in the medulla and papilla of SFs and a significantly higher number of papillary crystal deposits in SFs than NSFs. The expression analysis indicated relatively high osteopontin and CD68, low superoxide dismutase, and significantly lower Tamm-Horsfall protein expression levels in SFs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis involving the above factors found the presence of renal papillary crystals as a significant independent factor related to SFs (odds ratio 5.55, 95% confidence interval 1.08-37.18, P = 0.0395). Conclusions: Regardless of stone formation, intratubular crystals in the renal parenchyma seem to transmigrate to the interstitium. SFs may have reduced ability to eliminate renal parenchymal crystals, particularly those in the papilla region, than NSFs with associated gene expression profiles. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Kidney stones; Macrophages; Osteopontin; Oxidative stress; Tamm-Horsfall protein,calcium; CD68 antigen; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; hemoglobin; osteopontin; superoxide dismutase; Tamm Horsfall glycoprotein; calcium oxalate; adult; Article; bacterial count; cancer surgery; CD68 gene; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; crystal structure; erythrocyte count; female; GAPDH gene; gene; gene expression; hematocrit; human; human cell; human tissue; independent variable; kidney cancer; kidney interstitium; kidney papilla; kidney parenchyma; kidney tubule; leukocyte count; major clinical study; male; middle aged; morphology; nephrolithiasis; preoperative evaluation; protein expression; quantitative analysis; renal protection; retrospective study; scanning electron microscopy; smoking; SOD1 gene; SPP1 gene; stone formation; UMOD gene; aged; comparative study; kidney medulla; metabolism; nephrectomy; nephrolithiasis; pathology; trends; Adult; Aged; Calcium Oxalate; Female; Humans; Kidney Calculi; Kidney Medulla; Male; Middle Aged; Nephrectomy; Retrospective Studies,2-s2.0-85043572394

Methods: Patients with asthma (without upper airway disease [UAD; n = 24], with rhinitis [n = 25], CRS [n = 24], and nasal polyps [n = 2]), isolated rhinitis (n = 13), isolated CRS (n = 13), and 10 healthy controls were prospectively recruited. Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (NO) levels at 50?mL/s (FeNO 50 ), nasal NO levels, Lund–Macay-scores of sinus computed tomography and an asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) were evaluated. Results: Asthma was associated with higher FeNO 50 levels irrespective of the UAD category. FeNO 50 levels were higher in asthmatics with CRS (median: 54.0 ppb) than those with rhinitis (35.2?ppb, p = 0.02) and those without UAD (34.3?ppb, p = 0.002). Nasal NO levels were higher in rhinitis patients than other UAD categories, irrespective of the asthma concomitance. Nasal NO levels were higher in asthmatics with rhinitis (112.8?ppb) than those without UAD (67.2?ppb, p = 0.001) and those with CRS (57.6?ppb, p &lt; 0.0001). A receiver-operating-characteristic curve analysis for detecting comorbid allergic rhinitis (AR) in asthmatics showed a high area under the curve (0.87). Nasal NO levels were positively correlated with FeNO 50 levels (ρ = 0.56, p = 0.003) in asthmatics with rhinitis. In contrast, they were negatively correlated with the Lund–Macay (ρ = ?0.46, p = 0.03) and ACQ scores (ρ = ?0.52, p = 0.009) in asthmatics with CRS. Conclusions: Higher nasal NO levels reflect the presence of AR, irrespective of asthma concomitance. Higher FeNO 50 levels reflect the presence of CRS and asthma. These NO measurements are useful for assessing comorbid UAD in asthmatics. ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Biomarkers; diagnostics; rhinitis/sinusitis,"corticosteroid; nitric oxide; nitric oxide; adolescent; adult; Article; asthma; atopy; chronic rhinosinusitis; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; female; forced expiratory flow; forced expiratory volume; forced vital capacity; fractional exhaled nitric oxide; human; male; middle aged; nose polyp; prospective study; respiratory tract disease; rhinitis; spirometry; upper respiratory tract; vasomotor rhinitis; young adult; aged; asthma; breath analysis; exhalation; lung function test; metabolism; nose; nose polyp; pathophysiology; receiver operating characteristic; rhinitis; sinusitis; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Asthma; Breath Tests; Exhalation; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nasal Polyps; Nitric Oxide; Nose; Respiratory Function Tests; Rhinitis; ROC Curve; Sinusitis; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85021052803

A four-year-old boy showed mild developmental delay with recurrent paroxysmal episodes of weakness and encephalopathy from nine months of age. Motor deficits, which included bilateral hypotonia, ataxia, dysmetria, limb incoordination, dysarthria, choreoathetosis, and dystonia, were observed from one year and three months.

Additionally, it has not been determined whether rotavirus (RV) vaccine could reduce cases of severe complications or not. Methods: A two-part questionnaire was designed to determine the number and clinical features of severe complications between 1 September 2008 and 31 August 2015, including the observation periods before and after RV vaccine introduction in Aichi Prefecture. Results: Twenty-four cases of encephalitis/encephalopathy, eight cases of sudden death, three cases of urinary tract stone, and three cases of GI bleeding were reported during the 2008/2009 season and the 2012/2013 seasons. Although five cases of encephalitis/encephalopathy were reported, no other cases of severe complications were reported during the 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 seasons. No age difference was noted according to type of complication. Although onset of encephalitis/encephalopathy and of sudden death was around day 2 of illness, that of urinary tract stone and GI bleeding was slightly later (day 6 and day 4). In addition to the eight sudden deaths, fatal outcome was also noted in four cases (13.8%) of encephalitis/encephalopathy, and in one case of GI bleeding.

However, the usefulness of FISH for differentiating between cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) and IgG4-related sclerosing cholangitis (IgG4-SC) has not been evaluated in forceps biopsy specimens. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 74 specimens obtained by transpapillary forceps biopsy between 2008 and 2015 from 49 consecutive patients with CCA and 25 with IgG4-SC. Specimens were considered positive for malignancy by FISH with UroVysion? if at least five cells exhibited polysomy (a gain of two or more in chromosomes 3, 7, or 17). Results: A total of 27 (55.1%) patients with CCA, but none of the patients with IgG4-SC, were positive for malignancy by FISH. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of FISH for the diagnosis of CCA were 55.1%, 100%, 100%, 53.2%, and 70.3%, respectively. The complementary use of FISH increased the sensitivity of hematoxylin-and-eosin (H&amp;E) staining from 69.4% to 77.6%; the specificity was not reduced when either H&amp;E or FISH was positive.

The aim of the current study was to investigate the patency and adverse events of duodenal and biliary stents in patients with DS. Methods: Patients who underwent DS from April 2004 to March 2017 were analyzed retrospectively with regard to clinical outcomes and predictive factors of recurrent biliary and duodenal obstruction (recurrent biliary obstruction [RBO] and recurrent duodenal obstruction [RDO]). Results: A total of 109 consecutive patients was enrolled. Technical success of DS was achieved in 108 patients (99.1%). Symptoms due to biliary and duodenal obstruction were improved in 89 patients (81.7%). RBO occurred in 25 patients (22.9%) and RDO in 13 (11.9%). The median times to RBO and RDO from DS were 87 and 76?days, respectively. Placement of a duodenal uncovered self-expandable metal stent (U-SEMS) was significantly associated with RBO in the multivariable analysis (P?=?0.007). Time to RBO was significantly longer in the duodenal covered self-expandable metal stent group than in the U-SEMS group (P?=?0.003). No predictive factors of RDO were detected, and duodenal stent type was not associated with the time to RDO (P?=?0.724). Conclusions: Double stenting was safe and effective for malignant bilioduodenal obstruction. Duodenal U-SEMS is a risk factor for RBO.

Fructose is contained in refreshing beverages as high-fructose corn syrup, and is associated with obesity. Fructose is absorbed via glucose transporter 5 (GLUT5) in the intestine. Therefore, the inhibition of GLUT5 is considered to be a target of obesity drugs. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of BTS extract and its constituents on fructose uptake using Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells, i.e., cells stably expressing GLUT5. Boiled water extract of BTS significantly suppressed GLUT5 function in a concentration-dependent manner without cytotoxicities. Among 18 components of BTS, the boiled water extracts of the rhizome of Zingiber officinale, the root and rhizome of Saposhnikovia divaricata, and the root of Platycodon grandiflorum exhibited significant inhibitory effects on fructose uptake with IC50 values of 314, 119 and 475??g/ml, respectively. Among the constituents of the rhizome of Z. officinale extract, 6-gingerol significantly inhibited GLUT5 with an IC50 value of 39??M, while 6-shogaol exhibited a significant but weak inhibition on GLUT5 at 100??M. One of the mechanisms of action of BTS may be the inhibition of fructose absorption in the intestine, and one of the active components of BTS is the rhizome of Z. officinale and 6-gingerol. ? 2018, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.",6-gingerol; Bofutsushosan; Fructose; Glucose transporter 5; Zingiber officinale,"(6) gingerol; aluminum silicate; Angelica root extract; Atractylodes japonica extract; bofutsushosan; calcium sulfate; Cnidium officinale extract; Ephedra sinica extract; Forsythia suspensa extract; fructose; Gardenia jasminoides extract; ginger extract; glucose transporter 5; Glycyrrhiza uralensis root; Mentha arvensis extract; Nepeta tenuifolia extract; plant extract; Platycodon grandiflorum extract; radix paeoniae; Rheum palmatum extract; Saposhnikovia divaricata extract; Scutellaria baicalensis extract; shogaol; silicon dioxide; sodium sulfate; unclassified drug; water; bofu-tsusho-san; glucose transporter 5; herbaceous agent; animal cell; Apiaceae; Article; Atractylodes; Atractylodes japonica; CHO-K1 cell line; Cnidium; Cnidium officinale; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug effect; drug identification; drug mechanism; drug targeting; enzyme inhibition; Forsythia suspensa; IC50; in vitro study; Mentha arvensis; Nepeta; Nepeta tenuifolia; nonhuman; plant root; protein expression; protein function; rhizome; rhubarb; Saposhnikovia divaricata; sugar transport; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; CHO cell line; Cricetulus; hamster; metabolism; transport at the cellular level; Animals; Biological Transport; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Cricetulus; Drugs, Chinese Herbal; Glucose Transporter Type 5; Rhizome",2-s2.0-85041547736

Differences in the management of antithrombotic agents for endoscopic procedures between Western and Eastern countries have already been reported. However, no study has investigated the differences among Asian countries. The aim of this study was to examine the differences in the etiology of gastrointestinal bleeding and management of antithrombotic agents during endoscopic procedures between Japan and other Asian countries (OAC). Methods: Questionnaires regarding gastrointestinal bleeding in clinical practice and management of antithrombotic agents during endoscopy were distributed to members of the International Gastroenterology Consensus Symposium Study Group. We analyzed the questionnaire answers and compared the results between Japan and OAC. Results: The cause of and treatment methods for gastrointestinal bleeding differed between Japan and OAC. In Japan, the trend was to continue drugs at the time of biopsy and endoscopic therapy. Even in cases of discontinuation, the drug withdrawal period was as short as <3 days. Thrombotic complications caused by the withdrawal of antithrombotic agents were observed more frequently in Japan (34.78%) than in OAC (22.46%; p = 0.016). Conclusion: Due to differences in guidelines and complications associated with discontinuation of drugs, the antithrombotic withdrawal period in Japan tended to be shorter than that in OAC. ? 2018 S.

We hereby present patient-reported quality of life (QOL) data obtained from this trial. Methods: Three self-administered QOL questionnaires (QOL-ACD, QOL-ACD-B, FACT-ES subscale) were used, and the difference in QOL score changes between the two groups was analyzed using a mixed-effects model for repeated measures. Results: Eligible patients (N?=?222) were randomly assigned to a 2-year (2YG, N?=?112) or 3-or-more-year treatment group (3YG, N?=?110). The time courses of the three QOL scores during the trial period were similar in the two groups. The mean changes in the QOL scores from week 96 were largely stable through week 240 in the 3YG, but showed significantly greater improvement in the score changes from week 96 in the 2YG than the 3YG.

This study aimed to investigate the optimal timing of treatment with one such agent, abiraterone acetate (AA), in Japanese patients. Materials and methods: Between July 2014 and February 2016, 106 CRPC patients were administered AA in Nagoya City University Hospital, Nagoya, Japan and in four affiliated hospitals following failure of primary combined androgen blockade (CAB). Of these, records of 69 patients treated before chemotherapy were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were divided into two AA treatment groups: (1) first- or second-line after diagnosis of CRPC, designated the Early Group, and (2) third-line onwards, designated the Deferred Group. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, ? 50% PSA decline rate with treatment, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) were compared between the two groups. National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0 was used to classify adverse events. Results: In 24 patients in the Early Group and 45 patients in the Deferred Group, no significant differences in baseline parameters were observed between groups. PSA response rate, ? 50% PSA decline rate and PFS (but not OS) were significantly better in the Early Group than in the Deferred Group. Serum aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase elevations were the most common Grade 3 treatment-related toxicities, and were clinically manageable. In subgroup analyses of the Early Group, comparison of first-line AA with second-line AA after flutamide treatment showed no changes in PSA response rate, PFS, or OS. Conclusion: This study suggests improved favorable outcomes of first- or second-line AA treatment in Japanese chemotherapy-na?ve CRPC patients after failed CAB; statistical confirmation of such improvement was evident for PFS, but not OS. In addition, early AA treatment exhibited an acceptable safety profile. ? 2017",abiraterone acetate; castration-resistant prostate cancer; combined androgen blockade,abiraterone acetate; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; flutamide; prostate specific antigen; acne; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cancer hormone therapy; cancer patient; castration resistant prostate cancer; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug treatment failure; early intervention; edema; glucose intolerance; heart palpitation; hot flush; human; hypertension; hypokalemia; Japanese (people); liver dysfunction; localized edema; major clinical study; male; nausea and vomiting; post treatment survival; priority journal; progression free survival; rash; retrospective study; side effect; thrombocytopenia; treatment response; very elderly,2-s2.0-85028364045

Therefore, we sought to explore active, naturally occurring compounds that promote the recovery of HMW adiponectin secretion suppressed by palmitic acid in our model. A total of 90 crude drug extracts were screened for the ability to augment HMW adiponectin secretion from 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with palmitic acid. Panaxynol was isolated from Saposhnikovia divaricata as an active compound with HMW adiponectin promoting properties. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonists are reported to increase the secretion of HMW adiponectin, although the effects of panaxynol were found to be independent of PPARγ activation. When the underlying mechanisms were further examined, panaxynol was found to inhibit the palmitic-acid-induced downregulation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) protein, and the anti-lipotoxic effects were abolished by a FoxO1 inhibitor. Furthermore, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein-α (C/EBPα) mRNA levels were also increased by panaxynol. Reactive oxygen species have critical roles in the reduction in HMW adiponection secretion by palmitic acid; however, panaxynol reduced this increase in reactive oxygen species generation, followed by reductions in markers of endoplasmic reticulum stress and inflammation. Taken together, these findings suggest that panaxynol ameliorates the impaired HMW adiponection secretion in adipocytes treated with palmitic acid by restoring FoxO1 expression, owing to inhibition of reactive oxygen species generation, in a PPARγ-independent manner. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Adipocyte; Adiponectin; Diabetes; Panaxynol; Saposhnikovia divaricata Schischk,adiponectin; cyclic AMP responsive element binding protein A; growth arrest and DNA damage inducible protein 153; messenger RNA; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; palmitic acid; panaxynol; reactive oxygen metabolite; rosiglitazone; transcription factor FKHR; tumor necrosis factor; adiponectin; alkyne derivative; fatty alcohol; palmitic acid derivative; panaxynol; reactive oxygen metabolite; transcription factor FKHR; 3T3-L1 cell line; animal cell; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; Article; controlled study; cytokine release; endoplasmic reticulum stress; human; human cell; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; animal; chemistry; cytology; drug effect; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; molecular weight; secretion (process); 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adiponectin; Animals; Diynes; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Fatty Alcohols; Forkhead Box Protein O1; HEK293 Cells; Humans; Mice; Molecular Weight; Palmitic Acids; Reactive Oxygen Species,2-s2.0-85038903908

The present study was designed to investigate the effect of central blood pressure (BP), which reflects cardiac load rather than peripheral BP, on serum concentrations of hs-cTnI in subjects with or without increased arterial stiffness. Methods: We enrolled 1210 participants taking part in a yearly health checkup program. Laboratory measurements included serum concentrations of hs-cTnI and derivative reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM), as well as plasma concentrations of B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP). Central BP and the radial augmentation index (rAI) were evaluated non-invasively using an automated device. Results: Univariate and multivariable regression analysis showed that both brachial and central BP were significantly associated with hs-cTnI. When subjects were divided into two groups according to the mean rAI value, those with higher rAI had higher hs-cTnI concentrations than those with lower rAI. In subgroup analyses, in those with lower rAI, brachial but not central systolic BP was independently associated with hs-cTnI, whereas in those with higher rAI, central but not brachial systolic BP was independently associated with hs-cTnI. These associations remained significant after further adjustment for BNP and/or d-ROM concentrations. Conclusions: Circulating levels of hs-cTnI increase with increasing brachial and central BP, but the effect of central BP was greater in subjects with higher rAI. This indicates that central BP may have a strong effect on silent myocardial damage, assessed as increased circulating hs-cTnI, particularly in subjects with increased arterial stiffness. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Arterial stiffness; Augmentation index; B-type natriuretic peptide; High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I; Oxidative stress,"angiotensin receptor antagonist; anticoagulant agent; antidiabetic agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; brain natriuretic peptide; calcium channel blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; reactive oxygen metabolite; troponin I; biological marker; troponin I; adult; arterial stiffness; Article; augmentation index; blood pressure; brachial blood pressure; central blood pressure; female; heart muscle injury; heart work; hormone blood level; human; laboratory; major clinical study; male; periodic medical examination; priority journal; protein blood level; radial augmentation index; aged; arterial stiffness; blood; brachial artery; comorbidity; comparative study; cross-sectional study; heart disease; Japan; middle aged; pathophysiology; population health; prognosis; risk factor; Aged; Biomarkers; Blood Pressure; Brachial Artery; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Heart Diseases; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Population Health; Prognosis; Reactive Oxygen Species; Risk Factors; Troponin I; Vascular Stiffness",2-s2.0-85042905576

The purpose of this study was to examine the utility of salutogenesis, which has sense of coherence at its core, for the self-management of patients with type 2 diabetes. A total of 258 questionnaires were distributed to patients who were seen at one of three hospitals in an urban area in Japan, after obtaining consent from the patient. They were between 20 and 75 years old and regularly received care. Of the 185 responses, 177 were valid. The responses were analyzed by referring to the framework of salutogenesis, and the relationship between patient characteristics, SOC, the Problem Areas In Diabetes survey (PAID), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were studied with structural equation modeling (SEM). SOC had a main effect on PAID scores and an indirect effect on HbA1c. Moreover, age influenced SOC positively. The SOC of patients with type 2 diabetes in the present study was comparatively high. These observations suggest a direct effect of SOC on reducing the sense of burden from having diabetes and an indirect effect on decreasing HbA1c. This research suggested the possibility that diabetes can be controlled by improving SOC. ? 2018 Nagoya University.",Salutogenesis; Self-management; Sense of coherence; Type 2 diabetes,"glycosylated hemoglobin; adult; aged; female; human; male; metabolism; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pathophysiology; physiology; self care; sense of coherence; young adult; Adult; Aged; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Self-Management; Sense of Coherence; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85042619435

However, PDA insulin secretion is transient and glucose unresponsive. Here, we report that an additional β cell developmental regulator, insulin gene enhancer binding protein splicing variant (Isl1β), improved insulin production and glucose-responsive secretion in PDA mice. Microarray gene expression analysis suggested that adenoviral PDA transfer required an additional element for mature β cell generation, such as Isl1 and Elf3 in the liver. In vitro promoter analysis indicated that splicing variant Isl1, or Isl1β, is an important factor for transcriptional activity of the insulin gene. In vivo bioluminescence monitoring using insulin promoter-luciferase transgenic mice verified that adenoviral PDA +Isl1β transfer produced highly intense luminescence from the liver, which peakedat day 7 and persisted for more than 10 days. Using insulin promoter-GFP transgenic mice, we further confirmed that Isl1β supplementation to PDA augmented insulin-producing cells in the liver, insulin production and secretion, and β cell-related genes. Finally, the PDA + Isl1β combination ameliorated hyperglycemia in diabetic mice for 28 days and enhanced glucose tolerance and responsiveness. Thus, our results suggest that Isl1β is a key additional transcriptional factor for advancing the generation of insulin-producing cells in the liver in combination with PDA.

We sought to compare the changes of serum lipid profiles caused by three regimens. Methods: A total of 216 CHC patients were enrolled. Among 170 patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 1b, 85 received daclatasvir plus asunaprevir (DCV/ASV) and 85 received sofosbuvir plus ledipasvir (SOF/LDV). Forty-six infected with HCV genotype 2 received sofosbuvir plus ribavirin (SOF/RBV). Serum total cholesterol (TC), LDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride were measured at baseline and 4, 8, 12 (for all regimens), and 24 weeks (for DCV/ASV) during treatment (4w, 8w, 12w, and 24w, respectively) and 12 and 24 weeks after treatment (p12w and p24w, respectively). Results: In 69 (81.2%) patients who received DCV/ASV and achieved a sustained virologic response at 24 weeks after the end of treatment (SVR24), TC and LDL-C increased significantly from baseline to p24w. In 84 (98.8%) treated with SOF/LDV who achieved SVR24, TC and LDL-C increased significantly from baseline to 8w, and TC decreased significantly from 8w to p12w. The 45 (97.8%) who received SOF/RBV and achieved SVR24 showed no significant changes. At 12w, TC and LDL-C increased to a greater degree in patients receiving SOF/LDV than in those receiving DCV/ASV or SOF/RBV. Conclusion: During treatment with DAAs, the serum lipid profile may reflect not only recovery from the disruption of lipid metabolism induced by HCV, but also the pharmacological effects of DAAs.

In Mendelian randomization studies, rare genetic mutations affecting LDL receptor function were found to cause higher or lower LDL-C levels, which are associated with correspondingly altered ASCVD risk. In prospective cohort studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of statins, a remarkably consistent log-linear association was demonstrated between the absolute magnitude of LDL-C exposure and ASCVD risk. The EAS Statement proposes that any mechanism of lowering plasma LDL concentration should reduce the risk of ASCVD events proportional to the absolute reduction in LDL-C and the cumulative duration of exposure to lower LDL-C. However, as we explain, we do not find this conclusion acceptable. Summary: Our review points out that different interpretations are possible for the results of Mendelian randomization studies. As for prospective cohort studies, many inconsistent reports on the association of LDL-C and ASCVD were disregarded when drafting the Statement, reports with and without genetic factors related to LDL receptor function should be analyzed separately, and the term ASCVD in the Statement is used inappropriately because myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction differ in their association with LDL-C. As for RCTs, clinical reports on statins published before and after the implementation of new regulations affecting clinical trials (2004/2005) should not both be included in meta-Analyses because the evaluated efficacy of statins changed markedly, and the irreversible adverse effects of statins need to be evaluated more rigorously now that their mechanisms have been elucidated. Key Messages: Apart from the EAS hypothesis that LDL causes ASCVD, recent pharmacological/biochemical studies, as summarized in this review and elsewhere, have revealed that atherosclerosis is caused by statins taken to lower LDL-C, as well as by warfarin and some types of vegetable fats and oils, in the absence of significantly elevated LDL-C levels. Thus, the promotion of statin treatment by the Statement is rather risky and we do not feel that the conclusions are justified for the prevention of ASCVD. ? 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was prospectively performed at onset and at 12 and 24 months old in 17 children with WS of unknown etiology. DTI was analyzed using tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) and tract-specific analysis (TSA) of 13 fiber tracts, and fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) were compared with those of 42 age-matched controls. Correlations of FA and MD with developmental quotient (DQ) at age 24 months were analyzed. Multiple comparisons were adjusted for using the false discovery rate (q-value). Results: TBSS analysis at onset showed higher FA and lower MD in the corpus callosum and brainstem in patients. TSA showed lower MD in bilateral uncinate fasciculi (UF) (right: q < 0.001; left: q = 0.03) at onset in patients. TBSS showed a negative correlation between FA at onset and DQ in the right frontal lobe, whereas FA at 24 months old exhibited a positive correlation with DQ in the diffuse white matter. MD for bilateral UF at 24 months old on TSA correlated positively with DQ (q = 0.04, both). Significance: These findings may indicate the existence of cytotoxic edema in the immature white matter and dorsal brainstem at onset, and subsequent alterations in the diffuse white matter in WS of unknown etiology. Microstructural development in the UF might play important roles in cognitive development in WS.

Interestingly, despite seemingly similar contralateral renal anatomy, a subset of cystinuric patients consistently form stones in only one kidney. The aim of this study is to evaluate clinical outcomes in unilateral vs bilateral cystine stone formers. Patients and Methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study of cystinuric patients evaluated and treated at the University of California, San Francisco between 1994 and 2015 and categorized patients as either unilateral or bilateral stone formers. Clinical presentation, baseline patient demographics, stone procedures, medical therapy regimens, and long-term renal function were compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 42 cystine stone patients (22 female, 20 male) were included in the analysis. The median age at first presentation was 18.5 years and median age at study conclusion was 45.5 years. Two-thirds of patients (n = 28) had a history of bilateral stones, whereas one-third (n = 14) had unilateral stones. Medical therapy regimens were similar between groups. Despite an increased average number of lifetime surgeries (7.5 sessions for bilateral vs 3.7 sessions for unilateral, p < 0.05), there was no significant difference in medians of the most recent glomerular filtration rate when compared with unilateral stone formers (81.5 vs 95 mL/min, respectively; p = 0.28). Conclusions: The majority of cystinuric patients within our cohort form stones bilaterally during their lifetime, and require more surgical interventions than unilateral stone formers. Despite this, overall renal function is well preserved in unilateral and bilateral cystinuric stone formers treated with minimally invasive stone extraction procedures. ?

However, the impact of subgenotype on treatment response is unknown. The aim of this study is to identify the effect of HBV subgenotype on treatment response. Methods: In this retrospective study, the derivation dataset comprised patients from the EFFORT study (NCT00962533) telbivudine monotherapy group; patients infected with genotypes B or C from the GLOBE (NCT00057265) and 015 (NCT00131742) studies formed the validation dataset. The HBV subgenotypes were determined using phylogenetic analysis based on the surface or overlapping polymerase gene. Molecular modeling was used to investigate relationships between positions of the substitutions within reverse transcriptase and genotypic resistance. Results: Of the patients in the derivation dataset, 110, 24, 162, and 1 patients were classified as having HBV subgenotypes B2, C1, C2, or other, respectively, compared to 222, 146, 282, and 51 in the validation dataset, respectively. Patients infected with subgenotype C1 showed a higher virologic response rate and hepatitis B envelope antigen seroconversion rate, and lower genotypic resistance rate than those infected with subgenotypes B2 and C2. Patients with genotypic resistance to telbivudine with subgenotype C1 showed fewer secondary mutations. The crystal structure model of reverse transcriptase showed that these secondary mutations were located around the YMDD motif, which possibly influenced the chance of mutations at rtM204. Conclusion: Hepatitis B virus subgenotype C1 is associated with better antiviral response to nucleoside analogs in hepatitis B envelope antigen-positive patients than B2 and C2 subgenotypes. The exact mechanism needs to be explored further. ? 2017 The Japan Society of Hepatology",viral hepatology,aspartic acid derivative; hepatitis B antigen; lamivudine; methionine derivative; RNA directed DNA polymerase; telbivudine; tyrosine derivative; tyrosylmethionylaspartylaspartic acid; unclassified drug; adult; Article; chronic hepatitis B; controlled study; crystal structure; female; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus genotype B; Hepatitis B virus genotype B1; Hepatitis B virus genotype C; Hepatitis B virus genotype C1; Hepatitis B virus genotype C2; human; major clinical study; male; molecular model; monotherapy; nonhuman; patient coding; phylogeny; priority journal; protein motif; retrospective study; seroconversion; structural gene; treatment response; virus envelope; virus mutation; virus resistance,2-s2.0-85020214220

Materials and Methods: We evaluated the intracranial physiological parameters, blood flow-related parameters, and brain morphology in the HDT (–6° and –12°) and the horizontal supine (HS) positions. Seven and 15 healthy subjects were scanned for each position using 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging system. The peak-to-peak intracranial volume change, the peak-to-peak cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure gradient (PG p-p ), and the intracranial compliance index were calculated from the blood and CSF flow determined using a cine phase-contrast technique. The brain volumetry was conducted using SPM12. The measurements were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test or a paired t-test. Results: No measurements changed in the –6° HDT. The PG p-p and venous outflow of the internal jugular veins (IJVs) in the –12° HDT were significantly increased compared to the HS (P &lt; 0.001 and P = 0.025, respectively). The cross-sectional areas of the IJVs were significantly larger (P &lt; 0.001), and the maximum, minimum, and mean blood flow velocity of the IJVs were significantly decreased (P = 0.003, &lt; 0.001, and = 0.001, respectively) in the –12° HDT. The mean blood flow velocities of the internal carotid arteries were decreased (P = 0.023). Neither position affected the brain volume. Conclusion: Pressure gradient and venous outflow were increased in accordance with the elevation of the intracranial pressure as an acute effect of the HDT. However, the CSF was not constantly shifted from the spinal canal to the cranium. Level of Evidence: 2. Technical Efficacy: Stage 1. J. Magn. Reson.

More than 75% of patients with anti-NMDAR encephalitis fully recover or have only mild sequelae, whereas the remainder experience severe disability. It remains unknown why certain cases have refractory clinical disease courses. We report a case of anti-NMDAR encephalitis with bilateral ovarian teratomas who was refractory to tumor resection and early initiation of immunotherapy. During intensive care, immunohistochemical analyses of her cere?brospinal fluid showed persistently high reactivity of NMDAR antibody over time. Six months after the operation, pelvic computed tomography detected a recurrent ovarian teratoma. After total enucleation of the bilateral ovaries, with significant pathological findings of bilateral mature cystic teratomas, her clinical condition improved rapidly, paralleled by a decrease in anti-NMDAR reactivity. This case illustrates the need to keep considering why extensive treatment fails to influence the disease when we encounter patients with refractory anti-NMDAR encephalitis.

This study aimed to investigate the association of circulating let-7a-5p levels with severity of hepatic fibrosis. Methods: We analyzed circulating let-7a-5p levels in serum and serum-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) in 84 Japanese CHC patients who underwent a liver biopsy by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and investigated the association of its levels with histological hepatic fibrotic stage, liver stiffness, and several hepatic fibrotic markers. Results: The levels of let-7a-5p in serum and EVs were significantly lower in patients with liver cirrhosis. Additionally, the serum let-7a-5p level correlated significantly with hepatic fibrotic markers, Mac-2 binding protein glycan isomer (M2BPGi), fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), and liver stiffness, evaluated by transient elastography. Furthermore, the serum let-7a-5p level was superior to M2BPGi, FIB-4, and APRI and was comparable to liver stiffness in discriminating liver cirrhosis. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that circulating let-7a-5p in serum may serve as a surrogate marker for severity of hepatic fibrosis in CHC. ?

Objective: The aim of this study was to determine a specific proprioceptive control strategy during postural balance in elderly patients with non-specific low back pain (NSLBP) and non-LBP (NLBP). Summary of Background Data: Proprioceptive decline is an important risk factor for decreased balance control in elderly patients with NSLBP. The resulting reduction in proprioception in the trunk or lower legs may contribute to a reduction in postural sway. This study aims to determine the specific proprioceptive control strategy used during postural balance in elderly patients with NSLBP and NLBP and to assess whether this strategy is related to proprioceptive decline in NSLBP. Methods: Pressure displacement centers were determined in 28 elderly patients with NSLBP and 46 elderly patients with NLBP during upright stances on a balance board without the benefit of vision. Gastrocnemius and lumbar multifidus muscle vibratory stimulations at 30, 60, and 240 Hz, respectively, were applied to evaluate the relative contributions of the different proprioceptive signals (relative proprioceptive weighting ratio, RPW) used in postural control. Results: Compared to elderly patients with NLBP, those with NSLBP had a lower RPW at 240Hz and significantly higher RPW at 30Hz. A logistic regression analysis showed that RPW at 240 Hz was independently associated with NSLBP after controlling for confounding factors. Conclusion: Elderly patients with NSLBP decreased their reliance on ankle strategy (RPW at 240 Hz) and hip strategy (RPW at 30Hz) proprioceptive signals during balance control. The inability to control hip and ankle strategies indicates a deficit of postural control and is hypothesized to result from proprioceptive impairment. Moreover, elderly patients with NSLBP are at higher risk for lower leg proprioceptive decrease (240 Hz) through the NSLBP exacerbation. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether breast cancer could be cured with modern sophisticated radiation techniques with good cosmetic outcome. We have treated 18 patients with operable breast cancer by conventional whole-breast irradiation followed by stereotactic body radiotherapy (primary tumor only) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (tumor plus axillary nodes) boost. The planned doses were 50 Gy in 25 fractions, 18 to 25.5 Gy in 3 fractions, and 20 Gy in 8 fractions, respectively, for the 3 modalities. Stereotactic body radiotherapy was delivered with 7 to 9 coplanar and noncoplanar fixed beams, and intensity-modulated radiotherapy was given by tomotherapy. Chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy was used depending on the stage and receptor status. In 9 recent patients, hydrogen peroxide was intratumorally injected twice a week before whole-breast irradiation. All treatments were well tolerable and there were no grade ?3 toxicities. With a median follow-up period of 35 months (range, 8-120 months), only 1 patient developed local recurrence and 2 patients developed distant metastasis. Overall survival, progression-free survival, and local control rates were 93%, 85%, and 92%, respectively, at 3 years. In 50% of the patients, the irradiated breast became better rounded, and the position of the nipple of the irradiated breast became ?1 cm higher compared to that of the unirradiated breast. Thus, the treated breasts may be more aesthetically favorable than before irradiation in these patients. This may become a treatment option for patients with operable breast cancer. ?

The mutant MYCN (MYCN-T58M) was non-phosphorylatable at Thr58 and subsequently accumulated in cells and appeared to induce CCND1 and CCND2 expression in neuronal progenitor and stem cells in vitro. Overexpression of Mycn mimicking the p.Thr58Met mutation also promoted neuronal cell proliferation, and affected neuronal cell migration during corticogenesis in mouse embryos. Conclusions: We identified a de novo c.173C>T mutation in MYCN which leads to stabilisation and accumulation of the MYCN protein, leading to prolonged CCND1 and CCND2 expression. This may promote neurogenesis in the developing cerebral cortex, leading to megalencephaly. While loss-of-function mutations in MYCN are known to cause Feingold syndrome, this is the first report of a germline gain-of-function mutation in MYCN identified in a patient with a novel megalencephaly syndrome similar to, but distinct from, CCND2-related megalencephaly-polymicrogyria-polydactyly-hydrocephalus syndrome. The data obtained here provide new insight into the critical role of MYCN in brain development, as well as the consequences of MYCN defects. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2018.

LS can be detected clinically by the whitish appearance of the glans or the foreskin, thickened, nonretractable foreskin, dysuria, and spraying. However, diagnosis is confirmed histopathologically. Purpose: The aim of this study was to investigate whether LS can be diagnosed on the basis of clinical manifestation and symptoms. Patients and methods: A retrospective analysis was performed, which included boys referred to our institutions for phimosis evaluation between May 2001 and December 2016. Pediatric urologists clinically diagnosed LS preoperatively. Boys with voiding problems, recurrent balanoposthitis, or who were unresponsive to topical steroid treatment underwent surgical treatment. Patients who underwent religious circumcisions were not included. Results: Three-hundred twenty boys diagnosed with phimosis were identified, and 71 (22%) boys underwent surgery. Fifty-eight boys underwent complete or partial circumcision, and 13 boys underwent a dorsal slit or preputioplasty. Thirty foreskin samples were sent for histopathologic examination. Histopathologic evaluation showed evidence of LS in 13 of 30 (43%) circumcised boys, chronic inflammation in ten (33%), no abnormality in four (13%), dysplasia in two (7%), and acute inflammation in one (3%). In the 22 boys who were clinically diagnosed with LS, 13 patients had histopathologic evidence of LS (59%). Visually, eleven cases had whitish foreskins and 21 cases had thickened nonretractable foreskins, of which there were seven (64%) (P>0.05) and 12 (57%) (P<0.01) cases, respectively. These cases were histopathologically diagnosed with LS. Both whitish and thickened, nonretractable foreskin was observed in eight patients, of which seven (88%) (P<0.01) were also histologically diagnosed with LS. There was no correlation between histopathologic diagnosis and preoperative symptoms such as dysuria, ballooning, spraying, or penile pain (P>0.2). Conclusion: It is difficult to reliably distinguish whether a patient has histopathological LS by clinical findings alone. ? 2018 Kato et al.",Balanitis xerotica obliterans; Child; Circumcision; Histology; Lichen sclerosus,adolescent; adult; Article; child; chronic inflammation; circumcision; diagnostic accuracy; dysplasia; dysuria; histopathology; human; human tissue; lichen sclerosus et atrophicus; major clinical study; male; micturition; observational study; penile pain; phimosis; preoperative evaluation; prepuce; preputioplasty; recurrent disease; retrospective study; urethra stenosis,2-s2.0-85057609568

Patients and methods: A total of 122 patients with mUC who were previously treated with platinum-based chemotherapy received second-line GD therapy from July 2010 to June 2016. This consisted of 800 mg/m2 gemcitabine and 40 mg/m2 docetaxel on days 1 and 8 in each 21-day cycle. Using pooled cumulative data, we divided patients into the following three groups based on age: &lt;65 years (Group A), from 65 to 74 years (Group B), and ?75 years (Group C), and then the data were retrospectively analyzed. All patients were evaluated for treatment-related toxicities and assessed at every cycle by imaging studies. Kaplan–Meier curves were used for survival and recurrence analyses. Furthermore, potential prognostic factors for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed via univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Results: The median follow-up period was 8.2 months (range: 2.1–100). The median number of treatment cycles was three (range: 1–16) in Group A, three (1–15) in Group B, and two (1–11) in Group C. The objective response rate was not significantly different between the three groups. In addition, PFS and OS from the start of second-line GD therapy were also not significantly different. According to univariate and multivariate analyses of the second-line GD-treated cohort, a good performance status was the only prognostic factor for PFS and OS. In Group C, myelosuppression including predominant neutropenia and anemia, fatigue, and nausea were the main common adverse events. However, the incidence of neutropenia and a reduction in platelets were not significantly different between the three groups. Treatment-related deaths did not occur in this study. Conclusion: In this study, GD combination therapy as a second-line treatment for mUC resulted in favorable tumor responses and few treatment-related toxicities, even among elderly patients. ? 2018 Naiki et al.",Elderly patients; Gemcitabine and docetaxel; Metastatic urothelial carcinoma; Second-line,carboplatin; cisplatin; dexamethasone; docetaxel; gemcitabine; aged; alopecia; anemia; area under the curve; Article; bone marrow suppression; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; constipation; continuous infusion; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; elderly care; fatigue; female; follow up; gastritis; human; hyperamylasemia; hypertransaminasemia; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; male; multiple cycle treatment; nausea; neutropenia; overall survival; progression free survival; rash; retrospective study; thrombocytopenia; transitional cell carcinoma; treatment outcome; visceral metastasis,2-s2.0-85057579829

In the present study, possible chemopreventive effect of FBRA against spontaneous occurrence of lymphomas was examined using female AKR/NSlc mice. Four-week-old female AKR/ NSlc mice were divided into three groups, and fed diets containing FBRA for 26 weeks at a dose level 0% (Group 1), 5% (Group 2) or 10% (Group 3). At the termination of experiment, the incidence of thymic malignant lymphoma of Group 3 was significantly lower than of Group 1 (p < 0.05). The average number of apoptotic cells of the thymic lymphoma of Group 3 was significantly larger than that of Group 1 (p < 0.05). In addition, the incidences of malignant lymphoma arising from body surface and abdominal lymph nodes, and the frequencies of lymphoma cell invasion to liver, kidney, spleen, and ovary of Group 3 were relatively lower than those of Group 1. These results indicate that FBRA inhibits spontaneous development of the lymphoma in female AKR/NSc mice and the inhibition of lymphomagenesis may relate to the induction of apoptosis by exposure of FBRA, suggesting that FBRA could be a protective agent against development of human lymphoma. ? 2018 Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.",Chemoprevention-Mice; Fermented brown rice and rice bran; Spontaneous malignant lymphoma,"AKR mouse; animal; animal food; chemistry; female; fermentation; lymphoma; mouse; Oryza; pathology; physiology; phytotherapy; thymoma; Animal Feed; Animals; Female; Fermentation; Lymphoma; Mice; Mice, Inbred AKR; Oryza; Phytotherapy; Thymus Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85057269457

Here we report polyamine-based inhibitors of LSD1 and LSD2. In the initial screening, partially constrained polyamine 2 which contains three trans-cyclopentane units with a total of six stereogenic centers, showed the most potent LSD1-inhibitory activity. We then prepared a set of optical isomers of 2 and evaluated their inhibitory activities toward LSD1, LSD2, monoamine oxidases A and B (MAO-A and MAO-B). Optical isomers of 2 showed LSD1-inhibitory activity with Ki values of 2.2 to 6.4 μM, and LSD2-inhibitory activity with Ki values of 4.4 to 39 μM; there was a general preference for LSD1 to LSD2. All of them showed weak to negligible inhibition of MAO-A and MAO-B. This selectivity seemed to reflect the differences in the size and shape of the catalytic cavity of target enzymes, and our strategy of employing a set of optical isomers appears to be an effective approach for exploring the structural features of this family of enzymes. Polyamine 9 showed most potent LSD1-inhibitory activity (Ki = 2.2 μM in vitro), and it also inhibited the proliferation of HL-60 cells (IC50 = 49 μM).

However, the factors that determine the magnitude of HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses are poorly understood. To examine the impact of genetic variations of HBV on HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses, we introduced three HBV clones (Aa_IND [Aa], C_JPN22 [C22], and D_IND60 [D60]) that express various amounts of HBV antigens into the livers of C57BL/6 (B6) (H-2b) mice and B10.D2 (H-2d) mice. In B6 mice, clone C22 barely induced HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses and persisted the longest, while clone D60 elicited strong HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses and was rapidly cleared. These differences between HBV clones largely diminished in H-2d mice. Interestingly, the magnitude of HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses in B6 mice was associated with the HB core antigen expression level during the early phase of HBV transduction. Surprisingly, robust HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses to clone C22 were induced in interferon-/ receptor-deficient (IFN-R -/- ) (H-2b) mice. The induction of HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses to C22 in IFN-R -/- mice reflects enhanced HBV antigen expression because the suppression of antigen expression by HBV-specific small interfering RNA (siRNA) attenuated HBV-specific T cell responses in IFN-R -/- mice and prolonged HBV expression. Collectively, these results suggest that HBV genetic variation and type I interferon signaling determine the magnitude of HBV-specific CD8 T cell responses by regulating the initial antigen expression levels.

In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the outcomes of a subset of patients with stage I small-cell lung cancer treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy in the database of the Japanese Radiological Society-Multi-Institutional stereotactic body radiotherapy Study Group. The 43 patients treated with stereotactic body radiotherapy for stage I small-cell lung cancer between 2004 and 2012 at 11 Japanese institutions were studied: median age = 77 years; 32 (74%) males and 11 females; and 80% were medically inoperable. The clinical stage was IA in 31 and IB in 12. In all patients, the lung tumors were pathologically proven as small-cell lung cancer. A total dose of 48 to 60 Gy was administered in 4 to 8 fractions. The median biologically effective dose (α/β = 10 Gy) was 105.6 Gy. Chemotherapy and prophylactic cranial irradiation were administered in only 8 patients, respectively. The median follow-up time was 23.2 months. The 2-year overall survival, progression-free survival, and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 72.3%, 44.6%, and 47.2%, respectively. The 2-year local control was 80.2%. Regarding the patterns of failure, distant metastasis, lymph node metastasis, and local recurrence were observed in 47%, 28%, and 16% of patients, respectively. No ?grade 3 stereotactic body radiotherapy-related toxicities were observed. Although stereotactic body radiotherapy was thus revealed to be effective for the local control of stage I small-cell lung cancer, the incidence of distant metastases was high. Further investigations of larger cohorts are needed, including analyses of the effects of combined chemotherapy. ?

We investigated the clinical features and outcomes of PRCA associated with thymoma in this study. Methods: A retrospective review of all PRCA patients who underwent surgical resection of thymoma from April 1, 2004, to December 31, 2015, was performed. Results: We experienced eight patients with PRCA among 146 patients who underwent surgical resection of thymoma. Extended thymectomy (n=4) and thymectomy (n=4) were performed for thymoma. Regarding the WHO classification of thymoma, the subtypes were type B2 or B3 in seven patients, and the stage of thymoma was advanced in seven patients. Complete resection was achieved macroscopically in only five patients. Recurrence of thymoma occurred in four patients who underwent complete resection. PRCA was diagnosed after surgical resection of thymoma in six patients (range 1–101 months, median 56.5 months). Cyclosporine was used for PRCA in six patients. Pneumonia of treatment-related complications due to cyclosporine occurred in all patients. The follow-up period ranged from 13–147 months (median 54.5 months) after the PRCA diagnosis. Three patients obtained complete remission of anemia by cyclosporine. Although one patient was able to stop taking cyclosporine because of complete remission of anemia, transfusion was needed due to relapse of PRCA. Five patients died, with the main causes of death diagnosed as pneumonia (n=4) and cardiac failure (n=1). Conclusions: PRCA associated with thymoma was diagnosed postoperatively in three-quarter of patients. We should be alert for the occurrence of PRCA even after resection of thymoma, especially in patients with incomplete resection or advanced disease. Cyclosporine was effective for PRCA, but treatment-related complications occurred, particularly pneumonia. As treatment for PRCA associated with thymoma and its complications were combined in a complex manner, treating PRCA associated with thymoma can be quite difficult. ? Journal of Thoracic Disease.

To report the impact of baseline central retinal thickness (CRT) on outcomes in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) in VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME. Methods. Post hoc analyses of two randomized controlled trials in which 862 DME patients were randomized 1 : 1 : 1 to treatment with intravitreal aflibercept 2.0 mg every 4 weeks (2q4), intravitreal aflibercept 2.0 mg every 8 weeks after five initial monthly doses (2q8), or macular laser photocoagulation at baseline and as needed. We compared visual and anatomical outcomes in subgroups of patients with baseline CRT < 400 μm and =400 μm. Results. At weeks 52 and 100, outcomes with intravitreal aflibercept 2q4 and 2q8 were superior to those in laser control-treated patients regardless of baseline CRT. When looked at in a binary fashion, the treatment effect of intravitreal aflibercept versus laser was not significantly better in the ?400 μm than the <400 μm group; when looked at as a continuous variable, baseline CRT seemed to have an impact on the treatment effect of intravitreal aflibercept versus laser. Conclusions. Post hoc analyses of VIVID-DME and VISTA-DME demonstrated the benefits of intravitreal aflibercept treatment in DME patients with baseline CRT < 400 μm and ?400 μm.

Material and methods: A retrospective multicentre study was conducted involving 71 patients with spontaneous rupture of HCC. A conservative treatment group (Cons T group) included 20 patients, while a transcatheter arterial embolisation group (TAE group) included 51 patients. Results: The median survival time (MST) in the Cons T group was only 16 days and the survival rate was 39% at one month, whereas the MST in the TAE group was 28 days and the one month survival rate was 63%. However, there is no statistically significant difference in the overall survival between Cons T and TAE groups (p = 0.213). Multivariable analysis identified only the presence of distant metastasis as an independent prognostic factor (p = 0.023). A subanalysis including patients without distant metastasis showed that the presence of portal vein tumour thrombosis was a significant prognostic factor (p = 0.015). Conclusions: Distant metastasis appears to be a prognostic factor in spontaneous rupture of HCC. In cases without distant metastasis, portal vein tumour thrombosis could influence the prognosis. Our data failed to prove any benefit of TAE as the primary management. ?

In Japan, the number of patients taking Japanese traditional Kampo medicines has been increasing, and the proper drug information about herb-drug interaction is highly demanded. The most established herb-drug interaction is the case of grapefruit juice (GFJ) via the inhibition on CYP3A4 expressed in the small intestine. In the present study, we compared the inhibitory titer on CYP3A4 between the target Kampo products and GFJ used as positive control. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of GFJ and three extracts of Kampo formulas frequently used in gynecological clinics on CYP3A4 in vitro and calculated the related titer of one-time dosage of Kampo formulas to GFJ in order to predict its effect on clinics. Although the extracts of these three Kampo formulas and the most of crude drug components in the formulas exhibited the inhibitory effects on CYP3A4 in some levels, the possibilities of tokishakuyakusan and keishibukuryogan to cause drug interaction can be quite low; however, it is possible that the excessive dosage of kamishoyosan may cause drug interaction with the substrate of CYP3A4 in clinics. ? 2018 Hao Ni et al.",,cytochrome P450 3A4; kamishoyosan; Kampo medicine (drug); keishi bukuryo gan; tokishakuyaku san; unclassified drug; animal cell; Article; concentration response; controlled study; drug effect; drug information; drug screening; enzyme inhibition; grapefruit juice; gynecology; herb drug interaction; herbal medicine; human; human cell; IC50; in vitro study; Kampo medicine; microsome; nonhuman; protein expression; rat,2-s2.0-85055490072

AF causes a loss in atrial contractile function that favors the formation of thrombi, and thus increases the risk of stroke. Also, AF produces highly irregular and complex temporal dynamics in ventricular response RR intervals. Thus, it is hypothesized that the analysis of RR dynamics could provide predictors for IS. However, these complex and nonlinear dynamics call for the use of advanced multiscale nonlinear signal processing tools. Objectives: The global aim is to investigate the performance of a recently-proposed multiscale and nonlinear signal processing tool, the scattering transform, in predicting IS for patients suffering from AF. Methods: The heart rate of a cohort of 173 patients from Fujita Health University Hospital in Japan was analyzed with the scattering transform. First, p-values of Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to identify scattering coefficients achieving significant (univariate) discrimination between patients with and without IS. Second, a multivariate procedure for feature selection and classification, the Sparse Support Vector Machine (S-SVM), was applied to predict IS. Results: Groups of scattering coefficients, located at several time-scales, were identified as significantly higher (p-value < 0.05) in patients who developed IS than in those who did not. Though the overall predictive power of these indices remained moderate (around 60 %), it was found to be much higher when analysis was restricted to patients not taking antithrombotic treatment (around 80 %). Further, S-SVM showed that multivariate classification improves IS prediction, and also indicated that coefficients involved in classification differ for patients with and without antithrombotic treatment. Conclusions: Scattering coefficients were found to play a significant role in predicting IS, notably for patients not receiving antithrombotic treatment. S-SVM improves IS detection performance and also provides insight on which features are important. Notably, it shows that AF patients not taking antithrombotic treatment are characterized by a slow modulation of RR dynamics in the ULF range and a faster modulation in the HF range. These modulations are significantly decreased in patients with IS, and hence have a good discriminant ability. ? 2018 Schattauer.",Atrial fibrillation; Heart rate variability; Ischemic stroke; Nonlinear multiscale analysis; Scattering transform; Wavelet transform,area under the curve; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; complication; heart rate; human; machine learning; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; physiology; support vector machine; Area Under Curve; Atrial Fibrillation; Heart Rate; Humans; Machine Learning; Multivariate Analysis; Stroke; Support Vector Machine,2-s2.0-85055148039

Some chemicals can pose risks to human reproduction that is a multistage process starting from the development of male and female germ cells to childbirth and the subsequent growth and development of the child. In Japan, the government has amended law enforcement, i.e., the Regulations on Labor Standards for Women, recently to improve protection for pregnant women against reproductive chemical hazards in workplaces. Male workers may also be protected against such hazards if appropriate risk assessment and the following management are performed as required by the Industrial Safety and Health Law. However, it remains a concern that an unexpected adverse outcome due to an unknown reproduction hazard may occur owing to the use of chemicals not listed in the regulations. This is because the toxicity of a large number of chemicals has not been entirely revealed. Moreover, it is often difficult to determine from a Safety Data Sheet for a product of interest whether the chemicals contained in the product do not have reproductive toxicity or the toxicity data are just not available because of lack of pertinent studies. Thus, researchers in the field of occupational and environmental health need to make effort to fill in such data gaps and to raise the awareness among the public the importance of experimental and epidemiological studies. Study designs for investigating subclinical effects, mechanisms of reproductive toxicity, exposure levels, and dose-response relationships to determine environmental standards are also required.",chemicals; regulation; reproductive toxicity; research; workplace,birth rate; child; dangerous goods; ecotoxicology; female; human; legislation and jurisprudence; male; occupational exposure; occupational health; population dynamics; pregnancy; prevention and control; reproductive health; risk assessment; risk management; statistics and numerical data; trends; workplace; Birth Rate; Child; Ecotoxicology; Female; Hazardous Substances; Humans; Male; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Health; Population Dynamics; Pregnancy; Reproductive Health; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Workplace,2-s2.0-85054894152

However, no evaluation system is currently available for precise and comprehensive analysis of intestinal pharmacokinetics. To address this, functional intestinal epithelial cells were generated from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells for use in pharmacokinetic studies. An improved intestinal differentiation method was established by screening a variety of small molecule compounds against cells during differentiation. The mRNA expression levels of intestinal markers, drug transporters, and CYP3A4 were found to increase following treatment with compounds that act as inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinase, DNA methyltransferase, and transforming growth factor-β. Therefore, we inferred that these compounds enhanced differentiation into intestinal epithelial cells. The differentiated intestinal epithelial cells in the presence of these compounds possessed drug-metabolizing enzyme activities, such as those of CYPs, UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, and sulfotransferase. In addition, these cells had the ability to induce CYP3A4 in the presence of 1a,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 . The differentiated intestinal epithelial cells seeded on cell culture inserts formed loose-tight junctions, similar to those in the human small intestine, rather than Caco-2 cells. The cells exhibited polarity, such as apical and basal sides. We also demonstrated that the uptake and effiux transport activities in the cells occurred via peptide transporter and breast cancer resistance protein, respectively. Taken together, it was suggested that human iPS cell-derived intestinal epithelial cells are pharmacokinetically functional, and represent a promising model system for pharmacokinetic studies of drug candidates. ? 2018, Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.

Design: A structured and scenario-based survey of physicians who managed ICU patients from May 2012 to December 2012. Setting: ICUs in China, Korea, and Japan. Subjects: Specialists who are either intensivists or nonintensivist primary attending physicians in charge of patients (195 in China, 186 in Korea, 224 in Japan). Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Country was independently associated with differences in the practice of limiting multiple forms of life-sustaining treatments on multivariable generalized linear model analysis. Chinese respondents were least likely to apply do-not-resuscitate orders, even if they existed (p < 0.001). Japanese respondents were most likely to practice do not resuscitate for terminally ill patients during cardiac arrest, even when no such prior order existed (p < 0.001). Korean respondents' attitudes were in between those of Chinese and Japanese respondents as far as withdrawing total parenteral nutrition, antibiotics, dialysis, and suctioning was concerned. Chinese respondents were most uncomfortable discussing end-of-life care issues with patients, while Japanese respondents were least uncomfortable (p < 0.001). Chinese respondents were more likely to consider financial burden when deciding on limiting life-sustaining treatment (p < 0.001). Japanese respondents felt least exposed to personal legal risks when limiting life-sustaining treatment (p < 0.001), and the Korean respondents most wanted legislation to guide this issue (p < 0.001). The respondents' gender, religion, clinical experience, and primary specialty were also independently associated with the different perceptions of end-of-life care. Conclusions: Despite similarities in cultures and a common emphasis on the role of family, differences exist in physician perceptions and practices of end-of-life ICU care in China, Korea, and Japan. These findings may be due to differences in the degree of Westernization, national healthcare systems, economic status, and legal climate. ? 2018 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In Japan, FT1DM accounts for approximately 20% of acute-onset adult type 1 diabetes mellitus cases; however, reports of pediatric-onset FT1DM are rare. We aimed to determine the frequency and clinical characteristics of FT1DM in Japanese children and adolescents by conducting a 2-phase questionnaire survey among the members of the Japanese Study Group of Insulin Therapy for Childhood and Adolescent Diabetes (JSGIT) regarding their clinical experience with FT1DM. Responses were obtained from 54 of the 79 participating hospitals (68.4%). Of these, 8 hospitals managed a total of 15 pediatric patients with FT1DM (4 patients in each of 2 hospitals, 2 patients in 1 hospital, and 1 patient in each of 5 hospitals). The distribution of patient age was biphasic, with peaks in children younger than 5 years and older than 8 years of age. The clinical characteristics of FT1DM in this population (such as the duration from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, severity of symptoms, preceding flu-like episodes, and abnormal laboratory data) did not differ from those of patients with adult-onset FT1DM. The frequency of pediatric-onset FT1DM is low compared with that of adult-onset FT1DM.

An ideal way to achieve this is by implementing Advance directive (Ad) and Advance Care Planning (ACP), which do not usually include postmortem events. This study aims to create opportunities for Ad and ACP to include the postmortem period as a trigger for this awareness reform. Methods: We conducted an Ad/ACP enlightenment lecture, and a questionnaire survey pre- and post-lecture for the elderly in old New Town, which is known for its aging society. The questionnaire comprised 38 multiple-choice questions covering 6 themes assuming an advanced state of dementia. Results: There were 35 participants (7 men and 22 women) aged 40-89 years. Several people left during the lecture, making it difficult to capture the precise transformation effect with regard to changing of mind. However, the effect of enlightenment was identified as a result of the consciousness survey. A statistically significant change in consciousness occurred in response to social contribution after death. Furthermore, notably more people wanted emergency transportation compared to those wanting resuscitation and extension of life. Conclusions: The medical treatment desired might vary over time. Even the desire for life extension may differ significantly among individuals. This survey indicated a divergent view between the general public and medical staff, regarding a series of medical actions. We must persistently promote opportunities for enlightenment in cooperation with the general public (i.e., the communities and families we serve). ? 2018, Japan Geriatrics Society.

Since the patients’ exposure levels have not been fully clarified, this study estimated end-of-shift urinary concentrations of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and their lower limit below which the disease occurrence was rare. TCA concentration was measured in 78 TCE HS patients whose urine was collected at admission between 2nd and 14th d after their last shift. Then a linear regression model was used to calculate the mean TCA concentration with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and 95% prediction interval (95% PI) in the end-of-shift urine. The estimated mean concentration was 83 (95% CI, 49–140) mg/l with 95% PI 9.6–720 mg/l. TCA concentrations were also measured in the end-of-shift urine of 38 healthy workers involved in the same job as were the patients. The geometric mean and its 95% CI were 127 mg/l and 16–984 mg/l, respectively. The exposure levels in HS patients might have thus overlapped with those in workers without HS. Accordingly, it was suggested that HS occurred in the environment where the workers were exposed to the TCE concentration corresponding to the urinary TCA concentration as low as 10 mg/l. ?2018 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.",Hypersensitivity syndrome; Occupational exposure; Prediction interval; Trichloroacetic acid; Trichloroethylene; Urine,trichloroacetic acid; trichloroethylene; adolescent; adult; analysis; chemically induced; China; complication; epidemiology; female; hepatitis; human; hypersensitivity; male; occupational disease; occupational exposure; skin disease; urine; Adolescent; Adult; China; Female; Hepatitis; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Male; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Skin Diseases; Trichloroacetic Acid; Trichloroethylene,2-s2.0-85050822061

Generally, the contents of the hernia pass through the foramen of Winslow from right to left. The case presented in this report is very unusual, as the small intestine in the hernia passed through the foramen from left to right. Presentation of case: A 67-year-old woman developed a sudden abdominal pain 15 days after laparoscopic subtotal colectomy. Abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) examination revealed a FWH, and an emergency surgery was scheduled. The small intestine was found to be herniating from the cavity of the omental bursa through the foramen of Winslow, to the right side of the hepatoduodenal ligament, and was incarcerated. The incarcerated intestine was reduced, and the necrotic part of the intestine was resected. In addition, the foramen of Winslow and the cavity of omental bursa were closed to prevent relapse. Conclusion: To our knowledge, here we report the first FWH of which the contents of the hernia are herniated from left to right, in literature. Whether the Foramen should be closed or not requires discussion, however, we conclude that the foramen should be closed when possible, acknowledging previous reports and the present case. ? 2018 The Authors",Foramen of Winslow hernia; Internal hernia; Status post total colectomy,prednisolone; abdominal pain; aged; Article; case report; clinical article; colon resection; computer assisted tomography; contrast enhancement; emergency surgery; end to end anastomosis; female; foramen of winslow hernia; hernia incarceration; human; ileostomy; internal hernia; intestine necrosis; laparoscopic surgery; laparotomy; omentum; priority journal; rare disease; small intestine disease; treatment outcome; ulcerative colitis,2-s2.0-85049945376

Methods: In 2010, we established a cohort study of 2417 adults (age 20-91 yr) from 300 randomly selected areas across Japan who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Survey of Japan. We cross-sectionally examined an association between SES and (1) prevalence of hypercholesterolemia in 2417 participants (999 men and 1418 women) and (2) not receiving medication for hypercholesterolemia in 654 participants (215 men and 439 women). SES included employment status, marital status, length of education, and household expenditures. Hypercholesterolemia was defined as a total serum cholesterol level of ? 6.21 mmol/L (240 mg/dL) or the use of lipid-lowering medications. Results: The overall prevalence of hypercholesterolemia was 21.5% in men and 31.0% in women. In men, the lowest quintile of household expenditures was associated with a higher prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (28.3%) compared with the upper 4 quintiles (19.9%) (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-2.38). Among participants with hypercholesterolemia, 55.4% of men and 55.1% of women were not receiving medication. Unmarried men were more likely to be untreated (75.0%) than married men (50.9%) (multivariable-adjusted odds ratio 2.53; 95%CI 1.05-6.08). SES had no significant effects in women. Conclusion: In a general population of Japanese men, low household expenditures were associated with a higher prevalence of hypercholesterolemia, and unmarried men with hypercholesterolemia were less likely to receive medication. ? 2018 Japan Atherosclerosis Society.",Hypercholesterolemia; Japan; Risk factor; Socioeconomic status; Treatment,"hemoglobin A1c; adult; Article; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; disease association; education; electrocardiography; employment; enzyme assay; female; household income; human; hypercholesterolemia; major clinical study; male; marriage; middle aged; prevalence; prospective study; questionnaire; risk factor; social status; urinalysis; aged; health survey; hypercholesterolemia; Japan; lipid metabolism; menopause; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; social class; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Hypercholesterolemia; Japan; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Menopause; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Social Class; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85049579052

We conducted a nationwide epidemiologic survey of symptomatic vitamin D deficiency to observe its incidence rate among Japanese children. A questionnaire inquiring the number of new patients with vitamin D deficiency rickets and/or hypocalcemia for 3 years was sent to 855 randomly selected hospitals with a pediatrics department in Japan. In this survey, we found that 250 children were diagnosed with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency. The estimated number of patients with symptomatic vitamin D deficiency per year was 183 (95% confidence interval (CI): 145–222). The overall annual incidence rate among children under 15 years of age was 1.1 per 100,000 population (95% CI: 0.9–1.4).

Results A total of 135 patients were randomized to the pyridoxine (n = 67) or no pyridoxine (n = 68) groups. Grade 2 or worse HFS developed in 19 of 66 patients (28.8%) versus 21 of 67 patients (31.3%) in the pyridoxine and no pyridoxine groups, respectively. The median time to onset of grade 2 or worse HFS was 13.6 and 10.6 months in the pyridoxine and no pyridoxine groups, respectively [hazard ratio = 0.75 (80% confidence interval 0.50-1.13), one-sided P = 0.18]. Conclusions Prophylactic pyridoxine was not shown to have an effect on the onset of capecitabine-associated HFS in this study. ?

To overcome this, we investigated alternative molecular markers for detection of prostatic carcinogens in a short period in rats. After treatment with 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), expression of high-mobility group protein B2 (HMGB2) was up-regulated in rat ventral prostate. To evaluate the applicability of HMGB2 in the early detection of carcinogenicity of chemicals using animal models, we examined HMGB2 expression in prostate of rats. Six-week-old male F344 rats were gavaged for four weeks with a total of eight individual chemicals, divided into two categories based on prostate carcinogenicity. Animals were sacrificed at the end of the study and HMGB2 immunohistochemistry was performed. HMGB2 expression in least one prostate lobe was significantly increased by all four prostate carcinogens compared with the controls. In contrast, the four chemicals that were not carcinogenic in the prostate did not cause HMGB2 up-regulation. Additionally, high HMGB2 expression in neoplastic lesions in both rat and human was detected. Therefore HMGB2 expression may be a good screening tool for the identification of potential of prostate carcinogens. ? 2018, Japanese Society of Toxicology.

Its capsule and exotoxins can cause upper respiratory tract infections such as sinusitis. The general treatment for S. pyogenes-induced sinusitis is administration of antibiotics such as penicillin and macrolides; however, a serious problem associated with these antibiotics is their attenuated effect. Shin'iseihaito (Xinyiqingfeitang), a formula of Japanese traditional Kampo medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, has been used for the treatment of sinusitis. In general, formulas of Japanese traditional Kampo medicine are orally administered. This is in contrast to certain formulas of traditional Chinese medicine, which are being recently administered intramuscularly or intravenously. Regarding these traditional Chinese medicine formulas, the injection methodology is reported to be more effective than oral intake. In this study, we compared the efficacy between orally and intramuscularly administered Shin'iseihaito against S. pyogenes-induced sinusitis. We evaluated the antibacterial effect of Shin'iseihaito extract (SSHT) against S. pyogenes by K-B disk diffusion assay. Furthermore, we investigated the nasal colonization of S. pyogenes, determined cytokine (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6) levels, and conducted a splenocyte proliferative assay in a murine sinusitis model. SSHT displayed direct anti-S. pyogenes activity. Intramuscular administration of SSHT decreased the nasal colonization of S. pyogenes compared with oral administration. Thymidine uptake analysis revealed that the proliferation of splenocytes from S. pyogenes-infected mice under intramuscular SSHT treatment was upregulated compared to that of splenocytes from S. pyogenes-infected mice under oral SSHT treatment. We also found that TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels in the nasal discharge from intramuscularly treated S. pyogenes-infected mice were lower than those from orally treated mice. Our findings suggest that intramuscular administration of Shin'iseihaito may be useful for the treatment of murine S. pyogenes-induced sinusitis. ? 2018 Masaaki Minami et al.",,antibiotic agent; Chinese drug; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; Kampo medicine (drug); penicillin G; shin'iseihaito; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; Anemarrhena asphodeloides; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterial colonization; bacterial sinusitis; Chinese medicine; Cimicifuga heracleifolia; controlled study; disk diffusion; Gardenia jasminoides; group A streptococcal infection; Gypsum fibrosum; human; Kampo medicine; Lilium lancifolium; loquat; Magnolia salicifolia; medicinal plant; mouse; nasal lavage; nonhuman; Ophiopogon japonicas; protein expression; Scutellaria baicalensis; spleen cell,2-s2.0-85048161044

Objective: The aim of this study was to create a simple screening test for patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) by focusing on non-amnestic symptoms. Methods: Age-matched healthy controls (age 75.3±6.8), patients with MCI (76.5±5.5), and AD (78.2±5.0) participated in this study. They carried out mental rotation tasks targeting geometric graphics or alphabetical characters with three rotating angles (0°, 90°, and 180°) and indicated the correct answer. Response accuracy and reaction time were recorded along with their eye movements using an eye tracker. To quantify their visual processing strategy, the run count ratio (RC ratio) was calculated by dividing the mean number of fixations in incorrect answers by that in correct answers. Results: AD patients showed lower accuracy and longer reaction time than controls. They also showed a significantly greater number of fixation and smaller saccade amplitude than controls, while fixation duration did not differ significantly. The RC ratio was higher for AD, followed by MCI and control groups. By setting the cut-off value to 0.47 in the 180° rotating angle task, we could differentiate MCI patients from controls with a probability of 80.0%. Conclusions: We established a new screening system for dementia patients by evaluating visuospatial function. The RC ratio during a mental rotation task is useful for discriminating MCI patients from controls. ? 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

In this study, we synthesized polyethyleneglycol (PEG)-grafted GNPs and conjugated them with cyclodextrin (CD) to incorporate curcumin. Curcumin has anticancer effects but its therapeutic application is limited due to poor water solubility. Three types of CDs (α-, β-, and γ-CDs) were conjugated with PEGylated GNPs and the curcumin-containing CD/PEG-conjugated GNPs (cur-CD-GNPs) were characterized. Transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering results showed that these cur-CD-GNPs have a small gold nanocore (approximately 5nm) and the average size of the three cur-CD-GNPs was approximately 25–35nm. Curcumin was efficiently incorporated into the β-CD solution and the loading efficiency of curcumin in β-CD-GNPs was the highest of the three types of CD-GNPs prepared. The cytotoxic effect of cur-CD-GNPs was investigated using a human lung cancer cell line. All cur-CD-GNPs exhibited cytotoxic effects comparable to that of curcumin solution and CD-GNPs without curcumin were not cytotoxic. These results suggest that cur-CD-GNPs may be a useful multifunctional nanomedicine, although in vivo investigations are required. ? 2018 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Curcumin; Cyclodextrin; Gold nanoparticle; Nanomedicine; PEGylation; Poorly-water-soluble drug,alpha cyclodextrin; beta cyclodextrin; curcumin; gamma cyclodextrin; gold nanoparticle; macrogol; nanocarrier; antineoplastic agent; curcumin; cyclodextrin; gold; macrogol; metal nanoparticle; A-549 cell line; antineoplastic activity; Article; conjugation; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug dosage form comparison; drug solubility; human; human cell; in vitro study; nanomedicine; particle size; photon correlation spectroscopy; synthesis; transmission electron microscopy; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug formulation; transport at the cellular level; A549 Cells; Antineoplastic Agents; Biological Transport; Cell Survival; Curcumin; Cyclodextrins; Drug Compounding; Gold; Humans; Metal Nanoparticles; Polyethylene Glycols,2-s2.0-85048021746

Remodeling ratio was one of the additional new objective indexes for plaque characterization. On coronary CTA, the utility of histogram analysis was reported in a few studies. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of histogram analysis of carotid artery plaque density and positive remodeling on CTA for the diagnosis of pathologically proven complicated carotid artery plaques. Patients and Methods: We retrospectively evaluated 29 patients with atherosclerotic carotid artery stenosis treated by carotid endarterectomy. On CTA, the boundaries of non-calcified plaques were manually traced at the site of the greatest stenosis. In addition to the mean plaque density, the percentage of pixels (PP) with a density of less than 30 Hounsfield units (HU) (PP < 30) was calculated using the histogram analysis. We calculated the remodeling ratio by dividing the cross-sectional artery area at the greatest stenosis by normal reference-segment artery area. These results of CTA analysis were compared with the results of histological analysis based on the American heart association criteria. Results: Histologically, 13 of the 29 patients had complicated plaques. PP < 30 and the remodeling ratio were higher in patients with complicated plaques than in those with uncomplicated plaques (P = 0.023 and 0.002, respectively). Whereas, the mean plaque density did not differ between the two groups (P = 0.062). Correlation between PP < 30 and the remodeling ratio was stronger than the correlation between PP < 30 and the mean density (Spearman’s rs = 0.76 vs. 0.65, respectively). Conclusion: Histogram analysis of the carotid artery plaque density may be more useful for the evaluation of atherosclerosis on CTA compared with the conventional analysis of plaque densities, and the combined analysis of histogram analysis and the remodeling ratio may help to predict future stroke events. ? 2018, Iranian Journal of Radiology.",Atherosclerotic carotid artery plaque; CT angiography; Histogram analysis; Positive remodeling,aged; Article; blood vessel parameters; carotid artery obstruction; carotid artery plaque density; carotid atherosclerosis; carotid endarterectomy; clinical article; computed tomographic angiography; diagnostic value; disease severity; female; histogram; histopathology; human; intermethod comparison; male; positive remodeling ratio; radiological parameters; retrospective study,2-s2.0-85046246139

Methods NK012 was administered at doses of 12-24 mg/m2 and the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy were evaluated. Results Neutropenia was the most common grade 3 or 4 adverse drug reaction. Grade 4 neutropenia accounted for the majority of dose-limiting toxicities and only appeared at a dose of 24 mg/m2. The maximum concentrations and the area under the concentration-time curves from time zero to infinity for both NK012 and its active metabolite SN-38 increased in a dose-dependent manner. The best overall response was stable disease, which was achieved in 12 out of 16 patients. Conclusion The recommended dose of NK012 monotherapy for RRMM patients was concluded to be 20 mg/m2. However, this phase I/II study was terminated at the end of the phase I stage because no patients showed an objective response. Additional clinical studies of combination therapy with NK012 and other agents are warranted. ? 2018 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.",Bone marrow; Extramedullary lesions; Micelle; Multiple myeloma; SN-38,"C reactive protein; firtecan; glucuronosyltransferase 1A1; hemoglobin; polymer; camptothecin; DNA topoisomerase inhibitor; irinotecan; adult; aged; anemia; anorexia; area under the curve; Article; bone marrow biopsy; clinical article; cytotoxicity; dose calculation; dose response; drug dose escalation; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug screening; erythrocyte; female; genotype; hematocrit; hemoglobinopathy; human; hypokalemia; hyponatremia; leukopenia; lymphocytopenia; macromolecule; male; micelle; monotherapy; multicenter study; multiple myeloma; neutropenia; open study; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; polymerization; recommended drug dose; refractory period; relapse; relapsed refractory multiple myeloma; relapsed refractory multiple myeloma; survival time; thrombocytopenia; analogs and derivatives; chemically induced; clinical trial; micelle; middle aged; multiple myeloma; neutropenia; treatment failure; Aged; Camptothecin; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Humans; Male; Micelles; Middle Aged; Multiple Myeloma; Neutropenia; Polymers; Topoisomerase I Inhibitors; Treatment Failure",2-s2.0-85044723132

However, to our knowledge, no reports have investigated the utility of the normal lung volume for evaluating mortality from IPF. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the normally attenuated lung volume on HRCT as a percentage of whole-lung volume (NL%) and IPF mortality. Methods The NL% was determined by HRCT (between -950 and -701 Hounsfield units) using a density mask technique and volumetric software. The NL%, visual assessments of the normal lung by two radiologists, pulmonary function variables, and the gender, age, and physiology (GAP) index were retrospectively evaluated for 175 patients with IPF. Uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses and C statistics for mortality were performed. Results The univariate Cox proportional hazards analysis identified the NL% as a prognostic factor [hazard ratio, 0.949; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.936-0.964; p<0.0001]. In the multivariate analysis, the NL% was a prognostic factor, but the radiologists’ visual assessment scores of normal lung were not. The C index increased when the NL% was included in the models of the pulmonary function variables. Furthermore, the C index for a combined model of GAP stage and categorized NL% (0.758; 95% CI, 0.751-0.762) was higher than for the model with the GAP stage alone (0.689; 95% CI, 0.672-0.709). Conclusion The NL% was a prognostic factor in our study population. Quantification of the normal lung using our method may help improve the IPF staging systems. ? 2018 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.",Computed tomography; Computer-aided diagnosis; Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis; Mortality,aged; Article; cause of death; clinical evaluation; controlled study; female; fibrosing alveolitis; high resolution computer tomography; human; image analysis; lung function; lung volume; major clinical study; male; mortality rate; practice guideline; prognostic assessment; respiratory tract disease assessment; retrospective study; cone beam computed tomography; diagnostic imaging; fibrosing alveolitis; Kaplan Meier method; lung; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathology; pathophysiology; prognosis; proportional hazards model; severity of illness index; Aged; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Female; Humans; Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lung; Lung Volume Measurements; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Retrospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index,2-s2.0-85044712361

GPX2 expression gradually increased during progression from normal to papillary or nodular hyperplasia (PNHP) and urothelial carcinoma (UC) in a rat N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl) nitrosamine (BBN)- induced bladder carcinogenesis model. GPX2 overexpression was more marked in UC with squamous differentiation (SqD) than in pure UC. Clinical intraepithelial lesions of papillary UC and invasive UC with SqD also had strong GPX2 expression in human radical cystectomy specimens. In addition, prognostic analysis using transurethral specimens revealed that low expression level of GPX2 predicted poor prognosis in patients with pure UC. Further, UC cell lines, BC31 and RT4, cultured in vitro also overexpressed GPX2. Knock-down of GPX2 induced significant inhibition of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, in addition to significant growth inhibition and increased apoptosis with activation of caspase 3 or 7 in both BC31 and RT4 cells. Interestingly, tumor growth of BC31 cells subcutaneously transplanted in nude mice was significantly caused the induction of apoptosis, as well as inhibition of angiogenesis and SqD by GPX2 down-regulation. Our findings demonstrated that GPX2 plays an important role in bladder carcinogenesis through the regulation of apoptosis against intracellular ROS, and may be considered as a novel biomarker or therapeutic target in bladder cancer. ?

However, the prevalence rates for A. xylosoxidans may vary significantly from country to country. To assess this association, the prevalence of A. xylosoxidans was analyzed in Japanese patients with pulmonary B-cell lymphoma. Methods DNA samples were obtained from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of pulmonary MALT lymphomas (n=52), diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs, n=18), and benign pulmonary lesions (n=19). All samples were histopathologically reviewed by experienced hematopathologists, and the clonality of all MALT lymphoma cases was confirmed by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based IGH rearrangement clonality assay. They were also tested for the API2-MALT1 fusion transcript. The presence of bacterial DNA was assessed with a nested PCR, and DNA sequencing was performed to confirm the PCR specificity. Results A. xylosoxidans DNA was detected in 1/52 cases of pulmonary MALT lymphoma, 2/18 cases of DLBCL, and 0/19 cases of benign pulmonary lesions. The prevalence of A. xylosoxidans in pulmonary lymphoma was not significantly higher than in benign lesions. Conclusion The present study shows that A. xylosoxidans infection may not be associated with pulmonary B-cell lymphoma in a Japanese case series.

Methods: The UPAO test was performed on 91 patients who were scheduled to undergo or were being considered for pneumonectomy or pleuropneumonectomy between June 2003 and July 2016. There were 74 males and 17 females, with a median age of 65 years (range, 23–80). The technical success rate, procedure time and complication rate were evaluated. Technical success was defined as completion of the UPAO test. Results: The diagnoses of the 91 patients were as follows: lung cancer in 63, malignant pleural mesothelioma in 21, thymoma in 5, lung metastasis in 1 and lung carcinoid in 1. The UPAO test was performed successfully on 88 out of 91 patients (technical success rate: 97%). The median procedure time was 57min (range, 34–120). Cardiac arrest due to migration of the balloon catheter to the pulmonary trunk occurred in 1 patient (complication rate: 1.1%). Conclusion: The UPAO test in pre-operative evaluation of pneumonectomy or pleuropneumonectomy for lung or pleural tumours appears to be technically feasible. However, it needs to be performed with care in order to avoid severe complications.

In this study, we investigated the effects of the angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AT2R) agonist Compound 21 (C21), which is expected to play similar roles to an ARB, on prostate carcinogenesis using the transgenic rat for adenocarcinoma of prostate (TRAP) model previously established in our laboratory. In vitro analyses of the cell growth, Western blotting and reporter gene assays were performed using LNCaP cells. TRAP rats at 6 weeks of age were randomly divided into 3 groups of 12 animals each and treated with C21 at 1 or 2 mg/kg/day in drinking water for 12 weeks. C21 reduced the proliferation activity of prostate cancer cells and down-regulated the PSA promoter activity and the AR protein expression. We discovered that C21 inhibited the progression of prostate carcinogenesis in TRAP rats and decreased the incidence of adenocarcinoma in the lateral prostate. A significant increase in the apoptotic index with activation of caspase 3 and 7 were observed by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting analyses. C21 also down-regulated the expression of AR significantly in TRAP rat prostate. C21 decreased the expression of AR and reduced the proliferation activity effectively in prostate cancer cells and TRAP rat prostate.

The present study investigated the influence of smoking cessation on the incidence of metabolic syndrome and its components in the Japanese general population. Methods: This study enrolled individuals without metabolic syndrome or a history of smoking via our annual health checkup program (n=5,702, 55.2±11.5 years). Participants were divided into three groups mentioned below and followed up with the endpoint being the development of metabolic syndrome: (1) subjects who had never smoked and did not smoke during the observation period (non-smoker); (2) those who continued smoking during the observation period (continuous smoker); and (3) those who ceased smoking during the observation period (smoking cessation). Results: During the observation period (median 1,089 days), 520 subjects developed metabolic syndrome, and Kaplan–Meier analysis showed a higher incidence of metabolic syndrome in the smoking cessation group than in the other groups. Smoking cessation was confirmed as an independent predictor of the new onset of metabolic syndrome by multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis after adjustment. Subjects only from the smoking cessation group showed a significant deterioration in metabolic factors during the study in correlation with an increased waist circumference after smoking cessation. Conclusions: Smoking cessation without instruction could be followed by the development of metabolic syndrome, and the incidence of metabolic syndrome might reduce the benefit obtained from smoking cessation. Therefore, further educational outreach is needed to prevent the progression of metabolic syndrome during the course of smoking cessation. ? 2018 Japan Atherosclerosis Society.",Body weight; Cessation; Metabolic syndrome; Smoking; Waist circumference,high density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Article; diastolic blood pressure; disorders of lipid and lipoprotein metabolism; female; human; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; public health; smoking cessation; waist circumference; aged; body mass; body weight; body weight gain; cohort analysis; complication; incidence; Japan; Kaplan Meier method; lifestyle; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; patient education; procedures; proportional hazards model; risk factor; smoking; tobacco dependence; Aged; Body Mass Index; Body Weight; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Life Style; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Tobacco Use Disorder; Waist Circumference; Weight Gain,2-s2.0-85042649448

However, measurement and analysis are complex for several specific sleep disorders, such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD). Usually, brain waves during REM sleep indicate an awakening pattern under relaxed conditions of skeletal and antigravity muscles. However, these muscles are activated during REM sleep when patients suffer from RBD. These activated muscle movements during REM, so-called REM without atonia (RWA) recorded by PSG, may be related to a neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinson's disease. Thus, careful analysis of RWA is significant not only physically, but also clinically. Commonly, manual viewing measurement analysis of RWA is time-consuming. Therefore, quantitative studies on RWA are rarely reported. A software program, developed from Microsoft Office Excel?, was used to semiautomatically analyze the RWA ratio extracted from PSG to compare with manual viewing measurement analysis. In addition, a quantitative muscle tonus study was carried out to evaluate the effect of medication on RBD patients. Using this new software program, we were able to analyze RWA on the same cases in approximately 15 min as compared with 60 min in the manual viewing measurement analysis. This software program can not only quantify RWA easily but also identify RWA waves for either phasic or tonic bursts. We consider that this software program will support physicians and scientists in their future research on RBD.

Male ICR mice were injected with each metal compound intraperitoneally at 6 different time points over the course of a day (zeitgeber time [ZT]: ZT2, ZT6, ZT10, ZT14, ZT18 and ZT22). Mortality was then monitored until 14 days after the injection. Our investigation demonstrated that mice were tolerant against Ni toxicity during dark phase, on the other hand, they were tolerant against Cr toxicity during light phase. The chronotoxicity of Hg and Pb seemed to be biphasic. Further, mice were susceptible to toxicities against Cu and Zn in the time zone during which light and dark were reversed. Interestingly, no significant differences were observed for Fe exposure at any time of the day. Our results propose that the chronotoxicology may provide valuable information regarding the importance of injection timing for not only toxicity evaluation tests but also the reproducibility of animal experiments.

At 48 h, the LVEF, increase in the LVEF, and reduction of AST from 0-h were identified as independent predictors in the S-group. Finally, we developed an S-group prediction model comprising these 3 variables (area under the curve, 0.844; 95% confidence interval, 0.745–0.944). Conclusions: We developed a model for use 48 h after VA-ECMO initiation to predict successful BTR in patients with FM. ? 2018, Japanese Circulation Society.

Cisplatin has been used as a key drug in the treatment for patients with lung cancer; however, most of the patients failed to respond to cisplatin within several months, and the mechanisms underlying the cisplatin resistance have not been fully elucidated. Apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain (ASC) is a key adaptor protein in the formation of inflammasomes. ASC is also involved in apoptotic signaling. Importantly, ASC expression is decreased in lung cancer and various cancers, but its precise function in tumor progression remains unknown. To explore the hitherto unknown role of ASC in lung cancer, we initially searched for lung cancer cell lines with higher expression levels of ASC using Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) database, thereby identifying the A549 human non-small cell lung cancer cell line. Accordingly, with retroviral shRNA, the expression of ASC was forced to decrease in A549 cells. Stable ASC-knockdown cells, thus established, showed the increased activities of proliferation, motility, and invasion, compared with control cells. Importantly, ASC-knockdown cells also became resistant to cisplatin, but not to other anti-cancer agents, 5-fluorouracil and paclitaxel. Bcl-2 and phospho-Src levels were increased in ASC-knockdown cells. A Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-199, induced an apoptotic response in ASC-knockdown cells, and dasatinib, a Src inhibitor, blocked cell invasiveness. Thus, ASC may be involved in tumor suppression and cell death via Bcl-2 and pSrc. Targeting Bcl-2 and Src in ASC-downregulated populations of lung cancer may improve treatment outcome. ? 2018 Tohoku University Medical Press.",ASC; Bcl-2; Cisplatin resistance; Lung cancer; Src,"apoptosis associated speck like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain protein; apoptosis repressor with caspase recruitment domain; cisplatin; dasatinib; fluorouracil; paclitaxel; protein bcl 2; protein tyrosine kinase; short hairpin RNA; unclassified drug; venetoclax; caspase recruitment domain signaling protein; cisplatin; protein bcl 2; protein tyrosine kinase; PYCARD protein, human; apoptosis; Article; cancer growth; cancer resistance; cell invasion; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; drug sensitivity; enzyme activity; human; human cell; non small cell lung cancer; protein expression; protein function; protein targeting; treatment outcome; A-549 cell line; apoptosis; drug effect; drug resistance; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; lung tumor; metabolism; phenotype; phosphorylation; upregulation; A549 Cells; Apoptosis; CARD Signaling Adaptor Proteins; Cisplatin; Drug Resistance, Neoplasm; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Knockdown Techniques; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Phenotype; Phosphorylation; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; src-Family Kinases; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85042409601

Aberrant expression of miRNA genes causes various human diseases, especially cancers. Although cancer is a complex disease, cancer/miRNA implication has yet been grasped from the perspective of miRNA profile in bed side. Since miRNA is the mobile genetic element, the clinical verification of miRNA?in microvesicle of blood is too much straggle to predict potential cancer/miRNA associations without bioinformatical computing. Further, experimental investigation of miRNA/cancer pathways is expensive and time-consuming. While the accumulated data (big data) of miRNA profiles has been on line as the databases in cancers, using the database algorithms for miRNA target prediction have reduced required time for conventional experiments and have cut the cost. Computational prediction of miRNA/target mRNA has shown numerous significant outcomes that are unobtainable only by experimental approaches. However, ID of miRNA in the annotation is an arbitrary number and the ID is not related with miRNA its functions. Therefore, it has not been physicochemically shown why multiple miRNAs in blood or tissues are useful for diagnosis and porgnosis of human diseases or why function of single miRNA in cancer is rendered to oncomir or tumopr suppressor. In addition, it is less cleared why environmental factors, such as temperature, radiation, therapeutic anti-cancer immune or chemical agents can alter the expression of miRNAs in the cell. The ceRNA theory would not be enough for the investigation of such subjects. Given miRNA/target prediction tools, to elucidate such issues with computer simulation?we have previously introduced the quantum miRNA/miRNA interaction as a new scoring using big database. The quantum score was implicated in miRNA synergisms in cancer and participated in the miRNA/target interaction on human diseases. On the other hand, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is the dominant RNA species of the cells. It is well known that ribosomopathies, such as Diamond-Blackfan anemia, dyskeratiosis congenital, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, 5q-myelodysplastic syndrome, Treacher Collins syndrome, cartilage-hair hypoplasia, North American Indian childhood cirrhosis, isolated congenital asplenia, Bowen-Conradi syndrome and cancer are caused by altered expression of ribosomal proteins or rRNA genes. We have?proposed the hypothesis that?the interaction among miRNAs from rRNA and/or other cellular miRNAs would be involved into cancer as the ribosomopathy. Subsequently, we found rRNA-derived miRNAs (rmiRNAs) by using the sequence homology search?(miPS) with miRNA database?(miRBase). Further, the pathway?related with cancer between rmiRNA/target protein gene was predicted by miRNA entangling target sorting (METS) algorithm. In this chapter, we describe about the usage of in silico miRNA identification program, miRNA/target prediction search through the database and quantum language of miRNA?by the METS, and the ontology analysis. In particular, the METS algorithm according to the quantum value would be useful simulator to discover a new therapeutic target aganist cancer. It may?also partly contribute to the elucidation of complex mechanisms and development of agents of anti-cancer. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",AluRNA; Big data; Biomarker; Cancer; microRNA; Quantum; Ribosomal RNA,"microRNA; ribosome DNA; transfer RNA; microRNA; small untranslated RNA; algorithm; Alu sequence; gene identification; human; interactions with RNA; magnetic field; malignant neoplasm; protein secondary structure; quantum mechanics; RNA sequence; biology; conformation; gene ontology; genetics; neoplasm; nucleic acid database; procedures; quantum theory; RNA interference; Algorithms; Alu Elements; Computational Biology; Databases, Nucleic Acid; Gene Ontology; Humans; MicroRNAs; Neoplasms; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Quantum Theory; RNA Interference; RNA, Small Untranslated",2-s2.0-85042024025

Such evidence implies a strong connection between diabetes and cancer. Recently, glucagon has been recognized as a pivotal factor implicated in the pathophysiology of diabetes. Glucagon acts through binding to its receptor, glucagon receptor (GCGR), and crosstalk between GCGR-mediated signals and signaling pathways that regulate cancer cell fate has been unveiled. In the current study, expression of GCGR in colon cancer cell lines and colon cancer tissue obtained from patients was demonstrated. Glucagon significantly promoted colon cancer cell growth, and GCGR knockdown with small interfering RNA attenuated the proliferation-promoting effect of glucagon on colon cancer cells. Molecular assays showed that glucagon acted as an activator of cancer cell growth through deactivation of AMPK and activation of MAPK in a GCGRdependent manner. Moreover, a stable GCGR knockdown mouse colon cancer cell line, CMT93, grew significantly slower than control in a syngeneic mouse model of type 2 diabetes with glycemia and hyperglucagonemia. The present observations provide experimental evidence that hyperglucagonemia in type 2 diabetes promotes colon cancer progression via GCGR-mediated regulation of AMPK and MAPK pathways. ?

However, PI resistance remains an unresolved problem in the therapy of relapsed and refractory MM. To develop a new PI that targets other proteasome subunits, we examined the anti-MM activity of a novel syringolin analog, syringolog-1, which inhibits the activity of both the β5 and β2 subunits. Syringolog-1 exhibited marked cytotoxicity against various MM cell lines and anti-tumor activity towards bortezomib (Btz)-resistant MM cells through the dual inhibition of chymotrypsin-like (β5 subunit) and trypsin-like (β2 subunit) activities. MM cells, including Btz-resistant cells, showed elevated CHOP and NOXA expression after syringolog-1 treatment, indicating the induction of excessive endoplasmic reticulum stress during syringolog-1 treatment. Similar activities of syringolog-1 were also observed in freshly prepared MM cells derived from patients. To clarify the anti-tumor mechanism of dual inhibition of both the β5 and β2 subunits of the proteasome, PSMB5 and PSMB7 were co-inhibited in MM cells. This resulted in increased apoptosis of MM cells accompanied by accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins compared to inhibition of either PSMB7 or PSMB5 alone, indicating an enhanced effect by double inhibition of β2 and β5 activities. In conclusion, this syringolin analog, a dual inhibitor of proteasome β2 and β5 activities, exhibited potent anti-tumor effects on MM cells and may be useful for overcoming Btz-resistance in the treatment of MM. ?

Twenty-five patients with carcinoma of the external and middle ear were retrospectively analyzed. The modified Pittsburgh staging system was used for staging of the patients. Overall and disease-free survival was estimated using of Kaplan-Meier method. In our cohort of 25 patients, the majority (76%) had tumor located in external auditory meatus. The most common histologic subtype was squamous cell carcinoma (80%). More than half of patients (56%) had tumor stage IV. In the stage IV group, five patients underwent subtotal temporal bone resection and ipsilateral neck dissection. Seven patients underwent definitive radiotherapy. The remaining two patients underwent palliative chemotherapy. The 2-year overall and disease-free survival for patients with tumor stage IV was 67.7% and 57.8%, respectively. In patients with tumor stage IV, the 2-year overall survival for patients who underwent surgery was 80.0% versus 53.6% for those who underwent radiotherapy (P = 0.16).

The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that an increased IASBPD is associated with reduced physical activity in older people. Methods: Older people who used a geriatric health services facility (n = 147, mean age 83.3 years) were enrolled. The prevalence of IASBPD in individuals with different levels of physical activity and factors that have a crucial effect on IASBPD were investigated. The study participants were divided into three groups according to their physical activity; ambulant persons (group A), wheelchair users (group B) and bedridden persons (group C). Blood pressure around the both brachiums was simultaneously measured using two automated devices. An IASBPD of ?10 mmHg was considered to be significant IASBPD. Results: The median IASBPD was 4.5 mmHg in the present study participants, and 28 participants (19.0%) had an IASBPD ?10 mmHg. The IASBPD in group C was greater than that in group A or B. Multivariate linear regression analysis showed that physical activity was the independent predictor of IASBPD after adjustment for possible factors. Furthermore, a logistic regression analysis with the end-point of significant IASBPD showed that physical activity is an independent predictor of significant IASBPD. Conclusions: Physical activity simply assessed by moving ability can predict IASBPD in older individuals.

The purpose of this study was to clarify the frequency, clinical indicators and predictors of cognitive dysfunction among newly diagnosed older patients with hematologic malignancy receiving first-line chemotherapy. Methods: Patients aged 65 years or over with a primary diagnosis of malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma were consecutively recruited. Cognitive dysfunction was evaluated using the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) twice: before starting chemotherapy (T1) and 1 month later (T2). Participants also underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment at T1. Potential clinical indicators that were associated with cognitive dysfunction were explored via cross-sectional analysis at T1. Predictors of cognitive dysfunction at T2 were also investigated among patients without cognitive dysfunction at T1. Results: A total of 145 participants participated in the study; cognitive dysfunction at T1 was present in 20%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that lower educational attainment and poorer instrumental activities of daily living were significant clinical indicators of cognitive dysfunction. Among 99 patients who did not have cognitive dysfunction at T1 and underwent cognitive assessment at T2, 7% developed dysfunction. Subjective perception of difficulty remembering at T1 was the only factor which significantly predicted new-onset cognitive dysfunction at T2. Conclusions: The prevalence rate of cognitive dysfunction was non-negligible among older patients with hematologic malignancy before and immediately after initial chemotherapy. Attention to the clinical indicators and predictors found in this study may provide facilitate the identification of cognitive dysfunction in patients with cancer. ? The Author 2017.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between the early appearance on magnetic resonance imaging of the acetabular labrum and lateral pillar involvement in Legg-Calv?-Perthes disease. Methods Non-contrast magnetic resonance images of 26 hips in 25 children with early-stage Legg-Calv?-Perthes disease were retrospectively reviewed. The extent of labral horizontalization was quantitatively evaluated with a new method, the labral angle, on T2*-weighted magnetic resonance images. A small labral angle indicates strong labral horizontalization. Calculation of the teardrop distance and acetabular head index on radiographs was modified for application to magnetic resonance imaging, and the extent of cartilaginous lateral subluxation (cartilaginous tear drop distance) and cartilaginous lateral extrusion (cartilaginous acetabular head index) were evaluated. The outcome measure was the lateral pillar classification. Results There were statistically significant correlations between the labral angle and the cartilaginous tear drop distance (p = 0.002, ? = ?0.58) and the cartilaginous acetabular head index (p < 0.001, ? = 0.65) on magnetic resonance images. The labral angle was small in order of groups C, B, and A, and there were significant differences between groups A and C (p < 0.001) and B and C (p = 0.006). Conclusion Greater labral horizontalization observed on magnetic resonance imaging at the early stage of Legg-Calv?-Perthes disease correlated with strong cartilaginous lateral subluxation and extrusion, and with increased lateral pillar collapse at the maximum fragmentation stage. Our finding suggests that a quantitative evaluation of labral horizontalization using magnetic resonance imaging in the early-stage of Legg-Calv?-Perthes disease can predict the later lateral pillar classification. ? 2017 The Japanese Orthopaedic Association",,"acetabular labrum; acetabulum; Article; articular cartilage; cartilage; child; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative study; disease classification; disease course; female; femoral head; femur epiphysis; femur osteotomy; hip arthroplasty; hip dislocation; hip osteotomy; hip radiography; human; infant; lateral pillar classification; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Perthes disease; prediction; quantitative analysis; reliability; retrospective study; subluxation; chi square distribution; classification; diagnostic imaging; early diagnosis; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; observer variation; pathophysiology; Perthes disease; predictive value; preschool child; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; severity of illness index; Acetabulum; Cartilage, Articular; Chi-Square Distribution; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Early Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Legg-Calve-Perthes Disease; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Observer Variation; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Severity of Illness Index",2-s2.0-85040224605

Serial perioperative changes in ghrelin have been examined in several surgical procedures, but few in pancreatectomy. The present study analyzed perioperative changes in plasma ghrelin levels after pancreaduodenectomy (PD). Methods: The study included 24 patients undergoing PD between May 2015 and January 2016 at Osaka University Hospital. Plasma ghrelin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels, as well as white blood cells (WBCs) and C-reactive protein (CRP), were measured preoperatively and on postoperative day (POD) 1, 3, 7, and 14 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The relationship between the individual ghrelin ratio relative to preoperative value (IGR) and the development of grade IIIa-V Clavien-Dindo (CD) complications was examined. Results: Twelve patients (50%) developed grade IIIa CD complications (n = 6 [25%] pancreatic fistula, n = 7 [29%] intraabdominal abscess, n = 3 [13%] post-pancreatectomy hemorrhage, n = 5 [21%] wound infection, and n = 1 [4%] lymphorrhea). The IGR on POD 1 was significantly lower (p = 0.014) in patients who developed the complications compared to those who did not, but no significant differences were found in terms of WBC, CRP, or IL-6 on POD 1. When the IGR cut-off was set to 82% by receiver operative curve analysis, the sensitivity was 83%, specificity 75% and area under the curve 0.80. The lower IGR group (?82%) had more postoperative complications and longer hospital stay. Conclusions: The IGR on POD 1 after PD is a useful marker for predicting postoperative complications. ? 2017 IAP and EPC",C-reactive protein; Clavien-Dindo complication; Individual ghrelin ratio; Interleukin-6; Pancreatoduodenectomy,C reactive protein; ghrelin; interleukin 6; biological marker; ghrelin; abdominal abscess; aged; Article; clinical article; cohort analysis; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; female; hormone blood level; human; inflammation; length of stay; leukocyte; lymphorrhea; male; operation duration; pancreas fistula; pancreatectomy; pancreaticoduodenectomy; perioperative period; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; predictive value; preoperative evaluation; priority journal; prospective study; sensitivity and specificity; surgical infection; blood; odds ratio; pancreas fistula; pancreaticoduodenectomy; postoperative complication; postoperative period; risk factor; statistical model; Aged; Biomarkers; Female; Ghrelin; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Odds Ratio; Pancreatic Fistula; Pancreaticoduodenectomy; Postoperative Complications; Postoperative Period; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85039053694

However, responses to omalizumab vary widely among patients. Objectives This study aimed to assess the potential of baseline serum cytokine levels as predictors of responsiveness to omalizumab. Methods Thirty-one patients with severe, persistent asthma were enrolled in this study and administered omalizumab for at least 1 year. Response to omalizumab was assessed based on the physician's global evaluation of treatment effectiveness (GETE) at 48 weeks of treatment. Blood samples were collected at baseline and 16 and 32 weeks after starting omalizumab and measured for 30 cytokines by Luminex 200 and ELISA. Exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) levels, peripheral blood eosinophil counts, pre-bronchodilator pulmonary functions and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire scores were determined at baseline and 16, 32 and 48 weeks after starting omalizumab. The numbers of clinically significant asthma exacerbations in the previous year and during 48 weeks of treatment with omalizumab were assessed. Results GETE assessment showed 19 responders (61.3%) and 12 non-responders (38.7%). Responders showed significantly higher levels of CXCL10 and IL-12 at baseline compared to non-responders (CXCL10: responders, 1530.0 ± 315.2 pg/ml vs. non-responders, 1066.0 ± 396.8 pg/ml, P = 0.001; IL-12: responders, 60.2 ± 39.2 pg/ml vs. non-responders, 32.2 ± 26.3 pg/ml, P = 0.04). ROC curves to distinguish responders from non-responders using the baseline serum CXCL10 level showed a good AUC of 0.83. At 32 weeks of omalizumab therapy, serum CXCL10 tended to be increased (1350 ± 412.3 pg/ml at baseline vs. 1529 ± 637.6 pg/ml at 32 weeks, P = 0.16) and serum IL-12 tended to be decreased (49.4 ± 37.0 pg/ml at baseline vs. 43.9 ± 30.9 pg/ml at 32 weeks, P = 0.05). On the other hand, serum IL-5 and PDGF were significantly decreased (IL-5: 54.2 ± 13.8 pg/ml at baseline vs. 49.1 ± 12.5 pg/ml at 32 weeks, P = 0.008; PDGF: 4821 ± 2458 pg/ml at baseline vs. 4219 ± 1951 pg/ml at 32 weeks, P = 0.048). Conclusions High baseline serum CXCL10 and IL-12 levels may be useful in predicting a good omalizumab response in severe asthmatics. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Asthma; CXCL10; IgE; IL-12; Omalizumab,"carbon tetrachloride; fluticasone propionate; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor; interleukin 1 receptor blocking agent; interleukin 10; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 15; interleukin 17; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 33; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; interleukin 7; interleukin 8; macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha; nitric oxide; omalizumab; platelet derived growth factor; platelet derived growth factor BB; prednisolone; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor; vasculotropin; antiasthmatic agent; biological marker; CXCL10 protein, human; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; interleukin 12; omalizumab; adult; Article; Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score; blood sampling; clinical article; controlled study; disease duration; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug efficacy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; eosinophil count; female; forced expiratory volume; fractional exhaled nitric oxide; human; lung function; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; priority journal; protein blood level; receiver operating characteristic; respiratory tract parameters; severe persistent asthma; treatment response; aged; asthma; blood; clinical trial; drug effect; follow up; immunology; pathophysiology; physiology; prognosis; quality of life; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Anti-Asthmatic Agents; Asthma; Biomarkers; Chemokine CXCL10; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Forced Expiratory Volume; Humans; Interleukin-12; Male; Middle Aged; Omalizumab; Prognosis; Quality of Life; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85037633360

Because of the difficulty of discriminating PFIC1 from other subtypes of PFIC based on its clinical and histological features and genome sequencing, an alternative method for diagnosing PFIC1 is desirable. Herein, we analyzed human peripheral blood monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) and found predominant expression of ATP8B1 in interleukin-10 (IL-10)-induced M2c, a subset of alternatively activated macrophages. SiRNA-mediated depletion of ATP8B1 in IL-10-treated HMDM markedly suppressed the expression of M2c-related surface markers and increased the side scatter (SSC) of M2c, likely via impairment of the IL-10/STAT3 signal transduction pathway. These phenotypic features were confirmed in IL-10-treated HMDM from four PFIC1 patients with disease-causing mutations in both alleles, but not in those from four patients with other subtypes of PFIC. This method identified three PFIC1 patients in a group of PFIC patients undiagnosed by genome sequencing, an identical diagnostic outcome to that achieved by analysis of liver specimens and in vitro mutagenesis studies. In conclusion, ATP8B1 deficiency caused incomplete polarization of HMDM into M2c. Phenotypic analysis of M2c helps to identify PFIC1 patients with no apparent disease-causing mutations in ATP8B1. ? 2017 The Authors",Diagnosis; Pediatric liver disease; Progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis,"bilirubin; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 4; small interfering RNA; STAT3 protein; adenosine triphosphatase; ATP8B1 protein, human; biological marker; gamma glutamyltransferase; interleukin 10; STAT3 protein; Article; ATP8B1 deficiency; ATP8B1 gene; bilirubin blood level; child; clinical article; female; flow cytometry; gene; gene sequence; genetic disorder; human; in vitro study; inflammation; intrahepatic cholestasis; liver biopsy; macrophage; male; mutagenesis; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; preschool child; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; pruritus; school child; adolescent; blood; cholestasis; deficiency; genetics; liver; macrophage; metabolism; monocyte; pathology; phenotype; signal transduction; Adenosine Triphosphatases; Adolescent; Biomarkers; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholestasis; Female; gamma-Glutamyltransferase; Humans; Interleukin-10; Liver; Macrophages; Male; Monocytes; Mutagenesis; Phenotype; Signal Transduction; STAT3 Transcription Factor",2-s2.0-85032959719

Through this guidance, people considered at high risk of developing metabolic syndrome are expected to be made aware of their own problems in terms of their daily lifestyle choices and to improve their daily life behaviors by themselves. To support this large undertaking with information technology, we have introduced ideas based on the Bayesian estimation in data mining technology and proposed a Bayesian network (BN) scheme connecting the information from physical examinations and daily lifestyle questionnaires. By applying this network model to the field data on 11,947 anonymized individuals, the proposed method was found to provide better performance and show its potentiality for the system of specific health checkup. We introduced a novel 4-bit representation with 16 states, treating body shape, blood lipids, blood glucose, and blood pressure as equal binary factors, and analyzed relationships among the support level, physical examination, and daily lifestyle questionnaire. In addition, we applied this BN to individual cases and showed its utility in allowing an examinee to improve his/her lifestyle by demonstrating individual predictions. Through the efforts described above, we confirmed that the Bayesian network for Specific Health Checkup and Guidance has the potential to be an effective support tool for health promotion regarding metabolic syndrome. ?

Methods: Psychological mental distress was assessed using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6). We compared patients with (i) low pre-NIPT K6 and low post-partum K6 scores (control group), and (ii) low pre-NIPT K6 and a high post-partum K6 scores (case group). Results: Among the 697 women who underwent NIPT, 29 (4.2%) had low pre-NIPT K6 and high post-partum K6 scores (case group) and 668 (95.8%) had low pre-NIPT K6 and low post-partum K6 scores (control). Among women with negative NIPT findings, post-partum women with a high K6 score were compared to a control group of women with a low K6 score. Logistic regression analysis showed that primiparity (P = 0.007), low birthweight (P = 0.005) and use of intracytoplasmic sperm injection (P = 0.02) and assisted reproductive technology (P = 0.05) were significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: Even if women do not feel mental distress before NIPT, they may develop mental stress post-partum. In particular, primipara women who conceived through assisted reproductive technology (especially intracytoplasmic sperm injection) and gave birth to a low birthweight baby were more susceptible to developing post-partum distress. Thus, it is important to educate women that support is available, with consultation with other healthcare professionals during genetic counseling if necessary.

Methods: Cross-sectional analyses for prevalent headache (n?=?35,908) and 1-year follow-up analyses for incident headache (n?=?19,788) were conducted in apparently healthy white-collar men aged 25–59?years. Headache (yes/no), working hours and sleep duration were based on self-administered questionnaire. After determination of relationships between working hours and sleep duration, logistic regression analysis estimated odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval for prevalent and incident headache according to working hours (35–44, 45–49, 50–59 and ?60?h/week) and sleep duration (?7, 6–6.9, 5–5.9 and <5?h/day), and tested linear trends in OR. Additionally, interactive effects of working hours and sleep duration on OR were checked. Covariates in the analyses were age, body mass index, drinking, smoking and exercise. Results: Prevalent and incident headache was found in 1979 (5.5%) men and 707 (3.6%) men, respectively. Working hours were inversely associated with sleep duration. OR for prevalent and incident headache rose with increasing working hours and with reducing sleep duration, regardless of influences of the covariates. Working hours and sleep duration had no interactive effects on OR for prevalent or incident headache. Conclusions: The results indicate that long working hours directly and indirectly (via short sleep duration) induce headache even in apparently healthy white-collar men.

FDR <.1 and showing either high or median for context score+ in miRSearch among the 72 carefully selected genes related to angiogenesis or calcification; and (3) FDR <.1 in the comparison of 10 individual sets of high- and low-calcified plaques. The expression of miRNA validated by qRT-PCR revealed a significant downregulation of hsa-miR-4530, hsa-miR133b, and hsa-miR-1-3p. A Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed that the logarithmic TGSs for the microarray of hsa-miR-4530 and hsa-miR-133b were significantly inversely correlated with the carotid plaques' calcium scores, and the delta Cq values for the qRT-PCR showed a direct association. Conclusions: In high-calcified carotid plaques, a specific profile for miRNA may be identified, and the expressions of hsa-miR-4530 and hsa-miR-133b had inverse correlations with the calcium score in the plaques, suggesting that miRNAs may play a modulating role in calcified plaques and plaque stability. ? 2018 National Stroke Association",angiogenesis; calcification; carotid plaque; microarray analysis; microRNA,"angiopoietin related protein 4; calcium; fibroblast growth factor receptor 1; fibroblast growth factor receptor 2; microRNA; microRNA 1; microRNA 133b; microRNA 221; microRNA 4530; osteopontin; transcription factor MSX2; transcription factor RUNX2; unclassified drug; vasculotropin A; microRNA; MIRN133 microRNA, human; transcriptome; adult; aged; angiogenesis; artery calcification; Article; carotid atherosclerosis; carotid endarterectomy; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; disease severity; female; human; human tissue; hypertension; male; microarray analysis; middle aged; priority journal; protein expression; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; atherosclerotic plaque; biology; blood vessel calcification; carotid artery; carotid artery disease; chemistry; computed tomographic angiography; data mining; diagnostic imaging; DNA microarray; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic database; genetic marker; genetics; multidetector computed tomography; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; severity of illness index; validation study; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Artery Diseases; Computational Biology; Computed Tomography Angiography; Data Mining; Databases, Genetic; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetic Markers; Humans; MicroRNAs; Multidetector Computed Tomography; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reproducibility of Results; Severity of Illness Index; Transcriptome; Vascular Calcification",2-s2.0-85029550358

However, a growing number of reports have indicated the role of glial cells in higher brain function through their interaction with neurons. Myelin was originally thought to be just a sheath structure surrounding neuronal axons, but recently it has been shown that myelin exerts effects on the conduction velocity of neuronal axons even after myelin formation. Therefore, the investigation of glial cell properties and the neuron-glial interactions is important for understanding higher brain function. Moreover, since there are many neurological disorders caused by glial abnormalities, further understanding of glial cell-related diseases and the development of effective therapeutic strategies are warranted. In this review, we focused on oligodendrocyte-neuron interactions, with particular attention on (1) axonal signals underlying oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination, (2) neuronal activity-dependent myelination and (3) the effects of myelination on higher brain function. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Activity-dependency; Motor skill learning; Myelination; Neuronal electrical activity; Oligodendrocyte,Article; brain function; brain maturation; cognition; electric activity; glial precursor cell; human; motor learning; myelination; nerve cell differentiation; oligodendroglia; priority journal; animal; axon; brain; cell communication; cell differentiation; cytology; glia; metabolism; mouse; myelin sheath; nerve cell; oligodendroglia; physiology; Animals; Axons; Brain; Cell Communication; Cell Differentiation; Mice; Myelin Sheath; Neuroglia; Neurons; Oligodendroglia,2-s2.0-85029515241

To the authors' knowledge, no consistent evidence of an association between cigarette smoking and the risk of M-SGCs has appeared to date. Furthermore, evidence of potential heterogeneity in the impact of smoking on histopathological subtypes is scarce, despite the fact that the histopathological subtypes of M-SGC exhibit different genetic features. METHODS: The authors conducted a case-control study to investigate the association between smoking and M-SGC by histopathological subtype. Cases were 81 patients with M-SGCs and the controls were 810 age-matched and sex-matched first-visit outpatients without cancer treated at Aichi Cancer Center Hospital from 1988 to 2005. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were assessed by conditional logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders. RESULTS: Smoking was found to be associated with a significantly increased risk of M-SGC overall, with an OR of 3.45 (95% CI, 1.58-7.51; P =.001) for heavy smokers compared with never-smokers. A significant dose-response relationship was observed (P for trend,.001). When stratified by histological subtype, no obvious impact of smoking was observed among patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma (MEC). In contrast, smoking demonstrated a significantly increased risk of M-SGCs other than MEC, with an OR of 5.15 (95% CI, 2.06-12.87; P<.001) for heavy smokers compared with never-smokers. The authors observed possible heterogeneity with regard to the impact of smoking on risk between MEC and M-SGCs other than MEC (P for heterogeneity,.052). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study demonstrate a significant positive association between cigarette smoking and the risk of M-SGC overall. However, the impact of smoking appeared to be limited to M-SGCs other than MEC.

This study was designed to investigate the exact ratio of remission to progressive or stable cases and analyze the mechanism of tumor regression on the basis of existing theories. Materials and methods: We retrospectively collected images of solitary osteochondromas in patients from 1992 to 2013, excluding cases involving short-term follow-up periods and follow-up periods that ended before growth plate closure. A total of 121 patients were diagnosed and screened for study inclusion. Tumor shrinkage was measured by assessing three points on tumor contours to determine if they had regressed or vanished. Patterns of shrinkage were further divided on the basis of mechanisms described as incorporation, absorption, and fracture. Results: Seventeen patients (mean age at initial diagnosis 13.1?years) met the study inclusion criteria. Tumor morphological classifications were pedunculated (10 cases) and sessile (7 cases). Osteochondroma shrinkage was the most common outcome (8 cases), followed by stable osteochondromas (6 cases), and osteochondromas that had progressed (3 cases). Tumors with sessile morphology were more prone to shrinkage (6 of 7 cases) compared with those of pedunculated morphology (2 of 10 cases; p?=?0.015). Among pedunculated cases, tumor shrinkage was via absorption. The timing of tumor growth cessation was related to the pattern of tumor shrinkage. Absorption mostly followed tumor growth cessation, whereas incorporation mostly preceded tumor growth cessation. Conclusion: The shrinkage of osteochondromas appears less rare than was originally thought. ? 2017, ISS.",Natural history; Osteochondroma; Spontaneous regression,"adolescent; Article; clinical article; controlled study; differential diagnosis; disease course; female; follow up; human; incidental finding; informed consent; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; oncological parameters; osteochondroma; population research; priority journal; remission; retrospective study; solitary osteochondroma; tumor growth; tumor regression; tumor shrinkage; bone tumor; diagnostic imaging; osteochondroma; pathology; Adolescent; Bone Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Osteochondroma; Remission, Spontaneous; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85027831514

This study aimed to evaluate the quality of reporting in articles on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the field of HIV/AIDS. Methods: We searched for original articles on RCTs of ART developed in the field of HIV/AIDS in PubMed database by 5 April 2016. Searched articles were divided into three groups based on the revision year in which the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines were published: Period 1 (1996-2001); Period 2 (2002-2010); and Period 3 (2011-2016). We evaluated the articles using the reporting rates of the 37 items in the CONSORT 2010 checklist, five items in the protocol deviation, and the three items in the ethics. Results: Fifty-two articles were extracted and included in this study. Many of the reporting rates calculated using the CONSORT 2010 checklist showed a significantly increasing trend over the successive periods (65% in Period 1, 67% in Period 2, 79% in Period 3; p < 0.0001). The items with reporting rates < 50% were ""the presence or absence of a protocol change and the reason for such a change,"" ""randomization and blinding,"" and ""where the full trial protocol can be accessed."" Reporting rates of deviations were as low as < 30%, while the reporting rates for patient compliance were the highest (>80% in Period 3) among the five items. The reporting rates for obtaining informed consent and approval by the ethics committee or institutional review board were high (>88%), regardless of the time period assessed. Conclusion: In terms of representative RCT articles in the field of HIV/AIDS, the reporting rate of the items defined by CONSORT was approximately 70%, improving over the successive CONSORT statement revision periods. ? 2017 The Author(s).",ART; CONSORT; HIV/AIDS; Randomized controlled trials; Reporting quality,adult; antiretroviral therapy; checklist; controlled study; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; informed consent; institutional review; Medline; nonhuman; practice guideline; randomization; randomized controlled trial (topic); systematic review; clinical protocol; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; research; standards; antiretrovirus agent; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Checklist; Clinical Protocols; HIV Infections; Humans; Informed Consent; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Report,2-s2.0-85039553333

However, the genetic etiology of CAKUT remains unclear. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) to elucidate the genetic etiology of symptomatic CAKUT and CAKUT accompanied by cryptorchidism. Methods: Three patients with unilateral renal dysplasia accompanied by ipsilateral cryptorchidism were included in this analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, and WES was performed. Disease-specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were determined by comparison with the human genome reference sequence (hg19). Additionally, we searched for SNPs that were common to all three patients, with a particular focus on the coding regions of the target genes. Results: In total, 8710 SNPs were detected. Of the genes harboring these SNPs, 32 associated with renal or testicular development were selected for further analyses. Of these, eight genes (i.e., SMAD4, ITGA8, GRIP1, FREM1, FREM2, TNXB, BMP8B, and SALL1) carried a single amino acid substitution that was common to all three patients. In particular, SNPs in SMAD4 (His290Pro and His291Pro) have not been reported previously in patients with symptomatic CAKUT. Of the candidate genes, four genes (i.e., ITGA8, GRIP1, FREM1, and FREM2) were Fraser syndrome-related genes, encoding proteins that functionally converged on the glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor/RET/bone morphogenic protein (BMP) signaling pathways. As another candidate gene, the protein encoded by BMP8B activates the nuclear translocation of SMAD4, which regulates the expression of genes associated with the differentiation of primordial germ cells or testicular development. Additionally, BMP4, a member of the BMP family, regulates the interaction between metanephric mesenchyme and ureteric buds by suppressing GDNF. Conclusions: Taken together, our findings suggested that the development of the kidney and urinary tract is intimately linked with that of male reproductive organs via BMP/SMAD signaling pathways. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract; Cryptorchidism; Exome sequencing; Renal development,"bone morphogenetic protein; glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor; protein Ret; Smad protein; bone morphogenetic protein; Smad protein; adult; amino acid substitution; Article; BMP8B gene; cell differentiation; child; clinical article; cryptorchism; DNA extraction; Fraser syndrome; FREM1 gene; FREM2 gene; gene; gene activation; gene expression regulation; gene repression; gene targeting; gene translocation; genetic code; GRIP1 gene; human; ITGA8 gene; kidney agenesis; kidney development; male; multicystic dysplastic kidney; preschool child; primordial germ cell; SALL1 gene; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; SMAD4 gene; testis development; TNXB gene; urogenital tract malformation; whole exome sequencing; abnormalities; case report; cryptorchism; diagnostic imaging; genetics; infant; kidney; signal transduction; urinary tract; Adult; Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; Child, Preschool; Cryptorchidism; Humans; Infant; Kidney; Male; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Signal Transduction; Smad Proteins; Urinary Tract",2-s2.0-85036659258

We performed a multicenter retrospective cohort study to investigate the outcome of anti-TNF therapy for internal fistula in Crohn's disease. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from patients with Crohn's disease diagnosed with internal fistula treated with anti-TNF agents (infliximab or adalimumab) between January 2002 and November 2015. Need for surgery and fistula closure were assessed as primary and secondary endpoints. Cumulative rate of surgery was evaluated by the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Prognostic factors for the outcomes were also assessed by univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: A total of 93 Crohn's disease cases were included in the study with a mean follow-up period of 1452.8 days. Fistula locations were entero-entero/colonic (n = 72, 77.4%), enterovesical (n = 16, 17.2%), or enterovaginal (n = 5, 5.4%). Cumulative surgery rate was 47.2%, andfistulaclosure rate was 27.0% at 5 years from the induction of anti-TNF agents. Lower Crohn's Disease Activity Index and shorter duration from the diagnosis of fistula were independently associated with the lower risk of surgery (P = 0.017 and 0.048, respectively). Singlefistulawas associated with the successful fistula closure. Second-line surgical treatments were mostly successful for anti-TNF failures. CONCLUSIONS: In the present retrospective cohort study, approximately half of patients with internal fistulas avoided surgery for long periods. It may be reasonable to treat quiescent single internal fistulas with anti-TNF agents soon after the diagnosis of internal fistulas.

Methods: A total of 177 Japanese patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia were treated with group cognitive behavioural therapy between 2001 and 2015. We examined associations between the change scores in Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire or Body Sensations Questionnaire and the changes in subscales of Symptom Checklist-90 Revised during cognitive behavioural therapy controlling the change in panic disorder severity using multiple regression analysis. Results: Reduction in Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire score was related to a decrease in all Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R) subscale scores. Reduction in Body Sensations Questionnaire score was associated with a decrease in anxiety. Reduction in Panic Disorder Severity Scale score was not related to any SCL-90-R subscale changes. Conclusions: Changes in fear of fear, especially maladaptive cognitions, may predict broad dimensions of psychopathology reductions in patients of panic disorder with agoraphobia over the course of cognitive behavioural therapy.

The prevalence of hypertension during the study period increased with increasing participant age.

The blood pressure of treated hypertensive elderly subjects decreased from 146.1/83.0 to 130.6/75.4 mm Hg, and the reduction was most evident after revision of Japanese Society of Hypertension guidelines regarding target blood pressure in elderly hypertensives. Blood pressure in the entire cohort of elderly subjects decreased from 133.8/78.4 mm Hg in 2001 to 127.9/74.6 mm Hg in 2015. Blood pressure in elderly subjects had decreased over the 15-year study period primarily due to reductions in blood pressure in elderly hypertensive patients on medication. Guidelines for the treatment of hypertension have had a beneficial effect on the management of hypertension in the elderly. Copyright ? 2017 the Author(s).

A 43-year-old man was found dead by his cohabiting mother, lying supine on the floor in his house. He had complained of epigastric discomfort for 1 month, and respiratory symptoms occurred 1 day before his death. He had no history of trauma. Postmortem computed tomography scan revealed the enlarged fluid-filled stomach herniated into the left pleural cavity, compressing the left lung with a mediastinal shift to the right. At autopsy, the left pleural cavity was occupied by herniated abdominal contents with mediastinal shift. The herniation of the stomach, the whole spleen, a portion of the colon, and omentum into the left pleural cavity had occurred through a smooth oval 9 × 5-cm defect in the posterolateral part of the light diaphragm. The stomach was markedly distended and contained 1600 mL of yellowish brown liquid with food residue. Ischemic changes of the herniated organs were not observed. Death was attributed to respiratory failure from abdominal viscera herniation into the left pleural cavity. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

To identify new therapeutic targets for cancers, it is important to clarify the molecular mechanism of induction of EMT. We have previously reported that fad104, a positive regulator of adipocyte differentiation, suppressed the invasion and metastasis of melanoma and breast cancer cells. In this study, we showed that FAD104 functions as a novel suppressor of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β)-mediated EMT in cervical cancer cells. Expression of FAD104 is upregulated during TGF-β-mediated EMT in human cervical cancer HeLa cells. Reduction of fad104 expression enhanced TGF-β-mediated EMT and migration in HeLa cells. Conversely, overexpression of FAD104 suppressed TGF-β-induced EMT. In addition, we showed that FAD104 negatively regulated phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3 but positively regulated phosphorylation of Smad1/5/8 via treatment with TGF-β. These findings demonstrate that FAD104 is a novel suppressor of TGF-β signalling and represses TGF-β-mediated EMT in cervical cancer cells. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,"biological marker; fibronectin; FNDC3B protein, human; Smad protein; transforming growth factor beta; adipogenesis; epithelial mesenchymal transition; female; gene expression; gene knockdown; genetics; HeLa cell line; human; metabolism; signal transduction; tumor cell line; uterine cervix tumor; Adipogenesis; Biomarkers; Cell Line, Tumor; Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition; Female; Fibronectins; Gene Expression; Gene Knockdown Techniques; HeLa Cells; Humans; Signal Transduction; Smad Proteins; Transforming Growth Factor beta; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85035355647

We were concerned that the base plate might be incompatible with Japanese who were generally smaller than Westerners. Therefore, we investigated the dimensions and morphology of the normal Japanese glenoid and compared with the normal French glenoid. Materials and methods One hundred Japanese shoulders without glenoid lesions (50 men and 50 women) were investigated and compared with 100 French shoulders (50 men and 50 women). Computed tomography was performed with 3-dimensional image reconstruction and images were analyzed using Glenosys software. Glenoid parameters (width, height, retroversion and inclination) were compared between Japanese and French subjects. Results In Japanese subjects, the mean glenoid width was 25.5 mm, height was 33.3 mm, retroversion was 2.3° and inclination was 11.6° superiorly. In French subjects, the mean glenoid width was 26.7 mm, height was 35.4 mm, retroversion was 6.0° and inclination was 10.4° superiorly. Glenoid width and height were significantly smaller in Japanese subjects than French subjects (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001), while retroversion was significantly greater in French subjects (P < 0.001). There was no significant difference of inclination. Conclusions These findings will help surgeons to identify suitable patients for RSA and perform the procedure with appropriate preoperative planning.

Methods: We conducted a multicenter case-control study to investigate this potential association. We performed unconditional multiple logistic regression models adjusted by potential confounders.

We also observed a positive association between the number of missing teeth and head and neck cancer risk, with an adjusted OR for ?5 missing teeth compared with &lt;5 missing teeth of 1.49 (95% CI 1.08-2.04). Combining multiple oral hygiene indicators, poor oral hygiene scores increased head and neck cancer risk.

We and others have previously shown that KLF4 is involved in bone modeling and remodeling but roles played by KLF4 during skeletogenesis are still not fully understood. Here, we show that KLF4 is expressed in the epiphyseal growth plate and articular chondrocytes. Most articular chondrocytes expressed KLF4 in embryos but it localized only in a subset of superficial zone cells in postnatal mice. When KLF4 was overexpressed in chondrocytes in vitro, it severely repressed chondrocytic gene expressions. Global gene expression profiling of KLF4-transduced chondrocytes revealed matrix degrading proteinases of the matrix metalloproteinase and disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-1 domain families within the group of upregulated genes. Proteinase induction by KLF4 was alleviated by Trichostatin A treatment suggesting the possible involvement of epigenetic mechanisms on proteinase induction by KLF4.

Stability of HIFs is regulated by multi-step reactions including recognition by the von Hippel-Lindau tumour suppressor protein (pVHL) in association with an E3 ligase complex. Here we show that pVHL physically interacts with fatty acid synthase (FASN), displacing the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. This results in HIF-α protein stabilization and activation of HIF target genes even in normoxia such as during adipocyte differentiation. 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-OH), an inhibitor of FASN expression, also inhibited HIF target gene expression in cultured cells and in mouse liver. Clinically, FASN is frequently upregulated in a broad variety of cancers and has been reported to have an oncogenic function. We found that upregulation of FASN correlated with induction of many HIF target genes, notably in a malignant subtype of prostate tumours. Therefore, pVHL-FASN interaction plays a regulatory role for HIFs and their target gene expression. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85026831332

Liver tissues taken from mice were analyzed by hematoxylin–eosin staining and immunohistochemical methods. Fresh liver cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: We found that female GADD34-deficient mice did not develop obesity or fatty livers. However, female GADD34-deficient mice had infiltrations of myeloid cells in the liver, followed by liver atrophy. Many female GADD34-deficient mice developed hepatocellular carcinoma, whereas female wild-type (WT) mice did not show hepatocellular carcinoma during aging. Female GADD34-deficient mice and female WT mice developed the same percentages of lymphoma. Although a high-fat diet induced a higher level of steatosis in young male GADD34-deficient mice compared with WT mice, a high-fat diet induced the same level of steatosis in young female GADD34-deficient mice compared with WT mice. However, GADD34-deficient female young mice had a higher level of infiltration of myeloid cells and myofibroblasts than WT mice. Conclusions: In contrast to male GADD34-deficient mice, female GADD34-deficient mice did not show obesity as they aged. However, similar to the males, they developed inflammation followed by hepatocellular carcinoma.

NSCs have gained a considerable attention because of their potential application in treatment strategies on the basis of transplantation for neurodegenerative disorders and nerve injuries. Although several signaling pathways have been reportedly involved in the fate determination process of NSCs, the molecular mechanisms underlying the maintenance of neural cell stemness and differentiation process remain largely unknown. Glycoconjugates expressed in the NSC niche in the brain offer markers of NSCs; moreover, they serve as cell regulators, which are actively involved in the modulation of signal transduction. The glycans function on NCS surfaces by recruiting growth factor receptors to specific microdomains as components of glycolipids, thereby mediating the ligand–receptor interactions both indirectly and directly as components of proteoglycans and interacting with specific lectin-type receptors as components of ligand glycoproteins. In this review, we outline current knowledge of the possible functional mechanisms of glycoconjugates to determine cell fates, which are associated with their expression pattern and structural characteristic features. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Differentiation; Glycosylation; Maintenance of stemness; Neural stem cell; Signaling pathway,beta1 integrin; CD24 antigen; chondroitin sulfate; fibroblast growth factor 2; fucosyltransferase; ganglioside GD3; ganglioside GQ 1b; glycoconjugate; glycolipid; glycopeptidase; glycoprotein; glycoprotein gp 130; heparan sulfate; laminin; lectin; lysosome associated membrane protein 1; mitogen activated protein kinase; Notch receptor; protein tyrosine phosphatase; proteoglycan; Ras protein; sonic hedgehog protein; stage specific embryo antigen 1; tenascin; Thy 1 antigen; glycoconjugate; cell differentiation; cell fate; cell surface; cell survival; degenerative disease; human; nerve injury; neural stem cell; priority journal; protein expression; protein glycosylation; protein protein interaction; protein structure; Review; signal transduction; stem cell niche; upregulation; animal; cytology; genetics; metabolism; nervous system development; neural stem cell; Animals; Glycoconjugates; Humans; Neural Stem Cells; Neurogenesis; Signal Transduction,2-s2.0-84976292802

In this study, we investigated the feasibility and the benefit of using the extraperitoneal (EP) approach with six trocars over a 4-cm distance in a flat or 5° Trendelenburg position. We also introduced four new steps to the surgical procedure and compared the surgical results and complications between the EP and TP approach using propensity score matching. Methods: Between August 2012 and August 2016, 200 consecutive patients without any physical restrictions underwent RARP with the EP approach in a less than 5° Trendelenburg position, and 428 consecutive patients underwent RARP with the TP approach in a steep Trendelenburg position. Four new steps to RARP using the EP approach were developed: 1) arranging six trocars; 2) creating the EP space using laparoscopic forceps; 3) holding the separated prostate in the EP space outside the robotic view; and 4) preventing a postoperative inguinal hernia. Clinicopathological results and complications were compared between the EP and TP approaches using propensity score matching. Propensity scores were calculated for each patient using multivariate logistic regression based on the preoperative covariates. Results: All 200 patients safely underwent RARP using the EP approach. The mean volume of estimated blood loss and duration of indwelling urethral catheter use were significantly lower with the EP approach than the TP approach (139.9 vs 184.9 mL, p = 0.03 and 5.6 vs 7.7 days, p < 0.01, respectively). No significant differences in the positive surgical margin were observed. None of the patients developed an inguinal hernia postoperatively after we introduced this technique. Conclusions: The EP approach to RARP was safely performed regardless of patient physique or contraindications to a steep Trendelenburg position. Our method, which involved using the EP approach to perform RARP, can decrease the amount of perioperative blood loss, the duration of indwelling urethral catheter use, and the incidence of postoperative inguinal hernia development. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Extraperitoneal approach; Inguinal hernia; Propensity score; Robot-assisted radical prostatectomy; Small physique; Transperitoneal approach; Trendelenburg position,"prostate specific antigen; adult; aged; analytic method; Article; balloon dilator; cancer staging; controlled study; extraperitoneal approach; five degree Trendelenburg position; Gleason score; human; inguinal hernia; intermethod comparison; Japanese (people); lymph node dissection; major clinical study; male; medical history; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; patient positioning; patient safety; postoperative complication; propensity score matching; prostate cancer; robot-assisted prostatectomy; selection bias; steep Trendelenburg position; surgical approach; transperitoneal approach; treatment contraindication; clinical trial; comparative study; devices; feasibility study; head-down tilt; inguinal hernia; Japan; middle aged; postoperative complication; procedures; propensity score; prostate tumor; prostatectomy; retrospective study; robotic surgical procedure; statistical model; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Contraindications, Procedure; Feasibility Studies; Head-Down Tilt; Hernia, Inguinal; Humans; Japan; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Postoperative Complications; Propensity Score; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures",2-s2.0-85034769639

The aim of this study was to summarize the integration process for patients’ perceptions into the development of CPG for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) management in Japan. Methods: We used a mixed-methods approach. Questionnaires that could be self-administered were mailed to 2222 RA patients randomly selected from the Japan Rheumatism Friendship Association (JRFA) membership list that was age- and prefecture-stratified. A focus group with five JRFA executive members was formed to verify the results of the questionnaire. Results: A total of 1470 patients aged 20–79 years old returned the questionnaire. Analysis of the questionnaire data revealed that the topics selected by the CPG task force met the patients’ needs. The focus group participants showed reluctance to use the term ‘preference’ because patients would not want to take any medications but would have to take them out of necessity. Conclusions: We confirmed that the new CPG successfully addressed clinical issues that were important to both rheumatologists and patients. Clinicians should understand patients’ reluctance to take medications and explain the role of each medication well to increase adherence. ? 2017 Japan College of Rheumatology.,clinical practice guidelines; focus group; patients’ perspectives; questionnaire survey; Rheumatoid arthritis,"corticosteroid; disease modifying antirheumatic drug; methotrexate; antirheumatic agent; adult; aged; arthrotomy; Article; consensus development; daily life activity; doctor patient relation; expectation; female; health service; human; information processing; Japan; major clinical study; male; mental health; patient preference; patient satisfaction; perception; practice guideline; priority journal; rehabilitation center; rheumatoid arthritis; rheumatologist; attitude to health; middle aged; patient; psychology; rheumatoid arthritis; Adult; Aged; Antirheumatic Agents; Arthritis, Rheumatoid; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Patients; Perception; Practice Guidelines as Topic",2-s2.0-85010699635

The main objective of this study was to show that axial four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) could visualize bilateral protrusive condylar movement directly. We used axial 4DCT images to assess condylar protrusion in patients who underwent mandibular reconstruction. Methods We enrolled seven healthy volunteers (median age 30 years, range 27–38 years) and seven patients (median age 65 years, range 52–80 years), who underwent mandibulectomy (segmental in five, hemi in one, marginal in one) and free flap reconstruction (using the fibula in six and the radial forearm in one). Six study subjects were instructed to masticate a cookie during the 4DCT scan (the seventh made chewing motions). The distance between the most anterior and posterior positions of the bilateral condyles on 4DCT (axial view) images was then measured and compared between controls and patients using the Mann–Whitney U-test. Results The crosswise difference in the distances of condylar protrusion was significantly greater in patients than in the controls. Conclusion Axial 4DCT images can visualize a bilateral condylar protrusive path.

In the present study, we investigated the mechanism behind the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced migration of osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells, and the effect of resveratrol on this cell migration. Methods: The cell migration was examined using Boyden chamber, and phosphorylation of each kinase was analyzed by Western blotting. Results: The EGF-induced migration was suppressed by PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK1/2, as well as SB203580, an inhibitor of p38 MAP kinase, SP600125, an inhibitor of SAPK/JNK, and deguelin, an inhibitor of Akt. In contrast, rapamycin, an inhibitor of upstream kinase of p70 S6 kinase, and fasudil, an inhibitor of Rho-kinase, hardly affected the migration. Resveratrol significantly reduced the EGF-induced migration in a dose-dependent manner. SRT1720, an SIRT1 activator, suppressed the migration by EGF. In addition, resveratrol markedly attenuated the EGF-induced phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK and Akt without affecting the phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase or p38 MAP kinase. The phosphorylation of SAPK/JNK and Akt induced by EGF was down-regulated by SRT1720. Conclusion: Our results strongly suggest that resveratrol reduces the EGF-stimulated migration of osteoblasts via suppression of SAPK and Akt, and that the inhibitory effect of resveratrol is mediated in part via SIRT1. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Akt; EGF; Migration; Osteoblast; Resveratrol; SAPK/JNK,"2 (2 amino 3 methoxyphenyl)chromone; 4 (4 fluorophenyl) 2 (4 methylsulfinylphenyl) 5 (4 pyridyl)imidazole; anthra[1,9 cd]pyrazol 6(2h) one; deguelin; epidermal growth factor; fasudil; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 2; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; n [2 [3 (1 piperazinylmethyl)imidazo[2,1 b]thiazol 6 yl]phenyl] 2 quinoxalinecarboxamide; protein kinase B; protein p42; protein p44; rapamycin; resveratrol; Rho kinase; S6 kinase; sirtuin 1; stress activated protein kinase; 2-(2-amino-3-methoxyphenyl)-4H-1-benzopyran-4-one; anthracene derivative; epidermal growth factor; flavonoid; fused heterocyclic rings; imidazole derivative; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; pyrazolanthrone; pyridine derivative; resveratrol; Rho kinase; sirtuin 1; stilbene derivative; stress activated protein kinase; animal cell; Article; cell migration; concentration response; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme inhibition; enzyme phosphorylation; MC3T3-E1 cell line; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; osteoblast; priority journal; Western blotting; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; cell culture; cell motion; cytology; drug effects; MAPK signaling; metabolism; osteoblast; phosphorylation; Animals; Anthracenes; Cell Movement; Cells, Cultured; Epidermal Growth Factor; Flavonoids; Heterocyclic Compounds, 4 or More Rings; Imidazoles; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Mice; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Osteoblasts; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphorylation; Pyridines; rho-Associated Kinases; Sirtuin 1; Stilbenes",2-s2.0-85030712676

In the present study, the effects of EGCG and CGA on PGF2α-stimulated OPG synthesis in MC3T3-E1 cells were investigated. EGCG significantly upregulated PGF2α-stimulated OPG release, whereas CGA did not affect OPG release. The PGF2α-induced expression level of OPG mRNA was enhanced by EGCG. Regarding the intracellular signaling underlying the effect of EGCG, EGCG failed to affect PGF2α-stimulated phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAPK, p38 MAPK or SAPK/JNK. EGCG by itself markedly induced the phosphorylation of p44/p42 MAP kinase for up to 10 min and the status decreased subsequently, whereas EGCG did not significantly affect the phosphorylation status of p38 MAPK or SAPK/JNK within 60 min. These results indicated that EGCG, but not CGA amplifies the PGF2α-stimulated OPG synthesis in osteoblasts.",(-)-epigallocatechin gallate; Chlorogenic acid; Osteoblast; Osteoprotegerin; Prostaglandin F2α,"chlorogenic acid; epigallocatechin gallate; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; osteoprotegerin; prostaglandin F2 alpha; protein p42; protein p44; stress activated protein kinase; catechin; chlorogenic acid; epigallocatechin gallate; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; osteoprotegerin; prostaglandin F2 alpha; stress activated protein kinase 1; Tnfrsf11b protein, mouse; animal cell; animal tissue; Article; bone remodeling; controlled study; drug synthesis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; intracellular signaling; mediator; mouse; newborn; nonhuman; osteoblast; protein phosphorylation; protein secretion; upregulation; agonists; analogs and derivatives; animal; cell line; cytology; drug effect; drug potentiation; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; osteoblast; phosphorylation; signal transduction; Animals; Catechin; Cell Line; Chlorogenic Acid; Dinoprost; Drug Synergism; Gene Expression Regulation; Mice; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 8; Osteoblasts; Osteoprotegerin; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phosphorylation; RNA, Messenger; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85030128721

Methods: Subjects recruited from April 2013 to December 2015 underwent a targeted NGS analysis, including JAG1 and Notch homolog 2 (NOTCH2). If no mutations were detected in JAG1 or NOTCH2, or if copy number variations were suggested by the NGS analysis, we performed an MLPA analysis of JAG1. We also performed a microarray CGH analysis with whole-exon deletion detected by the MLPA analysis. Results: We analysed 30 subjects with Alagille syndrome, nine with incomplete Alagille syndrome and 17 with biliary atresia and detected pathogenic mutations in JAG1 or NOTCH2 in 24/30 subjects with Alagille syndrome and in 4/9 subjects with incomplete Alagille syndrome. No pathogenic mutations were detected in subjects with biliary atresia. The frequency of JAG1 mutations was as follows: single nucleotide variants (51.9%), small insertion or deletion (29.6%) and gross deletion (18.5%).

The aim of this study was to elucidate the relationship between members of the Notch family and oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tumorigenesis, with a focus on epigenetic alteration, especially DNA methylation. Material and methods We analyzed the expression and DNA methylation of members of the Notch family in six OSCC cell lines. Additionally, we evaluated the DNA methylation level and the frequency of Notch3 methylation in clinical samples and compared the results between tumor and normal tissues using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) dataset. Further, we comprehensively evaluated DNA methylation and gene mutation of Notch3 in tumor tissues. Results Notch1, Notch2, and Notch4 were substantially expressed in all the OSCC cells, whereas Notch3 expression was not detected; moreover, Notch3 was highly methylated at the promoter region in one of the six cell lines. In the OSCC clinical samples, Notch3 methylation was significantly higher in tumor than in normal tissues (P = 0.04). Intriguingly, DNA methylation and loss of function mutation of Notch3 tended to be mutually exclusive. Conclusion Our data indicate that Notch3 is downregulated by multiple mechanisms during OSCC tumorigenesis, mainly due to DNA methylation. ? 2017 Asian AOMS, ASOMP, JSOP, JSOMS, JSOM, and JAMI",DNA methylation; Notch3; Oral squamous cell carcinoma,,2-s2.0-85023631574

Although these 2 SNPs, rs8099917 and rs12979860, have established their significant roles in the innate immunity response to spontaneously clear HCV in patients with AHC, the detailed mechanisms of their roles remain largely unknown. Aim: This study is aimed at clarifying the factors affecting IFNL3 production and assessing the roles of IFNL3 in AHC. Materials and Methods: A total of 21 AHC patients who visited the hospital within 10 days after symptom onset were assessed. As controls, 23 healthy volunteers (HVs) were examined. Serum IFNL3 levels were quantified using an in-house, IFNL3-specific chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) kit. Serum IFNL1, IFN-α, IFN-β, and IFN-γ induced protein-10 (IP-10) levels were assayed using commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. Results: At baseline, serum IFNL3 levels were higher in AHC patients than in HVs (p < 0.0001). The higher levels in AHC patients did not differ between patients with the rs8099917 TT genotype and those with the non-TT (TG/GG) genotype (p = 0.546). Serial measurement of serum IFNL3 levels did not predict the outcome of conventional AHC. However, serum IFNL3 levels at baseline correlated positively with the HCV RNA levels (p = 0.005). Following HCV eradication, serum IFNL3 levels reduced to within the range obtained for HVs. Baseline serum IFNL1 levels did not differ significantly between AHC patients and HVs (p = 0.284). Serum levels of IFNL1 and IFNL3 at baseline also showed no correlative power (p = 0.288). Serum IFN-α and IFN-β were detected together with remarkably high serum IFNL3 levels in only one patient who progressed to acute liver failure (ALF). Conclusion: These findings indicate that serum IFNL3 levels at baseline are higher in AHC patients regardless of the rs8099917 polymorphism, and primary HCV infection triggers the production of IFNL3. As a first line of defense in the innate immune system against invading HCV, increased IFNL3 levels play an important role, but serum IFNL3 levels are not the principal determinant of the clinical course of conventional AHC. ? 2017 S.

We compared the acute effect of ST-EX on lowering postprandial hyperglycemia with that of constant bicycle exercise (BI-EX) performed at the same heart rate (HR). Research design and methods Seven people with type 2 diabetes and seven with impaired glucose tolerance volunteered for this study. The step rate for ST-EX and work rate for BI-EX were individually determined to correspond to high-moderate to low-vigorous intensity (HR ~130 beats per minute). For the ST-EX trial, the subjects performed 16 repetitions of walking down one flight of stairs followed by climbing up to the starting point (~8 min in duration) 90 min after consuming a test meal. For the BI-EX trial, the subjects performed a constant pedaling exercise for the same duration at the same time after the meal. Results The reduction in blood glucose (BG) level between 90 and 105 min after a meal was significantly greater for ST-EX (–4.0±0.7mmol/L) than for BI-EX (–2.7±0.9mmol/L). The net reduction in BG between 90 and 105 min was also significantly greater for ST-EX (–3.2±0.7mmol/L) than for BI-EX (–2.0±0.6mmol/L). Serum insulin levels did not differ between the groups. Oxygen consumption for ST-EX was higher than that for BI-EX, but the blood lactate level and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) for ST-EX were lower than those for BI-EX. Conclusions Compared with BI-EX performed at the same HR, ST-EX more rapidly decreased postprandial BG level with lower blood lactate and RER responses. A short bout of ST-EX may be clinically useful to acutely ameliorate BG levels after meals. ? Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2017.

Objective: We aimed to evaluate transglucosidase treatment efficacy for bowel movements in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to clarify the relationship between bowel movements, dietary habits, gut microbiota and fecal short-chain fatty acids. Methods: In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 66 patients received placebo or transglucosidase (300 or 900 mg/day) orally, for 12 weeks. Fecal bacterial communities and short-chain fatty acids were analyzed before and after the treatment. Results: Transglucosidase treatment significantly (p < 0.05) affected fecal microbiota (Prevotella spp., Bacteroides spp., Bifidobacterium spp., and Clostridium subcluster XIVa) and fecal short-chain fatty acid (acetate, valerate, succinate and lactate) content. Clostridium cluster IV, Clostridium subcluster XIVa, Clostridium cluster XVIII and fecal pH increased significantly and order Lactobacillales decreased in patients with bowel movement disorder compared with controls.

This would suggest narrow spectrum antibiotics could still be an effective treatment for uncomplicated cystitis despite this era of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study was thus to evaluate the rates of antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates cultured from uncomplicated cystitis cases that presented to the Urology Department of a community hospital in Japan. We evaluated the efficacy of cefaclor, a narrow spectrum antibiotic, for uncomplicated cystitis. We further compared the rates of antimicrobial susceptibility of isolates from uncomplicated cystitis cases to those reported in a hospital-wide antibiogram. A retrospective chart review was performed of patients diagnosed with uncomplicated cystitis in the Urology Department. The patients were mainly treated orally by cefaclor at 750 mg/day for seven days. Significantly greater susceptibilities to cefazolin (87.0% vs 65.7%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (89.4% vs 79.1%) and levofloxacin (84.6% vs 66.9%) were observed in a cystitis antibiogram for Escherichia coli compared with a hospital-wide antibiogram. The clinical efficacy of cefaclor for acute cystitis was also demonstrated. The greater susceptibility of Escherichia coli to antimicrobials observed in this study supports the hypothesis that antimicrobial susceptibility rates in uncomplicated cystitis cases that present to the Urology Department would be greater than those reported in the hospital antibiogram. Therefore, uncomplicated acute cystitis can be treated by narrow spectrum antibiotics such as cefaclor even in this ‘‘antimicrobial resistance era’’. ? 2017 Japanese Society of Chemotherapy and The Japanese Association for Infectious Diseases",Antibiogram; Cefaclor; Cystitis; Escherichia coli,"amikacin; ampicillin; aztreonam; beta lactamase; cefaclor; cefazolin; cefdinir; cefepime; cefixime; cefmetazole; cefotaxime; cefpodoxime proxetil; ceftazidime; ciprofloxacin; clavulanic acid; cotrimoxazole; gentamicin; imipenem; latamoxef; levofloxacin; meropenem; minocycline; piperacillin; piperacillin plus tazobactam; sulfamethoxazole; sultamicillin; trimethoprim; antiinfective agent; cotrimoxazole; levofloxacin; adult; aged; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; Citrobacter koseri; clinical outcome; community hospital; comparative study; Corynebacterium; cystitis; diarrhea; disease course; drug efficacy; Enterobacter cloacae; Enterococcus faecalis; Escherichia coli; female; human; Japan; Japanese (people); Klebsiella; major clinical study; Morganella morganii; nonhuman; practice guideline; prescription; Proteus; rash; retrospective study; Staphylococcus; Streptococcus; treatment outcome; treatment response; vagina candidiasis; acute disease; community hospital; cystitis; drug effect; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; middle aged; procedures; urology; very elderly; young adult; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Infective Agents; Cystitis; Escherichia coli; Female; Hospitals, Community; Humans; Japan; Levofloxacin; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Trimethoprim, Sulfamethoxazole Drug Combination; Urology; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85028313870

It frequently causes acute and chronic peripheral neuropathies, such as cold allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia. Ninjin’yoeito (NYT) is a formula used in traditional Japanese Kampo medicine to improve recovery from diseases and other medical disorders. We previously reported that treatment with a boiling-water extract of NYT prevented L-OHP-induced damage to neurite-like outgrowths from differentiated PC12 cells. The objectives of the present study were to evaluate the in vivo effects of NYT on L-OHP-induced neuropathic pain in mice and identify the active ingredients in NYT. Treatment with NYT extract significantly ameliorated both cold allodynia and mechanical hyperalgesia induced by L-OHP. While L-OHP treatment suppressed neurite outgrowths from primary dorsal root ganglion cells in vitro, NYT extract blocked this suppression in a concentration-dependent manner. Among the herbal components of NYT, the extract of ginseng (Panax ginseng roots) showed a protective effect against neurite damage induced by L-OHP, and one of its active ingredients was identified as ginsenoside Rg3. Ginseng extract partially relieved L-OHP-induced neuropathic pain in mice. Our results suggest that NYT could be an attractive agent for treating L-OHP-induced neuropathic pain, and that the active ingredient of NYT may be ginseng. ? 2017, The Japanese Society of Pharmacognosy and Springer Japan KK.",Ginsenoside Rg3; Neuropathy; Ninjin’yoeito; Oxaliplatin; Root of Panax ginseng,"ginseng extract; ginsenoside Rg 3; ninjin' yoeito extract; plant extract; unclassified drug; oxaliplatin; platinum complex; allodynia; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cold allodynia; cold allodynia; concentration response; controlled study; experimental neuropathic pain; ginseng; herbal medicine; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mechanical hyperalgesia; mouse; neurite outgrowth; neuroprotection; ninjin yoeito; nonhuman; oxaliplatin induced neuropathic pain; oxaliplatin induced neuropathic pain; sensory nerve cell; animal; chemically induced; chemistry; Kampo medicine; neuralgia; Panax; procedures; Animals; Male; Medicine, Kampo; Mice; Neuralgia; Organoplatinum Compounds; Panax",2-s2.0-85022218279

Thus, we examined associations between macronutrient intakes and serum oestrogen with consideration of polymorphisms in oestrogen-metabolising genes. In this cross-sectional study, 784 naturally menopaused Japanese women aged 47-69 years were selected from participants of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. We documented dietary intakes, measured serum concentrations of oestrone (E1) and oestradiol (E2) and genotyped polymorphisms in oestrogen-metabolising CYP19A1 (rs4441215 and rs936306) and HSD17B1 (rs605059) genes. Trends and interactions were examined using linear regression models. In addition, we calculated the ratios of the oestrogen concentrations of the second to the highest quartiles (Q2-Q4) of dietary intake to those of the lowest quartiles (Q1). After adjustment for potential confounders, E2 was significantly associated with intake of carbohydrate and noodles; ratios of Q4 v. Q1 were 1·15 (95 % CI 1·04, 1·28) and 1·15 (95 % CI 1·04, 1·26), respectively. In contrast, E2 levels were inversely associated with intake of total energy, SFA and n-3 highly unsaturated fatty acids (n-3 HUFA); ratios of Q4 v. Q1 were 0·90 (95 % CI 0·82, 0·99), 0·89 (95 % CI 0·81, 0·98) and 0·91 (95 % CI 0·83, 1·00), respectively. In stratified analysis by polymorphisms, the rs605059 genotype of HSD17B1 significantly modified associations of E2 with intake of n-3 HUFA and fish; the associations were limited to those with the CC genotype. Macronutrient intakes were associated with serum E2 level, and these associations may be modified by HSD17B1 polymorphism in postmenopausal women. Copyright ?

Consequently, variations of heartbeat scaling properties have been associated with the dynamical balancing of nonlinear sympathetic/vagal activity. Nevertheless, whether vagal dynamics has multifractal properties yet alone is currently unknown. In this study, we answer this question by conducting multifractal analysis through wavelet leader-based multiscale representations of instantaneous series of vagal activity as estimated from inhomogeneous point process models. Experimental tests were performed on data gathered from 57 CHF patients, aiming to investigate the automatic recognition accuracy in predicting survivor and non-survivor patients after a 4 years follow up.

Objective indices were applied to evaluate the usefulness of a moisturizer against skin exsiccation associated with the use of EGFR inhibitors in cancer patients. Patients and methods: Patients with either colorectal or head and neck cancer treated with either cetuximab or panitumumab were randomly assigned 1:2 to the prophylactic-treatment arm, where participants received prophylactical moisturizer treatment (heparinoid preparation, Hirudoid?), or to the symptomatic-treatment arm, where moisturizer was applied after the onset of cutaneous symptoms. Patients were observed for 6 weeks after the start of the administration of EGFR inhibitor. Results: A total of 15 patients were included and assessed: 6 in the prophylactic treatment group and 9 in the symptomatic treatment group. We evaluated the effect of EGFR inhibitors on the physiologic function of the skin. Administration of EGFR inhibitors resulted in a continued reduction in the moisture content of the horny layer and a decrease in cutaneous sebum levels. Skin observation revealed frequent development of an acneiform rash and significantly higher exsiccation and exfoliation scores. Administration of EGFR inhibitor was associated with a decrease in the horny layer moisture content and lower cutaneous sebum levels in the symptomatic treatment group. In contrast, levels of both the indicators were increased in the prophylactic treatment group. Moreover, the EGFR inhibitor-associated increase in exsiccation and exfoliation scores were minimized in the prophylactic treatment group relative to the symptomatic treatment group. Conclusion: Application of a moisturizer is effective against dry skin induced by the administration of an EGFR inhibitor. ? 2017 Watanabe et al.",Colorectal cancer; EGFR inhibitor; Head and neck cancer; Heparinoid preparation; Moisturizer; Prophylactical moisturizer treatment; Skin exsiccation,cetuximab; hirudoid; minocycline; panitumumab; acne; adult; Article; clinical article; colorectal cancer; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; drug efficacy; drug safety; female; head and neck cancer; human; male; moisture; randomized controlled trial; sebum; skin disease; skin exfoliation; time to treatment; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85029375497

In Japan, the protocol of 48Gy in 4 fractions over 4days has been most often employed, but higher doses may be necessary to control large tumors. Previously, we conducted a clinical study using SBRT for stage I NSCLC employing different doses depending on tumor diameter, which was closed in 2008. Thereafter, a new study employing higher doses has been conducted, which is reported here. The purpose of this study was to review the safety and effectiveness of the higher doses. Methods: We escalated the total dose for the improvement of local control for large tumors. In this study, 71 patients underwent SBRT between December 2008 and April 2014. Isocenter doses of 48, 50, and 52Gy were administered for tumors with a longest diameter of <1.5cm, 1.5-3cm, and >3cm, respectively. It was recommended to cover 95% of the PTV with at least 90% of the isocenter dose, and in all but one cases, 95% of the PTV received at least 80% of the prescribed dose. Treatments were delivered in 4 fractions, giving 2 fractions per week. SBRT was performed with 6-MV photons using 4 non-coplanar and 3 coplanar beams. Results: The median follow-up period was 44months for all patients and 61months for living patients. Overall survival (OS) was 65%, progression-free survival (PFS) was 55%, and cumulative incidence of local recurrence (LR) was 15% at 5years. The 5-year OS was 69% for 57 stage IA patients and 53% for 14 stage IB patients (p=0.44). The 5-year PFS was 55 and 54%, respectively (p=0.98). The 5-year cumulative incidence of LR was 11 and 31%, respectively (p=0.09). The cumulative incidence of Grade?2 radiation pneumonitis was 25%. Conclusions: Our newer SBRT study yielded reasonable local control and overall survival and acceptable toxicity, but escalating the total dose did not lead to improved outcomes.

Oral lichen planus (OLP) is one such extrahepatic manifestation of HCV infection. Recently, direct-acting antivirals (DAA) have proved to be highly effective and safe for the eradication of HCV. Herein, we report a case of OLP accompanied by HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) that disappeared after liver transplantation and achievement of sustained virological response following interferon (IFN)-free treatment with ledipasvir (LDV) and sofosbuvir (SOF). The 50-year-old patient developed erosive OLP during IFN therapy, with hyperthyroidism at 53 years of age and HCC at 55 years. He received immunosuppressive drugs and IFN-free DAA treatment after liver transplantation at 60 years of age, which led to disappearance of the symptoms of OLP. The patient was treated safely and effectively with LDV/SOF, although it is not known whether the disappearance of OLP resulted from the eradication of HCV or the immunosuppressive therapy. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Direct-acting antivirals; Extrahepatic manifestations; Hepatitis C virus; Interferon; Liver transplantation; Oral lichen planus,antivirus agent; dexaltin oral ointment; entecavir; glycyrrhizic acid; interferon; ledipasvir; ledipasvir plus sofosbuvir; mycophenolate mofetil; peginterferon; prednisolone; ribavirin; sofosbuvir; stronger neo minophagen C; tacrolimus; adult; Article; case report; cheilitis; chronic hepatitis; clinical article; clinical examination; computer assisted tomography; echography; Hepatitis C virus; human; hyperthyroidism; immunosuppressive treatment; Japanese (people); lichen planus; liver cell carcinoma; liver transplantation; lower lip; male; middle aged; mouth lesion; priority journal,2-s2.0-85035797354

Despite endourologists researching urinary stone disease using endoscopes to collect tissue, this tissue collection method is limited. Endoscopically removed tissues are small in size, restricting the types of genome-based examination possible. We investigated a new method of renal papilla biopsy and RNA extraction to establish a genomic research methodology for kidney stone disease. Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective multi-institutional study and collected renal papilla specimens from consecutive percutaneous nephrolithotomy and ureteroscopy (URS) cases performed for removal of upper urinary tract stones. Renal papilla tissue was extracted using ureteroscopic biopsy forceps after stone removal. RNA was extracted using two different extraction kits, and their quantity and quality were examined. Additionally, the impact of biopsy on surgical complications was compared between cases performed with and without biopsy by matched case-control analysis adjusted for age, gender, body mass index, bilaterality, and stone burden. Results: A total of 90 biopsies from 49 patients were performed, and the median duration between specimen collection and RNA extraction was 61 days. Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed BIGopsy? forceps usage significantly increased the total yield (p = 0.004) and quality (p = 0.001 for A260/280, p = 0.004 for A260/A230) of extracted RNA. Extraction using the RNeasy Micro Kit? also improved A260/A230, whereas reduced RNA integrity number of extracted RNA by univariate and multivariate analyses (p = 0.002 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). Moreover, matched case-control study demonstrated that endoscopic renal papilla biopsy caused no significant surgical complications, including bleeding, decreased stone clearance and hematocrit, and renal dysfunction. Biopsies during URS imparted an average of 20 minutes of procedure time over nonbiopsy cases. Conclusions: We demonstrate a safe methodology for optimal RNA extraction of renal papilla tissue. This technique will accelerate advanced genomic studies for kidney stone formers by facilitating larger tissue yields. ?

This study investigated the advantages of this system compared with the conventional circular collimator (CC) system. Dosimetric comparisons of MLC and CC plans were carried out. First, to investigate suitable target sizes for the MLC mode, MLC and CC plans were generated using computed tomography (CT) images from 5 patients for 1, 3, 5 and 7 cm diameter targets. Second, MLC and CC plans were compared in 10 patients, each with liver and prostate targets. For brain targets, doses to the brain could be spared in MLC plans better than in CC plans (P . 0.02). The MLC mode also achieved more uniform dose delivery to the targets. The conformity index in MLC plans was stable, irrespective of the target size (P = 0.5). For patients with liver tumors, the MLC mode achieved higher target coverage than the CC mode (P = 0.04). For prostate tumors, doses to the rectum and the conformity index were lowered in MLC plans compared with in CC plans (P . 0.04). In all target plans, treatment times in MLC plans were shorter than those in CC plans (P > 0.001). The newly introduced MLC technology can reduce treatment time and provide favorable or comparable dose distribution for 1.7 cm targets. In particular, the MLC mode has dosimetric advantage for targets near organs at risk. Therefore, the MLC mode is recommended as the first option in stereotactic body radiotherapy. ? 2017 The Author.",circular collimator; cyberknife; intracranial tumor; liver cancer; Multileaf collimator; prostate cancer,"brain; comparative study; human; liver; male; multivariate analysis; organ size; pathology; procedures; prostate; radiation response; radiometry; radiosurgery; Brain; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Humans; Liver; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Organ Size; Prostate; Radiometry; Radiosurgery",2-s2.0-85032433586

Methods: This study evaluated 14 patients who underwent thoracoscopic lobectomy after previously undergoing contralateral lobectomy at a single institution between 2008 and 2015. Results: Among 14 patients who had previously received contralateral lobectomy, 4 were unable to maintain sufficient perioperative oxygenation with usual one-lung ventilation. The predicted pulmonary function before surgery in these patients was as follows: both (I) predicted postoperative forced expiratory volume in 1 second &lt; 800 mL/m2; and (II) ?5 contralateral residual segments for ventilation. Regarding special oxygenation techniques, two underwent selective ventilation using lobe-selective bronchial blockade, one underwent intermittent positive airway pressure for operative side lung, and one underwent highfrequency jet ventilation for operative residual lobe. Conclusions: When performing thoracoscopic lobectomy in patients with a history of contralateral lobectomy, a careful evaluation of the preoperative pulmonary function is needed. ?

However, the in vivo integrated metabolism of its multiple components and the active chemical constituents of Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang remain unknown. In this study, a method using ultra high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry was established for the detection and identification of the metabolites in human and rat urine after oral administration of Xiao-Qing-Long-Tang. A total of 19 compounds were detected or tentatively identified in human urine samples, including eight prototypes and 11 metabolites. Also, a total of 50 compounds were detected or tentatively identified in rat urine samples, including 15 prototypes and 35 metabolites detected with either a highly sensitive extracted ion chromatogram method or the MSE determination using Mass Fragment software. Our results indicated that phase Ⅱ reactions (e.g. glucuronidation and sulfation) were the main metabolic pathways of flavones, while phase I reactions (e.g. demethylation and hydroxylation) were the major metabolic reaction for alkaloids, lignans, and ginger essential oil.

In our clinical experience, we have noted that many patients with unilateral idiopathic clubfoot developed significant flatfoot in the contralateral foot during brace treatment. The purpose of this study was to investigate the natural history of the contralateral foot development during and after brace wear. We also discuss the effect of the FAB on the contralateral foot. We retrospectively reviewed 21 contralateral feet of 21 patients with unilateral idiopathic clubfoot who were treated using the Ponseti method and were conservatively followed up until the FAB was taken off (6 years of age or older). We evaluated flatfoot indicators of the contralateral foot on standing radiographs during and after brace wear and compared them against the normal reference ranges. We also evaluated the changes in the flatfoot indicators of the contralateral foot during and after brace wear. Although there was a significant difference in the flatfoot indicators between the contralateral foot and normal reference ranges during brace wear, there was no significant difference in the flatfoot indicators after brace wear. While there was no significant improvement in flatfoot indicators of the contralateral foot during brace wear, there was a significant improvement or a trend to improve after brace wear. There was no significant correlation between the contralateral flatfoot and original joint laxity. Significant flatfoot deformity was observed in the contralateral foot during brace wear. The contralateral flatfoot persisted during brace wear and improved to within normal reference ranges after brace wear. Our findings suggest that the FAB may influence the development of the contralateral foot, leading to the flatfoot. ? 2017 the Author(s).

Especially, this treatment might become an alternative definitive treatment for early and advanced breast cancer in patients who refuse any type of surgery. The purpose of this study was to investigate the biological effects and appropriate combination methods of irradiation and H2O2 in vivo. SCCVII tumor cells transplanted into the legs of C3H/HeN mice were used. Chronological changes of intratumoral distribution of oxygen bubbles after injection of H2O2 were investigated using computed tomography. The effects of H2O2 alone and in combination with single or five-fraction irradiation were investigated using a growth delay assay. The optimal timing of H2O2 injection was investigated. Immunostaining of tumors was performed using the hypoxia marker pimonidazole. Oxygen bubbles decreased gradually and almost disappeared after 24 h. Administration of H2O2 produced 2–3 days’ tumor growth delay. Tumor regrowth was slowed further when H2O2 was injected before irradiation. The group irradiated immediately after H2O2 injection showed the longest tumor growth delay. Dose-modifying factors were 1.7–2.0 when combined with single irradiation and 1.3–1.5 with fractionated irradiation. Pimonidazole staining was weaker in tumors injected with H2O2. H2O2 injection alone had modest antitumor effects. Greater tumor growth delays were demonstrated by combining irradiation and H2O2 injection. The results of the present study could serve as a basis for evaluating results of various clinical studies on this treatment. ? 2017 The Authors.

It has been previously demonstrated that resveratrol exerts its biological effects primarily via sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) activation. We previously reported that triiodothyronine (T3) induces osteocalcin synthesis in osteoblast-like MC3T3-E1 cells, and that p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase mediates the T3-stimulated synthesis of osteocalcin. The present study investigated the effect of resveratrol on T3-induced osteocalcin synthesis and its underlying mechanism in MC3T3-E1 cells. Cultured cells were stimulated with T3, and osteocalcin release from MC3T3-E1 cells was measured by ELISA and phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase was analyzed by western blotting. Resveratrol significantly suppressed the release of osteocalcin stimulated by T3, and SRT1720, a SIRT1 activator, significantly reduced T3-induced osteocalcin release. The expression level of osteocalcin mRNA stimulated by T3 was significantly attenuated by resveratrol and T3-induced transactivation activity of the thyroid hormone-responsive element was significantly diminished by resveratrol. However, only limited effects of resveratrol on the T3-induced phosphorylation of p38 MAP kinase were observed. The results of the present study demonstrated that resveratrol suppresses T3-stimulated osteocalcin synthesis at a point upstream of transcription in osteoblasts, and that the inhibitory effect of resveratrol is mediated, at least partially, through SIRT1 activation.

In the present study four specific polyclonal antibodies against ATBF1 were generated, and the expression and intracellular localization of ATBF1 in colonic mucosae, polyps, adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissue samples were investigated. The four polyclonal antibodies produced were as follows: MB34 and MB49, which recognize the N-and C-terminal fragments of ATBF1, respectively; and D1-120 and MB44, which recognize the middle fragments of ATBF1 that contain three nuclear localization signals (NLS). In total, 191 colon samples were examined by immunohistochemical analysis. In addition, colon cancer cells were transfected with four ATBF1 expression vectors, and the subcellular localization of each fragment was examined. Normal colon mucosal cells were not observed to express ATBF1. However, a small number of hyperplastic polyps, serrated adenomas and tubular adenomas expressed ATBF1. Colon cancer cells were observed to express D1-120-and MB44-reactive middle fragments of ATBF1 in their cell nuclei. However, the N-and C-terminal fragments of ATBF1 did not translocate to the nucleus. Transfection of ATBF1 fragments revealed cleavage of the ATBF1 protein and nuclear translocation of the cleaved middle portion containing the NLS. A positive correlation between the cytoplasmic localization of the N-and C-termini of ATBF1, nuclear localization of the middle portion of ATBF1 and malignant cancer cell invasion was observed. In conclusion, the results of the present study suggest that alterations in the expression and subcellular localization of ATBF1, as a result of post-transcriptional modifications, are associated with malignant features of colon tumours.",AT motif binding factor 1; Colon cancer; Nuclear localization signals; Transcription factor,"AT motif binding factor 1; transcription factor; unclassified drug; homeodomain protein; ZFHX3 protein, human; amino terminal sequence; Article; carboxy terminal sequence; cellular distribution; colloid carcinoma; colon adenocarcinoma; colon adenoma; colon mucosa; colon polyposis; colon tumor; confocal microscopy; controlled study; genetic transfection; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; nuclear localization signal; protein expression; protein localization; tumor invasion; cell differentiation; cell fractionation; cell nucleus; colon tumor; intestine mucosa; metabolism; pathology; protein transport; staining; Cell Differentiation; Cell Nucleus; Colonic Neoplasms; Homeodomain Proteins; Humans; Intestinal Mucosa; Protein Transport; Staining and Labeling; Subcellular Fractions",2-s2.0-85025603023

However, their profiles are influenced by subject background, which may lead to confounding results. This study aimed to evaluate whether age and gender affect lipid metabolite levels in the plasma of healthy Japanese adults. Comprehensive lipidomic analysis was performed using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for overnight fasted volunteers consisting of 4 groups of 15 subjects each: young males (25-35 years), elderly males (55-64 years), young females (25-35 years), and elderly females (55-65 years). Of 326 detected lipids, none showed significant gender-associated differences in the young groups and 3 metabolites showed significant gender-associated differences in the elderly groups, suggesting that age has little impact on plasma lipid levels in Japanese subjects. We found age-associated differences in 111 (34%) and 115 (35%) metabolites in males and females, respectively, indicating that the subjects’ age should be considered an important confounding factor for lipid biomarker exploration and validation studies in Japanese populations. These findings provide fundamental information on biomarker discovery, validation, and qualification processes in Japanese populations, and facilitate the evaluation of biomarker candidates found in other populations. ? 2017 American Pharmacists Association?",elderly; gender; HPLC; lipids; mass spectrometry; metabolism,glycerophospholipid; lipid; neutral lipid; polyunsaturated fatty acid; sphingolipid; unclassified drug; biological marker; lipid; adult; age; aged; Article; female; human; Japanese (people); lipid blood level; lipidomics; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; middle aged; normal human; sex difference; aging; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; lipid metabolism; mass spectrometry; metabolism; sexual characteristics; Adult; Aged; Aging; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biomarkers; Female; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Lipids; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Middle Aged; Sex Characteristics,2-s2.0-85023600484

evaluate the association of functional mitral regurgitation (FMR), preserved or reduced ejection fraction (EF), and ischemic or nonischemic origin with outcomes in patients discharged alive after hospitalization for acute decompensated heart failure (HF). Of the 4,842 patients enrolled in the Acute Decompensated Heart Failure Syndromes (ATTEND) registry, 3,357 patients were evaluated to assess the association of FMR, preserved or reduced EF, and ischemic or nonischemic origin with the primary end point (all-cause death and readmission for HF after discharge). At the time of discharge, FMR was assessed semiquantitatively (classified as none, mild, or moderate to severe) by color Doppler analysis of the regurgitant jet area. According to multivariable analysis, in the ischemic group, either mild or moderate to severe FMR in patients with a preserved EF had a significantly higher risk of the primary end point than patients without FMR (hazard ratio [HR] 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12 to 2.29; p = 0.010 and HR 1.98; 95% CI 1.30 to 3.01; p = 0.001, respectively). In patients with reduced EF with an ischemic origin, only moderate to severe FMR was associated with a significantly higher risk of the primary end point (HR 1.67; 95% CI 1.11 to 2.50; p = 0.014). In the nonischemic group, there was no significant association between FMR and the primary end point in patients with either a preserved or reduced EF. In conclusion, among patients with acute decompensated HF with a preserved or reduced EF, the association of FMR with adverse outcomes may differ between patients who had an ischemic or nonischemic origin of HF. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; eplerenone; inotropic agent; loop diuretic agent; spironolactone; vasodilator agent; warfarin; acute heart failure; adverse outcome; aged; Article; cardiac patient; cause of death; clinical evaluation; color Doppler echocardiography; controlled study; disease association; disease registry; disease severity; diuretic therapy; female; follow up; heart failure with preserved ejection fraction; heart failure with reduced ejection fraction; high risk patient; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; hospitalization; human; ischemic mitral valve regurgitation; major clinical study; male; mitral valve regurgitation; nonischemic functional mitral regurgitation; priority journal; prognosis; quantitative study; acute disease; clinical trial; complication; diagnostic imaging; Doppler echocardiography; heart failure; heart left ventricle function; heart stroke volume; heart ventricle; incidence; Japan; Mitral Valve Insufficiency; mortality; multicenter study; Myocardial Ischemia; pathophysiology; physiology; prospective study; register; severity of illness index; survival rate; trends; Acute Disease; Cause of Death; Echocardiography, Doppler; Female; Heart Failure; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Incidence; Japan; Male; Mitral Valve Insufficiency; Myocardial Ischemia; Prospective Studies; Registries; Severity of Illness Index; Stroke Volume; Survival Rate; Ventricular Function, Left",2-s2.0-85021982837

We experimentally addressed this issue. Methods: Anti-HBs-positive sera were obtained by vaccination with genotype A- or C-derived HBs antigen (HBsAg, gtA-sera or gtC-sera). Their reactivity to genotype A- and C-derived HBsAg (gtA-Ag and gtC-Ag) was measured by ELISA. The capacity of sera to neutralize HBV was evaluated using an in vitro infection model. Results: Of 135 anti-gtA-Ag-reactive gtA-sera, 134 (99.3%) were anti-gtC-Ag-reactive. All (100%) 120 anti-gtC-Ag-reactive gtC-sera were anti-gtA-Ag-reactive. The reactivity to gtA-Ag was strongly correlated with that to gtC-Ag (gtA-sera, ρ?=?0.989; gtC-sera, ρ?=?0.953; p?<?0.01). In gtA-sera (n?=?10), anti-HBs to gtA-Ag were less completely absorbed with gtC-Ag (96.4%) than with gtA-Ag (100%, p?<?0.05). Similarly, in gtC-sera (n?=?10), anti-HBs to gtC-Ag were less completely absorbed with gtA-Ag (96.0%) than with gtC-Ag (100%, p?<?0.01). Thus, 3.6 and 4.0% of anti-HBs in gtA-sera and gtC-sera were vaccine genotype HBsAg-specific, respectively. In the neutralization test, gtA-sera (n?=?4) and gtC-sera (n?=?3) with anti-HBs titers adjusted to 100?mIU/mL equally inhibited genotype C HBV infection (92.8 vs. 95.4%, p?=?0.44). However, at 30?mIU/mL, the gtA-sera less effectively inhibited infection than the gtC-sera (60.2 vs. 90.2%, p?<?0.05). Conclusions: Vaccination with genotype A- or C-derived HBsAg provided polyclonal anti-HBs that sufficiently bound to non-vaccine genotype HBsAg. However, a small portion of anti-HBs were specific to the vaccine genotype HBsAg. High anti-HBs titers would be required to prevent HBV infection of non-vaccine genotypes.

Here, we examined selection of controls in our study using an analytic epidemiology approach. The study period was from October 1, 2009 through September 30, 2014. Cases comprised ?65-year-old patients newly diagnosed with pneumonia. For every case with pneumonia, two patients with other diseases (one respiratory medicine, one non-respiratory medicine) who were sex-, age-, visit date- and visit hospital-matched were selected as controls. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of vaccination for pneumonia were calculated using conditional logistic regression model. Similar analyses were also conducted based on the clinical department of controls. Analysis was conducted in 234 cases and 438 controls. Effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination or influenza vaccination against pneumonia was not detected. Proportions of either vaccination in controls were greater among respiratory medicine (pneumococcal vaccine, 38%; influenza vaccine, 55%) than among non-respiratory medicine (23%; 48%). Analysis using controls restricted to respiratory medicine showed marginally significant effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination (OR, 0.59; 95%CI, 0.34–1.03; P = 0.064) and influenza vaccination (0.64; 0.40–1.04; 0.072). However, this effectiveness might have been overestimated by selection bias of controls, as pneumonia cases are not necessarily respiratory medicine patients. In the analysis using controls restricted to non-respiratory medicine, OR of pneumococcal vaccination for pneumonia was close to 1, presumably because the proportion of pneumococcal vaccination was higher in cases than in controls. Because pneumococcal vaccine was not routinely administered during the study period, differences in recommendations of vaccination by physician in different clinical departments might have greatly affected vaccination proportions. When we select controls, we should consider the background factors (underlying diseases, clinical department, etc.) which affect physicians’ recommendation of vaccination. ? 2017 The Authors",23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine; Case-control study; Effectiveness; Elderly people; Pneumonia; Seasonal influenza vaccine,"influenza vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; seasonal influenza vaccine; unclassified drug; 23-valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide vaccine; influenza vaccine; Pneumococcus vaccine; vaccine; aged; analytic epidemiology; Article; bacterium detection; community acquired pneumonia; comorbidity; controlled study; drug efficacy; elderly care; epidemiology; female; hospital based case control study; human; Japan; major clinical study; male; medical history; patient selection; priority journal; selection bias; sputum culture; Streptococcus pneumoniae; vaccination; case control study; control group; hospitalization; immunology; odds ratio; research subject; season; statistics and numerical data; Streptococcus pneumonia; very elderly; virus pneumonia; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Control Groups; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; Influenza Vaccines; Male; Odds Ratio; Pneumococcal Vaccines; Pneumonia, Pneumococcal; Pneumonia, Viral; Research Subjects; Seasons; Vaccination; Vaccine Potency",2-s2.0-85027303285

Reactive oxygen species produce oxidative stress and contribute to colorectal carcinogenesis. Because dietary citrus has been shown to reduce oxidative stress, we investigated the effects of citrus peel extract at dilutions of 1/200–1/500 on the activity of oxidative-stress-related transcription factors, including AP-1, NF-κB, NRF2, p53, and STAT3, in human colon cancer cell line HCT116 cells using a luciferase reporter gene assay. NRF2 transcriptional activities were 1.8- to 2.0-fold higher than the untreated control value. In addition, NF-κB, p53, and STAT3 transcriptional activities were 12–26% lower than the untreated control value. Administration of dried citrus peel in the diet of F344 rats at a dose of 1,000?ppm prevented the formation of azoxymethane-induced precancerous aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon. The total number of ACF in rats fed with dried citrus peel was reduced to 75% of the control value. Moreover, the levels of oxidative-stress-related markers, reactive carbonyl species, in the serum of F344 rats were significantly reduced following the administration of dried citrus peel. These data suggest that citrus peel possesses an ability to suppress cellular oxidative stress through induction of NRF2, thereby preventing azoxymethane-induced colon carcinogenesis. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"antineoplastic agent; azoxymethane; citrus peel extract; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; plant extract; protein p53; STAT3 protein; transcription factor AP 1; transcription factor Nrf2; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; azoxymethane; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; NFE2L2 protein, human; Nfe2l2 protein, rat; plant extract; STAT3 protein; Stat3 protein, rat; transcription factor AP 1; transcription factor Nrf2; aberrant crypt focus; animal experiment; antineoplastic activity; Article; colon carcinogenesis; controlled study; female; Fischer 344 rat; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; luciferase assay; male; mandarin; nonhuman; oxidative stress; precancer; rat; reporter gene; animal; carcinogenesis; chemically induced; chemistry; Citrus; colon; colon tumor; disease model; drug effect; genetics; metabolism; oxidative stress; pathology; Animals; Anticarcinogenic Agents; Azoxymethane; Carcinogenesis; Citrus; Colon; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; HCT116 Cells; Humans; NF-E2-Related Factor 2; NF-kappa B; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; STAT3 Transcription Factor; Transcription Factor AP-1",2-s2.0-85024483130

HIV transcription is regulated by both viral and cellular transcription factors. Numerous epigenetic factors, as well as transcriptional suppressor proteins, play major roles in the maintenance of transcriptional silencing of viral gene expression from the proviral DNA. Once inducible transcription factors such as nuclear factor κB are activated through extracellular signaling, viral latency is terminated and transcription from the silenced proviral DNA is initiated. Transcriptional induction by cellular factors is immediately followed by high gene expression via the function of the virus-encoded transcriptional activator Tat. Interestingly, unlike other known transcriptional activators, Tat primarily activates transcriptional elongation, rather than initiation, by interacting with and activating cellular positive transcriptional elongation factor b (P-TEFb). In this review, we describe how HIV transcription is negatively and positively regulated through its life cycle and the molecular mechanism underlying how Tat activates viral transcription. We propose a novel strategy against viral replication in which regulated transcriptional processes play important roles in determining the extent of viral replication. The structural details of how Tat interacts with P-TEFb are described, which may be useful for the development of effective and specific anti-HIV therapies. ? 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.",CDK9; Cyclin T1; HIV transcription; Molecular dynamics simulation; P-TEFB; PPI detection; Protein-protein interaction; Tat,"aciclovir; cyclin T1; DNA; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; positive transcription elongation factor b; small nuclear ribonucleoprotein; transactivator protein; positive transcription elongation factor b; transactivator protein; cell activation; epigenetics; fluorescence analysis; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; gene activation; gene control; gene expression; gene function; heredity; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; life cycle; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; priority journal; protein function; protein protein interaction; protein structure; regulatory mechanism; Review; signal transduction; transcription elongation; transcription initiation; virus gene; virus latency; virus replication; virus transcription; genetic epigenesis; genetics; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; metabolism; transcription initiation; virology; Epigenesis, Genetic; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Positive Transcriptional Elongation Factor B; Signal Transduction; tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus; Transcriptional Activation; Virus Latency; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-85038629054

The detection of a 2nd mutation is important for planning the next therapy when patients acquire resistance to the first line EGFR-TKI. Methods: We used a competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (CAST-PCR) to analyze the incidence and clinical significance of T790M mutations in 153 lung adenocarcinomas with EGFR-activating mutations. To increase the sensitivity and specificity of the detection of T790M mutations, we subjected 20 of the 153 cases to a digital PCR. The genomic DNAs were extracted from frozen, surgically resected tumor tissue specimens. Results: The CAST-PCR detected T790M mutations in 45 (29.4%) of the 153 cases. The analytical sensitivity in the detection T790M mutations was 0.13-2.65% (average 0.27%, median 0.20%). In contrast, the digital PCR, detected T790M mutations in 8 (40%) out of 20 cases. Conclusions: Our study shows that the pretreatment incidence of T790M mutation was less than that reported in previous studies. In order to clinically use pretreatment EGFR T790M mutation identification method, we should clarify the adequate methods and tissue preserved status. ?

Hepatitis has been a recent focus with the development of a National Strategic Plan on Hepatitis and plans to subsidize HCV treatment. Methods: During a two-day national liver disease symposium covering HCV, HBV, hepatocellular (HCC), and end-stage liver disease (ESLD), physician surveys were administered using the automated response system (ARS) to assess physician knowledge, perceptions of barriers to screening and treatment, and proposed solutions. Multivariate logistic regression was used to estimate odds ratio (OR) relating demography and practice factors with higher provider knowledge and improvement. Results: One hundred two physicians attending from various specialty areas (31.0% specializing in gastroenterology/hepatology and/or infectious disease) were of mixed gender (46.8% male), were younger than or equal to 40 years old (51.1% 20 to 40 years), had less experience (61.6% with 10 years of medical practice), were from the metropolitan area of Yangon (72.1%), and saw <10 liver disease patients per week (74.3%). The majority of physicians were not comfortable with treating or managing patients with liver disease. The post-test scores demonstrated an improvement in liver disease knowledge (9.0% ± 27.0) compared to the baseline pre-test scores; no variables were associated with significant improvement in hepatitis knowledge. Physicians identified the cost of diagnostic blood tests and treatment as the most significant barrier to treatment. Top solutions proposed were universal screening policies (46%), removal of financial barriers for treatment (29%), patient education (14%) and provider education (11%). Conclusions: Physician knowledge improved after this symposium, and many other needs were revealed by the physician input on barriers to care and their solutions. These survey results are important in guiding the next steps to improve liver disease management and future medical education efforts in Myanmar. ? 2017 Kim et al.

The present study tested the hypothesis that carotid IMT predicts new onset of hypertension in the normotensive subjects. A total of 867 participants were enrolled from our yearly physical checkup program and their carotid IMT was measured. After a baseline examination, the subjects were followed up for a median of 1091 days with the endpoint being the development of hypertension. At baseline, the carotid IMT value was 0.75 ± 0.16 mm. Hypertension developed in 184 subjects during the follow-up (76.9/1000 person-years). The incidence of hypertension was increased across the tertiles of the carotid IMT value (39.6, 70.0, and 134.5/1000 person-years in the first, second, and third tertiles, respectively, P <.001 by log-rank test). Multivariate Cox-hazard analysis after adjustment identified carotid IMT, taken as a continuous variable, as a significant predictor of new-onset hypertension (hazard ratio = 7.08, 95% confidence interval = 3.06-15.39). Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analyses indicated a significant correlation between the carotid IMT at baseline and yearly increases in systolic blood pressure during the follow-up period (β = 0.189, P <.001). Carotid IMT is an independent predictor of hypertension onset in normotensive subjects. The findings also suggested a close association between increased carotid IMT and blood pressure. ? 2017 the Author(s).

This paper presents the clinical features of individuals with organised haematoma, and describes cases in which a novel modified approach was successfully applied for resection of organised haematoma in the maxillary sinus. Method: Pre-operative examination data were evaluated retrospectively. Modified transnasal endoscopic medial maxillectomy was employed. Results: Fourteen patients with organised haematoma were treated. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed heterogeneous enhancement in all patients. Eight patients underwent modified transnasal endoscopic medial maxillectomy, without complications such as facial numbness, tooth numbness, facial tingling, lacrimation and eye discharge. Dissection of the apertura piriformis and anterior maxillary wall was not necessary for any of these eight patients. No recurrence was observed. Conclusion: Pre-operative examinations can be helpful in determining the likelihood of organised haematoma.

Materials and methods: Twenty-six patients with carcinosarcomas and 26 with uterine corpus carcinomas constituted a derivation cohort. The following nine MRI features of the tumors were evaluated: inhomogeneity, predominant signal intensity, presence of hyper- and hypointense areas, conspicuity of tumor margin, cervical canal extension on T2WI, presence of hyperintense areas on T1WI, contrast defect area volume percentage, and degree of enhancement. Two predictive models—with and without contrast—were constructed using multivariate logistic regression analysis. Fifteen other patients with carcinosarcomas and 30 patients with carcinomas constituted a validation cohort. The sensitivity and specificity of each model for the validation cohort were calculated. Results: Inhomogeneity, predominant signal intensity on T2WI, and presence of hyperintense areas on T1WI were significant predictors in the unenhanced-MRI-based model.

CTAs are highly immunogenic proteins, and thus represent ideal targets for cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-mediated specific immune therapy. The aim of this study was to screen CTA expression in various types of salivary gland carcinoma and to clarify clinicopathological significance of MAGE-A and NY-ESO-1 expression in adenoid cystic carcinomas (AdCCs) of the salivary gland, which is one of the most common salivary gland carcinomas, and usually has a fatal outcome. Methods and results: We used immunohistochemistry to examine the expression of four CTAs (MAGE-A, NY-ESO-1, CT7, and GAGE7) in various types of salivary gland carcinoma (n = 95). When carcinoma cases were divided into low-grade and intermediate/high-grade types, NY-ESO-1 and CT7 were expressed more frequently in intermediate/high-grade carcinomas. We then focused on MAGE-A and NY-ESO-1 expression in a large cohort of adenoid cystic carcinomas (AdCCs) (n = 46). MAGE-A and NY-ESO-1 were frequently expressed in AdCC; specifically, MAGE-A was expressed in >60% of the AdCC cases. MAGE-A expression and tumour site (minor salivary gland) were identified as independent risk factors for locoregional tumour recurrence. Conclusions: These findings suggest that CTAs may be expressed in a variety of salivary gland carcinomas, especially in those with higher histological grades. In addition, MAGE-A, which is frequently expressed in AdCC cases, may be a useful prognostic factor for poorer locoregional recurrence-free survival. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",adenoid cystic carcinoma; cancer/testis antigens; immunohistochemistry; salivary gland carcinomas,"cancer testis antigen; melanoma antigen; NY ESO 1 antigen; CTAG1B protein, human; membrane protein; tumor antigen; tumor marker; acinar cell carcinoma; adenoid cystic carcinoma; adult; aged; antigen expression; Article; basal cell carcinoma; cancer control; cancer grading; cancer localization; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer size; cancer staging; carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma; clinical article; disease free survival; distant metastasis; epithelial myoepithelial carcinoma; female; follow up; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; local recurrence free survival; lymph node metastasis; male; mammary analogue secretory carcinoma; mouth cavity; mucoepidermoid tumor; myoepithelial carcinoma; neck dissection; outcome assessment; overall survival; parotid gland; perineural invasion; primary tumor; priority journal; salivary duct carcinoma; salivary gland carcinoma; sublingual gland; submandibular gland; surgical margin; tongue; adenoid cystic carcinoma; biosynthesis; Kaplan Meier method; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; pathology; proportional hazards model; salivary gland tumor; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antigens, Neoplasm; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Adenoid Cystic; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Membrane Proteins; Middle Aged; Proportional Hazards Models; Salivary Gland Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85020128246

Methods: Study subjects had histologically confirmed primary non-small-cell lung cancer staged as T1a-T2aN0M0 and pulmonary oligometastasis. The primary endpoint was the incidence of Grade ?3 radiation pneumonitis (RP) within 180?days of the start of SBRT. The secondary endpoint was local control and overall survival rates. Five patients were initially enrolled at level 1 [50?Gy/4 fractions (Fr)]; during the observation period, level 0 (45?Gy/4 Fr) was opened. The dose was escalated to the next level when grade ?3 RP was observed in 0 out of 5 or 1 out of 10 patients. Virtual quality assurance planning was performed for 60?Gy/4 Fr; however, dose constraints for the organs at risk did not appear to be within acceptable ranges. Therefore, level 2 (55?Gy/4 Fr) was regarded as the upper limit. After the recommended dose (RD) was established, 15 additional patients were enrolled at the RD. The prescribed dose was normalized at the 95% volume border of the planning target volume based on the Monte Carlo algorithm. Results: Between September 2011 and September 2015, 40 patients (primary 30; metastasis 10) were enrolled. Five patients were enrolled at level 0, 15 at level 1, and 20 at level 2. Only one grade 3 RP was observed at level 1. Two-year local control and overall survival rates were 98 and 81%, respectively. Conclusion: The RD was 55?Gy/4 Fr. SBRT with real-time tumor tracking using CyberKnife based on the Monte Carlo algorithm was tolerated well and appeared to be effective for solitary lung tumors. ? 2017, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",CyberKnife; Lung tumors; Monte Carlo algorithm; Phase I/II study; Stereotactic body radiotherapy; Tracking,"adult; aged; Article; cancer control; cancer survival; clinical article; clinical study; CyberKnife; dosimetry; female; human; incidence; lung metastasis; male; Monte Carlo method; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; priority journal; radiation pneumonia; stereotactic body radiation therapy; survival rate; tumor volume; very elderly; algorithm; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; clinical trial; devices; Lung Neoplasms; middle aged; mortality; pathology; procedures; radiosurgery; radiotherapy dosage; radiotherapy planning system; treatment outcome; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Algorithms; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Monte Carlo Method; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85018476732

We evaluated the efficacy of partial or subtotal thymectomy for early-stage thymoma in the prospective study. Methods: The Japanese Association for Research on the Thymus conducted a multiple institutional study of thymectomy for thymoma localized in the thymus without total thymectomy. Patients without autoimmune disease who had an anterior mediastinal tumor that had been clinically diagnosed as an early-stage thymoma were enrolled in the study. Patients who were positive for anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies were excluded. Results: Sixty-three patients were enrolled preoperatively; 27 patients were judged as being inappropriate based on the other thymic pathologies or tumor invasion. The remaining 36 cases were diagnosed as early-staged thymoma and analyzed. The mean age of the patients was 61?years. The mean maximal tumor diameter in the resected specimens was 3.6?cm. The most common pathological types of thymoma were AB (n?=?10) and B1 (n?=?10). The Masaoka stages were classified as stage I (n?=?22) and II (n?=?14). The mean observation period was 63?months. Two patients died due to respiratory dysfunction, which was not related to thymoma. One hundred percent of the patients remained recurrence-free. Conclusions: This prospective study suggested the efficacy of partial or subtotal thymectomy for early-stage thymoma in patients without any apparent evidence of autoimmune disease.

Nowadays, a rapid construction of three-dimensional electroanatomical maps, which has an analysis function for complex arrhythmias, named ‘Window Sliding’ (WS) is available. However, little data has revealed the efficacy of this mapping strategy. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of the WS analysis for AT treatments. All patients underwent electrophysiological studies during ATs and the characteristics of the ATs were analyzed using rapid high-density mapping followed by the WS analysis. RFA was then performed. Fifty-five ATs were identified in 34 patients (63 ± 17 year-old) and in 51 activation maps (cycle length, 322 ± 120 milliseconds) were successfully constructed with 644 ± 433 points per map during 5.3 ± 2.5?min. The types of detected ATs were macro-reentries around the mitral (8) and, tricuspid (12) valves, roof-dependent reentry (5), others (13), and focal patterns (13). Of those that underwent RFA, 46 (98%) were treated successfully. Two ATs were abandoned since their critical sites were close to the His bundle and sinoatrial node. During a mean follow-up period of 179 ± 176 days, 7 patients had documented recurrences of AT. This high-density mapping using the WS analysis was useful for creating the entire picture of the ATs in a short time, resulting in favorable RFA outcomes. ? 2017, Springer Japan.",Activation map; Atrial tachycardia; Rapid and high-density electroanatomical mapping; Slow conduction zone; Window Sliding,"adult; analytic method; Article; cardiac mapping system; cardiovascular catheter; cardiovascular system examination; catheter; catheter ablation; circular mapping catheter; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; deflectable circular catheter; feasibility study; female; focal atrial tachycardia; follow up; general aspects of disease; heart rate and rhythm; heart rate variability; His bundle; human; image analysis; image reconstruction; macro reentrant atrial tachycardia; male; middle aged; mitral valve; outcome assessment; priority journal; radiofrequency ablation; rapid high density electroanatomical mapping; recurrent disease; retrospective study; roof dependent reentry; sinus node; slow conduction zone; supraventricular tachycardia; tachycardia cycle length; tricuspid valve; window sliding analysis; atrial fibrillation; body surface potential mapping; catheter ablation; heart atrium; heart muscle conduction system; pathophysiology; predictive value; procedures; three dimensional imaging; time factor; treatment outcome; Atrial Fibrillation; Body Surface Potential Mapping; Catheter Ablation; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Atria; Heart Conduction System; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Middle Aged; Predictive Value of Tests; Retrospective Studies; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85014612331

We also evaluated the data of patients who underwent a fourth debulking surgery (i.e., quaternary debulking surgery (QDS)). Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 164 patients with recurrent M?llerian epithelial cancers (i.e., ovarian, tubal, and peritoneal cancers). The SDS was performed between January 2000 and September 2014 in 20 Japanese hospitals. Clinicopathological data were collected and analyzed. Results: Of the 164 patients, 66 patients did not have a recurrence or died after SDS. Ninety-eight patients had a recurrence after SDS. Forty-three of the 98 patients underwent TDS; 55 of the 98 patients did not undergo TDS and were classified into the non-TDS group. The overall survival (OS) after SDS was significantly better in the TDS group than in the non-TDS group. The median OS after SDS was 123 and 42 months in the TDS group and non-TDS group, respectively. Of the 43 patients who received TDS, 11 patients were further treated with QDS. The median OS after SDS was 123 months for patients who underwent QDS. Conclusions: This multicenter study on the prognosis of post-SDS is apparently the first report on QDS in Japan. Patients undergoing TDS have a good prognosis, compared to patients in the non-TDS group.

Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is known to improve these broad dimensions of psychopathology in addition to PD symptoms. However, little is known about the predictors of treatment response in comorbid psychiatric symptoms after CBT for PD. Recent studies suggest that anxiety sensitivity (AS) may be a key vulnerability for PD. This study aimed to examine AS as a predictor of broad dimensions of psychopathology after CBT for PD. Materials and methods: In total, 118 patients with PD were treated with manualized group CBT. We used multiple regression analysis to examine the associations between 3 Anxiety Sensitivity Index (ASI) factors (physical concerns, mental incapacitation concerns, and social concerns) at baseline and the subscales of the Symptom Checklist-90 Revised (SCL-90-R) at endpoint. Results: Low levels of social concerns at baseline predicted low levels on 5 SCL-90-R subscales after CBT: interpersonal sensitivity, depression, hostility, paranoid ideation, and psychosis. High levels of mental incapacitation concerns significantly predicted low levels on 3 SCL-90-R subscales after treatment: interpersonal sensitivity, hostility, and paranoid ideation. Physical concerns at baseline did not predict broad dimensions of psychopathology. Conclusion: This study suggested that the social concerns and mental incapacitation concerns subscales of the ASI at baseline predicted several dimensions of psychopathology after CBT for PD. To improve comorbid psychopathology, it may be useful to direct more attention to these ASI subscales. ? 2017 Ino et al.",Anxiety sensitivity; Cognitive behavioral therapy; Comorbid psychopathology; Panic disorder; Predictor,adult; anxiety; Anxiety Sensitivity Index; Article; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; depression; female; hostility; human; human relation; major clinical study; male; panic; paranoia; prediction; psychosis; Symptom Checklist 90; therapy effect,2-s2.0-85025804703

While MR cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) can only visualize the bile ducts, 3D balanced turbo-field-echo (BTFE) sequence clearly depicts the bile ducts and portal veins as well as drip infusion CT cholangiography (DIC-CT), without contrast media. We evaluated whether BTFE could substitute for DIC-CT. Materials and methods: Thirty patients undergoing MRCP and BTFE on 1.5-T MR and DIC-CT were evaluated. Two readers retrospectively evaluated the branching pattern (supra-type: A–C or infra-type: D–E) and scored the degree of confidence and motion artifacts using a 3-point scale for the three 2-mm-thick reconstructed images. Results: The bile duct diameter did not differ between DIC-CT and MRCP (p?=?0.07). Five patients (17%) had intrahepatic biliary dilatation (>3?mm). The A, B, C, D, and E types were diagnosed in 21, 6, 1, 1, and 1 patient, respectively (28 supra-types and 2 infra-types) on DIC-CT. For DIC-CT, MRCP, and BTFE, the mean motion artifact scores were 3.0/3.0, 2.7/2.6, and 2.9/2.8, respectively. The mean diagnostic confidence scores were 2.9/2.9, 2.4/2.4, and 2.9/2.8, respectively, with no difference between DIC-CT and BTFE. The concordance between DIC-CT and BTFE was high (infra- or supra-type: κ?=?1.00/1.00, A–E: κ?=?0.86/0.66), but it was poor between DIC-CT and MRCP (infra- or supra-type: κ?=?0.35/?0.05, A–E: κ?=?0.33/0.41) for both readers. Conclusions: Similar to DIC-CT, the BTFE MR sequence had high diagnostic accuracy regarding the branching pattern of the intrahepatic bile duct, especially for the supra/infraportal type. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Branching pattern of the intrahepatic bile duct; Drip infusion CT cholangiography (DIC-CT); Supraportal/infraportal pattern; Three-dimensional balanced turbo-field-echo (3D-BTFE) MR sequence,"meglumine iotroxate; 3 point scale; adult; aged; Article; artifact; bile duct; bile duct cancer; bile duct carcinoma; bile duct dilatation; cholecystitis; cholelithiasis; clinical article; clinical evaluation; common bile duct cancer; common bile duct stone; computed tomography scanner; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; drip infusion computed tomography cholangiography; female; gallbladder cancer; human; image analysis; image quality; image reconstruction; infusion cholangiography; intrahepatic bile duct; liver cell carcinoma; liver metastasis; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; male; Mirizzi syndrome; motion; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; priority journal; rating scale; retrospective study; sclerosing cholangitis; scoring system; spiral computer assisted tomography; three dimensional balanced turbo field echo sequence; three dimensional imaging; cholangiography; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; digestive system tumor; intrahepatic bile duct; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Artifacts; Bile Ducts, Intrahepatic; Cholangiography; Digestive System Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85014146586

IFNL4 encodes IFNλ4, a newly discovered type III IFN, and its expression is controlled by rs368234815-TT/ΔG, which is in strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) with other tag SNPs within or near IFNL4 such as rs12979860 and rs8099917. Intrahepatic expression levels of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) affect the responsiveness to IFNα and are also associated with IFNL4 genotype. However, IFNL4 expressions and its role in intrinsic antiviral innate immunity remain unclear. This study evaluated the effect of IFNL4 on intrahepatic ISG expression and investigated its relationship with treatment outcomes in liver samples obtained from 49 chronic hepatitis C patients treated with pegylated (PEG)-IFN/ribavirin therapy. IFNL4 mRNA was detected in 11 of 22 patients with IFNL4-unfavorable SNPs but not in patients with favorable genotypes. IFNL4 expression was associated with non-response to PEG-IFN/ribavirin therapy. Intrahepatic expression of antiviral ISGs (ISG15 and MX1) was significantly higher in IFNL4-unfavorable patients with detectable IFNL4 mRNA than in patients with undetectable IFNL4 mRNA, whereas the expression of suppressive ISGs (RNF125, SOCS1, SOCS3, and RNF11) was lower in patients with detectable IFNL4 mRNA. In summary, intrahepatic expression of IFNL4 was associated with increased antiviral ISG expression and decreased suppressive ISG expression at baseline, resulting in poor responsiveness to IFNα-based therapy in HCV infection. ? 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",gene expression; genetic variation; hepatitis C virus; innate immunity; interferon,"gamma glutamyltransferase; peginterferon; ribavirin; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; suppressor of cytokine signaling 3; alpha interferon; cytokine; IFNL4 protein, human; interferon; interleukin derivative; ISG15 protein, human; messenger RNA; MX1 protein, human; Myxovirus resistance protein; ribavirin; SOCS1 protein, human; suppressor of cytokine signaling 1; ubiquitin; adult; aged; Article; chronic hepatitis C; clinical article; controlled study; female; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; gene; gene expression regulation; genetic association; genotype; Hepatitis C virus subtype 1b; human; IFNL4 gene; male; nonhuman; RNF11 gene; RNF125 gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; SOCS1 gene; SOCS3 gene; treatment response; virus load; antiviral resistance; chronic hepatitis C; drug effects; gene expression regulation; genetics; Hepacivirus; immunology; liver; metabolism; middle aged; virology; Adult; Aged; Cytokines; Drug Resistance, Viral; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Interferons; Interleukins; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Myxovirus Resistance Proteins; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Ribavirin; RNA, Messenger; Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling 1 Protein; Ubiquitins",2-s2.0-85013885124

However, the mechanisms of the difference have not been elucidated. This study aimed to examine whether there is a difference in the reduction in plasma brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) level and in left ventricular (LV) functional recovery between the CHF patients treated with the long-acting diuretic (the azosemide group) and the short-acting diuretic (the furosemide group). We reviewed changes in plasma BNP level and echo-assessed LV functional parameters from baseline to a year after the entry in 288 CHF patients with New York Heart Association class II or III symptoms that joined J-MELODIC. The decrease in plasma BNP levels was larger in the azosemide group than in the furosemide group (p < 0.01). The changes in echocardiographic parameters were not more favorable in the azosemide group than in the furosemide group. In conclusion, the decrease in plasma BNP levels was larger in the azosemide group than in the furosemide group. These findings may account for the better prognosis in CHF patients treated with azosemide than those with furosemide in J-MELODIC. ? 2017, Springer Japan.",Brain natriuretic peptide; Chronic heart failure; Echocardiography; Left ventricular ejection fraction; Loop diuretics,"azosemide; brain natriuretic peptide; furosemide; loop diuretic agent; azosemide; biological marker; brain natriuretic peptide; furosemide; loop diuretic agent; sulfanilamide derivative; aged; Article; body fluid; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; heart failure; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle enddiastolic volume; heart left ventricle function; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; outcome assessment; predictive value; priority journal; prognosis; protein blood level; protein function; randomized controlled trial; blood; chronic disease; clinical trial; echocardiography; heart failure; Japan; middle aged; prospective study; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers; Chronic Disease; Echocardiography; Female; Furosemide; Heart Failure; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Natriuretic Peptide, Brain; Prospective Studies; Sodium Potassium Chloride Symporter Inhibitors; Sulfanilamides",2-s2.0-85009858801

Further knowledge on the characteristics of HBV will facilitate its eradication. Genome structural variations (SVs) are defined by its canonical form such as duplication, deletion, and insertion. However, recent studies have reported complex SVs that cannot be explained by those canonical SVs. A HBV strain (UK2) with an unusual genome structure rearrangement that was completely different from known mutations or rearrangements was previously reported. Thus, this study was conducted to confirm the rearrangement in UK2 as a novel complex SV, and to find additional HBV strains with complex SVs. Further, the contribution of complex SVs in hepadnavirus variability was investigated. Methods The genome rearrangement pattern in UK2 was analyzed. Further, a search of online databases retrieved additional HBV strains which were candidates to harbor complex SVs. The architecture of each rearrangement in the candidate strains was analyzed by bioinformatical tools. In addition, alignment of woolly monkey hepatitis virus (WMHV) and HBV from human and non-human primates was performed to investigate the contribution of complex SVs to variability of hepadnavirus. Results The rearrangement in UK2 was confirmed as a complex SV. An additional 15 HBV strains were retrieved from databases, and confirmed as harboring complex SVs. Complex combinations of deletion, insertion, and duplication characterized the novel rearrangements. The complex SVs in six strains (37.5%) were composed of deletion, insertion, and duplication. The complex SVs in another six strains (37.5%) consisted of deletion and insertion, followed by insertions and duplication in three strains (18.8%), and deletion and duplication in one strain (6.3%). In addition, unique preS1 promoter insertions, which contained the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binding site, were observed in seven (43.8%) of 16 strains. Further, analysis of the genetic sequences of WMHV and HBV from human and non-human primates showed that complex combinations of deletions and insertions accounted for their genetic differences. Conclusions Non-canonical genetic rearrangements termed complex SVs were observed in HBV. Further, complex SVs accounted for the genetic differences of WMHV and HBV from human and non-human primates. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Complex structural variations; Hepadnavirus variability; Hepatitis B virus; Non-canonical genetic rearrangement,"hepatocyte nuclear factor 1; Article; binding site; gene deletion; gene duplication; gene insertion; genetic variation; Hepadnaviridae; Hepatitis B virus; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; priority journal; promoter region; virus genome; virus strain; woolly monkey; animal; biology; classification; gene rearrangement; genetics; Hepatitis B virus; human; isolation and purification; primate; Animals; Computational Biology; Gene Rearrangement; Genetic Variation; Genome, Viral; Hepatitis B virus; Humans; Primates",2-s2.0-85020924361

The number and size of glutathione S-transferase placental form (GST-P)-positive foci were significantly reduced by apocynin in a dose-dependent manner. The reduction of ROS generation by apocynin was confirmed by dihydroethidium staining. Apocynin treatment also significantly reduced Ki-67 positivity, downregulated cyclooxygenase 2, and suppressed the activation of the c-Myc pathway. Meanwhile, ROS generation was not different between GST-P-positive foci and surrounding GST-P-negative areas of the liver. In conclusion, the present data suggest that apocynin possesses a potential antihepatocarcinogenic property. ?

This article draws on qualitative data from a recently completed study conducted to explore whether it is feasible, acceptable and desirable to build on the recent European Everywhere project for adaptation and implementation in Japan. A series of expert workshops were conducted in Tokyo, Nagoya and Osaka with intersectoral representatives from Japanese and UK non-governmental organizations (NGOs), gay businesses, universities and gay communities (n = 46). Further discussion groups and meetings were held with NGO members and researchers from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare's Research Group on HIV Prevention Policy, Programme Implementation and Evaluation among MSM (n = 34). The results showed that it is desirable, feasible and acceptable to adapt and implement a Japanese version of Everywhere. Such a practical, policy-relevant, settingsbased HIV prevention framework for gay businesses may help to facilitate the necessary scale up of prevention responses among MSMin Japan. Given the high degree of sexual mobility between countries in Asia, there is considerable potential for the Everywhere Project (or its Japanese variant) to be expanded and adapted to other countries within the Asia-Pacific region. ?

Cationic liposome-protamine-DNA (LPD) has been traditionally used as the carrier of functional nucleic acids. The cytotoxicity derived from the cationic moiety has raised a concern to safely deliver nucleic acids, such as siRNA, to the target site. In the present study, LPD was coated with the natural anionic polymer, hyaluronic acid (HA), termed LPDH. The cytotoxicity and safety of LPDH was assessed in?vitro. LPD induced hemolysis of murine red blood cells and cytotoxicity in human endothelial cells, while LPDH remarkably reduced the hemolysis and cytotoxicity when compared to LPD at the same concentration of siRNA. Fluorescently-labeled LPD showed increased cellular uptake when compared to LPDH. In contrast, LPD and LPDH showed similar effects on gene silencing for the luciferase gene on the luciferase-expressing B16F0 cancer cell line. PEGylated LPD obstructed this gene silencing effect. These results indicate that LPDH can reduce the cytotoxicity associated with LPD with a comparable gene silencing response, suggesting that the coating of hyaluronic acid with cationic carriers is effective strategy to deliver siRNA with less cytotoxicity. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cationic liposome; Cytotoxicity; Hyaluronic acid; Melanoma; siRNA; siRNA delivery,fluorescent dye; hyaluronic acid; liposome protamine DNA complex; luciferase; nanocarrier; small interfering RNA; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal cell culture; animal experiment; Article; cytotoxicity; drug coating; drug delivery system; gene silencing; hemolysis; hemolysis assay; human; human cell; human cell culture; in vitro study; male; melanoma cell line; mouse; nonhuman; physical chemistry; safety; umbilical vein endothelial cell,2-s2.0-85019091757

To the best of our knowledge, only six cases have been reported in the literature. Here we report an additional case, which was complicated by an intra-tumoral hematoma on clinical presentation and by papillary thyroid carcinoma-like histology on intra-operative frozen section diagnosis. An asymptomatic 78-year-old male presented with a two-year-history of a painless tumor of the left parotid. An intra-tumoral hematoma, which is unusual for a salivary gland tumor, was suspected from results of pre-operative radiology. The patient then underwent a left parotidectomy. The intra-operative frozen section diagnosis indicated a benign tumor, although ectopic papillary thyroid carcinoma was raised as a differential diagnosis since the eosinophilic tumor cells occasionally possessed nuclear grooves and nuclear pseudo-inclusions. By precise histopathological examination using paraffin sections, the tumor was finally diagnosed as striated duct adenoma. This type of tumor has unique features of hypervascular stroma and papillary thyroid carcinoma-like nuclei. In our case, the former feature was associated with the intra-tumoral hematoma and the latter feature, with difficulty in frozen section tumor diagnosis. ? 2017 Japanese Society of Pathology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",canalicular adenoma; intra-operative frozen section diagnosis; intra-tumoral hematoma; papillary thyroid carcinoma-like histology; striated duct adenoma,"cytokeratin 5; cytokeratin 6; aged; Article; case report; cell membrane; cell proliferation; cytoplasm; disease duration; ear disease; ectopic thyroid gland; endothelium cell; hematoma; histology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; male; medical history; parotidectomy; priority journal; salivary gland cancer; salivary gland striated duct adenoma; small cell lung cancer; swelling; thyroid papillary carcinoma; tumor volume; very elderly; adenoma; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; frozen section; hematoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; papillary carcinoma; parotid gland; parotid gland tumor; pathology; thyroid tumor; Adenoma; Aged; Carcinoma, Papillary; Diagnosis, Differential; Frozen Sections; Hematoma; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Parotid Gland; Parotid Neoplasms; Thyroid Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85018911739

We performed a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to identify genetic variants associated with HCV-related lichen planus. Methods We conducted a GWAS of 261 patients with HCV infection treated at a tertiary medical center in Japan from October 2007 through January 2013; a total of 71 had lichen planus and 190 had normal oral mucosa. We validated our findings in a GWAS of 38 patients with HCV-associated lichen planus and 7 HCV-infected patients with normal oral mucosa treated at a medical center in Italy. Results Single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NRP2 (rs884000) and IGFBP4 (rs538399) were associated with risk of HCV-associated lichen planus (P &lt; 1 × 10?4). We also found an association between a single-nucleotide polymorphism in the HLA-DR/DQ genes (rs9461799) and susceptibility to HCV-associated lichen planus. The odds ratios for the minor alleles of rs884000, rs538399, and rs9461799 were 3.25 (95% confidence interval, 1.95–5.41), 0.40 (95% confidence interval, 0.25–0.63), and 2.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.41–3.28), respectively. Conclusions In a GWAS of Japanese patients with HCV infection, we replicated associations between previously reported polymorphisms in HLA class II genes and risk for lichen planus. We also identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms in NRP2 and IGFBP4 loci that increase and reduce risk of lichen planus, respectively. These genetic variants might be used to identify patients with HCV infection who are at risk for lichen planus. ? 2017 AGA Institute",Autoimmunity; Inflammation; Oral Mucosa; Risk Factor,"HLA DQ antigen; HLA DR antigen; neuropilin 2; somatomedin binding protein 4; neuropilin 2; neuropilin-2, human; somatomedin binding protein 4; adult; aged; allele; Article; controlled study; disease association; DQ gene; female; gene; gene replication; genetic identification; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; hepatitis C; HLA DR gene; human; Italy; Japan; Japanese (people); lichen planus; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mouth mucosa; single nucleotide polymorphism; tertiary health care; complication; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; hepatitis C; lichen planus; single nucleotide polymorphism; tertiary care center; Aged; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Hepatitis C; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor Binding Protein 4; Japan; Lichen Planus; Male; Middle Aged; Neuropilin-2; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Tertiary Care Centers",2-s2.0-85018872791

However, to complete these conservative therapies, patient cooperation is mandatory. If conservative therapy fails, surgery is required for reduction and prevention of recurrence. It has been considered that surgery for atlantoaxial rotatory fixation necessitates solid bony fusion. However, once bony fusion is achieved, loss of range of motion is problematic. Here, we report a patient with chro-AARF who was successfully treated with temporary internal fixation using a C1 lateral mass screw and C2 pedicle screw (Goel-Harms technique) without any grafting of bone or use of bone substitute materials. Case Description A 9-year-old boy with chro-AARF was referred to our institution. He had a history of pervasive developmental disorders. He did not cooperate for the completion of conservative therapy and could not tolerate this therapy. Therefore, the orthopedic staff and his parents considered surgery. Under general anesthesia, reduction was easily performed. The Goel-Harms screw-rod construct was completed as a temporary internal fixator without any grafting of bone or use of bone substitute materials. After 6 months, the screw-rod construct was removed. Removal of the screw-rod construct was performed easily without complication. There was no ankylosis of the C1-2 joint, and cervical range of motion was maintained 2.8 years after removal of the construct. Conclusions When conservative therapy cannot be continued, Goel-Harms surgery as a temporary internal fixator without bone grafting might be a suitable alternative for selected patients with chro-AARF. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.",Atlantal lateral mass screw; Atlantoaxial rotatory fixation; Bone grafting; Conservative therapy; Goel-Harms technique; Internal fixation; Surgical management,"Article; autism; bone prosthesis; bone radiography; bone transplantation; case report; child; chronic atlantoaxial rotatory fixation; clinical feature; computer assisted tomography; general anesthesia; human; male; medical history; osteosynthesis; pedicle screw; range of motion; school child; treatment refusal; atlantoaxial joint; chronic disease; devices; internal fixator; joint characteristics and functions; neck pain; pedicle screw; physiology; spine fusion; Torsion Abnormality; torticollis; x-ray computed tomography; Atlanto-Axial Joint; Child; Chronic Disease; Humans; Internal Fixators; Male; Neck Pain; Pedicle Screws; Range of Motion, Articular; Spinal Fusion; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Torsion Abnormality; Torticollis",2-s2.0-85018409550

However, publications on evacuation from NICUs are sparse. The 2016 Kumamoto Earthquakes caused serious damage to Kumamoto City Hospital and its level III regional core NICU. Local/neighbour NICU teams and the disaster-communication team of a neonatal academic society cooperated to evacuate 38 newborn infants from the ward. Objective: The aim of this paper was to highlight potential key factors to improve emergency NICU evacuation and coordination of hospital transportation following natural disasters. Methods: Background variables including clinical risk scores and timing/destination of transportation were compared between infants, who subsequently were transferred to destinations outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, and their peers. Results: All but 1 of the infants were successfully evacuated from their NICU within 8 h. One very-low-birth-weight infant developed moderate hypothermia following transportation. Fourteen infants were transferred to NICUs outside of Kumamoto Prefecture, which was associated with the diagnosis of congenital heart disease, dependence on respiratory support, higher risk scores, and longer elapsed time from the decision to departure. There was difficulty in arranging helicopter transportation because the coordination office of the Disaster Medical Assistance Team had requisitioned most air/ground ambulances and only helped arrange ground transportations for 13 low-risk infants. Transportation for all 10 high-risk infants (risk scores greater than or equal to the upper quartile) was arranged by local/neighbour NICUs. Conclusions: Although the overall evacuation process was satisfactory, potential risks of relying on the adult-based emergency transportation system were highlighted. A better system needs to be developed urgently to put appropriate priority on vulnerable infants. ? 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Methods: An OIR model in C57BL/6J mice was used as a retinal neovascularization model. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to evaluate the chronological change in vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and eotaxin expressions. CCR3 and VEGF subtype expression in the retina was examined using real-time RT-PCR, and CCR3, eotaxin, VEGF-A, and CD31 expression was examined immunohistochemically. A CCR3 neutralizing antibody (Ab) was injected into the vitreous humor on both postnatal days 12 (P12) and 14 (P14). Retinal neovascularizations were quantified by measurement of the percentages of neovascular area. Results: The mean eotaxin and VEGF-A protein level was significantly downregulated at P10 and P12 and was significantly upregulated at P14 and P17 (p < 0.05). CCR3 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated at P12 (p < 0.05). VEGF164 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated at P14 (p < 0.05). The areas of vaso-obliteration and neovascularization were significantly suppressed in anti-CCR3 Ab-treated eyes (p < 0.05). Anti-CCR3 Ab treatment suppressed VEGF and eotaxin but not monocyte chemoattractant protein-1. And VEGF 164 mRNA but not VEGF120 mRNA was suppressed by anti-CCR3 Ab treatment. Conclusions: The present data suggest that anti-CCR3 treatment can suppress retinal neovascularization. Anti-CCR3 treatment may have potential as a new therapy for retinopathies with retinal neovascularization such as diabetic retinopathy and retinopathy of prematurity. ? 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Materials and methods Single-shot diffusion echo-planar imaging without fat suppression was used and the imaging parameters were optimized to separate water and lipid DWIs by chemical shift displacement of the lipid signals along the phase-encoding direction. Using the optimized conditions, transverse DWIs at the maximum diameter of the right calf were scanned with multiple b-values in five healthy subjects. Then, apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) were calculated in the tibialis anterior muscle (TA), tibialis bone marrow (TB), and subcutaneous fat (SF), as well as restricted and perfusion-related diffusion coefficients (D and D*, respectively) and the fraction of the perfusion-related diffusion component (F) for TA. Results Water and lipid DWIs were separated adequately. The mean ADCs of the TA, TB, and SF were 1.56?±?0.03?mm2/s, 0.01?±?0.01?mm2/s, and 0.06?±?0.02?mm2/s, respectively. The mean D*, D, and F of the TA were 13.7?±?4.3?mm2/s, 1.48?±?0.05?mm2/s, and 4.3?±?1.6%, respectively. Conclusion SPLIT imaging makes it possible to simply and simultaneously obtain water and lipid DWIs without special pulse sequence and increases the amount of diffusion information of water and lipid tissue. ? 2017",Apparent diffusion coefficient; Chemical shift; Diffusion-weighted imaging; Echo-planar imaging; Lipid,"adult; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; bone marrow; controlled study; diffusion coefficient; diffusion weighted imaging; female; human; image analysis; imaging and display; lipid analysis; male; measurement accuracy; noise; perfusion related diffusion coefficient; shift displacement based separation of lipid tissue imaging; subcutaneous fat; tibialis anterior muscle; water analysis; young adult; chemistry; diffusion weighted imaging; echo planar imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pathology; perfusion; procedures; skeletal muscle; fatty acid; lipid; water; Adult; Bone Marrow; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Echo-Planar Imaging; Fatty Acids; Female; Humans; Lipids; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Muscle, Skeletal; Perfusion; Water; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85013972912

Because p53 function is depressed in most malignancies, if MSCs in malignancy also have p53 hypofunction, differentiation therapy to osteogenic or adipogenic lineage may be an effective treatment. We therefore wished to begin to explore this idea by evaluating atypical lipomatous tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDL) cells, because murine double minute 2 (MDM2) gene amplification, which leads to p53 hypofunction, is found in almost all ALT/WDLs. Questions/purposes: We compared osteogenic and adipogenic differentiation potency between MSCs isolated and cultured from normal adipose tissues and ALT/WDLs from the same patients. Methods: During tumor resections in six patients with ALT/WDL, we analyzed 3 mL of tumor, and for comparison, we harvested a similar amount of normal-appearing subcutaneous adipose tissue from an area remote from the tumor for comparison. Adipogenic differentiation potency was quantitatively assessed using spectrometry after oil red O staining. Osteogenic differentiation potency was semiquantitatively assessed by measuring a specific colored area after alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and alizarin red S staining. ALP is related to preosseous cellular metabolism, and alizarin red is related to calcium deposits in cell culture. There were three observers for each assessment, and each assessment (including induced-differentiation and histologic analysis) was performed in duplicate. We then analyzed the mechanism of the difference of osteogenic differentiation potency using the MDM2-specific inhibitor Nutlin-3 at various concentrations. Results: In terms of adipogenic differentiation potency, contrary to our expectations, more fatty acid droplets were observed in MSCs derived from normal fat than in MSCs derived from ALT/WDL, although we found no significant difference between MSCs derived from ALT/WDL and MSCs derived from normal fat; the mean differentiation potency values (normal adipose tissue versus ALT/WDL) (± SD) were 0.34 (SD, ± 0.13; 95% CI, 0.24–0.44) versus 0.25 (SD, ± 0.10; 95% CI, 0.18–0.33; p = 0.22). By contrast, we found greater osteogenic differentiation potency in MSCs derived from ALT/WDL than in MSCs derived from normal fat. The mean differentiation potency values (normal adipose tissue versus ALT/WDL) (±SD) based on ALP staining was 1.0 versus 17 (SD, ± 36; 95% CI, ?2.8 to 38; p = 0.04). However, we found no differences based on alizarin red S staining; mean differentiation potency value (normal adipose tissue versus ALT/WDL) (± SD) was 1.0 versus 4.2 (SD, ± 4.8; 95% CI, 1.3–7.2; p = 0.58). The gap of osteogenic differentiation potency between MSCs from normal adipose tissue and ALT/WDL was decreased as MDM2-inhibitor Nutlin-3 concentration increased. Conclusions: MSCs derived from ALT/WDL had higher osteogenic differentiation potency based on ALP staining, which disappeared as Nutlin-3 concentration increased, suggesting that could be caused by amplified MDM2 in ALT/WDL. Future laboratory studies might mechanistically confirm the gene and protein expression, and based on the mechanism of the gap of differentiation potency, if p53 contrast between MSCs in tumor and normal tissue could be stimulated, less-toxic and more-effective differentiation therapy to MSCs in malignancies might be developed. ? 2017, The Association of Bone and Joint Surgeons?.",,alizarin red s; alkaline phosphatase; calcium; fat droplet; fatty acid; nutlin 3; protein MDM2; protein p53; adipogenesis; adipose tissue; adult; Article; bone development; calcification; cancer patient; cancer surgery; cell differentiation; cell isolation; clinical article; controlled study; female; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; male; mesenchymal stem cell; middle aged; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reference value; staining; subcutaneous fat; tissue culture; tumor cell; tumor cell culture; tumor volume; well differentiated liposarcoma; adipose tissue; bone development; cell differentiation; comparative study; cytology; lipoma; liposarcoma; mesenchymal stroma cell; pathology; physiology; Adipose Tissue; Cell Differentiation; Female; Humans; Lipoma; Liposarcoma; Male; Mesenchymal Stromal Cells; Middle Aged; Osteogenesis,2-s2.0-85011591421

However, it is very difficult to repair anterior and lateral fractures with the previous transnasal endoscopic approaches, since repair of orbital fractures is managed through the middle meatus and ostium from the posterior side of the nasolacrimal duct with side-viewing endoscope and curved instruments. Therefore, the authors used modified transnasal endoscopic approach as an alternative for repair of orbital floor fractures in order to effectively reach the lateral or anterior fracture of the orbital floor with straight endoscope and instruments endoscopically. Methods: Modified transnasal endoscopic approach through anterior space to nasolacrimal duct was performed in patients with orbital floor fracture, when patients rejected extranasal approach and reconstruction could not be performed by the previous purely transnasal endoscopic approach. After removal of the medial maxillary bone, the lateral wall of nose was shifted in the medial direction to allow wider access to the maxillary sinus. The bone fragments entrapping the orbital content are removed carefully, and correction of periorbita is performed. After surgery, patients were asked whether they have symptoms and/or complications. Results: This modified approach was performed in 15 patients (10 males and 5 females). Mean age at surgery was 37.6 years with a range between 17 and 67. Double vision disappeared in all patients. Conclusions: This novel approach appears to be a safe and effective technique for the repair of orbital floor fractures. ? 2017 The Author(s).

Ectopic gastric and intestinal phenotypes, neuroendocrine cell differentiation, and SOX2 expression differ according to tumor grade in colorectal LSTs, and these markers are correlated with early tumor progression in each LST subtype. Introduction The significance of the ectopic gastric phenotype remains unclear in patients with colorectal laterally spreading tumors (LSTs). We investigated clinicopathologic differences among LST subtypes, aiming to identify factors indicative of malignant transformation and invasion that are linked to ectopic gastric phenotype and tumor progression. Materials and Methods We analyzed the morphologic characteristics of 105 colorectal LSTs resected by endoscopic submucosal dissection. LSTs were classified into 2 subtypes: granular (G-LST) and nongranular (NG-LST). Resected LSTs were analyzed histologically and were immunohistochemically stained for MUC5AC, MUC6, chromogranin A, CD10, and SOX2. Results The 105 LSTs included 60 G-LSTs and 45 NG-LSTs. By histology, G-LSTs comprised 5 adenomas with low-grade dysplasia (LAs), 45 adenomas with high-grade dysplasia (HAs), and 10 adenocarcinomas invading the submucosa (SMs). NG-LSTs comprised 8 LAs, 25 HAs, and 12 SMs. MUC5AC positivity was significantly higher in G-LSTs compared to NG-LSTs (P = .002), and MUC5AC positivity in HA lesions was significantly higher than in LA lesions (P = .01). MUC6 and SOX2 positivity in SM G-LSTs, and chromogranin A positivity in SM NG-LSTs were significantly higher than in HAs (P = .01, .01, and .03, respectively). CD10 positivity in SM NG-LSTs was significantly higher than in HAs and LAs (P = .02 and .01, respectively).

The present study aimed to explore the demographic, medical, and psychological factors associated with patient preferences with regard to communication of bad news. Methods: Outpatients with a variety of cancers were consecutively invited to participate in our study after their follow-up medical visit. A questionnaire assessed their preferences regarding the communication of bad news, covering four factors-(1) how bad news is delivered, (2) reassurance and emotional support, (3) additional information, and (4) setting- A s well as on demographic, medical, and psychosocial factors. Results: A total of 529 outpatients with a variety of cancers completed the questionnaire. Multiple regression analyses indicated that patients who were younger, female, had greater faith in their physician, and were more highly educated placed more importance on how bad news is delivered than patients who were older, male, had less faith in their physician, and a lower level of education. Female patients and patients without an occupation placed more importance on reassurance and emotional support. Younger, female, and more highly educated patients placed more importance on additional information. Younger, female, and more highly educated patients, along with patients who weren't undergoing active treatment placed more importance on setting. Significance of Results: Patient preferences with regard to communication of bad news are associated with factors related to patient background. Physicians should consider these characteristics when delivering bad news and use an appropriate communication style tailored to each patient. ? 2016 Cambridge University Press.",Bad news; Communication; Patient preferences; Patient-oncologist relationship,adult; attitude to health; doctor patient relation; female; human; interpersonal communication; male; middle aged; mortality; neoplasm; patient care; patient preference; patient satisfaction; procedures; psychology; questionnaire; social support; standards; Adult; Attitude to Health; Communication; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasms; Patient Preference; Patient Satisfaction; Patient-Centered Care; Physician-Patient Relations; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Truth Disclosure,2-s2.0-84994065434

The coagulation factor V R506Q (Leiden) mutation is a well known risk factor for recurrent miscarriage, although it has not been found in Japanese populations. We examined whether the factor V Nara and Hong Kong mutations, the factor V gene (F5) 16 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), including the factor V R2 haplotype, and plasma factor V activity (FV:C) were risk factors for recurrent miscarriage. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 88 patients with a history of unexplained recurrent miscarriage and 95 fertile controls. None of the patients or controls was homozygous or heterozygous for the factor V Nara or Hong Kong mutation. In the 16 SNPs of F5, frequencies of the G/T and T/T genotypes at Ser156Ser were significantly lower in patients than in controls (OR 0.45, 95% CI 0.22-0.91, OR 0.32, 95% CI 0.14-0.72) and the allele frequency of C at Leu1288Leu was significantly higher in patients than that in controls (OR 1.66, 95% CI 1.02-2.71). The mean FV:C values were not significantly different between patients and controls. However, the prevalence of patients with a high or low FV:C (>95th or <fifth percentile) was significantly greater than the controls (OR 3.59, 95% CI 1.11-11.60: OR 3.94, 95% CI 1.23-12.60). These results suggest that some SNPs of F5 and a high or low FV:C level might be associated with recurrent miscarriage. Copyright ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Therefore, we designed a retrospective cohort study of patients with residual hip dysplasia (RHD) who underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The objective of this study was to investigate an association between the MRI appearance of the labrum before school age and the natural history of RHD. We retrospectively investigated 45 hips of 40 patients who underwent MRI at about 3 and 4 years of age for RHD and were conservatively followed up with until 6 years of age or older. We evaluated the extent of eversion with a new method that measures the β angle (MRI β angle) using landmarks of the Graf method on MRI T2?-weighted images. The outcome measure was the Severin classification at the final follow-up. We compared the radiographic and MRI parameters at approximately 3 and 4 years of age between the good and poor outcome groups. The Student t test or one-way analysis of variance was used to compare the quantitative variables between groups. The Chi-square test was used to perform a ratio comparison. Although there was a significant difference in the center-edge (CE) angle, there was no significant difference in the acetabular index and the ratio of the presence of femoral head necrosis and the break in Shenton line between the good and poor groups. The MRI β angle was significantly greater in the poor outcome group than in the normal and good outcome groups. The cut-off value of the MRI β angle to differentiate the good and poor outcome groups was 65°, and its specificity and sensitivity were 92% and 53%, respectively. There was labral eversion on MRI scans in patients with RHD. Acetabular development before adolescence was poorer with greater labral eversion on MRI scans. The specificity for poor acetabular development was high when the MRI β angle was 65° or more. The MRI β angle has the potential to predict acetabular development. Copyright ? 2017 the Author(s).

The correlation between clinicopathological factors and prognosis about pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma patients who received its surgical resection has not been clearly identified. Methods: We retrospectively investigated the clinical records of 24 pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma patients who had a surgical resection from January 2004 to December 2013 at our institute. We examined the correlation between their clinicopathological factors and therapeutic effects including their prognosis. Results: The median follow up time was 2.3 years. The 5-year survival was 54.7% and the 5-year progression free survival was 52.4%. In comparison with other tissue types of lung cancer, the prognosis was not so poor even taking into consideration the survival curve including several progression stages. We analyzed the 21 clinicopathological factors in order to clarify the factors connected with the prognosis and disease progression. As a result, we found that both vascular invasion evaluated by immunohistochemistry and lymph node metastasis were connected closely with the overall survival. We found another strong link between the tissue type of epithelial components, vascular invasion evaluated by immunohistochemistry and lymph nodal metastasis with the progression free survival. Conclusions: Pulmonary pleomorphic carcinoma patients with lymph node metastasis and vascular invasion had worse prognosis after their surgical resections.

The present study aimed to investigate the impact of cognitive decline on health utility value in older adults suffering from cancer. Methods: Consecutive patients aged 65 years or older with a primary diagnosis of malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma were recruited. Patients were asked to complete the EuroQoL-5 (EQ-5D) scale to measure health utility and the Mini-Mental State Examination to assess cognitive decline. The potential impact of cognitive decline was investigated with univariate analysis. A multivariate regression analysis was conducted to control for potential confounding factors. Results: Complete data were obtained from 87 patients, 29% of whom had cognitive decline. The mean ± SE EQ-5D score for patients with cognitive decline was significantly lower than that for those without cognitive decline (0.67 ± 0.04 vs 0.79 ± 0.03, t = 2.38, P = 0.02). However, multiple regression analysis showed that cognitive decline was not significantly associated with EQ-5D scores. Female sex and lower performance scores (worse physical condition) were significantly associated with EQ-5D scores. Conclusions: Cognitive decline may be involved in decreased health utility value in older adult patients with cancer. However, this effect does not seem to be independent, and the patient's physical condition may be a relevant confounding factor. ? 2016 The Authors.

The most common thromboembolic events associated with COC were deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism and their combination. The reported thromboembolic events increased year by year, in association with an increase in the quantity of prescribed low-dose estrogen progestin after approval for health insurance coverage for dysmenorrhea in 2008 in Japan. The incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in Japanese COC users is estimated to be lower compared with their Western counterparts. In contrast, the frequency of all thromboembolic events peaked at 90 days from the start of COC, as in Western studies. The risk of VTE in the overweight group (body mass index ? 25?kg/m2) was more than twofold higher than in the standard group, and age-specific incidence rate rose sharply after the age of 40. There were different VTE risks according to progestin type in Japan as in Western countries, but a definite conclusion about risk according to progestin type was not able to be reached at present. As for the risk of arterial embolism and thrombosis, the difference by progestin type was small, but it became higher at ?50 years of age.

The expression of ERCC1 and TUBB3 proteins was examined in 40 thymic carcinoma patients who underwent either surgical resection or core-needle biopsy. The present study investigated whether the expression of ERCC1 and TUBB3 proteins was associated with the overall survival and clinicopathological factors of thymic carcinoma patients. The expression of ERCC1 and TUBB3 proteins was also evaluated in 50 patients who underwent curative resection for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression of ERCC1 and TUBB3 proteins was positive in 8 cases (20%) among the thymic carcinoma patients. ERCC1 was expressed in 21 cases (42%), while TUBB3 was expressed in 27 cases (54%), among the 50 NSCLC patients evaluated in the present study. Only complete resection was observed to be associated with a better prognosis than incomplete resection (P=0.0341). Other clinicopathological factors, including expression of ERCC1 and TUBB3 proteins, exhibited no effect on overall survival. The expression of ERCC1 and TUBB3 proteins in the thymic carcinoma cases was lower than that in the NSCLC cases.

We evaluated the impact of having a solitary kidney on tolerability to gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) chemotherapy in urothelial carcinoma patients. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients treated between August 2007 and November 2015. Eligible patients had received GC as first-line chemotherapy, including as neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment. Patients who commenced GC chemotherapy after nephroureterectomy comprised the solitary kidney (SK) group; the remaining patients (i.e., those with both kidneys) comprised the BK group. Incidences of hematologic toxicities and renal insufficiency were examined and compared between two groups. Results: There were 16 patients in the SK group and 31 in the BK group. The incidence of hematologic toxicity (grade 3/4) was not significantly different between the two groups (neutropenia: 68.8 vs. 74.2%, respectively (P = 0.959); thrombocytopenia: 31.2 vs. 51.6%, respectively (P = 0.307); and anemia: 12.5 vs. 38.7%, respectively (P = 0.094)). Multivariate analysis revealed no statistically significant association between having a SK and severe hematologic toxicities. Moreover, no significant differences were observed in the incidence of acute kidney injury. The mean differences in serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration rate between baseline and each post-chemotherapy cycle were similar when comparing the SK and BK groups. Conclusions: There is no evidence that tolerability to GC chemotherapy is inferior in patients with a solitary kidney. Therefore, there may be no need to avoid administering CDDP-based chemotherapy to such patients. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Cisplatin; Hematologic toxicities; Nephroureterectomy; Renal safety; Solitary kidney; Tolerability,"albumin; cisplatin; creatinine; gemcitabine; antineoplastic agent; antineoplastic antimetabolite; cisplatin; deoxycytidine; gemcitabine; acute kidney failure; adjuvant therapy; aged; albumin blood level; anemia; Article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; clinical article; controlled study; creatinine blood level; drug tolerability; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; male; medical record review; multiple cycle treatment; nephroureterectomy; neutropenia; priority journal; retrospective study; side effect; solitary kidney; thrombocytopenia; transitional cell carcinoma; treatment outcome; Acute Kidney Injury; analogs and derivatives; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell; chemically induced; kidney; middle aged; nephrectomy; neutropenia; pathophysiology; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Acute Kidney Injury; Aged; Antimetabolites, Antineoplastic; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Transitional Cell; Cisplatin; Deoxycytidine; Female; Humans; Kidney; Male; Middle Aged; Nephrectomy; Neutropenia; Retrospective Studies; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85017165366

Streptococcus pyogenes causes a variety of diseases, such as pharyngitis and toxic shock syndrome. In addition, this bacterium is a causative agent of balanoposthitis. To reveal the bacteriological characteristics of the isolates from balanoposthitis patients, we analysed 47 isolates. In addition, novel clade genotype emm89 S. pyogenes isolates have been reported to be spreading worldwide recently. Hence, we further analysed eight emm89 isolates. Methodology. A drug susceptibility experiment was performed and emm types were determined. More detailed experiments, such as PCR analysis for the presence of virulence-associated genes and MLST analysis, were performed especially using emm89 isolates. Results. All isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, but 34% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antibiotic. The emm types of the isolates varied, with emm89 and emm11 being the most prevalent, but the emm1 type was not detected. The analysis of emm89 isolates revealed that drug susceptibilities varied. All isolates were negative for the hasABC gene and produced active NADase that are characteristics of novel clade genotype emm89 S. pyogenes. MLST analysis demonstrated that six isolates were of the ST101 type, the most predominant type reported thus far, but two isolates were of the ST646 type. According to the PCR analysis used to determine the presence of streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin-related genes, the six ST101 isolates were further classified into four groups. Conclusion. These results suggest that balanoposthitis is caused by a variety of types of S. pyogenes, with novel clade genotype emm89 isolates playing a role in balanoposthitis infections in Japan. ? 2017 The Authors.",Balanoposthitis; Emm89; MLST; S. pyogenes,"amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ampicillin; azithromycin; bacterial protein; cefditoren pivoxil; cefepime; cefotaxime; cefotiam; cefozopran; ceftriaxone; chloramphenicol; clindamycin; cotrimoxazole; erythromycin; levofloxacin; meropenem; minocycline; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nucleosidase; penicillin G; protein erma; protein ermb; protein mefa; rifampicin; unclassified drug; vancomycin; ampicillin; bacterial DNA; erythrogenic toxin; exotoxin; adult; aged; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial gene; bacterium isolate; bacterium isolation; balanoposthitis; cladistics; clinical article; genotype; human; male; microbiological examination; middle aged; minimum inhibitory concentration; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; Streptococcus pyogenes; classification; DNA sequence; drug effects; genetics; isolation and purification; Japan; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; multidrug resistance; nucleotide sequence; prepuce; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes; Ampicillin; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; DNA, Bacterial; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Exotoxins; Foreskin; Humans; Japan; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes",2-s2.0-85018765673

The frequency of PS-Tokushima and the subsequent live birth rate in relation to a PS deficiency defined as low PS-specific activity (total PS activity/total PS antigen) and the carriage of PS-Tokushima were examined. Results and conclusions There was no significant difference in the frequency of PS-Tokushima between patients and controls. The 8 patients carriers of PS-Tokushima variant were capable of a subsequent live birth without the use of heparin. There was no significant difference in subsequent live birth rates between patients with low or normal PS-specific activity/PS activity without heparin prophylaxis after excluding miscarriages caused by an abnormal embryonic karyotype using multivariate logistic regression analysis.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of SRT in these patients. Methods: Fifty locally recurrent metastatic brain tumors in 47 patients were treated with SRT. The median prescribed dose of GKS was 20?Gy at the periphery. The median interval between the GKS (the last session in cases in which multiple GKS procedures were performed) and recurrence was 7.5 (range 1–33) months. Several dose-fractionation protocols were used for SRT, depending on the size and location of the tumor and previous GKS dose. The median prescribed dose of the SRT at the isocenter was 30?Gy with a median of ten fractions. Results: Among the 50 lesions treated with SRT, 26 did not recur locally before the patient’s death or the last follow-up examination, and 24 recurred locally. The median follow-up period for the surviving patients was 24?months after the first GKS procedure, and the overall survival rate was 80% at 1?year and 57% at 2?years. The median time to local re-recurrence after the SRT (16?months) was significantly longer than the median interval between the last GKS and recurrence (7.5?months; P?<?0.001).

METHODS Serum samples were collected from 165 patients with hematological malignancies to monitor titers of HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to HBV core (anti-HBc) and surface antigens. Serum samples negative for HBsAg and positive for anti-HBc were subjected to nucleic acid extraction and HBV DNA detection by real-time polymerase chain reaction. DNA sequences spanning the S region were analyzed in cases with occult HBV infection. In vitro comparative study of constructed 1.24-fold wild type and S protein mutant HBV genotype D clones was further performed. RESULTS HBV DNA was detected in 23 (42.6%) of 54 patients with hematological malignancies who were HBsAg negative, but anti-HBc positive, suggesting the presence of occult HBV infection. The complete HBV genome was retrieved from 6 occult HBV patients, and P120T and S143L were detected in 3 and 2 cases, respectively. Site directed mutagenesis was done to produce 1.24-fold genotype D clones with amino acid mutations T120 and L143. The in vitro analyses revealed that a lower level of extracellular HBsAg was detected by chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) with the clone containing T120 mutation, compared with the wild type or the clone with S143L mutation despite the similar levels of extracellular and intracellular HBsAg detected by Western blot. Southern blot experiments showed that the levels of intracellular HBV DNA were not different between these clones. CONCLUSION Occult HBV infection is common in patients with hematological malignancies and associated with P120T and S143L mutations. 120T mutation impairs the detection of HBsAg by CLEIA. ? 2017 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

However, few studies have assessed the immunogenicity of the influenza vaccine in these patients. Here, we performed a prospective study to evaluate the immunogenicity of the influenza vaccine in patients with lung cancer undergoing anticancer chemotherapy. Twenty-five patients with lung cancer undergoing anticancer chemotherapy and 26 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as controls were enrolled. A trivalent influenza vaccine containing inactivated A/California/7/2009 (H1N1) pdm09, A/Texas/50/2012 (H3N2), and B/Massachusetts/2/2012 was administered as a single subcutaneous injection. Serum samples were collected before vaccination, and at 4–6?weeks after vaccination. Levels of serum antibody to hemagglutinin were measured. Among patients with lung cancer, the seroprotection rate (postvaccination titer > 1:40) was 84% for both A(H1N1) and A(H3N2), similar to the levels observed in patients with COPD. However, the seroprotection rate for the B strain was significantly lower in patients with lung cancer than in patients with COPD (64% versus 92%). Even after adjustment for potential confounders, patients with lung cancer had a significantly lower odds ratio for seroprotection against the B strain than patients with COPD. Moreover, in patients with lung cancer, those receiving the platinum doublet treatment tended to exhibit a lower seroprotection rate than those receiving a single agent. Thus, patients with lung cancer undergoing anticancer chemotherapy showed acceptable immune responses to a trivalent influenza vaccine, supporting the recommendation for annual influenza vaccination in these patients. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis.",anticancer chemotherapy; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; immunogenicity; influenza vaccine; lung cancer,"amrubicin; cisplatin; docetaxel; etoposide; gemcitabine; gimeracil plus oteracil potassium plus tegafur; influenza vaccine; paclitaxel; pemetrexed; platinum; triple vaccine; vinorelbine tartrate; antineoplastic agent; influenza vaccine; virus antibody; aged; antibody titer; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer staging; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; human; immune response; immunogenicity; influenza; influenza vaccination; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; single drug dose; blood; complication; hemagglutination inhibition test; immunology; Influenza A virus (H1N1); Influenza A virus (H3N2); Influenza B virus; Influenza, Human; Lung Neoplasms; middle aged; prospective study; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antibodies, Viral; Antineoplastic Agents; Female; Hemagglutination Inhibition Tests; Humans; Influenza A Virus, H1N1 Subtype; Influenza A Virus, H3N2 Subtype; Influenza B virus; Influenza Vaccines; Influenza, Human; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies",2-s2.0-85009957595

Methods: Patients’ records from January 2009 to March 2013 were retrospectively reviewed, and 3469 patients with localized prostate cancer were identified at 45 institutions. Individual surgeon's experience with nerve sparing was recorded as the number of nerve sparing cases among total robot-assisted radical prostatectomies beginning with the first case during which nerve sparing was carried out. Patients were selected by propensity score matching for nerve sparing, and predictive factors of positive surgical margins were analyzed in patients with and without positive surgical margins. Results: A total of 152 surgeons were studied, and the median number of robot-assisted radical prostatectomy cases for all surgeons was 21 (range 1–511). In all, 54 surgeons (35.5%) undertook nerve sparing during their first robot-assisted radical prostatectomy case. For 2388 patients selected with (1194) and without (1194) nerve sparing, predictive factors for positive surgical margin were high initial prostate-specific antigen level (P?<?0.0001), high biopsy Gleason score (P?=?0.0379), presence of neoadjuvant hormone therapy (P?=?0.0002) and surgeon's experience with >100 cases (P?=?0.0058). Thus, nerve sparing was not associated with positive surgical margins. Conclusion: The surgeon's experience influences the occurrence of positive surgical margins, although a considerable number of surgeons carried out nerve sparing during their early robot-assisted radical prostatectomy cases.

Although many patients with PA have been identified by tandem mass spectrometry since the test was first included in neonatal mass screening in the 1990s, the disease severity varies. Thus, determining the specific level of PCC activity is considered to be helpful to grasp the severity of PA. We developed a new PCC assay method by the determination of methylmalonyl-CoA, which is formed by an enzyme reaction using peripheral lymphocytes, based on ultra high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC–MS/MS). With methylmalonyl-CoA concentrations of 0.05, 0.5, and 5?μmol/L, the intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were 8.2%, 8.7%, and 5.1%, respectively, and the inter-assay CVs were 13.6%, 10.5%, and 5.9%, respectively. The PCC activities of 20 healthy individuals and 6 PA patients were investigated with this assay. Methylmalonyl-CoA was not detected in one PA patient with a severe form of the disease, but the remaining PA patients with mild disease showed residual activities (3.3–7.8%). These results demonstrate that determination of PCC activity with this assay would be useful to distinguish between mild and severe cases of PA to help choose an appropriate treatment plan. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Methylmalonyl coenzyme A; Propionic acidemia; Propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase; UPLC–MS/MS,"Chromatography; Coenzymes; High performance liquid chromatography; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometry; Spectrometry; Coefficients of variations; Coenzyme A; Healthy individuals; Metabolic disease; Peripheral lymphocytes; Propionic; Tandem mass spectrometry; Ultra-high performance liquid chromatographies; Diagnosis; coenzyme A; methylmalonyl coenzyme A; propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase; unclassified drug; methylmalonyl coenzyme A decarboxylase; Article; child; clinical article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; disease severity; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; enzyme mechanism; female; human; human cell; infant; male; newborn; peripheral lymphocyte; preschool child; priority journal; propionic acidemia; school child; tandem mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; adult; blood; case control study; enzymology; high performance liquid chromatography; limit of detection; metabolism; procedures; propionic acidemia; reproducibility; statistical model; tandem mass spectrometry; young adult; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Child; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Limit of Detection; Linear Models; Male; Methylmalonyl-CoA Decarboxylase; Propionic Acidemia; Reproducibility of Results; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85011900706

However, conventional HBsAg assays have so far failed to accurately detect HBsAg in blood because of interference by patient-derived antibodies against HBsAg (HBsAb). Methods: We developed a novel, fully automated assay system that can detect total HBsAg in blood, including antigens complexed with HBsAb. The immunoassay inactivates HBsAb via a simple pretreatment step to dissociate the HBsAg molecule from HBsAg–HBsAb complexes and thereby estimate total HBsAg. Accordingly, the test has been termed the “immunoassay for total antigen including complex via pretreatment (iTACT)-HBsAg.” Results: The recovery rate of HBsAg in the presence of HBsAb was greater than 87?% at a cutoff value set at 5.0?mIU/mL on the basis of data from 545 healthy controls. Analyses using serial serum samples from 25 HBV carriers who became negative for HBsAg during follow-up showed that the iTACT-HBsAg could detect HBsAg over a period of years despite a loss in detection by conventional assays and was able to detect HBsAg in 39 (53?%) of 73 samples with HBsAb. Conclusions: The new iTACT-HBsAg assay appears to detect total HBsAg with high sensitivity, even in the presence of HBsAb, and may useful in identifying subclinical or occult HBV carriers. ? 2016, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Hepatitis B surface antigen; Immunoassay; Immunoassay for total antigen including complex via pretreatment,"hepatitis B surface antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; antigen antibody complex; biological marker; hepatitis B antibody; hepatitis B surface antigen; adult; aged; antigen antibody complex; antigen detection; Article; blood sampling; chemiluminescence immunoassay kit; chemoluminescence; complex formation; controlled study; female; follow up; gel filtration chromatography; hepatitis B; Hepatitis B virus; human; immunoassay; male; nonhuman; priority journal; virus carrier; virus genome; antigen antibody complex; blood; enzyme immunoassay; evaluation study; hepatitis B; heterozygote; middle aged; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; size exclusion chromatography; specimen handling; Adult; Aged; Antigen-Antibody Complex; Biomarkers; Carrier State; Chromatography, Gel; Female; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B Antibodies; Hepatitis B Surface Antigens; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Male; Middle Aged; Sensitivity and Specificity; Specimen Handling",2-s2.0-84979680206

We found that Tat could deliberately change the local flexibility of CycT1. Although the structural coordinates of the H1 and H2 helices did not substantially change, H10 , H20 , and H30 exhibited significant changes en masse. Consequently, the CycT1 residues involved in Tat binding, namely Tat-recognition residues (TRRs), lost their flexibility with the addition of Tat to P-TEFb. In addition, we clarified the structural variation of CDK9 in complex with CycT1 in the presence or absence of Tat. Interestingly, Tat addition significantly reduced the structural variability of the T-loop, thus consolidating the structural integrity of P-TEFb. Finally, we deciphered the formation of the hidden catalytic cavity of CDK9 upon Tat binding. MD simulation revealed that the PITALRE signature sequence of CDK9 flips the inactive kinase cavity of CDK9 into the active form by connecting with Thr186, which is crucial for its activity, thus presumably recruiting the substrate peptide such as the C-terminal domain of RNA pol II.

However, the compliance of adjuvant therapy is relatively low, and the prognosis for those patients has been unsatisfactory. Therefore, we conducted a phase II study of induction chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery with the aim of improving the survival. Patients and methods This treatment strategy consisted of induction chemotherapy (two cycles of cisplatin at 80?mg/m2 on Day 1 and vinorelbine at 20?mg/m2 on Days 1 and 8) concurrent with radiotherapy (40?Gy in 20 fractions) followed by surgery. The inclusion criteria were patients with resectable T3N0-1M0 NSCLC involving the chest wall who were 20–70 years of age. The primary end point was the 3-year survival, assuming an expected rate of 67%. Results From January 2009 to November 2012, 51 eligible patients were enrolled. Induction therapy was completed as planned in 49 (96%) patients without treatment-related death, and 25 (51%) had a partial response. Complete resection combined with the involved chest wall was achieved in 46 (92%) patients, and a pathologic complete response was seen in 13 (26%) patients. Five patients experienced major postoperative complications, and 1 patient died of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia. With a median follow-up period of 42 months, the 3- and 5-year overall survivals of all registered patients were 77% and 63%, respectively. There was a significant difference in the survival rate between patients with a pathologic complete response and those with a residual tumor (p?=?0.039). Conclusion The mature results of this study in a multi-institutional setting showed the treatment strategy to be safe and effective with a high rate of pathologic response for patients with NSCLC involving the chest wall. ? 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Chest wall; Clinical trials; Induction therapy; Lung cancer; Lung cancer surgery; Radiation therapy,"antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; recombinant granulocyte colony stimulating factor; vinorelbine tartrate; antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; vinblastine; vinorelbine tartrate; acute kidney failure; adult; adult respiratory distress syndrome; aged; Article; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer surgery; chemoradiotherapy; controlled study; disease exacerbation; distant metastasis; female; follow up; human; induction chemotherapy; interstitial pneumonia; leukopenia; long term survival; lung adenocarcinoma; lung resection; lung tumor; major clinical study; male; metastasis; middle aged; minimal residual disease; multicenter study; multimodality cancer therapy; multiple cycle treatment; neutropenia; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; phase 2 clinical trial; postoperative complication; postoperative hemorrhage; priority journal; prospective study; radiation dose fractionation; rib; risk factor; small cell lung cancer; squamous cell lung carcinoma; survival rate; thoracotomy; thorax wall; treatment response; analogs and derivatives; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; clinical trial; induction chemotherapy; Lung Neoplasms; mortality; neoadjuvant therapy; pathology; procedures; thorax wall; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Chemoradiotherapy; Cisplatin; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Induction Chemotherapy; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoadjuvant Therapy; Neoplasm Staging; Prospective Studies; Survival Rate; Thoracic Wall; Treatment Outcome; Vinblastine",2-s2.0-85007152028

This cross-sectional survey involved 176 remnant plasma samples collected from consenting HIV patients (median age 35 [18–74]) between June and September 2014. HBV seromarkers were determined by high-sensitivity chemiluminescence assays. Molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted on the basal core promoter/precore (BCP/PC) and S regions of HBV, as well as part of the HIV pol region. Of the 176 participants (65.7% female), 19 (10.8%) were positive for HBsAg (median 0.033 IU/ml (IQR 0.01–415). The HBsAg incidence was higher in men than women (P = 0.009). HBsAg-positive subjects had lower median CD4 counts (P = 0.016). HBV DNA was detectable in 12 HBsAg-positive samples (median 3.36 log cp/ml (2.86–4.51), seven being amplified and sequenced. All isolates were subgenotype A1 without HBV drug resistance mutations but each had at least one BCP/PC mutation. PreS deletion mutants and small S antigen variants M133I/T and D144G were identified. Of the 164 HIV isolates successfully genotyped, 163 (99.4%) were HIV-1 subtype C and only one was HIV-1 subtype F1. Sixteen (9.8%) had at least one drug resistance mutation, predominantly non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-related mutations, observed mostly among female participants. This study shows that co-infection with HBV is present among HIV patients enrolling into HIV care in Zimbabwe, suggesting that HBV screening and monitoring programmes be strengthened in this context.

Methods: This is a 3-month, open-label, single-arm, multicentre, phase III study. Thirty-one patients (15 BRVO and 16 CRVO) aged ?18?years with a best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) letter score of 19–73 (BRVO) or 24–73 (CRVO) were included. The primary end-point was the mean average change in BCVA from baseline to month 1 through month 3 after three consecutive monthly intravitreal injections of ranibizumab 0.5?mg. Secondary end-points were mean change in BCVA and central subfield thickness (CSFT), categorized BCVA, and safety over 3?months. Results: At month 3, the mean average change in BCVA improved substantially from baseline for BRVO (11.3 letters, p?=?0.001) and CRVO (6.7 letters, p?=?0.019). The mean BCVA improved (12.8 and 9.1 letters) and the mean CSFT decreased (212.5 and 442.1?μm) from baseline to month 3. At month 3, 26.7% (BRVO) and 31.3% (CRVO) of the patients had a gain of ?15 letters from baseline. Safety findings in this study were similar to those reported in the previous clinical trials. Conclusion: Ranibizumab was effective in improving BCVA and was well tolerated in Japanese patients with BRVO and CRVO.

Methods Patients with stage III or IV glottic or supraglottic squamous cell carcinoma were enrolled. ACRT consisted of two cycles of chemotherapy involving 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin (weeks 1 and 6) and radiotherapy (RT; weeks 2 and 7) administered alternately. An early assessment was performed after one cycle of chemotherapy and RT. Patients with a partial response (PR) or a complete response at early assessment continued ACRT. Patients with stable disease (SD) or progressive disease at early assessment discontinued ACRT and underwent salvage surgery. After completion of ACRT, patients who had residual primary tumor and lymph metastasis underwent salvage surgery. Results Twenty-eight patients were enrolled in this trial. Median follow-up was 60.0 months. After each cycle of chemotherapy and RT, 24 of the 28 patients (85.7%) were assessed as having a PR at early assessment and continued ACRT, and 4 of 28 patients (14.3%) who were assessed as having SD at early assessment discontinued ACRT and underwent salvage surgery. The estimated 5-year local control and 5-year survival rates were 49.0% and 77.4%, respectively. Larynx preservation was achieved in 17 patients. The estimated 5-year laryngeal preservation rate was 59.4%. Major toxicity included nausea, stomatitis, dermatitis, dysphagia and hemoglobin toxicity.

Daclatasvir (DCV) plus asunaprevir (ASV) have been shown to be highly effective for HCV-infected patients with genotype 1b. Three patients co-infected with HIV/HCV genotype 1b were enrolled in this study. Prior to initiation of HCV treatment, the variants associated with L31 and Y93 in the non-structural protein 5A (NS5A) region of the HCV genome were confirmed to be absent using a direct sequencing method. Taking into consideration the lower risk of drug–drug interaction and the need for immediate treatment, the patients received 60?mg DCV once daily plus 100?mg ASV twice daily for 24?weeks. In one patient, the alanine aminotransferase level was elevated to 228?IU/L at 24?weeks after the start of treatment, but he completed the 24-week treatment course.

Materials and Methods: Fifty-four patients, 32 males and 22 females with a median age of 68?years (range 43–82?years), underwent PTPI. The procedures consisted of 33 percutaneous transhepatic portal vein embolizations, 19 percutaneous transhepatic variceal embolizations, and 2 percutaneous transhepatic portal venous stent placements. Two patients with gastric varices underwent percutaneous transhepatic variceal embolization twice because of recurrence. Therefore, the total number of procedures was 56. Among them, hepatic arterial injury occurred in 6 PTPIs in 5 patients, and TAE was performed. We assessed technical success, complications related to TAE, and clinical outcome. Technical success was defined as the disappearance of findings due to hepatic arterial injury on digital subtraction angiography. Results: As hepatic arterial injuries, 4 extravasations and 2 arterioportal shunts developed. All TAEs were performed successfully. The technical success rate was 100?%. Complication of TAE occurred in 5 of 6 TAEs; 3 were focal liver infarction, not requiring further treatment, and 2 were biloma that required percutaneous drainage. Five TAEs in 4 patients were performed immediately after the PTPI, and these 4 patients were alive. However, one TAE was performed 10?h later, and the patient died due to multiple organ failure 2?months later although TAE was successful. Conclusion: TAE is a useful treatment for hepatic arterial injury related to PTPI. However, it should be performed at an early stage. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York and the Cardiovascular and Interventional Radiological Society of Europe (CIRSE).",Bleeding; Complication; Embolization; Percutaneous transhepatic portal intervention,"gelatin sponge; adult; aged; arterial embolization; artery injury; Article; biloma; clinical assessment; clinical outcome; digital subtraction angiography; embolization coil; extravasation; female; human; liver injury; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multiple organ failure; percutaneous drainage; percutaneous transhepatic portal intervention; portosystemic anastomosis; priority journal; recurrent disease; retrospective study; stomach varices; very elderly; adverse effects; artificial embolization; catheterization; hepatic artery; hepatic portal vein; injuries; procedures; treatment outcome; Vascular System Injuries; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Catheterization; Embolization, Therapeutic; Female; Hepatic Artery; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Portal Vein; Treatment Outcome; Vascular System Injuries",2-s2.0-84988697035

Methods: This prospective, cross-sectional study included patients diagnosed with EE by upper gastrointestinal endoscopy between October 2014 and March 2015 at 106 Japanese hospitals. Data on medical history, general condition, gastrointestinal symptoms, lifestyle habits, comorbidities, and endoscopic findings were collected using a standard form to create a dedicated database. Logistic regression analysis was used to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95%CI for the association with complicated EE. Results: During the study period, 1749 patients diagnosed with EE, 38.3% of whom were prescribed proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) were included. Of them, 143 (8.2%) had EE complications.

Analyzing associated factors with each EE complication separately showed esophageal ulcer bleeding were associated with increased age (aOR: 1.05; 95%CI: 1.02-1.07) and Los Angeles grades B (aOR: 3.60; 95%CI: 1.52-8.50), C (aOR: 27.61; 95%CI: 12.34-61.80), and D (aOR: 119.09; 95%CI: 51.15-277.29), while esophageal strictures were associated with increased age (aOR: 1.07; 95%CI: 1.04-1.10), gastroesophageal reflux symptom (aOR: 2.51; 95%CI: 1.39-4.51), concomitant use of psychotropic agents (aOR: 11.79; 95%CI: 5.06-27.48), Los Angeles grades C (aOR: 7.35; 95%CI: 3.32-16.25), and D (aOR: 20.34; 95%CI: 8.36-49.53) and long-segment Barrett's esophagus (aOR: 4.63; 95%CI: 1.64-13.05). Conclusion: Aging and severe EE were common associated factors, although there were more associated factors in esophageal strictures than esophageal ulcer bleeding. Despite the availability and widespread use of PPIs, EE complications are likely to remain a problem in Japan owing to the aging population and high-stress society. ? 2017 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.

We developed monoclonal antibodies against human CXADR and found that one antibody (6G10A) significantly inhibited the growth of subcutaneous as well as orthotopic xenografts of human prostate cancer cells in vivo. Furthermore, 6G10A also inhibited other cancer xenografts expressing CXADR, such as pancreatic and colorectal cancer cells. Knockdown and overexpression of CXADR confirmed the dependence of its anti-tumor activity on CXADR expression. Our studies of its action demonstrated that 6G10A exerted its anti-tumor activity primarily through both antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity. Moreover, 6G10A reacted with human tumor tissues, such as prostate, lung, and brain, each of which express CXADR. Although we need further evaluation of its reactivity and safety in human tissues, our results show that a novel anti-CXADR antibody may be a feasible candidate for cancer immunotherapy. ?

Methods: Consecutive patients with RA, who resumed a TNFi to treat flares after initial TNFi-free remission and discontinued a TNFi again after achieving remission and adding tacrolimus were enrolled. The lengths of remission after discontinuation of TNFi without or with tacrolimus were analyzed. Results: Thirteen TNFi-free periods in six patients, in which seven were without and six were with tacrolimus were analyzed. All were seropositive females with a median age of 46 years and symptom duration of 1.2 years at the onset of TNFi therapy. Two were treated with infliximab and four were with etanercept. The median dose of tacrolimus was 2 mg/day with trough level of 4.5 ng/ml. The length of time to flare after discontinuation of TNFi therapy with tacrolimus was significantly longer than those without tacrolimus (median 107 weeks [range 4–207] versus 13 weeks [2–36]). After adding tacrolimus, only one patient resumed TNFi therapy and three had no flare until final observation. Conclusions: Add-on tacrolimus was effective in maintaining TNFi-free remission in patients with RA who ever relapsed after TNFi-free remission. ? 2016 Japan College of Rheumatology.",Remission; rheumatoid arthritis; tacrolimus; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor,C reactive protein; leflunomide; methotrexate; prednisolone; stromelysin; tacrolimus; triamcinolone; tumor necrosis factor inhibitor; add on therapy; adult; Article; clinical article; DAS28; disease duration; drug withdrawal; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; female; Health Assessment Questionnaire; human; middle aged; observational study; priority journal; remission; retrospective study; rheumatoid arthritis; treatment duration,2-s2.0-84965082124

OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between characteristics of calcified carotid plaque and recurrent stenosis after CEA, as well as the disease's natural course. METHODS: Ninety-four plaques out of 107 consecutive CEAs were retrospectively analyzed with regard to calcification, employing calcium score as well as shape, location, and other characteristics of original plaques. CEA was performed in a standard fashion with primary closure using an internal shunt. Restenosis was assessed by direct measurement of stenosis mainly using multidetector row computed tomography (CT) angiography. RESULTS: Univariate analysis revealed that calcium score and calcification circularity score were significantly lower in more than moderate restenosis (?50%; 422.1 ± 551.6 vs 84.2 ± 92.0, P < .001; 1.8 ± 1.3 vs 1.1 ± 0.3, P < .001, respectively). Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated a calcium score of 80, which was the optimal cutoff value for restenosis over 50% (sensitivity 0.70, specificity 0.68, pseudopositive ratio 0.32, area under curve 0.71, Youden's index 0.38). Low calcium score (OR 2.88, CI 1.06-7.79, P = .04) and low calcification circularity (OR 5.72, CI 1.42-23.1, P = .01) were independent predictors for more than moderate recurrent carotid stenosis 1 year postoperatively. Cases with decreasing tendency of restenosis showed higher calcium scores than those with increasing or unchanged tendency (217.2 ± 245.3 vs 164.5 ± 155.5, P < .001). Lower calcium score cases showed lower restenosis-free survival. CONCLUSION: Carotid plaque calcification may be inversely associated with recurrent stenosis 1 year after CEA or later. Preoperative CT assessment for less calcification will benefit restenosis patients by early prediction and close follow-up.

This study aimed to determine whether donor gender affects levels of serum terminal complement component C5a and oxidative stress in pediatric living related liver transplantation (LRLTx) recipients. Material/Methods: The subjects were 43 patients (20 males and 23 females) who underwent LRLTx during childhood (age range 1.2 years to 14.4 years; mean age 5 years). Serum samples were taken during the patients’ regular outpatient visits after LRLTx. Serum C5a was measured using the specific human C5a ELISA kit. Serum total hydroperoxide (TH) and biological antioxidative potential (BAP) were measured using the free radical analytic system, and the oxidative stress index (OSI) was calculated as the ratio of TH to BAP. Serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (GPT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (γGTP), and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were also measured as part of a typical outpatient examination for such patients. Results: C5a serum levels were higher in the 29 recipients who received their grafted livers from female donors than in the 14 recipients who received their grafted livers from male donors. Recipients who received their grafted livers from female donors had higher incidence of post-LTx (liver transplantation) complications. Female recipients from female donors showed the highest serum GPT and GOT levels, but this difference was only significant when compared to the female recipients from male donors (41.4±9.8 IU/L vs. 17.3±1.8 IU/L for GPT and 42.2±7.5 IU/L vs. 23.4±2.2 IU/L for GOT; P<0.05). Conclusions: Pediatric LRLTx patients who receive their grafts from female donors exhibit higher levels of serum C5a that probably plays a role in the immunological response against grafted livers from female donors in LTx. ?

However, the clinical value of serum HGF (sHGF) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), especially those receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy, remains unknown. Here, we show that sHGF may be useful to predict tumor response and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients with advanced NSCLC. A total of 81 patients with NSCLC were investigated. sHGF levels were evaluated using ELISA at 4 time-points: at pre-treatment, at response-evaluation (1-2 months after treatment initiation), at the best tumor response, and at disease progression. As a control biomarker, CEA was also evaluated in lung adenocarcinoma. Positive-sHGF at response-evaluation predicted poor PFS compared with Negative-sHGF in both first-line (median, 153.5 vs. 288.0; P < 0.05) and second-line treatment (87.0 vs. 219.5; P = 0.01). In 55 patients that received cytotoxic chemotherapy, multiple Cox proportional hazards models showed significant independent associations between poor PFS and Positive-sHGF at response-evaluation (hazard ratio, 4.24; 95% CI, 2.05 to 9.46; P < 0.01). Lung adenocarcinoma subgroup analysis showed that in patients receiving second cytotoxic chemotherapy, there were no significant differences in PFS between patients with low-CEA compared with those with high-CEA, but PositivesHGF at pre-treatment or at response-evaluation predicted poor PFS (35.0 vs. 132.0; P < 0.01, 50.0 vs. 215.0; P < 0.01, respectively). These findings give a rationale for future research investigating the merit of sHGF as a potential clinical biomarker to evaluate HGF/c-MET activity, which would be useful to indicate administration of c-MET inhibitors. ?

However, GIST can acquire resistance to imatinib within several years of therapy. The development of oncolytic reovirus as an anticancer agent has expanded to many clinical trials for various tumors. Here, we investigated whether reovirus has antitumor activity against GIST cells in the setting of imatinib sensitivity in vitro and in vivo. Cell proliferation and apoptosis assays were performed using a human GIST cell line, GIST-T1, and imatinib-resistant GIST (GIST-IR) cells that we established. The molecular pathways responsible for cell damage by reovirus were explored using PCR-arrays and Western blots. Reovirus significantly induced apoptotic cell death in GIST-T1 and GIST-IR cells in vitro, despite differences in the activation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways between GIST-T1 and GIST-IR. Molecular assays indicated the possibility that reovirus induces apoptotic cell death via Fas signaling. Furthermore, in vivo mouse tumor xenograft models demonstrated a significant antitumor effect of reovirus on both GIST-T1 and GIST-IR cells.

Between February 2005 and September 2015, 41 patients with intracranial meningiomas were treated with CyberKnife-based SRS or hSRT. Eleven of those tumors were located in the skull base. The median tumor volume was 10.4 ml (range, 1.4-56.9 ml).

This retrospective review analyzed clinical data from 97 patients who had undergone surgery for unilateral acoustic neuroma via the retrosigmoid approach >1 year previously. We investigated whether patients had headache at hospital discharge and during attendance at outpatient clinics. We classified postoperative headache as grade 0 (no headache), 1 (tolerable headache without medication), or 2 (headache requiring medication). The period of headache was defined as the interval in days between surgery and achievement of grade 0. The period of medication for headache was defined as the interval in days between surgery and achievement of grade 0 or 1. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed median durations of medication and headache of 81 and 641 days, respectively. Headache was cured significantly earlier in patients who underwent surgery using a C-type skin incision (P < 0.001). Headache persisted significantly longer among patients who underwent a shorter surgical procedure (P < 0.02). Multivariate analysis confirmed the type of skin incision as a factor independently associated with duration of postoperative headache.

Although adrenomedullin (ADM) has a number of physiological and vasoprotective functions, there are few studies of the ADM receptor system in humans. The ADM receptor comprises a calcitonin-receptor-like receptor (CLR) and receptor activity-modifying proteins (RAMPs). We analyzed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the RAMP2 and CLR genes to determine their association with stroke in the light of gene-environment interactions. Methods: Using cross-sectional data from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study in the baseline surveys, 14,087 participants from 12 research areas were genotyped. We conducted a hypothesis-based association between stroke prevalence and SNPs in the RAMP2 and CLR genes based on data abstracted from two SNPs in RAMP2 and 369 SNPs in CLR. We selected five SNPs from among the CLR variants (rs77035639, rs3815524, rs75380157, rs574603859, and rs147565266) and one RAMP2 SNP (rs753152), which were associated with stroke, for analysis. Results: Five of the SNPs (rs77035639, rs3815524, rs75380157, rs147565266, and rs753152) showed no significant association with obesity, ischemic heart disease, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and diabetes. In the logistic regression analysis, rs574603859 had a lower odds ratio (0.238; 95% confidence interval, 0.076-0.745, adjusted for age, sex, and research area) and the other SNPs had higher odds ratios for association with stroke. Conclusions: This was the first study to investigate the relationships between ADM receptor genes (RAMP2 and CLR) and stroke in the light of gene-environment interactions in human. ?

The aim of this study was to elucidate the characteristics and reliability of built-in step counting sensors on smartphones for development of an easy-to-use objective measurement tool that can be applied in ergonomics or epidemiological research. Methods: To evaluate the reliability of step counting sensors embedded in seven major smartphone models, the 6-minute walk test was conducted and the following analyses of sensor precision and accuracy were performed: 1) relationship between actual step count and step count detected by sensors, 2) reliability between smartphones of the same model, and 3) false detection rates when sitting during office work, while riding the subway, and driving. Results: On five of the seven models, the inter-class correlations coefficient (ICC (3,1)) showed high reliability with a range of 0.956-0.993. The other two models, however, had ranges of 0.443-0.504 and the relative error ratios of the sensor-detected step count to the actual step count were ±48.7%-49.4%. The level of agreement between the same models was ICC (3,1): 0.992-0.998. The false detection rates differed between the sitting conditions. Conclusions: These results suggest the need for appropriate regulation of step counts measured by sensors, through means such as correction or calibration with a predictive model formula, in order to obtain the highly reliable measurement results that are sought in scientific investigation.",Gait measurement; Inter-class correlations coefficient; Physical activity; Physical inactivity; Reliability; Smartphone,accelerometry; adult; analysis of variance; exercise; human; Japan; male; procedures; reproducibility; rest; sedentary lifestyle; smartphone; standards; walking; young adult; Accelerometry; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Exercise; Humans; Japan; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Rest; Sedentary Lifestyle; Smartphone; Walking; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85035139031

However, there is currently insufficient evidence to strongly recommend induction chemotherapy. In this study, we analyzed the outcomes for patients treated with induction chemotherapy and subsequent definitive treatments. Methods: Operable patients with untreated oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma treated with induction chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. We conducted induction chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil and performed subsequent surgical treatment or radiotherapy according to the response to induction chemotherapy. Results: A total of 65 patients were included in this study, and 50 patients (76.9%) had Stage IV tumors. The response to induction chemotherapy was CR in two patients, PR in 55 patients, and SD in eight patients. The subsequent definitive treatment was radiotherapy in 60 patients, and surgery in five patients. The 3-year overall survival rates for patients who received radiotherapy and surgery were 88.4% and 75.0%, respectively (P = 0.30). The 3-year disease-free survival rates for patients who received radiotherapy and surgery were 68.0% and 0%, respectively (P = 0.01). The 3-year laryngeal dysfunction free survival rates for patients who received RT and surgery were 77.8% and 0%, respectively (P < 0.01). Conclusions: We achieved favorable survival outcomes and high larynx preservation rates. Our results suggest that induction chemotherapy using TPF regimen is one of the optimal treatment strategies when treating head and neck cancers. Further prospective studies with a larger cohort are required to confirm our findings. ? The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press.

Hyperglycemia induces the formation and accumulation of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), which in turn stimulate vascular superoxide production. The mechanism underlying AGE-mediated vascular superoxide production remains to be clarified in lower limb complications associated with diabetes. In the present study, we investigated the role of AGEs and the mitochondrial respiratory complex in superoxide production in femoral arteries using the type 2 diabetes model Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats [vs. non-diabetic Long-Evans Tokushima Otsuka (LETO) rats]. The effects of in vivo administration of pravastatin on superoxide production in femoral arteries were also examined. Using chemiluminescent assays, luminescence microscopy, and competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), we determined that vascular superoxide production and serum glyceraldehyde-derived AGEs (Glycer-AGEs) increased in OLETF rats. Pravastatin inhibited these responses without changing serum total cholesterol concentrations. The mitochondrial complex II inhibitor thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTFA) also inhibited vascular superoxide production. Application of Glycer-AGEs in situ increased superoxide production in the vascular wall of femoral arteries from pravastatintreated OLETF rats, which was then inhibited by TTFA. These results suggest that hyperglycemia increases serum Glycer-AGEs, which subsequently induce superoxide production in the femoral artery of OLETF rats in a mitochondrial complex II-dependent manner. Collectively, our results have partially elucidated the pathological mechanisms leading to diabetes-related PAD, and indicate dual beneficial actions of pravastatin for the prevention of oxidative damage to the vascular wall. ? 2017 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Advanced glycation end-product; Mitochondria; Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rat; Pravastatin; Superoxide; Type 2 diabetes,"advanced glycation end product; cholesterol; glyceraldehyde; pravastatin; superoxide; thenoyltrifluoroacetone; advanced glycation end product; cholesterol; glyceraldehyde; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; pravastatin; superoxide; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; blood vessel wall; controlled study; femoral artery; heart protection; hyperglycemia; in vivo study; male; mitochondrion; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima fatty rat; peripheral occlusive artery disease; rat; analysis; animal; blood; drug effect; femoral artery; glucose blood level; Long Evans rat; metabolism; mitochondrion; Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima fatty rat; Animals; Blood Glucose; Cholesterol; Femoral Artery; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Glyceraldehyde; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Male; Mitochondria; Pravastatin; Rats, Inbred OLETF; Rats, Long-Evans; Superoxides",2-s2.0-85034071770

Methods and Results: In streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, plasma HDL decreased while ABCA1 protein increased without changing its mRNA in the liver, only in the animals that responded to the treatment to show hypoinsulinemia and fasting hyperglycemia but not in the poor responders not showing those. To study the mechanism for this finding, hepatocytes were isolated from the control and diabetic mice, and they showed no difference in expression of ABCA1 protein, its mRNA, and HDL biogenesis in 1 g/lD-glucose but showed decreased HDL biogenesis in 4.5 g/lD-glucose although ABCA1 protein increased without change in its mRNA. Similar findings were confirmed in HepG2 cells withD-glucose but not withL-glucose. Thus, these cell models reproduced the in vivo findings in hyperglycemia. Labeling of cell surface protein revealed that surface ABCA1 decreased in high concentration ofD-glucose in HepG2 cells despite the increase of cellular ABCA1 while not withL-glucose. Immunostaining of ABCA1 in HepG2 cells demonstrated the decrease of surface ABCA1 but increase of intracellular ABCA1 with highD-glucose. Clearance of ABCA1 was retarded both in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells exposed to highD-glucose but not toL-glucose, being consistent with the decrease of surface ABCA1. Conclusions: It is suggested that localization of ABCA1 to the cell surface is decreased in hepatocytes in hyperglycemic condition to cause decrease of HDL biogenesis. ? 2017 Japan Atherosclerosis Society.",ABCA1; Atherosclerosis; Cholesterol; Diabetes Mellitus; HDL; Hyperglycemia,"ABC transporter A1; glucose; glucose regulated protein 78; high density lipoprotein; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; insulin; messenger RNA; ABC transporter A1; ABCA1 protein, mouse; glucose; high density lipoprotein; sweetening agent; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; Article; biogenesis; controlled study; Hep-G2 cell line; high performance liquid chromatography; human; human cell; hyperglycemia; hypoinsulinemia; immunofluorescence test; liver cell; liver cell culture; male; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas islet beta cell; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; protein expression; real time polymerase chain reaction; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; ultracentrifugation; Western blotting; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; cell culture; drug effect; experimental diabetes mellitus; gene expression regulation; liver cell; metabolism; pathology; Animals; ATP Binding Cassette Transporter 1; Cells, Cultured; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Gene Expression Regulation; Glucose; Hepatocytes; Lipoproteins, HDL; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Sweetening Agents",2-s2.0-85032992341

Secreted Reelin binds to lipoprotein receptors expressed on neurons. The Reelin-receptor interaction induces phosphorylation of an intracellular adaptor protein Dab1, which is required for normal embryonic brain development and adult brain functions. It has been suggested that Reelin hypofunction plays a role in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia, autism, and Alzheimer’s disease. Thus upregulation of Reelin activity may ameliorate the symptoms of neuropsychiatric diseases. However, the regulatory mechanism underlying the functions of Reelin is largely unknown and there are no good animal models of Reelin malfunction; thus, causal relations between Reelin and neuropsychiatric diseases remain unclear. Recently, our studies have shown that proteolytic cleavage of the Reelin protein regulates its activity. Herein, we will review recent findings about relations between Reelin and Alzheimer’s disease, and the mechanism underlying the regulation of Reelin function by proteolytic cleavage.

In this open-label Phase II trial, the efficacy and safety of selexipag in Japanese patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is examined. Methods and Results: Selexipag was administered at 200 μg twice daily and titrated up to 1,600 μg by increments of 200 μg in 37 subjects to reach the individual maximum tolerated dose. At 16 weeks, in 33 patients comprising the per-protocol set, the pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR; primary endpoint) decreased from 683.2±237.3 to 560.3±238.7 dyn · s/cm5 (P&lt;0.0001). For the secondary endpoint, the 6-min walk distance (6MWD) increased from 445.0±102.2 to 459.1±112.8 m (P=0.0324); World Health Organization functional class improved in 4 patients (12.1%), and was maintained in 29 patients (87.9%). A decrease in PVR was also shown in patients treated with selexipag, on top of a phosphodiesterase inhibitor and endothelin receptor antagonist. Most of the commonly reported adverse events were consistent with those reported for other PGI2 formulations. Thirty-four patients attained the individual maximum tolerated dose (maintenance dose). Conclusions: The efficacy and tolerability of selexipag in Japanese PAH patients was confirmed by improvement in pulmonary hemodynamics, exercise capacity, symptoms. Selexipag is an efficacious treatment option for Japanese PAH patients. (Trial registration: JAPIC Clinical Trials Information [JapicCTI-111532].) ? 2017 Circulation Journal.

Japanese guideline (JSH2014) suggests using combination therapy to reduce the risk of comorbidities rather than high-dose monotherapy for the patients with cardiovascular disease and KD. Therefore, the present study assessed antihypertensive prescription patterns in Japanese patients with ischemic heart disease related diseases (IHDRD) and KD, and evaluated whether the prescription patterns match with the guideline-suggested therapies by analyzing the national insurance claims database (NDB). We extracted antihypertensive prescription patterns among Japanese IHDRD patients from the data of October 2011 of NDB, and examined the effect of KD on the prescription patterns. The number of prescribed antihypertensive was associated with KD among patients regardless of IHDRD. Patients with IHDRD and KD were more frequently prescribed combination therapy (calcium channel blockers/angiotensin II receptor blockers) than the calcium channel blocker monotherapy, based on the JSH2014. On the other hand, we did not observe the standard use of diuretics for patients with heart failure, which is suggested by the JSH2014. These findings suggested that patients with IHDRD and KD were frequently prescribed combination therapy to achieve its cardioprotective and renoprotective effects, according to the JSH2014, but the prescription profile to the patients with heart failure didn't match that of guideline-suggested therapies. This study provided a clinically important information and demonstrated the utility of NDB for compliance assessment for therapeutics guideline. ? 2017 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Antihypertensive prescription; Claims database; Guidelines; Ischemic heart disease related diseases; Kidney disease,"angiotensin 2 receptor antagonist; antihypertensive agent; calcium channel blocking agent; diuretic agent; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antihypertensive agent; calcium channel blocking agent; adult; angina pectoris; antihypertensive therapy; arteriosclerosis; Article; cardiovascular disease; comorbidity; comparative study; female; health care survey; heart failure; heart protection; hospital patient; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; Japan; kidney disease; major clinical study; male; middle aged; monotherapy; outpatient; practice guideline; prescription; protocol compliance; renal protection; Asian continental ancestry group; combination drug therapy; factual database; hypertension; insurance; Kidney Diseases; Myocardial Ischemia; practice guideline; protocol compliance; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Antihypertensive Agents; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Calcium Channel Blockers; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Drug Therapy, Combination; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Hypertension; Insurance Claim Review; Kidney Diseases; Myocardial Ischemia; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Prescriptions; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85021817398

In this paper, we assess the procedures of WFRs in two studies to describe their dietary assessment procedures and compare the subsequent outcomes. Methods: WFRs of 12 days (3 days for four seasons) were conducted as reference methods for intake data, in accordance with the study protocol, among a subsample of participants of two large cohort studies. We compared the WFR procedures descriptively. We also compared some dietary intake variables, such as the frequency of foods and dishes and contributing foods, to determine whether there were differences in the portion size distribution and intra- and inter-individual variation in nutrient intakes caused by the difference in procedures. Results: General procedures of the dietary records were conducted in accordance with the National Health and Nutrition Survey and were the same for both studies. Differences were seen in 1) selection of multiple days (non-consecutive days versus consecutive days); and 2) survey sheet recording method (individual versus family participation). However, the foods contributing to intake of energy and selected nutrients, the portion size distribution, and intra- and inter-individual variation in nutrient intakes were similar between the two studies. Conclusion: Our comparison of WFR procedures in two independent studies revealed several differences. Notwithstanding these procedural differences, however, the subsequent outcomes were similar. ? 2017 The Authors.",Dietary assessment method; Dietary records; Standardization,"case report; cohort analysis; controlled study; dietary intake; family; female; food frequency questionnaire; human; information processing; intermethod comparison; male; nutrient; nutritional assessment; portion size; public health; season; standardization; validation study; adult; aged; caloric intake; comparative study; diet; Japan; medical record; middle aged; procedures; reproducibility; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Diet Records; Diet Surveys; Energy Intake; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Validation Studies as Topic",2-s2.0-85021803654

Several studies have revealed the association between female hormone-asso-ciated factors and the prognosis of lung cancer, however the data remain inconsistent. The present study focused on the expression of estrogen receptor (ER)α in order to elucidate this association in smoking-independent lung cancer. Immunohis-tochemistry staining (IHC) of aromatase, ERα and ERβ was performed against formalin-treated tissues from 38 patients who had never-smoked who underwent complete surgical resection between 2012 and 2013. Among them, adequate RNA of the tumor and adjacent normal lung cancer was extracted from 31 matching deep frozen samples. Considering the IHC results, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to measure the expression level of 2 different exons of ERα, exon 6 and exon 7, which are part of the ligand binding domain of ERα, using the Taqman gene expression assay. Extra-nuclear expression of ERα using IHC demonstrated a statistically significant association with pathological invasiveness. RT-qPCR results exhibited a decreased expression of ERα exon 7 in invasive tumor tissues, compared with their adjacent normal tissues. This is consistent with the findings of previous in vitro studies indicating that extra-nuclear ERα were exon 7 splicing variants. No difference was observed in ERα exon 7 expres-sion between normal and tumor tissues in non-invasive lung cancer tissues. When considering the EGFR mutation status, EGFR wild-type lung cancers exhibited decreased ERα exon 7 expression levels compared with EGFR mutated lung cancers. Extra-nuclear expression of ERα, which may represent exon 7 splicing variants of ERα, showed statistical association with pathological invasiveness in smoking-independent lung cancer. The post-translational splicing mechanism of ERα may be involved in the acquired invasiveness of smoking independent lung cancer. ? 2017, Spandidos Publications.

A population-based approach aimed at decreasing high blood pressure among the general population is an important component of any comprehensive plan to prevent hypertension. However, few studies have investigated generational differences in knowledge about, and consciousness of, hypertension. Thus, we conducted a questionnaire survey about hypertension, with the aim of clarifying differences of understanding about hypertension between high school students and elderly people. The results of this investigation suggested that there is indeed a generational difference: knowledge about hypertension, and awareness of its relationship with salt intake, was higher in elderly people than in high school students. Furthermore, our study showed that among high school students, salt intake consciousness correlated with a family history of hypertension. By contrast, in elderly people, salt intake consciousness is related to age and to an awareness of recommended daily salt intake. This study strongly showed that knowledge and consciousness of hypertension varied among generations, with the elderly being more aware and conscientious about salt intake. Acknowledgement of this generational diversity is critical to developing an effective overall preventive strategy for hypertension. ? 2017 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Elderly people; Health consciousness; High school student; Hypertension; Population-based approach,"aged; Article; consciousness; high school student; human; hypertension; questionnaire; salt intake; administration and dosage; adolescent; adverse effects; awareness; Cardiovascular Diseases; epidemiology; female; health behavior; hypertension; knowledge; male; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; risk factor; Stroke; student; salt intake; Adolescent; Aged; Awareness; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Effect; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Hypertension; Knowledge; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Sodium Chloride, Dietary; Stroke; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85020103776

Methods: The intervention was based on the collaborative care model, and compromised four domains: identification of unmet needs, problem-solving therapy and behavioral activation supervised by a psychiatrist, psychoeducation and referral to relevant departments. Eligible women with breast cancer were provided the collaborative care intervention over four sessions. The feasibility of the program was evaluated by the percentage of women who entered the intervention and by the percentage of adherence to the program. Self-reported outcomes were measured by the Supportive Care Needs Survey-Short Form 34 (SCNS-SF34), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), the Concern about Recurrence Scale, and pre- and postintervention satisfaction with medical care. Results: In total, 40 patients participated in this study. The rate of participation in the intervention was 68%, and the rate of adherence was 93%. Participants had significantly improved scores on total perceived needs, physical needs and psychological needs on the SCNS-SF34; vigor and confusion on the POMS and function (physical, emotional and cognitive), nausea and vomiting, dyspnea, appetite loss and financial difficulties on the EORTC QLQ-C30 compared with the baseline assessment. Conclusions: Our findings indicated the intervention program was feasible. Further study is needed to demonstrate the program's effectiveness in reducing unmet needs. ? The Author 2016.

The recent sharp increase in the number of women diagnosed with mammary cancer per year is thought to be associated with increased fat intake resulting from changes in the dietary habits of contemporary Japanese citizens. In this study, human c-Haras proto-oncogene transgenic (Hras128) rats, which are highly susceptible to mammary carcinogens, were fed high- or low-fat diets to examine the relationship between fat consumption and the development of mammary cancer. Female 7-week-old Hras128 rats and wild-type littermates were administered benzo[a]pyrene. A week later, the animals were randomly assigned to high-fat or low-fat diet groups (45% or 10% of calories from fat, respectively). After 12 weeks, the rats were sacrificed and autopsied, and mammary tumors were excised and processed for microscopic observation. Mammary tumors were found in 11 of the 12 animals in the high-fat diet group and in 5 of the 12 animals in the low-fat diet group, and the numbers of mammary gland tumors per animal in these groups were 1.7 and 0.7, respectively. Notably, the observed differences in incidence and multiplicity of mammary tumors between the two groups were statistically significant. These results suggest a positive relationship between the incidence of breast cancer and high fat intake. ? 2017 The Japanese Society of Toxicologic Pathology.",c-Ha-ras gene; High-fat diet; Hras128; Mammary cancer,alanine aminotransferase; albumin; creatinine; fatty acid; high density lipoprotein; low density lipoprotein; phospholipid; triacylglycerol; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; breast cancer; breast carcinogenesis; cancer incidence; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; creatinine blood level; disease association; fatty acid blood level; female; incidence; lipid diet; low fat diet; nonhuman; oncogene H ras; phospholipid blood level; rat; triacylglycerol blood level; urea nitrogen blood level; weight gain,2-s2.0-85018779301

Hence, we conducted this study using urine samples to discover non-invasive biomarkers for the incurability of gastric cancer (GC). Urine samples from 111 GC patients were analyzed in this study. The GC cohort was categorized and analyzed according to disease stage and operability. In the discovery phase, protease protein array analysis identified 3 potential candidate proteins that were elevated in the urine of advanced GC patients compared to early GC patients. Among them, urinary kallikrein 10 (KLK10) was positively associated with tumor stage progression. Moreover, the urinary level of KLK10 (uKLK10) was significantly elevated in the urine of patients with inoperable GC compared to operable GC patients (median, 118 vs. 229; P=0.014). The combination of uKLK10, tumor location and tumor size distinguished operability of GC with an area under the curve of 0.859, 82.4% sensitivity and 86.2% specificity. Disease-free survival (DFS) was significantly shorter in GC patients with high uKLK10 compared to those with low uKLK10 (hazard ratio: 3.30 [95% confidence interval, 1.58-6.90] P<0.001). Immunohistochemical analyses also demonstrated a positive correlation between tumor stage and KLK10 expression in GC tissues (r=0.426, P<0.001). In addition, GC patients with high expression of pathological KLK10 (pKLK10) showed a significantly shorter DFS compared to those with low pKLK10 (hazard ratio: 3.79 [95% confidence interval, 1.27-11.24] P=0.010). uKLK10 is a promising non-invasive biomarker for the inoperability and incurability of GC.",Biomarker; Gastric cancer; Inoperability; Kallikrein 10; Urine,gelatinase B; kallikrein; kallikrein 10; myeloblastin; unclassified drug; adult; aged; Article; cancer staging; controlled study; disease specific survival; endoscopic surgery; female; gastrectomy; human; immunohistochemistry; major clinical study; male; protein expression; protein urine level; receiver operating characteristic; sensitivity and specificity; stomach cancer; tumor localization; tumor volume; urinalysis,2-s2.0-85018433719

The present study introduced the protocol of a birth cohort study to examine the beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA status in pregnant Japanese women as an adjunct study of the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). Methods: The JECS participants in the coastal areas of Miyagi Prefecture were further invited to participate in this adjunct study, and 1,878 pregnant women were enrolled prior to delivery. Their n-3 PUFA status was evaluated with fatty acid profiles in erythrocytes of maternal blood collected from 1,623 mothers at 24-30 weeks of gestation and cord blood from 1,505 deliveries. Results: The baseline results, including comprehensive data on the fatty acid status and determinants affecting the PUFA status, were analyzed. In stepwise multivariate analyses, the cord blood docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) level was found to be significantly influenced by the DHA level in maternal blood, the child's sex, and the gestational period. The maternal DHA level was influenced by fish intake, maternal age, and the prepregnancy body mass index. While cord blood eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) was influenced by maternal EPA, fish intake, and season at birth, additional factors such as maternal education, household income, and smoking habits affected the maternal EPA content. Conclusion: Further studies are warranted to clarify the nutritional impacts of n-3 PUFA in pregnant Japanese women of the cohort study. ?

We randomly assigned 134 patients diagnosed by Rome III criteria to 4 weeks treatment with RPZ 10 mg/day (n = 69) or ITO 150 mg/day (n = 65). Dyspeptic symptoms were evaluated using FD scores at baseline and after 1, 2 and 4 weeks of treatment. We also divided subjects into predominantly epigastric pain syndrome (EPS) or postprandial distress syndrome (PDS), and evaluated the efficacy of RPZ and ITO respectively. RPZ showed a significant decrease in the Rate of Change (RC) in FD score within 1 week, which was maintained until after 4 weeks, with RPZ a significant effect compared with ITO at all evaluation points. In addition, RPZ showed a significant decrease in FD score in subjects with both EPS and PDS, whereas a significant decrease in the RC with ITO was only shown in those with predominant PDS.

Therefore, this study aimed to confirm the perceptions and attitudes of medical doctors (MDs) in Dhaka, Bangladesh, with regard to Ayurvedic medicine (AM). A total number of 159 MDs in Dhaka were interviewed by face-to-face between February and June 2015. The study revealed that 62.0% of MDs had treated patients with AM and 55.3% believed that AM should be regarded as its own specialty, whereas 39.7% of MDs believed that AM should be part of the conventional medical curriculum and 32.7% thought that AM did not seem scientific. In terms of gender, 45.3% of male MDs agreed or strongly agreed that AM only had a placebo effect. On the other hand, 65.8% of female MDs disagreed or strongly disagreed it. In terms of age, 77.0% of MDs aged 36 or elder (elder MDs) believed they were more likely to recommend AM use and 80.3% of elder MDs believed that the government should encourage more initiatives to promote AM. To enhance AM use, scientifically robust information on the efficacy, safety and scientific basis of AM should be more effectively conveyed to male MDs.",Attitude; Ayurvedic medicine; Bangladesh; Medical doctor; Perception,"adult; attitude; Ayurveda; Bangladesh; female; human; male; perception; physician; psychology; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Attitude; Bangladesh; Female; Humans; Male; Medicine, Ayurvedic; Perception; Physicians",2-s2.0-85013271867

In an attempt to resolve this situation and gain information to optimize HSV-TK/GCV system for cancer therapy, we found that human equilibrative nucleobase transporter 1 (ENBT1) can transport GCV with a Michaelis constant of 2.75 mM in Madin-Darby canine kidney II (MDCKII) cells stably transfected with this transporter. In subsequent experiments using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged ENBT1 (GFP-ENBT1) and HSV-TK, the uptake of GCV (30 μM), which was minimal in MDCKII cells and unchanged by their transfection with HSV-TK alone, was increased extensively by their transfection with GFP-ENBT1, together with HSV-TK. Accordingly, cytotoxicity, which was assessed by the WST-8 cell viability assay after the treatment of those cells with GCV (30 mM) for 72 hours, was induced in those transfected with GFP-ENBT1, together with HSV-TK but not in those transfected with HSV-TK alone. These results suggest that ENBT1 could facilitate GCV uptake and thereby enhance cytotoxicity in HSV-TK/GCV system.Wealsoidentified Helacyton gartleri (HeLa) and HepG2 as cancer cell lines that are rich with ENBT1 and A549, HCT-15 and MCF-7 as those poor with ENBT1. Accordingly, the HSV-TK/GCV system was effective in inducing cytotoxicity in the former but not in the latter. Thus, ENBT1 was found to be a GCV transporter that could enhance the performance of HSV-TK/GCV suicide gene therapy.

The rapid virological response rates in patients receiving TVR-based triple therapy were 92% (23/25) and 40% (10/25) for CAP/CTM and ART, respectively. The false omission rate (FOR) of ART was 93.3% (14/15), indicating that CAP/CTM could accurately predict clinical outcome in the early phase. In an independent examination of 20 patients receiving TVR-based triple therapy who developed viral breakthrough or relapse, the times to HCV disappearance by ART were longer than by CAP/CTM, whereas the times to HCV reappearance were similar. In an independent experiment of WHO standard HCV RNA serially diluted in serum containing TVR, the analytical sensitivities of CAP/CTM and ART were similar. However, cell cultures transfected with HCV and grown in medium containing TVR demonstrated that ART detected HCV RNA for a longer time than CAP/CTM. Similar results were found for 42 patients receiving DCV/ASV dual therapy. The FOR of ART was 73.3% (11/15) at week 8 after initiation of therapy, indicating that ART at week 8 could not accurately predict the clinical outcome. In conclusion, although CAP/CTM and ART detected HCV RNA with comparable analytical sensitivity, CAP/CTM might be preferable for predicting the clinical outcomes of patients receiving protease inhibitor-based therapy. ? 2017 Inoue et al.

This may be the case in different countries in Eastern Asia. The aim of this study was to determine and understand the differences in diagnostic and therapeutic strategies of IBD between Japan and the rest of Asian countries (ROA). Methods: Questionnaires with regard to clinical practice in IBD were distributed to members of the International Gastroenterology Consensus Symposium Study Group. The responders were allowed to select multiple items for each question, as multiple modalities are frequently utilized in the diagnosis and the management of IBD. Dependency and independency of selected items for each question were evaluated by the Bayesian network analysis. Results: The selected diagnostic modalities were not very different between Japan and ROA, except for those related to small bowel investigations. Balloon-assisted enteroscopy and small bowel follow through are frequently used in Japan, while CT/MR enterography is popular in ROA. Therapeutic modalities for IBD depend on availability of such modalities in clinical practice. As far as modalities commonly available in both regions are concerned, there seemed to be similarity in the selection of each therapeutic modality. However, evaluation of dependency of separate therapeutic modalities by Bayesian network analysis disclosed some difference in therapeutic strategies between Japan and ROA.

Its treatment efficacy, especially in small airways, remains poorly understood. The study aim was to investigate LABA add-on effects of tulobuterol patch (TP) and salmeterol inhaler (SA) on pulmonary function, asthma control and health status. Patients who had adult-onset under-control asthma, despite taking inhaled corticosteroids, were enrolled in a randomized, open-label, parallel-group, proof-of-concept study of 12-week add-on treatment with TP (n=16) or SA (n=17). Spirometry, impulse oscillometry (IOS), exhaled nitric oxide levels, and clinical questionnaires of asthma control, health status (St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire: SGRQ), and symptoms were evaluated every 4?weeks. Add-on treatment of SA significantly improved the spirometric indices of small airway obstruction (forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% of FVC: FEF25-75, and maximum expiratory flow at 25% of FVC: MEF25) and IOS indices of whole respiratory resistance (resistance at 5?Hz) as compared to TP. In intra-group comparisons, add-on treatment of TP improved the scores of the asthma control test and the total SGRQ, as well as the symptom and impact components of the SGRQ. SA add-on treatment improved FEV1 and IOS parameters of resistance at 20?Hz and reactance at 5?Hz. Neither of the treatments improved exhaled nitric oxide levels. In conclusion, add-on treatment of TP improved asthma control and health status, whereas SA improved pulmonary function measures associated with large and small airway involvement among patients with adult-onset mild-to-moderate asthma. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",asthma; health status; long-acting β2-agonist; salmeterol inhaler; small airway; tulobuterol patch,"corticosteroid; nitric oxide; salmeterol; tulobuterol; bronchodilating agent; salmeterol xinafoate; terbutaline; tulobuterol; add on therapy; adult; Article; asthma; body mass; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; disease course; disease exacerbation; disease severity; drug effect; female; follow up; forced expiratory flow; forced expiratory volume; human; lung function; lung resistance; male; maximal expiratory flow; middle aged; randomized controlled trial; spirometry; St. George Respiratory Questionnaire; sustained drug release; treatment duration; aged; analogs and derivatives; asthma; combination drug therapy; nebulizer; pathophysiology; procedures; transdermal patch; Adult; Aged; Asthma; Bronchodilator Agents; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nebulizers and Vaporizers; Salmeterol Xinafoate; Spirometry; Terbutaline; Transdermal Patch",2-s2.0-85007242763

Acute knockdown of the α-subunit (Gαi2) with in utero electroporation caused delayed radial migration of excitatory neurons during corticogenesis, perhaps because of impaired morphology. The migration phenotype was rescued by an RNAi-resistant version of Gαi2. On the other hand, silencing of Gαi2 did not affect axon elongation, dendritic arbor formation or neurogenesis at ventricular zone in?vivo. When behavior analyses were conducted with acute Gαi2-knockdown mice, they showed defects in social interaction, novelty recognition and active avoidance learning as well as increased anxiety. Subsequently, using whole-exome sequencing analysis, we identified a de novo heterozygous missense mutation (c.680C>T; p.Ala227Val) in the GNAI2 gene encoding Gαi2 in an individual with periventricular nodular heterotopia and intellectual disability. Collectively, the phenotypes in the knockdown experiments suggest a role of Gαi2 in the brain development, and impairment of its function might cause defects in neuronal functions which lead to neurodevelopmental disorders.

The objective of this study is to measure sputum levels of prostanoids in asthmatic patients to correlate with clinical indices. Methods Mild (n?=?41) or moderate-to-severe (19) asthmatics and 27 normal controls were examined for pulmonary function (FEV1 and mid-forced expiratory flow), sputum cell differentials, and sputum levels of prostaglandins D2, E2, F2α, and thromboxane B2 measured by sandwich enzyme immunoassay. Results Each prostanoid level did not differ among the three groups. Sputum number of bronchial epithelial cells was greater in moderate-to-severe asthmatics than in the other two groups, suggesting epithelial desquamation. Levels of prostaglandin F2α, D2, and thromboxane B2 positively correlated with the severity of airflow obstruction in the 60 asthmatic patients, whereas prostaglandin E2 levels were unrelated to pulmonary function. The ratio of combined “contractile” prostanoids (prostaglandin D2/prostaglandin F2α/thromboxane B2) to prostaglandin E2 was 2.5-fold greater in moderate-to-severe asthmatics than in controls (p?=?0.001) or in mild asthmatics (p?=?0.0002) but did not differ between the latter two groups. In the two asthmatic groups combined, this ratio positively correlated with the sputum number of epithelial cells. The combined “contractile” prostanoids levels positively correlated with prostaglandin E2 levels in controls and in mild asthmatics but not in moderate-to-severe asthmatics. Conclusions An imbalance in production, breakdown, or both between prostaglandin E2 and other prostanoids possibly due to epithelial damage may be involved in the pathogenesis of moderate-to-severe asthma. ? 2016 Japanese Society of Allergology",Asthma; Epithelial damage; Induced sputum; Prostaglandin; Thromboxane,corticosteroid; prostaglandin D2; prostaglandin E2; prostaglandin F2 alpha; prostanoid; thromboxane B2; prostaglandin; adult; Article; asthma; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; cross-sectional study; disease severity; enzyme immunoassay; epithelium cell; female; forced expiratory flow; forced expiratory volume; human; human cell; major clinical study; male; priority journal; sputum level; asthma; clinical trial; metabolism; middle aged; severity of illness index; sputum; Adult; Asthma; Female; Forced Expiratory Flow Rates; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prostaglandins; Severity of Illness Index; Sputum,2-s2.0-85002553404

Approximately 30 cases have been reported to date, with a phenotypical variability ranging from asymptomatic to severe neurological illness. Non-neurological symptoms have been rarely reported. We describe a case of this disease with developmental delay and dysmorphic features. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry-based urine metabolomics demonstrated significant (?+4.5 standard deviation after logarithmic transformation) elevations of β-ureidopropionic acid and β-ureidoisobutyric acid, strongly suggesting a diagnosis of β-ureidopropionase deficiency. Subsequent quantitative analysis of pyrimidines by liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry supported this finding. Genetic testing of the UPB1 gene confirmed compound heterozygosity of a novel mutation (c.976C>T) and a previously-reported mutation (c.977G>A) that is common in East Asians. β-Ureidopropionase deficiency is probably underdiagnosed, considering a wide phenotypical variability, non-specific neurological presentations, and an estimated prevalence of 1/5000–6000.

Methods: Patients (aged 20–80 years) with history of calcium component stones who visited Nagoya City Hospital, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan, between April 2009 and June 2014 were included. They were retrospectively divided into those who did not receive potassium-sodium citrate (non-citrate group, n = 157) and those who did (citrate group, n = 60). For patients in both groups, we evaluated blood and urine biochemistry and sediment, number of computed tomography-detected microcalculi, number of asymptomatic microcalculi disappearances, and pain events.

Methods: 81 women (median: 56?years; range: 32–79) with a history of breast cancer were included in this study. They underwent whole-body bone scintigraphy after intravenous injection of 740?MBq technetium-99m hydroxymethylene diphosphonate. A total of 1066 bones (162 regions of the skull, 657 regions of the spine and pelvis, 223 regions of the sternum and rib, 18 regions of the upper extremities, and 6 regions of the lower extremities) were analyzed. The PI alone, VSBONE images alone, and both PI and VSBONE images (PI?+?VSBONE) were interpreted independently by two radiologists to diagnose bone metastases, which were then confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging. The sensitivity and specificity for each modality were analyzed using Fisher’s exact and McNemar tests. Inter-reviewer agreement was evaluated using a kappa statistic. Results: Bone metastases were confirmed in 43 patients with 442 positive lesions. The average sensitivity of PI, VSBONE images, and PI?+?VSBONE images was 40.8, 50.2, and 61.8?%, respectively.

Case report. Objective. To report on a pregnant woman successfully treated with microendoscopic discectomy in the left lateral position under general anesthesia at 24-week gestation. Summary of Background Data. Treatment for lumbar disc herniation in pregnant women poses a particular challenge due to the complexity of the clinical situation. Review of the literature emphasizes timely diagnosis with adequate management specific for each gestational period. A surgical approach mandates consideration of the physiologic parameters of pregnancy and the effects of these stressors on the fetus. Methods. A 38-year-old primigravid woman presented with persistent and incapacitating low back and left leg pain. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a herniated disc at L4-5 with a severely compressed left L5 nerve root. Symptoms were resistant to conservative treatment (acetaminophen; 1200 mg/day) and nerve root block with corticosteroids (1mg/0.5mL of betamethasone plus 0.5 mL of 1% lidocaine) provided only transient pain relief. Operative management with surgical discectomy was discussed. Anesthesiologists, obstetricians, and neonatologists were consulted for preoperative planning, focusing on appropriate anesthesia, ideal positioning for surgical access, and provision for emergent fetal care. Surgery was ultimately performed in the left lateral position, in contrast to the oft-used prone position. Microendoscopic discectomy was performed under general anesthesia at 24-week gestation. Results. The patient experienced complete relief from pain after surgical intervention and delivered a healthy baby at 39-week gestation after normal labor. Our methods, used in accordance with our preoperative simulation, resulted in a satisfactory outcome for both mother and child. Conclusion. Although previously published cases noted the safety of operating in the prone position under epidural anesthesia, we performed minimally invasive microendoscopic discectomy in the left lateral position in combination with general anesthesia and found that this is a safe and preferable alternative for pregnant patients in the latter stage of the second trimester. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The definition of the inactive HBV carrier state has been based on HBV DNA and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Here we conducted a prospective study involving 18 hospitals to clarify the prognosis of HBeAg-negative inactive carriers. Methods: Three hundred eighty-eight HBeAg-negative inactive carriers at the baseline were observed prospectively from January 2011 to November 2015. We evaluated the primary end point, defined as the development of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or liver-related death. Also, we analyzed the factors associated with inactive carrier dropout and markedly increased levels of ALT or HBV DNA or both during the follow-up period. Results: At the baseline, the mean age was 57.5?±?13.1?years and 42?% of patients were male. No individual developed cirrhosis, HCC, or liver-related death during the follow-up period (1035?±?252?days). Loss of inactive carrier status was seen in 75 patients (19.3?%). Factors associated with failure to meet the inactive carrier criteria in the multivariate analysis were the levels of ALT (hazard ratio 1.13, 95?% confidence interval 1.07–1.19, p?<?0.001), HBV DNA (hazard ratio 2.70, 95?% confidence interval 1.63–4.49, p?<?0.001), and γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (hazard ratio 1.01, 95?% confidence interval 1.00–1.02, p?=?0.003) at the baseline. Conclusions: Most inactive carriers in Japan had a good prognosis. However, despite the short observation period, some patients had loss of IC status. The long-term prognosis of inactive carriers remains unclear; therefore, careful follow-up of inactive carriers is needed. ? 2016, Japanese Society of Gastroenterology.",Chronic hepatitis; Hepatitis B virus; Inactive carrier; Prognosis,"alanine aminotransferase; gamma glutamyltransferase; hepatitis B surface antigen; hepatitis b virus DNA; unclassified drug; virus DNA; alanine aminotransferase; hepatitis B(e) antigen; virus DNA; adult; Article; controlled study; female; follow up; hepatitis B; heterozygote; hospital; human; Japan; liver cell carcinoma; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; prediction; priority journal; prognosis; prospective study; aged; blood; clinical trial; cohort analysis; hepatitis B; heterozygote; multicenter study; prognosis; virology; Adult; Aged; Alanine Transaminase; Carrier State; Cohort Studies; DNA, Viral; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Hepatitis B; Hepatitis B e Antigens; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Prospective Studies",2-s2.0-84974822819

Methods and results: We analysed 2511 cases of salivary gland tumour, clinicopathologically and immunohistochemically. The incidence of SDCRF was 0.4%. Eight patients were male. The age of patients ranged from 36 years to 85 years (mean, 61 years). SDC arose from the parotid glands and submandibular gland in six and three cases, respectively. Seven cases appeared as a carcinoma component of carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma cases. Six patients died of disease. Histologically, diffuse proliferations of non-coherent large ovoid or polygonal carcinoma cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei were observed in all cases; such cytological characteristics were defined as ‘rhabdoid features’. Immunohistochemically, all cases were positive for cytokeratin, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15, androgen receptor, and SMARCB1, seven cases were positive for HER2, and two cases were positive for epidermal growth factor receptor. However, all cases were negative for vimentin and myoepithelial markers. Eight cases showed no or aberrant expression of E-cadherin and β-catenin. The results suggest that SDCRF is an extremely rare subtype of SDC, and not a sarcomatoid variant of SDC. SDCRF is histologically unique, and is positive for SDC markers but negative for vimentin, unlike rhabdoid-type carcinomas arising from other organs. Conclusions: The morphogenesis of SDCRF is related to no or aberrant expression of cell–cell adhesion molecules. Therefore, SDCRF could be a salivary counterpart to pleomorphic lobular breast carcinoma. ? 2016 The Authors.

This study was conducted to assess the non-inferiority of the 6-month depot formulation, TAP-144-SR (6M) 22.5?mg to the 3-month depot formulation, TAP-144-SR (3M) 11.25?mg in postoperative, premenopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Methods: This was a 96-week phase III, randomized, open-label, parallel-group comparative study. All patients concomitantly received oral tamoxifen (20?mg daily). The primary endpoint was the suppression rate of serum estradiol (E2) to the menopausal level (?30?pg/mL) from Week 4 through Week 48. Results: In total, 167 patients were randomized to receive TAP-144-SR (6M) (n?=?83) or TAP-144-SR (3M) (n?=?84) and the E2 suppression rate was 97.6 and 96.4?%, respectively. The estimated between-group difference was 1.2?% (95?% confidence interval ?5.2 to 7.8). The non-inferiority of TAP-144-SR (6M) to TAP-144-SR (3M) for E2 suppression was confirmed. As for safety, common adverse events were hot flush and injection site reactions including induration, pain, and erythema in both treatment groups, which were of ?Grade 2 in severity and not serious. No significant between-group differences in safety profiles and tolerability were observed. Conclusions: TAP-144-SR (6M) was not inferior to TAP-144-SR (3M) for its suppressive effect on serum E2. TAP-144-SR (6M) was also as well tolerated as TAP-144-SR (3M). ? 2016, The Author(s).",Adjuvant endocrine therapy; Leuprorelin acetate 6-month depot; Luteinizing hormone–releasing hormone agonist; Ovarian function suppression; Premenopausal hormone receptor-positive breast cancer,estradiol; leuprorelin; tamoxifen; antineoplastic agent; estradiol; leuprorelin; tamoxifen; adult; anus fistula; area under the curve; arthralgia; Article; backache; cancer combination chemotherapy; confidence interval; constipation; controlled study; disease free survival; disease severity; dizziness; drug blood level; drug dosage form comparison; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug tolerability; drug withdrawal; eczema; estradiol blood level; estrogen receptor positive breast cancer; female; headache; hot flush; human; hyperhidrosis; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; injection site erythema; injection site induration; injection site pain; injection site reaction; injection site swelling; insomnia; interstitial lung disease; major clinical study; malaise; maximum plasma concentration; musculoskeletal stiffness; nausea; neutropenia; phase 3 clinical trial; postoperative period; premenopause; priority journal; progesterone receptor positive breast cancer; radiation injury; randomized controlled trial; rash; rhinopharyngitis; side effect; skin injury; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; Breast Neoplasms; clinical trial; drug effects; menstruation; middle aged; mortality; premenopause; treatment outcome; Adult; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Breast Neoplasms; Disease-Free Survival; Estradiol; Female; Humans; Leuprolide; Menstruation; Middle Aged; Premenopause; Tamoxifen; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84961671417

Patients and methods: A retrospective, case-controlled study involving 66 eyes of 46 Japanese wet AMD patients and 32 eyes of 20 control patients was performed. Wide-field FAF images were obtained for typical AMD (37 eyes/28 patients), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) (22 eyes/20 patients), and retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP) (seven eyes/four patients). Two masked ophthalmologists independently graded the images for mottled, granular, and nummular patterns. Main outcome measures were abnormal peripheral FAF frequencies and relative risks by disease subgroups and treatments. Results: Abnormal peripheral FAF patterns were found in 51.5% of wet AMD eyes compared with 18.8% of control eyes (P<0.001). Mottled, granular, and nummular patterns were found in 45.5%, 31.8%, and 16.7%, respectively, of wet AMD eyes. Each disease subgroup (typical AMD, 54.1%; PCV, 36.4%; and RAP, 85.7%) showed significantly higher frequencies of peripheral FAF (P<0.001, P=0.03, and P<0.001, respectively) than control eyes (18.8%). There were no significant differences (P=0.76) between the frequencies in untreated and treated eyes. Conclusion: Eyes of Japanese wet AMD patients had a higher abnormal FAF prevalence compared with control eyes. Among the three disease subtypes, abnormal patterns were least prevalent in PCV eyes. ? 2016 Suetsugu et al.",Age-related macular degeneration; Fundus autofluorescence; Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; Retinal angiomatous proliferation,age distribution; age related macular degeneration; aged; Article; autofluorescence imaging; clinical article; clinical evaluation; controlled study; fundus autofluorescence imaging; human; Japanese (people); outcome assessment; polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy; retina disease; retinal angiomatous proliferation; retrospective study; risk assessment,2-s2.0-85010871736

This cross-sectional study enrolled 4023 subjects aged 35–69?years (1847 men and 2176 women) selected from participants in the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study. This study was based on a self-administered questionnaire. No significant correlations between SIRT1 polymorphisms and BMI or long-term weight change were found in either the CR or the active groups. In the no-CR group, women with the rs1467568 G allele had a higher BMI than women without (p?=?0.02). Moreover, women with the rs7895833 A or rs1467568 G allele gained more weight from the age of 20?years than women without these alleles (p?=?0.03 for rs7895833 and p?=?0.003 for rs1467568). In addition, the odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) of these alleles for overweight (BMI &gt;?27.5?kg/m2) were significantly high in the no-CR women group (1.78 (1.06–2.99) for rs7895833 and 1.88 (1.13–3.15) for rs1467568) but not in the CR group. The results of this study suggest that CR might override the genetic contributions of the SIRT1 rs7895833 A and rs1467568 G alleles to BMI and long-term weight change. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",Cross-sectional study; Gene-environment interaction; Overweight; SIRT1,"sirtuin 1; SIRT1 protein, human; sirtuin 1; adult; aged; allele; Article; body mass; caloric restriction; controlled study; cross-sectional study; exercise; female; gene; genetic polymorphism; human; major clinical study; male; obesity; priority journal; questionnaire; self report; SIRT1 gene; weight change; allele; clinical trial; genetics; Overweight; pathology; time factor; Adult; Alleles; Body Mass Index; Caloric Restriction; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Overweight; Polymorphism, Genetic; Self Report; Sirtuin 1; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85018840588

Because cellular immortalization is one of the prerequisite steps in tumorigenesis, we tested whether cell growth analysis can be employed to check for immortalized (and potentially tumorigenic) cellular impurities in hCTPs. We monitored the growth of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) mixed with HeLa cells at a ratio of 1/106 or more and compared their growth rates with that of BMSCs alone. The cell growth analysis detected a significant increase in the growth rate of the BMSCs spiked with 0.0001% HeLa within 30 days at a probability of 47%. When human adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) were spiked with ASC52telo cells, a human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT)-immortalized adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell line, at a ratio of 0.001% or more, their growth rates were significantly increased within 15 passages, compared with that of ADSCs alone.

However, clinical use of the VSS-sf has not been reported in Japan, and there are very few analyses using scores of the factors or each item of the VSS-sf. The aims of this study is to report both clinical use of the VSS-sf in Japan and analyses using scores of the factors or each item of the VSS-sf. Methods: Participants included both adult inpatients and outpatients with either noncentral dizziness/vertigo or vertebrobasilar insufficiency which occurred more than one month before, diagnosed by expert neuro-otologists. Participants completed three questionnaires: the VSS-sf, the dizziness handicap inventory, and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS). We conducted a multiple regression analysis with the scores of the three factors of the VSS-sf, to evaluate how much influence there was from vestibular and autonomic symptoms on any handicap due to dizziness. We analyzed the scores of each item of the VSS-sf to examine profiles of the symptoms in major vestibular diseases. Results: The results of 159 participants were analyzed. Standard partial regression coefficients of anxiety, depression, and the vestibular-balance symptom with long duration were significant, however, those of the vestibular-balance symptom with short duration and the autonomic symptom were not. Most frequent autonomic symptoms were headache, chill/flashes, and palpitation in M?ni?re's disease, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, vestibular neuronitis, and psychogenic dizziness. Conclusion: The VSS-sf can be conducted without major problems in Japan, and may be useful for patients with vestibular diseases, not only to measure therapeutic effect but also to analyze the influence of, or relation between the vestibular-balance symptom/autonomic symptoms and other clinical variables.",Dizziness; Health-related quality of life; Patient-reported outcome; Vertigo,adult; anxiety disorder; Article; benign paroxysmal positional vertigo; chill; depression; disability; disease duration; dizziness; dizziness handicap inventory; headache; heart palpitation; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; hospital patient; hot flush; human; Japan; major clinical study; Meniere disease; noncentral dizziness; outpatient; psychogenic dizziness; symptom; symptom assessment; vertebrobasilar insufficiency; Vertigo Symptom Scale short form; vestibular neuronitis; vestibular test,2-s2.0-85012927526

Moreover, a recent study showed the association between the higher intake of yogurt and lower prevalence of depressive symptoms during pregnancy. Psychological problems, such as anxiety and depression, during pregnancy are serious health concerns and may increase the risk of adverse outcomes in children. In this study, we explored the association between fermented food consumption and psychological distress in 10,129 pregnant Japanese women, using the fixed data of the Japan Environment and Children’s Study (JECS), an ongoing nation-wide birth cohort study. Food consumption was assessed with a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), and the Kessler 6-item psychological distress scale (K6) was administered to eligible women during their second or third trimester to eliminate overlap with the period of hyperemesis gravidarum. The mean median gestation in the subjects was 24.8 weeks. In total, 9,030 subjects completed the K6 questionnaire and FFQ. Importantly, the prevalence of the K6 score of ? 13 was 3.1% (280 subjects). This value was lower compared to precedent studies, which may reflect that cooperative and health conscious subject participated in the survey. The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicates that the intake of yogurt, lactic acid beverages, cheese, Japanese pickles, miso soup, or fermented soybeans was not significantly associated with a K6 score of ? 13. In conclusion, the present cohort study shows no association between fermented food consumption and psychological distress symptoms during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. ? 2016 Tohoku University Medical Press.",Fermented foods; Japan environment and children’s study; Pregnant women; Psychological distress; The second or third trimester of pregnancy,"lactic acid; yoghurt; adult; Article; cheese; cohort analysis; comparative study; disease association; distress syndrome; female; fermented product; food; food frequency questionnaire; food intake; gestational age; human; hyperemesis gravidarum; Japan; Japanese (people); Japanese pickle; Kessler 6 item psychological distress scale; miso soup; multicenter study (topic); neuropsychological test; population research; pregnant woman; prevalence; second trimester pregnancy; soybean; third trimester pregnancy; child; environment; epidemiology; feeding behavior; fermentation; geography; mental stress; multivariate analysis; pregnancy; psychology; questionnaire; regression analysis; Child; Cohort Studies; Environment; Feeding Behavior; Female; Fermentation; Geography; Humans; Japan; Multivariate Analysis; Pregnancy; Prevalence; Regression Analysis; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Yogurt",2-s2.0-85006814760

Methods: Patients with stable heart failure and reduced (< 40%) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were divided into those treated with (LD) or without LD (NLD). The LD group was separated into subgroups of high (> 6.5 pg/dl) and low (? 6.5 pg/dl) AVP levels. The clinical and biochemical characteristics of the two groups were compared and the prognostic value of AVP levels in heart failure evaluated. Results: Of the 63 patients enrolled into the study, 41 (65.1%) were in the LD group and 22 (34.9%) were in the NLD group. Despite no differences between groups in LVEF, creatinine clearance, or brain natriuretic peptide, the LD group had significantly higher AVP levels compared with the NLD group. A Cox proportional-hazards model showed that AVP was an independent predictor of adverse events. In addition, the elevation in AVP in the LD group was inversely correlated with an increase in free water clearance but not serum osmolality and was related to poor outcome. Conclusions: Elevated AVP levels in patients with heart failure who received LD therapy were associated with a poor prognosis.

The responses of 7292 women were analyzed. They expressed high satisfaction with the genetic counseling system of the NIPT Consortium (94%). The number of respondents who indicated that genetic counseling is necessary for NIPT increased over time. Furthermore, they highly valued genetic counseling provided by skilled clinicians, such as clinical geneticists or genetic counselors. The vast majority (90%) responded that there was sufficient opportunity to consider the test ahead of time. Meanwhile, women who received positive test results had a poor opinion and expressed a low-degree satisfaction. We confirmed that the pre-test genetic counseling that we conducted creates an opportunity for pregnant women to sufficiently consider prenatal testing, promotes its understanding and has possibilities to effectively facilitate informed decision making after adequate consideration.

Polo-like kinase 4 (PLK4) is one of the centrosomal proteins required for centriole duplication. We here describe a patient with microcephaly and chorioretinopathy that harbors compound heterozygous missense variants, c.[442A>G]; [2336G>A], in the PLK4 gene. One of these variants, c.442A>G (p.(M148V)), resides in the kinase domain, and the other, c.2336G>A (p.(C779Y)), in the polo-box domain. Aberrant spindle formation was observed in a LCL derived from this patient. Overexpression experiments of the variant PLK4 proteins demonstrated that the p.(C779Y) but not the p.(M148V) had lost centriole overduplication ability. The altered mobility pattern of both variant proteins on a western blot further suggested alterations in post-translation modification. Our data lend support to the hypothesis that impaired centriole duplication caused by PLK4 variants may be involved in the etiology of microcephaly disorder. ? 2016 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

Okabayashi and colleagues report that even in elderly patients with IgA nephropathy (IgAN), immunosuppressive treatment can reduce proteinuria, with no adverse events. Their findings remind us of recent finding from STOP-IgAN study; additional immunosuppressive therapy to intensive supportive care [specifically renin–angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (RASi)] did not improve the outcome. If STOP-IgAN makes doctors believe that immunosuppression is not necessary, many patients could lose opportunity to eliminate their kidney disease. Indeed, we have experienced patients with IgAN, who despite hematuria, could not undergo renal biopsy or immunosuppressive treatment at another facility because of low proteinuria, and exhibited advanced lesions in their renal biopsy at our institution. The discrepancy between Okabayashi’s and STOP-IgAN study was derived not only from differences in population age (?60 years vs. 18–70 years). STOP-IgAN excluded the crescentic IgAN, whereas Okabayashi et al. found active manifestations (hematuria, mesangial proliferation, and cellular/fibrocellular crescent). Therefore, immunosuppressive therapy is required even in elderly patients. In STOP-IgAN, RASi were used first, and then immunosuppressive agent was additionally used. RASi has important implications to reduce glomerular capillary pressure and to suppress the intrarenal RAS activity. However, immunosuppressant should be administered initially to cure hematuria. In fact, microscopic-hematuria was resolved in only 16 and 42?% of two-assigned groups in STOP-IgAN, respectively. Okabayashi et al. provided a timely message regarding the significance of immunosuppressive treatment of IgAN. ? 2016, Japanese Society of Nephrology.",Elderly; IgA nephropathy; Immunosuppression; Tonsillectomy,"angiotensin antagonist; immunosuppressive agent; aged; Article; drug efficacy; drug safety; hematuria; human; immunoglobulin A nephropathy; immunosuppressive treatment; kidney biopsy; mesangium cell; proteinuria; renin angiotensin aldosterone system; drug effects; Glomerulonephritis, IGA; pathology; physiology; tonsillectomy; Aged; Glomerulonephritis, IGA; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Renin-Angiotensin System; Tonsillectomy",2-s2.0-84979255965

To introduce a laparoscopic approach for PD (Lap-PD), a robust and objective assessment system to evaluate the quality of this approach is needed. We describe a phase 1 surgical trial of Lap-PD (Registration ID: UMIN000015328) as a triad of surgery, novel self-assessment system, and feedback discussion implementing the Idea, Development, Exploration, Assessment, Long-term study (IDEAL) guidelines. Methods: This was a surgical phase I trial (corresponding to IDEAL stage 1) approved by the Ethics Committee of our hospital. The resection sequence was divided into 10 parts that were assessed and classified into one of four grades of achievement. Evaluation of each part was then integrated, and the whole Lap-PD was categorized into three grades of achievement. We set discontinuance criteria based on historical surgical outcome of open PD. The previous case was discussed before each new case, and measures to overcome problems were implemented. Five patients underwent Lap-PD. Results: All Lap-PDs were completed laparoscopically and reconstructed via mini-laparotomy. One patient suffered recurrent ileus requiring re-laparotomy to resolve a severe adhesion. After 1?year, no patient suffered disease recurrence or complication. Based on the self-assessment system, four Lap-PDs were successful, whereas one was rated as feasible owing to bleeding requiring conversion of resection sequence. Conclusions: Our triad system for evaluating Lap-PD could be a useful tool for the safe introduction and maintenance of Lap-PD. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Laparoscopic surgery; Pancreatoduodenectomy; Self-assessment system; Superior mesenteric artery,adult; aged; anastomosis stenosis; Article; clinical article; controlled study; exploratory research; female; human; ileus; intestine obstruction; intraductal papillary mucinous tumor; laparoscopic pancreaticoduodenectomy; laparoscopic surgery; laparotomy; male; middle aged; operative blood loss; pancreaticoduodenectomy; peritoneum adhesion; priority journal; reoperation; surgical approach; treatment outcome; Vater papilla carcinoma; carcinoma; clinical trial; feedback system; laparoscopy; Pancreatic Neoplasms; phase 1 clinical trial; practice guideline; self evaluation; Aged; Carcinoma; Feedback; Female; Humans; Laparoscopy; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreaticoduodenectomy; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Self-Assessment; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84975246814

The present investigation focuses on the effects of NR-DE on livers in rats, especially concerning inflammation and lipid metabolism. Male F344 rats were exposed to fresh air or low (24 ± 7 ?g/m3), medium (39 ± 4 ?g/m3) and high (138 ± 20 ?g/m3) concentrations of NR-DE for 1, 2, or 3 months (5 hours/day, 5 days/week). Exposure to both medium and high concentrations of NR-DE for one month increased plasma asparate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase activities, while only high concentrations increased plasma interleukin-6 and hepatic nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB), suggesting that activation of hepatic inflammatory signaling took place. Although these exposures elevated peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α levels or its binding activity to the response element, neither activated PPARα-target genes such as β-oxidative enzymes nor inhibited NFκB elevation. Thus, NR-DE may contain some materials that inhibit PPARα activation in relation to lipid metabolism and inflammation. Taken together, NR-DE exposure at one month may cause inflammation; however, this finding may not be observed after a longer exposure period. ? 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The purpose of our study was to evaluate the utility of electrocardiography (ECG)-gated CT for assessing thymic epithelial tumors with regard to the motion artifacts produced and the preoperative diagnostic accuracy of the technique. Material/Methods: Forty thymic epithelial tumors (36 thymomas and 4 thymic carcinomas) were examined with ECGgated contrast-enhanced CT using a dual source scanner. The scan delay after the contrast media injection was 30 s for the non-ECG-gated CT and 100 s for the ECG-gated CT. Two radiologists blindly evaluated both the non-ECG-gated and ECG-gated CT images for motion artifacts and determined whether the tumors had invaded adjacent structures (mediastinal fat, superior vena cava, brachiocephalic veins, aorta, pulmonary artery, pericardium, or lungs) on each image. Motion artifacts were evaluated using a 3-grade scale. Surgical and pathological findings were used as a reference standard for tumor invasion. Results: Motion artifacts were significantly reduced for all structures by ECG gating (p=0.0089 for the lungs and p<0.0001 for the other structures). Non-ECG-gated CT and ECG-gated CT demonstrated 79% and 95% accuracy, respectively, during assessments of pericardial invasion (p=0.03). Conclusions: ECG-gated CT reduced the severity of motion artifacts and might be useful for preoperative assessment whether thymic epithelial tumors have invaded adjacent structures. ?

In the present study, we performed histochemical analysis of 36 freshly resected lung cancer tissues by using 60 mAbs against 27 TAAs. Comparison of the staining patterns of tumor cells, bronchial epithelial cells, and normal pulmonary alveolus cells and interalveolar septum allowed us to determine the type and location of cells that express target molecules, as well as the degree of expression. The patterns were classified into 7 categories. While multiple Abs were used against certain TAAs, the differences observed among them should be derived from differences in the binding activity and/or the epitope. Thus, such data indicate the versatility of respective clones as anti-cancer drugs. Although the information obtained was limited to the lung and bronchial tube, bronchial epithelial cells represent normal growing cells, and therefore, the data are informative. The results indicate that 9 of the 27 TAAs are suitable targets for therapeutic Abs. These 9 Ags include EGFR, HER2, TfR, and integrin α6β4. Based on our findings, a pharmaceutical company has started to develop anti-cancer drugs by using Abs to TfR and integrin α6β4. HGFR, PTP-LAR, CD147, CDCP1, and integrin αvβ3 are also appropriate targets for therapeutic purposes. ? 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Cancer-associated antigens; Combination therapy; Histochemical analysis; Phage-display antibody library; Therapeutic antibody,"5' nucleotidase; activated leukocyte cell adhesion molecule; alpha6beta4 integrin; carcinoembryonic antigen related cell adhesion molecule 6; CD146 antigen; CD147 antigen; CD9 antigen; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; Hermes antigen; integrin; junctional adhesion molecule A; membrane cofactor protein; prostaglandin receptor; protein tyrosine kinase; protein tyrosine phosphatase; scatter factor receptor; tumor antigen; very late activation antigen 2; very late activation antigen 3; vitronectin receptor; alpha6beta4 integrin; antineoplastic agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epitope; ERBB2 protein, human; monoclonal antibody; peptide library; transferrin receptor; tumor antigen; antigen expression; Article; binding affinity; bronchus mucosa; controlled study; histochemistry; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lung alveolus cell; lung alveolus wall; lung cancer; tumor cell; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; bronchus; chemistry; classification; drug effects; epithelium cell; gene expression; genetics; immunology; Lung Neoplasms; metabolism; molecularly targeted therapy; pathology; peptide library; procedures; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Antigens, Neoplasm; Antineoplastic Agents; Bronchi; Epithelial Cells; Epitopes; Gene Expression; Humans; Integrin alpha6beta4; Lung Neoplasms; Molecular Targeted Therapy; Peptide Library; Receptor, Epidermal Growth Factor; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Transferrin",2-s2.0-84994750603

Forty-three consecutive patients who underwent laparos-copy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy preserving a minimal remnant stomach were examined. In addition to the conventional laparoscopy-assisted distal gastrectomy, some short and posterior gastric arteries were resected. A minimal remnant stomach-jejunum anastomosis was made by using a circular stapler with regular anvil or transoral anvil. Transoral anvil was selected in 19 patients, and regular anvil was used in 24 patients. The median operation time was 288 minutes, and the median blood loss was 50 mL. Conversion to open surgery was required in 2 patients due to bleeding. No patient required conversion to open surgery due to the difficulty of the anastomosis. Nine patients developed postoperative complications, including grade 3 duodenal stump leakage in 1 patient and grade 2 anastomotic bleeding in another patient. No mortality was observed. Laparoscopy-assisted subtotal gastrectomy preserving a minimal remnant stomach is safe and feasible for early gastric cancer invading the upper stomach. ? 2017 Wakasugi et al.",Laparoscopy; Roux-en-Y anastomosis; Subtotal gastrectomy,,2-s2.0-85037092952

N-butyl-N-(4-hydroxybutyl)nitrosamine (BBN) induces superficial bladder cancers with papillary morphology in rats and invasive bladder cancers with infiltrating phenotype in mice. In this study, we analyzed genomic landscapes of rodent BBN-induced bladder cancers using array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). While no significant copy number alterations were detected in superficial bladder tumors in rats, copy number gains in chromosomal regions 2D-E1, 7qA3, 9F2, and 11C-D were detected in invasive bladder tumors in mice. Amplification of representative genes located on 2D-E1 and 7qA3 chromosomal regions was confirmed by quantitative PCR. Cyp2a22 and Cyp2a5 genes but not Cyp2g1, Cyp2a12, and Rab4b genes on mouse chromosome 7qA3 were amplified in invasive bladder cancers. Although the human ortholog gene of Cyp2a22 has not been confirmed, the mouse Cyp2a5 gene is the ortholog of the human CYP2A6 gene located in chromosomal region 19q13.2, and CYP2A6 was identified by database search as one of the closest human homolog to mouse Cyp2a22. Considering a possibility that this region may be related to mouse 7qA3, we analyzed CYP2A6 copy number and expression in human bladder cancer using cell lines and resected tumor specimens. Although only one of eight cell lines showed more than one copy increase of the CYP2A6 gene, CYP2A6 amplification was detected in six out of 18 primary bladder tumors where it was associated with the invasive phenotype. Immunohistochemical analyses of 118 primary bladder tumors revealed that CYP2A6 protein expression was also higher in invasive tumors, especially in those of the scattered type. Together, these findings indicate that the amplification and overexpression of the CYP2A6 gene are characteristic of human bladder cancers with increased malignancy and that CYP2A6 can be a candidate prognostic biomarker in this type of cancer. ? 2016 Kanemoto et al.

However, it is difficult to differentiate tumor B cells from reactive B cells at the cellular level. We examined five cases of API2-MALT1 fusion-positive MALT lymphoma of the lung. A single paraffin section for each case was subjected to sequential retrieval of whole-slide imaging (WSI) data of hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining, immunofluorescence staining for CD79a, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) for the MALT1 split. We counted the number of MALT1 split-positive or MALT1 split-negative cells among CD79a-positive cells. The MALT1 split was detected in 59, 46, and 76?% of small, large, and intraepithelial B cells, respectively. A review of the HE-WSI data showed that cytomorphological distinction between the MALT1 split-positive and MALT1 split-negative B cells was virtually impossible. None of CD79a-negative lymphoid cells, epithelial cells, and microvascular endothelial cells was positive for MALT1 splits. As API2-MALT1 fusion is an early and critical event in the lymphomatogenesis, our findings are best interpreted as that a considerable number of B cells, either small, large, or intraepithelial, are reactive cells and that it is difficult to distinguish cytomorphologically between tumor B cells and reactive B cells. These findings suggest that the tumor architecture may be the central factor for making a correct histopathological diagnosis of MALT lymphoma. The sequential WSI of HE staining, immunofluorescence staining, and FISH as described here is a useful tool for pathological analysis at the cellular level. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",API2-MALT1 fusion; Fluorescence in situ hybridization; Immunofluorescence; MALT lymphoma; Microenvironment; Whole-slide imaging,"API2 MALT1 fusion protein; CD79a antigen; eosin; hematoxylin; hybrid protein; paraffin; unclassified drug; CD79 antigen; CD79A protein, human; oncoprotein; Article; B lymphocyte; capillary endothelial cell; cell structure; epithelium cell; fluorescence in situ hybridization; human; human cell; human tissue; immunofluorescence test; immunohistochemistry; lung cancer; marginal zone lymphoma; priority journal; single cell analysis; B lymphocyte; gene translocation; genetics; Lung Neoplasms; Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone; metabolism; pathology; procedures; Antigens, CD79; B-Lymphocytes; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Lung Neoplasms; Lymphoma, B-Cell, Marginal Zone; Oncogene Proteins, Fusion; Translocation, Genetic",2-s2.0-84986271682

The median age was 54?years (range 31–77). (1) From the baseline to 3-month, distress (DIT-D) ?4 with Impact (DIT-I) ?2 exhibited sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) of 0.776 [95?% confidential interval (CI) 0.688, 0.850], 0.889 (95?% CI 0.824, 0.954), 0.868 (95?% CI 0.792, 0.949), and 0.808 (95?% CI 0.731, 0.886), respectively.

HF and LF band powers quantified by power spectral analysis have most commonly been used in the conventional studies; the physiological significance of these measures has also been extensively studied. However, nonlinear characteristics of HF and LF components have not been well established. In this paper, we investigated nonlinear properties of HF and LF components in 122 healthy subjects and 108 patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). By analyzing bandpass-filtered time series of HRV corresponding to HF and LF components, it is shown that amplitude variability of HF and LF components displays long-range correlation, which cannot be explained by linear HRV properties. Compared with the age-matched healthy control group, the CHF patients showed significantly decreased long range correlation of HF component amplitude variability. These findings suggest that nonlinear properties of HF and LF components provides some complementary information on HRV dynamics. ? 2016 IEEE.",,autonomic nervous system; electrocardiography; heart failure; heart rate; human; pathophysiology; physiology; reference value; Autonomic Nervous System; Electrocardiography; Heart Failure; Heart Rate; Humans; Reference Values,2-s2.0-85009115772

Safety of the former focusing on the decline in hemoglobin levels was compared with that of the latter and assessed in terms of age and inosine triphosphatase (ITPA). Methods: Patients (n = 17) receiving sofosbuvir plus RBV and those (n = 24) receiving peg-IFN plus RBV diagnosed with chronic HCV genotype 2 were enrolled in this study, and the efficacy and safety of both treatments were assessed. Results: Rapid virological response was attained with sofosbuvir plus RBV treatment compared with peg-IFN plus RBV treatment. All patients under sofosbuvir plus RBV treatment achieved end-of-treatment response compared with 70% who sustained viral response under the peg-IFN plus RBV treatment, with the former demonstrating greater virological response. The decline in hemoglobin levels under the former treatment was greater than that under the latter and in patients over 65 years of age with ITPA gene major. Conclusion: Efficacy and safety of sofosbuvir plus RBV treatment were clearly demonstrated compared with those of peg-IFN plus RBV treatment. The decline in hemoglobin levels was not related to the discontinuation of the former treatment, irrespective of age or the effect of the ITPA gene. ? 2016 S.

However, some studies have reported that the insertion of dental implants into irradiated bone results in a higher frequency of implant failure than the insertion of such implants in nonirradiated bone. Materials and Methods: This report describes the cases of 4 patients with oral cancer who underwent surgery and radiotherapy (total dose: 50-86 Gy) and then had dental implants inserted within the irradiated area. In each case, an ilium bone graft or a latissimus dorsi myocutaneous flap containing scapular bone was transferred to the dental implant site before the insertion of the implants. Results: Twenty-three implants were inserted. After loading, 2 implants were lost, and 21 remained stable. Conclusion: In patients who have undergone radiotherapy for oral cancer, transferring bone grafts harvested from nonirradiated tissue to the irradiated site before implant insertion might help to improve dental implant survival rates. ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We investigated the effectiveness of cardiac surgery in patients with trisomy 18. Patients and methods We performed a retrospective analysis of 20 consecutive patients with trisomy 18 and congenital cardiac anomalies who were evaluated between August, 2003 and July, 2013. All patients developed respiratory or cardiac failure due to excessive pulmonary blood flow. Patients were divided into two subgroups: one treated surgically (surgical group, n=10) and one treated without surgery (conservative group, n=10), primarily to compare the duration of survival between the groups. Results All the patients in the surgical group underwent cardiac surgery with pulmonary artery banding, including patent ductus arteriosus ligation in nine patients and coarctation repair in one. The duration of survival was significantly longer in the surgical group than in the conservative group (495.4±512.6 versus 93.1±76.2 days, respectively; p=0.03). A Cox proportional hazard model found cardiac surgery to be a significant predictor of survival time (risk ratio of 0.12, 95% confidence interval 0.016-0.63; p=0.01). Conclusions Cardiac surgery was effective in prolonging survival by managing high pulmonary blood flow; however, the indication for surgery should be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis, because the risk of sudden death remains even after surgery. Patients' families should be provided with sufficient information to make decisions that will optimise the quality of life for both patients and their families. ?

Methods: A retrospective multi-institutional review was conducted by the Central Japan Lung Cancer Surgery Study Group. We analyzed both Echelon? (EC) and EndoGIA? (EGIA) staplers in this study. The stapling cartridges were classified into 3 colors according to the height of the ? loops: green (2.0?mm), gold (1.8?mm), and blue (1.5?mm). Results: Stapling of the pulmonary parenchyma was performed 9016 times. The total number of complications related to stapling was 61 (0.68?%). These complications were mainly caused by stapler-tissue thickness mismatch (n?=?30, 49.2?%) and tissue fragility (n?=?27, 44.3?%).

The cross-sectional study comprised 1720 men and women (aged 35–69 years) enrolled in the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study. Genotyping was conducted using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based invader assay. We used 46 items from a validated short food frequency questionnaire and examined major dietary patterns by factor analysis. We identified four dietary patterns: healthy, Western, seafood and bread patterns. There was no significant association between any dietary pattern and serum triglyceride levels. After a separate genotype-based analysis, significant interactions between ADRβ3 Trp64Arg genotype and the bread pattern (p for interaction = 0.01) were associated with serum triglyceride levels; specifically, after adjusting for confounding factors, Arg allele carriers with the bread pattern had lower serum triglycerides (p for trend = 0.01). However, the Trp/Trp homozygous subjects with the bread pattern showed no association with serum triglycerides (p for trend = 0.55). Interactions between other dietary patterns and ADRβ polymorphisms were not significant for serum triglyceride levels.

Beta catenin/CTNNB1, which is an important component of the Wnt signaling pathway, binds to E-cadherin at the cell membrane, where the complex of these two proteins functions in the stabilization of cell adhesion. However, its role in the pathogenesis of esophageal cancer is still unknown. Methods: This study included 86 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgery between 1998 and 2007. The expression of the E-cadherin/CDH1 gene product (E-cadherin/CDH1) and that of the beta catenin/CTNNB1 protein in the cell membrane were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. We examined the correlations among CDH1 or CTNNB1 expression, clinicopathological factors, and the prognosis of patients with ESCC. Results: CDH1 and CTNNB1 were expressed in 52.3 % (45/86) and 36.0 % (31/86) of tumor samples, respectively. Both CDH1 and CTNNB1 were co-expressed in 22.1 % (19/86) of esophageal cancer tissues. CDH1 expression correlated with the p-stage (stages I-II vs stages III-IV, p=0.032), T factor (T1-2 vs T3-4, p=0.0088), and lymphatic invasion (p=0.019). However, CDH1 expression did not correlate with the N factor or the blood vessel invasion. CTNNB1 expression correlated with the T factor (T1-2 vs T3-4, p=0.0015), p-stage (stages I-II vs stages III-IV, p=0.030), and lymphatic invasion (p=0.007). The CDH1(+)/CTNNB1(+) phenotype was inversely correlated with the T factor, N factor, p-stage, lymphatic invasion, and blood vessel invasion. Furthermore, patients whose tumors were double-positive for CDH1 and CTNNB1 had a significantly higher survival rate than those whose tumors were negative for CDH1 or CTNNB1 (log-rank test, p=0.0192). The T factor and N factor had a strong negative correlation with double-positive tumors. These were both independent prognostic factors, as was the double-positive phenotype. A univariate analysis indicated that the T factor, the N factor, and CDH1 and CTNNB1 co-expression were significant variables that predicted survival (hazard ratio, 2.387; 95 % confidence interval, 1.115-5.102; p=0.025). Conclusions: Decreased expression of CDH1 or CTNNB1 in the cell membranes of cancer cells is associated with poor survival of patients with esophageal cancer. ? 2016 The Author(s).",CDH1-CTNNB1; Esophageal cancer; Immunohistochemistry; Prognosis,"beta catenin; uvomorulin; beta catenin; cadherin; CDH1 protein, human; CTNNB1 protein, human; tumor marker; Article; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cancer tissue; cell membrane; esophagus cancer; immunohistochemistry; lymph node metastasis; phenotype; protein expression; protein function; survival rate; treatment outcome; aged; cell adhesion; esophagus tumor; female; human; Kaplan Meier method; male; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; pathology; prognosis; retrospective study; squamous cell carcinoma; Wnt signaling pathway; Aged; beta Catenin; Biomarkers, Tumor; Cadherins; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Adhesion; Cell Membrane; Esophageal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Lymphatic Metastasis; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Wnt Signaling Pathway",2-s2.0-84985918648

Methods: We compared the sensitivities and specificities, the rates of indeterminate results, and the rates of positive results in patients with total and CD4-positive lymphocyte counts of both assays simultaneously performed on 68 rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving methotrexate, in whom 33 had evidence of past tuberculosis infection by chest computed tomography and the other had neither history of tuberculosis exposure nor abnormalities in chest computed tomography. Results: The sensitivities, specificities, and the rates of indeterminate results of QFT-GIT were 21.2%, 100%, and 4.4%, and those of T-SPOT.TB were 21.9%, 100%, and 1.5%, respectively. The overall agreement of both assays was good (κ = 0.68). In patients with past tuberculosis infection, there are significant positive linear trends in positive rates of both assays across ranges of larger numbers of total and CD4-positive lymphocyte counts. Conclusions: Both assays were equally useful with high specificities, but may falsely identify past tuberculosis infection owing to low sensitivities.

Clinical scenario (CS), which classifies the pathophysiology of AHF based on the initial systolic blood pressure (sBP), was proposed to provide the most appropriate therapy for AHF patients. In CS, elevated aortic stiffness, vascular failure, has been considered as a feature of patients categorized as CS1 (sBP > 140 mmHg at initial presentation). However, whether elevated aortic stiffness, vascular failure, is present in such patients has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we assessed aortic stiffness in AHF patients using the cardioankle vascular index (CAVI), which is considered to be independent of instantaneous blood pressure. Sixty-four consecutive AHF patients (mean age, 70.6 ± 12.8 years; 39 men) were classified with CS, based on their initial sBP: CS1: sBP > 140 mmHg (n = 29); CS2: sBP 100-140 mmHg (n = 22); and CS3: sBP < 100 mmHg (n = 13). There were significant group differences in CAVI (CS1 vs. CS2 vs. CS3: 9.7 ± 1.4 vs. 8.4 ± 1.7 vs. 8.3 ± 1.7, p = 0.006, analysis of variance). CAVI was significantly higher in CS1 than in CS2 (p = 0.02) and CS3 (p = 0.04). CAVI did not significantly correlate with sBP at the time of measurement of CAVI (r = 0.24 and p = 0.06). Aortic stiffness assessed using blood pressure-independent methodology apparently increased in CS1 AHF patients.

Here, we analyse the clinicopathological characteristics of the patients extracted from this database with late recurrence and compare them with those with early recurrence. METHODS Of 1538 patients in the database with cT1aN0M0 NSCLC, 92 (6%) had recurrence. In this study, early recurrence was defined as recurrence within 5 years and late recurrence as recurrence beyond 5 years after surgery. We compared the clinicopathological characteristics and post-recurrence survival (PRS) between patients with early and late recurrence. RESULTS Of the 92 patients with recurrence, 21 (23%) had late recurrence. Compared with the early recurrence group, there were significantly more adenocarcinomas and local recurrences in the late recurrence group (P = 0.04 for both). The 3- and 5-year PRS rates were 53 and 24%, respectively, and the median PRS period was 38 months. There were no significant differences in the PRS curves between patients with early and late recurrence (P = 0.12). Only 3 patients (0.2%) had recurrence more than 10 years after ILR. Of the 21 late-recurrence patients, 17 (81%) had tumours with a consolidation/tumour ratio (CTR) >0.25. CONCLUSIONS Late recurrence occurred in 21 (23%) of 92 patients with recurrence after ILR for cT1aN0M0 NSCLC. Late recurrence was more likely to involve adenocarcinoma and local recurrence. It is thus considered reasonable to follow patients with a CTR >0.25 for 10 years after ILR. ? 2016 The Author 2016.

We retrospectively analyzed 16 HCV-seropositive patients who received systemic chemotherapy for hematologic malignancies to evaluate the usefulness of WFA+-M2BP for predicting HCV-related complications. These were defined as the onset of significant liver damage (LD) with increased HCV RNA levels, leading to interrupted or discontinued chemotherapy or the occurrence of HCC after chemotherapy.

He complained of numbness and weakness in the distal extremities at 114?days after BMT. His symptoms rapidly deteriorated and he required mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure. His clinical course and the findings of a nerve conduction study fulfilled the criteria for diagnosis of Guillain–Barr? syndrome (GBS). Sural nerve biopsy revealed active demyelination and infiltration of macrophages and CD8+ T-cells. After three cycles of intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, his symptoms gradually improved, and he could eventually walk unassisted. Although GBS has been known to develop after allogeneic BMT, the pathogenesis remains unclear, and specific treatment regimens have not been well established.

However, in patients with asthma, the concurrent assessment of seasonal variation in rhinitis and asthma symptoms has not been comprehensively addressed. We prospectively evaluated seasonal changes in rhinitis and asthma symptoms over one year. Methods Fifty-six patients with asthma were enrolled. Asthma and rhinitis symptoms were assessed by using the State of the Impact of Allergic Rhinitis on Asthma Control (SACRA) questionnaire, developed and validated in Japan by the committee　of Global Initiative for Asthma and the committee of Allergic Rhinitis for asthma and its impact on Asthma. Results Fifty-three patients completed the study. Forty-five patients (85%) had nasal symptoms during at least one or more seasons and 15 patients (28%) had perennial rhinitis. The association between asthma symptoms and rhinitis symptoms, assessed by a visual analogue scale (VAS), was significant during each season; seasonal variations of symptoms were synchronous. Uncontrolled asthma was more prevalent in patients with moderate-to-severe rhinitis compared to those with mild rhinitis. The VAS score of asthma symptoms in patients with asthma and perennial rhinitis was significantly higher than that in patients with non-perennial rhinitis or without rhinitis, across every season, except for spring. Correlations were more significantn patients less than 65 years of age than in older patients. Conclusion Rhinitis is common in patients with asthma. Symptoms of rhinitis and asthma often co-exist, and the association between these symptoms may be stronger n younger patients with asthma than older. ? 2016 The Japanese Respiratory Society",Allergic rhinitis; Asthma; Questionnaire; Seasonal variation,"adult; aged; Article; asthma; disease control; disease severity; female; human; Japan; major clinical study; male; observational study; perennial rhinitis; prospective study; questionnaire; rhinitis; seasonal variation; self evaluation; State of the Impact of Allergic Rhinitis on Asthma Control questionnaire; symptom; very elderly; visual analog scale; asthma; complication; middle aged; pathophysiology; rhinitis; season; severity of illness index; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Asthma; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Rhinitis; Seasons; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84978483994

This study investigated the association between cigarette smoking and the risk of ATLL development among Japanese carriers of HTLV-1. Methods: This study examined the association between smoking and development of ATLL in a cohort of 1,332 Japanese HTLV-1 carriers aged 40–69?years free of ATLL at baseline from two different HTLV-1-endemic areas of Japan. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for sex, geographic area, age at baseline, and alcohol drinking were used to estimate the effect of cigarette smoking on ATLL development. Results: Between 1993 and 2012, 25 new ATLL cases were identified among these subjects. The overall crude incidence rate for ATLL was 1.08 per 1,000 person-years among HTLV-1 carriers and was higher among male carriers than among female carriers (2.21 vs. 0.74). The risk of ATLL development increased significantly with increasing numbers of cigarettes smoked per day (hazard ratio for every increment of 20 cigarettes, 2.03; 95?% confidence interval (CI) 1.13–3.66 overall, 2.07 (95?% CI 1.13–3.73) in male carriers).

Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated aortic root dilatation at the sinus of Valsalva, moderate aortic regurgitation, and decreased wall motion in the inferior part of the left ventricle. Non-ECG-gated enhanced computed tomography (CT) did not reveal an aortic dissection. The patient underwent emergent coronary angiography, which revealed a severely narrowed ostium of the right coronary artery (RCA). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) was performed under intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance. IVUS images demonstrated an intimal flap extending from the aortic wall to the proximal RCA, suggesting that a periaortic hematoma in the false lumen compressed the ostium of the RCA, leading to acute myocardial infarction. To recover hemodynamic stability, the RCA ostium was stented. Subsequent ECG-gated enhanced CT clearly depicted the entry point and extension of the dissection localized within the sinus of Valsalva. The dissection likely involved the left main coronary artery and an emergent Bentall procedure was performed. Intraoperative findings confirmed an intimal tear and extension of the dissection.

Precise simulations by adopting excellent models and appropriate algorithms have given us numerous novel information and understandings. Here, we showed a novel theoretical and quantitative algorithm for disease diagnosis. There are huge number of small RNA genes named microRNA (miRNA), a regulator of gene expression, in humans. It has recently been indicated that miRNAs have quantum character according to RNA wave 2000 model. Application of this quantum simulation to disease big data including miRNA expression level were executed by using cluster-computing. Algorithms based on this theory have revealed synergistic miRNA functions with quantum coherent and disease-implicated miRNA superposition spectrums have been discovered as miRNA memory. Our result revealed that disease may be able to express linear function between disease tissue and normal tissue by miRNA quantum superposition. In turn, only to calculation of miRNA quantum superposition could be needed to diagnose and cure disease.

Previous research has shown that severe nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy (NVP) and hyperemesis gravidarum, which is an extreme form of NVP, represent risk factors for small-for-gestational-age birth. However, there is no clear consensus on this association. Thus, in the present study, we investigated the correlation between hyperemesis gravidarum and NVP on the one hand, and infant birth weight on the other, using data from the Japan Environment and Children's Study (JECS). Methods: The data utilized in the present study were obtained from the JECS, an ongoing cohort study that began in January 2011. Our sample size was 8635 parent-child pairs. The presence or absence of severe NVP, hyperemesis gravidarum, and potential confounding factors were noted. A multivariable regression analysis was used to estimate risks for small-for-gestational-age birth, and the results were expressed as risk ratios and 95 % confidence intervals. Results: The risk ratios of small-for-gestational-age birth (95 % confidence interval) for mothers with severe NVP and those with hyperemesis gravidarum were 0.86 (0.62-1.19) and 0.81 (0.39-1.66), respectively, which represents a non-significant result.

Method: We investigated ADL at discharge in 44 patients with stroke (men, n = 27; women, n = 17; mean age 78 years [range 71–85 years]) aged ?65 years with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale scores of ?5 (cerebral infarction, n = 37; cerebral hemorrhage, n = 7). We used single correlation analysis and multiple regression analysis to investigate factors that correlated with ADL at discharge. ADL at discharge was also evaluated on the basis of white matter lesion severity (Fazekas classification, grades 0–3). Results: Single correlation analysis showed that age (r = ?0.36, P = 0.016), male sex (r = 0.362, P = 0.016), neurological symptom severity (r = ?0.361, P = 0.016), ADL on starting rehabilitation (r = 0.685, P < 0.001) and white matter lesion severity (r = ?0.361, P = 0.016) significantly correlated with ADL at discharge.

Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 20 healthy women in their second (n = 13) or third (n = 7) trimester of pregnancy. Incremental cardiopulmonary exercise testing was performed with an electromagnetic cycle ergometer. Heart rate variability was analyzed by frequency analysis software. Results: The low-frequency to high-frequency (LF/HF) ratio, an indicator of the sympathetic nervous system, was significantly higher in third trimester than in second trimester subjects (P < 0.05) at 1, 2, and 3 min of incremental exercise testing. In contrast, the HF/total power ratio, an indicator of rapidly acting parasympathetic activity, was significantly higher in second trimester than in third trimester subjects (P < 0.05) at 2 and 3 min. In addition, a negative correlation was found between gestational age and the ‘accumulation half-time’ of the LH/HF ratio, the time point at which the sum of the LF/HF ratio reached 50% of that accumulated in the total 6 min of exercise testing (r = ?0.49, P = 0.028). Conclusions: The autonomic response to exercise in pregnant women differs between the second and third trimesters. These differences should be considered when prescribing exercise to pregnant women. ? 2016 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology",autonomic neural activity; exercise; pregnant women; second trimester; third trimester,adrenergic system; adult; Article; autonomic neural activity; cardiopulmonary exercise test; cardiopulmonary hemodynamics; correlational study; cross-sectional study; diastolic blood pressure; electromagnetic cycle ergometry; ergometry; exercise; exercise intensity; expired air; female; gas analysis; gestational age; heart rate variability; high frequency to total power ratio; human; human experiment; low frequency to high frequency ratio; metabolic equivalent; nerve conduction; nervous system function; normal human; parasympathetic tone; resting heart rate; second trimester pregnancy; systolic blood pressure; third trimester pregnancy,2-s2.0-84978759452

Materials and methods: Ten healthy volunteers were told to breathe in FB, under AC and under AC?+?VF in random order. The standard deviation (SD) values of the respiratory cycle, the amplitude, the lowest points (exhalation), and the highest points (inhalation) of respiratory wave were used as indices of respiratory stability. Results: Compared with FB, the AC method significantly improved respiratory cycle stability (p?=?0.001). The AC?+?VF method improved the stability of the respiratory cycle, the amplitude and the lowest point of respiratory wave (all p?<?0.001). In analyses of each subject’s data, compared with FB, the AC method significantly improved the respiratory cycle stability in five subjects, and the AC?+?VF method improved the stability of the respiratory cycle, the amplitude and the lowest point of respiratory wave in 4, 5, and 4 subjects, respectively. In two cases, coaching did not improve respiratory stability. Conclusion: The AC?+?VF method had the most beneficial effects on respiratory stability. However, coaching is not necessarily effective in all cases.

A national online survey in a cross-sectional study was conducted by HIV Futures Japan project from July 2013 to February 2014. Of the 1095 HIV-positive individuals who responded, 913 responses were determined to be valid; responses from the 875 males were analysed. A total of 282 participants used addictive drugs (32.2%) in past year. New psychoactive substances were used by 121 participants (13.8%), methamphetamine or amphetamine by 47 (5.4%), air dusters/sprays/gas by 31 (3.5%), 5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine (5MeO-DIPT) by 16 (1.8%) and cannabis (1.0%) by 9. Multiple logistic regression analysis was performed with the use of alkyl nitrites, addictive drugs, air dusters and thinners, which are low illegality, as dependent variables. We found that the odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for use among participants with full-time and temp/contracted/part-time employees compared to management/administration professions were 2.59 (0.99–6.77) and 2.61 (0.91–7.51). Also, a correlation was observed between alkyl nitrites and new psychoactive substances and usage rates in people engaged in few HIV-positive networks. It is necessary to develop targeted policies for drug use prevention and user support among HIV-positive men and to support and provide care for drug users who are isolated or have a narrow HIV/AIDS support network. ? 2016 Taylor & Francis.",alkyl nitrites; amphetamine; Japan; non-intravenous drug users; people living with HIV/AIDS; Recreational drug use,"amphetamine; cannabis; methamphetamine; n,n diisopropyl 5 methoxytryptamine; nitrite; recreational drug; street drug; adult; Article; cross-sectional study; drug abuse; health survey; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Japan; male; priority journal; social aspect; social support; classification; comorbidity; drug use; HIV Infections; middle aged; needs assessment; psychology; social support; socioeconomics; statistics and numerical data; Substance-Related Disorders; Adult; Comorbidity; Cross-Sectional Studies; Drug Users; HIV Infections; Humans; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Social Support; Socioeconomic Factors; Street Drugs; Substance-Related Disorders",2-s2.0-84958763748

Methods: Study participants with pathologically proven ear cancer were treated with SRT (35 Gy for 3 fractions or 40 Gy for 5 fractions) as first-line therapy. When local tumor recurrence developed following SRT, subtotal temporal bone resection and postoperative chemoradiotherapy were performed as salvage treatment. Boluses were used for the initial 14 study patients. Results: Twenty-nine study participants were enrolled and staged with T1 (n = 3), T2 (n = 7), T3 (n = 14), or T4 disease (n = 5). Three-year overall survival rates were 69% for T1/2 disease, 79% for T3 disease, and 0% for T4 disease. Three-year local control rates were 70% for T1/2 disease, 50% for T3 disease, and 20% for T4 disease. Grade 2 or higher dermatitis or soft-tissue necrosis occurred more frequently in study patients treated with boluses (8/14 vs 2/15; P =. 02). Salvage treatment was safely performed for 12 recurrent cases. Conclusions: These results suggest that SRT outcomes are promising for patients with ear cancer (? T3 disease). The rate of toxicity was acceptable in the study patients treated without boluses. Outcomes of salvage surgery and postoperative radiotherapy following SRT were also encouraging. ? 2016, H.

We evaluated the effects of chemotherapy on the cell number and activity of NK cells from patients who received the vincristine–cyclophosphamide–doxorubicin–prednisone (VCAP), doxorubicin–ranimustine–prednisone?(AMP), and vindesine–etoposide–carboplatin–prednisone (VECP) (mLSG15) or mLSG15-like (-L) regimen, which is one of the standard of cares for newly diagnosed adult T-cell leukemia–lymphoma (ATL), or the cyclophosphamide–doxorubicin–vincristine–prednisone (CHOP) or CHOP-L regimen which is another standard of care for ATL and peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). Methods: The number of lymphocytes and NK cells, and NK cell activity, were assessed using flow cytometry and a 51Cr release assay, respectively. Results: A total of 26 patients with untreated ATL or PTCL were enrolled, and blood samples from 25 patients were evaluable. NK cell number in ATL decreased after mLSG15/-L treatment, and the degree of decrease in the NK cell number was more prominent just before VECP therapy (Day 15–17 of each cycle) than just before VCAP therapy (Day 1 of each cycle). The NK cell number in ATL after CHOP/-L treatment also decreased. Interestingly, the NK cell activity showed a tendency to increase after the treatment. NK cell number in PTCL did not decrease by CHOP/-L regimen, but the activity was slightly decreased after the treatment. Conclusions: These results indicate that the effects of chemotherapeutic agents on NK cells vary according to the disease type and intensity of chemotherapy. ? 2016, The Author(s).",Antibody; ATL; Chemotherapy; NK cell; PTCL,"albumin; carboplatin; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; etoposide; lactate dehydrogenase; nitrogen; prednisone; ranimustine; urea; vincristine; vindesine; antineoplastic agent; carboplatin; cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; etoposide; nitrosourea derivative; prednisone; ranimustine; vincristine; vindesine; adult; aged; albumin blood level; Article; blood sampling; cancer combination chemotherapy; clinical article; clinical evaluation; female; flow cytometry; human; lactate dehydrogenase blood level; lymphocyte count; male; natural killer cell; peripheral T cell lymphoma; priority journal; release assay; T cell leukemia; urea nitrogen blood level; case control study; clinical trial; drug effects; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; natural killer cell; pathology; Adult; Aged; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Carboplatin; Case-Control Studies; Cyclophosphamide; Doxorubicin; Etoposide; Female; Flow Cytometry; Humans; Killer Cells, Natural; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral; Male; Middle Aged; Nitrosourea Compounds; Prednisone; Vincristine; Vindesine",2-s2.0-84978284876

The patients were all men who have sex with men (MSM) and inhabited several metropolitan areas of Japan, suggesting that the recombinant strains may be circulating among high-risk groups such as MSM. Here, we investigated the genomic structure and virological properties of the HBV/G/A2 strains. Methods: Complete genome sequences of the isolates were determined and phylogenetically analyzed. Replication efficiency of HBV/G/A2 was investigated by transfecting plasmids containing 1.24-fold viral genome. The in vivo viral kinetics of HBV/G/A2 were investigated using chimeric mice with humanized livers. Results: Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the four strains were almost identical (>99.7% homologous). The preS2/S region of these strains was highly homologous to that of genotype A2 and the remaining region was almost identical to that of genotype G, reflecting inter-genotypic recombination. Interestingly, in all four cases, genotype A was co-infected as a minor population. In vitro analysis revealed that HBV/G/A2 had a low replication rate. Although detectable viremia was not measurable following the inoculation of HBV/G/A2 into chimeric mice, subsequent superinfection of HBV genotype A greatly enhanced HBV/G/A2 replication and viral spread. Conclusion: We found that four cases of HBV/G/A2 recombinant among MSM patients in the metropolitan areas of Japan, and HBV/A co-infections are required for its efficient replication. High-risk groups such as MSM should be carefully tested for infection of genotype G-derived variants. ? 2015 The Japan Society of Hepatology",chimeric mice; co-infection; genotype A; genotype G/A recombination; hepatitis B virus; men who have sex with men,hepatitis B(e) antigen; acute hepatitis B; adult; Article; case report; chronic hepatitis B; enzyme immunoassay; gene sequence; Hepatitis B virus; Hepatitis B virus genotype A; Hepatitis B virus genotype A2; Hepatitis B virus genotype G; human; in vitro study; inoculation; Japan; male; men who have sex with men; microbial kinetics; nonhuman; phylogeny; priority journal; viral kinetics; virus isolation; virus replication; virus strain,2-s2.0-84977650409

Methods: This nationwide, multicenter study evaluated patients who were younger than 18 years of age when diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and were treated with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) monotherapy or PEG-IFN/ribavirin (RBV) combination therapy between 2004 and 2013. The subjects' median age was 10 (3-18) years, with a male to female ratio of 52:50 and a genotype-1 to genotype-2 ratio of 45:57. Among the 102 patients, 18 received PEG-IFN monotherapy and 84 received PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy. The IL28B genotype polymorphism was analyzed in patients infected with genotype-1. Results: In patients with HCV genotype-1 infections, sustained virological response (SVR) rates obtained by PEG-IFN monotherapy and by PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy were 100% (2/2) and 72% (31/43), respectively. In patients with HCV genotype-2 infections, SVRs were 75% (12/16) and 100% (41/41), respectively. In 32 genotype-1 patients available for the IL28B genotype (rs8099917), SVR was achieved in more patients in the IL28B major allele group than in the minor allele group (15/17 vs 7/15, P=0.021) after PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy. The frequencies of adverse events were similar between the treatment regimens. Conclusions: Overall, both therapies showed encouraging results, and were reasonably safe in children and adolescents with chronic hepatitis C.

The relationship between dizziness and stress is well documented, but that between dizziness and insomnia is unclear. In this series, we focus on M?ni?re's disease, which is characterized by fluctuating and progressive hearing loss, aural fullness, tinnitus, and intermittent attacks of vertigo, an illusory sensation of movement resulting from dysfunction of the labyrinth and cochlea, to investigate the relation between sleep disorders and dizziness. In our previous report, we first found that the sleep quality of M?ni?re's disease patients was impaired. M?ni?re's patients have a longer total sleeping time, lack of deep sleep stages, increased arousal, and the combination with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and/or periodic limb movement disorder was occasionally noted. Poor quality of sleep may cause additional stress and lead M?ni?re's disease patients into a negative spiral of symptoms. Furthermore, poor sleep quality may result in M?ni?re's disease patients being refractory to medical management. Therefore, prospective treatment focusing on the sleep disorders of, not just M?ni?re's disease but possibly also dizziness symptoms, may become an additional new strategy for terminating the negative spiral of symptoms and reduce exacerbation of the affected patient's conditions.",CPAP; Dizziness; Insomnia; Meniere's disease; Sleep apnea,Article; cochlea; dizziness; human; inner ear; insomnia; Meniere disease; periodic limb movement disorder; quality of life; sleep arousal disorder; sleep disordered breathing; sleep quality,2-s2.0-84981200573

For this purpose, decreasing the rectal contents as much as possible is important. Daisaikoto (DST) and bukuryoingohangekobokuto (BIHKT) are traditional Japanese herbal (Kampo) formulas that have been used to treat patients with abdominal bloating or constipation. Materials and Methods: This study investigated the effect of DST and BIHKT on the rectal gas volume during prostate IMRT according to Kampo diagnosis. Five patients were treated with DST or BIHKT at a dose of 5.0 or 7.5 g/d. The volume of rectal gas in 189 megavoltage computed tomographic images taken before each treatment session and the frequency of rectal gas drainage were evaluated before and after DST or BIHKT administration. Results: After DST or BIHKT treatment, the mean volume of rectal gas was reduced from 6.4 to 2.1 mL, and the mean frequency of gas drainage decreased from 43% to 9%. Conclusions: DST and BIHKT appear to be useful in reducing rectal gas, which would help prevent radiation proctitis and improve the local control of prostate cancer with IMRT. ?

We therefore investigated interactions between inflammation-related gene polymorphisms and cigarette smoking on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the Japanese general population. Method: We conducted a cross-sectional study using data collected from 2619 Japanese (1274 males and 1345 females) 40-69 years of age who participated in baseline survey of the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study (2005-2008). Eight polymorphisms in seven genes (interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13 and tumor necrosis factor-α) were determined using the Invader assay. The interactions of smoking and gene polymorphisms on HbA1c levels were analyzed using multiple linear and logistic regression models and analysis of covariance with adjustment for potential confounders. Results: Among the eight polymorphisms, only one significant interaction was detected for IL-1β T-31C (P &lt; 0.0001). Among the subjects carrying TT genotype, current heavy smokers (?20 cigarettes/day) had higher HbA1c (5.83 [95% confidence interval 5.67-5.99] %) versus all other smoking status groups (never 5.49 [5.41-5.56] %, former 5.54 [5.43-5.65] %, current moderate [&lt;20 cigarettes/day] 5.50 [5.30-5.69] %), whereas such differences were not observed in the subjects with C allele. The logistic regression analyses regarding high-normal HbA1c levels showed a similar pattern of results. Conclusion: Smoking status did not interact with any other inflammation-related polymorphisms except for IL-1β T-31C. Heavy smokers harboring the TT genotype of IL-1β T-31C polymorphism show a greater adverse effect of smoking on HbA1c levels among Japanese middle-aged subjects. ? 2015 The Authors.",Cigarette smoking; Gene polymorphism; Gene-environmental interaction; Glycated hemoglobin; Inflammatory cytokine,glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c; interleukin 10; interleukin 13; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 8; tumor necrosis factor alpha; adult; aged; allele; analysis of covariance; Article; cohort analysis; confidence interval; confounding variable; controlled study; cross-sectional study; cytokine production; female; gene expression; genetic association; genotype; health survey; hemoglobin blood level; human; immunoassay; inflammation; Invader assay; Japan; Japanese (people); logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multicenter study; multiple linear regression analysis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; predictive value; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking,2-s2.0-84962016423

Recently, a genome-wide association study identified two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) near?or in the CTSO and ZNF423 genes that were associated with breast cancer risk during tamoxifen therapy. We hypothesized that these two SNPs could be associated with increased recurrence in breast cancer patients who received adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. Methods: A total of 586 breast carcinomas were available for SNP genotyping assays. TaqMan pre-designed SNP genotyping assays were used to identify the presence of CTSO rs10030044 and ZNF423 rs8060157. We then investigated the relationship between CTSO rs10030044 genotypes and mRNA expression levels of CTSO and BRCA1 in 290 breast cancer patients. Results: We found a positive correlation between the variant GG genotype of CTSO rs10030044 and shorter disease-free survival, or overall survival in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. In contrast, this genotype was not associated with prognosis in hormone receptor-negative breast cancer patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that this genotype was an independent factor indicating a poor prognosis in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. No association was found between CTSO genotype and mRNA expression of CTSO and BRCA1.ZNF423 rs8060157 genotype was not associated with prognosis in this study. Conclusion: We show that a SNP near the CTSO gene is a poor prognostic factor in breast cancer although further research might help to reveal the factors linking this genotype and prognosis. ? 2015, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",Breast cancer; CTSO; Estrogen receptor; Hormone receptor; Polymorphism; Tamoxifen,"epidermal growth factor receptor 2; estrogen receptor alpha; messenger RNA; progesterone receptor; tamoxifen; antineoplastic hormone agonists and antagonists; BRCA1 protein; BRCA1 protein, human; cathepsin; CTSO protein, human; DNA binding protein; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; ERBB2 protein, human; estrogen receptor; messenger RNA; OAZ protein, human; progesterone receptor; adjuvant therapy; adult; age; Article; breast carcinoma; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer size; cancer survival; CTSO gene; disease free survival; female; gene; gene expression; genetic association; genotype; human; human tissue; major clinical study; overall survival; postmenopause; premenopause; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; tumor suppressor gene; adjuvant chemotherapy; Breast Neoplasms; chemistry; genetics; middle aged; prognosis; single nucleotide polymorphism; tumor recurrence; Antineoplastic Agents, Hormonal; BRCA1 Protein; Breast Neoplasms; Cathepsins; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Disease-Free Survival; DNA-Binding Proteins; Female; Genotype; Humans; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prognosis; Receptor, ErbB-2; Receptors, Estrogen; Receptors, Progesterone; RNA, Messenger; Tamoxifen",2-s2.0-84944526992

However, nonpalpable testicular tumors in this condition have never been reported. We describe a case of nonpalpable pure testicular seminoma with elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein presenting retroperitoneal metastasis. Case presentation: A 29-year-old Asian man was referred to our hospital with right flank pain. Computed tomography showed a mass located between his aorta and inferior vena cava, but a testicular tumor was not detected. His serum levels of lactate dehydrogenase, alpha-fetoprotein, and DUPAN-2 were high. Although no tumor or nodule was palpable in his testis, ultrasonography revealed multiple low echoic lesions in his right testicular parenchyma. He was diagnosed with right testicular cancer with retroperitoneal lymph node metastasis and underwent right high orchiectomy. A pathological examination revealed pure seminoma and no nonseminomatous components were found in the specimen. Three courses of induction systemic chemotherapy (cisplatin, etoposide, and bleomycin) normalized his serum alpha-fetoprotein and DUPAN-2 levels. Three additional courses of chemotherapy (etoposide and bleomycin) were performed, and treatment was completed with laparoscopic retroperitoneal lymph node dissection. Pathology of the dissected specimen showed fibrous and necrotic tissue with no viable cells. He is alive without recurrence 54 months after orchiectomy. Conclusions: We report a case of pure testicular seminoma with elevated serum alpha-fetoprotein and DUPAN-2 presenting retroperitoneal metastasis.

Methods: The effect of additional hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ; 12.5 mg/day) to ARB treatment (valsartan; 80 mg/day) on glomerulotubular Na balance was evaluated in 23 patients with chronic kidney disease. Results: Add-on HCTZ decreased GFR, tubular Na load, and tubular Na reabsorption (tNa), although 24-hour urinary Na excretion (UNaV) remained constant. Daily urinary angiotensinogen excretion (UAGTV, 152±10'82±17 μg/g Cre) reduced (p=0.02). Changes in tubular Na load (r2=0.26) and tNa (r2=0.25) correlated with baseline 24-hour UAGTV. Changes in filtered Na load correlated with changes in nighttime systolic BP (r2=0.17), but not with changes in daytime systolic BP. The change in the tNa to filtered Na load ratio was influenced by the change in daytime UNaV (β='0.67, F=16.8), rather than the change in nighttime UNaV. Conclusions: Lower Na balance was produced by add-on HCTZ to ARB treatment without an increase of intra-renal renin-angiotensin system activity, leading to restoration of nocturnal hypertension.

Pathologic sympathetic activity can alter heart rate variability (HRV), and the altered HRV has prognostic importance, so that reducing sympathetic activity may be an important strategy. Novel nonlinear HRVs, including deceleration capacity (DC), have greater predictive power for mortality. We have recently proposed an increase in a non-Gaussianity index of HRV, λ25s, which indicates the probability of volcanic heart rate deviations of departure from each standard deviation level, as a marker of sympathetic cardiac overdrive. L/T-type calcium channel blocker (L/T-CCB), azelnidipine, decreases sympathetic nerve activity in experimental and clinical studies. Methods: In 43 hypertensive patients with CKD under treatment with an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), we investigated whether 8-week add-on L/T-CCB treatment could restore HRV. Results: Means of all normal-to-normal intervals over 24 h (p&lt;0.0001) and DC (p=0.002) increased, and λ25s (p=0.001) decreased regardless of gender, age, renal function or blood pressure, while no significant changes were observed in the other HRVs. Conclusions: Reduction of λ25s is useful to assess the effect of sympathoinhibitory treatment. Further studies are needed to investigate if the restoration of HRV is directly associated with the improvement of prognosis in patients with CKD. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Angiotensin receptor blocker; calcium channel blocker; chronic kidney disease; deceleration capacity; non-Gaussian heart rate variability,"angiotensin receptor antagonist; azelnidipine; calcium channel blocking agent; calcium channel L type; calcium channel T type; L T type calcium channel blocker; olmesartan; unclassified drug; angiotensin receptor antagonist; azelnidipine; azetidine 2 carboxylic acid; calcium channel blocking agent; calcium channel L type; calcium channel T type; dihydropyridine derivative; add on therapy; Article; blood pressure measurement; chronic kidney disease; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; disease association; drug efficacy; drug response; female; heart rate variability; human; hypertension; kidney function; male; outcome assessment; analogs and derivatives; analysis of variance; chronic kidney failure; clinical trial; drug effects; heart rate; metabolism; normal distribution; pathophysiology; Analysis of Variance; Angiotensin Receptor Antagonists; Azetidinecarboxylic Acid; Calcium Channel Blockers; Calcium Channels, L-Type; Calcium Channels, T-Type; Dihydropyridines; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Male; Normal Distribution; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",2-s2.0-84976505179

Many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are involved in regulating this type of growth. Factor for adipocyte differentiation 04 gene (fad104) is a regulator of adipogenesis and osteogenesis. Previously, we reported that fad104 suppressed metastasis as well as invasion of melanoma cells. However, it is unclear whether fad104 is involved in malignant transformation, which is associated with metastasis. In this study, we revealed that fad104 negatively regulated the colony forming activity of melanoma cells. The presence of the N-terminal region of FAD104 was required for the regulation of malignant transformation of melanoma cells. In addition, the deletion mutant of FAD104 that contained the N-terminal region and transmembrane domain interacted with signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and suppressed STAT3 activity. However, the deletion mutant of FAD104 lacking the N-terminal region did not influence the interaction with STAT3 or suppress the STAT3 activity.

In severe cases, malnutrition can progress to cachexia, a specific form of malnutrition characterized by loss of lean body mass and muscle wasting. Although this muscle wasting might be a product of enhanced protein degradation, the precise mechanisms of cancer cachexia are not fully elucidated. Based on basic and clinical research, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance have been postulated to be associated with cancer cachexia. Since insulin in the skeletal muscle inhibits protein degradation and promotes protein synthesis, insulin resistance could be a possible cause of cancer cachexia. Therefore, we investigated the involvement of insulin resistance in the development of cancer cachexia in tumor-bearing mice. The signaling protein in the insulin cascade was attenuated in the skeletal muscle and hypothalamus from tumor-bearing mice. We identified Chrysanthemum morifolium RAMAT., known as Kikuka, as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) ligand. Treatment with Kikuka attenuates the skeletal muscle changes in tumor-bearing mice. These results suggest that this natural PPARγ activator might be an attractive candidate for the treatment of cancer cachexia. In the symposium, we presented the PPARγ activator-induced improvement of cancer cachexia. ? 2016 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Cancer cachexia; Insulin resistance; Kikuka (Chrysanthemum morifolium RAMAT); Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ; Sarcopenia,"Chrysanthemum morifolium extract; plant extract; unclassified drug; insulin; ligand; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; plant extract; animal experiment; animal model; cachexia; Chrysanthemum morifolium; hypothalamus; insulin resistance; mouse; nonhuman; Review; skeletal muscle; animal; cachexia; Chrysanthemum; complication; disease course; disease model; glucose intolerance; human; insulin resistance; malnutrition; neoplasm; physiology; phytotherapy; protein degradation; Animals; Cachexia; Chrysanthemum; Disease Models, Animal; Disease Progression; Glucose Intolerance; Humans; Insulin; Insulin Resistance; Ligands; Malnutrition; Mice; Neoplasms; Phytotherapy; Plant Extracts; PPAR gamma; Proteolysis",2-s2.0-84964770311

Mutations in covR/S or rgg, negative regulators, can reportedly modulate the severity of infection in this pathogen. Recently, we showed that the regions encoding the SalR-SalK, a two-component regulatory system, were deleted in some emm 1-type isolates (named as 'novel-type'). In this study, the two novel 'STSS' isolates 10-85stss and 11-171stss were more virulent than the two novel 'non-STSS' isolates 11O-2non and 11T-3non when examined using a mouse model of invasive infection. Genome-sequencing experiments using the three strains 10-85stss, 11-171stss, and 11O-2non detected only one single nucleotide polymorphism that causes a non-synonymous mutation in fabT encoding a transcriptional regulator in strain 11O-2non. Loss of fabT reduced the high level of virulence observed in the STSS isolates to that in the non-STSS isolates, and introduction of an intact fabT compensated the lower virulence of 11O-2non, suggesting that the mutation in fabT, but not in covR/S or rgg, is involved in the differential virulence among the novel-type clinical isolates. This type of non-synonymous fabT mutation was also identified in 12 non-STSS isolates (including 11O-2non and 11T-3non), and most of those 12 isolates showed impaired FabT function. ? 2016 APMIS Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",fab; fabT; Streptococcus; Streptococcus pyogenes; Virulence,"animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bacterium isolate; controlled study; DNA sequence; fabT gene; female; gene expression; gene mutation; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; salRK gene; single nucleotide polymorphism; spontaneous mutation; streptococcal toxic shock syndrome; Streptococcus pyogenes; toxic shock syndrome; transcription regulation; animal; disease model; genetics; human; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; isolation and purification; microbiology; missense mutation; pathogenicity; pathology; regulator gene; septic shock; Streptococcus infection; Streptococcus pyogenes; virulence; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Genes, Regulator; Genome, Bacterial; Humans; Mice, Inbred ICR; Mutation, Missense; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Shock, Septic; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes; Virulence",2-s2.0-84962868636

These agents also inhibit vascular inflammation (eg, in atherosclerosis). This study was undertaken to determine whether and how vildagliptin (a potent dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor) might reduce intimal hyperplasia in vein grafts. Methods Twelve rabbits were randomly divided into two groups; one group received vildagliptin orally (10 mg/kg/d; n = 6), whereas the control group (n = 6) did not. Vildagliptin administration was started 7 days before rabbits underwent interposition reversed autologous jugular vein grafting and ended at graft harvesting (28 days after the operation). Histochemical changes in the vascular wall were examined, as were changes in the acetylcholine-induced effects on the endothelial Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) and endothelium-dependent relaxation. Results Under fasting conditions, vildagliptin increased the plasma GLP-1 concentration, without affecting plasma glucose or insulin. Acetylcholine induced endothelium-dependent relaxation only in the vildagliptin group, and this was blocked by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor Nω-nitro-l-arginine. Acetylcholine did not modify the endothelial [Ca2+]i in either the control or vildagliptin group. Intimal hyperplasia was significantly less in the vildagliptin group (0.11 ± 0.02 mm, n = 5) than in the controls (0.31 ± 0.06 mm, n = 4; P &lt;.01). Conclusions Vildagliptin increased the plasma GLP-1 concentration. It also enhanced acetylcholine-induced [Ca2+]i-independent endothelial nitric oxide release and reduced vein graft intimal hyperplasia, independently of any glycemic control action.

We conducted an on-site ecological study to investigate the association between the stomach cancer incidence and Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Recruiting 291 healthy persons (136 men and 155 women) from the general population in Bali, Indonesia, we conducted a urea breath test (UBT) to examine H. pylori infection, along with a pepsinogen test to detect chronic atrophic gastritis and urine analysis to estimate sodium and potassium excretion. UBT positivities were 9% (2-15, 95% confidence interval) for men and 7% (1-12) for women, and positive cases for H. pylori IgG antibodies were 1% (0-3) for men and 3% (0-5) for women, significantly lower than the respective values in Japan. Positive pepsinogen tests in Bali were 0% (0-0) for men and 1% (0-4) for women, also significantly lower than the Japanese figures. Computed values for daily salt excretion were 13.3±4.1 g (mean ± SD) for men and 11.1±3.1 g for women, as high as corresponding Japanese consumption values. Moreover, the estimated potassium excretion was 3.2±0.7 g for men and 2.8±0.6 g for women in Bali, significantly higher than the figures in Japan. There were no associations across genetic polymorphisms of IL-beta, TNF-alpha, and PTPN11 with UBT positivity. The low incidence of stomach cancer in Bali may thus mainly be due to the rare H. pylori infection.

Previous studies have shown that NHERF1 functions as a tumor suppressor. The goal of this study is to determine whether the loss of NHERF2 alters colorectal cancer (CRC) progress. We found that NHERF2 expression is elevated in advanced-stage CRC. Knockdown of NHERF2 decreased cancer cell proliferation in vitro and in a mouse xenograft tumor model. In addition, deletion of NHERF2 in ApcMin/+ mice resulted in decreased tumor growth in ApcMin/+ mice and increased lifespan. Blocking NHERF2 interaction with a small peptide designed to bind the second PDZ domain of NHERF2 attenuated cancer cell proliferation. Although NHERF2 is known to facilitate the effects of lysophosphatidic acid receptor 2 (LPA2), transcriptome analysis of xenograft tumors revealed that NHERF2-dependent genes largely differ from LPA2-regulated genes. Activation of β-catenin and ERK1/2 was mitigated in ApcMin/+;Nherf2-/- adenomas. Moreover, Stat3 phosphorylation and CD24 expression levels were suppressed in ApcMin/+;Nherf2-/- adenomas. Consistently, NHERF2 knockdown attenuated Stat3 activation and CD24 expression in colon cancer cells. Interestingly, CD24 was important in the maintenance of Stat3 phosphorylation, whereas NHERF2-dependent increase in CD24 expression was blocked by inhibition of Stat3, suggesting that NHERF2 regulates Stat3 phosphorylation through a positive feedback mechanism between Stat3 and CD24. In summary, this study identifies NHERF2 as a novel oncogenic protein and a potential target for cancer treatment.

During the early stages of hypertension, the heart can be transiently, but frequently, exposed to increased afterload. This study was designed to test the hypothesis that left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) assessed by electrocardiography (ECG) can be used to predict future development of hypertension. Sokolow-Lyon voltage and Cornell product were calculated using ECG in 5770 normotensive participants who visited our hospital for a physical checkup (age 52.7 ± 11.3 years). LVH was defined as a Sokolow-Lyon voltage of >3.8 mV or a Cornell product of >2440 mm × ms. After baseline examination, participants were followed up with the endpoint being the development of hypertension. During the median follow-up period of 1089 days (15,789 person-years), hypertension developed in 1029 participants (65.2/1000 person-years). A Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated a significantly higher incidence of hypertension in participants with LVH than in those without LVH as assessed by Sokolow-Lyon voltage or Cornell product (P < 0.0001 for both). The hazard ratios for incident hypertension in participants with LVH defined by Sokolow-Lyon voltage and Cornell product were 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.16-1.90, P < 0.01) and 1.34 (95% CI 1.09-1.65, P < 0.01), respectively, after adjustment for possible risk factors. Furthermore, in multivariable Cox hazard analysis, where Sokolow-Lyon voltage and Cornell product were taken as continuous variables, both indices were independent predictors of future hypertension (P < 0.0001).

The absence of LPA2 attenuates tumor progression in rodent models of colorectal cancer, but whether overexpression of LPA2 alone can lead to malignant transformation in the intestinal tract has not been studied. In this study, we expressed human LPA2 in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) under control of the villin promoter. Less than 4% of F1-generation mice had germline transmission of transgenic (TG) human LPA2; as such only 3 F1 mice out of 72 genotyped had TG expression. These TG mice appeared anemic with hematochezia and died shortly after birth. TG mice were smaller in size compared with the wild type mouse of the same age and sex. Morphological analysis showed that TG LPA2 colon had hyper-proliferation of IECs resulting in increased colonic crypt depth. Surprisingly, TG small intestine had villus blunting and decreased IEC proliferation and dysplasia. In both intestine and colon, TG expression of LPA2 compromised the terminal epithelial differentiation, consistent with epithelial dysplasia. Furthermore, we showed that epithelial dysplasia was observed in founder mouse intestine, correlating LPA2 overexpression with epithelial dysplasia. The current study demonstrates that overexpression of LPA2 alone can lead to intestinal dysplasia. ? 2016 Yoshida et al.

Although the middle and late stages of adipocyte differentiation are well characterized, the earliest step in the differentiation process has remained largely unknown. We isolated 102 genes expressed at the beginning of the differentiation of a mouse preadipo-cyte cell line, 3T3-L1 cells. Because approximately half of these genes were unknown, we named them factor for adipo?cyte differentiation (fad) genes. I first show how these genes regulate the early stage of adipocyte differentiation. We next generated fad104-deficient mice, and demonstrated that fad104-deficient mice died due to cyanosis-associated lung dysplasia with atelectasis. We also found that fad104 positively regulated adipocyte differentiation and negatively regu?lated osteoblast differentiation. We then demonstrated thatfad24-knockdown inhibited mitotic clonal expansion (MCE) and that FAD24 contributed to the regulation of DNA replication by recruiting histone acetyltransferase binding to ORC1 (HBO1) to DNA replication origins. In vitro culture experiments revealed that fad24-null embryos developed normally to the morula stage, but acquired growth defects in subsequent stages. These results strongly suggest that fad24 is essential for pre-implantation in embryonic development, particularly for progression to the blastocyst stage. These indings together indicate that both fad104 and fad24 contribute not only to adipogenesis but also to other physiological events. The multi-functional roles of these genes are discussed. ? 2016 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Adipocyte differentiation; DNA replication; Embryonic development; Lung maturation; Obesity; Osteoblast differentiation,"adipophilin; basic leucine zipper transcription factor; Fad104 protein, mouse; fibronectin; Noc3l protein, mouse; nuclear protein; adipocyte; adipogenesis; animal cell; atelectasis; blastocyst; cell differentiation; cyanosis; DNA replication; factor for adipocyte differentiation gene; gene; gene function; lung dysplasia; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; osteoblast; preimplantation embryo; proadipocyte; Review; risk factor; 3T3-L1 cell line; adipocyte; animal; cell differentiation; cytology; embryo development; genetics; metabolism; physiology; 3T3-L1 Cells; Adipocytes; Adipogenesis; Animals; Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Cell Differentiation; DNA Replication; Embryonic Development; Fibronectins; Mice; Nuclear Proteins",2-s2.0-84962430668

After irradiation (median, 40?Gy) to the tumor plus a prophylactic volume, a reduced treatment volume to the tumor was boosted (median, 10?Gy). Twelve patients underwent chemoradiotherapy and 3 patients received radiotherapy alone. A complete response was achieved in 12 and a partial response in 3 patients. The 5-year OS, PFS, and LC rates were 80, 67, and 93?%, respectively. Distant recurrence occurred in 4 patients and locoregional and distant recurrence in 1 patient. Cataract (grade 3) and dry eye (grade 2) were observed as late adverse events in 1 patient each. Conclusions: Sufficiently high OS and LC were achieved with acceptable toxicities. Appropriate target volumes may be smaller with newer chemotherapy regimens. ? 2016, Japan Radiological Society.","Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type; Head and neck; Lymphoma; Radiation therapy","cyclophosphamide; doxorubicin; etoposide; eye drops; prednisone; vincristine; adult; aged; allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; alopecia; Article; blood toxicity; brain infarction; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer control; cancer localization; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; cataract; chemoradiotherapy; chemotherapy induced emesis; clinical article; conjunctivitis; cornea ulcer; dry eye; dysgeusia; epiphora; epistaxis; eyelid disease; febrile neutropenia; female; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; keratitis; leukopenia; male; middle aged; middle ear disease; mucosa inflammation; multimodality cancer therapy; NK T cell lymphoma; nose disease; nose obstruction; optic nerve disease; overall survival; photophobia; pneumonia; priority journal; progression free survival; radiation dermatitis; radiation dose; radiation field; retrospective study; testis cancer; therapy effect; thrombocytopenia; treatment outcome; xerostomia; chemoradiotherapy; clinical trial; Japan; Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell; multicenter study; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Nose Neoplasms; procedures; Radiation Injuries; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chemoradiotherapy; Female; Humans; Japan; Lymphoma, Extranodal NK-T-Cell; Male; Middle Aged; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Nose Neoplasms; Radiation Injuries; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84957602567

RA patients who started their first biologics including infliximab, etanercept, adalimumab, and tocilizumab between 2003 and 2008 were identified in the Tsurumai Biologics Communication Registry (TBCR), multicenter observational cohort, and followed for 2 years or until discontinuation of the drugs. We identified baseline predictors for adverse events (AEs) resulting in discontinuation of the first TNFI using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. A total of 874 cases (1,340 person-years) were observed. During the observation period, 96 AEs (4.7 events/100 person-years) occurred. From 2003 to 2008, there were significant changes in disease duration, Steinbrocker stage, and disease activity in those aged ?64 years with no increase of incidence of AEs, whereas those aged >64 years had no significant changes in these variables. In the later initiation year of treatment with biologics, the fewer AEs were observed (log-rank, p = 0.017, 2008 vs. 2003–2005). Multivariate analysis showed that the initiation year significantly impacted the incidence of AEs 6 months into the observation period [initiation at 2008 (vs. 2003–2005): OR: 0.30, 95 % CI: (0.14–0.68)] after adjusting for variables at baseline. The decrease of AEs in the later initiation year was evident in those aged >64 years. The safety of biologic therapy improved over the course of the 8 years from its implementation in Japan. ?

A recent genome-wide association study analysis identified a novel association between genetic variations in the BCHE locus and amyloid burden. We studied BChE immunoreactivity in hippocampal tissue sections from AD and control cases, and examined its relationship with amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), dystrophic neurites (DN) and neuropil threads (NT). Compared to controls, AD cases had greater BChE immunoreactivity in hippocampal neurons and neuropils in CA2/3, but not in the CA1, CA4 and dentate gyrus. The majority of amyloid plaques (>80%, using a pan-amyloid marker X-34) contained discrete neuritic clusters which were dual-labeled with antibodies against BChE and phosphorylated tau (clone AT8). There was no association between overall regional BChE immunoreaction intensity and amyloid plaque burden. In contrast to previous reports, BChE was localized in only a fraction (~10%) of classic NFT (positive for X-34). A similar proportion of BChE-immunoreactive pyramidal cells were AT8 immunoreactive. Greater NFT and DN loads were associated with greater BChE immunoreaction intensity in CA2/3, but not in CA1, CA4 and dentate gyrus. Our results demonstrate that in AD hippocampus, BChE accumulates in neurons and plaque-associated neuritic clusters, but only in a small proportion of NFT. The association between greater neurofibrillary pathology burden and markedly increased BChE immunoreactivity, observed selectively in CA2/3 region, could reflect a novel compensatory mechanism. Since CA2/3 is generally considered more resistant to AD pathology, BChE upregulation could impact the cholinergic modulation of glutamate neurotransmission to prevent/reduce neuronal excitotoxicity in AD hippocampus. ? 2016 Japanese Society of Neuropathology.",Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid; Butyrylcholinesterase; Hippocampus; Tau,"cholinesterase; cholinesterase; aged; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; Article; brain weight; cholinesterase blood level; clinical article; controlled study; dentate gyrus; dentate hilus; female; genetic variability; hippocampal CA1 region; hippocampal CA2 region; hippocampal CA3 region; hippocampal tissue; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; male; neurofibrillary tangle; neuropil; neuropil thread; priority journal; pyramidal nerve cell; very elderly; Alzheimer disease; biosynthesis; enzymology; hippocampus; immunohistochemistry; nerve cell; pathology; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Butyrylcholinesterase; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Neurofibrillary Tangles; Neurons; Neuropil Threads; Plaque, Amyloid",2-s2.0-84939857479

The purpose of this study was to compare in-hospital outcomes of elective THA and TKA between patients with and without RA in the US during the last decade. We hypothesised that patients with RA would have similar perioperative outcomes after elective THA and TKA. Methods Clinical data were derived from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS) between 2000 and 2009. Patients who underwent elective THA and TKA were identified. Data regarding patient- and healthcare system-related characteristics, comorbidities, in-hospital complications, and mortality were retrieved. In-hospital outcomes of the procedures were compared between patients with and without RA. Results Comparison between patients with and without RA showed that patients with RA had significantly lower overall in-hospital complication rates following THA and TKA, and lower in-hospital mortality rate following THA. Patients with RA undergoing THA and TKA had decreased risk of overall in-hospital complications compared to those without RA. Conclusion Contrary to our hypothesis, perioperative outcomes of elective THA and TKA in patients with RA were better than those in patients without RA. These results may indicate that patient selection and pre- and perioperative management of patients with RA undergoing elective THA and TKA were well conducted in the US during the last decade. ?

Chloroplast 5′-UTRs also support translation of the coding regions of heterologous genes. Using an in vitro translation system from tobacco chloroplasts, we detected no translation from a human immunodeficiency virus tat coding region fused directly to the tobacco chloroplast psbA 5′-UTR. This lack of apparent translation could have been due to rapid degradation of mRNA templates or synthesized protein products. Replacing the psbA 5′-UTR with the E. coli phage T7 gene 10 5′-UTR, a highly active 5′-UTR, and substituting synonymous codons led to some translation of the tat coding region. The Tat protein thus synthesized was stable during translation reactions. No significant degradation of the added tat mRNAs was observed after translation reactions. These results excluded the above two possibilities and confirmed that the tat coding region prevented its own translation. The tat coding region was then fused to the psbA 5′-UTR with a cognate 5′-coding segment. Significant translation was detected from the tat coding region when fused after 10 or more codons. That is, translation could be initiated from the tat coding region once translation had started, indicating that the tat coding region inhibits translational initiation but not elongation. Hence, cooperation/compatibility between the 5′-UTR and its coding region is important for translational initiation. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",5′-untranslated region; chloroplast; human immunodeficiency virus tat gene; in vitro; initiation codon; mRNA; psbA; translation; translation initiation region,"Biosynthesis; Diseases; Escherichia coli; Genes; Machinery; Proteins; Tobacco; Translation (languages); Viruses; chloroplast; Human immunodeficiency virus; In-vitro; initiation codon; mRNA; psbA; Untranslated regions; Codes (symbols); 5' untranslated region; messenger RNA; plant protein; start codon; transactivator protein; 5' untranslated region; chloroplast; Enterobacteria phage T7; genetics; metabolism; protein stability; protein synthesis; RNA stability; start codon; tobacco; 5' Untranslated Regions; Bacteriophage T7; Chloroplasts; Codon, Initiator; Plant Proteins; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Stability; RNA Stability; RNA, Messenger; tat Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus; Tobacco",2-s2.0-84962349389

However, the neural effects of cholinesterase inhibitors on both apathy and executive dysfunction remain unclear. We examined whether baseline regional cerebral blood flow, as determined by using single-photon emission computed tomography, is capable of predicting changes in apathy and executive dysfunction in response to AD patients switching from donepezil to galantamine therapy. Methods: We conducted a 24-week, prospective, open-label study of AD patients treated with galantamine who did not respond to previous treatment with donepezil. Single-photon emission computed tomography was performed at baseline, and behaviour and cognitive assessments including the Mini-Mental State Examination, the Japanese version of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, the Frontal Assessment Battery, the Neuropsychiatry Inventory Brief Questionnaire Form, and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire were conducted at three time points (baseline and after 12 and 24 weeks of galantamine therapy). Results: After galantamine therapy, the Neuropsychiatry Inventory Brief Questionnaire Form scores (apathy, irritability, and aberrant motor symptoms) and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire score improved significantly. The single-photon emission computed tomography findings showed that lower baseline regional cerebral blood flow values in several frontal areas, including the dorsolateral and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate, and the orbitofrontal cortex, predicted greater reductions in the score for apathy (distress) on the Neuropsychiatry Inventory Brief Questionnaire Form and the Dysexecutive Questionnaire score after patients switched from donepezil to galantamine therapy. Conclusions: Our study suggests that galantamine therapy, unlike donepezil, is characterized by a dual mechanism of action that may increase acetylcholine and the nicotinic receptor-modulation effect within the frontal lobe, both of which are associated with apathy and executive dysfunction in AD patients. ? 2016 Japanese Psychogeriatric Society.",Apathy; Donepezil; Executive function; Galantamine; SPECT; Switching,"cysteine ethyl ester tc 99m; donepezil; galantamine; cholinesterase inhibitor; donepezil; galantamine; indan derivative; piperidine derivative; aged; Alzheimer disease; Alzheimer Disease Assessment Scale; anterior cingulate; apathy; Article; brain blood flow; clinical article; clinical trial; cognitive function test; collimator; dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; drug dose increase; drug substitution; drug withdrawal; Dysexecutive Questionnaire; executive function; female; Frontal Assessment Battery; gamma camera; human; Japanese (people); male; Mini Mental State Examination; neuroimaging; Neuropsychiatry Inventory Brief Questionnaire; open study; orbital cortex; priority journal; prospective study; single photon emission computer tomography; ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; Alzheimer disease; drug effects; mental health; middle aged; neuropsychological test; procedures; single photon emission computer tomography; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Apathy; Cholinesterase Inhibitors; Executive Function; Female; Galantamine; Humans; Indans; Male; Mental Status Schedule; Middle Aged; Neuropsychological Tests; Piperidines; Prospective Studies; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",2-s2.0-84960965309

Japanese Kampo medicine and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) are both derived from ancient medicines used in East Asia in the 5th-7th centuries, and have developed independently since the 14th century. Now Kampo medicine and TCM have different theories for the diagnosis and use of crude drugs. Unfortunately, Kampo medicine is not well known in Europe and the Americas; as a matter of practice, TCM is the international standard for traditional medicines derived from ancient East Asia. In the teaching of Kampo medicines to undergraduate students in a school of pharmacy, the author considers that a minimum requirement is to explain the differences between TCM and Kampo medicine. For graduate students of pharmaceutical science, the students must know the distinct medical theories of both TCM and Kampo medicine, and furthermore, must be able to read and write articles in English about traditional medicines, in order to help put Kampo medicine on the world map. ? 2016 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Education; Internationalization; Kampo medicine; Traditional chinese medicine,"alternative medicine; Asia; Chinese medicine; human; integrative medicine; medical education; medical student; Review; traditional medicine; undergraduate student; Chinese medicine; education; international cooperation; pharmacognosy; procedures; standards; teaching; trends; Education, Pharmacy; Humans; Internationality; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Medicine, Kampo; Pharmacognosy; Teaching",2-s2.0-84959419556

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of multi-detector row computed tomography (MDCT)-guided marking technique before BCS in patients in whom ultrasound (US)-guided marking was not feasible. Methods: Between 2004 and 2010, 94 lesions underwent contrast-enhanced MDCT-guided marking. Margin positivity and local control rates were compared with those of 149 lesions undergoing US-guided marking during the same period. Results: In 21 lesions undergoing CT marking (22?%) and 20 lesions undergoing US marking (13?%), a negative resection margin could not be achieved, and hence the marking was judged as unsuccessful. Eighty-four lesions of the CT marking group and 119 of the US marking group received postoperative radiotherapy with 50?Gy in 25 fractions with or without an additional 10-Gy boost to the tumor bed. The remaining 10 and 30 patients, respectively, did not receive radiotherapy. The median follow-up period was 54 and 51?months for patients with CT marking and those with US marking, respectively. At 4 postoperative years, the local control rate was 96.5?% for patients with CT marking and 97.3?% for those with US marking (P?=?0.89). Conclusions: The MDCT marking technique appears to be a valuable tool for determining the surgical margin for BCS in patients in whom ultrasound marking cannot be performed. Combining this technique with appropriate postoperative radiation therapy is expected to yield reasonably high local control rates. ? 2014, The Japanese Breast Cancer Society.",Breast cancer; Breast-conserving surgery; Local control; MDCT; Preoperative marking,"adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer control; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; clinical article; contrast enhancement; controlled study; female; histopathology; human; human tissue; image marker; imaging and display; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; partial mastectomy; priority journal; Breast Neoplasms; cancer staging; comparative study; computer assisted surgery; devices; diagnostic imaging; echomammography; follow up; partial mastectomy; pathology; procedures; prognosis; spiral computer assisted tomography; survival rate; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Prognosis; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; Survival Rate; Tomography, Spiral Computed; Ultrasonography, Mammary",2-s2.0-84959287939

Furthermore, in the subgroup analysis by source of control, no obvious association was observed in neither population-based (dominant genetic model OR = 0.95, 95% CI = 0.87-1.03, Pheterogeneity = 0.084, P = 0.224, I2 = 36.5) or hospital-based studies (OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.49-1.12, Pheterogeneity = 0.087, P = 0.157, I2 = 48.0). In conclusion, VDR BsmI polymorphism may be related to prostate cancer in Caucasian descendants. Future well-designed and more diverse case-control populations are warranted to further evaluate this conclusion in more detail. ? 2016, International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine.

Polymorphisms of the XPC gene have been analyzed in numerous case-control studies to evaluate bladder cancer risk attributed to XPC genetic variation; however, published data on the association between XPC rs2228001 A/C and bladder cancer risk are inconclusive. To assess the impact of XPC rs2228001 polymorphism on bladder cancer risk, we performed a meta-analysis on all available studies including 4,741 patients and 5,065 control subjects. The overall results indicated a positive association of the variant on bladder cancer risk using an allelic contrast, homozygote comparison and the recessive genetic model. When stratified by ethnicity, obvious associations were found in Asian descendants by using an allelic contrast (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.06-1.66, Pheterogeneity = 0.002), homozygote comparison (OR = 1.91, 95% CI = 1.30-2.82, Pheterogeneity = 0.040) and the recessive genetic model (OR = 1.64, 95% CI = 1.25-2.15, Pheterogeneity = 0.128).

We previously developed and characterized monoclonal antibodies 31-2 and 75-2 that specifically bind to nonfibrillar Aβ1-42 aggregates with diameters of more than 220 and 50?nm, respectively. Here, we report the use of these antibodies to examine the aggregation of exogenous Aβ1-42 in cultured rat hippocampal neurons. From 6 to 24?h after transfection of Aβ1-42, antibody 75-2 immunolabeled almost all transfected neurons, whereas 31-2-positive cells were restricted to a part of the transfected neurons and gradually increased in number. Expression of the F19S/L34P-mutant Aβ1-42, which showed less of a tendency to aggregate, resulted in clearly reduced immunoreactivity to both antibodies. We also immunohistochemically investigated the temporal cortices of patients with AD and found that 31-2 preferentially labeled the cores of a subpopulation of large amyloid plaques. The relative number of 31-2-immunoreactive plaques was found to correlate with the Braak stages of neurofibrillary tangles, but not with that of amyloid plaques. These results suggest that 31-2-reactive Aβ aggregates develop with a delayed time course in cultured neurons and amyloid plaques of AD brains. ? 2016 the Molecular Biology Society of Japan and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.",,"amyloid beta protein[1-42]; monoclonal antibody; monoclonal antibody 31 2; monoclonal antibody 75 2; unclassified drug; amyloid beta protein; Alzheimer disease; amyloid plaque; amyloidosis; animal cell; antibody labeling; Article; controlled study; embryo; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rat; aged; animal; cell culture; cytology; female; genetics; hippocampus; immunohistochemistry; immunology; male; metabolism; mutation; nerve cell; pathology; very elderly; Wistar rat; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Cells, Cultured; Female; Hippocampus; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Mutation; Neurons; Rats; Rats, Wistar",2-s2.0-84956797022

The estimated incidence rate is 5-30 cases per 100,000 people per year. The causes of SSHL and the mechanisms underlying SSHL currently remain unknown. Based on several hypotheses such as a circulatory disturbance to the cochlea, viral infection, and autoimmune disease, pharmaco-therapeutic approaches have been applied to treat SSHL patients; however, the efficacy of the standard treatment, corticosteroid therapy, is still under debate. Exposure to intense sounds has been shown to cause permanent damage to the auditory system; however, exposure to a moderate level enriched acoustic environment after noise trauma may reduce hearing impairments. Several neuroimaging studies recently suggested that the onset of SSHL induced maladaptive cortical reorganization in the human auditory cortex, and that the degree of cortical reorganization in the acute SSHL phase negatively correlated with the recovery rate from hearing loss. This article reports the development of a novel neuro-rehabilitation approach for SSHL, “constraint-induced sound therapy (CIST)”. The aim of the CIST protocol is to prevent or reduce maladaptive cortical reorganization by using an enriched acoustic environment. The canal of the intact ear of SSHL patients is plugged in order to motivate them to actively use the affected ear and thereby prevent progress of maladaptive cortical reorganization. The affected ear is also exposed to music via a headphone for 6 hr per day during hospitalization. The CIST protocol appears to be a safe, easy, inexpensive, and effective treatment for SSHL. ? 2016 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.",Behavior; Brain; Constraint-induced sound therapy; Cortical reorganization; Enriched acoustic environment; Issue 107; Medicine; Music; Neuroscience; Otorhinolaryngology; Rehabilitation; Sudden deafness; Sudden sensorineural hearing loss; Training,"auditory cortex; cochlea; female; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Hearing Loss, Sudden; human; middle aged; pathophysiology; risk factor; sound; treatment outcome; Auditory Cortex; Cochlea; Female; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Hearing Loss, Sudden; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Sound; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85000763519

Pancreatographic findings such as a long narrowing of the main pancreatic duct, lack of upstream dilatation, skipped narrowed lesions, and side branches arising from the narrowed portion suggest AIP rather than pancreatic carcinoma. Cholangiographic findings for PSC, including band - like stricture, beaded or pruned - tree appearance, or diverticulum - like outpouching are rarely observed in IgG4 - SC patients, whereas dilatation after a long stricture of the bile duct is common in IgG4 - SC. Transpapillary biopsy for bile duct stricture is useful to rule out cholangiocarcinoma and to support the diagnosis of IgG4 - SC with IgG4 - immunostaining. IgG4 - immunostaining of biopsy specimens from the major papilla advances a diagnosis of AIP. Contrastenhanced endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and EUS elastography have the potential to predict the histological nature of the lesions. Intraductal ultrasonographic finding of wall thickening in the non - stenotic bile duct on cholangiography is useful for distinguishing IgG4 - SC from cholangiocarcinoma.

To obtain adequate tissue samples for the histological diagnosis of AIP, EUS - Tru - cut biopsy or EUS - FNA using a 19 - gauge needle is recommended, but EUS - FNA with a 22 - gauge needle can also provide sufficient histological samples with careful sample processing after collection and rapid motion of the FNA needles within the pancreas.

Subsequent reports revealed that these IL28B polymorphisms also affect treatment efficacy in chronic infection with other HCV genotypes. Therapy of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) recently has entered a new era with the availability of direct-acting antiviral agents (DAAs). These include non-structural 3/4A protease inhibitors which have shown promise in combination with PEG-IFN/RBV in several clinical trials, as well as in clinical practice. IFN-free therapy is expected to be useful especially for IFN-resistant patients and may become the standard of care in the future. Several clinical trials have revealed an association between IL28B genotype and treatment efficacy in triple therapy and in some interferon-free regimens. Recently, it was shown that a polymorphism of IFN-lambda 4 (IFNL4) is in high linkage disequilibrium with that of near IL28B and more strongly associated with spontaneous or treatment-induced HCV clearance than the IL28B polymorphisms, especially in individuals of African ancestry.

These guidelines focused on the fluid levels to administer to patients with a remaining life expectancy of 1-2 months. However, recent refinement of the concept of cachexia is prompting caregivers worldwide to rethink parenteral fluid management for terminal cancer patients. Objective: Our objective was to develop guidelines for parenteral fluid management for terminal cancer patients with a remaining life expectancy of 1 month, a point when cachexia generally begins to severely adversely affect the body. Methods: The Japanese Society for Palliative Medicine appointed a Guidelines Working Practitioner Group consisting of a multidisciplinary team of specialists. In response to 26 clinical questions on parenteral fluid management for terminal cancer patients, the Working Group used the Delphi method to reach consensus on the recommendability and evidence level of 89 relevant manuscripts identified through a systematic literature review. The Working Group then had an outside committee reviews the draft guidelines validity before authoring the final version. Results: The resulting clinically aligned guidelines contain specific recommendations (25 recommendations on physical suffering/remaining life expectancy, 10 nursing-related recommendations and 4 ethical recommendations) assessed using the Delphi method and by an outside committee. Conclusions: Japanese Society for Palliative Medicine released a revised edition of the Guidelines for Parenteral Fluid Management for Terminal Cancer Patients, which are based on medical evidence and consider the pathologic features of cachexia. We recommend that caregivers carefully evaluate the clinical usefulness of the guidelines. ? The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

However, a previous study advocating the validity of the Distress and Impact Thermometer may have overestimated its effectiveness, as the study included already-treated patients who were not screening targets. This study reevaluated the performance and usefulness of the Distress and Impact Thermometer using an adequate sample size and appropriate study design. Methods: Patients were consecutively recruited at two highly specialized hospitals and three university hospitals in Japan. Inclusion criteria were (i) undergoing aggressive anti-cancer treatment, (ii) the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score < 3 and (iii) age > 20 years. Patients who were receiving psychiatric treatment were excluded from the study. After completing the Distress and Impact Thermometer, patients were evaluated with the gold-standard Composite International Diagnostic Interview by researchers who were blinded to the patients' Distress and Impact Thermometer scores. Results: Forty-four patients (9%) who were receiving psychiatric treatment were excluded. Of 468 subjects included in the final analysis, only 3 had current depression (0.6%). Using cutoff points recommended by the previous study, the positive and negative predictive values were 0.02 and 0.99, respectively. Conclusions: Our data indicated that screening for untreated depression in cancer patients was not useful in the specific clinical settings that were studied, and such screening should be implemented in appropriate contexts. Since there are no evidence-based recommendations regarding contexts in which psychological screening is essential, further research is needed. ? The Author 2016.

Twenty years of follow-up data of male employees enrolled in the DENSO Health Insurance Program were used for analyses. Subjects and Methods: Of 29,048 male employees aged 20–46 years who were enrolled in the insurance program in 1994, 25,084 (86.4%) employees underwent annual health check-ups until 2003 without missing an appointment. Of these 25,084 employees, the data of 11,784 (40.6%) employees who self-reported drinking and smoking habits were used for analyses. The hazard ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for developing cerebrovascular disease in 2004–2013 were calculated in four risk groups categorized as per drinking and smoking behavior in the young group who were in their 20s and the middle-aged group who were in their 30s-40s in 1994. Based on their drinking behavior, participants were categorized into two groups: “not drinking or drinking sometimes” and “drinking every day.” Based on their smoking behavior, participants were also categorized into two groups: “not smoking for 10 years” and “smoking for 10 years.” Results: A Cox's proportional hazard model revealed that after controlling for body mass index, systolic blood pressure, triglycerides, total cholesterol, fasting plasma glucose, and age, the hazard ratios for “smoking and drinking every day” were 3.82 (95% CI: 1.40–10.41) in the young group and 2.31 (95% CI: 1.27–4.17) in the middle-aged group. Discussion: Male employees who had been drinking and smoking for 10 years had a higher risk of developing cerebrovascular diseases. To prevent cerebrovascular diseases among male employees, it may be effective to offer behavior change interventions for both drinking and smoking habits, regardless of the age group. ? 2016, Japan Society for Occupational Health.

Up-to-date information on microneurographic analysis of human cardiovascular and thermoregulatory function in humans, heart rate variability, and 131I-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy are provided. Microneurography, which was originally developed as a technique to analyze the afferent muscle spindle, came to be used to analyze sympathetic nerve activity in the mid–1980s. In the twenty–first century, this technique has become prevalent all over the world especially in investigating the pathophysiology of human cardiovascular function. It is also now used in researching human thermoregulatory function. Heart rate variability is another valuable tool in investigating the current status of human vagal function and in predicting future cardiovascular disease. MIBG is also used to assess cardiac noradrenergic function, especially decreases associated with Parkinson’s disease, Lewy body disease, and multisystem atrophy. Overviews of recent advances in these three important assessments are provided by leading experts.Clinical Assessment of the Autonomic Nervous System is a useful resource for neurologists and researchers of clinical neurophysiology. ?

The efficacy and optimal dose fractionation were investigated. Methods: In a planning study, 63 treatment plans were generated for the following 3 conditions: 1.0-cm fixed jaws (FJ), 2.5-cmFJ and 2.5-cmDJ. In a clinical study, 30Gy/3 fr, 35Gy/5 fr or 37.5Gy/5fr were prescribed depending on tumour size. Clinical results of groups treated with 2.5-cm DJ plans and 1.0-cm FJ were compared. Results: In the planning study, the treatment times in 2.5-cm DJ and FJ plans were less than that in 1.0-cm FJ plans (p,0.001). The brain doses in 1.0-cm FJ plans and 2.5-cm DJ plans were smaller than those in 2.5-cm FJ plans (p,0.05). In the clinical study, 34 patients with 68 BM were treated with SRT. Of those, 15 patients with 34 BM were treated with 2.5-cm DJ plans and 19 patients with 34 BM were treated with 1.0-cm FJ plans. The overall survival and local tumour control (LC) rates were 52 and 93% at 12 months, respectively. The DJ system achieved favourable LC and 29% shorter treatment time compared with the FJ system (p,0.001). Grade 2 or 3 necrosis occurred more frequently in patients with 15 cc or larger tumour volumes (p50.05). Conclusion: DJ technology enables treatment time to be reduced without worsening the dose distribution and clinical efficacy.

One of the reasons for the technical difficulties is the complex relationship between the middle colic vein (MCV) and its tributary. So, defining the venous anatomy around the MCV before laparoscopic surgery seems important to avoid massive bleeding. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the depiction rate and variation of the MCV and its tributaries on three-dimensional CT angiography (3DCTA). Methods: This study included 331 patients (203 males and 128 females) scheduled for laparoscopic surgery between June 2010 and April 2012. Most of the patients had gastric or colorectal cancer. Patients who needed emergency surgeries for obstruction or perforation were excluded. 3DCTA with an i.v. contrast medium was performed immediately following the administration of effervescent granules or room air insufflation. We assessed variations of the MCV tributaries using transaxial, multiplanar reconstructed images and volume-rendering images. Results: The MCV could be identified in all patients. The MCVs drained into the superior mesenteric vein in 62.5% of patients, gastrocolic trunk of Henle in 29.3% of patients, inferior mesenteric vein in 4.8% of patients, splenic vein in 2.7% of patients and jejunal vein in 0.6% of patients. Conclusion: 3DCTA is useful in evaluating the anatomic variants of the MCV in pre-operative planning for laparoscopic surgery. Advances in knowledge: Use of 3DCTA for the recognition of the anatomic complexity around the MCV and its tributary plays an important role in pre-operative planning for optimal patient outcome. ? 2016 The Authors.",,"iohexol; iomeprol; adult; aeration; ambient air; anatomical concepts; Article; cancer surgery; colorectal cancer; computed tomographic angiography; female; gastrocolic trunk of henle; human; laparoscopic surgery; major clinical study; male; mesenteric vein; middle colic vein; splenic vein; stomach; stomach cancer; superior mesenteric vein; three dimensional imaging; vein; aged; anatomy and histology; colon; colon resection; computed tomographic angiography; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; procedures; three dimensional imaging; vascularization; vein; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Colectomy; Colon; Computed Tomography Angiography; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Middle Aged; Veins",2-s2.0-84989328281

However, the prognostic factors for the survival time in DLB with pneumonia have not been investigated by autopsy in patients with neuropathologically confirmed DLB. Methods We conducted a retrospective study of the medical and autopsy reports of 42 patients admitted to a Japanese hospital between 2005 and 2014. The patients were neuropathologically diagnosed as having DLB by post-mortem examinations. We analyzed the effects of various factors on the time from DLB onset to death. Results Thirty-nine of the 42 patients with DLB (92.9%) developed pneumonia during hospitalization. The median age at DLB onset was 78 years and the median time from DLB onset to death was 8 years.

We report a 49-year-old woman with a cavernous pulmonary lymphangioma showing rapid growth after remaining indolent for 10 years. Presentation of case Chest computed tomography revealed a solitary, poorly demarcated mass in the left lower lobe; however, the tumour grew in size over the next 6 months. A left lower lobectomy was performed following suspected lung cancer. Histopathological and immunohistochemical analysis of the resected specimens revealed a pulmonary cavernous lymphangioma. Discussion It is difficult to make an accurate diagnosis of solitary cavernous lymphangioma by imaging findings, therefore a surgical resection is recommended as the diagnostic and therapeutic modality.

Mediators of inflammation, such as leukotrienes, have been identified in patients with acute otitis media (AOM) or subsequent secretory otitis media (SOM). They can cause functional eustachian tube dysfunction or increase mucous in the middle ear, causing persistent SOM following AOM. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether or not administration of pranlukast, a widely used leukotriene C4, D4, and E4 antagonist, together with antibiotics could inhibit the progression to SOM. Methods Children with AOM, who were from two to 12 years old, were randomly divided into two groups as follows: a control group in which 50 patients received antibiotic-based conventional treatment according to guidelines for treating AOM proposed by the Japan Otological Society (version 2006); and a pranlukast group, in which 52 patients were administered pranlukast for up to 28 days as well as given conventional treatment. Cases were regarded as persistent SOM when a tympanogram was type B or C2 four weeks after treatment was initiated. Results Two patients in the pranlukast group and 3 patients in the control group were excluded because they relapsed AOM within 28 days after initial treatment. Therefore, the analysis included 50 and 47 subjects in the pranlukast and control groups, respectively. The percentage of patients diagnosed with persistent SOM (22.0%) was significantly smaller in the pranlukast group compared with the control group (44.7%) (p?=?0.018, chi-squared test). Conclusion The results indicate that combined treatment of AOM with antibiotics and a leukotriene antagonist to control inflammation is useful for preventing progression to persistent SOM. ? 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Acute otitis media; Leukotriene antagonist; Pranlukast; Secretory otitis media,"antibiotic agent; antihistaminic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; pranlukast; antiinfective agent; chromone derivative; leukotriene receptor blocking agent; pranlukast; absence of side effects; acute otitis media; antibiotic resistance; antiinflammatory activity; Article; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; child; clinical article; controlled study; disease classification; disease course; drug efficacy; female; Haemophilus influenzae; human; male; Moraxella catarrhalis; nose disease; otalgia; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; randomized controlled trial; secretory otitis media; Staphylococcus aureus; Streptococcus pneumoniae; treatment duration; tympanometry; acute disease; combination drug therapy; inflammation; otitis media; Otitis Media with Effusion; preschool child; Acute Disease; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromones; Disease Progression; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Humans; Inflammation; Leukotriene Antagonists; Male; Otitis Media; Otitis Media with Effusion",2-s2.0-84979536666

Hypervirulent strains belong to the emm1 genotype, with a mutation in the covR/S genes that regulate many other genes, encoding virulence determinants and resulting in the absence of the proteinase streptococcal exotoxin B and the production of virulence factors such as the superantigen streptococcal exotoxin A, the nuclease streptococcal DNase, the cytotoxin NAD-glycohydrolase, and the hemolysin streptolysin O. We found 1 strain from invasive disease and 1 from non-invasive disease with traits similar to those of hypervirulent strains, except that the sda1 gene was absent. We also found 1 non-emm1 strain with phenotypic and genetic traits identical to those of the emm1 hypervirulent strains except that it did not belong to emm1 genotype, from noninvasive diseases cases in 2011. These findings suggested that hypervirulent and hypervirulent-like strains from invasive and non-invasive disease cases could have at least partially contributed to the sudden increase in the number of patients with STSS in Aichi during 2011. ? 2016, National Institute of Health.

Department of Occupational and Environmental Health, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences-Objectives: Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) in serum detoxifies organophosphate (OP) insecticides by hydrolysis. The present cross-sectional study aimed to clarify the relationship between PON1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and enzyme activities or OP metabolite concentrations in urine of workers occupationally exposed to low-level OPs. Methods: Among 283 workers in 10 pest control companies located in central Japan who underwent checkups, 230 subjects (male 199, female 31, average age 38.9 ± 11.1 years old) participated in the study. Q192R and L55M polymorphisms were determined by TaqMan assay. PON1 activity was measured using fenitrothion (FNT) oxon, chlorpyrifos-methyl (CPM) oxon, chlorpyrifos (CP) oxon, and phenyl acetate as substrates. Urinary OP metabolite concentrations were measured with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: The maximum differences in enzyme 2016activities between individuals were 64.6-, 6.3-, 7.7-, and 2.0-fold for FNT oxonase, CPM oxonase, CP oxonase, and arylesterase (ARE), respectively. The activities of CPM oxonase and ARE in workers having the RR genotype were 53.5% and 18.2% lower than in those with the QQ genotype, respectively. CP oxonase activity was 15.0% lower in those having the M allele (LM + MM compared with LL). Urinary metabolite concentrations were not associated with PON1 polymorphisms, but negative associations were observed between the concentrations and activities of FNT oxonase and ARE. Conclusions: While PON1 SNPs can explain differences in catalytic activities toward some OPs, differences in urinary concentrations of OP metabolites are not attributable to PON1 SNPs but instead are attributable to its serum activities. Its serum activities might be more sensitive biomarkers for estimation of individual susceptibility to OP toxicities.",Metabolism; Organophosphate; Paraoxonase 1; Pesticides; Polymorphism; Urine,"acetic acid derivative; aryldialkylphosphatase; arylesterase; carboxylesterase; chlorpyrifos; chlorpyrifos-methyl; fenitrothion; insecticide; O,O-diethyl O-3,5,6-trichloro-2-pyridyl phosphate; organophosphate; phenol derivative; phenyl acetate; PON1 protein, human; adult; allele; analogs and derivatives; cross-sectional study; female; genetics; genotype; human; Japan; male; mass fragmentography; metabolism; middle aged; occupational exposure; pest control; single nucleotide polymorphism; urine; Acetates; Adult; Alleles; Aryldialkylphosphatase; Carboxylic Ester Hydrolases; Chlorpyrifos; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Fenitrothion; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Genotype; Humans; Insecticides; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Organophosphates; Pest Control; Phenols; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide",2-s2.0-84978952223

Therefore, we retrospectively investigated the optimal approach for Eri dose adjustment and/or dosage interval adjustment. Patients who received Eri at the institutions affiliated with the Division of Oncology of the Aichi Prefectural Society of Hospital Pharmacists between July 2011 and November 2013 were enrolled in this study. We compared the group that underwent dose reduction without changes to their dosage interval (dose reduction group) with the group that had a change in their dosage interval (dose-interval prolongation group). The primary end-point was time to treatment failure (TTF), and the secondary end-points were overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and adverse events. The TTF and OS of the dose reduction group were approximately two times longer than those of the dose-interval prolongation group. In addition, the dose reduction group had significantly improved ORR and CBR, which together indicate an antitumor effect (p=0.013 and 0.002, respectively). Although peripheral neuropathy occurred significantly more frequently in the patients in the dose reduction group (p=0.026), it was grade 1 and controllable in most of the cases. There were no differences in the occurrence of other adverse effects between the two groups. Therefore, we suggest that dose reduction with maintenance of the dosage interval is the preferred treatment approach in cases where Eri dose or schedule modification is necessary. ? 2016 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Dose adjustment; Eribulin mesilate; Metastatic breast cancer; Relative dose intensity,"eribulin; eribulin; furan derivative; ketone; Article; breast metastasis; comparative study; drug dose reduction; drug treatment failure; human; overall survival; peripheral neuropathy; retrospective study; adult; aged; bioassay; Breast Neoplasms; chemically induced; drug administration; female; middle aged; mortality; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; survival rate; treatment failure; treatment outcome; tumor recurrence; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Drug Administration Schedule; Endpoint Determination; Female; Furans; Humans; Ketones; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; Treatment Failure; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84976619897

The long-term clinical response to ADA was retrospectively analyzed in 17 na?ve CD patients for at least 24 months, and the serum trough IFX levels were evaluated in patients switching from ADA to IFX. Of the 17 na?ve CD patients, 14 (82.4%) maintained long-term clinical remission with ADA therapy for at least 24 months, without serious adverse events. The clinical condition of 7 patients was observed for more than 36 months, and 3, 1, 1, and 2 cases maintained remission at months 42, 48, 54, and 60 after ADA therapy, respectively.

Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with alteplase was initiated 3 h and 20 min after the onset of symptoms, and an improvement in neurological symptoms was observed. Echocardiography displayed a mobile mass in the left atrium, suggesting myxoma. After 14 days from the onset of symptoms, the tumor was surgically resected, and a pathological diagnosis of myxoma was established.

We report a case of LELCB in a 43-year-old man. Ultrasonography and cystoscopy revealed two bladder tumors, one on the left side of the trigone and the other on the right side of the trigone. Transurethral resection of the bladder tumors was performed and pathological analysis revealed undifferentiated carcinoma. We therefore performed radical cystectomy and urinary diversion. Immunohistochemically the tumor cells were positive for cytokeratin, but negative for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNA in situ hybridization as found for previous cases of LELCB. The final pathological diagnosis was a lymphoepithelioma-like variant of urothelial carcinoma with perivesical soft tissue invasion. For adjuvant systemic chemotherapy, three courses of cisplatin were administered. The patient subsequently became free of cancer 72 months postoperatively. Based on the literature, pure or predominant LELCB types show favorable prognoses due to their sensitivity to chemotherapy or radiotherapy. An analysis of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of bladder tumors examined in our institution revealed that the ADC value measured for this LELCB was relatively low compared to conventional urothelial carcinomas.

The cells have acquired the surveillance system, known as the DNA damage responses, to maintain genomic integrity. The DNA damage responses play an important role in sensing DNA damage, transmitting the signals to downstream targets, and coordinating various cellular responses such as cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. Apoptosis is a highly regulated cell death process that controls cellular homeostasis and prevents survival of injured, damaged, or transformed cells. On the other hand, cellular senescence is not only a potent tumor-suppressive mechanism leading to permanent cell-cycle arrest but also is proposed to drive organismal aging. Recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate apoptosis and cellular senescence identified various key regulators. In this chapter, we will review the signaling networks underlying the induction of apoptosis and cellular senescence and their implications for cancer development and therapy. We will also discuss cellular senescence’s impact beyond the tumor-suppressive function, animal aging, and tissue homeostasis. ?

Intravenous injection of granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), a major cytokine in LAK-T sup, had a similar effect. Furthermore, LAK-T sup induced Ca++ increase in rat hippocampal brain slices that was detected in neuronal cells by emission of Fluo-8 NW at 520nm. The same effect was observed with an rGM-CSF solution. GM-CSF may activate neuronal cells by stimulating the glial cells that surround and attach to them.

It is biosynthesized within the body, and modulates many signal transduction processes. For investigation of the functions of this gaseous mediator, it is necessary to use chemical donors that release NO specifically, and it is highly advantageous if the release can be made with precise spatiotemporal control. For this purpose, we have developed caged NO (photocontrollable NO-releasing compounds) with unique releasing mechanisms. One employs the photoinduced rearrangement of an arylnitro group and subsequent release of NO, and another uses photoinduced electron transfer to release NO. One of our caged NO was confirmed to induce a NO-dependent cellular response in vivo under photocontrol. Photocontrollable NO releasers are expected to become indispensable tools for physiological experiments, and are also potential therapeutic agents for photodynamic therapy. ? 2016 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Caged compound; Controlled release; Nitric oxide; Reactive oxygen species,"gasotransmitter; nitric oxide; reactive oxygen metabolite; nitric oxide; cell function; controlled release formulation; electron transport; human; photodynamic therapy; Review; signal transduction; spatiotemporal analysis; abnormalities; animal; biosynthesis; brain; cell function; chemistry; congenital disorder; drug effects; ear; ectodermal dysplasia; Hirschsprung disease; intellectual impairment; kidney; metabolism; photochemistry; physiology; vasodilatation; X chromosome linked disorder; Animals; Brain; Cell Physiological Phenomena; Congenital Abnormalities; Ear; Ectodermal Dysplasia; Genetic Diseases, X-Linked; Hirschsprung Disease; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Kidney; Nitric Oxide; Photochemical Processes; Reactive Oxygen Species; Signal Transduction; Vasodilation",2-s2.0-84953377905

However, the prevalence of ERCP-related adverse events in patients with type 1 AIP has not been evaluated. We aimed to clarify the feasibility of ERCP in patients with type 1 AIP. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed 82 consecutive ERCP procedures performed in patients with type 1 AIP from 2004 to 2014 in one university hospital and three tertiary-care referral centers. One hundred four ERCP procedures in chronic pancreatitis and 1123 in non-AIP cohort were enrolled as control groups. We compared the incidence of post-ERCP pancreatitis (PEP) between type 1 AIP and control groups. We evaluated the incidence of ERCP-related adverse events and various predictive factors for hyper-amylasemia after ERCP. Results: Pancreatography and cholangiography by ERCP were obtained in 78 (95.1%) and 76 (92.7%) patients, respectively. The incidence of PEP, cholangitis, and bleeding was 1.2% (1/82), 0%, and 1.2%, respectively. PEP occurred in type 1 AIP patient with diffuse parenchymal imaging, and the severity was mild. The incidences of PEP were 2.9% (3/104) and 5.4% (61/1123) in chronic pancreatitis and normal cohort, respectively. The incidence of PEP was slightly lower in type 1 AIP than non-AIP cohort (1.2% vs 5.8%, p = 0.119). There were no significant predictive factors for hyperamylasemia after ERCP in type 1 AIP. Conclusions: The incidence of ERCP-related adverse events is low in patients with type 1 AIP. ERCP-related procedures are feasible in the diagnosis and treatment of AIP.

We examined whether an analysis of the ventricular repolarization instability could differentiate PVT/VF triggered by RVOT-PVCs from benign RVOT-PVCs or MVT. Methods We evaluated the ventricular repolarization instability as assessed by the beat-to-beat T-wave amplitude variability (TAV) using Holter recordings in patients with RVOT-PVCs but with no structural heart disease. We determined the prematurity index, defined as the ratio of the coupling interval of the first ventricular tachycardia (VT) beat or isolated PVC to the preceding R-R interval just before the VT or isolated PVC in the Holter recordings. The study patients were classified into RVOT-PVCs/MVT (n = 33) and PVT/VF (n = 10). Results The two groups did not differ with respect to the age, sex, and left ventricular ejection fraction. There was no significant difference in the prematurity index between the two groups (RVOT-PVCs/MVT 0.66 ± 0.16 vs. PVT/VF 0.61 ± 0.13, P = 0.60). The patients with PVT/VF had a significantly larger maximum TAV than those with RVOT-PVCs/MVT (31 ± 13 vs. 68 ± 40 μV, P < 0.001). Patients with a higher than median value of the TAV (33 μV) were at increased risk of PVT/VF vs. those with a lower than median value, after adjusting for the age and sex [9.25 (95% confidence interval: 1.27-19.2); P = 0.03]. Conclusions The TAV analysis is a useful measure to identify the subset of usually benign RVOT-PVC/MVT patients prone to PVT/VF. ? 2015 Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.",Arrhythmia; Catheter ablation; Holter electrocardiogram; Repolarization; Sudden cardiac death,"adult; age; Article; catheter ablation; clinical article; controlled study; female; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle outflow tract; heart rate turbulence; heart rate variability; heart repolarization; heart right ventricle outflow tract; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle tachycardia; Holter monitor; Holter monitoring; human; implantable cardioverter defibrillator; male; middle aged; monomorphic ventricular tachycardia; paroxysmal atrial fibrillation; polymorphic ventricular tachycardia; priority journal; prospective study; QRS interval; QT interval; risk assessment; RR interval; S wave amplitude; sex difference; T wave amplitude; ambulatory electrocardiography; complication; differential diagnosis; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; Ventricular Fibrillation; Ventricular Outflow Obstruction; Ventricular Premature Complexes; Diagnosis, Differential; Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Ventricular Fibrillation; Ventricular Outflow Obstruction; Ventricular Premature Complexes",2-s2.0-84962003899

PTHrP is a unique stretch-induced endogenous detrusor relaxant that functions via PTH1R. We hypothesized that suppression of this axis could be involved in the pathogenesis of bladder disease. Methods: PTH1R expression in clinical samples was examined by immunohistochemistry. Normal kidney tissue from a patient with renal cancer and bladder specimens from patients undergoing ureteral reimplantation for vesicoureteral reflux or partial cystectomy for urachal cyst were examined as normal control organs. These were compared with 13 diseased bladder specimens from patients undergoing bladder augmentation. The augmentation patients ranged from 8 to 31 years old (median 15 years), including 9 males and 4 females. Seven patients had spinal disorders, 3 had posterior urethral valves and 3 non-neurogenic neurogenic bladders (Hinman syndrome). Results: Renal tubules, detrusor muscle and blood vessels in normal control bladders stained positive for PTH1R. According to preoperative urodynamic studies of augmentation patients, the median percent bladder capacity compared with the age-standard was 43.6% (range 1.5-86.6%), median intravesical pressure at maximal capacity was 30 cmH2O (range 10-107 cmH2O), and median compliance was 3.93 ml/cmH2O (range 0.05-30.3 ml/cmH2O). Detrusor overactivity was observed in five cases (38.5%). All augmented bladders showed negative stainings in PTH1R expression in the detrusor tissue, but positive staining of blood vessels in majority of the cases. Conclusions: Downregulation of PTH1R may be involved in the pathogenesis of human end-stage bladder disease requiring augmentation. ? 2015 Nishikawa et al.; licensee BioMed Central.",Bladder compliance; Parathyroid hormone 1 receptor; Parathyroid hormone-related peptide; Smooth muscle,"parathyroid hormone; parathyroid hormone related protein receptor; parathyroid hormone related protein receptor 1; unclassified drug; parathyroid hormone; parathyroid hormone receptor 1; adolescent; adult; Article; bladder capacity; bladder compliance; bladder disease; child; clinical article; controlled study; detrusor muscle; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; male; molecular pathology; protein determination; protein expression; receptor down regulation; urodynamics; bladder; bladder disease; down regulation; metabolism; pathophysiology; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Down-Regulation; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Parathyroid Hormone; Receptor, Parathyroid Hormone, Type 1; Urinary Bladder; Urinary Bladder Diseases; Urodynamics; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84928683473

An intra-abdominal location of these lesions is rarer still and there are only a few reports describing laparoscopic resection for retroperitoneal lymphangiomas, especially in tumors that mimic pancreatic tumors. Case presentation: We present the case of an asymptomatic 30-year-old Japanese woman in whom a cystic tumor was found incidentally in close approximation to the pancreas. Because the tumor was located in the retroperitoneal space and the body of the pancreas was compressed, we were unable to distinguish a cystic lymphangioma from cystic pancreatic tumors. We started the procedure laparoscopically with five ports. The tumor was in fact separated from the pancreas and was dissected free from the body of the pancreas using scissors and laparoscopic coagulating shears. The left gastric vessels, which were compressed by the tumor, were preserved. As we realized that the tumor was connected to the retroperitoneal lymphatic tissue, we completed the procedure by performing a cystectomy without rupture. The specimen was extracted using a plastic bag. Our patient was discharged on postoperative day 7 without any complications. There is no evidence of recurrence during a >2-year observation period. Conclusions: In addition to the therapeutic significance in differentiating between a cystic lymphangioma in close approximation to the body of the pancreas and a pancreatic cystic neoplasm, the laparoscopic approach is feasible and effective. ? 2015 Sato et al.",Cystic lymphangioma; Laparoscopy; Retroperitoneum,"CD31 antigen; cytokeratin AE1; cytokeratin AE3; monoclonal antibody D2-40; adult; Article; case report; chronic cough; computer assisted tomography; cystectomy; cystic lymphangioma; differential diagnosis; endoscopic echography; endothelium; female; gastric artery; general anesthesia; histopathology; hospital discharge; human; human tissue; laparoscopy; lymph node dissection; lymphoid tissue; mucinous cystic neoplasm; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pancreas cyst; pancreas tumor; postoperative period; priority journal; retroperitoneal cyst; retroperitoneal cystic lymphangioma; tumor localization; chronic disease; complication; Cough; incidental finding; Japan; Lymphangioma, Cystic; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Retroperitoneal Neoplasms; treatment outcome; Adult; Chronic Disease; Cough; Female; Humans; Incidental Findings; Japan; Laparoscopy; Lymphangioma, Cystic; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Retroperitoneal Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84949544085

Patients were classified into 4 groups: NE, no enlargement; SE, superior enlargement; IE, inferior enlargement; and BE, both superior and inferior enlargement. In addition, pure-tone average (PTA) and speech discrimination score (SDS) were estimated before and after surgery to evaluate hearing. Results Hearing preservation (PTA ?50 dB; SDS ?50%) was seen in 96% (21/22), 100% (3/3), 50% (8/16), and 29% (2/7) in the NE, SE, IE, and BE groups, respectively. A significant difference in hearing preservation was seen between cases without IE (NE and SE) and cases with IE (IE and BE) (P < 0.0001). IE of the IAC was identified as an independent risk factor for hearing loss by logistic regression analysis (odds ratio, 32.0; 95% confidence interval, 4.2-783.6). Conclusions Enlargement of the IAC on coronal reconstruction computed tomography scan before surgery can predict hearing preservation using the MF approach. Patients without IE may represent good surgical candidates for the MF approach. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Hearing preservation; Internal auditory canal; Intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma; Middle fossa approach,"acoustic neurinoma; adult; aged; Article; brain surgery; cancer patient; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; confidence interval; controlled study; female; hearing; hearing impairment; human; image reconstruction; inner ear disease; internal auditory canal; internal auditory canal enlargement; intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma; logistic regression analysis; male; medical record review; middle aged; middle cranial fossa; middle fossa approach; neuroimaging; organ preservation; postoperative period; pure tone audiometry; risk factor; scoring system; skull surgery; speech discrimination; speech discrimination score; stereotactic radiosurgery; surgical approach; tumor volume; university hospital; auditory canal; computer assisted diagnosis; hearing; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Japan; Neuroma, Acoustic; neurosurgery; odds ratio; predictive value; procedures; radiography; retrospective study; statistical model; treatment outcome; Adult; Audiometry, Pure-Tone; Ear Canal; Female; Hearing; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Humans; Japan; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Neuroma, Acoustic; Neurosurgical Procedures; Odds Ratio; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84952638939

Methods: This study involved 106 consecutive inpatients aged 65 years or older, newly diagnosed with malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, just before chemotherapy initiation. The participants were administered the VES-13, and also underwent a comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA), including for depression and 6 other geriatric conditions, using validated measures, just before initiation of chemotherapy. We defined frailty as the presence of 2 or more geriatric conditions as determined by the CGA. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed. The 2-step screening approach was examined by post hoc analysis. Results: The average age of the subjects was 74 years. Among the 106 subjects, 50% met the criteria for frailty. Using a cutoff score of 2 to 3 on the VES-13, a sensitivity and negative predictive value (NPV) of 72% of the screening tool was obtained for the condition of frailty. When the second step of the screening, consisting of the VES-13 plus anhedonia, was applied to the VES-13-negative patients, the sensitivity and NPV improved to 90% and 88%, respectively. Conclusions: The 2-step approach exhibited better screening performance for frailty among patients with cancer than existing methods. Large prospective studies are required in the future to confirm this ability of the 2-step approach. ?

We examined possible associations between serum sex hormone level and polymorphisms in CYP19A1, HSD17B1, and HSD17B2. We also assessed possible interaction between these polymorphisms and current overweight. Methods We conducted a cross-sectional study. 785 Japanese natural postmenopausal women were randomly selected from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study database. Information on lifestyle factors was obtained from a self-administered questionnaire. Serum estrogens and androgens levels were measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Four tag SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) of CYP19A1, one missense SNP of HSD17B1 and three tag SNPs of HSD17B2 were examined by Invader assay. A trend test was conducted using linear regression. Results After adjustment for multiple comparisons, we found that rs4441215 and rs936306 in CYP19A1 and rs4888202 and rs2955160 in HSD17B2 were associated with differences in serum estrone level. Further, rs4441215 and rs936306 were associated with differences in serum estradiol level. None of these polymorphisms showed a significant interaction with current body mass index (BMI). Conclusions Our findings suggested that CYP19A1 and HSD17B2 polymorphisms might be associated with circulating sex hormone levels in Japanese postmenopausal women, independent of current BMI. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of the present study was to examine the session-by-session relationships between enthusiasm to complete the homework and the improvement of psychological distress in depressed people through the course of therapy. Methods: Working people with subthreshold depression were recruited to participate in the telephone CBT (tCBT) program with demonstrated effectiveness. Their enthusiasm for homework was enhanced with motivational interviewing techniques and was measured by asking two questions: ""How strongly do you feel you want to do this homework?"" and ""How confident do you feel you can actually accomplish this homework?"" at the end of each session. The outcome was the K6 score, which was administered at the start of each session. The K6 is an index of psychological distress including depression and anxiety. We used structural equation modeling (SEM) to elucidate the relationships between enthusiasm and the K6 scores from session to session. Results: The best fitting model suggested that, throughout the course of behavior therapy (BT), enthusiasm to complete the homework was negatively correlated with the K6 scores for the subsequent session, while the K6 score measured at the beginning of the session did not influence the enthusiasm to complete the homeworks assigned for that session. Conclusions: Empirical data now support the practitioners of BT when they try to enhance their patient's enthusiasm for homework regardless of the participant's distress, which then would lead to a reduction in distress in the subsequent week. ? 2015 Hayasaka et al.",Cognitive behavioral therapy; Depression; Enthusiasm; Homework; Structural equation modeling; Subthreshold depression; Telephone cognitive behavioral therapy,"adult; anxiety; Article; cognitive behavioral therapy; controlled study; depression; disease severity; distress syndrome; emotionality; female; homework enthusiasm; human; K6 score; major clinical study; male; motivational interviewing; outcome assessment; parental attitude; patient compliance; program effectiveness; randomized controlled trial; scoring system; structural equation modeling; telepsychiatry; teletherapy; therapy effect; achievement; anxiety disorder; cognitive therapy; Depressive Disorder; emotion; mental stress; middle aged; motivation; procedures; psychology; telephone; work; young adult; Achievement; Adult; Anxiety Disorders; Cognitive Therapy; Depressive Disorder; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Motivational Interviewing; Patient Compliance; Stress, Psychological; Telephone; Work; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84947976375

However, estimation of multiscale properties can be affected by the interpolation procedure used to preprocess the unevenly sampled R-R intervals derived from the ECG. To this extent, in this study we propose the estimation of wavelet coefficients and wavelet leaders on the output of inhomogeneous point process models of heartbeat dynamics. The RR interval series is modeled using probability density functions (pdfs) characterizing and predicting the time until the next heartbeat event occurs, as a linear function of the past history. Multiscale analysis is then applied to the pdfs' instantaneous first order moment. The proposed approach is tested on experimental data gathered from 57 congestive heart failure (CHF) patients by evaluating the recognition accuracy in predicting survivor and non-survivor patients, and by comparing performances from the informative point-process based interpolation and non-informative spline-based interpolation. Results demonstrate that multiscale analysis of point-process high-resolution representations achieves the highest prediction accuracy of 65.45%, proving our method as a promising tool to assess risk prediction in CHF patients. ? 2015 IEEE.",,"electrocardiography; heart contraction; heart failure; heart rate; human; mortality; pathophysiology; physiology; risk assessment; signal processing; survivor; wavelet analysis; Electrocardiography; Heart Failure; Heart Rate; Humans; Myocardial Contraction; Risk Assessment; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Survivors; Wavelet Analysis",2-s2.0-84953228722

SLC17A1, expressed in the liver and kidneys, harbours potent candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms that decrease uric acid levels. Therefore, we examined SLC17A1 polymorphisms (rs1165196, rs1179086, and rs3757131), which might suppress cardiovascular risk factors and that are involved in liver functioning, via a large-scale pooled analysis of the Japanese general population in a cross-sectional study. Using data from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study, we identified 1842 participants of both sexes, 35-69-years-old, having the requisite data, and analysed their SLC17A1 genotypes. In men, logistic regression analyses revealed that minor alleles in SLC17A1 polymorphisms (rs1165196 and rs3757131) were associated with a low-/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio >2.0 (rs1165196: odds ratio [OR], 0.703; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.536-0.922; rs3757131: OR, 0.658; 95% CI, 0.500-0.866), and with homocysteine levels of >10.0 nmol/mL (rs1165196: OR, 0.544; 95% CI, 0.374-0.792; rs3757131: OR, 0.509; 95% CI, 0.347-0.746). Therefore, these polymorphisms had dominant negative effects on cholesterol homeostasis and hyperhomocysteinaemia, in men, independent of alcohol consumption, physical activity, or daily energy and nutrition intake. Thus, genetic variants of SLC17A1 are potential biomarkers for altered cholesterol homeostasis and hyperhomocysteinaemia in Japanese men.",,"cholesterol; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; SLC17A1 protein, human; sodium phosphate cotransporter 1; adult; aged; Asian continental ancestry group; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; ethnology; female; gene frequency; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; homeostasis; human; hyperhomocysteinemia; Japan; male; metabolism; middle aged; risk factor; sex difference; single nucleotide polymorphism; statistical model; Adult; Aged; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cholesterol; Cholesterol, HDL; Cholesterol, LDL; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Homeostasis; Humans; Hyperhomocysteinemia; Japan; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Risk Factors; Sex Factors; Sodium-Phosphate Cotransporter Proteins, Type I",2-s2.0-84946600223

We investigated the prognostic significance of Trp catabolism in adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL).EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We quantified serum Trp and Kyn in 96 ATL patients, 38 human T-cell lymphotropic virus type-1 asymptomatic carriers (HTLV-1 ACs), and 40 healthy adult volunteers. The relationships between various clinical parameters were analyzed. IDO expression was evaluated in the affected lymph nodes of ATL patients.RESULTS: Serum Kyn concentrations and Kyn/Trp ratios were significantly higher in HTLV-1 ACs than in healthy controls. Both increased significantly with progression from HTLV-1 AC to ATL. There were no significant differences in serum Trp concentrations between ATL patients, HTLV-1 ACs and controls. IDO was possibly produced by ATL and/or cells in the microenvironment. Multivariate analyses demonstrated a high serum Kyn/Trp ratio and high Kyn level, but not a high Trp level, to be significant independent detrimental prognostic factors in ATL and aggressive variant ATL.CONCLUSIONS: Quantification of serum Kyn and Trp is prognostically useful for individual ATL patients. Furthermore, ATL is an appropriate disease for testing novel cancer immunotherapies targeting IDO.",,"tryptophan; aged; complication; female; human; Human T cell leukemia virus infection; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; male; metabolism; multivariate analysis; prognosis; virology; Aged; Female; HTLV-I Infections; Humans; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Male; Multivariate Analysis; Prognosis; Tryptophan",2-s2.0-84979792357

Adherence to treatment is an important factor for a good therapeutic outcome. Objectives: This study aimed to examine the adherence of patients with tinea pedis and to clarify the factors related to it. Materials and methods: We assessed medication adherence for oral and topical drugs using a translated version of the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale-8 (MMAS-8) together with other background factors in 445 Japanese patients with tinea pedis, using a questionnaire in a web-based monitoring system. Results: Overall, high, medium and low adherence rates as assessed by MMAS-8 were 8.7%, 31.7% and 59.6% for oral medication, and 8.6%, 17.4% and 74.0% for topical medication, respectively. The adherence level was significantly higher for oral medication than for topical medication. Subgroup analyses showed that the adherence level for topical medication was significantly higher when topical and oral medications were used in combination than when topical medication was used alone. A low adherence level was shown in employed patients, those for whom their oral medication had not been effective and those with topical medication who had visited their hospital less often than once every six months. Conclusion: Patient adherence to therapy can be effectively improved by selecting highly effective medication while considering the prescription of topical and oral antifungal medications concomitantly, by carefully selecting a therapy plan for employed patients and by encouraging patients to visit their doctor regularly. ? 2015, John Libbey Eurotext.

Despite these widespread adverse effects, cough research relies on animal models, which hampers our understanding of the fundamental cause of cough. Postnasal drip is speculated to be one of the most frequent causes of chronic cough; however, this is a matter of debate. Here we show that mechanical stimuli by postnasal drip cause chronic cough. We distinguished human cough from sneezes and expiration reflexes by airflow patterns. Cough and sneeze exhibited one-peak and two-peak patterns, respectively, in expiratory airflow, which were also confirmed by animal models of cough and sneeze. Transgenic mice with ciliary dyskinesia coughed substantially and showed postnasal drip in the pharynx; furthermore, their cough was completely inhibited by nasal airway blockade of postnasal drip. We successfully reproduced cough observed in these mice by injecting artificial postnasal drip in wild-type mice. These results demonstrated that mechanical stimulation by postnasal drip evoked cough.

When antigens are presented by APCs, including macrophages and DCs, T cells are activated and produce the Th1 cytokines IL-2 and IFN-γ. We have previously reported greater IL-12 production from macrophages infected with early-shared BCG sub-strains (ex. BCG-Japan, -Sweden) than from those infected with late-shared BCG (ex. BCG-Pasteur and -Connaught). In this study, we investigated the Th1 cytokine-inducing activity of splenocytes co-cultured with BCG-infected DCs. Early-shared BCG-infected DCs produced IL-12 and TNF-α. Furthermore, when they were co-cultured with purified protein derivative-stimulated DCs, the splenocytes of mice immunized with BCG-Tokyo/Japan produced more Th1 cytokine than did those of mice immunized with BCG-Connaught. In conclusion, early-shared BCG sub-strains more strongly induce Th1 cytokine production in vivo.

Computed tomography (CT)-guided marking with hook wires has been used to locate the nodules that are not identifiable under VATS. However, this method is invasive and is associated with a risk of complications. Methods: We evaluated the usefulness of marking the pleural surface above the nodule using crystal violet for 22 small-sized pulmonary nodules. Following the collapse of the lung, a long stick with a cotton tip dipped in crystal violet was inserted from the thoracic port or a small thoracotomy, and was placed against the inside of the chest wall right above the nodule with reference to the preoperative CT image. The lung was then expanded, and the crystal violet-infiltrated tip stained the visceral pleura. Regardless of the marking point, wedge resection of the lung was performed. To evaluate the accuracy of the marking, we measured the distance from the center of the marking to the point on the visceral pleural nearest to the nodule (DMN) in the resected lung specimen. Results: This marking method caused no morbidity during or after the operation. The DMN ranged between 0 and 50?mm (mean?±?SD 18.2?±?12.6?mm). In 18 of 22 cases (81.8?%), the DMN was 20?mm or less. Conclusions: The intraoperative marking method using crystal violet was performed with reasonable accuracy. It also caused no morbidity. It was easy and non-invasive. This method can be used in the cases in which CT-guided percutaneous marking is not feasible due to the nodule’s location. ? 2014, Springer Japan.",Co-morbidity; Lung cancer diagnosis; Lung cancer surgery,"crystal violet; coloring agent; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; female; human; lobectomy; long stick with a crystal violet infiltrated tip; lung nodule; lung resection; male; pleura; surgical equipment; surgical technique; wedge resection; adenocarcinoma; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; computer assisted tomography; evaluation study; Lung Neoplasms; middle aged; procedures; radiography; very elderly; video assisted thoracoscopic surgery; Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Coloring Agents; Female; Gentian Violet; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Pneumonectomy; Thoracic Surgery, Video-Assisted; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-84930868881

The trial has three steps and two randomizations. Step I randomization compares the minimum and the maximum dosing strategy for the first-line antidepressant. Step II randomization compares the continuation, augmentation or switching strategy for the second-line antidepressant treatment. Step III is a naturalistic continuation phase. The original protocol was published in 2011, and we hereby report its updated protocol including the statistical analysis plan. Results: We implemented two important changes to the original protocol. One is about the required sample size, reflecting the smaller number of dropouts than had been expected. Another is in the organization of the primary and secondary outcomes in order to make the report of the main trial results as pertinent and interpretable as possible for clinical practices. Due to the complexity of the trial, we plan to report the main results in two separate reports, and this updated protocol and the statistical analysis plan have laid out respective primary and secondary outcomes and their analyses. We will convene the blind interpretation committee before the randomization code is broken. Conclusion: This paper presents the updated protocol and the detailed statistical analysis plan for the SUN(^_^)D trial in order to avoid reporting bias and data-driven results.

Methods: Three committees (the professional committee for asking clinical questions (CQs) and statements by Japanese endoscopists, the expert panel committee for rating statements by the modified Delphi method, and the evaluating committee by moderators) were organized. Eight endoscopists and a surgeon for pancreatolithiasis made the CQs and statements from a total of 694 reports of published literature by PubMed search (from 1983 to 2012). The expert panelists individually rated these clinical statements using amodified Delphi approach, in which a clinical statement receiving amedian score greater than 7 on a 9-point scale from the panel was regarded as valid. Results: The professional committee made 3, 7, and 10 CQs and statements for the concept and pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment, respectively. The expert panelists regarded them as valid after a 2-round modified Delphi approach. Conclusions: After evaluation by the moderators, the Japanese clinical guidelines for pancreatolithiasis were established. Further discussions and studies for international guidelines are needed.

Therefore, advanced breast cancer patients experience much distress due to the decline of their health, ongoing medical treatments, uncertainty about their future, and many other problematic physical symptoms, as well as the difficulty in maintaining hope. In spite of these difficulties, little is known about how patients cope with the effects of advanced cancer. Furthermore, though advanced breast cancer has serious detrimental effects on the quality of life of patients, there is limited knowledge about which interventions help to cope with the disease. The aim of this study is to investigate (1) how patients cope with advanced breast cancer, (2) what is the associated factor for coping, (3) coping as a moderator and mediator, and (4) psychological intervention to assist advanced breast cancer patients to cope. ? 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Adjustment; Advanced breast cancer; Associated factors; Coping; Intervention,advanced cancer; breast cancer; Brief COPE; cancer patient; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale; coping behavior; Coping Strategy Questionnaire; cross-sectional study; depression assessment; distress syndrome; follow up; hopelessness; human; intervention study; Mental Adjustment of Cancer Scale; Mini-MAC; outcome assessment; patient care; posttraumatic stress disorder; problem solving; quality of life; questionnaire; Review; risk factor; Short Form 36; suicide; Ways of Coping Questionnaire; wellbeing,2-s2.0-84940438939

The international classification criteria (CC) for definite antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) recommend confirmation of the sustained presence, for at least 12 weeks, of both lupus anticoagulant (LA), as determined by aPTT and RVVT, and anti β2glycoprotein I (β2GPI) or anticardiolipin (aCL) IgG and/or IgM. However, it remains unclear whether obstetricians comply with the aforementioned CC for the diagnosis of APS in daily clinical practice. We performed a nationwide survey to examine the attitudes of Japanese obstetricians toward the use of assays for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs).Methods. A questionnaire was sent to 2,700 obstetric facilities where maternity checkups are carried out. The types of assays conducted for aPLs, ascertainment of persistence of the antibodies for at least 12 weeks, and the cutoff points used for the assays were examined.Results. Of the facilities surveyed, 61.5% carried out the assay(s) only once. In regard to the type of assay performed, 97.1% carried out the assay for aCL IgG and/or β2GPI-dependent aCL, while 67.9% performed the LA-aPTT and/or LA-RVVT assay. Only 8.8% carried out assays for both LA. As for the cutoff points used, 98% of the facilities used lower cutoff points described in the manufacturers manuals rather than the cutoff values recommended in the CC.Conclusion. Thus, only a limited number of facilities adhered precisely to the CC for the diagnosis of APS. Inappropriate treatment and unnecessary expense are potentially major concerns when facilities overdiagnose APS using lower cutoff points or without ascertaining the persistence of the antibodies for at least 12 weeks. On the other hand, some patients miss the opportunity to be treated for APS because of the absence of testing for LA. ? 2015 Japan College of Rheumatology.",Antiphospholipid antibody; lupus anticoagulant; obstetric antiphospholipid syndrome; recurrent pregnancy loss; survey,"antithrombin; beta2 glycoprotein 1 antibody; blood clotting factor 12; cardiolipin antibody; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; lupus anticoagulant; phosphatidylserine; phospholipid antibody; protein C; protein S; beta2 glycoprotein 1; cardiolipin antibody; lupus anticoagulant; phospholipid antibody; antiphospholipid syndrome; Article; disease classification; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; general hospital; health care facility; human; Japan; laboratory test; obstetrician; partial thromboplastin time; practice guideline; pregnancy disorder; priority journal; protocol compliance; questionnaire; thrombophilia; thrombosis; university hospital; adult; antiphospholipid syndrome; clinical practice; female; health care survey; immunology; male; middle aged; obstetrics; physical examination; practice guideline; pregnancy; protocol compliance; Adult; Antibodies, Anticardiolipin; Antibodies, Antiphospholipid; Antiphospholipid Syndrome; beta 2-Glycoprotein I; Female; Guideline Adherence; Health Care Surveys; Humans; Lupus Coagulation Inhibitor; Male; Middle Aged; Obstetrics; Physical Examination; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Pregnancy",2-s2.0-84946819261

The purpose of this study was to identify the frequency of decisionmaking incapacity among newly diagnosed older patients with hematological malignancy receiving first-line chemotherapy, to examine factors associated with incapacity and assess physicians' perceptions of patients' decision-making incapacity. Methods Consecutive patients aged 65 years or over with a primary diagnosis of malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma were recruited. Decision-making capacity was assessed using the Structured Interview for Competency and Incompetency Assessment Testing and Ranking Inventory-Revised (SICIATRI-R). Cognitive impairment, depressive condition and other possible associated factors were also evaluated. Results Among 139 eligible patients registered for this study, 114 completed the survey. Of these, 28 (25%, 95%confidence interval [CI]: 17%-32%) were judged as having some extent of decision-making incompetency according to SICIATRI-R. Higher levels of cognitive impairment and increasing age were significantly associated with decision-making incapacity. Physicians experienced difficulty performing competency assessment (Cohen's kappa-0.54). Conclusions Decision-making incapacity was found to be a common and under-recognized problem in older patients with cancer. Age and assessment of cognitive impairment may provide the opportunity to find patients that are at a high risk of showing decision-making incapacity.

Hence, we conducted detailed subset analysis of the prospective data. Methods: In this multicenter, prospective, comparative trial, a total of 70 patients with early, flat CRC were enrolled from February 2011 to December 2012, and the results of 66 lesions were finally analyzed. Patients were randomly allocated to primary MC followed by EUS or to primary EUS followed by MC. Diagnoses of invasion depth by each tool were divided into intramucosal to slight submucosal invasion (invasion depth &lt;1000 μm) and deep submucosal invasion (invasion depth ?1000 μm), and then compared with the final pathological diagnosis by an independent pathologist blinded to clinical data. To standardize diagnoses among examiners, this trial was started after achievement of a mean κ value of ?0.6 which was calculated from the average of κ values between each pair of participating endoscopists. Results: Both MC and EUS showed similar diagnostic outcomes, with no significant differences in prediction of invasion depth in subset analyses according to tumor size, location, and morphology. Lesions that were consistently diagnosed as Tis/T1-SMS or ?T1-SMD with both tools revealed accuracy of 76-78%. Accuracy was low in borderline lesions with irregular pit pattern in MC and distorted findings of the third layer in EUS (MC, 58.5%; EUS, 50.0%). Conclusions: MC and EUS showed the same limited accuracy for predicting invasion depth in all categories of early CRC. Since the irregular pit pattern in MC, distorted findings to the third layer in EUS and inconsistent diagnosis between both tools were associated with low accuracy, further refinements or even novel methods are still needed for such lesions. ? 2015 Yamada et al.

However, the role of TRB1 in the immune response is not understood. To evaluate this role, we examined regulation of TRB1 expression and the function of TRB1 in interleukin-2 (IL-2) induction in Jurkat cells, a human acute T cell leukemia cell line. We found that TRB1 was strongly induced by phorbol 12-my-ristate 13-acetate (PMA) and ionomycin in these cells. IL-2 expression was induced in Jurkat cells activated by PMA and ionomycin; however, knockdown of TRB1 resulted in decreased induction of IL-2. TRB1 null Jurkat cells established using the CRISPR/Cas9 system also showed reduction of IL-2 expression on PMA/ionomycin stimulation. TRB1 knockdown also markedly inhibited IL-2 promoter activation. To determine the mechanism of the stimulatory effect on IL-2 induction, we focused on histone deacetylases (HDACs), and found that HDAC1 preferentially interacts with TRB1. TRB1 suppressed the interaction of HDAC1 with nuclear factor of activated T cells 2 (NFAT2), which is a crucial transcription factor for IL-2 induction. These results indicate that TRB1 is a positive regulator of IL-2 induction in activated T cells. ? 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Histone deacetylase (HDAC); Interleukin-2 (IL-2); Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT); Tribbles 1 (TRB1),"histone deacetylase 1; interleukin 2; ionomycin; messenger RNA; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; regulator protein; transcription factor NFAT; transcription factor NFAT2; Tribble 1 protein; unclassified drug; calcium ionophore; carcinogen; HDAC1 protein, human; histone deacetylase 1; interleukin 2; ionomycin; NFATC1 protein, human; phorbol 13 acetate 12 myristate; protein serine threonine kinase; signal peptide; transcription factor NFAT; TRIB1 protein, human; Article; controlled study; gene expression; human; human cell; jurkat cell line; promoter region; protein protein interaction; T lymphocyte activation; transactivation; antagonists and inhibitors; lymphocyte activation; metabolism; physiology; T cell leukemia; T lymphocyte; Calcium Ionophores; Carcinogens; Histone Deacetylase 1; Humans; Interleukin-2; Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; Ionomycin; Jurkat Cells; Leukemia, T-Cell; Lymphocyte Activation; NFATC Transcription Factors; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; T-Lymphocytes; Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate",2-s2.0-84940918606

We developed an MCM assay method based on ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) that involves the determination of succinyl-CoA, which is formed in an enzyme reaction, using peripheral lymphocytes. Using 0.05, 0.5, and 5 μmol/L succinyl-CoA, the intra-assay coefficient of variation (CV) was less than 5.2 % and the inter-assay CV was less than 8.7 %. The MCM activities of five healthy individuals and four patients were investigated with this assay. The MCM activities of the patients were very low in relation to those of healthy individuals. Together, these results show that the UPLC-MS/MS method is useful for a detailed MCM activity assay. ? 2015 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Methylmalonic acidemia; Methylmalonyl-CoA; Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; Succinyl-CoA; Ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography,"Bioassay; Chromatography; Coenzymes; Diagnosis; High pressure liquid chromatography; Liquids; Mass spectrometry; Metabolism; Physiology; Spectrometry; Methylmalonic acidemia; Methylmalonyl-CoA; Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase; Succinyl-CoA; Ultra-high performance liquid chromatographies; Liquid chromatography; acyl coenzyme A; methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase; methylmalonyl-coenzyme A; succinyl-coenzyme A; adult; Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors; enzyme assay; enzymology; evaluation study; female; high performance liquid chromatography; human; male; metabolism; procedures; sensitivity and specificity; tandem mass spectrometry; young adult; Acyl Coenzyme A; Adult; Amino Acid Metabolism, Inborn Errors; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Enzyme Assays; Female; Humans; Male; Methylmalonyl-CoA Mutase; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tandem Mass Spectrometry; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84938093231

After the treatment of 9-EE-KODE in HRA cells, we found intracellular DNA fragmentation, surface-exposure of phosphatidylserine in the outer cell membrane, and increased caspase-3/7 activities in the HRA cells. The dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytosol, down-regulation of Bcl-2, and up-regulation of Bax levels were also found in 9-EE-KODE-treated cells in a dose-dependent manner.

The bipolar electrode is placed on the region while patients were awake; the patient should be in the same position and posture as during the surgery, with the neck skin stretched. A nerve course is confirmed by observing the movement of the lower lip. In this study, 5 upper-neck surgeries were conducted. Preoperative analysis revealed that 4 of the 5 cases had 2 branches of FNMB, and 1 with 3 branches. All FNMB immediately confirmed preoperatively were identified during surgery. We performed this method in much surgery including the surgery of the upper neck. It was easy to identify the facial nerve by this method and came to be able to do it precisely, and an operative time was shortened. We concluded that the preoperative FNMB identification using a nerve stimulator is most useful and benefit for upper-neck surgery patients and lead to avoid lower lip paralysis.

The blood sample was procured prior to treatment as well as 2-3 days and 1-3 weeks after the first dose of bortezomib, which was intravenously administered biweekly or weekly, during the first cycle. Six stimulant-mRNA combinations; that is, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), LPS-CXCL chemokine 10 (CXCL10), LPS-CCL chemokine 4 (CCL4), phytohemagglutinin-CCL4, zymosan A (ZA)-GMCSF and ZA-CCL4 showed significantly higher induction in the complete and very good partial response group than in the stable and progressive disease group, as determined by both parametric (t-test) and non-parametric (unpaired Mann-Whitney test) tests. Moreover, LPS-induced CXCL10 mRNA expression was significantly suppressed 2-3 days after the first dose of bortezomib in all patients, as determined by both parametric (t-test) and non-parametric (paired Wilcoxon test) tests, whereas the complete and very good partial response group showed sustained suppression 1-3 weeks after the first dose. Thus, pretreatment LPS-CXCL10 mRNA and/or the six combinations may serve as potential biomarkers for the response to bortezomib treatment in MM patients. ? 2015 Watanabe et al.

We then explored what factors may have affected risk communication. Methods We measured the implementation rate of the hepatitis virus-monitoring test among methotrexate (MTX)-treated patients; a warning letter had been issued regarding the use of MTX, as it apparently activates the hepatitis virus. Data from the NHICD, which include 99·3% of Japanese residents, were used. A total of 4 933 481 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (January-June, 2010) were the focus of this study. Results The implementation rate of the hepatitis virus-monitoring test increased from 1·4% before to 1·8% after the warning letter announcement. Logistic regression analysis suggested that the installation of a drug information management room is one of the important factors affecting risk communication. Further analysis revealed that the hepatitis virus monitoring rates in hospitals without drug information management rooms increased from 2·3% to 4·1% due to the issue of the warning letter. What is new and conclusion The warning letter from the regulatory agency plays an important role in risk communication in hospitals without drug information management rooms.

Most GPI-anchored proteins have been shown to be cleaved by GPI phospholipases. Recently, GPI-phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) was shown to be a strictly specific enzyme for GPI anchors. To investigate the involvement of GPI-PLD in the processes of neurodegeneration in prion diseases, we examined the mRNA and protein expression levels of GPI-PLD in the brains of a prion animal model (scrapie), and in both the brains and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) of sporadic and familial Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) patients. We found that compared with controls, the expression of GPI-PLD was dramatically down-regulated in the brains of scrapie-infected mice, especially in the caveolin-enriched membrane fractions. Interestingly, the observed decrease in GPI-PLD expression levels began at the same time that PrPSc began to accumulate in the infected brains and this decrease was also observed in both the brain and CSF of CJD patients; however, no differences in expression were observed in either the brains or CSF specimens from Alzheimer's disease patients. Taken together, these results suggest that the down-regulation of GPI-PLD protein may be involved in prion propagation in the brains of prion diseases. ? 2015 Jin et al.",,"glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D; glycosylphosphatidylinositol phospholipase D; phospholipase D; adult; aged; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; brain level; cerebrospinal fluid analysis; clinical article; controlled study; disease activity; disease association; down regulation; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; enzyme localization; familial Creutzfeldt Jakob disease; female; human; male; middle aged; molecular dynamics; molecular pathology; mouse; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; prion disease; protein expression; very elderly; animal; brain; C57BL mouse; cerebrospinal fluid; degenerative disease; enzymology; metabolism; pathology; prion disease; Animalia; Mus; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Animals; Brain; Female; Humans; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Middle Aged; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Phospholipase D; Prion Diseases",2-s2.0-84929483935

Our goal was to determine the most useful IHC method for the diagnosis of AIP.Methods: Specimens of AIP (18 patients), chronic pancreatitis (CP, 24 patients), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA, 45 patients) were evaluated with IHC for immunoglobulin G (IgG), IgG1, IgG4, and CD138 (syndecan-1). The number of IHC-positive cells was counted in 3, 5, and 10 different high-power fields (HPFs) by selecting fields with the most numerous positive cells (hotspot) or by randomly selecting fields in the affected areas (random). We evaluated the mean number of IgG4-positive plasma cells (IgG4+)/HPF (mean IgG4+), the number of fields with >10 and >50 IgG4+ (NOF >10 and NOF >50 IgG4+), the ratio of IgG4+/IgG+, IgG4+/IgG1+, and IgG4+/CD138+. Results: Analysis with receiver operator characteristic curves revealed that accurate and practical parameters in 3 HPFs were mean IgG4+ with the hotspot method (sensitivity, 88.9; specificity, 92.8?%), mean IgG4+ with the random method (100, 95.7?%), and NOF >10 IgG4+ with the random method (94.4, 97.1?%). These results were as accurate as results from 5 HPFs to 10 HPFs. The combination of mean IgG4+ and IgG4+/IgG+ did not provide more accurate diagnosis for AIP than a single criterion itself. Conclusions: Mean IgG4+ or NOF >10 IgG4+ with the random method in 3 HPFs was a useful and simple diagnostic method for AIP. The combined criteria of mean IgG4+ and IgG4+/IgG+ might not be required for accurate diagnosis of AIP. ? 2014, Springer Japan.",Autoimmune pancreatitis; IgG4-related disease; Immunohistochemical staining; Lymphoplasmacytic sclerosing pancreatitis,"biological marker; immunoglobulin G; adolescent; adult; aged; Autoimmune Diseases; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; comparative study; differential diagnosis; evaluation study; female; human; immunohistochemistry; immunology; male; metabolism; middle aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis, Chronic; plasma cell; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Autoimmune Diseases; Biomarkers; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Immunoglobulin G; Immunohistochemistry; Male; Middle Aged; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Pancreatitis, Chronic; Plasma Cells; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84939883288

Generally, this type of aneurysm is associated with various conditions such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and ICA dissection. Although Aspergillus is the most common organism causing intracranial fungal aneurysmal formation, there is no report of a blisterlike aneurysm caused by Aspergillus infection. Case Report: An 83-year-old man received corticosteroid pulse therapy followed by oral steroid therapy for an inflammatory pseudotumor of the clivus. Two months later, the patient was transported to an emergency department due to the diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage, classified as Fisher group 4. Subsequent 3D computed tomography angiogram revealed a blister-like aneurysm at the superior wall of the left ICA. Six days later, the patient died of subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by the left ICA aneurysm rerupture. Autopsy revealed proliferation of Aspergillus hyphae in the wall of the aneurysm. Notably, that change was present more densely in the inner membrane than in the outer one. Thus, it was considered that Aspergillus hyphae caused infectious aneurysm formation in the left ICA via hematogenous seeding rather than direct invasion. Conclusions: The blister-like aneurysm is a rare but important cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage. This case report documents another cause of blister-like aneurysms, that is an infectious aneurysm associated with Aspergillus infection. ?

The purpose of the present study was to present the treatment outcomes of particle therapy for indeterminate pulmonary nodules (IPNs) diagnosed as stage I non-small cell lung cancer, including a comparative analysis involving pathologically proven lung cancer (PPLC). Material and methods. A total of 54 patients (57 lesions) who underwent particle therapy for IPNs were enrolled in this study. Median patient age was 76 (range 52-87) years. T-classification was: T1a, 30; T1b, 16; and T2a, 11. Particle therapy using protons or carbon ions was delivered at total doses of 52.8-80 Gy equivalent in 4-26 fractions. The PPLC cohort included 111 patients. Results. The median follow-up time was 41 (range 7-90) months. For all IPN patients, the three-year overall survival, progression-free survival, local control and distant progression-free survival rates were 90%, 72%, 94% and 79%, respectively. Grade 2 toxicities were radiation pneumonitis (19%), dermatitis (9%), rib fracture (2%), chest wall pain (2%) and neuropathy (2%). No ? grade 3 toxicities were observed. In univariate analysis, the IPN group showed significantly better survival relative to the PPLC group. However, after adjustment for baseline imbalances between these two groups in multivariate analysis, pathological confirmation did not correlate with survival. Conclusions. Particle therapy for IPNs provided favorable outcomes with minimal toxicities, which may be comparable to those for PPLC patients. Further studies are needed to clarify the optimal management of IPN patients. ? 2014 Informa Healthcare.",,"adverse effects; aged; aged, 80 and over; analysis of variance; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Chest Pain; comparative study; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; injuries; Lung Neoplasms; Male; methods; Middle Aged; mortality; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; pathology; Positron-Emission Tomography; radiation effects; Radiation Pneumonitis; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Dosage; Retrospective Studies; Rib Fractures; Ribs; secondary; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Chest Pain; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiation Pneumonitis; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Dosage; Retrospective Studies; Rib Fractures; Ribs; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84924274986

Background: We previously reported a case of severe intracranial haemorrhage associated with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia due to anti-group A isoantibody. Material/Methods: A 40-year-old Japanese woman, gravida 4 para 1, was pregnant with her second baby. The previous sibling developed severe thrombocytopenia and died 10days after birth due to intracranial haemorrhage. He was diagnosed with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia; the causative antibody was found to be the anti-group A antibody. Prednisone was started at 7weeks' gestational age. Intravenous immunoglobulin 1gkg-1week-1 was started at 29weeks' gestational age and continued to delivery. Serological studies and genotyping were performed. Results: The second boy was delivered at 33weeks' gestational age by caesarean section. He was discharged without intracranial haemorrhage or thrombocytopenia. The anti-group A antibody titre in the maternal serum was 2048-4096 (normal range: 4-64). The anti-group A antibody titre in the newborn's serum was 4. Cross-matching between the maternal serum and the paternal platelets was positive.

Learning from HIV postexposure prophylaxis (PEP), we explored the possibility of using NAs in PEP following HBV exposure, if preexposure prophylaxis is feasible clinically. Using freshly isolated primary human hepatocytes cultured in vitro, we analyzed the effect of HBV-active tenofovir and lamivudine in primary HBV infection and also the effect of treatment with these NAs after HBV infection. HBV-active NAs applied from 24 h before inoculation could not prevent the secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen into the culture medium, and cessation of the NAs after inoculation allowed the cells to establish an apparent HBV infection. In contrast, hepatitis B immune globulin was able to prevent HBV infection completely. NA treatment before infection, however, can control the spread of HBV infection, as detected by immunohistochemistry. Practically, starting NA treatment within 2 days of primary HBV infection inhibited viral spread effectively, as well as preexposure treatment. We demonstrated that preexposure NA treatment was not able to prevent the acquisition of HBV infection but prevented viral spread by suppressing the production of mature progeny HBV virions. The effect of postexposure treatment within 2 days was similar to the effect of preexposure treatment, suggesting the possibility of HBV PEP using HBV-active NAs in HIV- and HBV-susceptible high-risk groups.

However, there is limited information on pemetrexed in a third-line setting. We report a case of metastatic UC treated with pemetrexed as third-line chemotherapy following gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) and gemcitabine and docetaxel (GD) therapies. A 73-year-old man with a history of transurethral resection of bladder carcinoma presented with pollakiuria. CT revealed a mass in the left renal pelvis that had invaded into the parenchyma of the left kidney, as well as para-aortic and mediastinum lymph node enlargement. Urinary cytology of the lesion in the left renal pelvis revealed UC. Thus, the patient was diagnosed with left renal pelvic carcinoma (cT3N2M0). After having received 4 courses of GC therapy, another mediastinum lymph node was enlarged. He subsequently received 3 courses of GD therapy as second-line chemotherapy, which showed little efficacy against the metastatic lesions. The patient was administered 3 courses of pemetrexed as third-line chemotherapy; however, its effect on tumor reduction was not sufficient. Finally, metastasis to the liver was observed, and he died 21 months after initiation of chemotherapy. For pathological confirmation, needle biopsy of a metastatic lymph node performed after death revealed high-grade UC and a high positivity of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in the tumor, which suggested that he could have benefited from anti-PD-L1 antibody immunotherapy.

Experience seeking medical institutions with Spanish language support in the Tokai area was set as the dependent variable and a chi-square test was conducted to examine relationships with language support needs, recognition of and access to medical institutions with Spanish language support, living situation in Japan, and Japanese language skills.RESULTS: Among the 245 respondents, 106 were male (43.3%) and 139 were female (56.7%). The average age was 39.6±11.2 years old and 84.5% were Peruvian. The average length of residency in Japan was 11.0±5.7 years, and 34.3% of respondents had lived in Aichi for 5-9 years. A total of 165 respondents (67.3%) had searched for medical institutions with Spanish language support, while 80 (32.7%) had not. Information-seeking behavior regarding medical institutions with Spanish language support was associated with having previously experienced a need for Spanish language support when seeing doctors in Japan, finding and attending medical institutions with Spanish language support in the Tokai area, length of residency in Japan, Japanese language skills, and the language used in daily life.CONCLUSION: Experience in requiring Spanish support when sick or injured in Japan motivated respondents to seek medical institutions with Spanish language support. Communication difficulties in Japanese, speaking Spanish in daily life, and length of residency in Japan were relevant factors in their information-seeking behaviors. Respondents were likely to obtain information from family, friends, co-workers, and Spanish media, but not from public institutions that distribute Spanish material. Finding an effective way to disseminate health-related information was a fundamental health issue for South American Spanish-speaking migrants.",,adult; communication disorder; ethnology; female; health care delivery; human; information seeking; Japan; male; middle aged; migration; psychology; South America; Adult; Communication Barriers; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Information Seeking Behavior; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; South America; Transients and Migrants,2-s2.0-84979821532

PAF-acetylhydrolase (PAF-AH) hydrolyzes the acetyl moiety of PAF at its sn-2 position and thereby inactivates it. PAF-AH Ib, originally identified in brain, exists in the cytoplasm of many (probably all) types of mammalian cells and tissues. PAF-AH Ib consists of three subunits (α1, α2, and β), in which the α subunits provide the catalytic activity. The finding that the β subunit is the product of the causative gene for Miller-Dieker lissencephaly led to extensive analyses of PAF-AH Ib subunits in the field of cell biology and neurobiology. More than 20 molecules are known to bind to PAF-AH Ib subunits, and PAF-AH Ib has been implicated in neuronal development, neuronal functions, Alzheimer's disease, bipolar disorder, cancer, spermatogenesis, and tolerance to hypoxia. However, in almost all of these cases, how the catalytic activity is involved and the identity of the most important substrate of this enzyme are unclear. In this chapter, the structure and functions of PAF-AH Ib and its subunit proteins are summarized and their contributions to human diseases are discussed. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",LIS1; Neuronal migration; PAF; PAF-acetylhydrolase; Spermatogenesis,,2-s2.0-84964995206

Forty-three patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma were treated with definitive radiotherapy with or without concurrent chemotherapy following induction chemotherapy. The predominant induction chemotherapy regimens involved cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil with or without docetaxel. The patients that responded to the induction chemotherapy received definitive organ-preserving treatment. Patients who did not respond to induction chemotherapy were considered for surgery, but only those patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy were analyzed in this study. Conventional radiotherapy was administered in all patients. The associations between clinical parameters including age, sex, performance status (PS), tumor site, T-category, N-category, stage, the regimen of induction chemotherapy, the response to induction chemotherapy, the presence/absence of concurrent chemotherapy, overall survival (OS), and local control (LC) were analyzed. Among the surviving patients, the follow-up period ranged from 10-145 months (median: 46 months). The 3-year OS and LC rates for all 43 patients were 61% and 70%, respectively. The 3-year OS and LC rates of the responders were 73% and 81%, respectively, whereas those of the non-responders were 29% and 40%, respectively. In multivariate analysis, only PS was correlated with overall survival (p=0.03). The complication rates were acceptable in all groups. Responders to induction chemotherapy appear to be good candidates for definitive organ-preserving treatment.

In general, rheumatologists or hematologists see APS thrombosis patients, and they often give advices for the treatments of APS-related pregnancy morbidities, such as measurements and interpretations of antiphospholipid antibodies(aPL). Objective: To survey the approaches of physicians in Japan to the diagnosis and treatment of aPL-associated pregnancy morbidities. Method: The study group on the Health and Labour Sciences Research Grants sent a questionnaire to 550 board members of the Japan College of Rheumatology and the Japanese Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis, and analyzed the responses. Result: The number of valid responses was 157 (28.5%). The number of pregnant women who were diagnosed as having APS was 118.7 patients/year in 53 of 157 hospitals (33.8%). With respect to aPL measurements, 128 out of 157 hospitals (81.5%) determined one or more anticardiolipin antibodies or β2GPI-dependent anticardiolipin antibodies with one or more lupus anticoagulants; however aPL tests of only 2 hospitals (1.3%) covered all aPLs defined in the classification criteria. The obstetricians were responsible for treatments in 33.1% to 42.3% of the hospitals. The treatment methods or duration of treatments did not reach to the general consensus. Conclusion: The number of cases of aPL-related pregnancy complications that physicians have intervened was relatively small. There are considerable patients that are not diagnosed as having the disease due to insufficient aPL examinations. There were less involvement of physicians to the diagnosis and treatment of pregnant women with aPLs. ? 2015 The Japan Society for Clinical Immunology.",Anti-beta2GPI antibodies; Anticardiolipin antibodies; Antiphospholipid antibodies; Antiphospholipid syndrome; Pregnancy morbidities,"acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; biological marker; heparin; phospholipid antibody; prednisolone; warfarin; antiphospholipid syndrome; blood; female; human; Japan; morbidity; pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; questionnaire; Antibodies, Antiphospholipid; Anticoagulants; Antiphospholipid Syndrome; Aspirin; Biomarkers; Female; Heparin; Humans; Japan; Morbidity; Prednisolone; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Surveys and Questionnaires; Warfarin",2-s2.0-84964433342

Mild systemic inflammation has been reported to increase an individual’s risk of AD. Inflammation has been thought to spread through the circulatory system and CNS. The increased amounts of inflammatory mediators in the blood are transmitted to the brain and may activate the microglia in the brain. Chronic inflammation in periodontal disease and periodontal disease-related bacteria are transmitted and spread to the brain via a certain mechanism, which might then exacerbate the AD. Periodontal infections are treatable, and thus this may be relevant for preventing and delaying the progression of AD.

Many clinical studies of cancer vaccines over the past 10 years have shown the augmentation of tumor immunity in some patients, although the clinical effects have been low. In addition, it was reported that blocking regulatory molecules involved in the immune checkpoint is important for immune activation in both in vitro and in vivo studies. In particular, studies using blocking antibodies to cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen (CTLA)-4, programmed cell death protein (PD)-1, or PD-1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) observed significant clinical effects including complete remission, suggesting that regulation of regulatory signals in the immune checkpoint is a new direction for the development of new drugs based on tumor immunity. As regulatory T cells (Tregs) also plays a key role in immune regulation, just as the regulatory molecules in the immune checkpoint become targets for the development of novel tumor immunotherapy, they may also become a target for development. Several reports have suggested that Tregs that infiltrate tumor sites as well as regulatory signals for immune checkpoints can inhibit tumor immunity, which is one explanation why treatment by cancer vaccine is limited. CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) is selectively expressed on effector Tregs, and humanized monoclonal antibodies to CCR4 have been developed as a drug, ‘mogamulizumab’, to treat adult T cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). Mogamulizumab depletes both ATLL cells and normal Tregs, resulting in the recovery of immune function in ATLL patients. Mogamulizumab is now expected to be accepted for use as a novel immuno-activator for tumor therapy by depletion of Tregs and is undergoing phase Ia/Ib studies for treatment of solid tumors in the lung, esophagus, intestine, ovary, and melanoma. ? 2015, Springer Japan.

As X-ray energies differ, we hypothesized that 18-MV photon IMRT may be better for large patients and tomotherapy may be more suitable for small patients. Thus, we compared dose-volume parameters for the planning target volume (PTV) and organs at risk (OARs) in 59 patients with T1-3 N0M0 prostate cancer who had been treated using 5-field IMRT. For these same patients, tomotherapy plans were also prepared for comparison. In addition, plans of 18 patients who were actually treated with tomotherapy were analyzed. The evaluated parameters were homogeneity indicies and a conformity index for the PTVs, and D2 (dose received by 2% of the PTV in Gy), D98, Dmean and V<inf>10-70</inf> Gy (%) for OARs. To evaluate differences by body size, patients with a known body mass index were grouped by that index ( <21; 21-25; and >25 kg/m2). For the PTV, all parameters were higher in the tomotherapy plans compared with the 5-field IMRT plans. For the rectum, V<inf>10 Gy</inf> and V<inf>60 Gy</inf> were higher, whereas V<inf>20 Gy</inf> and V<inf>30 Gy</inf> were lower in the tomotherapy plans. For the bladder, all parameters were higher in the tomotherapy plans. However, both plans were considered clinically acceptable. Similar trends were observed in 18 patients treated with tomotherapy. Obvious trends were not observed for body size. Tomotherapy provides equivalent dose distributions for PTVs and OARs compared with 18-MV 5-field IMRT. Tomotherapy could be used as a substitute for highenergy photon IMRT for prostate cancer regardless of body size. ?

Satisfactory outcome requires appropriate assessment of graft morphology. There are few analyses of the morphology of fibulae in reconstructed mandibles, although cadaver studies on fibular shape have been performed. Materials and Methods: In this study, we used postoperative computed tomography to retrospectively evaluate the shape, height, and orientation of fibulae transferred after mandibulectomy in 19 patients. Results: The average height of transferred fibulae was 14.3 mm (range, 10.8'20.5 mm). The crosssectional morphology of transferred fibulae could be classified into 2 types: apex and nonapex. The former type included knife-edged and triangular shapes; the latter included square and circular shapes. Conclusion: When implant insertion is planned in a reconstructed mandible, the orientation of the apex of transferred fibula should be evaluated preoperatively to allow for adjustments in implant procedure because the ridge at the apex of the fibula is narrow. ? 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the severity of radiation-induced oral mucositis and the myeloperoxidase (MPO) levels in irradiated tissues. Study Design Ninety-six F344 rats were divided into the following 4 groups: 10-Gy, 18-Gy, and 30-Gy irradiation groups, and a nonirradiation group. Oral mucositis was induced by the administration of single doses of radiation via exposure. After irradiation, the rats were evaluated on the basis of weight measurements, macroscopic findings according to a grading scale (Oral Mucositis Index [OMI]), and the results of tissue MPO assays. Results Weights decreased whereas the OMI scores and MPO levels increased, depending on the dose of exposure. The Spearman rank correlation test showed a significant correlation between the OMI scores and the MPO levels in the tissues with a correlation coefficient of 0.824 (P <.01).

Mean lung density (MLD) and the percentage of the lung field occupied by low attenuation area (LAA%) can be evaluated automatically, and their expiratory/inspiratory (E/I) ratios correlate with asthma severity and spirometry parameters. However, mosaic attenuation, another indicator of air trapping, has been assessed visually, and its functional relevance remains controversial. Objectives: This retrospective study was conducted to correlate mosaic attenuation, which was assessed visually and automatically, and the E/I ratios of MLD and LAA% (defined as areas <-960 Hounsfield units) with clinical and physiological variables, including impulse oscillometry (IOS) indices. Material and Methods: In 36 nonsmoking patients with stable asthma, the lungs were scanned at full inspiration and full expiration. Mosaic attenuation was measured visually and automatically, by counting areas with CT values higher than the surrounding areas. MLD and LAA% were measured using our validated method. Spirometry, IOS, exhaled NO and the sputum eosinophil count were evaluated. Results: The automatic results and visual scores of mosaic attenuation correlated well on expiratory scans (r = 0.894) and to a lesser degree on inspiratory scans (r = 0.629; p < 0.0001 for both). However, only the E/I ratios of MLD and LAA% correlated with forced expiratory volume in 1 s/forced vital capacity of spirometry and the IOS indices of resistance from 5 to 20 Hz and the integrated area of low-frequency reactance. Conclusions: Our automatic method for analysis of mosaic attenuation is likely useful, but the results themselves may not be reflecting small airway involvement of asthma, unlike the E/I ratios of MLD and LAA%. ? 2015 S.

In short-term observations, interferon (IFN) therapy has been shown to be effective in producing both biochemical and virological responses in children with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. However, in long-term follow up, no studies have shown a clear advantage of IFN therapy during childhood. We conducted a retrospective study on the sustained effect of IFN therapy among a Japanese pediatric population. Methods and subjects. A retrospective study was performed on 155 children with chronic HBV infection who were followed in two affiliated hospitals during the period from 1986 to 2013. Results. The 155 patients comprised 97 males and 58 female. Infection route was maternal transmission in 96/155 patients. HBV genotype was A in 17, B in 6, and C in 51 patients. IFN therapy was performed in 48 patients. One year after the completion of IFN therapy, normalization of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and lower viral levels (<104 copies/ml) was observed in 43 and 29 patients, respectively. The sustained effects of IFN therapy were evaluated by comparison between 43 hepatitis B e-antigen (HBeAg)-positive patients treated with IFN and 67 patients with chronic hepatitis B observed without IFN therapy. A Cox's proportional hazard analysis showed a higher seroconversion rate in the IFN group than in the untreated group (p = 0.003). Similarly, there were higher rates of ALT normalization and lower viral levels in the IFN group than in the untreated group (p = 0.001 for both). Conclusion. IFN therapy showed sustained effects for achieving ALT normalization and HBeAg seroconversion and for reducing the viral load in children with chronic hepatitis B. ?

Heart rate and blood pressure (BP) were also measured. The |d/a| ratio and BP were transiently, but significantly, elevated during SS and returned to baseline immediately after SS. Furthermore, we observed a significant correlation between the amount of change in the |d/a| ratio and the ankle range of motion during SS (r = 0.793 to 0.832, P = 0.01).

A collaborative investigation with industry in preclinical studies has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo e?cacy via ADCC for adult T-cell leukemia/lym- phoma (ATLL) and CCR4-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). In a phase I study, once-weekly administra- tion of mogamulizumab (0.01-1.0 mg/kg) for 4 weeks was well tolerated. In a phase II study of once-weekly mogamulizumab (1.0 mg/kg) for 8 weeks in relapsed/refractory ATLL patients, an overall response rate of 50％ in- cluding 30％ complete response rate with a median progression-free survival of 5.2 months was observed. The drug was subsequently approved by Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency(PMDA) in March 2012. Because CCR4 is abundantly expressed on the surface of e?ector regulatory T cells, a phase I study is being conducted to enhance an- titumor immune response in patients with solid tumors. However, approximately 60％ of patients receiving mogamulizumab experience skin eruption with 19％ showing grade 3 rash. Postmarketing surveillance of mogamulizumab revealed a 3-4％ incidence rate of skin-related serious adverse events (SAEs) such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). Therefore we initiated a search for predictive genomic biomar- kers in the blood of patients with ATLL or solid tumors prior to treatment with mogamulizumab for not only e?cacy but also immune-related SAEs. We believe the results of this study may lead to safer and more e?cient use of this agent in the near future. ? 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma; CC chemokine receptor 4; Genomic biomarker; Immune-related adverse event (irAE); Mogamulizumab,"biological marker; chemokine receptor CCR4; mogamulizumab; chemokine receptor CCR4; mogamulizumab; monoclonal antibody; pharmacological biomarker; antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity; Article; cancer therapy; disease surveillance; genomics; human; immune response; lymphoma; phase 1 clinical trial (topic); phase 2 clinical trial (topic); progression free survival; rash; regulatory T lymphocyte; solid tumor; Stevens Johnson syndrome; T cell leukemia; toxic epidermal necrolysis; treatment response; animal; blood; clinical trial (topic); Drug Eruptions; immunology; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral; mouse; personalized medicine; pharmacogenetics; postmarketing surveillance; Stevens-Johnson Syndrome; trends; Animals; Antibodies, Monoclonal, Humanized; Biomarkers, Pharmacological; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Eruptions; Genomics; Humans; Leukemia-Lymphoma, Adult T-Cell; Lymphoma, T-Cell, Peripheral; Mice; Pharmacogenetics; Precision Medicine; Product Surveillance, Postmarketing; Receptors, CCR4; Stevens-Johnson Syndrome",2-s2.0-84928956024

Thus biomarkers might be a useful tool to facilitate NDD because they can be used to evaluate accurately drug responses. Biomarkers include proteins, metabolites, and genetic targets; imaging data and can also be used in pre-clini- cal studies, clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance. In pre-clinical studies, biomarkers are used as an index of the pharmacological and toxicological e?ects of a new drug, which may help to predict the clinical response. In clinical stu- dies, biomarkers are widely used as an index of clinical e?cacy and safety for dose-adjustment and for patient selection. In post-clinical studies, biomarkers may facilitate the evaluation of drug responses, as well as aid improvements in drug e?cacy. Several points should be considered for biomarker-guided NDD. First, the clinical study design is very im- portant and must be suitable to permit the use of the relevant biomarkers. The analytical methods should be carefully evaluated, and evidence should be provided regarding the physiological signi?cance and relevance of the biomarker with regard to its intended use. Regulatory sciences are required to resolve these issues and bridge the gap between basic science and clinical studies that involve biomarkers. ? 2015 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Biomarker; Clinical study design; E?cacy and safety; New drug development,"biological marker; pharmacological biomarker; Article; clinical study; drug activity; drug approval; drug design; drug efficacy; drug safety; new drug development; clinical trial (topic); drug development; human; methodology; therapeutic equivalence; Biomarkers, Pharmacological; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug Discovery; Humans; Research Design; Therapeutic Equivalency",2-s2.0-84928954629

Noninvasive IPMNs possessed non-neoplastic and noninvasive spots in their tissues, and invasive IPMN cases possessed non-neoplastic, noninvasive, and invasive spots. Non-neoplastic (n=28), noninvasive (n=28), and invasive (n=11) spots were then analyzed for aneuploidy of chromosomes 3, 6, 7, 8, 17, and 18 and deletions of p16 and p53 loci.

In total, 35 (76%) patients were able to continue the treatment until the end of the observation period, including 32 (69%) who succumbed to the disease and three (7%) who were transferred from Nagoya City University Hospital to a hospice. Of the 11 (24%) discontinued cases, six were changed to a course of injectable opioids for the palliation of terminal symptoms, including dyspnea. Adverse effects were observed in 11 (24%) cases, but discontinuation due to adverse effects occurred in only four cases. Therefore, the present study indicates that palliative treatment with the once?a?day fentanyl citrate transdermal patch is well?tolerated by lung cancer patients. ? 2015, Spandidos Publications.

Abstinence from oral feeding is necessary to prevent respiratory complications including pneumonia. Surgery is sometimes necessary to maintain quality of life. The aim of this study was to examine clinical outcomes of esophageal cancer complicated by tracheobronchial fistula. Presentation of case Twelve patients who underwent esophageal bypass between 2006 and 2011 in our hospital were studied. Patient characteristics, therapeutic course, outcome, and operation type were compared. Six patients among 8 who could not tolerate oral feeding could do so after bypass surgery. Ten patients were able to enjoy oral intake up until the last few days of life. Three patients survived for more than 10 months. In spite of undergoing an operation, 1 patient survived for only 2 months and another for 4 months. The only complication was postoperative delirium in 1 patient. Discussion While surgical bypass is more invasive than procedures such as endoscopic stenting, we had few complications after operative intervention and were able to maintain quality of life in our patients. Conclusion This bypass procedure is a treatment option for patients with tracheobronchial fistula from advanced esophageal cancer. ? 2015 Z.Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Bronchoesophageal fistula; Bypass surgery; Esophageal cancer,cisplatin; fluorouracil; adult; advanced cancer; aged; anastomosis leakage; Article; assessment of humans; bronchoscopy; bypass surgery; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer combination chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer mortality; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; cancer survival; cause of death; chemoradiotherapy; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; dysphagia; esophageal bypass surgery; esophagobronchial fistula; esophagography; esophagoscopy; esophagus cancer; esophagus stenosis; esophagus surgery; feeding; female; fever; hemoptysis; human; male; multimodality cancer therapy; nutritional deficiency; operation duration; operative blood loss; pneumonia; postoperative complication; postoperative delirium; priority journal; prognostic nutritional index; quality of life; stapler; thoracotomy,2-s2.0-84924292474

Many virulence-associated proteins play important roles in its pathogenesis and the production of these proteins is controlled by many regulatory factors. CovS is one of the most important two-component sensor proteins in S. pyogenes, and it has been analyzed extensively. Our recent analyses revealed the existence of a transposon between covS and nrdR in several strains, and we speculated that this insertion has some importance. Hence, we examined the significances of the NrdR stand-alone regulator and DnaB, which is encoded by the gene located immediately downstream of nrdR in S. pyogenes infection. We established an nrdR-only knockout strain, and both nrdR and partial dnaB knockout strain. These established knockout strains exhibited a deteriorated response to H2O2 exposure. nrdR and partial dnaB knockout strain was more easily killed by human polynuclear blood cells, but the nrdR-only knockout strain had no significant difference compared to wild type in contrast to the combined knockout strain. In addition, the mouse infection model experiment illustrated that nrdR and partial dnaB knockout strain, but not the nrdR-only knockout strain, was less virulent compared with the parental strain. These results suggest that DnaB is involved in response to host defense. ? 2014 APMIS.",DnaB; Host defense; NrdR; Streptococcus pyogenes,"bacterial protein; DnaB helicase; hydrogen peroxide; NrdR protein; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; DnaB helicase; hydrogen peroxide; virulence factor; animal experiment; animal model; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; carboxy terminal sequence; controlled study; female; gene expression; growth inhibition; host resistance; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; knockout gene; leukocyte function; mouse; nonhuman; phagocyte; priority journal; Streptococcus pyogenes; toxic shock syndrome; amino acid sequence; animal; communicable disease; disease model; drug effects; gene expression regulation; gene inactivation; genetics; immunology; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; isolation and purification; leukocyte; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; oxidative stress; pathology; serum bactericidal activity; Streptococcus infection; Streptococcus pyogenes; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Blood Bactericidal Activity; Communicable Diseases, Emerging; Disease Models, Animal; DnaB Helicases; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Knockout Techniques; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Leukocytes; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxidative Stress; Streptococcal Infections; Streptococcus pyogenes; Virulence Factors",2-s2.0-84923496524

In the present study, we investigated the feasibility of establishing an orthotopic model using the 3 rat prostate cancer cell lines in immunocompetent rats with the aim of resolving species-mismatch problems and defects of immune systems. The PLS10, PLS20 and PLS30 cell lines were injected into the ventral prostates of 6-weekold rats, which were then sacrificed at experimental weeks 4 and 8. Tumor mass formation was found in rats with PLS10, but not in those with PLS20 or PLS30. Additionally, metastatic carcinomas could be detected in lymph nodes and lungs of PLS10-inoculated rats. Genetic analysis demonstrated K-ras gene mutations in PLS10 and PLS20, but not in PLS30 cells. There were no mutations in p53 and KLF6. In conclusion, we established a syngeneic orthotopic model for prostate cancer in immunocompetent rats simulating human castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), which should prove useful for development and validation of therapeutic agents, especially with immunotherapy. ? 2015 The Japanese Society of Toxicologic Pathology.",Immunocompetent animal; Orthotopic model; Prostate cancer; Rats,kruppel like factor 6; protein p53; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer graft; cancer immunotherapy; cancer model; castration resistant prostate cancer; controlled study; Fischer 344 rat; gene mutation; immune system; immunocompetence; lymph node metastasis; male; metastasis; nonhuman; nude mouse; prostate cancer; prostate cancer cell line; rat; tumor cell inoculation,2-s2.0-84923368212

To evaluate the dynamic state of water displacement during the cardiac cycle in idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH), we determined the change in water displacement using q-space analysis of diffusion magnetic resonance image. ECG-triggered single-shot diffusion echo planar imaging was used. Water displacement was obtained from the displacement probability profile calculated by Fourier transform of the signal decay fitted as a function of the reciprocal spatial vector q. Then maximum minus minimum displacement (delta-displacement), of all cardiac phase images was calculated. We assessed the delta-displacement in white matter in patients with iNPH and atrophic ventricular dilation (atrophic VD), and in healthy volunteers (control group). Delta-displacement in iNPH was significantly higher than those in the atrophic VD and control. This shows that water molecules of the white matter in iNPH are easily fluctuated by volume loading of the cranium during the cardiac cycle, due to the decrease in intracranial compliance. There was no significant correlation between delta-displacement and displacement. The delta-displacement and the displacement do not necessarily yield the same kind of information. Delta-displacement demonstrated to obtain biophysical information about fluctuation. This analysis may be helpful in the understanding physiology and pathological condition in iNPH and the assisting in the diagnosis. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Diffusion weighted imaging; Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus; Magnetic resonance imaging; Q-space,"Diagnosis; Diffusion; Magnetic resonance imaging; Molecules; Biophysical information; Diffusion weighted imaging; Displacement probability; Echo planar imaging; Molecular displacements; Normal pressure hydrocephalus; Pathological conditions; Q-Space; Heart; aged; Article; artifact; brain ventricle dilatation; brain water; clinical article; compliance (physical); controlled study; diffusion coefficient; diffusion weighted imaging; echo planar imaging; electrocardiogram; female; Fourier transformation; heart cycle; human; male; measurement accuracy; molecular dynamics; neuroimaging; normotensive hydrocephalus; predictive value; priority journal; probability; signal detection; signal noise ratio; white matter; body water; brain; cardiac gated imaging; computer assisted diagnosis; Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure; image enhancement; metabolism; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; biological marker; Aged; Biological Markers; Body Water; Brain; Cardiac-Gated Imaging Techniques; Echo-Planar Imaging; Female; Humans; Hydrocephalus, Normal Pressure; Image Enhancement; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Male; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; White Matter",2-s2.0-84923105429

The patient had progressive vision loss over 6 months preoperatively; best corrected visual acuity and high-definition optical coherence tomography changes improved postoperatively. Optic disc pit-like maculopathy can occur in patients with normal-tension glaucoma in the absence of obvious congenital anomalies of the disc. The intraretinal fluid might have migrated from the vitreous cavity through a microhole at the optic disc margin or in the area with the nerve fiber defect.

However, the relationship between depression and the development of arteriosclerosis has not been fully established. We assessed depression and brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) in 828 middle-aged Japanese male subjects at baseline and during 3 years of follow-up. Depression was assessed using Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression questionnaires, and the study subjects were divided into the following three groups: persistent depression, transient depression and no depression. The number (%) of subjects with persistent, transient and no depression were 104 (12.6), 76 (9.2) and 648 (78.2), respectively. Blood pressure and baPWV did not differ among the three groups at baseline. The changes in the baPWV values (baPWV) correlated significantly and positively with age, body mass index, baseline systolic blood pressure and persistent depression (r=0.32, P<0.01). After 3 years of follow-up, the baPWV was significantly greater in subjects with persistent depression compared with those with no depression (36±28 vs. 18±10 cm s-1, P=0.02). After adjustment for conventional risk factors, persistent depression was significantly associated with baPWV by multiple regression analysis (β=0.261, P<0.01).

We reported that deficiency of the eNOS protein exacerbates colitis induced by dextran sodium sulfate (DSS-induced colitis). However, the role of eNOS in colitis remains controversial. Therefore, we studied how over-expression of eNOS aff ected this infl ammatory condition, using vascular endothelial cells and mice as in vitro and in vivo models, respectively . Furthermore, we investigated the infl uence of a polymorphism in the eNOS gene on the clinical features of ulcerative colitis (UC). Methods . We examined the eff ect of eNOS overexpression on the expression of adhesion molecules in the endothelium and assessed the degree of DSS-induced colitis in e NOS transgenic (eNOS-Tg) mice. We also investigated the relationship between a polymorphism in the e NOS gene and clinical features of patients with UC. Results . The expression of adhesion molecules, under infl ammatory conditions, was attenuated in e NOS gene-transfected vascular endothelial cells, as measured by western blot analysis. Symptoms of DSS-induced colitis were likewise attenuated in eNOS-Tg mice, which exhibited lower weight loss, mortality, histological damage (by infl ammation score and crypt damage score), and colonic myeloperoxidase activity, tumor necrosis factor-±expression, and MAdCAM-1 expression than in wild-type mice. Furthermore, there was a signifi cant relationship between intractable cases of UC and a polymorphism in the eNOS gene promoter (c.-786 T >C) that decreases eNOS expression. Conclusion .

In 2010, an endoscopic examination revealed a depressed-type lesion at the oral side of the anastomosis, which was diagnosed as signet-ring adenocarcinoma. Surgical management was considered, but was rejected because of obstructive and restrictive respiratory events. Chemotherapy was terminated because of adverse events. Endoscopy was used to administer intratumoral injections of dendritic cells (DCs) targeting synthesized peptides of Wilms tumor 1 (WT1) and mucin 1, cell-surface associated (MUC1). An immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor samples indicated positivity for WT1 and MUC1. One month after seven cycles of DC had been administered (between November 2010 and April 2011), no suspicious lesions were evident, and his biopsy results were normal.

We have established transgenic rats carrying a mutated K-ras gene controlled by Cre/loxP activation. The animals develop PDA which is histopathologically similar to that in humans. Previously, we reported that serum levels of N-ERC/mesothelin were significantly higher in rats bearing PDA than in controls. In the present study, to determine whether serum levels of N-ERC/mesothelin correlated with tumor size, we measured N-ERC/mesothelin levels in rats bearing PDA. Increased serum levels of N-ERC/mesothelin correlated with increased tumor size. This result indicates an interrelationship between the serum level of N-ERC/mesothelin and tumor size. We next investigated the effect of chemotherapy on serum N-ERC/mesothelin levels. Rat pancreatic cancer cells were implanted subcutaneously into the flank of NOD-SCID mice. In the mice treated with 200 mg/kg gemcitabine, tumor weight and the serum level of N-ERC/mesothelin were significantly decreased compared to controls.

Among the several treatable risk factors of CKD, that of dyslipidemia is relatively controversial. To clarify the association of polymorphisms in genes involved in lipid metabolism with the risk of CKD in the Japanese population, we used cross-sectional data from the Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort (J-MICC) Study. Methods: A total of 3,268 men and women, aged 35-69 years, were selected from J-MICC Study participants for inclusion in this study. Twenty-eight candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected in 17 genes associated with the risk of lipid metabolism disorders, and genotyping of the subjects was conducted using the multiplex PCR-based invader assay. The prevalence of CKD was determined for stages 3-5 (defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;60 ml/min/1.73 m2). Results: Logistic regression analysis revealed that SNPs APOA5 T - 1131C (rs662799), APOA5 T1259C (rs2266788), TOMM40 A/G (rs157580), and CETP TaqIB (rs708272) were significantly associated with CKD risk in those individuals genotyped, with age- and sex-adjusted odds ratios (ORs) per minor allele (and 95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of OR 1.22 (95% CI: 1.06-1.39), 1.19 (1.03-1.37), 1.27 (1.12-1.45), and 0.81 (0.71-0.92), respectively. Analysis of the gene-environment interaction revealed that body mass index (BMI) was a significant effect modifier for APOA5 T - 1131C (rs662799) and a marginally significant effect modifier for APOA5 T/C (rs2266788), with the interaction between BMI ?30 and individuals with at least one minor allele of each genotype of OR 10.43 (95% CI: 1.29-84.19) and 3.36 (0.87-13.01), respectively. Conclusions: Four polymorphisms in APOA5, TOMM40, and CETP were shown to be significantly associated with CKD risk, and a significant interaction between the two APOA5 SNPs and BMI on CKD risk was also demonstrated. This suggests the future possibility of personalized risk estimation for this life-limiting disease. ? 2014 Hishida et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Chronic kidney disease; Lipid metabolism; Single nucleotide polymorphism,"adult; aged; APOA5 gene; Article; body mass; CETP gene; chronic kidney disease; controlled study; cross-sectional study; disorders of lipid metabolism; female; gene; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic risk; genotype; genotype environment interaction; glomerulus filtration rate; human; Japanese (people); major clinical study; male; multiplex polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; single nucleotide polymorphism; TOMM40 gene; chronic kidney failure; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic predisposition; genetics; Japan; lipid metabolism; middle aged; pathophysiology; risk factor; APOA5 protein, human; apolipoprotein A; Adult; Aged; Apolipoproteins A; Body Mass Index; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Gene Frequency; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Japan; Linkage Disequilibrium; Lipid Metabolism; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-84925884248

Recently, a novel protein kinase that regulates estrogen receptor alpha activity, lemur tyrosine kinase-3, has been identified. In this study, we investigated whether messenger RNA expression and polymorphisms of the gene encoding the kinase, LMTK3, are associated with prognosis in breast cancer patients during long-term follow-up.METHODS: First, we investigated the relationship between messenger RNA expression of LMTK3 and patient outcome in 219 breast cancers. The effects of several variables on survival were tested by Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. Next, we performed LMTK3 genotyping in 471 breast cancers to clarify the prognostic role of these polymorphisms.RESULTS: Our data showed that LMTK3 expression level was not associated with prognosis in all patients. We then analyzed the impact of LMTK3 mRNA expression on the prognosis of breast cancer according to estrogen receptor alpha status. Both disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly shorter in estrogen receptor alpha-positive patients with high LMTK3 expression receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy than in those patients with low LMTK3 expression. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that high LMTK3 expression was an independent poor prognostic factor in estrogen receptor alpha-positive breast cancer patients. We did not find any correlation between LMTK3 genotypes and prognosis of breast cancer patients in our series.CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that high expression of LMTK3 is an independent prognostic factor in estrogen receptor alpha-positive breast cancer patients receiving adjuvant endocrine therapy. ?

Methods: IL28B genotype and mutations in the core of hepatitis C virus (HCV) were analyzed in 30 patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV for HCV infection. The initial rate of decrease in the viral load was assessed during the first 2 weeks of treatment. Results: IL28B major allele was seen more frequently in patients with sustained virologic response (SVR) than in non-SVR patients (P<0.001). There was no difference between these two groups in frequency of Core 70 mutation. Among patients with genotype-1, SVR was achieved in more patients (P=0.007) in the IL28B major allele group than in those in the minor allele group. The early decrements in the viral load (log/2 weeks) were 3.80±0.86 in the genotype-2 major allele group, 1.82±0.84 in the genotype-1 major allele group, and 0.41±0.33 in the genotype-1 minor allele group. Conclusions: Among pediatric patients with HCV infection the effectiveness of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy may be lower in the group with genotype-1 IL28B minor alleles than in other groups with IL28B major allele.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey using a self-report questionnaire was performed evaluating interpersonal violence perpetration, violence toward objects, the number of diets, BMI, BWP, the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), victimization, substance use, and other psychosocial variables among 9,112 Japanese females aged between 12-18 years. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to analyze the contribution of BMI, BWP, and weight-control behavior to the incidence of violent behavior, while controlling for potential confounding factors. Results: The number of diets was associated with both interpersonal violence perpetration (OR = 1.18, 95% CI 1.08-1.29, p,< 0.001) and violence toward objects (OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.24-1.45, p, <0.001), after adjusting for age, BMI, BWP, the GHQ-12 total score, victimization, and substance use. In terms of BMI and BWP, the ''overweight'' BWP was associated with violence toward objects (OR = 1.29, 95% CI 1.07-1.54, p<0.05). On the other hand, the ''Underweight'' and ''Slightly underweight'' BMI were related to violence toward objects [(OR = 1.28, 95% CI 1.01-1.62, p,<0.05) and (OR = 1.27, 95% CI 1.07-1.51, p,< 0.05), respectively]. The ''Underweight'' BWP was related to interpersonal violence perpetration (OR = 2.30, 95% CI 1.38-3.84, p<0.05).

Family psychoeducation is recognized as part of the optimal treatment for patients with psychotic disorder. A previous randomized controlled trial has found that family psychoeducation is effective in enhancing the treatment of MDD. Although MDD can easily become a chronic illness, there has been no intervention study on the families of patients with chronic depression. In the present study, we design a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of family psychoeducation in improving the mental health of relatives of patients with MDD lasting more than one year. Methods/Design: Participants are patients with MDD lasting more than one year and their relatives. Individually randomized, parallel-group trial design will be employed. Participants will be allocated to one of two treatment conditions: relatives will receive (a) family psychoeducation (four, two-hour biweekly multifamily psychoeducation sessions) plus treatment-as-usual for the patient (consultation by physicians), or (b) counseling for the family (one counseling session from a nurse) plus treatment-as-usual for the patient. The primary outcome measure will be relatives' mental health as measured by K6 that was developed to screen for DSM-IV depressive and anxiety disorder. Additionally, the severity of depressive symptoms in patients measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scale will be assessed. Data from the intention-to-treat sample will be analyzed 16weeks after randomization. Discussion: This is the first study to evaluate the effectiveness of family psychoeducation for relatives of patients with MDD lasting more than one year. If this type of intervention is effective, it could be a new method of rehabilitation for patients with MDD lasting more than one year. ? 2014 Katsuki et al.",Family psychoeducation; Major depressive disorder; Randomized controlled trial,"adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; Beck Depression Inventory; Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale; clinical article; clinical protocol; consultation; controlled study; disease severity; DSM-IV; family counseling; family psychoeducation; female; health care quality; human; intention to treat analysis; Japanese version of the Family Assessment Device; Japanese version of the Family Attitude Scale; Japanese version of the Zarit Burden Interview; Japanese version of the Zarit Burden Interview short version 8; K6 score; major depression; male; mental health; multifamily psychoeducaton; outcome assessment; psychoeducation; psychometry; randomized controlled trial; relative; sample size; Short Form 36; symptomatology; training; treatment duration; very elderly; clinical protocol; family; major depression; patient education; psychology; Clinical Protocols; Depressive Disorder, Major; Family; Humans; Mental Health; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient Education as Topic",2-s2.0-84934279860

However, administration of this drug has procedural difficulties and a risk of sepsis. Oral drugs provide simple treatment, but their benefit for survival has not been proven. A recovery of patients with PAH to World Health Organization functional class (WHO-FC) I or II may predict favorable survival. Methods. Survival analyses were performed on a historical cohort of 41 patients with PAH. The patients were 43 ± 22 years old, 23 had idiopathic or heritable PAH, and 18 had connective tissue disease-associated PAH. The baseline was defined as the initial visit to a medical facility. Results: The median duration of follow-up was 1276 days (108 to 5389 days) and 21 patients died during this period. The estimated survival times for patients who received intravenous epoprostenol and did and did not recover to WHO-FC I or II were 4371 ± 577 days and 1172 ± 404 days, respectively. These times for patients who were not treated with intravenous epoprostenol and did and did not recover to WHO-FC I or II were 4717 ± 554 days and 925 ± 230 days, respectively. A Cox proportional hazard analysis gave a hazard ratio for death after recovery to WHO-FC I or II of 0.07 (P < 0.001). In contrast, use of intravenous epoprostenol was not a significant factor affecting survival (P = 0.96). Conclusions: Patients with PAH who achieve recovery to WHO-FC I or II without use of intravenous epoprostenol have similar survival to those who reach the same WHO-FC with use of intravenous epoprostenol. Benign survival of patients with PAH who have recovered to WHO-FC I or II may extend for several years after onset of the disease. ? 2014 Yamamoto et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Endothelin receptor antagonist; Epoprostenol; Phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor; Pulmonary hypertension; Survival,"antihypertensive agent; prostacyclin; adult; aged; classification; comparative study; convalescence; female; follow up; human; Hypertension, Pulmonary; intravenous drug administration; Kaplan Meier method; male; middle aged; oral drug administration; outcome assessment; pathophysiology; procedures; proportional hazards model; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; survival; time; world health organization; young adult; Administration, Oral; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Epoprostenol; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Injections, Intravenous; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Proportional Hazards Models; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Time Factors; World Health Organization; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84904017378

This study was designed to determine whether fenofibrate, a PPARα agonist, can suppress 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide (4-NQO)-induced proliferative lesions in the lung of obese hyperlipidemic mice. Male Tsumura Suzuki Obese Diabetic mice were subcutaneously injected with 4-NQO to induce lung proliferative lesions, including adenocarcinomas. They were then fed a diet containing 0.01% or 0.05% fenofibrate for 29 weeks, starting 1 week after 4-NQO administration. At week 30, the incidence and multiplicity (number of lesions/mouse) of pulmonary proliferative lesions were lower in mice treated with 4-NQO and both doses of fenofibrate compared with those in mice treated with 4-NQO alone. The incidence and multiplicity of lesions were significantly lower in mice treated with 4-NQO and 0.05% fenofibrate compared with those in mice treated with 4-NQO alone (p < 0.05). Both doses of fenofibrate significantly reduced the proliferative activity of the lesions in 4-NQO-treated mice (p < 0.05). Fenofibrate also significantly reduced the serum insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 levels, and decreased the immunohistochemical expression of IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), phosphorylated Akt, and phosphorylated Erk1/2 in lung adenocarcinomas. Our results indicate that fenofibrate can prevent the development of 4-NQO-induced proliferative lesions in the lung by modulating the insulin-IGF axis. ? 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",4-Nitroquinoline-1-oxide; Carcinogenesis; Chemoprevention; Hyperinsulinemia; Hyperlipidemia; Lung neoplasms,"4 nitroquinoline 1 oxide; fatty acid; fenofibrate; glucose; insulin; Ki 67 antigen; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma; protein kinase B; somatomedin C receptor; triacylglycerol; antilipemic agent; fenofibrate; insulin; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha; protein kinase B; somatomedin C; somatomedin C receptor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cancer inhibition; cell proliferation; chemoprophylaxis; cholesterol blood level; controlled study; hyperinsulinemia; hyperlipidemia; hyperplasia; immunohistochemistry; lung adenoma; lung cancer; lung lesion; male; mouse; nonhuman; obesity; protein expression; agonists; animal; blood; drug effects; Hyperlipidemias; lung alveolus; lung tumor; metabolism; mouse mutant; pathology; phosphorylation; Animals; Cell Proliferation; Fenofibrate; Hyperlipidemias; Hypolipidemic Agents; Insulin; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Mice; Mice, Obese; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; Phosphorylation; PPAR alpha; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Pulmonary Alveoli; Receptor, IGF Type 1",2-s2.0-84901351805

The purpose of this study was to investigate the characteristics of elderly cancer patients' concerns and examine the association between their concerns and quality of life. Methods: This was a cross-sectional web-based survey completed by ambulatory cancer patients aged 20 years or older. The questionnaire on cancer patients' concerns, comprehensive concerns assessment tool and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-C30 were distributed to the subjects. Multiple regression analysis was conducted to determine which patients' concerns significantly contributed to their quality of life. Results: The final study population consisted of 807 cancer patients, among whom 243 (30%) were elderly (65 years or older). Elderly cancer patients had particular difficulty with selfmanagement, psychological symptoms and medical information, and the prevalence of their concerns was generally lower than that of younger patients, with the exception of physical symptoms. Multiple types of elderly patients' concerns were independently associated with quality of life. Conclusions: We found that elderly cancer patients suffered from various concerns, thus multidisciplinary intervention is important for providing them with optimal care. The results of this study suggest that elderly cancer patients' quality of life will improve if their concerns are properly handled. ?

Methods: This study examined PSF and their associated factors among 17,615 adolescents, aged 12-18, in a large-scale school-based community survey in Japan. Results: PSF was noted in 7.3% of the students. The prevalence was higher among girls than among boys, and it had a tendency to decrease with age. Across the gender and age groups, PSF was associated with psychopathology, including depression and anxiety, suicidal thoughts, deliberate self-harm, violence towards objects and people, and increased difficulties at school. Discussion: We should no longer make light of public speaking fears among adolescents as transient, common-sense phenomena. ? 2012 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.",Difficulty at school; Social phobia; Speech phobia; Suicidality; Violence,difficulty at school; social phobia; speech phobia; suicidality; violence; Adolescent; Age Distribution; Child; Communication; Fear; Female; Humans; Japan; Male; Phobic Disorders; Sex Distribution; Siblings; Speech; Suicidal Ideation,2-s2.0-84894332389

These facts raise concern on possible exposure of many HIV-positive women on ART to the potential risk of unintended pregnancy. This study aimed to clarify family planning practices in Cambodia and determine predictors of risk of inconsistent condom use among women on ART. Methods. A cross-sectional survey with a structured questionnaire was conducted at five government-run health centers in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, from June to September, 2012. Multiple logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of risk of inconsistent condom use among regular users of contraceptive methods. Results: Of 408 respondents, 40, 17 and 10 used the pill, IUD, and injection, respectively, while 193 used condoms. 374 were not planning to have a child. Among 238 sexually active women who were not planning to have a baby, 59 were exposed to the risk of unintended pregnancy. Multivariate logistic regression analysis that did not include variables related to partners identified ?seeking family planning information? (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.6, 95% confidence intervals (95% CI): 1.1-6.2), awareness of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) (AOR: 4.7, 95% CI: 1.9-11.6) and ?having a son? (AOR: 2.0, 95% CI: 1.1-3.9) were significant predictors of inconsistent condom use. Another model that included all variables identified ""able to ask a partner to use condom at every sexual intercourse"" was the only predictor (AOR: 23.7, 95% CI: 5.8-97.6). Conclusions: About one-quarter of women on ART are at risk to unintended pregnancy although most do not plan to get pregnant. Furthermore, women on ART could be more empowered through improvement of communication and negotiation skills with partners to demand the use of condom during sexual intercourse. The use of other contraceptive methods that do not need partner involvement should be promoted. ? 2014 Nakaie et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",ART; Cambodia; Family planning; HIV; PMTCT,antiretrovirus agent; adult; Cambodia; condom; contraceptive behavior; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; family planning; female; HIV Infections; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; questionnaire; sexuality; socioeconomics; transmission; utilization; Adult; Anti-Retroviral Agents; Cambodia; Condoms; Contraception Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Family Planning Services; Female; HIV Infections; HIV Seropositivity; Humans; Questionnaires; Sexual Partners; Socioeconomic Factors,2-s2.0-84897595198

This study aimed to determine the dose-limiting toxicity of the combination and to define the maximum-tolerated dose, as a recommended dose for Phase II trials. We also sought to obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of this combination as a frontline therapy for extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer. Methods: We included 23 chemo-na?ve patients with extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer in the trial. The amrubicin dose was escalated from 35 to 40 mg/m2 (Levels 1 and 2, respectively) to determine the dose-limiting toxicity, with an unchanged dose of irinotecan at 50 mg/m2. Results: Of nine patients, three experienced dose-limiting toxicities at Level 1 of prolonged Grade 4 neutropenia, Grade 3 febrile neutropenia and Grade 3 febrile neutropenia with Grade 3 diarrhea. At Level 2, two patients experienced dose-limiting toxicities of Grade 4 neutropenia and Grade 3 neutropenia with Grade 4 diarrhea. The maximum-tolerated doses and recommended doses for amrubicin and irinotecan were therefore determined to be 35 and 50 mg/m2, respectively. The Level 1 trial was then expanded to 21 patients, 14 (70%) of whom showed partial responses to the recommended dose. The median progression-free and overall survival times were 6.37 and 15.21 months, respectively. Conclusions: The combination of amrubicin and irinotecan with the support of granulocyte colony-stimulation factor produced a potent effect in chemo-na?ve extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer patients. The use of biomarkers for this regimen may identify patients who are likely to suffer from treatment-ending severe adverse effects. ? The Author 2013. Published by Oxford University Press.

Here we present a case with a single brain metastasis from late relapse of a testicular germ cell tumor. This is the first report of a brain metastasis that was treated successfully only by surgery. Case presentation: A 19-year-old Japanese man presented with breathing difficulties and left testis enlargement and he was diagnosed with a yolk sac tumor following a left orchiectomy. At the time of diagnosis, multiple lung metastases were apparent on computed tomography, and serum alpha-fetoprotein level was elevated to 10,245 ng/ml. The patient received three postoperative courses of bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin and etoposide and cisplatin respectively and a complete response was obtained. Four years after surgery, the patient was admitted to the hospital due to a sudden seizure. High alpha-fetoprotein levels (539 ng/ml) were evident and magnetic resonance imaging suggested a 45-mm single brain tumor in the right parietal lobe, for which surgery was performed. The pathological diagnosis was yolk sac tumor. The alpha-fetoprotein level remained normal at 2 months after operation. There was no recurrence 24 months post-operation. Conclusion: Chemoresistance and late neurotoxicity are concerns in treating brain metastasis with chemotherapy or cerebral radiotherapy. Surgery is believed to be the optimal treatment choice if the size of the brain metastasis is larger than 35-mm and the late relapse area is surgically accessible. ? 2014 Iida et al.",Brain metastasis; Late relapse; Surgery; Testicular germ cell tumor; Yolk sac tumor,"alpha fetoprotein; antineoplastic agent; bleomycin; cisplatin; etoposide; Brain Neoplasms; case report; human; Lung Neoplasms; male; metabolism; metastasis resection; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; orchiectomy; pathology; recurrent disease; remission; secondary; Testicular Neoplasms; treatment outcome; young adult; alpha-Fetoproteins; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Bleomycin; Brain Neoplasms; Cisplatin; Etoposide; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Metastasectomy; Neoplasms, Germ Cell and Embryonal; Orchiectomy; Recurrence; Remission Induction; Testicular Neoplasms; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84989360860

Methods: Thirty-nine patients with oropharyngeal cancer received IC followed by definitive chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy. The predominant IC regimens involved cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil with or without docetaxel. Patients who responded to IC received definitive organ-preserving treatment. Surgery was considered for patients who did not respond to IC. Only patients who underwent definitive radiotherapy were analyzed in this study. The associations between clinical parameters and local control (LC) or overall survival (OS) were also analyzed. Results: The follow-up periods of the surviving patients ranged from 9-170 months (median, 40). The 5-year LC and OS rates for all 39 patients were 81% and 60%, respectively. The 5-year LC and OS rates of the IC responders, complete response or partial response (CR, PR) were 89% and 65%, respectively, whereas those of the non-responders, stable diseas e or progressive disease (SD, PD) were 34% and 38%, respectively. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the response to IC (p=0.00) and Tcategory (T1, 2 vs. T3, 4) (p=0.03) were correlated with LC, but only the response to IC was correlated with OS (p=0.04). None of the patients suffered severe late complications.

The concept of IgG4-SC recently has been recognized as that of IgG4-related diseases, and the Clinical Diagnostic Criteria of IgG4-SC 2012 was established in Japan. The diagnosis of IgG4-SC is based on the combination of the following 4 criteria: (1) characteristic biliary imaging findings, (2) elevation of serum IgG4 concentrations, (3) coexistence of IgG4-related diseases except for those of the biliary tract, and (4) characteristic histopathological features. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma and pancreatic cancer are very important diseases to consider in the differential diagnosis of IgG4-SC.

The characteristics of the 122 patients evaluated for efficacy were well balanced, except for the percentage of patients previously receiving antimicrobials, which was higher in the DRPM group than in the IPM/CS group. The clinical response rate was not significantly different between the DRPM group (93.1?%, 54/58 patients) and the IPM/CS group (93.8?%, 60/64). Non-inferiority assessment using confidence intervals demonstrated the non-inferiority of DRPM–IPM/CS. The incidence of adverse events, for which a causal relationship with either treatment was not ruled out, was 3.3?% (2/60) in the DRPM group and 3.1?% (2/65) in the IPM/CS group, and none was serious.Conclusions: The clinical efficacy of DRPM in treating moderate or severe biliary tract infection requiring drainage was comparable to that of IPM/CS. DRPM was associated with no serious adverse events and a low incidence of adverse events. The results of this trial demonstrate that DRPM is a useful therapeutic option for moderate or severe biliary tract infection. ? 2014, Springer Japan.",Biliary tract infection; Doripenem; Imipenem/cilastatin; Randomized controlled trial (RCT),"antiinfective agent; C reactive protein; carbapenem derivative; cilastatin; cilastatin, imipenem drug combination; doripenem; drug combination; imipenem; acute disease; adult; aged; Bacterial Infections; body temperature; cholangitis; Cholecystitis, Acute; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled study; drug combination; drug effects; female; human; intravenous drug administration; male; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; pathophysiology; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; very elderly; young adult; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Infections; Body Temperature; C-Reactive Protein; Carbapenems; Cholangitis; Cholecystitis, Acute; Cilastatin; Drug Combinations; Female; Humans; Imipenem; Infusions, Intravenous; Male; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84939882284

Our in vitro study revealed that the numbers of (TA) dinucleotide repeats [(TA)n] of rs72258881, which is located in the promoter region of IL28B gene, might regulate IL28B transcription. We aimed to evaluate the usefulness of these host factors for predicting virological outcomes of this therapy in response-guided clinical settings. Methods: A nationwide, multi-center prospective study in Japan determined IL28B (rs8099917) genotype, (TA)n of rs72258881, and amino acid substitutions of hepatitis C virus and used these for multivariate analysis together with other parameters at pretreatment. Results: After enrolling 215 patients with genotype 1 and high viral load from 23 hospitals between October 2009 and February 2011, intent-to-treat analysis identified 202 patients in whom the final virological outcomes could be determined. Non-virological response by non-TT genotype was predicted with 79.7% accuracy. When combined with the (TA)n, the incidences of virological response tended to be higher in the longer (TA)n group, regardless of rs8099917 genotype. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that rs8099917 non-TT genotype (P<0.001), shorter (TA)n (P=0.011), mutation of amino acid 70 in the virus core region (P=0.029), and lower levels of serum albumin (P=0.036) were independently associated with non-virological response. Conclusions: IL28B genotype and (TA)n of rs72258881 may independently affect virological outcomes of peginterferon-α and ribavirin as host factors, even in response-guided therapy. ? 2014 Wiley Publishing Asia Pty Ltd and Journal of Gastroenterology and Hepatology Foundation.",(TA) dinucleotide repeat; Chronic hepatitis C; IL28B; Response-guided therapy,"amino acid; host factor; interleukin 28B; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; ribavirin; alpha interferon; antivirus agent; IL28B protein, human; interleukin derivative; macrogol derivative; peginterferon alpha2a; peginterferon alpha2b; recombinant protein; ribavirin; adult; amino acid substitution; antiviral therapy; Article; chronic hepatitis C; dinucleotide repeat; female; gene mutation; genetic transcription; genotype; Hepatitis C virus; human; in vitro study; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; priority journal; promoter region; prospective study; treatment outcome; treatment response; virus core; virus load; aged; forecasting; genetics; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; middle aged; multivariate analysis; virology; Aged; Antiviral Agents; Female; Forecasting; Genotype; Hepacivirus; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Interferon-alpha; Interleukins; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Polyethylene Glycols; Recombinant Proteins; Ribavirin; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84929030416

Our aimwas to clarify which of these biopsy specimens and counting method could be a useful tool for supporting the diagnosis of AIP. Methods: We retrospectively evaluated biopsy specimens from pancreas (n = 19), stomach (n = 28), duodenum (n = 27), duodenal papilla (n = 25), colon (n = 19), liver (n = 11), bile duct (n = 24), and minor salivary gland (n = 13) in 36 patients with AIP. Positive IgG4 immunostaining (>10 plasma cells/highpower field [HPF]) and positive IgG4/IgG ratio (>40%) of biopsy specimens from 8 sites of 6 organs in one HPF and an average from 3 HPFs were compared between AIP and controls. Results: The sensitivity of IgG4 immunostaining for AIP in one HPF were 16% in pancreas, 14% in stomach, 15% in duodenum, 52% in duodenal papilla, 11% in colon, 27% in liver, 21% in bile duct and 8% in minor salivary gland, respectively. The positive IgG4 immunostaining of the duodenal papilla in one HPF showed the highest sensitivity (52%) and accuracy (73%) among the 8 sites. It also showed the highest sensitivity among 4 different counting methods (IgG4 immunostaining in one HPF and 3 HPFs, both IgG4 immunostaining and IgG/IgG4 ratio in one HPF and 3 HPFs), but there were no significant differences with respect to specificity and accuracy. Conclusions: IgG4 immunostaining of swollen duodenal papilla with more than 10 IgG4-positive plasma cells in at least one HPF is useful for supporting the diagnosis of AIP.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of cerebral perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and voxel-based analysis for diagnosing MSA-P patients.Methods: Thirty-eight subjects (9 with early-stage MSA-P, 11 with PD, and 18 controls) were included in this study. Z-scores suggestive of hypoperfusion were calculated between patients and controls using statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8 and easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS) programs. A voxel-based stereotactic extraction estimation (vbSEE) program was performed to determine the target volumes of interest (VOIs) in the putamen, pons, and cerebellum, and quantify Z-scores as “extent” (the rate of voxels with a Z-score >2.0 in these VOIs) and “severity” (average Z-scores in these VOIs). These parameters were used as the determinant in receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses.Results: The extent and severity of the cerebellar VOIs were higher in MSA-P patients than in PD patients. In ROC analyses, the extent and severity of the cerebellar VOI exhibited the highest areas under the curves of 0.86 and 0.84, and accuracies of 90 and 90?%, respectively.Conclusions: The diagnostic value of significant cerebellar hypoperfusion was the highest for differentiating MSA-P from PD. This voxel-based analysis of cerebral perfusion SPECT using the SPM8, eZIS, and vbSEE programs is useful for clinically diagnosing MSA-P. ? 2014, The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine.",Easy Z-score imaging system (eZIS); Multiple system atrophy (MSA); Single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT); Statistical parametric mapping (SPM); Voxel-based stereotactic extraction estimation (vbSEE),"adult; Article; brain perfusion; brain size; cerebellum; clinical article; clinical study; comparative study; controlled study; data analysis software; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; disease duration; easy Z score imaging system; female; follow up; gamma camera; human; image analysis; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; Parkinson disease; parkinsonism; pons; priority journal; putamen; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; Shy Drager syndrome; single photon emission computer tomography; SPECT scanner; voxel based stereotactic extraction estimation; aged; area under the curve; brain circulation; differential diagnosis; pathophysiology; procedures; scintiscanning; Shy Drager syndrome; single photon emission computer tomography; Aged; Area Under Curve; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multiple System Atrophy; Parkinson Disease; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",2-s2.0-84925463540

On the other hand, association between human papillomavirus infection and risk of bladder and prostatic cancer remains controversial. Case presentation: We report a rare case of a 67-year-old Japanese man with synchronous triple urogenital cancer including bladder small cell carcinoma, prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and penile squamous cell carcinoma, who presented with a history of asymptomatic gross hematuria. Bladder small cell carcinoma and prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma were diagnosed by histopathological examination after transurethral resection of the tumor. Moreover, he was diagnosed with penile carcinoma based on the exfoliative cytodiagnosis of nodular and papillary tumors inside the preputial collar. He was treated with laparoscopic radical cystectomy, urethrectomy, partial penectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection, and ileal conduit urinary diversion. To identify a common pathogenesis, we considered human papillomavirus as an etiologic factor because it is a known risk factor for penile carcinoma. Human papillomavirus deoxyribonucleic acid bands were detected by polymerase chain reaction in the three tumors. There was a possibility that human papillomavirus was involved in the carcinogenesis of the triple cancer. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the synchronous triple urogenital cancer of small cell carcinoma of the bladder, ductal adenocarcinoma of the prostate and penile squamous cell carcinoma. We believe that human papillomavirus may have been involved in the carcinogenesis of the triple urogenital cancer described in this case. ? 2014 Ogawa et al.",Human papillomavirus; Penile squamous cell carcinoma; Prostatic ductal adenocarcinoma; Small cell carcinoma of the bladder,"adenocarcinoma; aged; Carcinoma, Small Cell; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; case report; human; male; multimodality cancer therapy; Neoplasms, Multiple Primary; Papillomaviridae; pathogenicity; Penile Neoplasms; probability; Prostatic Neoplasms; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; virology; Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Carcinoma, Small Cell; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; Male; Neoplasms, Multiple Primary; Papillomaviridae; Penile Neoplasms; Probability; Prostatic Neoplasms; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms",2-s2.0-84924289123

Our efforts at answering this question constitute the basis of this report. Methods: From June 2010 to June 2011, laparoscopic adrenalectomy was performed in 10 lung cancer patients with solitary adrenal metastases (5 adenocarcinomas, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 large cell carcinoma, 1 small cell carcinoma, and 2 pleomorphic carcinomas). The surgical results of all 10 patients were examined. Results: Adrenal swelling was detected by computed tomography in all patients except 1 case of pleomorphic carcinoma. The findings of positron emission tomography– computed tomography were positive in 8 patients, including the 2 cases with pleomorphic carcinomas. Laparoscopic surgery was successfully performed in 9 cases. In the eighth patient (a case of pleomorphic carcinoma with adrenal swelling), laparoscopic adrenalectomy was attempted but conversion to open surgery was required because of clear evidence of pancreatic invasion. Conclusion: The results obtained in this study, along with other published reports, support 4 criteria as operative indications for laparoscopic adrenalectomy in solitary adrenal metastasis from the lung: (1) the primary lung cancer is resected or can be cured by radical chemotherapy, (2) metastasis is limited to the adrenal gland only, (3) adrenal metastasis does not invade the surrounding organs, and (4) the size of the adrenal tumor does not exceed 10 cm. In cases of pleomorphic carcinoma, laparoscopic adrenalectomy should be performed when positron emission tomography–computed tomography results are positive. ? 2014 by JSLS, Journal of the Society of Laparoendoscopic Surgeons.

Methods: Thirty-five patients (19 FS patients, 16 ICG patients, mean age 69.4 ± 5.1 years, mean degree of stenosis 78.7% ± 11.7%) who underwent a carotid endarterectomy (CEA) were enrolled. FS (5-6 mg/kg) or ICG (.2-.3 mg/kg) was injected intravenously as a bolus before the arterectomy during the CEA. The intravascular fluorescence signal was recorded with a digital video camera integrated on a microscope. Magnetic resonance imaging black-blood (BB) T1-weighted imaging (WI) was preoperatively performed using a 1.5-Twhole-body imager, and the signal intensity ratio relative to the ipsilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle on BB-T1WI (BB-SIR) was calculated.We also performed an immunohistochemistry study using CD31 and CD68 antibodies for plaque specimens. Results: In the FS videoangiography series, the vasa vasorum of carotid adventitia was depicted first, followed by augmentation of FS of the wall and partially the inner lumen (pattern A) in ± cases. Augmentation of FS of the wall and inner lumen prior or simultaneous to the depiction of the vasa vasorum of the carotid adventitia (pattern B) were observed in 13 cases. The average BB-SIR value of the pattern B cases was significantly higher than that in the pattern A group (P <.05). Most of the plaques with BB-SIR values higher than 1.25 also belonged to the pattern B group (90.9%). Microvessels stained by CD31 and macrophages stained by CD68 were more frequently observed in the high-BB-SIR plaques. In contrast, the ICG videoangiography uniformly showed pattern B in all 16 cases, because of the fluorolucency of the carotid wall revealed by the ICG. Conclusions: The early depiction of adventitial vasa vasorum in FS videoangiography was inversely associated with the BB-SIR values of the plaques, along with many microvessels and macrophages that have been reported to have a tendency of intraplaque hemorrhage or symptoms. The present results may support the idea of an intimal origin of the neovascularization in vulnerable carotid plaques, and they demonstrated the potential of intraoperative plaque imaging by FS videoangiography. ? 2014 by National Stroke Association.",Carotid endarterectomy; Fluorescein sodium; Indocyanine green; Vasa vasorum; Videoangiography,"CD31 antibody; CD68 antibody; fluorescein sodium; indocyanine green; protein antibody; unclassified drug; biological marker; CD31 antigen; CD68 antigen, human; differentiation antigen; fluorescein; fluorescent dye; indocyanine green; leukocyte antigen; adult; adventitia; aged; Article; brain angiography; camera; carotid artery; carotid artery obstruction; carotid endarterectomy; clinical article; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; diffusion weighted imaging; digital video camera; disease severity; female; fluorescence; human; immunohistochemistry; indocyanine green angiography; intraoperative period; macrophage; male; microscope; microvasculature; middle aged; multidetector computed tomography; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; predictive value; priority journal; signal processing; sternocleidomastoid muscle; surgical patient; vasa vasorum; videoangiography; whole body imaging; atherosclerotic plaque; Carotid Stenosis; chemistry; comparative study; fluorescence angiography; pathology; peroperative care; procedures; severity of illness index; vasa vasorum; videorecording; Aged; Antigens, CD; Antigens, CD31; Antigens, Differentiation, Myelomonocytic; Biomarkers; Carotid Arteries; Carotid Stenosis; Endarterectomy, Carotid; Female; Fluorescein; Fluorescein Angiography; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Indocyanine Green; Intraoperative Care; Macrophages; Male; Microvessels; Middle Aged; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Predictive Value of Tests; Severity of Illness Index; Vasa Vasorum; Video Recording",2-s2.0-84923295445

Recently, an animal study showed a significant association between the hOGG1 genotype and obesity, although evidence for such an association in humans is limited. The purpose of this study was to examine the association between the hOGG1 genotype and body mass index (BMI) and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis was conducted using the baseline survey data from a Japan Multi-Institutional Collaborative Cohort Study, which included 1793 participants aged 40-69 years. The hOGG1 polymorphism was detected using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction-based invader assay. Multiple linear regression, analysis of covariance, and logistic regression were used to control for confounding variables. Results: The Cys allele was significantly associated with increased BMI, FBG level, and total cholesterol (TC) level, even after adjustment for gender, age, energy intake, alcohol, smoking, physical activity, and family history of diabetes. An association with BMI was still observed after further adjustment for FBG and TC, but not for the study area (Amami or the mainland).

Consequently, a clinical trial was conducted in the National Cancer Center Hospital, Tokyo, Japan to determine whether ingestion of bLF affected the growth of colorectal polyps in humans. The Tokyo-trial found that ingestion of 3.0g bLF suppressed the growth of colorectal polyps and increased the level of serum human lactoferrin in participants 63years old or younger. The present study is a complementary study to the Tokyo-trial to determine if a change in the expression of one or more cytokines could be detected in the colon of the Tokyo-trial participants after ingesting bLF.

Methods: Between August 2008 and 2009, we studied 142 hepatitis C virus-infected patients (male 70, female 72), excluding those with HCC or a past history, who underwent EOB-MRI in our hospital. The EOB-MRI index [liver-intervertebral disc ratio (LI)] was calculated as: (post-liver intensity/post-intervertebral disc intensity)/(pre-liver intensity/pre-intervertebral disc intensity). Results: The median follow-up period was 3.1 years and the patients were observed until the end of the study period (31 December, 2012). In the follow-up period, HCC occurred in 21 patients. The cumulative occurrence rates were 2.1%, 9.1%, and 14.1% at 1, 2, and 3 years, respectively. Using the optimal cut-off value of LI 1.46, on univariate analysis, age, aspartate amino transferase (AST), α-fetoprotein (AFP) ? 10, albumin, total cholesterol, prothrombin time, platelets, and LI < 1.46 were identified as independent factors, but on multivariate analysis, LI < 1.46: risk ratio 6.05 (1.34-27.3, P = 0.019) and AFP ? 10: risk ratio 3.1 (1.03-9.35, P = 0.045) were identified as independent risk factors. LI and Fib-4 index have higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curves than other representative fibrosis evaluation methods, such as Forn's index and AST-to-platelet ratio index. Conclusion: LI is associated with the risk of HCC occurrence in hepatitis C patients. LI may be a substitute for liver biopsy when evaluating this risk and its combined use with Fib-4 is a better predictive method of HCC progression. ? 2014 Baishideng Publishing Group Inc.",Ethoxibenzyl-magnetic resonance imaging; Fibrosis; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Risk factor,,2-s2.0-84919980163

In the present study, we investigated the effect of 118 natural compounds on Aβ production in the medium of HEK293 cells stably expressing human AβPP695 (HEK293-AβPP) using Aβ42 sandwich ELISA to find natural compounds that can modulate Aβ production. We found that a coumarin derivative of citrus fruits, auraptene, increased Aβ production. Treatment of HEK293-AβPP cells and rat primary cortical neurons with auraptene significantly increased the secretion of Aβ40, Aβ42, and the Aβ42/40 ratio. However, auraptene did not change the protein levels of the AβPP processing enzymes, a disintegrin and metalloproteinases 10 (ADAM10, α-secretase), β-site AβPP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE-1, β-secretase), and presenilin 1 (PS1, γ-secretase component). Auraptene increased the activity of γ-secretase but not that of α- and β-secretase. Furthermore, auraptene enhanced γ-secretase-mediated production of Aβ from AβPP or AβPP-C99, but not through α- and β-secretase. Auraptene also phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and pretreatment with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, reduced auraptene-induced γ-secretase activity. Overall, our results suggest that auraptene-mediated activation of JNK may contribute to the production of Aβ by promoting γ-secretase activity. ? 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.",Alzheimer's disease; amyloid-β production; auraptene; c-Jun N-terminal kinase; γ-secretase,"ADAM10 endopeptidase; alpha secretase; amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta protein[1-42]; anthra[1,9 cd]pyrazol 6(2h) one; auraptene; beta secretase; beta secretase 1; gamma secretase; presenilin 1; stress activated protein kinase; ADAM protein; ADAM10 protein, human; amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta protein[1-40]; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); amyloid precursor protein; anthra(1,9-cd)pyrazol-6(2H)-one; anthracene derivative; APP protein, human; aspartic proteinase; auraptene; Bace protein, rat; central nervous system agents; coumarin derivative; membrane protein; peptide fragment; presenilin 1; protein kinase inhibitor; PSEN1 protein, human; secretase; stress activated protein kinase; animal cell; Article; brain cell; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme phosphorylation; human; human cell; nonhuman; rat; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; brain cortex; cell survival; drug effects; genetics; HEK293 cell line; metabolism; nerve cell; phosphorylation; Sprague Dawley rat; ADAM Proteins; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Amyloid beta-Protein Precursor; Amyloid Precursor Protein Secretases; Animals; Anthracenes; Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; Cell Survival; Central Nervous System Agents; Cerebral Cortex; Coumarins; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; HEK293 Cells; Humans; JNK Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Membrane Proteins; Neurons; Peptide Fragments; Phosphorylation; Presenilin-1; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Rats, Sprague-Dawley",2-s2.0-84919951860

Zerumbone inhibits carcinogenesis via reduction of inflammatory signaling, such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). In various cancers, zerumbone inhibits tumor proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis by reducing NF-κB activity. In the near future, we should focus on both careful and accurate characterization of zerumbone and better elucidation of the molecular mechanisms involved in their actions.

However, few previous studies have reported trends and outcomes of HIV-positive patients undergoing spinal surgery.Methods: Clinical data were derived from the US Nationwide Inpatient Sample between 2000 and 2009. Patients who underwent spinal fusion were identified. Data regarding HIV, patient- and health care system-related characteristics, comorbidities, in-hospital complications, and mortality were retrieved and analyzed. In-hospital outcomes were compared between HIV-positive and -negative patients and analyzed with the use of multivariate logistic regression.Results: A total of 5,070 HIV-positive patients underwent spinal fusion in the United States during the last decade. From 2000 to 2009, population-adjusted incidence of HIV-positive patients who underwent spinal fusion has increased more than 3-fold (0.094 per 100,000 in 2000 to 0.303 per 100,000 in 2009; P < 0.001). Comparison between HIV-positive and -negative patients showed that HIV-positive patients had a significantly higher respiratory complication rate (6.2% vs. 3.2%), wound-related complication rate (2.7% vs. 1.7%), overall in-hospital complication rate (12.2% vs. 9.5%), and in-hospital mortality rate (1.6% vs. 0.3%), as well as longer hospital stay (6.6 d vs. 4.2 d). The risk of in-hospital mortality was 3.53 times higher in HIV-positive patients after controlling for other factors (95% confidence interval, 2.02-6.14; P < 0.001).Conclusion: During the last decade, the incidence of HIV-positive patients undergoing spinal fusion has increased in the United States. In this study, HIV infection was an independent risk factor for inhospital mortality in patients undergoing spinal fusion.

We previously reported that levels of AT-motif binding factor 1 (ATBF1) are increased in the brains of 17-month-old Tg2576 mice compared with wild-type controls, and that Aβ42 increases ATBF1 expression, inducing death in primary rat cortical neurons. Here, we show that ATBF1 levels are increased in the cytoplasm of hippocampal neurons in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains compared with non-AD brains. Furthermore, cotransfection of human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells with ATBF1 and AβPP695 increased steady-state levels of AβPP via the binding of ATBF1 to the AβPP cytoplasmic domain (amino acids 666-690), resulting in increased Aβ production and cellular and soluble AβPP (sAβPP) levels without affecting the activity or levels of AβPP processing enzymes (α-, β-, or γ-secretase). Conversely, knockdown of endogenous ATBF1 reduced levels of cellular AβPP, sAβPP, and Aβ in HEK293 cells overexpressing human AβPP695.

No statistical difference in the clinical features was observed between individuals with and without thalamic lesions. These lesions were observed only when subcortical or cortical lesions were present. In 5 children, thalamic lesions were present in bilateral anterior or anterolateral sections and were associated with subcortical or cortical lesions in bilateral frontal lobes with central-sparing. In the other two children, thalamic lesions were extensive and accompanied by diffuse subcortical and cortical lesions without central-sparing. Conclusion Thalamic lesions in patients with acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion involve the anterior sections. The thalamocortical network may play a role in development of thalamic lesions in patients with acute encephalopathy with biphasic seizures and late reduced diffusion. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Fifteen patients had HAA, and six patients had no HAA. Follow-up ranged from 0.4 to 12.8 years (median, 7.5 years), and all patients underwent cardiac catheterization and blood pressure measurement in both the arms and legs.Results The overall median age at the time of CoA repair was seven days and the median age at the time of intracardiac defect repair was 18.6 months. There were no hospital deaths and one case had recoarctation (4.8%). The overall mean pressure gradient at the latest follow-up was 3.4±5.7 mmHg. Critical deformation of arch geometry was not found. No patient had hypertension or an abnormal arm-leg gradient. There was no difference in the cardiac catheterization data or blood pressure between patients with and without HAA.Conclusions A modified, extended end-to-end repair for CoA and HAA resulted in a low rate of recoarctation, no operative mortality, maintenance of a smooth rounded arch, and normal blood pressures in the arms and legs during mid-term follow-up. These results suggest that this technique may be acceptable for repair of CoA and HAA in neonates with intracardiac defects. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"aorta arch; aorta arch anomaly; aorta coarctation; Article; blood pressure measurement; cardiovascular surgery; clinical article; congenital heart disease; female; follow up; heart catheterization; human; hypoplastic aorta arch; male; medical record review; newborn; newborn surgery; surgical technique; treatment outcome; age; Aortic Coarctation; complication; congenital heart malformation; congenital malformation; conservative treatment; multiple malformation syndrome; procedures; thoracic aorta; time; vascular surgery; Abnormalities, Multiple; Age Factors; Aorta, Thoracic; Aortic Coarctation; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Defects, Congenital; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Organ Sparing Treatments; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Vascular Surgical Procedures",2-s2.0-84908260987

The goal of this study was to examine whether an IL28B polymorphism (rs8099917) is associated with natural clearance of HCV and with disease parameters of HCV infection in an HCV hyperendemic area of Japan. The patients were 502 anti-HCV antibody-positive residents who participated in liver disease screening program from 2002 to 2004. Patients who underwent interferon-based therapy or had hepatocellular carcinoma were excluded. Of these patients, 149 were negative for HCV RNA (prior infection) and 353 were positive for HCV RNA or HCV core antigen (HCV carriers). In multivariate analysis, the IL28B TT genotype was a predictor for prior HCV infection. In addition, nine of the patients with prior HCV infection were positive for anti- HCV antibody with positive for HCV core antigen or HCV RNA before 2001, and these nine patients all had the IL28B TT genotype. Furthermore, the IL28B TT genotype was associated independently with higher HCV core antigen levels in HCV carriers. In contrast, the IL28B genotype did not affect the biochemical markers, such as alanine aminotransferase, hepatic fibrosis markers, and a-fetoprotein, and the degree of hepatic fibrosis assessed by transient elastography in HCV carriers. We concluded that IL28B polymorphism (TT genotype) is associated with spontaneous clearance of HCV and conversely with high viral loads in HCV carriers. In contrast, the IL28B genotype does not affect disease progression such as hepatic fibrosis. ? 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",Hepatitis C virus; Interleukin 28B; Natural course; SNP,"alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alpha fetoprotein; aspartate aminotransferase; cholesterol; collagen type 4; collagen type 7; decarboxyprothrombin; ferritin; hepatitis C antibody; hepatitis C antigen; hepatitis c core antigen; hyaluronic acid; interleukin 28B; unclassified drug; virus RNA; hepatitis C antibody; IL28B protein, human; interleukin derivative; adult; aged; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; alpha fetoprotein blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; cholesterol blood level; cohort analysis; elastography; endemic disease; female; ferritin blood level; gene; genetic association; genotype; hepatitis C; human; interleukin 28b gene; Japan; liver fibrosis; major clinical study; male; predictor variable; protein blood level; screening test; single nucleotide polymorphism; thrombocyte count; viral clearance; virus carrier; virus load; blood; endemic disease; genetics; hepatitis C; middle aged; pathology; promoter region; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Endemic Diseases; Female; Hepatitis C; Hepatitis C Antibodies; Humans; Interleukins; Japan; Male; Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Viral Load",2-s2.0-84908161134

We encountered a special case in which joint remodeling was seen in a patient with rheumatoid arthritis treated with biological drugs after hip arthroscopic synovectomy and labral repair. We report the case of a 39-year-old woman with rheumatism, which was controlled with tocilizumab, prednisolone, and tacrolimus. The hip joint showed Larsen grade 3 destruction, and the Harris Hip Score was 55 points. Because of the patient's strong desire to undergo a hip preservation operation, we performed hip arthroscopic synovectomy and repair of a longitudinal labral tear. After 2.5years, the joint space had undergone rebuilding with improvement to Larsen grade 2, and the Harris Hip Score had improved to 78 points; the patient was able to return to work with the use of 1 crutch.

During the research period, lung tissue stapling was performed 10908 times.Results: Total number of AEs related to stapling was 81 (0.74%). Seventy events occurred intraoperatively and 11 events occurred postoperatively. Intraoperative stapling AEs were air leakage (n = 26), laceration of the adjacent lung tissue (n = 23), stapling failure (n = 14), oozing (n = 4), and others (n = 3). The lspostoperative AEs were prolonged air leakage (n = 9), bleeding from the chest wall (n = 1), and postoperative bleeding (n = 1). Only one case died of acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonia which was induced after completion lobectomy to cure postoperative bleeding. No relationship was seen between the incidence of AE and cartridge colors or compression types of staplers except the length of cartridges. Conclusion: Lung tissue stapling in thoracic surgery was safe. The most frequent cause of AEs was stapler-tissue thickness mismatch. The appropriate selection of the cartridge color may decrease the AE incidence of the lung tissue stapling. ? 2014 The Editorial Committee of Annals of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery.

Methods: This was a retrospective, observational study of two community general hospitals in Japan. The inclusion criteria were patients aged 65 years or older who had experienced a hip fracture and undergone surgery during April 2007 to March 2011. Data on demographics, care processes, and health outcomes during hospital stays were collected from hospital records. A questionnaire was sent to patients and/or their family members about the patients' health outcomes after discharge from hospital for hip fracture surgery. Results: Data were collected from a total of 714 patients. In both hospitals, orthopedic surgery was not scheduled every day, and the admission day was significantly related to the timing of surgery. In hospital 1, the admission day explained 38.1% of the variance in the timing of surgery, and in hospital 2, it explained 8.3%. The admission day with early surgery predicted an early discharge. The admission day with delayed surgery predicted better survival. There was no significant relationship between the timing of surgery and mortality in either hospital. Conclusion: Earlier surgery, by daily operations, may reduce the length of hospital stays, but its effect on patient outcome remains unclear. It is necessary to carefully determine which patients will benefit from earlier surgery. ? 2013 Japan Academy of Nursing Science.",Admission day; Hip fracture; Length of stay; Outcome; Timing of surgery,aged; female; Hip Fractures; hospital admission; human; male; orthopedic surgery; retrospective study; Aged; Female; Hip Fractures; Humans; Male; Orthopedic Procedures; Patient Admission; Retrospective Studies,2-s2.0-84907977129

In the current study, the patient’s apolipoprotein (apo) E gene was analyzed.Methods: An apo E isoform analysis was performed using isoelectric focusing and immunoblotting. In addition, after DNA preparation, a restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and DNA sequence analysis were performed.Results: The patient’s apo E phenotype was E2/E1, and the genotype was ε2/ε2. The sequence analysis of the patient’s DNA revealed a new variant of apo E, which involves a single substitution of one serine (AGC) for one arginine (CGC) at position 142, thereby adding one negatively charged unit to apo E2. Therefore, the patient was compound heterozygous for apo E1 (Arg142Ser) and apo E2 (Arg158Cys).Conclusions: A novel mutation, apo E1 Nagoya (Arg142Ser) in a patient with severe type hyperlipoproteinemia with heterozygous FH was characterized. Since the presence of arginine at the amino acid residue 142 of apo E is considered to play an important role in binding to LDL receptors, the mutation apo E1 Nagoya (Arg142Ser) likely contributed to the expression of severe type hyperlipoproteinemia in this patient. ? 2014, Japan Atherosclerosis Society.

The present study assessed the utility of ABCB1 and NAD(P)H quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) polymorphism as a predictor of amrubicin-induced neutropenia. Materials and Methods: Fifty-four Japanese lung cancer patients who received amrubicin chemotherapy were consecutively recruited and toxicities and SNPs (MDR1; C1236T, C3435T and G2677T/A, NQO1; C609T) were evaluated. Results: The incidence of neutropenia was higher in patients treated with 40 mg/m2 of amrubicin (n=32) compared to patients treated with 35 mg/m2 of amrubicin (n=22) (53.1% vs. 22.7%). Patients who were homogenous for the wild-type allele of C3435T were at significantly higher risk of neutropenia compared to patients with other genotypes. By contrast, the C609T genotype of NQO1 was not related to neutropenia.

Intraocular pressure of 21 mmHg or over was defined as ocular hypertension. Results: Ocular hypertension was present in 26 eyes (22%). The series comprised proliferative diabetic retinopathy 12 eyes, proliferative vitreoretinopathy 8 eyes, and ocular trauma 4 eyes among others. There was no difference regarding duration of intravitreally retained silicone oil between eyes with and without ocular hypertension. Incidence of ocular hypertension was significantly higher in eyes receiving removal of silicone oil using 25-gauge and trauma-induced retinal detachment. Conclusion: Ocular hypertension following removal of silicone oil was independent of intravitreal duration of silicone oil. It was more frequent following removal of silicone oil using 25-gauge needle, presumably resulting in retention of a minute amount of silicone oil.",,,2-s2.0-84906248721

OBJECTIVE: To examine the safety of a random flap for reconstruction of an external auditory canal based on blood flow evaluation using a laser Doppler system. METHODS: Ten healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study to compare blood flow in the face, back, and behind the ear using a laser Doppler system. Two cases of external auditory canal reconstruction are presented. RESULTS Blood flow behind the ear was abundant compared with that in the back. Blood flow in the face was higher than that behind the ear or on the back. CONCLUSION: Blood flow in the random flap was easily evaluated using the laser Doppler method.

We arranged phantoms made of various concentrations of superparamagnetic iron oxide solution adjacent to neutral fat to obtain slice planes with various fat fractions using the partial volume effect. We obtained double-GRE-FS images and calculated the T2* values. The fat fraction was calculated from signal intensities of double-GRE-FS images after T2* decay, baseline, and slope corrections. We assessed the fat fraction and the relationship between R2* of the water component and the iron concentration. In addition, we evaluated those values in human bone marrow and liver, including a patient with liver steatosis. The actual fat fraction value was consistent with the fat fraction obtained with the double-GRE-FS method, and the calculated fat fraction was unaffected by the iron concentration. There was a strong positive correlation between R 2* of the water component and the iron concentration. There was a negative correlation between the fat fraction and the bone mineral density, and the R2* was correlated with the bone mineral density. The calculated fat fraction in the liver steatosis patient was significantly higher than that in healthy volunteers. The double-GRE-FS makes it possible to assess the fat fraction and R2* simultaneously, and to obtain metabolic information on the liver and bone marrow. ? 2014 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics.",Bone marrow; Fat fraction; Liver; MRI; Relaxation rate,"analytical parameters; article; bone density; bone marrow; bone marrow fat degeneration; bone metabolism; clinical article; concentration response; controlled study; correlational study; degeneration; double gradient echo spectral fat suppression technique; fat content; fat fraction; human; human tissue; imaging phantom; iron metabolism; lipid analysis; lipid infiltration; lipid transport; liver metabolism; male; non invasive measurement; priority journal; spine; adipose tissue; bone marrow; image processing; image quality; lipid metabolism; liver; metabolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; procedures; iron; Adipose Tissue; Bone Density; Bone Marrow; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Iron; Lipid Metabolism; Liver; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Phantoms, Imaging; Spine",2-s2.0-84904437160

This is probably because of its high mechanical demand and unique anatomy. Surgical options include anterior column support (ACS) and posterior stabilization procedures. Biomechanical studies have been performed to verify the stability of those options. The options have their own advantage but also disadvantage aspects. This review article reports the surgical options for lumbosacral fusion, their biomechanical stability, advantages/disadvantages, and affecting factors in option selection. Methods: Review of literature. Conclusion: LSF has lots of options both for ACS and posterior stabilization procedures. Combination of posterior stabilization procedures is an option. Furthermore, combinations of ACS and posterior stabilization procedures are other options. It is difficult to make a recommendation or treatment algorithm of LSF from the current literature. However, it is important to know all aspects of the options and decision-making of surgical options for LSF needs to be tailored for each patient, considering factors such as biomechanical stress and osteoporosis. ? 2013 Springer-Verlag France.",Biomechanics; Lumbosacral fusion; Lumbosacral junction; Option; Spine; Surgery,"bone cement; anterior spine fusion; biomechanics; bone screw; decision making; human; lumbosacral spine; osteoporosis; priority journal; review; sacroiliac joint; spine stabilization; spondylolisthesis; surgical approach; surgical technique; bone plate; bone transplantation; devices; equipment design; lumbar vertebra; Pain, Postoperative; pathophysiology; pedicle screw; procedures; radiation dose; radiography; sacrum; Spinal Diseases; spine fusion; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Plates; Bone Transplantation; Equipment Design; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Pain, Postoperative; Pedicle Screws; Radiation Dosage; Sacroiliac Joint; Sacrum; Spinal Diseases; Spinal Fusion",2-s2.0-84903744521

Case report We report an 81-yearold man with AIP associated with IPMN. Although the initial pancreatogram was normal, a short narrowing of the main pancreatic duct (MPD) appeared during a follow-up for IPMN after 6 months, which was highly suggestive of pancreatic cancer. A narrowing of the MPD extended after 15 months, and this progressed to diffuse narrowing of the MPD with an elevation in the serum IgG4 levels after 24 months. Finally, the patient was diagnosed with diffuse-type AIP, according to the Japanese diagnostic criteria 2011 and the International Consensus Diagnostic Criteria. Considering the natural history of AIP, this marked change of the MPD is indicative of this condition.

Adalimumab (ADA) is effective for patients with Crohn's disease (CD). However, there have been few reports on ADA therapy with respect to its relationship with pathologic findings and drug efficacy in biologically na?ve CD cases. Methods. Fifteen patients with active biologically na?ve CD were treated with ADA. We examined them clinically and pathologically with ectopic MUC5AC expression in the lesions before and after 12 and 52 weeks of ADA therapy, retrospectively. Results. Both mean CD activity index scores and serum C-reactive protein values were significantly lower after ADA therapy (P < 0.001). In the MUC5AC negative group, all cases exhibited clinical remission (CR) and endoscopic improvement at 52 weeks. In MUC5AC positive groups, loss of MUC5AC expression was detected in cases having CR and endoscopic improvement at 52 weeks, while remnant ectopic MUC5AC expression was observed in those exhibiting no endoscopic improvement and flare up after 52 weeks. Conclusions. ADA leads to CR and endoscopic improvement in biologically na?ve CD cases. In addition, ectopic MUC5AC expression may be a predictive marker of flare up and endoscopic improvement in the intestines of CD patients. ? 2014 Tsutomu Mizoshita et al.",,adalimumab; azathioprine; C reactive protein; mesalazine; mucin 5AC; prednisolone; adult; article; clinical article; colonoscopy; Crohn disease; disease activity; disease duration; double balloon enteroscopy; drug efficacy; enteric feeding; female; human; hypertension; maintenance drug dose; male; protein blood level; protein expression; remission; retrospective study; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-84900315183

In experiment 2, the rats were divided into three groups, none of which received DMAB or orchiectomy, treated with TP continuously or with the treatment withdrawn once or twice. In experiment 1, invasive adenocarcinomas with abundant collagenous stroma were found in the dorsolateral and anterior prostate, some of which showed perineural space invasion at week 16. The number of invasive carcinoma foci was most frequent in group 3. In experiment 2, invasive adenocarcinoma development in the lateral prostates was correlated with the number of TP administration/withdrawal cycles. In conclusion, our newly established rat model for invasive adenocarcinoma of the prostate could serve as a useful preclinical model for evaluating the in vivo efficacy of preventive and therapeutic agents targeting of the tumor microenvironment. ? 2014 The Japanese Society of Toxicologic Pathology.",Animal model; Cancer invasion; Intermittent administration; Prostate cancer; Testosterone propionate; Transgenic rat,"2',3 dimethyl 4 biphenylamine; testosterone propionate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; drug implantation; histopathology; invasive carcinoma; male; nonhuman; orchiectomy; prostate adenocarcinoma; rat; transgenic rat; tumor invasion; tumor model",2-s2.0-84899942347

Patients with GSD-Ib are known to develop neutropenia as a specific symptom, but the causes remain unclear. To elucidate reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAD(P)H) oxidase (NOX) 2-associated mechanisms in neutrophil cell membranes, we examined the mechanism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production after differentiation from HL-60 cells, and the collapse of glycogen metabolism because of G6PT deficiency. ROS production and caspase-3 and -9 activation were observed in G6PT inhibitor-treated neutrophils but not in control cells. Suppression of ROS production by NOX2 inhibitors or protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors combined with G6PT inhibitor was found to be dependent on the concentration of each inhibitor. Furthermore, ROS production, and caspase-3 and -9 activities were dependent on glucose concentrations. These data indicate that reduced ROS production and suppressed apoptosis in the presence of PKC inhibitors may reflect suppression of PKC-induced NOX2 activation. However, under low glucose conditions, ROS production was reduced and apoptosis was suppressed in neutrophils, suggesting that glucose is a substrate for initiating ROS production. In the present study, the investigation of the pathology of GSD-Ib indicated that a high intracellular glucose level leads to an increase in ROS production by PKC induction and NOX2 activation. ? 2014 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Apoptosis; Glucose-6-phosphate transporter; Glycogen storage disease type Ib; Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase; Protein kinase C; Reactive oxygen species,"4,4' diisothiocyanatostilbene 2,2' disulfonic acid; caspase 3; caspase 9; glucose; protein kinase C; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 2; article; cell differentiation; cell membrane; controlled study; enzyme activity; G6PT gene; gene; glycogen metabolism; glycogen storage disease type 1; glycogen storage disease type 1b; human; human cell; molecular pathology; neutropenia; neutrophil",2-s2.0-84898740679

All of the patients had a history of occupational asbestos exposure. We classified patients into four groups according to the period during which their lung tissue was obtained. Asbestos and non-asbestos fibre concentrations were determined by transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis using a low-temperature ashing procedure.Results: From the 1970s to the 2000s, we observed a decrease in the geometric mean of total asbestos concentration (67.4-1.05 million fibres per gram dry lung), chrysotile concentration (25.0-0.66 million fibres per gram dry lung), amphibole asbestos concentration (21.3-0.76 million fibres per gram dry lung), and non-asbestos fibre concentration (326-19.3 million fibres per gram dry lung). The mean duration of asbestos exposure decreased from 33.7 to 17.6 years, and the mean duration since the last exposure increased from 0.3 to 21.5 years. The percentage of longer fibres to total fibres tended to increase over time, whereas the mean fibre length did not differ significantly.Conclusions: The present study suggested that asbestos and non-asbestos fibre concentrations in the lung tissues of Japanese patients with mesothelioma who have occupational histories of asbestos exposure may have decreased from the 1970s to the 2000s. ? 2013 ?

The attribution of auditory hallucinations to other people is considered to lead to secondary delusions. This study examined whether brief psychoeducation can change the cognition of auditory hallucinations, particularly, their attribution, and thus alleviate secondary delusions. Twenty-two schizophrenic patients with auditory hallucinations were recruited in this open study. The intervention consisted of five sessions during the course of 4 weeks. Outcome measures were used to assess delusions, beliefs about auditory hallucinations, and depression. At the end of the intervention, statistically significant reduction was observed in both delusions and depression. Beliefs about hallucinations showed statistically significant improvement in terms of malevolence, omnipotence, and resistance but not in terms of benevolence and engagement. In conclusion, the present study suggests that psychoeducation might be useful in reducing secondary delusions without exacerbating a depressive state.

This discrepancy may stem from a number of factors, including changes in accepted BCG indications, the introduction of restaging transurethral resection (re-TUR), the concept of BCG maintenance, and the evolution of histopathological diagnostic criteria. ?
