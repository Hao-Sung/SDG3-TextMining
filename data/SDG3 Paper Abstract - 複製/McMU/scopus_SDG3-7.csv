In this study, we sought to describe the patient experience on SGLT-2 inhibitors and examine whether there have been improvements in dietary perception and satisfaction with these drugs. Methods: Adults ?40 years of age with type 2 diabetes and using SGLT-2 inhibitors for at least 1 month were recruited to take part in one-time 1-on-1 interviews. An interpretive descriptive methodology was used. Data collection and analysis occurred concurrently and a constant comparative analysis was used. Results: An overall positive response to SGLT-2 inhibitor use was observed. Interviews revealed 3 themes: Recognizing, Reckoning and Realizing. In Recognizing, all patients reported a significant relationship with food that was typically negative and included feelings of food restriction and deprivation. Positive side effects of the drug in Reckoning included better glycemic control, weight loss and improved energy. Some participants were motivated in Realizing to pursue additional behavioural changes to improve their diabetes management. Conclusions: An improved dietary-related quality of life was described by some participants. Although not all individuals were seen to move into the Realizing phase after initiating an SGLT-2 inhibitor, there appeared to be an opportunity to create a behaviour change after positive Reckoning experiences. ? 2019 Canadian Diabetes Association",interpretive description; patient experience; patient-reported outcomes; sodium glucose cotransporter 2; type 2 diabetes,dapagliflozin; empagliflozin; sodium glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor; adult; aged; Article; behavior change; body weight loss; candidiasis; clinical article; descriptive research; diet restriction; drug safety; female; food deprivation; glycemic control; human; information processing; interview; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; patient satisfaction; perception; personal experience; polyuria; quality of life; treatment duration; treatment response; urinary tract infection; urogenital tract infection,2-s2.0-85071144215

This paper offers a sort of companion paper that adapts this methodology to possibilistic sources. Possibility theory is particularly well suited to cope with incomplete information from poor-data sources. The methodology and algorithms used for the probabilistic approach are adapted for the possibilistic case. Both approaches are then compared by the means of a numerical example and four experimental benchmark datasets: one, the IRIS data set, being data-poorer than the three other ones (Diabetes dataset, Glass dataset and Liver-disorder dataset). A vector representation is introduced for a possibility distribution as in the probabilistic case and, the Gini's formulation of entropy is being used. However, the Gini's entropy has to be used differently than with the probabilistic case. This has an impact on the selection of subsets. A fusion scheme is designed to select the best-quality subsets according to two information quality factors: quantity of information and source credibility. Results obtained from comparison of both approaches on the four experimental benchmarks confirm the superiority of the possibilistic approach in the presence of information scarcity or incompleteness. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Gini entropy; Information fusion; Possibility theory; Quality of information; Source credibility; Uncertainty,Decision making; Entropy; Information fusion; Experimental benchmarks; Possibilistic informations; Possibility distributions; Possibility theory; Probabilistic approaches; Quality of information; Source credibilities; Uncertainty; Probability distributions,2-s2.0-85070678217

As both of these systems involve different techniques, the primary objective of this study was to evaluate the performance and accuracy of each system using results achieved from XRF measurements. The assessment of the two systems was carried out by investigating tissues samples containing invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) of the breast and normal surrounding breast tissues. The results established from the two XRF systems are in a very good agreement with each other. The statistical analysis reveals a significant and measurable increase (p < 0.01) in the concentration of K, Ca, Zn, Rb and Fe (p < 0.05) in the tumorous tissue when compared with the healthy tissue. However, the levels of Cl, Cu and Br attained by both systems have not demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the normal and cancerous tissues. Investigating the structural components of the same breast tissues using each of the X-ray Diffraction (XRD) spectrometers incorporated in both systems indicated a statistically significant difference in the components of normal and malignant samples. Furthermore, the results have shown a significant increase in the fibrous and water contents of the tumour tissue at p < 0.01, and a significant increase in the adipose content of the normal tissue at (p < 0.01). The results acquired from both XRD approaches were shown to be statistically compatible with each other. Overall, the comparisons between the two X-ray detection systems have shown improved results for the combined PEDXRF and EDXRD system for the purpose of classifying normal and tumour breast tissues. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Breast cancer; Breast margin assessment; Structural components; Trace elements; X-ray diffraction; X-ray fluorescence,Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fluorescence; Trace elements; Tumors; X ray diffraction; Breast Cancer; Breast margin assessment; Energy dispersive x-ray diffractions; Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence; Invasive ductal carcinomata; Statistically significant difference; Structural component; X ray fluorescence; Histology,2-s2.0-85064263203

As older adults are enrolled in these programs, they are confronted with two dominant and legitimate accounts of medications, labeled the medication paradox: medications keep you healthy but they might be making you sick. We investigated how the medication paradox operates in the lives of older adults. In-depth qualitative interviews were conducted and analyzed with older adults aged 70+ to identify the various paradoxes that seniors live through regarding their medications and the narratives that they engage to negotiate these contradictions. Older adults were found to have established interpretative repertoires to make sense of the incongruent narratives of the medication paradox. In this article, we demonstrate older adults’ efforts to carve out their unique place in the dichotomized institution of medicine. ?

Although valuable, this work-up process can lead to attrition before surgery. Therefore, we aim to assess patient and health system factors associated with attrition after bariatric surgery referral in a universal healthcare system. Methods: This was a population-based study of all patients aged ? 18 referred for bariatric surgery in Ontario, Canada from 2009 to 2015. Primary outcome was patients who dropped out of bariatric surgery after referral. Predictors of attrition after referral included patient demographics, clinical, institutional, and socioeconomic variables. Odds ratios and 95% CIs were estimated by multilevel logistic regression models. Results: From 17,703 patients that were referred for bariatric surgery, 4122 patients dropped after the initial referral. Male patients, increasing age, and longer wait times for surgery were significantly (P < 0.0001) associated with higher odds of attrition. Additionally, smoker status, immigration status, unemployment, and disability were significant factors (P < 0.0001) predicting attrition. Patients who lived in lowest income quintile neighborhoods, when compared to those from the richest neighborhoods, had significantly higher odds of attrition (P = 0.02). Sleep apnea was associated with lower odds of attrition while diabetes and heart failure both with higher odds of attrition. Conclusion: Even in a universal healthcare system, there are various factors that could lead to increased odds of attrition before bariatric surgery. Clear disparities exist for certain marginalized populations. Further studies are warranted to ensure equitable utilization of bariatric surgery for all patients. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Attrition; Bariatric surgery; Drop out; Universal Healthcare,adult; Article; bariatric surgery; Canada; clinical outcome; controlled study; disability; female; health care system; heart failure; human; immigration; major clinical study; male; neighborhood; obesity; patient referral; people by smoking status; priority journal; retrospective study; sleep disordered breathing; unemployment,2-s2.0-85067413043

However, there remains a lack of standardization and agreement about reporting swallowing outcomes in studies that assess treatment outcomes in this population. A systematic review was performed following PRISMA Guidelines by searching Pubmed (MEDLINE) and Scopus. The inclusion criteria used included (1) prospective and retrospective clinical studies involving adult patients with oropharyngeal cancer, (2) reports swallowing outcomes, (3) English studies or studies with English translation, (4) full text retrievable and (5) publication between 1990 and 2016. 410 unique studies were identified, and 106 were analyzed. A majority (> 80%) of studies that reported swallowing outcomes were published after 2010. While 75.4% of studies reported subjective outcomes (e.g., patient-reported or clinician-reported outcome measures), only 30.2% of studies presented results of objective instrumental assessment of swallowing. The majority (61%) of studies reported short-term swallowing outcomes at 1?year or less, and only 10% of studies examined 5-year swallowing comes. One study examined late-dysphagia (> 10?years) in the oropharyngeal cancer population. Considerable heterogeneity remains in the reporting of swallowing outcomes after treatment of oropharyngeal cancer despite its importance for quality of life. Studies reporting long-term swallowing outcomes are lacking in the literature, and objective measures of swallowing function remain underutilized and nonstandardized. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Deglutition and deglutition disorders; Dysphagia outcomes; Metrics; Oropharyngeal cancer,Article; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; clinical outcome; clinician; disease association; dysphagia; evidence based medicine; human; oropharynx cancer; outcome assessment; patient-reported outcome; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; surgical oncologist; systematic review; treatment response; trend study,2-s2.0-85062799298

Nevertheless, the functional connectivity of neural circuitry associated with delay discounting and the ways in which the social environment may influence frontostriatal connectivity remain largely unknown, particularly in African Americans. Building on recent literature implicating frontostriatal connectivity during active delay discounting decision making and at rest, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to assess the association between delay discounting and frontostriatal resting state connectivity (rsFC). We also examined the capacity of social relationships with parents and peers to longitudinally predict frontostriatal rsFC. The study cohort was composed of 91 rural African American emerging adults followed over a 6-year period. Greater (i.e., more positive) frontostriatal rsFC was associated with decreased delay discounting (i.e., less impulsive decision making). In addition, peer relationships at ages 20 and 21 significantly predicted frontostriatal rsFC at age 25 above and beyond parental influence. A significant indirect effect of peer affiliation on delay discounting through frontostriatal rsFC also emerged. These results indicate a role of frontostriatal connectivity in delay discounting decision making and highlight peers’ unique influence on decision making behaviors through frontostriatal rsFC during emerging adulthood. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Delay discounting; Emerging adulthood; Frontostriatal connectivity; Parent influence; Peer influence,adult; adulthood; African American; article; cohort analysis; decision making; delay discounting; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; major clinical study; male; peer group; peer pressure; rest; social interaction,2-s2.0-85055969549

This commentary explores the role of needle and syringe programs (NSPs) in providing hepatitis C treatment to PWID through an exploration of Positively Hep, a peer-referral, incentive-based project in Sydney, Australia. Positively Hep uses peer-networks to engage clients and introduce them to hepatitis C education, screening, and treatment. Within the first 26?months of operation, Positively Hep has provided education about hepatitis C and DAA treatments to 326 individuals, and has tested 145 people, 44% (n = 64) of whom have tested positive. Of these individuals, 21 (33%) have begun treatment, and 18 (28%) have successfully completed treatment. Positively Hep highlights the benefits of having trustworthy, timely, convenient, and client-friendly services to engage PWID and support them throughout hepatitis C treatment. This commentary is intended to prompt discussion about incorporating hepatitis C treatment into NSP service delivery, which could increase treatment uptake among PWID and support progress toward elimination targets. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Hepatitis C; needle and syringe programs; service delivery; treatment,,2-s2.0-85062956510

Method: The CLSA Comprehensive Cohort is composed of 30,097 participants aged 45–85years at baseline who provided a broad range of sociodemographic, physical, social, and psychological health information via questionnaire and took part in detailed physical and cognitive assessments. Cognitive measures included: the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test–immediate and 5-min delayed recall, Animal Fluency, Mental Alternation Test (MAT), Controlled Oral Word Association Test (COWAT), Stroop Test–Victoria Version, Miami Prospective Memory Test (MPMT), and a Choice Reaction Time (CRT) task. Results: CLSA Comprehensive Cohort sample sizes were far larger than previous studies, and performances on the cognitive measures were similar to comparable groups. Within the CLSA Comprehensive Cohort, main effects of age were observed for all cognitive measures, and main effects of language were observed for all measures except the CRT. Interaction effects (language × age) were observed for the MAT, MPMT Event-based score, all time scores on the Stroop Test, and most COWAT scores. Main effects of education were observed for all measures except for the MPMT Time score in the French sample, and interaction effects (age × education) were observed for the RAVLT (immediate and delayed) for the English sample and the Stroop Dot time for the French sample. Conclusion: This examination of the cognitive measures used in the CLSA Comprehensive Cohort lends support to their use in large studies of health and aging. We propose further exploration of the cognitive measures within the CLSA to make this information relevant to and available for clinical practice. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",CLSA; Cognition; language; older adults; population-based,adult; aged; aging; article; choice reaction time; clinical practice; cohort analysis; controlled oral word association test; controlled study; education; female; human; human experiment; language; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prospective memory; psychological well-being; questionnaire; recall; Rey auditory verbal learning test; sample size; Stroop test,2-s2.0-85060054189

On one hand, oncolysis of OV-infected malignant entities reinstates cancer immunosurveillance. On the other hand, overexpression of TAAs in infected cells further stimulates the adaptive arm of antitumor immunity. Particularly, the presence of tumor-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment, as well as in the periphery, has demonstrated prognostic value for cancer treatments. These effector CD8+ T cells can be detected through their production of the prototypical Tc1 cytokine: IFN-γ. The quantitative and qualitative assessment of this immune cell subset remains critical in the development process of efficient cancer vaccines, including oncolytic vaccines. The present chapter will describe a single-cell immunological assay, namely the intracellular cytokine staining (ICS), that allows the enumeration of IFN-γ-producing TAA-specific CD8+ T cells in various tissues (tumor, blood, lymphoid organs) following oncolytic vaccination. ? 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cancer vaccine; Flow cytometry; IFN-γ; Intracellular cytokine staining (ICS); Oncolytic virus; Tumor antigen,,2-s2.0-85071759438

Materials and methods: The Canadian hereditary RCC risk criteria were applied to patients from 16 centres in the Canadian Kidney Cancer information system (CKCis) prospective database. The primary end point was the proportion of patients who met at least one criterion. Results: Between January 2011 and May 2017, 8388 patients were entered in the database; 291 had inadequate risk data; 2827 (35%) met at least one criterion for genetic testing (at-risk population). Most (83%) met just one criterion. The criterion of non-clear cell histology contributed the largest proportion of at-risk patients (59%), followed by age ? 45 years (28%). Sixty-one patients had documentation of genetic testing, with 56 being classified at-risk (2% of at-risk). Twenty patients (35%) of the patients at risk and tested for hereditary RCC were found to harbour a germline mutation. Conclusions: Application of the Canadian hereditary RCC risk criteria to a large prospective database resulted in 35% of patients being identified at risk for hereditary RCC who could qualify for genetic testing. However, the true incidence of hereditary RCC in this population is unknown as most patients did not have documented genetic testing carried out and, thus, the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria cannot be determined. The low proportion of at-risk patients who underwent genetic testing is disappointing and highlights that there may be gaps in reporting, knowledge and/or barriers in access to genetic testing. ? 2019 The Royal College of Radiologists",Genetic consultation; hereditary; renal cell carcinoma,adult; Article; Canada; cancer classification; cancer patient; cancer risk; controlled study; data base; family study; female; genetic screening; germline mutation; hereditary tumor syndrome; histopathology; human; major clinical study; male; medical documentation; medical information system; population genetics; population research; practice guideline; priority journal; prospective study; renal cell carcinoma; risk assessment,2-s2.0-85069961938

Study Design and Setting: After initial brainstorming with GRADE Working Group members, we iteratively refined and clarified the approaches for defining ranges when assessing the certainty of evidence for test accuracy within a systematic review, health technology assessment, or guideline. Results: Ranges can be defined both for single test accuracy and for comparative accuracy of multiple tests. For systematic reviews and health technology assessments, approaches for defining ranges include some that do not require value judgments regarding downstream health outcomes. Key challenges arise in the context of a guideline that requires ranges for sensitivity and specificity that are set considering possible effects on all critical outcomes. We illustrate possible approaches and provide an example from a systematic review of a direct comparison between two test strategies.

There is further need to understand interest level and the potential role of music care among health professionals working in the field of oncology. Purpose: To investigate knowledge of and attitudes toward the use of music as a therapeutic tool in cancer and palliative care, as well as to identify barriers associated with learning to use music in care among health professionals. Methods: Participants (N = 204), mostly nurses working in oncology and palliative care, completed a survey to assess awareness, knowledge, and attitudes toward the use of music in healthcare practice. Results: In total, 55.5% of participants reported being “somewhat or very knowledgeable” about how to apply/use music therapy for the management of symptoms or on how to make a music therapy referral or for any application of music care. Participants demonstrated a high interest level in learning how to incorporate music into practice (mean = 4.05; SD = 1.045). Conclusion: While there is generally high interest and perceived value among nurses in music care interventions, knowledge level about such interventions was low. The study has implications for knowledge translation and education needed to further support uptake and use of music care in nursing practice. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Attitudes; Music care; Music therapy; Nurses; Oncology,adult; Article; awareness; cancer palliative therapy; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; female; health care personnel; health care survey; health personnel attitude; human; learning; male; malignant neoplasm; motivation; music therapy; paramedical personnel; patient referral; physician; practical nurse; priority journal; professional knowledge; radiotherapist; social worker,2-s2.0-85065393914

Evidence of older adult and family members’ engagement in discharge decision-making, however, varies widely. Some recent work shows assumed associations between ageing, diminished participation in healthcare decision-making and increased reliance on family members. Other research suggests that family members adopt strategies to promote older adults’ participation in decision-making. Relational autonomy theory suggests that individuals have differing levels of autonomy and that individuals’ agency can be supported (or marginalized) by others. Purpose: Using three case studies, we examine traditional and relational conceptions of autonomy and explore how relational approaches could inform healthcare practice. Methods: Taking a critical feminist bioethics perspective, we present a secondary analysis of three microethnographic case studies focused on discharge planning with older adults in one Canadian inpatient rehabilitation setting. The data consist of observations of discharge planning family conferences and semi-structured interviews with older adults and family members. Results: Tensions between older adults’ wishes to return home and their diminished participation in discharge decisions, and family members’ assumption of a primary role in discharge decision-making and their wish for the older adult to move to a supported setting were apparent. To reconcile these tensions, the older adults’ family members in these cases employed strategies to promote older adults’ participation in decision-making that were consistent with relational autonomy theory. Conclusion and implications for practice: The analysis suggests that older adults’ participation in discharge decision-making processes could be better promoted through relational approaches.Implications for rehabilitation ???Adopting an approach guided by relational autonomy might better enable patients to participate in decision-making than would an approach guided by traditional conceptions of autonomy. ???Rehabilitation professionals could seek assistance from family members and guide them toward collaborative partnerships. ???A range of strategies may be employed to customize relational approaches to enhance autonomy: ?? ??having several different conversations with patients to enable multiple chances to contribute knowledge and views; ?? ??involving family members or taking the time to explain information several different times and in diverse manners; ?? ??showing patients videos or photos of discharge locations; ?? ??exploring a breadth of potential discharge options; ?? ??accompanying patients to visit different options in person; and ?? ??getting patients in touch with individuals who have made similar choices. ???It is recognized that taking a relational approach might be time-consuming and that practice contexts may not be conducive to such practice. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Autonomy; decision-making; discharge planning; older adults; relational autonomy,aged; article; bioethics; conception; conversation; decision making; feminism; health care practice; hospital discharge; hospital patient; human; rehabilitation; secondary analysis; semi structured interview; tension; touch; videorecording,2-s2.0-85054708853

Although guidelines have been established for the clinical care of obese pregnant women, management is sometimes suboptimal. Our goal was to determine the feasibility of implementing and testing a clinical carepath for obese pregnant women compared to standard care, in a pilot cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT). Methods: A pragmatic pilot cluster RCT was conducted, randomly allocating eight clinics to the carepath or standard care for obese pregnant women. Women were eligible if they had a pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) of ?30 kg/m2 and a viable singleton &lt;21 weeks. The primary outcomes were the feasibility of conducting a full-scale cluster RCT (defined as &gt;80%: randomization of clinics, use in eligible women, and completeness of follow-up) and of the intervention (defined as &gt;80%: compliance with each step in the carepath and recommendation of the carepath by clinicians to a colleague). Results: All eight approached clinics agreed to participate and were randomized. Half of the intervention clinics used the carepath, resulting in &lt;80% uptake of eligible women. High follow-up (99.5%) was achieved, in 188 of 189 women. The carepath was feasible for numerous guideline-directed recommendations for screening, but less so for counseling topics. When the carepath was used in the majority of women, all clinicians, most of whom were midwives, reported they would recommend it to a colleague. The intervention group had significantly higher overall adherence to the guideline recommendations compared to control (relative risk: 1.71, 95% confidence interval: 1.57–1.87). Conclusions: In this pragmatic pilot cluster RCT, a guideline-directed clinical carepath improved some aspects of care of obese pregnant women and was recommended by clinicians, particularly midwives. A cluster RCT may not be feasible in a mix of obstetric and midwifery clinics, but may be feasible in midwifery clinics. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",care pathway; Clinical carepath; obesity; pregnancy,adult; Article; body mass; clinical article; clinical pathway; cluster analysis; controlled study; feasibility study; female; follow up; gestational age; health care delivery; human; maternal obesity; midwife; multicenter study; outcome assessment; parallel design; patient care; patient counseling; pilot study; practice guideline; pragmatic trial; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prepregnancy care; priority journal; protocol compliance; randomized controlled trial; clinical pathway; clinical trial; complication; health care quality; obesity; organization and management; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; pregnancy outcome; prenatal care; procedures; Adult; Body Mass Index; Cluster Analysis; Critical Pathways; Female; Humans; Midwifery; Obesity; Pilot Projects; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Outcome; Prenatal Care; Standard of Care,2-s2.0-85048074780

This is particularly an issue in oncology trials where the standard-of-care is shifting rapidly and several promising experimental treatments are undergoing phase III testing. Novel methods for utilizing external control data may mitigate these challenges, but applied examples are sparse. Here, we therefore illustrate how Bayesian dynamic borrowing of external individual patient level control data from similar clinical trials can often reduce randomization to the control intervention without substantially trading-off precision. We further explore which types of scenarios yield viable trade-offs, and which do not. Patients and methods: We obtained individual patient data on patients being treated with second-line therapy for non-small cell lung cancer from Project Data Sphere with minimal in/exclusion criteria restrictions, and applied Bayesian hierarchical models with uninformative priors to generate illustrative synthetic control groups. Results: Four phase III clinical trials were identified and utilized in our analysis. Even when studies which are knowingly incongruent with one another are selected to generate a synthetic control, the nature of this methodology minimizes improper borrowing from historical data. The use of a small concurrent control group within a trial greatly reduces penalized selection, and our results demonstrate the ability to reduce allocation to the control group by up to 80% with a minimal increase in uncertainty when closely matched historical data is available. Conclusion: Dynamic borrowing using Bayesian hierarchical models with uninformative priors represents a novel approach to utilizing external controls for comparative estimates using single arm evidence. ? 2019",Bayesian hierarchical model; Dynamic borrowing; External control; NSCLC; Oncology; Synthetic control,Article; cancer therapy; clinical assessment; clinical research; clinical trial (topic); control group; controlled study; dynamic Bayesian network; hierarchical clustering; human; medical information; non small cell lung cancer; patient coding; patient participation; phase 2 clinical trial; phase 3 clinical trial; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; randomized controlled trial (topic); resource allocation; sample size; therapy effect,2-s2.0-85072053688

This study aimed to validate a nutritional algorithm with specific application to the low- and middle-income country (LMIC) setting. Procedure: Fifty children with a new diagnosis of cancer were enrolled in this randomized interventional study. Weight, height/length, and mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) were measured at baseline. The study arm was administered nutritional care as per the algorithm and the control arm received the institutional standard of care. Weight was monitored regularly and MUAC was repeated after 3 months. Children were classified based on weight for height if <2 years of age or body mass index if ?2 years, as normal, wasted, and severely wasted. The algorithmic approach comprised administration of oral supplements, nasogastric feeds, and/or parenteral nutrition based on objective assessment of the nutritional status. Results: Fifty patients were analyzed (study: 25, control: 25). Four in the study arm (16%) and six in the control arm (24%) had wasting at baseline. MUAC was <5th percentile in 15 (60%) and 13 (52%) patients in the study and control arms, respectively. At the end of 3 months, the median increment in weight was 0.8?kg (interquartile range [IQR]: –0.02; 2.00) and 0.0?kg (IQR: –0.70; 1.25) in the study and control arms, respectively (P?=.153). The median increment in MUAC was 1.20?cm (IQR: 0.10; 2.30) and 0.00?cm (IQR: –0.50; 1.10) in the study and control arms, respectively (P?=.020). Conclusions: The application of an algorithm designed for use in LMICs resulted in significant improvement in nutritional status, as measured by MUAC. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",developing country; mid-arm circumference; pediatric oncology; survival gap; undernutrition,acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; algorithm; anthropometry; arm circumference; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; child; childhood obesity; clinical article; controlled study; diet supplementation; dietary intake; enteric feeding; erythrocyte concentrate; erythrocyte transfusion; Ewing sarcoma; febrile neutropenia; female; follow up; high income country; Hodgkin disease; human; intervention study; low income country; male; nephroblastoma; nose feeding; nutrition; nutritional assessment; nutritional status; open study; outcome assessment; parallel design; parenteral nutrition; pilot study; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; thrombocyte transfusion; total parenteral nutrition,2-s2.0-85071566742

Methods: A search of the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), the Excerpta Medica dataBASE (EMBASE), Web of Science, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PubMed to June 2018 was performed using methods pre-published on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Reporting followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies comparing UI status in obese patients before and after bariatric surgery were included. Primary outcomes were the improvement or complete resolution of any UI, stress UI (SUI), and urgency UI (UUI). Secondary outcomes were validated UI questionnaire scores. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach assessed overall quality of evidence. Results: In all, 33 cohort studies (2910 patients) were included (median follow-up 12?months). Bariatric surgery resulted in improvement or resolution of any UI in 56% (95% confidence interval [CI] 48–63%), SUI in 47% (95% CI 34–60%), and UUI in 53% (95% CI 32–73%) of patients.

However, worsening or new onset of UI was present in 3% of patients. The quality of evidence was very low for all outcomes. Conclusion: Half of obese patients report improvement or resolution of UI after bariatric surgery, but overall the quality of evidence is very low.

This study assessed the quality of life and function of young people who have poor vision or blindness by asking directly about their personal experiences. Methods: A modified version of the VFQ-25 was administered to 47 students at a school for blind youth. All students who received the test had visual acuity scores of 20/100 or worse. The VFQ-25 scoring system was used, and results from additional qualitative questions were themed and ranked. Further analysis was performed, using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to check for correlation between duration of blindness and VFQ score. Results: Participants recorded a composite VFQ score of 65, showing that poor vision had a self-perceived moderate effect on their daily function. Proportion of participant's life spent with visual impairment correlated with higher composite scores. In general, lower scores were reported by participants with worse visual acuity. However, variations were observed in the mental health category. Conclusions: Young people have a more optimistic and nuanced view of their function than expected based on VFQ scores of other groups.

MetaGxData is the largest compendium of curated transcriptomic data for these cancer types to date, spanning 86 datasets and encompassing 15,249 samples. Open access to standardized metadata across cancer types promotes use of their transcriptomic and clinical data in a variety of cross-tumour analyses, including identification of common biomarkers, and assessing the validity of prognostic signatures. Here, we demonstrate that MetaGxData is a flexible framework that facilitates meta-analyses by using it to identify common prognostic genes in ovarian and breast cancer. Furthermore, we use the data compendium to create the first gene signature that is prognostic in a meta-analysis across 3 cancer types.

Women with GDM are at a high risk of developing both short- and long-term complications. Various studies have shown the heightened risk of type 2 diabetes among women with GDM. Despite clear evidence from published literature about the substantial risk that GDM imposes on women after delivery, rates of postpartum follow up have been low in most parts of the world. Several reasons, such as lack of awareness among health-care professionals and patient-related barriers, such as emotional stress and adjusting to motherhood, have been cited as reasons for poor follow-up rates. To address these issues and come up with solutions to improve postpartum follow-up rates, it is important to understand these barriers both from the patient and the health-care system points of view. In this review, we have summarized some of the key issues contributing to the low postpartum follow-up rates and have discussed possible strategies to tackle them.

We aimed to investigate whether there are differences in the response of macrophages derived from patients in the early stages and late stages of BD and healthy subjects. Methods: Human monocytes purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with BD type I (n = 18)—further classified into early- and late stage BD patients according to their functioning- and from healthy individuals (n = 10) were differentiated into macrophages in vitro. Monocyte-derived macrophages (M) were exposed to IFNγ plus LPS-M(IFNγ + LPS)- or IL-4-M(IL-4)—to induce their polarization into the classical (also called M1) or alternative (also called M2) activation phenotypes, respectively; or either Mψ were not exposed to any stimuli characterizing the resting state (denominated M0). In vitro secretion of cytokines, such as IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-α, was used as an index of macrophage activity. Results: M(IFNγ + LPS) from late-stage BD patients produced less amount of IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-10 when compared to early-stage BD patients and healthy controls. Following alternative activation, M(IL-4) derived from late-stage patients secreted less IL-6 compared to the other groups. TNFα was less secreted by all macrophage phenotypes derived from late-stage patients when compared to healthy controls only (p < 0.005). Mψ from late-stage patients exhibited lower production of IL-1β and IL-10 compared to macrophages from healthy subjects and early-stage patients respectively. Interestingly, cytokines secretion from M(IFNγ + LPS), M(IL-4) and Mψ were similar between early-stage patients and healthy controls. Conclusion: Our results suggest a progressive dysfunction in the response of peripheral innate immune cells of BD patients in the late stages of the illness. This failure in the regulation of the immune system function may be implicated in the multisystemic progression of BD. ? 2019, The Author(s).",Bipolar disorder; Inflammatory cytokines; Macrophage dysfunction; Macrophage polarization; Mood disorders,anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; benzodiazepine; gamma interferon; interleukin 10; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 6; lithium; neuroleptic agent; tumor necrosis factor; adult; Article; bipolar disorder; clinical article; cognitive bipolar rating assessment; controlled study; depression; DSM-IV; female; gene expression; Hamilton Depression Rating Scale; hospitalization; human; immune response; immune system; inflammation; innate immunity; macrophage; male; mental disease assessment; middle aged; monocyte; peripheral blood mononuclear cell; phenotype; polarization; priority journal; quality control; suicide attempt; Young Mania Rating Scale,2-s2.0-85066475444

This necessity places a tremendous financial and logistical burden on vaccination programs, particularly in the developing world. The development of thermally stable vaccines can greatly alleviate this problem and, in turn, increase vaccine accessibility worldwide. In this paper, we detail a simple and cost-effective method for stabilizing live vaccines that uses FDA-approved materials. To this end, we dried enveloped DNA (Herpes Simplex Virus type 2) and RNA (Influenza A virus) viral vaccines in a pullulan and trehalose mixture. The results of these studies showed that the live-attenuated HSV-2 vaccine retained its efficacy for at least 2 months of storage at 40 °C, while the inactivated influenza vaccine was able to retain its immunogenicity for at least 3 months of storage at 40 °C. This work presents a simple approach that allows thermo-sensitive vaccines to be converted into thermo-stable vaccines that do not require refrigeration, thus contributing to the improvement of vaccine deployment throughout the world. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85066066889

Careful consideration should be given to targeting this population for therapy. Purpose: Fracture risk assessment has focused on a long-term horizon and populations with a broad risk range. For elderly women with osteoporosis or low bone mass, or a history of fragility fractures (“high-risk women”), risk prediction over a shorter horizon may have greater clinical relevance. Methods: A repeated-observations design and data from the Canadian Multicentre Osteoporosis Study were employed. Study population comprised women aged ? 65?years with T score (total hip, femoral neck, spine) ? ? 1.0 or prior fracture. Hazard ratios (HR) for predictors of low-trauma non-vertebral fracture during 2-year follow-up were estimated using multivariable shared frailty model. Results: The study population included 3228 women who contributed 5004 observations; 4.8% experienced low-trauma non-vertebral fracture during the 2-year follow-up. In bivariate analyses, important risk factors included age, back pain, history of falls, history of low-trauma fracture, physical function, health status, and total hip T score. In multivariable analyses, only four independent predictors were identified: falls in past 12?months (? 2 falls: HR = 1.9; 1 fall: HR = 1.5), low-trauma fracture in past 12?months (? 1 fracture: HR = 1.7), SF-36 physical component summary score (? 42.0: HR = 1.6), and total hip T score (? ? 3.5: HR = 3.7; > ? 3.5 to ? ? 2.5: HR = 2.5; > ? 2.5 to ? ? 1: HR = 1.3).

The number of fractures was associated with posture. Severity of fracture was associated with posture when adjusting for pain. Fracture characteristics explain some variability in posture in women with a suspected vertebral fracture. Purpose: Osteoporotic vertebral fractures are associated with increased morbidity and mortality. An accumulation of vertebral fractures may lead to forward head posture, which has been independently associated with mortality. It is unclear how fracture characteristics, including the number, severity, and location of fracture, contribute to occiput-to-wall distance (OWD). Methods: This was a cross-sectional secondary data analysis using baseline data from a randomized controlled trial, in community-dwelling women aged 65?years and older with a suspected vertebral fragility fracture. Lateral thoracic and lumbar spine radiographs were used to determine the number, location, and severity of fracture. Occiput-to-wall distance (OWD) was used to assess forward head posture. Pain during movement (0–10 scale) and age were considered as confounding variables. Multivariable regression models were used to evaluate relationships between fracture variables and OWD. Results: Participants (n = 158) were of mean age 75.9 (SD 6.5) years with a mean (SD) BMI = 26.7 (5.3) kg/m 2 , OWD = 5.7 (4.6) cm, and number of fractures = 2.4 (2.4). In unadjusted analyses, the number of fractures (B = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.04, 1.59) was associated with OWD. When adjusting for pain, severity of fractures (B = 1.08, 95% CI = 0.001, 2.15) was independently associated with OWD. Location was not associated with OWD in any of the models. Conclusions: The number of fractures was significantly associated with OWD in the unadjusted model, explaining more of the variability in OWD than other fracture characteristics. Severity of fracture was associated with OWD in the adjusted model. However, pain may confound the relationship between OWD and fracture characteristics. ? 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Hyperkyphosis; Older adults; Osteoporosis; Posture; Vertebral fractures,"bone density conservation agent; aged; Article; body height; body mass; body weight; clinical practice; comorbidity; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; fragility fracture; heart disease; human; hypertension; lumbar region; lumbar spine; major clinical study; morbidity; mortality; musculoskeletal function; occiput to wall distance; osteoarthritis; osteoporosis; pain severity; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; spine fracture; treatment outcome; body position; diagnostic imaging; injury scale; lumbar vertebra; occipital bone; pathophysiology; radiography; randomized controlled trial (topic); spine fracture; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Lumbar Vertebrae; Occipital Bone; Osteoporotic Fractures; Posture; Radiography; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Spinal Fractures; Trauma Severity Indices",2-s2.0-85062421655

More importantly, there is no vaccine available against hepatitis C infection. Recent data suggest that there is a strong correlation between spontaneous HCV clearance and human NK cell function, particularly IFN-γ production. Further, IL-15 has innate antiviral activity and is also one of the main factors that activates NK cells to produce IFN-γ. To examine whether IL-15 and IFN-γ have direct antiviral activity against HCV, Huh7.5 cells were treated with either IFN-γ or IL-15 prior to HCV infection. Our data demonstrate that IFN-γ and IL-15 block HCV replication in vitro. Additionally, we show that IL-15 and IFN-γ do not induce anti-HCV effects through the type I interferon signaling pathway or nitric oxide (NO) production. Instead, IL-15 and IFN-γ provide protection against HCV via the ERK pathway. Treatment of Huh7.5 cells with a MEK/ERK inhibitor abrogated the anti-HCV effects of IL-15 and IFN-γ and overexpression of ERK1 prevented HCV replication compared to control transfection. Our in vitro data support the hypothesis that early production of IL-15 and activation of NK cells in the liver lead to control of HCV replication. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Antiviral agents; Hepatitis C; Interferon type I; Interleukin-15 (IL-15); MAP kinase signaling system; Natural killer (NK) cells,gamma interferon; interferon; interleukin 15; mitogen activated protein kinase; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; mitogen activated protein kinase inhibitor; nitric oxide; Article; controlled study; cytokine production; genetic transfection; hepatitis C; Hepatitis C virus; Huh-7.5 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; lymphocyte activation; natural killer cell; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; virus cell interaction; virus inhibition; virus replication,2-s2.0-85048761973

Characterization studies of the fibrocyte continue as does emerging conflicting data concerning the relationship to or with the lung fibroblast. The source of signals that direct the traffic of these cells, as well as their response to therapeutic intervention with newly available drugs, bring new insights to the understanding of this cell type.

Choreiform movements have a broad differential diagnosis and may present insidiously with progressive worsening of asymmetric clumsiness, hypotonia and dysarthria. The incidence of Sydenham's chorea (SC) caused by acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is very rare in developed countries. We report a previously healthy, vaccinated 9-year old male who presented to our ED with intermittent and progressive right sided clumsiness for four weeks. Physical examination findings showed dysdiadokinesis and dysmetric movements of the right side, which varied in intensity and were less pronounced on serial re-examination during the same ED visit. Basic bloodwork, MRI and MRA/V showed no abnormalities, and the patient was discharged home with urgent neurology follow-up. He re-presented to our ED four days later with worsening gait and inability to hold a pencil at school. He was subsequently diagnosed with chorea by the neurology team. The cause of chorea was later determined to be SC, and the patient's throat swab came back positive for group A-beta hemolytic strep (GAS) infection. We explore current literature regarding the various presentations of ARF, differential considerations in acute chorea, and diagnostic studies needed to determine the etiology of acute chorea. With the low incidence of chorea in developed nations, this diagnosis can be easily overlooked.

Unfortunately, the pathophysiological effects of PN are poorly understood, in part due to the lack of availability of large numbers of human sensory neurons (SNs) for study. Previous reports have demonstrated that human SNs can be directly converted from primitive CD34+ hematopoietic cells, but was limited to a small-scale product of SNs and derived exclusively from less abundant allogenic sources of cord or drug mobilized peripheral blood (PB). To address this shortcoming, we have developed and report detailed procedures toward the generation of human SN directly converted from conventionally drawn PB of adults that can be used in a high-content screening platform for discovery-based studies of chemotherapy agents on neuronal biology. In the absence of mobilization drugs, cryogenically preserved adult human PB could be induced to (i)SN via development through expandable neural precursor differentiation. iSNs could be transferable to high-throughput procedures suitable for high-content screening applicable to neuropathy for example, alterations in neurite morphology in response to chemotherapeutics. Our study provides the first reported platform using adult PB-derived iSNs to study peripheral nervous system-related neuropathies as well as target and drug screening potential for the ability to prevent, block, or repair chemotherapy-induced PN damage.

However, results of prospective randomized trials are inconsistent. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of high-dose cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) on breast tumour proliferation and apoptosis. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, phase 2, double-blinded pre-surgical window of opportunity trial. Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were randomized to receive 40,000?IU of vitamin D3 per day or placebo for 2 to 6 weeks prior to breast surgery. The primary outcome was the relative change in proliferation (Ki67) and apoptosis (cleaved caspase 3 apoptotic assay [CC3]) in primary breast cancer cells pre and post treatment. Results: Of 83 patients randomized, 80 completed the study (43 (53.8%) vitamin D and 37 (46.3%) placebo). Mean duration of drug intake was 19?days (range 9–28?days). There were no significant differences between the control arm and the vitamin D arm in percent changes of either Ki67 index (1.6% vs. 16.7%, p = 0.25) or CC3 (? 55.9% vs. ? 45.9%, p = 0.28). Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels were 3 times higher in the vitamin D arm (62?nmol/L vs. 246?nmol/L, p < 0.001). Adverse effects were minimal and all classified as grade 1.

The objective of this study was to provide guidance for authors of systematic reviews on how to identify participants with missing outcome data in reports of RCTs. Methods: Guidance statements were informed by a review of studies addressing the topic of missing data and an iterative process of feedback and refinement, through meetings involving experts in health research methodology and authors of systematic reviews. Results: The proposed guidance includes (1) definitions of key terms, (2) 19 categories of participants described in RCT reports and who might have missing data, and (3) a flowchart on how to judge the outcome data missingness for each category. The judgment of missingness relies on how trial authors report on the categories and handle them in their analyses. Practically, for their primary analysis, systematic review authors should choose how to identify participants with missing outcome data (i.e., use either “definitely missing data” or “total possible missing data”), then select a method for handling missing data in meta-analysis. Sensitivity analyses should be undertaken to explore consistency with competing options for classifying patients as having missing data. Conclusion: Adopting the proposed guidance will help promote transparency and consistency regarding how missing data are managed in systematic reviews. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Guidance; Meta-analysis; Missing data; Randomized controlled trials; Risk of bias; Systematic reviews,adult; article; decision making; female; human; male; medical research; meta analysis; outcome assessment; randomized controlled trial (topic); sensitivity analysis; systematic review,2-s2.0-85069966702

Methods: The study used data on all hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding Qu?bec) from 2003 to 2016 to examine temporal trends and from 2012 to 2016 to study regional variations. SMM was identified using diagnosis and intervention codes. Contrasts among periods and regions were quantified using rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Temporal changes were also assessed using chi-square tests for trend (Canadian Task Force Classification II-1). Results: The study population included 3 882 790 deliveries between 2003 and 2016 and 1 418 545 deliveries between 2012 and 2016. Severe hemorrhage rates increased from 44.8 in 2003 to 62.4 per 10 000 deliveries in 2012 (P for trend <0.0001) and then declined to 41.8 per 10 000 deliveries in 2016 (P for trend <0.0001).

This work is also to optimize the process responses by varying spray dry parameters for pre-screened suitable excipients; and to determine the validity of current prescreening techniques. Vaccine activity losses were measured by in vitro plaque forming assay with Vero cell line. An accelerated storage condition of 45 °C for 10 days was used to determine spray dried sample stability. Prescreening studies demonstrated that trehalose and sucrose were superior to other tested excipients spray dry thermal stabilization of HSV-2. Subsequent optimization by design of experiments (DOE) of activity responses to spray dry parameter changes demonstrated significant differences between trehalose and sucrose for stability of the viral vaccine. Model parameters included the drying conditions inlet temperature, spray gas flow rate, and solids concentration for the model responses of vaccine stabilization. Trehalose was an effective and robust stabilizing excipient for spray drying HSV-2 vaccine. In contrast, stabilization by sucrose was greatly dependent on the spray dry process parameters. These DOE differences indicated inadequate excipient selection by prescreening methods and the variability demonstrated current prescreening techniques may not be adequate for determining optimal excipients. ? 2019",DOE; Formulation; HSV-2; Optimization; Spray dry; Stabilization; Vaccine,"dextran; herpes simplex virus 2 vaccine; lactose; mannitol; sucrose; trehalose; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; excipient; sucrose; trehalose; virus vaccine; Article; comparative study; controlled study; drug storage; flow rate; gas flow; glass transition temperature; Herpes simplex virus 2; in vitro study; limit of detection; nonhuman; particle size; priority journal; spray drying; temperature sensitivity; thermostability; Vero cell line; animal; Chlorocebus aethiops; desiccation; drug formulation; drug stability; Herpes simplex virus 2; immunology; procedures; Animals; Chlorocebus aethiops; Desiccation; Drug Compounding; Drug Stability; Excipients; Herpesvirus 2, Human; Sucrose; Trehalose; Vero Cells; Viral Vaccines",2-s2.0-85070688385

Subtypes include alveolar, spindle cell, embryonal, mixed-type, pleomorphic, and rhabdomyosarcoma with ganglionic differentiation. The National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database was queried for patients diagnosed with any type of rhabdomyosarcoma between 1973 and 2014. Patient demographics, tumor characteristics, and incidence were studied with χ2 analysis. Survival was modeled with Kaplan–Meier survival curves and Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the effect of age and gender on survival. Pleomorphic subtype had higher grade and larger sized tumors compared to other subtypes (p &lt; 0.05). Pleomorphic and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma had the worst overall survival with a 26.6% and 28.9% 5-year survival, respectively. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma had the highest 5-year survival rate (73.9%). Tumor size was negatively correlated with survival months, indicating patients with larger tumors had shorter survival times (p &lt; 0.05). Presence of higher-grade tumors and metastatic disease at presentation were negatively correlated with survival months (p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences in the survival were found between gender or race between all of the subtypes (p &gt; 0.05). This study highlights key differences in the demographic and survival rates of the different types of rhabdomyosarcoma that can be used for more tailored patient counseling. We also demonstrate that large, population-level databases provide sufficient data that can be used in the analysis of rare tumors. ? 2019 Orthopaedic Research Society.

METHODS: This is a population-based study of all esophageal cancer cases diagnosed in Ontario between 2007 and 2015, including squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, with known disease stage. Other characteristics include sex, age, date of diagnosis, and treatment modalities. Treatment modalities were classified as no-treatment, radiation only or chemotherapy only, chemoradiation, and surgical resection. RESULTS: In total, 2572 patients were identified with esophageal cancer from 2007 to 2015, of which 2014 (78.3%) were male. The mean age at diagnosis was 66.6 (SD = 11.7) years. Survival rate increased over time in patients who underwent chemoradiation or surgical resection but remained unchanged for the radiation-only or chemotherapy-only group and decreased for the no-treatment group. Survival considerably improved (15-20%) for patients with stages I-III disease. CONCLUSIONS: The positive trends in the survival rate for esophageal patients could be due to adoption of multimodal therapy. Despite a lower proportion of advanced disease among patients over 80, they received less curative treatments compared with other age groups.

There have been an increasing number of N-of-1 trials for TCM published. However, a lack of preferred reporting guidance led in the general poor reporting quality of these trials. Due to the unique characteristics of TCM, the working group developed this CONSORT Extension for reporting N-of-1 Trials for Traditional Chinese Medicine (CENT for TCM) to assist TCM researchers in reporting N-of-1 trials for TCM. Methods: We registered CENT for TCM at the EQUATOR (Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research) Network (available at equator-network.org). The development was a comprehensive process through collection of the initial reporting items, two-round scientific Delphi consensus survey with 17 panelists, revision and formation of the final reporting checklist. Results: The checklist includes 25 items within six domains, eight items in which were extended and elaborated on the items of the CENT 2015 checklist.

Soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) is upregulated in endothelial dysfunction and promotes an inflammatory response; however, the relationship between sICAM-1 and VCI remains equivocal. Objective: To determine whether sICAM-1 contributes to the prediction of VCI. Methods: Community-dwelling older adults (n = 172) from the ""Cohort of Obesity, Sarcopenia and Frailty of Older Mexican Adults"" (COSFOMA) study were identified as VCI or controls using standard neuropsychological evaluations and neuroimaging. sICAM-1 was quantified using ELISA, and multivariate logistic regression determined the association between sICAM-1 and VCI. Results: A total of 31 VCI cases were identified. sICAM-1 was higher in VCI (VCI: 450.7 [241.6] ng/mL vs. controls: 296.9 [140.9] ng/mL). sICAM-1 concentrations above the 90th percentile (464.1 ng/mL) were associated with VCI group membership in all models (OR: 6.9, 95% CI: 1.1-42.2). The final saturated model explained 64% of the variance in VCI group membership. Conclusion: High concentrations of sICAM-1 are independently associated with VCI group membership. Efforts to further characterize the relationship between indices of endothelial dysfunction and pathological changes to the aging brain should be further pursued. ? 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

Despite the heritability of this disorder, few studies have assessed potential differences in the clinical manifestation of PBD among patients with a clear parental history of BD. Additionally, while recent studies suggest that attentional deficits are a potential endophenotypic marker of PBD, it is unclear whether heritability is a relevant contributor to these symptoms. In order to address this gap, the present study assessed 61 youth with PBD (6–17 years old), corresponding to 27 offspring of BD patients, and 31 PBD patients without a parental history of the disorder. All standardized assessments, including the K-SADS-PL-W were performed by trained child and adolescent psychiatrists. We performed a logistic multivariate model using the variables of ADHD, rapid cycling, and lifetime psychosis. Rates of ADHD comorbidity were significantly higher among PBD patients who had a parent with BD. Furthermore, PBD patients who had a parent with BD showed a trend toward significance of earlier symptom onset. PBD offspring did not show increased rates of suicide attempts, rapid cycling, or psychosis.

Methods: The cost-effectiveness analysis was based on the data of 444 patients of a cluster-randomized, controlled trial, conceptualized to evaluate a collaborative DCM that aimed to optimize treatment and care in dementia. Health-care resource use, costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and incremental cost per QALY gained were measured over a 24-month time horizon. Results: DCM increased QALYs (+0.05) and decreased costs (?569) due to a lower hospitalization and a delayed institutionalization (7 months) compared with usual care. The probability of DCM being cost-effective was 88% at willingness-to-pay thresholds of 40,000 per QALY gained and higher in patients living alone compared to those not living alone (96% vs. 26%). Discussion: DCM is likely to be a cost-effective strategy in treating dementia and thus beneficial for public health-care payers and patients, especially for those living alone. ? 2019 The Authors",Alzheimer's disease; Collaborative care; Cost-effectiveness; Costs; Dementia; Dementia care management; Economic impact; Economics; Formal care; Informal care; Medical treatment; Nonmedical treatment,aged; Article; collaborative care team; controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; Delphi study; dementia; female; follow up; health care cost; health care management; health care utilization; hospitalization; human; institutionalization; major clinical study; male; priority journal; quality adjusted life year; Willingness To Pay,2-s2.0-85070312459

Also, within blended capitation, we examine differences between traditional staffing and interdisciplinary teams. Using a propensity score weighted fixed-effects specification to address selection, it is estimated that the switch to capitation leads to a short-run average of 3% fewer laboratory requisitions per patient. Patients' laboratory utilization also becomes more concentrated with the rostering physician. More importantly, using diabetes-related laboratory tests as a case study, after joining the blended model, physicians order 3% fewer inappropriate/redundant tests, and the addition of an interdisciplinary care team makes the reduction about 9%. Advances in both continuity and quality seem to be associated with blended capitation. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",capitation; inappropriate medical testing; medical laboratory utilization; patient enrollment; primary care payment models,hemoglobin A1c; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; capitation fee; child; controlled study; female; health care quality; health care utilization; hospital personnel; human; infant; laboratory test; major clinical study; male; medical fee; newborn; patient care; primary health care; primary medical care; priority journal; propensity score,2-s2.0-85069884025

Often this resistance is the result of the capture and mobilization of genes that have their origins in environmental reservoirs. Both antibiotic production and resistance are ancient and widely distributed among microbes in the environment. This deep reservoir of resistance offers the opportunity for gene flow into susceptible disease-causing bacteria. Not all resistance genes are equally successfully mobilized, and some dominate in the clinic. The differences and similarities in resistance mechanisms and associated genes among environments reveal a complex interplay between gene capture and mobilization that requires study of gene diversity and gene product function to fully understand the breadth and depth of resistance and the risk to human health. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,antibiotic agent; beta lactam antibiotic; rifamycin; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic resistome; environmental factor; gene product; genetic similarity; genetic variability; genotype environment interaction; human; nonhuman; Review,2-s2.0-85069597016

We aimed to determine whether cardiac atrophy occurs in this condition and assess its association with cardiac function, symptoms, and clinical outcomes. Methods: Treatment na?ve metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients (n = 50) were assessed prior to and 4 months after commencement of carboplatin-based palliative chemotherapy. Methods included echocardiography for left ventricular mass (LVM) and LV function [LV ejection fraction, global longitudinal strain (GLS), diastolic function], computed tomography to quantify skeletal muscle and total adipose tissue, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG-PS), validated questionnaires for dyspnoea and fatigue, plasma biomarkers, tumour response to therapy, and overall survival. Results: During 112 ± 6 days, the median change in LVM was ?8.9% [95% confidence interval (95% CI) ?10.8 to ?4.8, P < 0.001]. Quartiles of LVM loss were ?20.1%, ?12.9%, ?4.8%, and +5.5%. Losses of muscle, adipose tissue, and LVM were frequently concurrent; LVM loss > median value was associated with loss of skeletal muscle [odds ratio (OR) = 4.5, 95% CI: 1.4–14.8, P=0.01] and loss of total adipose tissue (OR = 10.0, 95% CI: 2.7–36.7, P < 0.001). LVM loss was associated with decreased GLS (OR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.9–22.7, P=0.003) but not with LV ejection fraction or diastolic function. In the population overall, plasma levels of C-reactive protein (P=0.008), high sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) (P=0.03), and galectin-3 (P=0.02) increased over time, while N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide and hs-cTnI did not change over time. C-reactive protein was the only biomarker associated with LVM loss but at the univariate level only. Independent predictors of LVM loss were prior weight loss (adjusted OR = 10.2, 95% CI: 2.2–46.9, P=0.003) and tumour progression (adjusted OR = 14.6, 95% CI: 1.4–153.9, P=0.02). LVM loss was associated with exacerbations of fatigue (OR = 6.6, 95% CI: 1.9–22.7, P=0.003), dyspnoea (OR = 9.3, 95% CI: 2.4–35.8, P<0.001), and deterioration of performance status (OR = 4.8, 95% CI: 1.3–18.3,P=0.02). Patients with concurrent loss of LVM, skeletal muscle, and fat were more likely to deteriorate in all three symptom domains and to have reduced survival (P=0.05). Conclusions: Intense LVM atrophy is associated with non-small cell lung cancer-induced cachexia. Loss of LVM was associated with emerging alterations of GLS, indicating subtle changes in left ventricular function. Longer term studies are needed to assess the full scope of cardiac atrophy and its impact. LVM atrophy arises in conjunction with losses of fat and skeletal muscle and is temporally associated with meaningful declines in performance status, worsening of fatigue, and dyspnoea, as well as poorer tumour response and decreased survival. The specific contribution of LVM atrophy to these outcomes requires further study. ? 2019 The Authors Journal of Cachexia, Sarcopenia and Muscle published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of Society on Sarcopenia, Cachexia and Wasting Disorders",Cachexia; Cancer; Cardiac atrophy; Left ventricular mass,amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; C reactive protein; carboplatin; cisplatin; galectin 3; gemcitabine; paclitaxel; pemetrexed; troponin T; vinorelbine tartrate; adipose tissue; adult; advanced cancer; Article; body weight loss; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer fatigue; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular risk; clinical outcome; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; disease association; dyspnea; female; Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale; heart function; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle hypertrophy; heart left ventricle mass; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; non small cell lung cancer; overall survival; priority journal; skeletal muscle; treatment outcome; treatment response; tumor growth,2-s2.0-85068794718

There is concern that the diet could exacerbate inflammation by modifying microbiota and short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production. We examined the effect of altering dietary FODMAP content on inflammation in preclinical inflammatory models. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were given 3% dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water for 5?days and recovered for 3?weeks (postinflammatory, n?=?12), or 5?days (positive-control, n?=?12). Following recovery, DSS-treated or control mice (negative-control, n?=?12) were randomized to 2-week low- (0.51?g/100?g total FODMAP) or high-FODMAP (4.10?g) diets. Diets mimicked human consumption containing fructose, sorbitol, galacto-oligosaccharide, and fructan. Colons were assessed for myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity and histological damage. Supernatants were generated for perforated patch-clamp recordings and cytokine measurement. Cecum contents were analyzed for microbiota, SCFA, and branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA). Data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni. Key results: Inflammatory markers were higher in the positive-control compared with negative-control and postinflammatory groups, but no differences occurred between the two diets within each treatment (MPO P?>.99, histological scores P?>.99, cytokines P?>.05), or the perforated patch-clamp recordings (P?>.05). Microbiota clustered mainly based on DSS exposure. No difference in SCFA content occurred. Higher total BCFA occurred with the low-FODMAP diet in positive-control (P?<.01) and postinflammatory groups (P?<.01). Conclusions and inferences: In this preclinical study, reducing dietary FODMAPs did not exacerbate nor mitigate inflammation. Microbiota profile changes were largely driven by inflammation rather than diet. Low FODMAP intake caused a shift toward proteolytic fermentation following inflammation. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",di-; dietary therapy; fermentable oligo-; fermentation patterns; inflammation; mono-saccharides and polyols,branched chain fatty acid; carbohydrate; casein; cellulose; chemoattractant; cytokine; fatty acid; fructan; fructose; galactose oligosaccharide; gamma interferon; interleukin 12; interleukin 13; interleukin 17; interleukin 1alpha; interleukin 1beta; interleukin 2; interleukin 5; interleukin 6; keratinocyte chemoattractant; lard; macrophage inflammatory protein 2; maltodextrin; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; myeloperoxidase; sorbitol; soybean oil; starch; sucrose; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; amino acid metabolism; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; body weight change; cecum content; colon; controlled study; diet therapy; inflammatory bowel disease; low FODMAP diet; mouse; mouse model; nonhuman; perforated patch clamp; priority journal,2-s2.0-85068710207

There are concerns about the credibility of this evidence. Higher validity may be indicated by five methodological and statistical characteristics of pivotal trial evidence that were described by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which may corroborate the reliance on a single trial alone for approval decisions. Study design: We did a metaepidemiologic evaluation of all single pivotal trials supporting FDA approval of novel drugs and therapeutic biologicals for cancers between 2000 and 2016. For each trial, we determined the presence of these five characteristics, which we operationalized as (1) large and multicenter trial (?200 patients; more than one center); consistent treatment benefits across (2) multiple patient subgroups (in view of FDA reviewers), (3) multiple endpoints (including overall survival, progression-free survival, response rate, health related quality of life), and (4) multiple treatment comparisons (e.g., multi-arm studies); and (5) “statistically very persuasive” results (P-values <0.00125). Results: Thirty-five of 100 approvals were based on evidence from a single pivotal trial without any further supporting evidence on beneficial effects (20 randomized controlled trials and 15 single-arm trials). The number increased substantially from one approval before 2006 to 23 after 2011. Sixty-six percent (23/35) of the trials were large multicenter trials (median 301 patients and 63 centers). Consistent effects were demonstrated across subgroups in 66% (23/35), across endpoints in 43% (15/35), and across multiple comparisons in 3% (1/35). Very low P-values for the primary endpoint were seen in 34% (12/35). At least one of the corroborating characteristics was present in 94% (33/35) of all approvals, two or more were present in 54% (19/35), and none had all characteristics. Conclusions: Single pivotal trials typically have some of the corroborating characteristics, but often only one or two. These characteristics need to be better operationalized, defined, and reported and whether single trials with such characteristics provide similar evidence about benefits and harms of novel treatments as multiple trials would do needs to be shown. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Cancer; Confirmatory evidence; Drug approval; FDAMA section 115a; Metaresearch; Single pivotal trial; U.S. food and drug administration,antineoplastic agent; biological product; orphan drug; Article; clinical trial (topic); drug approval; drug marketing; Food and Drug Administration; human; multicenter study (topic); overall survival; priority journal; progression free survival; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); treatment response; validity,2-s2.0-85068570160

Method: We conducted a secondary analysis of 2008 to 2013 data from the Toronto, Canada, site of the At Home/Chez Soi study. Using police administrative data, we calculated the number and types of police interactions, the proportion of charges for acts of living and administration of justice, and the proportion of occurrences due to victimization, involuntary psychiatric assessment, and suicidal behavior. Using generalized estimating equations, we estimated the odds of police interaction by housing status. Results: This study included 547 adults with mental illness who were homeless at baseline. In the year prior to randomization, 55.8% of participants interacted with police, while 51.7% and 43.0% interacted with police in Study Years 1 and 2, respectively. Of 2,228 charges against participants, 12.6% were due to acts of living and 21.2% were for administration of justice. Of 518 occurrences, 41.1% were for victimization, 45.6% were for mental health assessment, and 22.2% were for suicidal behavior. The odds of any police interaction during the past 90 days was 47% higher for those who were homeless compared to those who were stably housed (95% CI 1.26 to 1.73). Conclusions: For people who experience homelessness and mental illness in Toronto, Canada, interactions with police are common. The provision of stable housing and changes in policy and practice could decrease harms and increase health benefits associated with police interactions for this population. ?

Mindfulness treatments may improve attentional control;?however, findings in youth populations?to date have been mixed. Neural measures of attentional control may be more sensitive to treatment effects, but have been rarely employed. We addressed this limitation by examining the impact of a 20-week mindfulness martial arts training program for youth aged 11–17?years with LD and mental health challenge on electroencephalography (EEG), parent-report, and behavioral indices of attention. Methods: At pre- and post-treatment, a sample of 48 youth receiving treatment and 38 waitlisted controls completed two attention tasks while EEG was recorded. Task performance and P3 amplitude and latency from EEG data were calculated. Parent-reported attention was also measured. Results: Findings varied depending on the type of measure. Controlling for pre-treatment levels of attention, significant post-treatment group differences were indicated on parent-reported attention and P3 amplitude for one attention task, with significant gains noted for the treatment but not the control group. Significant gains identified were maintained at 3-month follow-up for the treatment group. No significant post-treatment group differences were found for P3 latency or task performance measures. Conclusions: Mindfulness-based martial arts training appears to significantly impact some, but not all, indices of attentional control. Further research using a randomized control trial design with an exercise-only control is warranted.

As a result, physicians are ill-equipped to consider costs. This study sought input from practicing physicians on perceived deficiencies in current teaching and recommendations for necessary content to include in medical teaching. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews utilizing a purposeful maximum variation sample of cardiologists and neonatologists practicing in diverse settings. We analyzed interviews using conventional content analysis. 18 cardiologists and 17 neonatologists participated in this study. Respondents perceived that current teaching does not impart sufficient knowledge of value and cost considerations to achieve patient-centered, high-value decision-making. They identified the following priority areas for education related to healthcare costs: the business of medicine and information about out-of-pocket patient costs, training in health research interpretation skills to critically appraise evidence, and communication skills to engage patients as partners in shared decision-making. Participants recommended a variety of teaching methods, including didactic sessions on core topics, role modeling and case studies. American physicians perceive learning needs related to the incorporation of costs into clinical decision-making that can inform curriculum development initiatives in this field.

Results: Twelve articles were included in the final review. Studies focused on patients with diagnoses of diabetes, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. Factors influencing the design and delivery of programs focused on patient characteristics (such as disease prognosis, time since diagnosis, social determinants of health, health literacy, and proficiency with online/computer-based technologies). Conclusions: Blended learning self-management programs should consider the suitability of programs in light of health conditions and patient characteristics. Individual patient needs can be identified through clinician-driven assessments, including collaborative goal setting and the selection of pertinent educational tools.

Typically, the notes are handwritten on paper; however, electronic suicide notes have been reported with increasing frequency. This emerging phenomenon remains generally under-researched. The aim of this study was to compare the psychosocial and clinical antecedents of suicide decedents who left E-notes with those who left paper notes or no notes. Method: The study was embedded in the Southwestern Ontario Suicide Study (SOSS). The SOSS was a three-year case series of consecutive deaths by suicide that occurred in the region between 2012 and 2014. Data on psychosocial and clinical antecedents were collected with a modified version of the Manchester questionnaire used in the UK. Results: Of the 476 suicides files reviewed, 45.8% contained a suicide note. A total of 383 separate suicide notes were left: 74.3% were paper notes and 25.7% were E-notes. The results of the multivariate regression analyses indicate that the likelihood of leaving a suicide note was negatively associated with a history of admissions to a mental health unit, while the likelihood of leaving an E-note was negatively associated with age, positively associated with presence of a mental disorder, and negatively associated with history of hospital admissions. Conclusions: Future studies with larger samples need to consider the timing of the text messages, and appraise whether there was the intent of seeking help or rescue in the text messages. ? 2018 The American Association of Suicidology",,,2-s2.0-85054163171

Objective: To evaluate the current state of CKD management in Canadian primary care practices to identify care gaps to guide development and implementation of national quality improvement initiatives. Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional study leveraged Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network data from January 1, 2010, to December 31, 2015, to develop a cohort of 46?162 patients with CKD managed in primary care practices. Data analysis was performed from August 8, 2018, to July 31, 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The study examined the proportion of patients with CKD who met a set of 12 quality indicators in 6 domains: (1) detection and recognition of CKD, (2) testing and monitoring of kidney function, (3) use of recommended medications, (4) monitoring after initiation of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), (5) management of blood pressure, and (6) monitoring for glycemic control in those with diabetes and CKD. The study also analyzed associations of divergence from these quality indicators. Results: The cohort comprised 46?162 patients (mean [SD] age, 69.2 [14.0] years; 25 855 [56.0%] female) with stage 3 to 5 CKD. Only 4 of 12 quality indicators were met by 75% or more of the study cohort. These indicators were receipt of an outpatient serum creatinine test within 18 months after confirmation of CKD, receipt of blood pressure measurement at any time during follow-up, achieving a target blood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or lower, and receiving a hemoglobin A1c test for monitoring diabetes during follow-up. Indicators in the domains of detection and recognition of CKD, testing and monitoring of kidney function (specifically, urine albumin to creatinine ratio testing), use of recommended medications, and appropriate monitoring after initiation of treatment with ACEIs or ARBs were not met. Only 6529 patients (18.4%) with CKD received a urine albumin test within 6 months of CKD diagnosis, and 3954 (39.4%) had a second measurement within 6 months of an abnormal baseline urine albumin level. Older age (?85 years) and CKD stage 5 were significantly associated with not satisfying the criteria for the quality indicators across all domains. Across age categories, younger patients (aged 18-49 years) and older patients (?75 years) were less likely to be tested for albuminuria (314 of 1689 patients aged 18-49 years [18.5%], 1983 of 11 919 patients aged 75-84 years [61.6%], and 614 of 5237 patients aged ?85 years [11.7%] received the urine albumin to creatinine ratio test within 6 months of initial estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 mL/min per 1.73 m2; P?<?.001). Patients aged 18 to 49 years were less commonly prescribed recommended medications (222 of 2881 [7.7%]), whereas patients aged 75 to 84 years were prescribed ACEIs or ARBs most frequently (2328 of 5262 [44.2%]; P?<?.001). Conclusions and Relevance: The findings suggest that management of CKD across primary care practices in Canada varies according to quality indicator.

DESIGN: Qualitative longitudinal study in which men living with HIV were interviewed on four occasions over 20 months. SETTING: Men were recruited from HIV community organisations in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: 14 men with a median age of 57.5 years and median time since diagnosis of 21.5 years. RESULTS: Five themes depict the living strategies used to deal with the episodic nature of disability and uncertainty over time. Actively engaging in problem-solving by prioritising and modifying activities and avoiding stress, advocating for support, being positive and future oriented, engaging in healthy pursuits and providing social support to others helped men to mitigate their disability. By following participants over time, we were able to gather insights into triggers of episodes of disability, and perceptions of the success of implementing their living strategies and avoiding uncertainty. CONCLUSIONS: Participants used living strategies to deal with uncertainty and mitigate episodes of disability over time. This study supports the importance of programmes that promote self-management for older men living with HIV through helping them identify triggers of disability, set realistic goals and problem-solve. These may help build self-efficacy, increase sense of control, and decrease feelings of uncertainty and episodes of disability. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019.

Travellers are at high risk for acquiring infections while abroad and potentially bringing these infections back to their home country. There are many ways to mitigate this risk by seeking pre-travel advice (PTA), including receiving recommended vaccinations and chemoprophylaxis, however many travellers do not seek or adhere to PTA. We conducted a systematic review to further understand PTA-seeking behaviour with an ultimate aim to implement interventions that improve adherence to PTA and reduce morbidity and mortality in travellers. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published medical literature selecting studies that examined reasons for not seeking PTA and non-adherence to PTA over the last ten years. 4484 articles were screened of which 56 studies met our search criteria after full text review. RESULTS: The major reason for not seeking or non-adherence to PTA was perceived low risk of infection while travelling. Side effects played a significant role for lack of adherence specific to malaria prophylaxis. CONCLUSIONS: These data may help clinicians and public health providers to better understand reasons for non-adherence to PTA and target interventions to improve travellers understanding of potential and modifiable risks. Additionally, we discuss specific recommendations to increase public health education that may enable travellers to seek PTA. ? International Society of Travel Medicine 2019.

Design Our scoping review examined the extent of the literature on community plans to prevent and reduce opioid-related harms, characterise the key components, and identify gaps. Data sources We searched MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CINHAL, SocINDEX and Academic Search Primer, and three search engines for English language peer-reviewed and grey literature from the past 10 years. Eligibility criteria Eligible records addressed opioid-related harms or overdose, used two or more intervention approaches (eg, prevention, treatment, harm reduction, enforcement and justice), involved two or more partners and occurred in an Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country. Data extraction and synthesis Qualitative thematic and quantitative analysis was conducted on the charted data. Stakeholders were engaged through fourteen interviews, three focus groups and one workshop. results We identified 108 records that described 100 community plans in Canada and the USA; four had been evaluated. Most plans were provincially or state funded, led by public health and involved an average of seven partners. Commonly, plans used individual training to implement interventions. Actions focused on treatment and harm reduction, largely to increase access to addiction services and naloxone. Among specific groups, people in conflict with the law were addressed most frequently. Community plans typically engaged the public through in-person forums. Stakeholders identified three key implications to our findings: addressing equity and stigma-related barriers towards people with lived experience of substance use; improving data collection to facilitate evaluation; and enhancing community partnerships by involving people with lived experience of substance use. Conclusion Current understanding of the implementation and context of community opioid-related plans demonstrates a need for evaluation to advance the evidence base. Partnership with people who have lived experience of substance use is underdeveloped and may strengthen responsive public health decision making. ?

We aim to assess the relationship between dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced MR perfusion (DSC-MRP) and overall survival to establish a baseline for future research and to determine the utility of DSC-MRP as a clinical decision-making and prognostic tool.Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Adults with pathologically confirmed HGG at the Juravinski Cancer Centre, Ontario between January 2011 and April 2014 with at least one post-treatment DSC-MRP were included. DSC-MRP was interpreted as positive or negative for tumor recurrence by experienced radiologists. The primary outcome was overall survival.Results: Sixty-one patients were enrolled. Median survival for patients with a positive DSC-MRP scan was 4.5 months compared with 10.2 months for those with a negative DSC-MRP scan (hazard ratio [unadjusted] = 2.51; 95% confidence interval = 1.10-5.67; p-value = 0.03). Multivariable modeling (adjusted) that included all pre-selected variables showed similar results.Conclusion: Survival time in patients with HGG is generally low, and almost all patients will demonstrate RT. Our data suggest a positive DSC-MRP correlates with lower overall survival and may signify the presence of highly active RT. These results generate a hypothesis that there may be a prognostic role for the use of serial DSC-MRP for tumor surveillance. More importantly, this biomarker may aid in decision making for treatment plans and palliation. ? 2019 The Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences Inc.",Cerebral blood volume; Glioma; MR perfusion; Tumor imaging,gadobutrol; adult; Article; cancer recurrence; cancer survival; cohort analysis; contrast enhancement; controlled study; dynamic susceptibility contrast enhanced magnetic resonance perfusion; female; glioma; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; salvage therapy; survival time,2-s2.0-85071899472

We aimed to identify causal blood biomarkers linking favorable adiposity with type 2 diabetes risk for use in cardiometabolic risk assessments. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A weighted polygenic risk score (PRS) underpinning metabolically favorable adiposity was validated in the UK Biobank (n = 341,872) and the Outcome Reduction With Initial Glargine Intervention (ORIGIN Trial) (n = 8,197) and tested for association with 238 blood biomarkers. Associated biomarkers were investigated for causation with type 2 diabetes risk using Mendelian randomization and for its performance in predictive models for incident major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). RESULTS Of the 238 biomarkers tested, only insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-3 concentration was associated with the PRS, where a 1 unit increase in PRS predicted a 0.28-SD decrease in IGFBP-3 blood levels (P < 0.05/238). Higher IGFBP-3 levels causally increased type 2 diabetes risk (odds ratio 1.26 per 1 SD genetically determined IGFBP-3 level [95% CI 1.11-1.43]) and predicted a higher incidence of MACE (hazard ratio 1.13 per 1 SD IGFBP-3 concentration [95% CI 1.07-1.20]). Adding IGFBP-3 concentrations to the standard clinical assessment of metabolic health enhanced the prediction of incident MACE, with a net reclassification improvement of 11.5% in normal weight individuals (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS We identified IGFBP-3 as a novel biomarker linking a lack of favorable adiposity with type 2 diabetes risk and a predictive marker for incident cardiovascular events. Using IGFBP-3 blood concentrations may improve the risk assessment of cardiometabolic diseases. ? 2019 by the American Diabetes Association.",,biological marker; chemokine; leptin; pepsinogen I; somatomedin binding protein 3; transcription factor RUNX2; adult; Article; biobank; cohort analysis; disease association; disease classification; genetic risk score; human; incidence; major adverse cardiac event; major clinical study; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; prospective study; protein blood level; risk assessment; risk factor; United Kingdom,2-s2.0-85071639136

Wiseman's work on the King's-Evil provides an interesting window through which the political expediency of the monarch's thaumaturgic touch may be explored. The dependence of the thaumaturgic touch on liturgy, theatricality and its inherent political economy in Restoration England allowed Wiseman to appropriate the traditionally monarchical role of healer as his own, by drawing attention to a medical ritual of healing that was as reliant, just as the theatrical ritual of monarchical thaumaturgy was, on symbolic binaries of healer-healed, head-body and touch-sight. ? 2019 Author(s).",infectious diseases; literature and medicine; medical humanities; metaphor; physician narratives,"England; history; human; literature; politics; tuberculous lymphadenitis; England; History, 17th Century; Humans; King's Evil; Medicine in Literature; Politics",2-s2.0-85071370458

The uneven distribution of benefits and harms is a primary consequence of settler colonialism. Indeed, it is a central organizing feature of the settler state's governance of Indigenous societies and is animated, in part, through pervasive settler ignorance and anti-Indigenous racism, which has manifested in persistent health disparities amongst Indigenous peoples. This broader socio-political context surrounding medical schools, which are seeking to develop teaching and learning about Indigenous health presents a significant challenge. Understanding the cognitive and affective tools that settler educators use when grappling with questions of race, racialization, and Indigenous difference is an important step in addressing anti-Indigenous racism in health care provision. This paper reports on findings from in-depth semi-structured interviews with educators at one Canadian medical school. Our intent was to elicit respondents' understandings, experiences, and attitudes regarding Indigenous-settler relations, Indigenous health and healthcare, and the inclusion of Indigenous health in the curriculum as a means of identifying facilitators and barriers to improving Indigenous health and health care experiences. Respondents were generally sympathetic and evinced an earnest desire to include more Indigenous-related content in the curriculum. What became clear over the course of the data collection and analysis, however, was that most respondents lacked the tools to engage critically with questions of race and racialization and how these are manifested in the context of asymmetrical settler colonial power. We argue that this inability, at best, limits the effectiveness of much needed efforts to incorporate more content relating to Indigenous health, but worse yet, risks re-entrenching anti-Indigenous racism and settler dominance. ? 2019",anti-Indigenous racism; Indigenous health; Medical education; Multiculturalism; Qualitative inquiry; Settler colonialism; Truth and reconciliation commission of Canada,colonialism; health care; health education; indigenous population; multiculturalism; racism; survey method; teaching; adult; article; Canada; colonialism; cultural diversity; curriculum; female; geography; human; human experiment; learning; male; medical education; medical school; racism; semi structured interview; Canada; Dudleya edulis,2-s2.0-85070607997

Human misuse of antimicrobials exacerbates the issue. As stewards to the public and prescribers of antimicrobials, healthcare providers are vital to reducing AMR, thus their perceptions and experiences around the issue must be explored. This study aimed to understand the perceptions of community nurses and physicians regarding the causes of AMR as well as barriers and facilitators to addressing it. Methods: In-depth, semi-structured interviews were conducted to understand the perceptions of nurses and physicians on these issues. Results: Overall, participants expressed that both environmental and human causes at various levels contribute to AMR. Whilst most themes were discussed by both healthcare practitioner groups, nurses more frequently mentioned patient causes and patient education compared with physicians. Participants also reflected on facilitators to reduce AMR, including guidelines, patient and provider education, and top-down and bottom-up initiatives. Identified barriers included patient demands, physician pressures and fears, and systemic overworking of physicians. Conclusion: This study demonstrated numerous factors underpinning AMR and many barriers to addressing it, hence a multifaceted approach is required.

An intrauterine ring and tandem applicator is used for intracavitary brachytherapy. The dose is prescribed to the high-risk clinical target volume. The goals of this study were to investigate the stability of intracavitary applicator placement during patient transfer and to evaluate the dosimetric impact of displacement. Methods: Fourteen patients with cervical cancer were analyzed. Three sets of orthogonal fluoroscopic radiographs were obtained in the high-dose-rate suite after the insertion and before treatment: pre–computed tomography (CT) fluoroscopic radiograph with patient in the lithotomy position, pre-CT fluoroscopic radiograph with patient in the legs down position, and post-CT fluoroscopic radiograph with patient in the legs down position. Applicator position after CT was compared with the pre-CT radiographs to determine if the position changed during patient transfer. The displacement was measured in the anterior-posterior, medio-lateral, and superior-inferior directions, as well as the degree of pitch, roll, and yaw. To study the impact of applicator shifts on dose to organs at risk (OARs), the ring and tandem applicator was shifted virtually in the BrachyVision treatment planning system. The OARs studied included the small bowel, sigmoid colon, rectum, and bladder. Five millimeter shifts were made in the superior-inferior, medio-lateral, and anterior-posterior direction. Three degree rotations were made in the pitch, yaw, and roll directions. Applicator shifts were analyzed in only one direction at a time. The dosimetric impact on OARs was evaluated by comparing the original and shifted/rotated plans to dose-volume histogram–based criteria. Results: The average displacements were 1.9 ± 0.5 mm laterally, 3.0 ± 0.6 mm longitudinally, and 9.5 ± 1.5 mm anterior-posterior. The average applicator rotation on the posterior-anterior radiograph was 1.0 ± 0.2° and 2.6 ± 0.6° on the lateral radiograph. Five millimeter anterior-posterior shifts had the greatest effect on dose to OARs. On average, 5 mm anterior shifts had the greatest effect on the small bowel dose, where there was a 13.7% (79.6 cGy) increase in D2cc. Five millimeter anterior shifts also affected bladder dose, with a 36.5% (141.1 cGy) increase in D2cc. Five millimeter POST shifts increased the rectal D2cc by 28.6% (168.7 cGy). Other directional shifts had negligible effects on dose. The largest effect on OAR dose arising from rotations was to the sigmoid colon, when the applicator rotated in the POST pitch direction. As a result, the dose increased by 4.7% (7.6 cGy). All other rotations had minimal impact on OAR doses. Conclusion: Patient transfer resulted in applicator shifts and rotations that had a measurable effect on dose to OARs. The displacements were the result of either a direct shift or rotation of the applicator. Additional tracking of these shifts and rotations may clarify the sources of these unwanted motions and suggest possible mitigation strategies. ? 2019",cervix; Displacement; HDR brachytherapy; organs at risk; ring; tandem,Article; bladder; brachytherapy; clinical article; clinical target volume; computer assisted tomography; dose volume histogram; dosimetry; external beam radiotherapy; female; fluoroscopy; human; lithotomy position; patient transport; priority journal; radiation dose fractionation; rectum; retrospective study; sigmoid; small intestine; uterine cervix cancer; uterine cervix carcinoma,2-s2.0-85068786065

This study evaluated patient and caregiver factors associated with the development of these symptoms. Methods: This study used the Rehabilitation and Recovery in Patients after Critical Illness and Their Family Caregivers (RECOVER) Program (Phase 1) cohort of 391 patients from 10 medical/surgical university-affiliated ICUs across Canada. We determined the association between patient depressive symptoms (captured by using the Beck Depression Inventory II [BDI-II]), patient characteristics (age, sex, socioeconomic status, Charlson score, and ICU length of stay [LOS]), functional independence measure (FIM) motor subscale score, and caregiver characteristics (Caregiver Assistance Scale and Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale) by using linear mixed models at time points 3, 6, and 12 months. Results: BDI-II data were available for 246 patients. Median age at ICU admission was 56 years (interquartile range, 45-65 years), 143 (58%) were male, and median ICU LOS was 19 days (interquartile range, 13-32 days). During the 12-month follow-up, 67 of 246 (27.2%) patients had a BDI-II score ? 20, indicating moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Mixed models showed worse depressive symptoms in patients with lower FIM motor subscale scores (1.1 BDI-II points per 10 FIM points), lower income status (by 3.7 BDI-II points; P =.007), and incomplete secondary education (by 3.8 BDI-II points; P =.009); a curvilinear relation with age (P =.001) was also reported, with highest BDI-II at ages 45 to 50 years. No associations were found between patient BDI-II and comorbidities (P =.92), sex (P =.25), ICU LOS (P =.51), or caregiver variables (Caregiver Assistance Scale [P =.28] and Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale [P =.74]). Conclusions: Increased functional dependence, lower income, and lower education are associated with increased severity of post-ICU depressive symptoms, whereas age has a curvilinear relation with symptom severity. Knowledge of risk factors may inform surveillance and targeted mental health follow-up.

The current study examined the association of central and peripheral body fat distribution and low-grade inflammation levels in young adults, considering collinearity between variables. Methods and results: A cross-sectional analysis of 809 adults (aged 27 years) was conducted as part of the EPITeen cohort, Porto, Portugal. Regional body fat was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scan (DXA) and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) was measured in a fasting blood sample. OLS (ordinary least squares) and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression models were fitted to estimate the association of trunk and peripheral fat with hsCRP, stratified by sex. Using OLS regression, trunk fat in females was positively associated with ln(hsCRP) (β1 = 0.064, 95% CI 0.018; 0.109). The effect of peripheral fat on ln(hsCRP) was shown not to be significantly different from trunk fat (β2 = ?0.011, 95% CI ?0.110; 0.089), but no statistically significant association was observed (β3 = 0.053, 95% CI ?0.004; 0.110) between peripheral fat and ln(hsCRP). In males, trunk fat also showed a positive association with ln(hsCRP) (β1 = 0.104, 95% CI 0.055; 0.154), and the effect of peripheral fat on ln(hsCRP) was shown to be significantly different from trunk fat (β2 = ?0.124, 95% CI ?0.237;?0.011). However, the association between peripheral fat and ln(hsCRP) did not reach statistical significance (β3 = ?0.020, 95% CI ?0.086; 0.046). The results of OLS were confirmed by LASSO regression.

Medical students will form habits during training that they are likely to maintain as future physicians. The overall purpose of this study was to investigate the underlying mechanism(s)contributing to frequency in recommending physical activity, to provide insight into how we can increase physical activity recommendations in future practice as physicians. First to fourth year medical students at three Canadian universities responded to an online survey (N = 221; 12% response rate)between November 2017 and January 2018. Results revealed that engaging in strenuous physical activity was a strong predictor for frequency in recommending physical activity to patients (p <.001). Confidence in recommending physical activity mediated the relationship between strenuous physical activity and frequency recommending physical activity (p =.005); motivation did not mediate this relationship. Students were more motivated, than they were confident, to assess, advise, counsel, prescribe and refer patients regarding physical activity (p <.05). While 70% of students stated they are aware of the Canadian physical activity guidelines, only 52% accurately recalled them. Findings suggest that increased training related to physical activity should be included in the medical school curriculum to increase students' confidence to recommend physical activity. Another way to increase confidence and frequency in recommending physical activity is to help students engage in more strenuous physical activity themselves, which will ultimately benefit both medical students and their future patients. ? 2019",Medical students; Physical activity prescription; Preventive medicine,adult; article; curriculum; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical school; medical student; motivation; physical activity; physician; practice guideline; prescription; preventive medicine,2-s2.0-85067990400

Study Design and Setting: We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and WorldCat up to March 2018 for publications providing guidance for assessing the credibility of effect modification identified in randomized trials or meta-analyses. Teams of two investigators independently identified eligible publications and extracted credibility criteria and authors’ rationale, reaching consensus through discussion. We created a taxonomy of criteria that we iteratively refined during data abstraction. Results: We identified 150 eligible publications that provided 36 criteria and associated rationales. Frequent criteria included significant test for interaction (n = 54), a priori hypothesis (n = 49), providing a causal explanation (n = 47), accounting for multiplicity (n = 45), testing a small number of effect modifiers (n = 38), and prespecification of analytic details (n = 39). For some criteria, we found more than one rationale; some criteria were connected through a common rationale. For some criteria, experts disagreed regarding their suitability (e.g., added value of stratified randomization; trustworthiness of biologic rationales).

Convergent evidence indicates that overweight/obesity (OW), a highly prevalent condition in MDD, is independently associated with reward disturbances. We therefore aimed to investigate the moderating effect of OW on the willingness to expend efforts for reward in individuals with MDD and healthy controls (HC). Methods: Forty-one adults (HC n = 20, MDD n = 21) completed the Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), clinical and cognitive measures. Anthropometric parameters were assessed in all participants, and an additional evaluation of laboratorial parameters were conducted solely on those with MDD. Individuals with MDD were all on vortioxetine monotherapy (10–20 mg/day). Results: Interactions between reward magnitude, group and OW were observed (χ2 = 9.192, p = 0.010); the OW-MDD group chose the hard task significantly less than normal weight (NW)-HC (p = 0.033) and OW-HC (p = 0.034), whereas there were no differences between NW-MDD and HCs. Within individuals with MDD, the proportion of hard task choices was more strongly correlated with body mass index (BMI) (r = ?0.456, p = 0.043) and insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR) (r = ?0.467, p = 0.038), than with depressive symptoms (r = 0.290, p = 0.214). Conclusions: OW significantly moderated the association between MDD and willingness to make efforts for rewards.

Further, I consider whether health behaviors and psychosocial processes lead to higher psychological distress for childhood immigrants in adulthood. Cross-sectional data from the Canadian Community Health Survey-Mental Health 2012 (N = 4282) reveal that compared to adult immigrants, childhood immigrants are not only four times more likely to use drugs, but also experience greater interpersonal strain. However, health behaviors such as these contribute less to psychological distress than do psychosocial resources. Additionally, longer duration of migration is found to reduce psychological distress when controlling for age at migration, thus suggesting the migrant health literature should examine age-salient life challenges at the time of migration, instead of continuing to use duration of migration as a proxy for negative acculturation. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Health behavior; Immigrants; Psychological distress; Psychosocial resources; Stress process model,,2-s2.0-85064668665

The use of diabetes risk assessment tools could identify those at risk, leading to prevention or early detection of diabetes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the appropriateness of 6 existing T2DM risk screening tools in detecting dysglycemia in Zamboanga City, Philippines. Methods: This study used a case-control design in an urban setting in the southern Philippines. There were 200 participants in two groups: 1) those diagnosed with diabetes (n = 50; recruited from diabetes clinics) and 2) those with no previous diagnosis of diabetes (n = 150; recruited from community locations). Participants completed six tools (the Finnish Diabetes Risk Score [FINDRISC], the Canadian Diabetes Risk Score [CANRISK], the Indian Diabetes Risk Score [IDRS], the American Diabetes Association [ADA] risk score, an Indonesian undiagnosed diabetes mellitus [UDDM] scoring system, and a Filipino tool). Scores were compared to fasting plasma glucose levels, which are recommended in Philippines clinical practice guidelines as a valid, available, and low cost option for T2DM diagnosis. Appropriateness of tools was determined through accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative predictive value (PPV, NPV), and positive/negative likelihood ratios. Results: The Filipino tool had the highest specificity (0.73) and PPV (0.27), but lowest sensitivity (0.68). The IDRS and Indonesian UDDM tool had the highest NPV at 0.96, but were not amongst the highest in other scores. The CANRISK tied for highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), AUC (0.80), but other scores were not noteworthy. Overall, the FINDRISC was the most effective with highest sensitivity (0.94), tied for highest AUC (0.80), and with middle scores in other variables (specificity: 0.45, PPV: 0.20, NPV: 0.95), when using the published cut-off score of 9. When increasing the cut-off score to 11, specificity increased (0.71) and sensitivity was not greatly affected (0.86). Conclusions: Our results suggest that the FINDRISC is more suitable than other known diabetes risk assessment tools in an urban Filipino population; effectiveness increased with a higher cut-off score. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Diabetes risk assessment tools; Evaluation; Low- to middle-income countries (LMICs); Philippines; Prevention; Type 2 diabetes,"adult; case control study; female; human; male; mass screening; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Philippines; procedures; risk assessment; sensitivity and specificity; urban population; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Humans; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Philippines; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity; Urban Population",2-s2.0-85071517856

The sample included 15,799 participants aged 2–26?years. Asthma was defined as diagnosis by a health professional as having asthma, having wheezing or whistling in the chest, or use of medication for asthma. Results: Prevalence of asthma (defined as a combination of any three factors) was lower in first-generation (32%) and second-generation (34%) immigrants compared with non-immigrants (46%).

The programme launched in 2015 across two community settings in England, with an independent evaluation led by King’s College London. This paper aims to (1) summarise the process of developing For Baby’s Sake and how it has been embedded within two different settings and (2) describe the evaluation design using early data to illustrate successes and challenges. The programme was developed following a review of the evidence and extensive stakeholder engagement. Three experts co-designed the content in partnership with the Stefanou Foundation and the programme delivery teams have been integrated into two local authorities. The evaluation uses mixed methods to assess abuse victimisation/perpetration, mental health, parenting and child outcomes, alongside service user experiences of early engagement. Forty individuals (27 women and 13 men) have been recruited to the evaluation. Early findings suggest that parents value the novel approach of For Baby’s Sake and their relationships with practitioners. Data on parents’ mental health and childhood adversities supports the decision to create a trauma-informed intervention. Interventions for domestic abuse are necessary to improve health and behaviour outcomes for families and prevent intergenerational transmission of abuse and developmental trauma. For Baby’s Sake addresses limitations of existing interventions, through its trauma-informed, attachment-based, whole-family approach. Early data from the evaluation suggests that the programme is reaching its intended audience and that service users appreciate the supportive approach. ? 2019, The Author(s).",Domestic abuse; Intervention; Psychological treatment; Trauma,,2-s2.0-85060676045

Despite numerous studies on the topic, the absolute risk in patients with a positive family history remains unclear and therefore studies are lacking to validate non-invasive screening methods in individuals with positive family history. AIM To quantify the risk of colorectal cancer in individuals with a positive family history. METHODS A comprehensive electronic literature search was performed using PubMed from January 1955 until November 2017, EMBASE from 1947 until 2018, and Cochrane Library without date restrictions. Two independent reviewers conducted study selection, data extraction and quality assessment. A meta-analysis of Mantel- Haenzel relative risks was performed using the random effects model. Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to score the quality of selected papers. Funnel plot and Egger's regression test was performed to detect publication bias. Subgroup analysis was performed comparing Asian and non-Asian studies. Sensitivity analyses were performed to rule out the effect of the timing of the study, overall quality, the main outcome and the effect of each individual study in overall result. RESULTS Forty-six out of 3390 studies, including 906981 patients were included in the final analysis. 41 of the included studies were case-control and 5 were cohort. A positive family history of colorectal cancer in first-degree relatives was associated with significantly increased risk of colorectal cancer with a relative risk of 1.87 (95%CI: 1.68-2.09; P < 0.00001). Cochrane Q test was significant (P < 0.00001, I2 = 90%). Egger's regression test showed asymmetry in the funnel plot and therefore the Trim and Fill method was used which confirmed the validity of the results. There was no difference between Asian versus non-Asian studies. Results remained robust in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION Individuals with a positive family history of colorectal cancer are 1.87 times more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Screening guidelines should pay specific attention to individuals with positive family history and further studies need to be done on validating current screening methods or developing new modalities in this high-risk population. ?

Among a limited number of genes that are frequently mutated in MPM several of them encode proteins that belong to the HIPPO tumor suppressor pathway. Methods: The anticancer effects of the top flower standardized extract of Filipendula vulgaris (Dropwort) were characterized in ""in vitro"" and ""in vivo"" models of MPM. At the molecular level, two ""omic"" approaches were used to investigate Dropwort anticancer mechanism of action: a metabolomic profiling and a phosphoarray analysis. Results: We found that Dropwort significantly reduced cell proliferation, viability, migration and in vivo tumor growth of MPM cell lines. Notably, Dropwort affected viability of tumor-initiating MPM cells and synergized with Cisplatin and Pemetrexed in vitro. Metabolomic profiling revealed that Dropwort treatment affected both glycolysis/tricarboxylic acid cycle as for the decreased consumption of glucose, pyruvate, succinate and acetate, and the lipid metabolism. We also document that Dropwort exerted its anticancer effects, at least partially, promoting YAP and TAZ protein ubiquitination. Conclusions: Our findings reveal that Dropwort is a promising source of natural compound(s) for targeting the HIPPO pathway with chemo-preventive and anticancer implications for MPM management. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cancer metabolism; HIPPO tumour suppressor pathway; Mesothelioma; Phytonutrient; YAP,"antineoplastic agent; cisplatin; Filipendula vulgaris extract; pemetrexed; plant extract; transcription factor; transcription factor TAZ; transcription factor TEAD; transcription factor Yap1; unclassified drug; cell cycle protein; plant extract; protein binding; TAZ protein, human; transcription factor; YY1AP1 protein, human; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; Article; cancer inhibition; cell cycle arrest; cell viability; controlled study; drug mechanism; drug potentiation; drug targeting; female; Filipendula; Filipendula vulgaris; flower; hippo signaling; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; lipid metabolism; mesothelioma; metabolic fingerprinting; microarray analysis; migration inhibition; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; ubiquitination; animal; cell motion; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; energy metabolism; lung tumor; mesothelioma; metabolism; pathology; tumor cell line; Animals; Cell Cycle Proteins; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Movement; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Disease Models, Animal; Energy Metabolism; Filipendula; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Mesothelioma; Mice; Plant Extracts; Protein Binding; Transcription Factors",2-s2.0-85070645410

Previous research has identified bird species that infect a large fraction of the total pool of infected mosquitoes and correlate with human infection risk; however, these analyses cover small spatial regions and cannot be used to predict transmission in bird communities in which these species are rare or absent. Here we present a mechanistic model for WNV transmission that predicts WNV spread (R0) in any bird community in North America by scaling up from the physiological responses of individual birds to transmission at the level of the community. We predict unmeasured bird species' responses to infection using phylogenetic imputation, based on these species' phylogenetic relationships with bird species with measured responses. Results: We focused our analysis on Texas, USA, because it is among the states with the highest total incidence of WNV in humans and is well sampled by birders in the eBird database. Spatio-temporal patterns: WNV transmission is primarily driven by temperature variation across time and space, and secondarily by bird community composition. In Texas, we predicted WNV R0 to be highest in the spring and fall when temperatures maximize the product of mosquito transmission and survival probabilities. In the most favorable months for WNV transmission (April, May, September and October), we predicted R0 to be highest in the ""Piney Woods"" and ""Oak Woods &amp; Prairies"" ecoregions of Texas, and lowest in the ""High Plains"" and ""South Texas Brush County"" ecoregions. Dilution effect: More abundant bird species are more competent hosts for WNV, and predicted WNV R0 decreases with increasing species richness. Keystone species: We predicted that northern cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) are the most important hosts for amplifying WNV and that mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) are the most important sinks of infection across Texas. Conclusions: Despite some data limitations, we demonstrate the power of phylogenetic imputation in predicting disease transmission in heterogeneous host communities. Our mechanistic modeling framework shows promise both for assisting future analyses on transmission and spillover in heterogeneous multispecies pathogen systems and for improving model transparency by clarifying assumptions, choices and shortcomings in complex ecological analyses. ? 2019 The Author(s).",American robin; Dilution effect; Flavivirus; Multiple imputation; Phylogenetic analysis; Zoonotic spillover,"Article; bird; Cardinalis cardinalis; controlled study; environmental temperature; falling; genetic heterogeneity; host pathogen interaction; incidence; nonhuman; North American; phylogeny; prediction; spatiotemporal analysis; species composition; species richness; spring; survival analysis; Texas; virus transmission; West Nile virus; Zenaida macroura; animal; biological model; bird; bird disease; epidemiology; mosquito; North America; phylogeny; physiology; season; veterinary medicine; virology; West Nile fever; West Nile virus; Animals; Bird Diseases; Birds; Citizen Science; Culicidae; Models, Biological; North America; Phylogeny; Seasons; Texas; West Nile Fever; West Nile virus",2-s2.0-85070475619

Objective: Evaluate democratic deliberations engaging minority and underserved communities in setting health research priorities. Methods: Participants from underrepresented communities throughout Michigan (47 groups, n?=?519) engaged in structured deliberations about health research priorities in professionally facilitated groups. We evaluated some aspects of the structure, process, and outcomes of deliberations, including representation, equality of participation, participants’ views of deliberations, and the impact of group deliberations on individual participants’ knowledge, attitudes, and points of view. Follow-up interviews elicited richer descriptions of these and also explored later effects on deliberators. Results: Deliberators (age 18-88?years) overrepresented minority groups. Participation in discussions was well distributed. Deliberators improved their knowledge about disparities, but not about health research. Participants, on average, supported using their group's decision to inform decision makers and would trust a process like this to inform funding decisions. Views of deliberations were the strongest predictor of these outcomes. Follow-up interviews revealed deliberators were particularly struck by their experience hearing and understanding other points of view, sometimes surprised at the group's ability to reach agreement, and occasionally activated to volunteer or advocate. Conclusions: Deliberations using a structured group exercise to engage minority and underserved community members in setting health research priorities met some important criteria for a fair, credible process that could inform policy.

Unfortunately, SVG are associated with poor long-term patency rates; a significant predictor of re-operation rates and survival. As such, medical therapy to prevent SVG narrowing or occlusion is of paramount importance. Aspirin (ASA) monotherapy is the standard of care after CABG, to improve long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and graft patency. Benefits of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) have not been well established in all CABG patients. We present a protocol for a network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing the effects of various antiplatelet therapy regimens on SVG patency, mortality, and bleeding among adult patients following CABG. METHODS: We will search CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL ACPJC, and grey literature sources (AHA, ACC, ESC, and CCC conference proceedings, ISRCTN Register, and WHO ICTRP) for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which fit our criteria. RCTs that evaluate different antiplatelet regimens at least 3-months after CABG and have any of SVG patency, mortality, MACE, and major bleeding as outcomes will be selected. We will perform title and abstract screening, full-text screening, and data extraction independently and in duplicate. Two independent reviewers will also assess risk of bias (ROB) for each study, as well as evaluate quality of evidence using the GRADE framework. We will use R to perform the NMA and use low-dose ASA as reference within our network. We will report results as odds ratios with confidence intervals for direct comparisons, and credible intervals for indirect or mixed comparisons. We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) to estimate the ranking of interventions. DISCUSSION: Given the limited direct comparison of various antiplatelet regimens, a network approach is ideal to clarify the optimum antiplatelet therapy after CABG.

We examined the genotype and allele frequencies of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency to inform decisions on primaquine use, as we recently detected clusters of Plasmodium ovale curtisi in Kavango. Methods: A multistaged cross-sectional sampling method was used to enrol 212 children 2-9 y of age from schools and clinics in the Okavango and Zambezi regions of northern Namibia. Genotypes for the 202 G→A and 376 A→G mutations were assigned by polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. Results: Of the 212 subjects enrolled, genotypes were available for 210, made up of 61 males and 149 females. G6PD-deficient males (hemizygotes) and females (homozygotes) constituted 3.27% (2/61) and 0.0% (0/149), respectively. Female heterozygotes (AA- and BA-) constituted 10.07% (15/149), while G6PD wild-type males (with A or B haplotype) and females (with AA, BB or AB haplotypes) consisted of 96.72% (59/61) and 89.93% (134/149), respectively. The A-, A and B allele frequencies were 0.0474, 0.3036 and 0.6490, respectively. Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium tests for female genotype frequencies did not show deviation (p=0.29). Conclusions: The frequency of G6PD deficiency alleles in males in the Kavango and Zambezi regions of northern Namibia constitute 3.27%, a first report to inform policy on primaquine role out. ? 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

These children are at a high risk of missed, fragmented and/or inappropriate care, and families bear extraordinary financial burden and stress. While small in number (<1% of children), this group uses ?1/3 of all child healthcare resources, and need coordinated care to optimise their health. Complex care for kids Ontario (CCKO) brings researchers, families and healthcare providers together to develop, implement and evaluate a population-level roll-out of care for CMC in Ontario, Canada through a randomised controlled trial (RCT) design. The intervention includes dedicated key workers and the utilisation of coordinated shared care plans. Methods and analysis: Our primary objective is to evaluate the CCKO intervention using a randomised waitlist control design. The waitlist approach involves rolling out an intervention over time, whereby all participants are randomised into two groups (A and B) to receive the intervention at different time points determined at random. Baseline measurements are collected at month 0, and groups A and B are compared at months 6 and 12. The primary outcome is the family-prioritized Family Experiences with Coordination of Care (FECC) survey at 12 months. The FECC will be compared between groups using an analysis of covariance with the corresponding baseline score as the covariate. Secondary outcomes include reports of child and parent health outcomes, health system utilisation and process outcomes. Ethics and dissemination: Research ethics approval has been obtained for this multicentre RCT. This trial will assess the effect of a large population-level complex care intervention to determine whether dedicated key workers and coordinated care plans have an impact on improving service delivery and quality of life for CMC and their families. ? 2019 Author(s).",children; complex care; health services; medical complexity; parents; randomized controlled trial,analysis of covariance; article; case report; child; clinical article; coordination; female; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care utilization; human; male; multicenter study; Ontario; outcome assessment; quality of life; randomized controlled trial; research ethics; scientist,2-s2.0-85070236800

No effective medical therapy currently exists for HGMs, and developing novel therapeutic strategies depends on the identification of molecular drivers. In cancer, β1 integrin enhances malignant characteristics, including proliferation, invasion, and drug resistance. Objective: We conducted this study to investigate whether β1 integrin could be a therapeutic target in HGMs. Patients and Methods: Expression of β1 integrin was examined in gene array datasets, with proteomics of clinical meningioma specimens, and in patient-derived HGM xenografts. Anti-tumor activity of OS2966, a first-in-class humanized antagonizing monoclonal antibody against β1 integrin, was tested in vitro and in vivo using an orthotopic mouse model of patient-derived malignant meningioma. Results: β1 integrin was expressed in meningiomas of all WHO grades and two xenografts tested. In vitro, OS2966 suppressed the viability of NF2-deficient MN3 sphere cells and NF2-wild-type IOMM-Lee malignant meningioma cells only when plated on laminin-coated plastic. While OS2966 decreased phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in both MN3 cells and laminin-grown IOMM-Lee cells, OS2966 only affected the phosphorylation of FAK (Tyr397) in MN3, and of Akt (Ser473) in IOMM-Lee cells, respectively, indicating differential pathway inhibition. Systemic administration of OS2966 in mice bearing orthotopic MN3 HGMs inhibited HGM cell proliferation and significantly extended overall survival of the treated mice. Conclusions: β1 Integrin may be a therapeutic target in HGMs, and further preclinical and clinical development of OS2966 for HGM therapy is warranted. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,antineoplastic agent; beta1 integrin; epithelial membrane antigen; focal adhesion kinase; Ki 67 antigen; laminin; lymphocyte antibody; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; os 2966; transcriptome; unclassified drug; vimentin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antineoplastic activity; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer grading; cancer survival; cell proliferation; cell viability; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug efficacy; drug targeting; enzyme phosphorylation; female; human; human cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; intracellular signaling; malignant meningioma; mouse; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; overall survival; priority journal; protein expression; protein protein interaction; RNA analysis,2-s2.0-85068827513

There is evidence that what a mother eats during pregnancy interacts with her genes to affect her child's susceptibility to poor health outcomes including childhood obesity, pre-diabetes, allergy and asthma. Furthermore, after what an infant eats can change his or her intestinal bacteria, which can further influence the development of these poor outcomes. In the present paper, we review the importance of birth cohorts, the formation and early findings from a multi-ethnic birth cohort alliance in Canada and summarise our future research directions for this birth cohort alliance. We summarise a method for harmonising collection and analysis of self-reported dietary data across multiple cohorts and provide examples of how this birth cohort alliance has contributed to our understanding of gestational diabetes risk; ethnic and diet-influences differences in the healthy infant microbiome; and the interplay between diet, ethnicity and birth weight. Ongoing work in this birth cohort alliance will focus on the use of metabolomic profiling to measure dietary intake, discovery of unique diet-gene and diet-epigenome interactions, and qualitative interviews with families of children at risk of metabolic syndrome. Our findings to-date and future areas of research will advance the evidence base that informs dietary guidelines in pregnancy, infancy and childhood, and will be relevant to diverse and high-risk populations of Canada and other high-income countries. ? 2019 The Authors.",Birth cohort; Birth weight; Diet; Microbiome; Nutrition; Pregnancy,adult; birth weight; Canadian; cardiometabolic risk; cohort analysis; Conference Paper; dietary intake; epigenetics; ethnicity; family health; female; genotype environment interaction; high income country; high risk population; human; infant; infant nutrition; male; maternal nutrition; metabolomics; nutritional status; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; risk factor; self report,2-s2.0-85066453703

Among patients with recent ESUS, we sought to determine independent predictors of recurrent ischemic stroke during treatment with aspirin or rivaroxaban and to assess the relative effects of these treatments according to risk. Methods: Exploratory analyses of 7213 participants in the NAVIGATE ESUS international trial who were randomized to aspirin 100 mg/day or rivaroxaban 15 mg/day and followed for a median of 11 months, during which time there were 309 first recurrent ischemic strokes (4.6% per year). Baseline features were correlated with recurrent stroke by multivariate analysis. Results: The 7 independent predictors of recurrent stroke were stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) prior to the qualifying stroke (hazard ratio [HR] 2.03 95% confidence internal [CI] 1.58-2.60), current tobacco user (HR 1.62, 95% CI 1.24-2.12), age (HR 1.02 per year increase, 95%CI 1.01-1.03), diabetes (HR 1.28, 95% CI 1.01-1.64), multiple acute infarcts on neuroimaging (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.09-2.02), aspirin use prior to qualifying stroke (HR 1.34, 95% CI 1.02-1.70), and time from qualifying stroke to randomization (HR .98, 95% CI .97-.99). The rate of recurrent stroke rate was 2.6% per year for participants without any of these risk factors, and increased by an average of 45% for each independent predictor (P < .001). There were no significant interactions between treatment effects and independent stroke predictors or stroke risk status. Conclusions: In this large cohort of ESUS patients, several features including prior stroke or TIA, advanced age, current tobacco user, multiple acute infarcts on neuroimaging, and diabetes independently identified those with an increased risk of ischemic stroke recurrence. The relative effects of rivaroxaban and aspirin were similar across the spectrum of independent stroke predictors and recurrent stroke risk status. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Embolic stroke; ESUS; prediction of recurrent stroke; recurrent stroke; rivaroxaban; stroke recurrence,acetylsalicylic acid; rivaroxaban; acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; rivaroxaban; aged; algorithm; aortic valve disease; artery occlusion; Article; autopsy; body mass; brain infarction; brain ischemia; Canada; cerebrovascular accident; clinical assessment; clinical feature; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diastolic blood pressure; disease severity; double blind procedure; drug effect; East Asian; Eastern Europe; embolic strokes of undetermined source; embolic strokes of undetermined source; Europe; exploratory factor analysis; female; follow up; human; hypertension; life history trait; major clinical study; male; mitral valve disease; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; neuroimaging; North America; patent foramen ovale; phase 3 clinical trial; prediction; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; recurrent disease; risk factor; South and Central America; stroke patient; systolic blood pressure; tobacco; transesophageal echocardiography; transient ischemic attack; United States; Western Europe; brain embolism; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; comparative study; middle aged; multicenter study; recurrent disease; risk assessment; time factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Anticoagulants; Aspirin; Brain Ischemia; Double-Blind Method; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Female; Humans; Intracranial Embolism; Male; Middle Aged; Recurrence; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Rivaroxaban; Stroke; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-85066339482

Methods: Respondents from the US adult population were quota-sampled on the basis of age, sex, ethnicity, and race. Trained interviewers guided participants in completing composite time trade-off (cTTO) and discrete choice experiment (DCE) tasks using the EuroQol Valuation Technology software and routine quality control measures. Data were modeled using a Tobit model for cTTO data, a mixed logit model for DCE data, and a hybrid model that combined cTTO and DCE data. Model performance was compared on the basis of logical ordering of coefficients, statistical significance, parsimony, and theoretical considerations. Results: Of 1134 respondents, 1062, 1099, and 1102 respondents provided useable cTTO, DCE, and cTTO or DCE responses, respectively, on the basis of quality control criteria and interviewer judgment.

Values ranged from ?0.573 (55 555) to 1 (11 111), with 20% of all predicted health states scores less than 0 (ie, worse than dead). Conclusions: A societal value set for the EQ-5D-5L was developed that can be used for economic evaluations and decision making in US health systems. The internationally established, standardized protocol used to develop this US-based value set was recommended by the EuroQol Group and can facilitate cross-country comparisons. ? 2019 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",cost-utility analysis; EQ-5D; quality-adjusted life-year; stated preference; United States; utility; value,adult; article; controlled study; cost utility analysis; decision making; ethnicity; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions 5 Level questionnaire; female; health status; human; human experiment; human tissue; major clinical study; male; quality adjusted life year; quality control; race; software; statistical significance; theoretical study; time trade-off method; United States,2-s2.0-85066073136

While survivors of extremely low birth weight (ELBW; < 1,000 grams) are more likely to manifest poor motor coordination than people born at normal birth weight (NBW; > 2,500 g), they have had better mental health outcomes than those with NBW who have motor difficulties. How emotion is experienced is an important risk factor for mental illness; yet, little is known about the affective experience of survivors of ELBW who also have poor motor coordination. In this longitudinal study, we examined interactions between birth weight status and childhood motor coordination on affective experience among 88 ELBW and 89 NBW participants. We first assessed childhood motor coordination at eight years of age, using the Bruininks-Oseretsky Test of Motor Proficiency, and we later gathered self-report data regarding affective style, using the Positive and Negative Affect Scedule and the Affective Styles Questionnaire, when these participants were 30-35 years of age. We found a statistically significant interaction between motor coordination and birth weight status. As motor coordination worsened among ELBW survivors, positive affect increased, while we observed the opposite trend in NBW participants (p < 0.05). There was no interaction for negative affect. Positive affect may contribute to previous findings of better relative adult mental health among ELBW survivors with poor childhood motor coordination. Strategies aimed at optimizing positive affect may be fruitful for optimizing mental health outcomes among preterm survivors and others with reduced motor proficiency. ?

HRQL measures are specific, for example for a disease, or generic with broad applicability. The latter include preference-based measures that can be used to generate quality-adjusted life years and so contribute to economic evaluation. Measures of HRQL in adolescents and young adults (AYAs) with cancer may fail to capture some important dimensions, for example sexual health. However, the use of HRQL measures in this population has identified burdens of morbidity according to disease, treatment status and duration of follow-up. There are few economic evaluations of the treatment of cancer in AYAs but preliminary evidence suggests that this is a cost-effective undertaking.

Methods: We performed a systematic search of publication databases to identify studies of medical management of pediatric Crohn's disease. Quality of evidence and strength of recommendations were rated according to the GRADE (Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach. We developed statements through an iterative online platform and then finalized and voted on them. Results: The consensus includes 25 statements focused on medical treatment options. Consensus was not reached, and no recommendations were made, for 14 additional statements, largely due to lack of evidence. The group suggested corticosteroid therapies (including budesonide for mild to moderate disease). The group suggested exclusive enteral nutrition for induction therapy and biologic tumor necrosis factor antagonists for induction and maintenance therapy at diagnosis or at early stages of severe disease, and for patients failed by steroid and immunosuppressant induction therapies. The group recommended against the use of oral 5-aminosalicylate for induction or maintenance therapy in patients with moderate disease, and recommended against thiopurines for induction therapy, corticosteroids for maintenance therapy, and cannabis in any role. The group was unable to clearly define the role of concomitant immunosuppressants during initiation therapy with a biologic agent, although thiopurine combinations are not recommended for male patients. No consensus was reached on the role of aminosalicylates in treatment of patients with mild disease, antibiotics or vedolizumab for induction or maintenance therapy, or methotrexate for induction therapy. Patients in clinical remission who are receiving immunomodulators should be assessed for mucosal healing within 1 year of treatment initiation.

Our objective was to comprehensively examine objective and validated, disease-specific subjective sinonasal and pulmonary outcomes of aspirin (ASA) desensitization therapy in this patient population. Methods: Prospective cohort study at an academic tertiary center. AERD patients with a history of chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis (CRSwNP), prior diagnosis of asthma, and a history of ASA sensitivity were eligible for inclusion. Patients underwent ASA desensitization using an established institutional protocol and continued on a 650 mg twice daily maintenance dose. Baseline Sinonasal Outcome Test (SNOT-22) and Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ) responses, acoustic rhinometry, peak flow readings, and endoscopic scoring of nasal polyps were recorded prior to desensitization and after 6 months of maintenance therapy. Results: Twelve patients were recruited for participation and underwent desensitization. Eight patients continued maintenance therapy and follow up at 6 months. Prior to desensitization, patients reported bothersome sinonasal symptoms with a median SNOT-22 score of 30.0 ± 34.5 (interquartile range (IQR)). There was significant improvement after 6 months of maintenance therapy to a median SNOT-22 score of 18.5 ± 17.3 (p = 0.025, Wilcoxon signed rank test). Acoustic rhinometry, endoscopic scores, ACQ and forced expiratory volume values remained stable at 6 months. Conclusions: AERD patients may benefit from ASA desensitization with subjective sinonasal symptom improvement at 6 months and stable asthma and objective sinonasal measures.

We developed a guideline implementation tool, consisting of a 10-week, case-based education intervention delivered by email, that was perceived to increase rehabilitation professionals' (occupational therapists (OTs), physical therapists (PTs), and speech language pathologists (SLPs)) knowledge and confidence to apply best practices in HIV rehabilitation. This study aimed to increase understanding of how the design of the guideline implementation tool facilitated increased awareness of and access to the e-module among rehabilitation professionals. Methods: We conducted a single group intervention study with rehabilitation professionals in Canada and the United Kingdom. Six case studies targeting HIV pathophysiology and associated conditions, an interprofessional approach to rehabilitation assessment and treatment, and psychosocial issues experienced by people living with HIV, were emailed to participants at 2-week intervals. Individual semi-structured interviews were conducted post-intervention. Interview transcripts were analysed using a descriptive qualitative approach. Results: Twenty-six individuals (17 from Canada, and 9 from the UK; 16 PTs, 7 OTs, 3 SLPs) were interviewed. One main theme related to design features of the intervention that facilitated learning and access to the e-module emerged. Subthemes highlighted features of the case-based intervention, including technical feasibility, terminology, formatting and layout, hyperlinks, number and frequency of case studies, and diverse and realistic case scenarios relevant to the learner's practice, that participants described as facilitating access to information and learning. Conclusion: Electronically administered case studies were perceived as complementary knowledge tools that increased access to an evidence-informed guide to HIV rehabilitation.

Enrolled VTE-PRO participants self-inject either low-molecular weight heparin or a saline placebo for 30 days postoperatively. Study outcomes include feasibility, incidence of venous thromboembolism, and venous thromboembolism-related morbidity and mortality. Initial analyses demonstrated low rates of accrual and retention for the VTE-PRO pilot. Therefore, the purpose of the current study was to develop a knowledge translation intervention to improve VTE-PRO pilot trial accrual and retention. Methods: Eligible participants were surveyed to identify the barriers to VTE-PRO participation. The Theoretical Domains Framework was used to categorize these barriers. Barriers were mapped to the capabilities, opportunities, and behavior (COM-B) behavioral change wheel to identify potential interventions to support trial accrual and retention. The resulting knowledge translation intervention was titled Inform, Remind, Involve and Support to improve Accrual and Retention (IRIS-AR). Key informant interviews with patients were held to refine and confirm the validity of identified barriers and perceived acceptability of the proposed IRIS-AR intervention. Institutional Review Board approval was granted for this study. Results: The resulting intervention included: information booklets and counseling sessions to identify unique participant challenges to trial participation (Inform); daily reminders to administer injections (Remind); involvement of family/caregivers in study processes (Involve); and leverage of an existing home-care nursing program to provide injection support when needed (Support). Twenty-six key informant participants were interviewed. The most common barriers to trial participation included lack of social support and fear of needle injection. Participants generally supported use of information booklets, involvement of family/caregivers, and support by a home-care nursing program; however, not all supported the use of daily reminders. Conclusion: Developed using theory and integrated knowledge translation, the IRIS-AR presents a patient-centered intervention that leverages existing programs to promote trial engagement. The proposed strategy can likely be adapted to improve compliance with other patient-directed interventions. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Accrual; Behavior change wheel; Randomized trials; Retention; Theoretical domains framework,"Article; behavior change; Canada; caregiver; controlled study; health program; home care; human; intervention study; learning; needle phobia; parent counseling; patient care; pilot study; program acceptability; prophylaxis; prospective study; randomized controlled trial (topic); social support; venous thromboembolism; adverse event; attitude to health; decision making; drug administration; drug self administration; injection; lung resection; lung tumor; patient education; patient selection; psychology; randomized controlled trial; research subject; sample size; time factor; treatment outcome; venous thromboembolism; anticoagulant agent; low molecular weight heparin; Anticoagulants; Choice Behavior; Drug Administration Schedule; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight; Humans; Injections; Lung Neoplasms; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Selection; Pilot Projects; Pneumonectomy; Research Subjects; Sample Size; Self Administration; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Venous Thromboembolism",2-s2.0-85069439527

Such interventions, however, require measurement tools that support intervention planning, monitoring and evaluation. The primary purpose of this study is to describe the process in developing a framework for a Canadian post-secondary health surveillance tool known as the Canadian Campus Wellbeing Survey (CCWS). Methods: Nineteen health service providers or mental health experts from 5 Canadian provinces participated in a 3-round Delphi survey by email and an in-person roundtable meeting to identify wellbeing and health behavior measurement priorities and indicators for the CCWS. Results: The final CCWS framework consisted of 9 core sections: mental health assets, student experience, mental health deficits, health service utilization/help seeking, physical health/health behaviors, academic achievement, substance use, nutrition, and sexual health behavior. Panelists generally agreed on a set of indicators, and reached consensus for at least one indicator per core section. Conclusion: This CCWS framework is the first step in developing a common surveillance mechanism tailored to the Canadian postsecondary context. Future work will include online consultation with health service providers from a broader range of post-secondary institutions, an in-person meeting with research and measurement experts to finalize survey items, and formative testing. The CCWS will play a valuable role in developing population health initiatives targeting the increasing number of young Canadians attending postsecondary institutions. ? 2019 The Author(s).",College; Health behavior; Mental health; Students; Surveys; University,academic achievement; adult; article; Canadian; college; consultation; Delphi study; e-mail; female; health behavior; health care utilization; human; human experiment; male; mental health; nutrition; population health; sexual health; student; substance use; wellbeing; Canada; Delphi study; health survey; psychology; questionnaire; student; university; young adult; Canada; Delphi Technique; Health Behavior; Humans; Mental Health; Population Surveillance; Students; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85069440942

A network of therapeutic relationships during transitional period assists in discharge planning and recovery. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the implementation of the transitional discharge model (TDM), an intervention for community integration of clients with mental health illness. This study used a participatory action research design to evaluate TDM implementation in nine hospitals across Ontario, Canada. The study enrolled 370 participants from participating hospitals. The analyses compared data on readmissions, length of stay, and hospitals spending that were collected at three points in time: prior and after four and eight months of TDM implementation. Corresponding results indicated no statistically significant differences in pre and post-intervention readmission means. The average length of stay, in eight months following the implementation, decreased by 9.8 days; however, results showed no statistically significant difference between pre and post-intervention median length of stay (mean rank = 6.63 vs. 5.64), Z = ?0.585, p = 0.592). Additionally, comparisons of implementation cost to hospital spending found a total savings of $3,392,810. In addition to cost-savings to the health care system as demonstrated by reduced length of stay, TDM implementation provides cost-effective supports to help keep clients in the community and out of the hospital. As such, TDM implementation provides mental health practice and policy one of the unique opportunities for effective discharge of clients from hospital to community mental health services, through early discharge planning and connecting clients to community peer support system. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Community integration; mental health; mental health policy; peer support; transitional discharge model (TDM),,2-s2.0-85071395637

While a myriad of studies have sought to individually examine well water quality or the stewardship behaviours among well owners and users, few have effectively explored the intersection between private groundwater contamination and human behaviour. Even hydrosociology, socio-hydrology, and socio-hydrogeology, which make cases for an integrated, transdisciplinary approach to water-related challenges, do not appropriately describe the full range or complexity of interactions between the hydrological, geological and human systems necessary for effective public health interventions. To respond to this gap, a novel framework is proposed within the Canadian context, building upon ecohealth principles, and applied to an exposure framework developed for private wells. This framework improves upon current hydrologically based approaches and provides a comprehensive coupled (social and physical) systems framing of risk within the context of private well ownership. Application of this conceptual framework may be employed to support both transformative public health responses and effective stewardship by well owners. ? 2019, ? 2019 Canadian Water Resources Association.",,Behavioral research; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Hydrogeology; Potable water; Public health; Water quality; Water wells; Conceptual frameworks; Coupled systems; Domestic water use; Groundwater contamination; Health interventions; Health response; Human behaviours; Trans-disciplinary approaches; Health risks,2-s2.0-85063583602

METHODS: This was a secondary data analysis of baseline data from the Build Better Bones with Exercise randomized controlled trial using the BOOMER. A total of 141 women with osteoporosis and radiographically confirmed vertebral fracture were included. Concurrent validity and internal consistency were assessed in comparison to the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). Normality and ceiling/floor effects of total BOOMER scores and component test items were also assessed. Exploratory analyses of assistive aid use and falls history were performed. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Tests for concurrent validity demonstrated moderate correlation between total BOOMER and SPPB scores. The BOOMER component tests showed modest internal consistency. Substantial ceiling effect and nonnormal score distributions were present among overall sample and those not using assistive aids for total BOOMER scores, although scores were normally distributed for those using assistive aids. The static standing with eyes closed test demonstrated the greatest ceiling effects of the component tests, with 92% of participants achieving a maximal score. CONCLUSIONS: While the BOOMER compares well with the SPPB in community-dwelling women with vertebral fractures, researchers or clinicians considering using the BOOMER in similar or higher-functioning populations should be aware of the potential for ceiling effects.",,,2-s2.0-85069990140

The diagnostic criteria for FH rely on a point system using low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), family history, cutaneous manifestations, and molecular diagnosis. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of FH in the Relating Evidence to Achieve Cholesterol Targets (REACT) registry. Methods: Patients were enrolled as ASCVD (n = 86) or FH (n = 109) and with an LDL-C level > 3.0 mmol/L despite maximally tolerated statin therapy. FH was diagnosed clinically using a validated clinical application integrating an imputation for baseline (untreated) LDL-C levels. Results: There were 109 men and 86 women with a mean age of 63 ± 12 years. Diabetes (29.7%), hypertension (62.1%), smoking (37.9%), and family history of premature ASCVD (59.5%) were common. On-treatment LDL-C was 4.26 ± 0.94 mmol/L. On the basis of the dose and type of statin ± ezetimibe, imputed baseline LDL-C was 7.04 ± 2.90 mmol/L. A diagnosis of probable/definite FH was found in 54.7%, 49.5%, and 61.5% of patients according to the Simon Broome, Dutch Lipid Clinic Network criteria, and the new Canadian FH definition, respectively. Of note, 40% of patients in the ASCVD inclusion subgroup had probable or definite FH. Conclusions: Our study reveals that a substantial proportion of patients with ASCVD whose LDL-C levels are > 3.0 mmol/L despite maximally tolerated statins have heterozygous FH. Clinicians should consider using the recently described algorithm to assess the possibility of FH in this high-risk population. ? 2019 Canadian Cardiovascular Society",,atorvastatin; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; rosuvastatin; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; cardiovascular risk; coronary artery atherosclerosis; diabetes mellitus; drug tolerability; familial hypercholesterolemia; family history; female; high risk population; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; prediction; risk factor; smoking; treatment outcome; validation study,2-s2.0-85069944644

Design Analysis of a subset of data from a qualitative study using semistructured interviews and focus groups. Setting University of Toronto in Ontario. Participants A total of 9 family medicine faculty members and 6 family medicine residents. Methods A subset of transcripts from a 2015 qualitative study that explored family medicine and psychiatry residents' and faculty members' understanding of the CanMEDS-Family Medicine health advocate role were reviewed, guided by interpretive descriptive methodology. Main findings Results indicated that family medicine physicians and residents were able to identify the full spectrum of advocacy described in the Canadian Family Physician articles and that they valued the role. Further, there was widespread agreement that being a health advocate was linked with their identities as health professionals. The time it takes to be a health advocate was seen as a barrier to being effective in the role, and the work was seen as extremely challenging owing to system constraints. Participants also described a gap in training relating to advocacy at the system level as a challenge. Conclusion Team-based care was seen as one of the most important enablers for becoming involved in the full spectrum of advocacy, as was time for personal reflection. ? 2019 College of Family Physicians of Canada.

The magnitude of IHI may be related to the size of the cortical representation for a given muscle as a mechanism for facilitating unimanual control. To date, the relationship between IHI and cortical muscle representations remains unknown. Fifteen healthy, right-handed individuals participated in the present study. IHI was examined in the right first dorsal interosseous (FDI) muscle by delivering conditioning TMS to ipsilateral (right) primary motor cortex (M1) followed by a test TMS pulse to contralateral (left) M1. The size of the FDI representation in M1 was determined by delivering suprathreshold TMS over a 5 × 5-cm grid centered on the FDI motor hotspot of the left M1. Both IHI and cortical territory were obtained during three conditions: rest, contralateral (right) FDI contraction, and ipsilateral (left) FDI contraction. Results indicate a significant association between IHI and the size of the FDI representation only in the context of contraction and not when the FDI muscle was relaxed. Specifically, reduced IHI corresponded to larger cortical FDI representations during both contralateral and ipsilateral contraction. These data demonstrate that, for a muscle of the hand, the magnitude of IHI and the cortical territory are associated within the context of muscle contraction. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This study provides evidence from noninvasive brain stimulation that communication between the motor cortexes of the two hemispheres plays a role in shaping the motor cortical map that outputs to a hand muscle during active contraction of that muscle. This relationship exists only when the hand muscle is contracted. The findings presented further our understanding of motor control during unilateral movement and may inform future research targeting clinical populations that exhibit impaired unilateral control. ? 2019 the American Physiological Society.",FDI; IHI; Motor map; Tms; Transcranial magnetic stimulation,adult; article; brain depth stimulation; clinical article; controlled study; female; hand muscle; human; human experiment; male; modulation; motor control; muscle contractility; muscle contraction; primary motor cortex; rest; transcranial magnetic stimulation,2-s2.0-85069800248

Laryngeal oedema is a known complication of intubation that may cause airway obstruction in a patient on extubation. To date, the only test available to predict this complication is the cuff leak test (CLT); however, its diagnostic accuracy and utility remains uncertain. Herein, we report the protocol for the CuffLeak and AirwayObstruction in MechanicallyVentilated ICU Patients (COMIC) pilottrial. Methods and analysis This will be a multicentred, pragmatic, pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT). We will enrol 100 mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU who are deemed ready for extubation. We will exclude patients at a high risk of laryngeal oedema. All enrolled patients will have a CLT done before extubation. In the intervention arm, the results of the CLT will be communicated to the bedside physician, and decision to extubate will be left to the treating team. In the control arm, respiratory therapist will not communicate the results of the CLT to the treating physician, and the patient will be extubated regardless of the CLT result. Randomisation will be done in a 1:1 allocation ratio, stratified by size of the endotracheal tube and duration of invasive mechanical ventilation. Although we will examine all clinical outcomes relevant for the future COMIC RCT, the primary outcomes of the COMIC pilottrial will be feasibility outcomes including: consent rate, recruitment rate and protocol adherence. Clinical outcomes include postextubation stridor, reintubation, emergency surgical airway, ICU mortality, in hospital mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of stay in days. Ethics and dissemination The Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board, Imam Abdulrahman Bin Faisal University Institutional Review Board and Bioethical Commission of the Jagiellonian University approved this study. The trial results will be disseminated via publication in peer-reviewed journals.

We aimed to assess the ability of 4-phenylbutyrate (4-PBA), a small chemical chaperone administered via drinking water, to reduce atherosclerotic lesion size in chow-fed apolipoprotein (Apo) e?/? mice and to identify mechanisms that contribute to its antiatherogenic effect. Chow-fed 17-wk-old female Apoe?/? mice treated with 4-PBA–supplemented drinking water for 5 wk exhibited smaller lesions as well as increased plasma levels of heat shock protein (HSP) 25, the mouse homolog of human HSP27, compared with controls. In addition, 4-PBA inhibited cell death and increased HSP27 expression as measured by real-time PCR and immunoblotting, as well as induced nuclear localization of its transcription factor, heat shock factor 1, in human monocyte/macrophage (THP-1) cells. Furthermore, HSP27 small interfering RNA diminished the protective effect of 4-PBA on THP-1 macrophage attachment and differentiation. In summary, drinking water containing 4-PBA attenuated early lesion growth in Apoe?/? mice fed a chow diet and increased expression of HSP25 and HSP27 in macrophages and HSP25 in the circulation of Apoe?/? mice. Given that increased expression of HSP27 is inversely correlated with CVD risk, our findings suggest that 4-PBA protects against the early stages of atherogenesis in part by enhancing HSP27 levels, leading to inhibition of both macrophage cell death and monocyte-macrophage differentiation.—Lynn, E.

Therefore, radioprotective measures, against both acute and chronic biological effects of radiation, require frequent intake of nontoxic natural products, which have practical oral administration. The goal of this study was to characterize the radioprotective, radiomitigative and radiation-induced bystander effect-inhibiting properties of endogenous metabolites: phenylacetate, ursodeoxycholate and tauroursodeoxycholate. Compounds were administered pre- and postirradiation as well as in donor and recipient bystander flasks to analyze whether these might adequately protect against radiation injury as well as facilitate recovery from the exposures. The clonogenic HCT116 p53 wild-type cancer cell line in this study shares characteristics of stem cells, such as high reproductive viability, which is an effective marker to demonstrate compound effectiveness. Clonogenic assays were therefore used to characterize radioprotective, radiomitigative and bystander inhibiting properties of treatment compounds whereby cellular responses to radiation were quantified with macroscopic colony counts to measure cell survival in flasks. The results were statistically significant for phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate when administered preirradiation, conferring radioprotection up to 2 Gy, whereas administration postirradiation and in bystander experiments did not confer radioprotection in vitro. These findings suggest that phenylacetate and tauroursodeoxycholate might be effective radioprotectors, although they possess no radiomitigative properties. ? 2019 by Radiation Research Society.",,"cesium 137; phenylacetic acid; protein p53; tauroursodeoxycholic acid; ursodeoxycholic acid; acetic acid; phenol derivative; phenyl acetate; radioprotective agent; taurochenodeoxycholic acid; tauroursodeoxycholic acid; ursodeoxycholic acid; Article; bystander effect; cancer stem cell; cell survival; cell viability; clonogenesis; clonogenic assay; colon carcinoma; controlled study; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; ionizing radiation; priority journal; radiation exposure; radiation injury; radiation protection; radiation response; signal transduction; bystander effect; colon tumor; drug effect; metabolism; pathology; signal transduction; Acetates; Bystander Effect; Cell Survival; Colonic Neoplasms; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Phenols; Radiation-Protective Agents; Signal Transduction; Taurochenodeoxycholic Acid; Ursodeoxycholic Acid",2-s2.0-85068380936

This randomized controlled study (n= 40) examined the effect of a three-session motivational interviewing (MI) intervention compared to a three-session relaxation intervention prior to 15 sessions of ERP on treatment dropout, homework compliance, and treatment outcome post-ERP and at follow up. Contrary to hypotheses, there were no group differences in ERP dropout rates or homework compliance. Both groups experienced significant reductions in OCD symptoms post-ERP. Consistent with our hypothesis, the MI group experienced a greater reduction in OCD symptoms (clinician-rated YBOCS) compared to the comparison group immediately post-ERP. However, this difference did not hold over 12-month follow up. There were also no group differences in associated symptoms (depression, anxiety, stress) across treatment. All participants achieved significant symptom reductions that were maintained over time. A correlational analysis of the whole sample revealed that action scores pre-ERP were significantly negatively correlated with post-ERP OCD symptom severity. These findings suggest that MI prior to ERP may confer a small but meaningful benefit for enhancing treatment outcome post ERP. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Motivation; Motivational interviewing; Obsessive compulsive disorder; OCD; Treatment,adult; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; clinical article; controlled study; correlation analysis; depression; disease severity; exposure and response prevention; female; follow up; human; male; motivational interviewing; obsessive compulsive disorder; prevention study; priority journal; scoring system; stress; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85066301006

A proposed model was tested using data collected from two potential user groups: 198 online and 83 in-person, using an identical survey. Although the system was built and ready to use at the time this study was conducted, in order to keep the experience of both groups identical, a video simulation (of the system)was used to familiarize both groups of users with the system.

METHODS: We analyzed transcripts from semistructured interviews with 20 experts in food safety, food safety education in youth, and high-school education in Ontario. Inductive thematic analysis was used to identify priority food safety education needs. RESULTS: We identified 4 priority action areas for food safety education targeting students: how to safely do the things they typically do with food; how to keep themselves and their kitchens clean and safe; how microorganisms grow and how they can result in foodborne disease; and how to keep food out of the “danger zone” 4°C to 60°C (40° F to 140° F). The results indicate that students need specific education around the use of microwaves, consumption of convenience meals, preparing and handling foods at school events, and safe transportation of food for lunches, school trips, and sporting events. CONCLUSIONS: High-school students need food safety education specific to their usual interactions with food, including the foods, tools, and settings students regularly encounter. Delivery of food safety education should emphasize sequences of safe food-handling behaviors for specific food interactions, such as reheating a meal in the microwave, rather than traditional food safety concepts, such as temperature abuse. ? 2019, American School Health Association",adolescent; food safety; public Health; secondary schools,,2-s2.0-85065836996

We then assessed the correlations between FOCUS-50 and FOCUS-34 scores on these children. Results: Findings show that a shortened (34-item) version of FOCUS can be treated as equivalent to the full 50-item version.

What is the effect of altered shear stress pattern, with or without concurrent neurohumoral and metabolic activation, on the acute endothelial function response assessed via brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation? What is the main finding and its importance? Despite generating distinctive shear stress patterns (i.e. increases in anterograde only, anterograde only with neurohumoral and metabolic activation, and both anterograde and retrograde), similar acute improvements were observed in the brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation response in all conditions, indicating that anterograde and/or turbulent shear stress might be the essential element to induce acute increases in endothelial function. Abstract: Endothelial function is influenced by both the direction and the magnitude of shear stress. Acute improvements in endothelial function have mostly been attributed to increased anterograde shear, whereas results from many interventional models in humans suggest that enhancing shear stress in an oscillatory manner (anterograde and retrograde) might be optimal. Here, we determined the acute brachial artery shear stress (SS) and flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) responses to three shear-altering interventions [passive heat stress (HEAT), mechanical forearm compression (CUFF) and handgrip exercise (HGEX)] and examined the relationship between changes in oscillatory shear index (OSI) and changes in FMD. During separate visits, 10 young healthy men (22?±?3?years old) underwent 10?min of HEAT, CUFF or HGEX in their left forearm. Anterograde and retrograde SS, Reynolds number, OSI and FMD were assessed at rest and during/after each intervention. Anterograde SS increased during all interventions in a stepwise manner (P?&lt;?0.05 between interventions), with the change in HGEX (?37.7?±?12.2?dyn?cm?2, P?&lt;?0.05)?&gt;?CUFF (?25.1?±?11.9?dyn?cm?2, P?&lt;?0.05)?&gt;?HEAT (?14.5?±?7.9?dyn?cm?2, P?&lt;?0.05). Retrograde SS increased during CUFF (??19.6?±?4.3?dyn?cm?2, P?&lt;?0.05). Anterograde blood flow was turbulent (i.e. Reynolds number???|2000|) during all interventions (P?&lt;?0.05). The relative FMD improved after all interventions (P?=?0.01), and there was no relationship between ?OSI and ?FMD. We elicited changes in SS profiles including increased anterograde SS (HEAT and HGEX) and both increased anterograde and retrograde SS (CUFF); regardless of the SS pattern, FMD improved to the same extent. These findings suggest that the presence of anterograde and/or turbulent SS might be the key to optimizing endothelial function in acute assessment protocols. ? 2019 The Authors.

We assessed the analytical performance of the Dimension EXL hs-cTnI assay (LOCI method) across different matrices and compared it to two different acridinium ester-based hs-cTnI assays (ADVIA Centaur and Abbott ARCHITECT). Methods: The analytical sensitivity and precision below the 99th-percentile was determined for the Dimension EXL hs-cTnI assay. Method comparisons were performed between the Dimension EXL contemporary cTnI and the hs-cTnI assays, between different matrices for the EXL hs-cTnI assay (serum, lithium heparin and EDTA plasma), and between different hs-cTnI assays (EXL versus ADVIA Centaur or Abbott ARCHITECT) using non-parametric analyses. Results: The limit of blank and detection were 0.9 ng/L and 1.7 ng/L, respectively, with imprecision of 5.8% at 8.6 ng/L and 3.2% at 47.5 ng/L. Comparison between the EXL contemporary cTnI and hs-cTnI assay (range: 2.6–4214 ng/L) yielded proportional lower concentrations for the hs-cTnI assay (slope = 0.86; 95%CI: 0.81 to 0.96, n = 40); however, there was no difference in concentrations below 100 ng/L between the assays (median difference = ?2.7 ng/L; 95%CI: ?9.8 to 9.3). Passing-Bablok regression analysis with EDTA plasma yielded proportionally higher concentrations with the EXL hs-cTnI versus Abbott hs-cTnI (slope = 1.45; 95%CI: 1.02–1.86, n = 40) with proportionally lower concentrations with EDTA versus lithium heparin plasma with the EXL hs-cTnI assay alone (slope = 0.93; 95%CI: 0.90 to 0.99, n = 40). Comparison with Abbott hs-cTnI concentrations below 100 ng/L in the three matrices, indicated that the EXL hs-cTnI assay yielded higher concentrations (median difference range: 3.4–9.4 ng/L), with differences also evident when comparing the EXL hs-cTnI assay to the ADVIA Centaur hs-cTnI assay. Conclusion: The Siemens EXL hs-cTnI assay meets the analytical criteria for a high-sensitivity assay, with assay specific cutoffs important to maximize clinical performance. ? 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists",Analytical; High-sensitivity cardiac troponin I; Matrix; Method comparison,"edetic acid; heparin; lithium; troponin I; troponin I; Article; concentration (parameter); freeze thawing; human; intermethod comparison; limit of blank; limit of detection; measurement precision; priority journal; blood; diagnostic test; female; male; middle aged; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Female; Humans; Limit of Detection; Male; Middle Aged; Troponin I",2-s2.0-85065157494

Here, we describe the pharmacokinetic (PK) observations, along with modeling to further explore the interaction between ibrutinib and rituximab. Methods: 578 subjects were randomized to ibrutinib or placebo with BR (6?cycles). Ibrutinib PK samples and tumor measurements were obtained from all subjects; a subset was evaluated for bendamustine and rituximab PK. Population rituximab PK was assessed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Results: Dose-normalized plasma concentration-time bendamustine data were comparable between the arms. Systemic rituximab exposure was higher with BR-I versus BR; mean trough serum concentrations were 2- to 3-fold higher in the first three cycles and 1.2- to 1.7-fold higher subsequently. No relevant safety differences were observed. In the modeling, including treatment arm as a categorical covariate and tumor burden as a continuous time-varying covariate on overall rituximab clearance significantly improved fitting of the data. Conclusions: BR-I led to higher dose-normalized systemic rituximab exposure versus BR and more rapid steady-state achievement. The modeling data suggest that rituximab disposition is, at least in part, target mediated. Determining the clinical significance of these findings requires further assessments.

Method: We conducted a scoping review using Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, and the Cochrane libraries between October 2018 and January 2019. Results: Twenty-eight articles met review criteria. We found that different antipsychotic medications present different safety profiles. The risk of mortality was highest with conventional antipsychotic use and within 40?days of antipsychotic initiation. Conclusions: Conventional antipsychotic use increases mortality for older institutionalized adults. The evidence for atypical antipsychotics is less clear. Mortality risk appears highest within 30 to 40?days of initiating antipsychotic treatment.

Challenges with home postoperative care frequently lead to Emergency Department (ED) visits. A 2013 Ontario Pediatric Health Council recommended the integration of patient education into tonsillectomy care.

Methods: Systematic review of the Ovid Medline, Cochrane, CINAHL and EMBASE Classic databases were conducted using PRISMA guidelines. Results: Our search identified 335 articles. Final inclusion consisted of 10 studies. These studies included eight pre-operative booklets, one smartphone app, three text-message programs, one video program, one internet resource, and three caregiver programs. Most resources improved post-tonsillectomy ED visits, patient anxiety and pain management, while others had no effect on these factors.

In the general population, mammographic density can be modified by various exposures; whether this is true for women a strong family history is not known. Thus, we evaluated the association between reproductive, hormonal, and lifestyle risk factors and mammographic density among women with a strong family history of breast cancer but no BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Methods: We included 97 premenopausal and 59 postmenopausal women (age range: 27-68 years). Risk factor data was extracted from the research questionnaire closest in time to the mammogram performed nearest to enrollment. The Cumulus software was used to measure percent density, dense area, and non-dense area for each mammogram. Multivariate generalized linear models were used to evaluate the relationships between breast cancer risk factors and measures of mammographic density, adjusting for relevant covariates. Results: Among premenopausal women, those who had two live births had a mean percent density of 28.8% vs. 41.6% among women who had one live birth (P=0.04). Women with a high body weight had a lower mean percent density compared to women with a low body weight among premenopausal (17.6% vs. 33.2%; P=0.0006) and postmenopausal women (8.7% vs. 14.7%; P=0.04). Among premenopausal women, those who smoked for 14 years or longer had a lower mean dense area compared to women who smoked for a shorter duration (25.3cm2 vs. 53.1cm2; P=0.002). Among postmenopausal women, former smokers had a higher mean percent density (19.5% vs. 10.8%; P=0.003) and dense area (26.9% vs. 16.4%; P=0.01) compared to never smokers. After applying the Bonferroni correction, the association between body weight and percent density among premenopausal women remained statistically significant. Conclusions: In this cohort of women with a strong family history of breast cancer, body weight was associated with mammographic density. These findings suggest that mammographic density may explain the underlying relationship between some of these risk factors and breast cancer risk, and lend support for the inclusion of mammographic density into risk prediction models. ? 2019 The Author(s).",breast cancer; familial breast cancer; mammographic density; risk factors,"adult; aged; Article; body weight; breast cancer; breast density; cancer risk; cohort analysis; family history; female; human; lifestyle; live birth; major clinical study; mammography; postmenopause; premenopause; smoking; body weight; breast density; breast tumor; cross-sectional study; diagnostic imaging; family health; genetics; mammography; middle aged; parity; reproductive health; risk factor; statistical model; tumor suppressor gene; Adult; Aged; Body Weight; Breast Density; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ex-Smokers; Family Health; Female; Genes, BRCA1; Genes, BRCA2; Humans; Life Style; Linear Models; Mammography; Middle Aged; Parity; Postmenopause; Premenopause; Reproductive Health; Risk Factors; Smokers",2-s2.0-85068891251

The purpose of this paper is to provide a description of a tailored knowledge translation intervention implemented by knowledge brokers (KBs), and reflections on the factors that facilitated or hindered its implementation. Methods: The 22-month knowledge translation intervention, implemented by two KBs, sought to facilitate evidence-informed public health decision-making. Data on outcomes were collected using a knowledge, skills and behavioural assessment survey. In addition, the KBs maintained reflective journals noting which activities appeared successful or not, as well as factors related to the individual or the organisation that facilitated or hindered evidence-informed decision-making. Results: Tailoring of the knowledge translation intervention to address the needs, preferences and structure of each organisation resulted in three unique interventions being implemented. A consistent finding across organisations was that each site needed to determine where evidence-informed decision-making 'fit' within pre-existing organisational processes. Components of the intervention consistent across the three organisations included one-to-one mentoring of teams through rapid evidence reviews, large group workshops and regular meetings with senior management. Components that varied included the frequency of the KB being physically onsite, the amount of time staff spent with the KB and proportion of time spent one-to-one with a KB versus in workshops. Key facilitating factors for implementation included strong leadership, influential power of champions, supportive infrastructure, committed resources and staff enthusiasm. Conclusions: The results of this study illustrate the importance of working collaboratively with organisations to tailor knowledge translation interventions to best meet unique needs, preferences, organisational structures and contexts. Organisational factors such as leadership, champions and supportive infrastructure play a key role in determining the impact of the knowledge translation interventions. Future studies should explore how these factors can be fostered and/or developed within organisations. While KBs implemented the knowledge translation intervention in this study, more research is needed to understand the impact of all change agent roles including KBs, as well as how these roles can be maintained in the long-term if proven effective. ? 2019 The Author(s).",capacity-building; Evidence-informed decision-making; knowledge broker; knowledge translation; public health,article; Canada; capacity building; human; leadership; mentoring; organization; organizational structure; outcome assessment; skill; Canada; capacity building; consultation; decision making; evidence based practice; health care personnel; knowledge; public health; questionnaire; translational research; Canada; Capacity Building; Consultants; Decision Making; Evidence-Based Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Knowledge; Leadership; Organizations; Public Health; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translational Medical Research,2-s2.0-85067557515

We aimed to assess the feasibility of a larger study to ascertain the utility of cardiac troponin as a prognostic tool for mortality in critically ill patients. Methods: Patients admitted to participating intensive care units during the one-month enrolment period were eligible. We excluded cardiac surgical patients and patients who were admitted and either died or were discharged within 12 hr. In enrolled patients, we measured high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) and obtained electrocardiograms to ascertain the incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) and isolated troponin elevation. Our feasibility objectives were to measure recruitment rate, the proportion of patients who consented under a deferred consent model, and time required for data collection and study procedures. Results: Over a four-week enrolment period, 280 patients were enrolled using a deferred consent model. We obtained subsequent consent from 81% of patients. Study procedures and data collection required 1.7 hr per participant. Overall, 86 (38%) suffered a MI, 23 (10%) had an isolated hs-cTnI elevation, and 117 (52%) had no hs-cTnI elevation. The crude hospital mortality rate was 10% without an hs-cTnI elevation, 29% with an isolated hs-cTnl elevation (relative risk [RR]) 2.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.0 to 6.0) and 29% with an MI (RR, 2.6; 95% CI, 1.4 to 5.1).

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare the safety and efficacy of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in patients with AF undergoing cardioversion. Methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and EMBASE for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing DOACs to VKAs in patients undergoing cardioversion for AF. We performed title, abstract, and full-text screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation independently and in duplicate. We pooled data using a random effects model and evaluated the overall quality of evidence using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation. Results: We identified three eligible RCTs (n = 5203) and 21 observational studies (n = 11,855). The three RCTs and four observational studies were at low risk of bias. In RCTs (mean follow-up, 30?days), thromboembolic events occurred in 0.18% of patients receiving DOACs, as compared with 0.55% receiving VKAs (relative risk [RR] 0.40, 95% CI [0.13, 1.24], moderate quality). Major bleeding occurred in 0.42% of patients receiving DOACs as compared with 0.64% receiving VKAs (RR 0.62, 95% CI [0.28, 1.35], moderate quality), and death occurred in 0.28% of patients receiving DOACs as compared with 0.38% receiving VKAs (RR 0.70, 95% CI [0.23, 2.10], low quality). Confidence in the estimates of effect for observational studies was very low. Conclusion: DOACs peri-cardioversion in patients with AF appears safe from both a bleeding and thromboembolic risk perspective. Available evidence supports the use of DOACs as standard of care peri-cardioversion in patients with AF. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Anticoagulation; Cardiology; Cardioversion; Stroke; Thrombosis,anticoagulant agent; antivitamin K; Article; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; cardiovascular mortality; cardioversion; comparative study; drug efficacy; drug safety; human; meta analysis; patient monitoring; patient selection; priority journal; systematic review; thromboembolism; transesophageal echocardiography,2-s2.0-85064833393

This study sought to quantify the effect of cumulative procedure volume on inpatient cost and characterize the excess cost associated with a surgeon’s learning curve. Methods: This was a retrospective study of 29 high-volume surgeons during the first 6?years of performing gastric bypass in a regionalized center of excellence system. Cumulative volume was determined using the procedure date and analyzed in blocks of 25 cases. The main outcomes of interest were inpatient cost for the initial hospital stay in 2014 Canadian dollars as well as prolonged length of stay (? 3?days). Results: Overall, 11,684 cases were identified from April 2009 to March 2015. After a surgeon’s 50th case, the adjusted inpatient cost decreased by $2775 (95% CI $? 4352 to $? 1204 p = 0.001) compared to the first 25 cases. Cost savings were maintained through a surgeon’s 400th case. The average cost savings after the 50th case was $2082 (95% CI $? 3194 to $? 962 p < 0.001) and the excess cost attributable to the first 50 cases was $104,077 (95%?CI?48,104 to 159,682) per surgeon. Surgeon experience was also associated with a decrease odds of prolonged length of stay. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the influence of surgeon experience on improved cost efficiencies. We also characterized that the average excess cost per surgeon of implementing gastric bypass was approximately $104,000. This is relevant to future health system planning as well as providing an economic incentive for impactful training interventions. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bariatric surgery; Costs; Learning curve,adult; article; bariatric surgery; controlled study; cost control; female; high volume surgeon; hospital patient; hospitalization; human; learning curve; length of stay; major clinical study; male; quantitative analysis; retrospective study; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; surgery,2-s2.0-85053763299

Women in India, one of the most gender unequal countries worldwide, face systemic gender disadvantage that significantly increases the risk of common mental disorders. This study's objective was to examine the factors influencing women's participation in psychosocial support groups, within an approach where community members work together to collectively strengthen their community's mental health. Methods: This community-based qualitative study was conducted from May to July 2016, across three peri-urban sites in Dehradun district, Uttarakhand, Northern India. Set within an NGO-run mental health project, data were collected through focus group discussions with individuals involved in psychosocial support groups including women with psychosocial disabilities as well as caregivers (N = 10, representing 59 women), and key informant interviews (N = 8) with community members and mental health professionals. Data were analyzed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: The principal barrier to participating in psychosocial support groups was restrictions on women's freedom of movement. Women in the community are not normally permitted to leave home, unless going to market or work, making it difficult for women to leave their home to participate in the groups. The restrictions emanated from the overall community's attitude toward gender relations, the women's own internalized gender expectations, and most significantly, the decision-making power of husbands and mothers-in-law. Other factors including employment and education shaped women's ability to participate in psychosocial support groups; however, the role of these additional factors must be understood in connection to a gender order limiting women's freedom of movement. Conclusions: Mental health access and gender inequality are inseparable in the context of Northern India, and women's mental health cannot be addressed without first addressing underlying gender relations. Community-based mental health programs are an effective tool and can be used to strengthen communities collectively; however, attention towards the gender constraints that restrict women's freedom of movement and their ability to access care is required. To our knowledge, this is the first study to clearly document and analyze the connection between access to community mental health services in South Asia and women's freedom of movement. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Community Mental health; Depression; Gender relations; Global Mental health; India; Psychosocial factors; Qualitative Research; Women's autonomy; Women's health,adult; Asia; attitude; decision making; depression; employment; family; female; freedom; gender identity; human; human relation; India; information processing; mental disease; mental health; mental health service; patient participation; psychology; qualitative research; self help; social participation; spouse; statistics and numerical data; women's health; Adult; Asia; Attitude; Community Mental Health Services; Decision Making; Depression; Employment; Family; Female; Focus Groups; Freedom; Gender Identity; Humans; India; Interpersonal Relations; Mental Disorders; Mental Health; Patient Participation; Qualitative Research; Self-Help Groups; Social Participation; Spouses; Women's Health,2-s2.0-85067115291

Developing effective interventions could improve detection, prevention, and treatment of diabetes. The Cardiovascular Health Awareness Program (CHAP), an evidence-based Canadian intervention, may be an appropriate model for LMICs due to its low cost, ease of implementation, and focus on health promotion and disease prevention. The primary aim of this study is to adapt the CHAP model to a Philippine context as the Community Health Assessment Program in the Philippines (CHAP-P) and evaluate the effect of CHAP-P on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) compared to a random sample of community residents in control communities. Methods: Six-month, 26-community (13 intervention, 13 control) parallel cluster randomized controlled trial in Zamboanga Peninsula, an Administrative Region in the southern Philippines. Criteria for community selection include: adequate political stability, connection with local champions, travel feasibility, and refrigerated space for materials. The community-based intervention, CHAP-P sessions, are volunteer-led group sessions with chronic condition assessment, blood pressure monitoring, and health education. Three participant groups will be involved: 1) Random sample of community participants aged 40 or older, 100 per community (1300 control, 1300 intervention participants total); 2) Community members aged 40 years or older who attended at least one CHAP-P session; 3) Community health workers and staff facilitating sessions. Primary outcome: mean difference in HbA1c at 6 months in intervention group individuals compared to control. Secondary outcomes: modifiable risk factors, health utilization and access (individual); diabetes detection and management (cluster). Evaluation also includes community process evaluation and cost-effectiveness analysis. Discussion: CHAP has been shown to be effective in a Canadian setting. Individual components of CHAP-P have been piloted locally and shown to be acceptable and feasible. This study will improve understanding of how best to adapt this model to an LMIC setting, in order to maximize prevention, detection, and management of diabetes. Results may inform policy and practice in the Philippines and have the potential to be applied to other LMICs.

The assessment of movement patterns is clinically useful in individuals with osteoporosis (OP) and osteopenia (OPe) through its potential to optimize fracture risk assessment. This study evaluates the inter-rater reliability of using Dartfish TM 2-D Motion Analysis Software to measure maximum flexion and extension angles at the hip and knee in individuals with OP or OPe while performing five tasks of the Safe Functional Motion test. Twelve participants were videotaped performing the pour, footwear, newspaper, sweep, and sit-to-floor tasks. Five raters used Dartfish TM to analyze maximum flexion and extension angles at the hip and knee, and an intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) and SEM were calculated for each measurement. In all five tasks, ICC and SEM values ranged from 0.23 to 0.95, and 1.75 to 11.54?degrees, respectively, with maximum knee flexion angles generally having higher ICC, and lower SEM point estimates. The results indicate that Dartfish TM measurements of maximum knee flexion angles in uniplanar tasks demonstrate a moderate to excellent degree of inter-rater reliability, while measurements at the hip joint should be used with caution. Given that the results of this study display moderate to excellent reliability, they lay the groundwork for future research aimed at determining the validity of these measurements. Such research would help to further develop the base of evidence surrounding the usefulness of Dartfish TM Motion Analysis in fracture risk analysis among individuals with OP. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis.",Dartfish TM; functional movement; hip; knee; motion analysis; osteopenia; osteoporosis,"aged; biomechanics; computer assisted diagnosis; cross-sectional study; female; hip; human; joint characteristics and functions; knee; male; metabolic bone disease; middle aged; observer variation; osteoporosis; pathophysiology; physical examination; predictive value; procedures; reproducibility; software; videorecording; Aged; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Diseases, Metabolic; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Hip Joint; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Osteoporosis; Physical Examination; Predictive Value of Tests; Range of Motion, Articular; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Video Recording",2-s2.0-85044459927

Low-income countries operating within decentralized systems recognize the role played by sub-national administrative levels (such as districts) in healthcare priority setting. In Uganda, decentralization is a vehicle for facilitating stakeholder participation. Our objective was to examine district-level decision-makers' perspectives on the participation of different stakeholders, including challenges related to their participation. We further sought to understand the leverages that allow these stakeholders to influence priority setting processes. We used an interpretive description methodology involving qualitative interviews. A total of 27 district-level decision-makers from three districts in Uganda were interviewed. Respondents identified the following stakeholder groups: politicians, technical experts, donors, non-governmental organizations (NGO)/civil society organizations (CSO), cultural and traditional leaders, and the public. Politicians, technical experts and donors are the principal contributors to district-level priority setting and the public is largely excluded. The main leverages for politicians were control over the district budget and support of their electorate. Expertise was a cross-cutting leverage for technical experts, donors and NGO/CSOs, while financial and technical resources were leverages for donors and NGO/CSOs. Cultural and traditional leaders' leverages were cultural knowledge and influence over their followers. The public's leverage was indirect and exerted through electoral power. Respondents made no mention of participation for vulnerable groups. The public, particularly vulnerable groups, are left out of the priority setting process for health at the district. Conflicting priorities, interests and values are the main challenges facing stakeholders engaged in district-level priority setting. Our findings have important implications for understanding how different stakeholder groups shape the prioritization process and whether representation can be an effective mechanism for participation in health-system priority setting. ? 2019 The Author(s).",low-income countries (LICs); priority setting; Stakeholder participation; Uganda,adult; article; budget; human; interview; leadership; low income country; non-governmental organization; public figure; qualitative analysis; stakeholder engagement; Uganda; organization,2-s2.0-85072057065

The aim of this pilot study was to determine, in PLWH, the relationship between atherosclerosis assessed by carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and (A) plasma antioxidant micronutrients and oxidative stress or (B) red blood cell polyunsaturated fatty acids (RBC PUFA), particularly long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA). Methods: (A) In a cross-sectional study, subjects had CIMT evaluated by high resolution carotid artery ultrasound. Plasma was collected for vitamin C, measured by spectrophotometry; and alpha-and gamma-tocopherol, retinol, and malondialdehyde—a marker of oxidative stress—using high pressure liquid chromatography and fluorescence spectrophotometry. (B) In a prospective cohort study, other subjects had RBC PUFA measured at baseline, using gas chromatography, and CIMT assessed at baseline and repeated after 2 years. Clinical data was also collected. Results: (A) 91 PLWH participated. Only alpha- and gamma-tocopherol levels were positively correlated with CIMT. In a multivariate analysis, age and systolic blood pressure were significantly associated with CIMT with gamma-tocopherol near significance (p = 0.053). (B) 69 PLWH participated. At baseline, docosahexaenoic acid (n-3 PUFA) and the ratio of docosahexaenoic acid to arachidonic acid (n-6 PUFA) were significantly and negatively correlated with CIMT. However, a multivariate analysis failed to detect a significant relationship either at baseline or 2 years after. Conclusion: In addition to age and systolic blood pressure, atherosclerosis assessed by CIMT might be associated with higher serum gamma-tocopherol levels. There was a non-significant association between CIMT and RBC n-3 PUFA or the ratio of n-3 to n-6 PUFA. ? 2019, MDPI AG.

Design This study used a qualitative descriptive design. Setting The setting for this study was two primary care practice sites located in a large urban area in Ontario, Canada. Participants The sample consisted of community-dwelling older adults aged 70 years and older. Participants were recruited from a convenience sample obtained from 360 clients who participated in the 12-month Health TAPESTRY randomised controlled trial. Methods Semistructured interviews were conducted with 32 older adults either face-to-face or by telephone. Interviews were transcribed verbatim. Data were analysed using a constant comparative approach to develop themes. Results Older adults' perceptions about the Health TAPESTRY programme included (1) the lack of a clear purpose and understanding of how information was shared among providers, (2) mixed positive and negative perceptions of goal-setting and provider follow-up after inhome visits by volunteers, (3) positive impacts such as satisfaction with the primary care team, and (4) the potential for the programme to become a regular programme and applied to other communities and groups. Conclusions Older adults living in the community may benefit from greater primary care support provided through enhanced team-based approaches. Programmes such as Health TAPESTRY facilitate opportunities for older adults to work with primary care providers to meet their self-identified needs. By exploring perceptions of clients, primary care programmes can be further refined and expanded for various populations. ? Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2019. Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC.

Consequently, health professions education has begun to integrate formal quality improvement (QI) training into their curricula. Few instruments exist in the literature that adequately and reliably assess QI-related competencies in learners without the use of multiple, trained raters in the context of healthcare. This paper describes the development and psychometric evaluation of the Beliefs, Attitudes, Skills, and Confidence in Quality Improvement (BASiC-QI) instrument, a?30-item self-assessment tool designed to assess knowledge, skills, and attitudes towards QI. Methods: Sixty first-year medical student participants completed the BASiC-QI and the Quality Improvement Knowledge Application Tool (QIKAT-R) prior to and immediately following a?QI program that challenged learners to engage QI concepts in the context of their own medical education. Measurement properties of the BASiC-QI tool were explored through an exploratory factor analysis and generalizability study. Convergent validity was examined through correlations between BASiC-QI and QIKAT-R scores. Results: Psychometric evaluation of BASiC-QI indicated reliability and validity evidence based on internal structure. Analyses also revealed that BASiC-QI scores were positively correlated with the scores from the QIKAT-R, which stands an indicator of convergent validity. Conclusion: BASiC-QI is a?multidimensional self-assessment tool that may be used to assess beliefs, attitudes, skills, and confidence towards QI. In comparison with existing instruments, BASiC-QI does not require multiple raters or scoring rubrics, serving as an efficient, reliable assessment instrument for educators to examine the impact of QI curricula on learners. ? 2019, The Author(s).",Measurement; Quality improvement; Undergraduate medical education,adult; article; convergent validity; exploratory factor analysis; female; human; human experiment; male; medical education; medical student; occupation; reliability; skill; total quality management,2-s2.0-85067334986

Design and setting A population-based, mailed survey in Finland. Participants Respondents from a random sample of 3000 laypeople, 1500 physicians, 1500 nurses and all 200 members of the parliament (MPs) of Finland. Primary outcome measures Respondents' perspectives on 20 mental health-related states of being as diseases, measuring the extent of agreement with the claim: '[This state of being] is a disease'. Results Of the 6200 people approached, we received 3259 eligible responses (53%). Two conditions (schizophrenia and autism) were considered to be diseases by at least 75% and two states (grief and homosexuality) were considered not to be diseases by at least 75% in each group. A majority (at least 50% in each group) considered seven states as diseases (anorexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, bulimia, depression, generalised anxiety disorder, panic disorder and personality disorder) and three not to be diseases (absence of sexual desire, premature ejaculation and transsexualism). In six states, there was a wide divergence of opinion (alcoholism, drug addiction, gambling addiction, insomnia, social anxiety disorder and work exhaustion). Psychiatrists were significantly more inclined to considering states of being as diseases relative to other groups, followed by non-psychiatric physicians, nurses, MPs and laypeople. Conclusions Respondents agreed that some conditions, such as schizophrenia and autism, are diseases and other states, such as grief and homosexuality, are not; for others, there was considerable disagreement. Psychiatrists are more inclined to consider mental health-related states of being as diseases compared with other physicians, who, in turn, are more inclined than other constituencies.

Scars from multiple aetiologies may cause psychiatric and emotional disturbances, can limit physical functioning and increase costs to the healthcare system. The purpose of this protocol is to describe the methodological considerations that will guide the completion of a scoping review that will summarise the extent, range and nature of psychosocial health outcomes and QOL of scars of all aetiologies. Methods and analysis A modified Arksey and O'Malley (2005) framework will be completed, namely having ongoing consultation between experts from the beginning of the process, then (1) identifying the research question/s, (2) identifying the relevant studies from electronic databases and grey literature, with (3) study selection and (4) charting of data by two independent coders, and (5) collating, summarising and reporting data. Experts will include a health information specialist (TAW), scar expert (JSF), scoping review consultant (SCK), as well as at least two independent coders (NZ, AM). Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval will not be sought for this scoping review.

Identification of efficiencies is vital for decreasing healthcare cost in a resource-limited system. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to characterize the short-term cost associated with all colon and rectal resections. DESIGN: This was a population-based, retrospective administrative analysis. SETTINGS: This analysis was composed of all colon and rectal resections with anastomosis in Canada (excluding Quebec) between 2008 and 2015. PATIENTS: A total of 108,304 patients ?18 years of age who underwent colon and/or rectal resections with anastomosis were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Total short-term inpatient cost for the index admission and the incremental cost of each comorbidity and complication (in 2014 Canadian dollars) were measured. Cost predictors were modeled using hierarchical linear regression and Monte Carlo Markov Chain estimation. RESULTS: Multivariable regression demonstrated that the adjusted average cost of a 50-year-old man undergoing open colon resection for benign disease with no comorbidities or complications was $9270 ((95% CI, $7146-$11,624; p = <0.001). With adjustment for complications, laparoscopic colon resections carried a cost savings of $1390 (95% CI, $1682-$1099; p = <0.001) compared with open resections. Surgical complications were the main driver for increased cost, because anastomotic leaks added $9129 (95% CI, $8583-$9670; p = <0.001). Medical complications such as renal failure requiring dialysis ($16,939 (95% CI, $15,548-$18,314); p = <0.001) carried significant cost. Complications requiring reoperation cost $16,313 (95% CI, $15,739-$16,886; p = <0.001). The costliest complication cumulatively was reoperation, which exceeded $95 million dollars over the course of the study. LIMITATIONS: Inherent biases associated with administrative databases limited this study. CONCLUSIONS: Medical and surgical complications (especially those requiring reoperation) are major drivers of increased resource use. Laparoscopic colorectal resection with or without adjustment for complications carries a clear cost advantage. There is opportunity for considerable cost savings by reducing specific complications or by preoperatively optimizing select patients susceptible to costly complication.

While cultural explanations for inequalities have long been debated in other fields, there exists little critique of cultural discourses in occupational health. Methods: This article examines and discusses the discourse on culture in 107 articles on immigrant or migrant workers’ health published between 2011 and 2015. For each article, passages on culture were identified and analysed for both the context and the manner in which culture was discussed. Results: The discourse on culture was found to be generally simplistic, individualistic, and uncritical, intentionally or unintentionally supporting the worldview that workers’ “otherness” is both cause of inequalities and target for interventions. Conclusion: The article argues that empirical, theoretical and interdisciplinary work is needed to document the mechanisms and pathways that underlie health and safety inequalities by foreign-born status. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",(im)migrants; causal mechanisms; critical discourse analysis; culture; occupational health inequalities,article; discourse analysis; human; immigrant; indigenous people; migrant worker; occupational health; physician; scientist; theoretical study,2-s2.0-85066086295

In this study, we investigated whether maternal experiences of ethnic discrimination were associated with cardiometabolic risk in Hispanic/Latino youth several years later. Methods: Our sample included 1146 youth (8–16 years)from the Study of Latino Youth (2012–2014), who were children of the Hispanic Community Health Study/Study of Latinos participants (2008–2011). We used regression models to examine the prospective associations between maternal report of ethnic discrimination in relation to her child's body mass index (BMI)z-score, metabolic syndrome score (MetS), and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)levels 2 years later. Results: Maternal ethnic discrimination was associated with youth hsCRP, but not BMI or MetS (P-values >.05). Adjusting for age, nativity, and national background, maternal ethnic discrimination was associated with higher (log)hsCRP levels (β = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.32)in children. This association was robust to adjustment for maternal and household characteristics (β = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.04 to 0.31), as well as maternal depression and maternal BMI. Conclusions: Maternal ethnic discrimination is associated with inflammation among Hispanic/Latino youth, and not BMI z-score or MetS.

Rather than treating the self-employed as a homogenous group—a characterization that conflates entrepreneurial ventures with lower quality and more precarious self-employment—we disaggregate self-employment entrants by occupational class. Descriptive analyses show that the nonprofessional self-employed—the most common form of self-employment observed in the study—are considerably more likely to report low income (<$25,000) and insufficient work hours compared to wage workers and the professional self-employed. Event history analyses based on a multinomial logistic model also reveal that poor wage-work quality—including low income, job insecurity, and unchallenging work—increases the likelihood of a transition from wage work into nonprofessional self-employment. In contrast, job autonomy and human capital predict an increased likelihood of a transition into professional self-employment. Our results suggest that both classic entrepreneurial and forced motivations explain self-employment entry when the self-employed's occupational class is distinguished; however, findings are mixed regarding the salience of work-family factors in predicting self-employment entry. We discuss the value of using a “good jobs, bad jobs” perspective to disaggregate the pathways from wage work into lower versus higher quality self-employment. ? 2019 Eastern Sociological Society",economy; entrepreneurship; precariousness; self-employment; wage work; work-family,,2-s2.0-85064698592

It is unclear, however, whether these elements of the disorder represent distinct or related disease processes. Accordingly, this study investigated 3-way interactions between group, cognition and cortical thickness in cognitively-matched patients with schizophrenia and healthy control groups. Patients and healthy controls were group-matched on demographics and a broadly-based index of cognitive performance. T1-weighted images were processed using Freesurfer. Variable selection techniques were applied to determine which regions best predicted 3-way interaction effects. Independent variables included age, sex, IQ, and 87 regional cortical thickness values strongly associated with group or cognition. Antipsychotic treatment effects were also investigated. Twenty regions were selected by the best fitting model. The top 6 regions included the left pre- and post-central, left superior frontal and temporal and right rostral and caudal middle frontal cortices. No antipsychotic treatment effects were seen. Cortical thinning in schizophrenia exists even in the absence of cognitive impairment. Our findings support the separation of psychosis and cognitive impairment as independent disease processes, with distinct relations with cortical thickness in prefrontal cortical areas. Parsing out these two disease processes will increase understanding of heterogeneity in schizophrenia and may modify treatment targets. ? 2019",Cognition; Cortical thickness; MRI; Psychosis; Schizophrenia,neuroleptic agent; neuroleptic agent; adult; Article; brain region; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; correlational study; cortical thickness (brain); disease association; drug effect; female; frontal cortex; human; intelligence quotient; male; mental performance; neuroimaging; priority journal; schizophrenia; temporal cortex; brain cortex; case control study; cognition; cognitive defect; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organ size; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; prefrontal cortex; procedures; schizophrenia; Adult; Antipsychotic Agents; Case-Control Studies; Cerebral Cortex; Cognition; Cognitive Dysfunction; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Size; Prefrontal Cortex; Schizophrenia,2-s2.0-85064263161

Varicoceles are common in adolescent males, generating concerns regarding etiology and management. At our institution, Doppler ultrasound (US) of the renal vessels is routinely obtained with the goal of assessing for an associated nutcracker phenomenon. Methods: Between 1/2000 and 3/2017, 182 patients with clinical varicoceles were evaluated with US. Retrospective assessment provided complete data in 137, including maximum varicose vein diameter, testicular measurements, left renal vein velocities at the hilum and impingement point by the superior mesenteric artery, and procedural interventions. Results: NcP was detected in 77 patients (56.2%), who experienced higher venous velocity ratios (8.33 vs 2.87; P < 0.001) than those without. Overall, 39 patients (28.5%) had a testicular volume discrepancy >20%, without a significant difference based on the presence or absence of NcP (27.3 vs 30.0%, respectively; P = 0.36). Both groups had similar ages at diagnosis, bilateral volume parameters, volume difference, maximum varicose vein sizes, and follow-up duration (P ? 0.05 for all). Intervention was more likely in patients with volume difference >20% (P = 0.014). Having NcP was not associated with a higher incidence of initial (P = 0.59) or reoperative surgery (P = 0.73). Conclusion: NcP is common in adolescent patients with a varicocele, but it is not associated with differences in testicular parameters or an increased frequency of initial or reoperative surgery. As such, NcP may have few clinical ramifications as an isolated finding in this patient population, calling into question routine assessment for its presence. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",,"adolescent; adult; Article; child; controlled study; disease association; follow up; human; incidence; intervention study; major clinical study; male; organ size; population research; prevalence; priority journal; recurrent disease; renal nutcracker syndrome; reoperation; retrospective study; testicular volume; varicocele; vein diameter; diagnostic imaging; Doppler ultrasonography; Ontario; prevalence; procedures; testis; varicocele; Adolescent; Child; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Ontario; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Testis; Ultrasonography, Doppler; Varicocele",2-s2.0-85064070756

This high volatility led to increased mobility and migration due to new labor and economic opportunities, as evidenced by documentary and stable isotope data. This study uses ancient DNA (aDNA) isolated from skeletal remains to examine whether evidence for large-scale population movement can be gleaned from the complete mitochondrial genomes of 264 medieval individuals from England (London) and Denmark. Materials and Methods: Using a novel library-conserving approach to targeted capture, we recovered 264 full mitochondrial genomes from the petrous portion of the temporal bones and teeth and compared genetic diversity across the medieval period within and between English (London) and Danish populations and with contemporary populations through population pairwise Φ ST analysis. Results: We find no evidence of significant differences in genetic diversity spatially or temporally in our dataset, yet there is a high degree of haplotype diversity in our medieval samples with little exact sequence sharing. Discussion: The mitochondrial genomes of both medieval Londoners and medieval Danes suggest high mitochondrial diversity before, during and after the Black Death. While our mitochondrial genomic data lack geographically correlated signals, these data could be the result of high, continual female migration before and after the Black Death or may simply indicate a large female effective population size unaffected by the upheaval of the medieval period. Either scenario suggests a genetic resiliency in areas of northwestern medieval Europe. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",ancient DNA; medieval London and Denmark; migration; mitochondrial DNA,Article; black death; controlled study; Danish citizen; Denmark; DNA sequence; England; Englishman; epidemic; female; genetic variability; haplotype; human; male; Middle Ages; mitochondrial genome; mitochondrial haplogroup; nucleotide sequence; temporal bone; tooth; unindexed sequence,2-s2.0-85064053747

Study design: A retrospective cohort study of singleton term births in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia between 2003 and 2007 followed until age 7 years was conducted using data from the Nova Scotia Atlee Perinatal Database and administrative health data. The main exposure was mode of delivery (cesarean delivery vs vaginal birth); the outcome was healthcare utilization and costs during the first 7 years of life. Associations were modeled using multiple regression adjusting for maternal prepregnancy weight and sociodemographic factors. Results: In total, 32 464 births were included in the analysis. Compared with children born by vaginal birth, children born by cesarean delivery had more physician visits (incidence rate ratio 1.06, 95% CI 1.05-1.08) and longer hospital stays (incidence rate ratio 1.12, 95% CI 1.03-1.21) and were more likely to be high utilizers of physician visits (OR 1.23, 95% CI 1.10-1.37).

The agreement between planning and delivery of low-dose radiation therapy (LD-RT) was assessed with direct comparison to expected doses and tabulated total body irradiation (TBI) calculations. Studies over the past decades indicate that LD-RT has strong potential to be an effective treatment modality for cancer patients with minimal toxicities. This physics-based study aims to provide sufficient conclusions required for prospective clinical studies involving HB irradiation regimes. Specifically, this study may provide reassurance of MU calculation in the Pinnacle system for an upcoming trial regarding nontargeted LD-RT for recurrent prostate cancer. Methods: Water phantom: A plan was created in Pinnacle to deliver 100 cGy to a water phantom with an ion chamber mount. A percent depth dose was obtained. Electrometer readings were recorded with each irradiation of 400 MUs at varying ion chamber depths at extended distance. A percent depth dose was created from tabulated data. Anthropomorphic phantom: A parallel opposed pair plan was created in Pinnacle to deliver 150 cGy over 10 fractions to the umbilicus of the phantom at 4 m extended source-to-surface distance. The MUs required to deliver 150 cGy, as per Pinnacle were delivered to the phantom using 6 MV photons. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD), used to measure exposure using light-emitting crystals, were placed along six reference locations (lung, mid-T-spine, abdomen, mid-pelvis, thigh, and mid-abdomen) on the phantom. TLD measurements were then compared with the Pinnacle-derived ROI mean doses. For experiment 2, TBI calculation factors were used to determine the required MUs to deliver 150 cGy to the prescription (Rx) point. The calculated MUs were delivered, and TLD readings were recorded to compare the level of agreement of using TBI calculations for HB treatments. Results: Water phantom: Pinnacle did not accurately estimate dmax at extended distance; however, it did accurately estimate the dose past dmax. Anthropomorphic phantom: A 10% variation to expected dose was deemed significant. Both Pinnacle and TBI calculations were accurate methods of planning HB LD-RT treatment, with insignificant difference. Pinnacle's overall average variation across ROIs was borderline significant at 12.1%. Conclusion: At extended source-to-surface distance, Pinnacle inaccurately estimated the entrance dose and dmax. Anthropomorphic phantom studies indicated borderline significant variation, as per the implemented 10% limit. TBI calculations presented similar conclusions. For purposes of HB LD-RT, a borderline 10% variation will have insignificant impact to the patient's ability to tolerate treatment. Trial-eligible prostate cancer patients are currently being treated for HB LD-RT at the Juravinski Cancer Centre. ? 2019",hemibody irradiation; low-dose radiation therapy; Radiation hormesis; treatment planning,abdomen; Article; cancer radiotherapy; comparative study; controlled study; dosimetry; human; immune response; low energy radiation; lung; measurement accuracy; nonhodgkin lymphoma; pelvis; priority journal; radiotherapy dosage; spine; thigh; whole body radiation; x-ray computed tomography,2-s2.0-85061451577

In this multicenter, prospective, open-label controlled trial, adult de novo RTRs were randomized in a 2?×?2 design to low- vs standard-dose (LOW vs STD) prolonged-release tacrolimus and to angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin II receptor 1 blockers (ACEi/ARBs) vs other antihypertensive therapy (OAHT). There were 2 coprimary endpoints: the prevalence of IF/TA at month 6 and at month 24. IF/TA prevalence was similar for LOW vs STD tacrolimus at month 6 (36.8% vs 39.5%; P?=.80) and ACEi/ARBs vs OAHT at month 24 (54.8% vs 58.2%; P?=.33). IF/TA progression decreased significantly with LOW vs STD tacrolimus at month 24 (mean [SD] change, +0.42 [1.477] vs +1.10 [1.577]; P?=.0039). Across the 4 treatment groups, LOW?+?ACEi/ARB patients exhibited the lowest mean IF/TA change and, compared with LOW?+?OAHT patients, experienced significantly delayed time to first T cell–mediated rejection. Renal function was stable from month 1 to month 24 in all treatment groups. No unexpected safety findings were detected. Coupled with LOW tacrolimus dosing, ACEi/ARBs appear to reduce IF/TA progression and delay rejection relative to reduced tacrolimus exposure without renin-angiotensin system blockade.

Purpose: To determine the cost-effectiveness and impact on clinical management of noncontrast MRI in pediatric patients with suspected appendiceal abscess, both pre- and postappendectomy. Study Type: Retrospective cohort study. Population: In all, 82 children under the age of 18 years with suspected appendiceal abscess on ultrasound. Field Strength/Sequence: Diffusion-weighted imaging and T2-weighted single-shot fast spin-echo imaging of the abdomen and pelvis at 1.5T and 3T. Assessment: The presence, location, size, and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of fluid collections and the presence of a drainage path was noted by three pediatric radiologists. Imaging time, completeness of the exam, and impact on clinical management was recorded. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated for MRI relative to CT, taking into account hospital charges, radiation exposure, and risk of adverse reaction to iodinated contrast. Statistical Tests: Descriptive statistics were used. Intraclass correlation coefficient and Fleiss' kappa were used to assess interobserver variation. Proportions were compared using Fisher's exact test (statistical significance at P &lt; 0.05). Results: MRI confirmed the presence of collections in most cases, with alternative diagnosis established in 10 patients (Tubo-ovarian abscess n = 7, Crohn's disease, ileal anastomotic leak, and Birkitts lymphoma each n = 1). MRI showed the presence of a safe drainage pathway in 92–97% of pelvic abscesses and 86–98% of abdominal abscesses compared with 7–10% and 75–81%, respectively, for ultrasound. MR was cost-effective compared with CT, taking into account the direct charges, risk of radiation induced cancer, and adverse reaction to iodinated contrast.

Objectives: To determine whether treatment-seeking children and adolescents with obesity cluster into phenotypes based on known eating behaviours and appetitive traits (“eating correlates”) and how socio-demographic and clinical characteristics associate with different phenotypes. Methods: A cross-sectional, multi-centre questionnaire was administered between November 2015 and March 2017 examining correlates of eating in children and adolescents attending weight-management programmes in Canada. Latent profile analysis was used to cluster participants based on seven eating correlate scores obtained from questionnaires. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine phenotype differences on socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Multinomial logistic regression models assessed relative risk of specific characteristics associating with a disordered eating phenotype. Results: Participants were 247 children and adolescents (45.3% male, mean BMI z-score = 3.4 ± 1.0 kg/m2) from six paediatric weight management centres in Canada. Seven eating correlates clustered into three distinct phenotypes: (1) loss of control eating, emotional eating, external eating, hyperphagia, impulsivity (“Mixed-Severe”; n = 42, 17%), (2) loss of control eating, emotional eating, external eating, hyperphagia (“Mixed-Moderate”; n = 138, 55.9%), and (3) impulsivity (“Impulsive”; n = 67; 27.1%). Social functioning scores and body esteem were significantly different across groups, with the Mixed-Severe participants having the poorest social functioning and lowest body esteem. Low body esteem indicated a greater risk of being in a multi-correlate group compared to the Impulsive group, while poor social function had a greater risk of clustering in the Mixed-Severe than Impulsive phenotype. Conclusions: Distinct eating phenotypes were found in treatment-seeking children and adolescents with obesity. Empirical evidence is needed, but these data suggest that tailored treatment approaches could be informed by these classifications to improve weight-management outcomes. ? 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",,adolescent; adolescent obesity; Article; body mass; body weight management; child; childhood obesity; controlled study; correlational study; cross-sectional study; demography; disease severity; eating disorder; emotional eating; feeding behavior; female; help seeking behavior; human; hyperphagia; impulsiveness; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; phenotype; physical activity; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; social interaction; social status,2-s2.0-85058860421

Worldwide, a third of ischemic heart disease is due to abnormal cholesterol levels and it is the most common cause of cardiovascular deaths in Colombia. In Colombia, no representative, large-scale study has assessed the prevalence of dyslipidemia. The aim of the present analysis was to identify the magnitude of the problem in Colombia, a middle-income-country with large regional, geographic, and socio-economical differences. Material and methods: The sample comprised 6628 individuals aged 35 to 70 years (mean age 50.7 years, 64.1% women) residing in the four Colombian regions. Results: The overall prevalence of dyslipidemia was 87.7% and was substantially higher among participants older than 50 years, male, rural residents, and those with a lower level of education (66.8%), and with a lower income (66.4%). High non HDL-c was the most common abnormality (75.3%). The values of total cholesterol and non-HDL-cholesterol were higher in areas with the lowest health needs index than in the areas with intermediate and highest health need index, the isolated HDL-c value was much lower. Conclusion: Colombia has a high prevalence of abnormalities of the lipid profile. The causes of the high rates of dyslipidemia were not well define in this study, but were more common in rural and poorer regions and among those with lower socio-economical status. Strategies to tackle the adverse lipid profile to reduce CVD are needed in Colombia, particularly in rural areas and among the areas with the higher health need index. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Cardiovascular disease; Colombia; Dyslipidemia; Prevalence,high density lipoprotein cholesterol; lipid; adult; aged; Article; cholesterol blood level; Colombia; Colombian; dyslipidemia; educational status; female; geography; health care need; human; lowest income group; major clinical study; male; middle income country; prevalence; priority journal; rural population; social status; age distribution; blood; clinical trial; dyslipidemia; follow up; middle aged; multicenter study; procedures; prospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; rural population; urban population; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Colombia; Dyslipidemias; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Lipids; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Rural Population; Urban Population,2-s2.0-85056998732

SCD is prevalent in the southern and eastern provinces of the Arabian peninsula. The most common complications for individuals with SCD are acute painful episodes that require several doses of intravenous opioids, making pain control for these individuals challenging. Instead of opioids, some studies have suggested that ketamine might be used for pain control in acute pain episodes of individuals with SCD. This study aims to evaluate whether the addition of ketamine to morphine can achieve better pain control, decreasing the number of repeated doses of opiates. We hypothesize that early administration of ketamine would lead to a more rapid improvement in pain score and lower opioid requirements. Methods and analysis: This study will be a prospective, randomized, concealed, blinded, pragmatic parallel group, controlled trial enrolling adult patients with SCD and acute vaso-occlusive crisis pain. All patients will receive standard analgesic therapy during evaluation. Patients randomized to the treatment arm will receive low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg in 0.9% sodium chloride, 100 ml bag) in addition to standard intravenous hydration, while those in the control group will receive a standard dose of morphine (0.1 mg/kg in 0.9% sodium chloride, 100 ml bag) in addition to the standard intravenous hydration. All healthcare providers will be blinded to the treatment arm. Data will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle.

In 2018, many states have legalized marijuana use for both medical and recreational purposes, thus exploring the evidence behind medical marijuana use became essential. Muslim majority countries enforce rigorous rules as marijuana has been a long-debated issue due to the stigma associated with its use as a treatment. Marijuana has a high beneficial effect in managing chronic pain in adults and relieving spasticity symptoms in multiple sclerosis, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, and fibromyalgia. As well as, used as pain management, and as anti-emetic in treatment of chemotherapy-induced vomiting and nausea. Marijuana is requested from more than one-third of posttraumatic stress disorder patients due to its significant clinical improvement in nightmares and subsidence disorder symptoms. Marijuana adversely affects the body's resistance to many infections, compromising their immune response. Its recreational use has led to an increasing trend in the occurrence of major acute cardiovascular events as stroke, epilepsy, acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and arrhythmia. Conclusion: Many countries started to allow medicinal use of marijuana due to its beneficial effect in managing chronic pain, spasticity symptoms in multiple sclerosis, obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, fibromyalgia, and posttraumatic stress disorder. But literature lacks benefit-harm analysis for marijuana usage in medicine. Therefore, evidence-based report of short- and long-term health effects of marijuana use - both harmful and beneficial effects - is crucial for further marijuana prescription in healthcare settings. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Marijuana; Medical; Pain; Patients; PTSD; Treatment,cannabis; medical cannabis; recreational drug; acute heart infarction; cannabis use; cerebrovascular accident; chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting; chronic pain; congestive heart failure; epilepsy; fibromyalgia; heart arrhythmia; human; immune response; infection resistance; major adverse cardiac event; multiple sclerosis; nightmare; posttraumatic stress disorder; Review; sleep disordered breathing; spasticity; symptomatology,2-s2.0-85066482563

Warfarin and non–vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are underused and often underdosed in the prevention of stroke in older patients with atrial fibrillation because of concerns about the risk of bleeding. Poor adherence to anticoagulant therapy is also an issue for older patients with atrial fibrillation and those at risk of recurrent pulmonary embolism. In this review, we present 5 clinical cases to illustrate common challenges with anticoagulant use in older patients and discuss our approach to institute safe and effective antithrombotic therapy. ? 2019 by The American Society of Hematology.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; anticoagulant agent; apixaban; atorvastatin; creatinine; dabigatran; edoxaban; hemoglobin; hydrochlorothiazide; metformin; ramipril; rivaroxaban; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; warfarin; African American; aged; all cause mortality; anticoagulant therapy; anticoagulation; Article; atrial fibrillation; awareness; blood pressure; brain hemorrhage; bypass surgery; case report; cerebrovascular accident; CHA2DS2-VASc score; chronic kidney failure; clinical article; comorbidity; computer assisted tomography; congestive heart failure; coronary artery disease; creatinine clearance; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug substitution; dual antiplatelet therapy; dysphasia; dyspnea; female; follow up; health care personnel; health care system; hemiparesis; human; hypertension; international normalized ratio; kidney disease; kidney function; leg thrombosis; lung angiography; macular degeneration; male; medication compliance; middle cerebral artery; mild cognitive impairment; New York Heart Association class; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; osteoarthritis; priority journal; prostate hypertrophy; pulse rate; risk assessment; risk factor; social isolation; stable angina pectoris; thorax pain; treatment refusal; urine retention; vascular disease; venous thromboembolism; very elderly; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; complication; oral drug administration; pathology; treatment outcome; venous thromboembolism; Administration, Oral; Aged; Anticoagulants; Atrial Fibrillation; Female; Humans; Male; Risk Factors; Stroke; Treatment Outcome; Venous Thromboembolism; Warfarin",2-s2.0-85066919600

While there are no United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved medications for these symptoms, off-label use of medications such as antipsychotics have been shown to have significant adverse effects including increased mortality. The goal of this review is to examine the efficacy and safety of anticonvulsants in the treatment of BPSD. Methods: We will systematically search for randomized trials of anticonvulsants compared to placebo or other treatments such as antidepressants and antipsychotics from the following sources: The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE (OVID SP) in Process and Other Non-Indexed Citations (latest version), EMBASE, clinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO Clinical Trials Registry. The studies will be limited to those published in English but the study location can be worldwide. We will include studies pertaining to individuals with dementia and symptoms of BPSD. The primary outcomes will be behavioral change as measured by validated scales and secondary outcomes will include caregiver burden, quality of life, placement in long term care facility, serious adverse effects, and treatment discontinuation due to adverse effects. Two sets of reviewers will independently screen select and extract data. We will narratively describe the major findings and conclusions from individual studies. Patients who are prescribed antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) for other indications, including seizures, will be excluded. Outcomes of interest will include a change in a validated scale that measures BPSD, serious adverse events, and caregiver quality of life outcomes. If the data are found to be appropriate for a meta-analysis, we will use a random effects model to compute summary estimates of treatment effects. Discussion: This is a protocol for a systematic review addressing the anticonvulsant group of medications as a whole, and as such, our results will inform current clinical practice in the use of anticonvulsants for BPSD. It will also help clinicians and policy makers compare the efficacy of anticonvulsants compared to antidepressants and antipsychotics as well as identify areas which will need further study. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Agitation; Anticonvulsants; Behavioral and psychological symptoms; Dementia; Major neurocognitive disorder; Neuropsychiatric symptoms,anticonvulsive agent; carbamazepine; gabapentin; lamotrigine; levetiracetam; neuroleptic agent; oxcarbazepine; phenobarbital; phenytoin; placebo; pregabalin; topiramate; valproic acid; zonisamide; behavior change; behavior disorder; Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; caregiver burden; Clinical Global Impression scale; Cohen Mansfield Agitation Inventory; dementia; geriatric assessment; health care cost; human; information processing; long term care; mental disease; meta analysis; Mini Mental State Examination; morbidity; mortality; neuropsychiatric inventory; off label drug use; outcome assessment; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; priority journal; quality of life; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review,2-s2.0-85065890043

However, these initiatives are not systematic. Since the implementation of EIHP is not consistent and the interventions in this regard are complex, a comprehensive plan could be a useful tool for employing initiatives to achieve and promote EIHP. Hence, this study aims to develop a roadmap for strengthening EIHP over a 3-year period in Iran. Methods: Nine projects will be conducted to define the roadmap for strengthening EIHP. These projects include two reviews and a stakeholder analysis to identify the factors that facilitate or hinder achieving EIHP. The next study will be a qualitative study to prioritise the challenges and outline the main causes. The following steps will be a review of reviews to extract global experiences on interventions used for strengthening EIHP and two qualitative studies to examine the adoption of these interventions and develop an operational plan for strengthening EIHP in Iran. The research will be completed through conducting two qualitative-quantitative studies to design a tool for measuring EIHP and assessing EIHP in Iran at baseline. Discussion: This national EIHP roadmap will surely be able to identify the gaps and bumps that might exist in the implementation plan for establishing EIHP and eliminate them as needed in the future. This roadmap can be a step in moving towards transparency and accountability in the health system and as thus towards good governance and improvement of the health system's performance. Although the plan can be a good model for developing countries and may promote the use of evidence in health policy-making, we should assume that there are some critical contextual factors that could potentially hinder the complete and successful implementation of EIHP. Thus, to enhance EIHP in these countries with a policy-making context that does not fully support the use of evidence, it is crucial to think about not only those interventions that directly address the EIHP barriers, but also some long-term strategies to make required changes in the context, both beyond and within the health system. ? 2019 The Author(s).",evidence-based practice; Evidence-informed health policy-making; Iran,adoption; article; developing country; health care policy; human; Iran; management; qualitative research; quantitative analysis; developing country; evidence based practice; government; health care delivery; interpersonal communication; Iran; management; medical research; social responsibility; Biomedical Research; Delivery of Health Care; Developing Countries; Disclosure; Evidence-Based Practice; Government Programs; Health Policy; Humans; Iran; Policy Making; Social Responsibility,2-s2.0-85065915088

These comparisons are further complicated by the impact of using different study designs, multimorbidity definitions and data sources. The aim of this paper is to share insights on multimorbidity and associated health services use and costs by reflecting on the common patterns across 3 parallel studies in distinct disease cohorts (diabetes, dementia, and stroke) that used the same study design and were conducted in the same health jurisdiction over the same time period. Methods: We present findings that lend to broader Insights regarding multimorbidity based on the relationship between comorbidity and health service use and costs seen across three distinct disease cohorts. These cohorts were originally created using multiple linked administrative databases to identify community-dwelling residents of Ontario, Canada with one of diabetes, dementia, or stroke in 2008 and each was followed for health service use and associated costs. Results: We identified 376,434 indviduals wtih diabetes, 95,399 wtih dementia, and 29,671 with stroke. Four broad insights were identified from considering the similarity in comorbidity, utilization and cost patterns across the three cohorts: 1) the most prevalent comorbidity types were hypertension and arthritis, which accounted for over 75% of comorbidity in each cohort; 2) overall utilization increased consistently with the number of comorbidities, with the vast majority of services attributed to comorbidity rather than the index conditions; 3) the biggest driver of costs for those with lower levels of comorbidity was community-based care, e.g., home care, GP visits, but at higher levels of comorbidity the driver was acute care services; 4) service-specific comorbidity and age patterns were consistent across the three cohorts. Conclusions: Despite the differences in population demographics and prevalence of the three index conditions, there are common patterns with respect to comorbidity, utilization, and costs. These common patterns may illustrate underlying needs of people with multimorbidity that are often obscured in literature that is still single disease-focused. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Community-living older adults; Comorbidity; Health service costs; Health service utilization; Multimorbidity,"aged; arthritis; cerebrovascular accident; comorbidity; dementia; diabetes mellitus; economics; female; health care cost; health service; human; hypertension; male; methodology; multiple chronic conditions; Ontario; patient attitude; prevalence; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthritis; Comorbidity; Dementia; Diabetes Mellitus; Female; Health Care Costs; Health Services; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Multimorbidity; Ontario; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Prevalence; Research Design; Stroke",2-s2.0-85065887643

Objectives of this mid-study report are to describe patient and physician recruitment characteristics, glucocorticoid prescriptions, use of second line agents, biopsy practices, and adherence to study protocol. Methods: Children with new onset nephrotic syndrome and providers are being recruited from all 12 pediatric nephrology centres across Canada with > 2 years follow-up. Data collection points of observation are over a minimum 36 months. Details of prescribed glucocorticoids and of all second line agents used during treatment are being collected. All relapses are being recorded with time to urinary remission of proteinuria. Results: To date, 243 patients (57.1% male) from 12 centres were included. Median number of patients per centre was 29 (range 2-45), and median age of cohort was 7.3 (IQR 4.2) at enrollment. Forty-eight physicians were recruited, median 5 (range 2-8) per site. Median number of relapses per patient year of follow-up was 2.1 (IQR 4). Cumulative dose variability of glucocorticoids prescribed per episode of proteinuria and length of treatment was observed between participating centres. Conclusion: The Canadian pediatric nephrology community established a longitudinal childhood nephrotic syndrome cohort study that confirms ongoing practice variability. The study will help to evaluate its impact on patient outcomes, and facilitate clinical trial implementation in nephrotic syndrome. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Children; Glucocorticoids; Longitudinal study; Nephrotic syndrome; Practice variation,glucocorticoid; Article; child; clinical practice; cohort analysis; continuing education; controlled study; drug use; feasibility study; female; follow up; health care personnel; health care planning; human; human tissue; kidney biopsy; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; nephrotic syndrome; observational study; onset age; patient attitude; patient compliance; physician attitude; prescription; proteinuria; protocol compliance; remission; school child; treatment duration; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85065723645

In healthy organisms, activated microglia promote recovery through the release of trophic and anti-inflammatory factors to clear toxins and pathogens and support neuronal survival. Chronically activated microglia, however, release toxic substances, including excess glutamate, causing cytotoxicity. Accordingly, rising attention is given to microglia for their role in abnormal physiology and in mediating neurotoxicity.Objectives:To examine the nociceptive relationship between peripherally-released glutamate and microglial xCT.Methods:A validated murine model of 4T1 carcinoma cell-induced nociception was used to assess the effect of peripheral tumour on spinal microglial activation and xCT expression. Coculture systems were then used to investigate the direct effect of glutamate released by wildtype and xCT knockdown MDA-MB-231 carcinoma cells on microglial activation, functional system xC2 activity, and protein levels of interferon regulatory factor 8 (IRF8), a transcription factor implicated in microglia-mediated nociception.Results:Blockade of system xC2 with sulfasalazine (SSZ) in vivo attenuated nociception in a 4T1 murine model of CIP and attenuates tumour-induced microglial activation in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Furthermore, knockdown of xCT in MDA-MB-231 cells mitigated tumour cell-induced microglial activation and functional system xC2 activity in vitro.Conclusions:These data collectively demonstrate that the system xCT antiporter is functionally implicated in CIP and may be particularly relevant to pain progression through microglia. Upregulated xCT in chronically activated spinal microglia may be one pathway to central glutamate cytotoxicity. Microglial xCT may therefore be a valuable target for mitigating CIP. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cancer; Microglia; Nociception; Pain; SLC7A11; System xC-; xCT,,2-s2.0-85071118998

Methods: A FAM84B mutant with deletion of its HRASLS domain (ΔHRASLS) was constructed. DU145 prostate cancer (PC) cells stably expressing an empty vector (EV), FAM84B, or FAM84B (ΔHRASLS) were produced. These lines were examined for proliferation, invasion, and growth in soft agar in vitro. DU145 EV and FAM84B cells were investigated for tumor growth and lung metastasis in NOD/SCID mice. The transcriptome of DU145 EV xenografts (n = 2) and DU145 FAM84B tumors (n = 2) was determined using RNA sequencing, and analyzed for pathway alterations. The FAM84B-affected network was evaluated for an association with PC recurrence. Results: FAM84B but not FAM84B (ΔHRASLS) increased DU145 cell invasion and growth in soft agar. Co-immunoprecipitation and co-localization analyses revealed an interaction between FAM84B and FAM84B (ΔHRASLS), suggesting an intramolecular association among FAM84B molecules. FAM84B significantly enhanced DU145 cell-derived xenografts and lung metastasis. In comparison with DU145 EV cell-produced tumors, those generated by DU145 FAM84B cells showed a large number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs; n = 4976). A total of 51 pathways were enriched in these DEGs, which function in the Golgi-to-endoplasmic reticulum processes, cell cycle checkpoints, mitochondrial events, and protein translation. A novel 27-gene signature (SigFAM) was derived from these DEGs; SigFAM robustly stratifies PC recurrence in two large PC populations (n = 490, p = 0; n = 140, p = 4e?11), and remains an independent risk factor of PC recurrence after adjusting for age at diagnosis, Gleason scores, surgical margin, and tumor stages. Conclusions: FAM84B promotes prostate tumorigenesis through a complex network that predicts PC recurrence. ?

Design We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews (healthcare professionals) and focus groups (adults living with HIV). We asked participants their perspectives on barriers, facilitators and strategies to accessing and participating in outpatient PT, important characteristics physiotherapists should possess working in outpatient HIV care, content and structure of PT delivery, and programme evaluation. Recruitment and setting We purposively sampled healthcare professionals based on their experiences working in interprofessional HIV care and recruited adults with HIV via word of mouth and in collaboration with an HIV-specialty hospital in Toronto, Canada. Interviews were conducted via Skype or in-person and focus groups were conducted in-person at the HIV-specialty hospital. Participants 12 healthcare professionals with a median of 12 years experience in HIV care, and 13 adults living with HIV (11 men and 2 women) with a median age of 50 years and living with a median of 6 concurrent health conditions in addition to HIV. Results Overall impressions of PT in outpatient HIV care and factors to consider when implementing PT into an interprofessional care setting include: promoting the role of, and evidence for, PT in outpatient HIV care, structuring PT delivery to accommodate the unique needs and priorities of adults living with HIV, working collaboratively with a physiotherapist on the healthcare team and evaluating rehabilitation as a component of interprofessional care. Conclusions Multiple factors exist for consideration when implementing PT into an interprofessional outpatient HIV care setting.

Corneal collagen cross-linking (CXL) increases the biomechanical rigidity of the cornea and has been shown to halt ectatic processes. The established CXL protocol requires removal of the corneal epithelium. However, some surgeons have proposed transepithelial approaches to enhance patient recovery and minimise adverse events. Whether novel transepithelial approaches are as effective in arresting ectasia as the established epithelium-off protocol remains unclear. This study will systematically review the evidence on transepithelial CXL approaches and compare it to the epithelium-off protocol. Methods and analysis: We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing transepithelial and epithelium-off CXL for any corneal ectasia. We will search 16 electronic databases including MEDLINE and Embase, as well as the grey literature. Two reviewers will independently screen search results to identify eligible studies, complete data abstraction and conduct quality assessment. We will assess the quality of individual RCTs using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. Our primary outcome will be the change in maximal keratometry at 12 months after treatment, and we will examine 11 additional outcomes. We will summarise our analyses by measures of association (relative risk or odds ratio) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences with 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be conducted to explore heterogeneity. The overall quality of evidence will be rated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach.

Approximately 17.8 million incident cases of typhoid fever occur annually, and incidence is highest in children. The accuracy of current diagnostic tests of typhoid fever is poorly understood. We aimed to determine the comparative accuracy of available tests for the pediatric population. Methods We first conducted a systematic literature review to identify studies that compared diagnostic tests for typhoid fever in children (aged ?15 years) to blood culture results. We applied a Bayesian latent-class extension to a network meta-analysis model. We modelled known diagnostic properties of bone marrow culture and the relationship between bone marrow and blood culture as informative priors in a Bayesian framework. We tested sensitivities for the proportion of negative blood samples that were false as well as bone marrow sensitivity and specificity. Results We found 510 comparisons from 196 studies and 57 specific to the pediatric population. IgM-based tests outperformed their IgG-based counterparts for ELISA and Typhidot tests. The lateral flow IgG test performed comparatively well with 92% sensitivity (72% to 98% across scenario analyses) and 94% specificity. The most sensitive test of those investigated for the South Asian pediatric population was the Reverse Passive Hemagglutination Assay with 99% sensitivity (98%-100% across scenario analyses). Adding a Widal slide test to other typhoid diagnostics did not substantially improve diagnostic performance beyond the single test alone, however, a lateral flow-based IgG rapid test combined with the typhoid/ paratyphoid (TPT) assay yielded improvements in sensitivity without substantial declines in specificity and was the best performing combination test in this setting. Conclusion In the pediatric population, lateral-flow IgG, TPT and Reverse Passive Hemagglutination tests had high diagnostic accuracy compared to other diagnostics. Combinations of tests may provide a feasible option to increase diagnostic sensitivity. South Asia has the most informed set of data on typhoid diagnostic testing accuracy, and the evidence base in other important regions needs to be expanded. ? 2019 Arora et al.",,"blood group H antigen; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; bacterium antibody; Article; blood culture; bone marrow biopsy; bone marrow culture; diagnostic accuracy; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; hemagglutination; human; immunoassay; meta analysis; paratyphoid fever; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi; sensitivity and specificity; systematic review; typhoid fever; adolescent; Bayes theorem; blood; child; comparative study; devices; diagnostic kit; diagnostic test; female; genetics; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; preschool child; procedures; typhoid fever; young adult; Adolescent; Antibodies, Bacterial; Bayes Theorem; Child; Child, Preschool; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Female; Humans; Male; Reagent Kits, Diagnostic; Salmonella typhi; Sensitivity and Specificity; Typhoid Fever; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85066457463

Our study sought to examine: 1) physician comfort with supervision and assessment, 2) what the current training gaps are within these competencies, and 3) what barriers or enablers might exist in implementing curricular improvements.Methods Qualitative data were collected in two phases through individual interviews from September 2016 to November 2017, at the University of Toronto and McMaster University after receiving ethics approval from both sites. Eligible participants were final year emergency medicine residents, residents pursuing an enhanced skills program in emergency medicine, and attendings within their first 3 years of practice. A semi-structured interview guide was developed and refined after phase one, to reflect content identified in the first set of interviews. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, and collapsed into themes. Data analysis was guided by constructivist grounded theory.Results A thematic analysis revealed five themes: 1) Supervision and assessment skills were acquired passively through modelling, 2) the training available in these areas is variably used, creating a diversity of comfort levels, 3) competing priorities in the emergency department represent significant barriers to improving supervision and assessment; 4) providing negative feedback is difficult and often avoided; and 5) competence by design will act as an impetus for formal curriculum development in these areas.Conclusions As programs transition to competence by design, there will be a need for formal training in supervision and assessment, with a focus on negative feedback, to achieve a standardized level of competence among emergency physicians. ? 2019 Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians.",Assessment; competence by design; emergency medicine; feedback; supervision,adult; article; comfort; curriculum development; data analysis; emergency medicine; emergency physician; emergency ward; ethics; genetic transcription; grounded theory; human; negative feedback; resident; semi structured interview; skill; thematic analysis,2-s2.0-85066456328

Resultant complications include infection, progressive liver disease and cancer. While diagnosis relies extensively on imaging, the role of imaging in determining prognosis is unclear. The aim of this study was to systematically review existing imaging indices and features that predict PSC progression. Materials and Methods: We performed a systematic review of imaging features that predict PSC progression. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Clinicaltrials.gov and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to November 2018 for relevant studies. Pertinent data were extracted and assessed. Study quality was evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS). Results: The search returned 2504 results. Nine studies were included in the final review. Four studies evaluated the prognostic value of imaging features and five evaluated prognostic algorithms. The mean NOS score was 4.44 ± 0.98 on a scale of 0 to 9. Imaging features that were of prognostic value were degree of intrahepatic duct narrowing, the presence of a dominant biliary duct stricture and percentage of narrowed intraheptic ducts. Three imaging indices (one endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)-based and two magnetic resonance-based) had been derived. The ERCP index was validated in a second cohort and subsequently updated to improve its predictive ability. The magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) index was validated in two studies and was found to be predicative of transplant-free survival. A modified MRCP index (MRCP-risk score) was evaluated in a prospective multicenter study and was found to be predicative of PSC-related disease progression. Conclusion: In conclusion, ERCP and MRCP-based indices have short-term prognostic value in PSC. However, more studies are required to validate their predictability of disease-related progression, such as liver decompensation, ascending cholangitis, cholangiocarcinoma and liver transplantation. ? 2019 Saudi Journal of Gastroenterology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.",Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; magnetic resonance imaging; score; survival; transplant-free survival,algorithm; cholestasis; clinical feature; disease exacerbation; endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography; evidence based medicine; human; magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; prediction; primary sclerosing cholangitis; prognosis; Review; scoring system; survival; systematic review; validation process,2-s2.0-85066163685

Namibia is targeting malaria elimination by 2020. To support decision making regarding targeted intervention, we examined for the first time, the foci of Plasmodium species infections and regional prevalence in northern Namibia, using nested and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods. Methods We used cross-sectional multi-staged sampling to select 952 children below 9 years old from schools and clinics in seven districts in northern Namibia, to assess the presence of Plasmodium species. Results The median participant age was 6 years (25–75%ile 4–8 y). Participants had a median hemoglobin of 12.0 g/dL (25–75%ile 11.1–12.7 g/dL), although 21% of the cohort was anemic, with anemia being severer in the younger population (p<0.002). Most of children with Plasmodium infection were asymptomatic (63.4%), presenting a challenge for elimination. The respective parasite prevalence for Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), Plasmodium vivax (Pv) and Plasmodium ovale curtisi (Po) were (4.41%, 0.84% and 0.31%); with Kavango East and West (10.4%, 6.19%) and Ohangwena (4.5%) having the most prevalence. Pv was localized in Ohangwena, Omusati and Oshana, while Po was found in Kavango. All children with Pv/ Pf coinfections in Ohangwena, had previously visited Angola, affirming that perennial migrations are risks for importation of Plasmodium species. The mean hemoglobin was lower in those with Plasmodium infection compared to those without (0.96 g/dL less, 95%CI 0.40– 1.52 g/dL less, p = 0.0009) indicating that quasi-endemicity exists in the low transmission setting. Conclusions We conclude that Pv and Po species are present in northern Namibia. Additionally, the higher number of asymptomatic infections present challenges to the efforts at elimination for the country. Careful planning, coordination with neighboring Angola and execution of targeted active intervention, will be required for a successful elimination agenda. ? 2019 Haiyambo et al.",,"hemoglobin; protozoal DNA; anemia; Article; asymptomatic infection; child; cross-sectional study; female; geographic distribution; human; male; mixed infection; molecular diagnosis; Namibia; nested polymerase chain reaction; Plasmodium ovale; Plasmodium ovale malaria; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; prevalence; questionnaire; real time polymerase chain reaction; travel; asymptomatic disease; genetics; infant; isolation and purification; malaria; parasitology; Plasmodium ovale; Plasmodium vivax; Plasmodium vivax malaria; polymerase chain reaction; preschool child; Asymptomatic Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; DNA, Protozoan; Female; Humans; Infant; Malaria; Malaria, Vivax; Male; Namibia; Plasmodium ovale; Plasmodium vivax; Polymerase Chain Reaction",2-s2.0-85066160294

Oxidative stress, caused by inflammation and ischemia-reperfusion injury, is associated with these procedures, increasing the risk of adverse outcomes. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) acts as an antioxidant by replenishing the glutathione stores, and emerging evidence suggests that NAC may reduce the risk of adverse perioperative outcomes. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the addition of NAC to a standard of care among adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods We searched four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, LILACS) from inception to October 2018 and the grey literaure for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effect of NAC on pre-defined outcomes including mortality, acute renal insufficiency (ARI), acute cardiac insufficiency (ACI), hospital length of stay (HLoS), intensive care unit length of stay (ICULoS), arrhythmia and acute myocardial infarction (AMI). Reviewers independently screened potentially eligible articles, extracted data and assessed the risk of bias among eligible articles. We used the GRADE approach to rate the overall certainty of evidence for each outcome. Results Twenty-nine RCTs including 2,486 participants proved eligible. Low to moderate certainty evidence demonstrated that the addition of NAC resulted in a non-statistically significant reduction in mortality (Risk Ratio (RR) 0.71; 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.40 to 1.25), ARI (RR 0.92; 95% CI 0.79 to 1.09), ACI (RR 0.77; 95% CI 0.44 to 1.38), HLoS (Mean Difference (MD) 0.21; 95% CI -0.64 to 0.23), ICULoS (MD -0.04; 95% CI -0.29 to 0.20), arrhythmia (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.52 to 1.20), and AMI (RR 0.84; 95% CI 0.48 to 1.48). Limitations Among eligible trials, we observed heterogeneity in the population and interventions including patients with and without kidney dysfunction and interventions that differed in route of administration, dosage, and duration of treatment. This observed heterogeneity was not explained by our subgroup analyses. Conclusions The addition of NAC during cardiac surgery did not result in a statistically significant reduction in clinical outcomes. A large randomized placebo-controlled multi-centre trial is needed to determine whether NAC reduces mortality. ? 2019 Pereira et al.

Methods: All academic centers and children’s hospitals in the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium (PBTC) scanned a phantom developed by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging Clinical Trials Network (SNMMI CTN) for the validation of brain PET studies associated with clinical trials. The phantom comprises 2 separate, fillable sections: a resolution/uniformity section and a clinical simulation section. The resolution/uniformity section is a cylinder 12.7 cm long and 20 cm in diameter; spatial resolution is evaluated subjectively with 2 sets of rods (hot and cold) of varying diameter (4.0, 5.0, 6.25, 7.81, 9.67, and 12.2 mm) and spacing (twice the rod diameter). The clinical simulation section simulates a transverse section of midbrain with ventricles and gray and white matter compartments. If properly filled, hot rods have a 4:1 target-to-background ratio, and gray–to–white matter sections have a 4:1 ratio. Uniformity and image quality were evaluated using the SUV in a small volume of interest as well as subjectively by 2 independent observers using a 4-point scale. Results: Eleven PBTC sites scanned the phantom on 13 PET scanners. The phantom’s complexity led to suboptimal filling, particularly of the hot rod section, in 5 sites. The SUV in the uniformity section was within 10% of unity on only 5 of 13 scanners, although 12 of 13 were subjectively judged to have very good to excellent uniformity. Four of 6 hot rods were discernable by all 13 scanners, whereas 3 of 6 cold rods were discernable by only 5 scanners. Four of 13 scanners had a gray–to–white matter ratio between 3.0 and 5.0 (4.0 is truth); however, 11 of 13 scanners were subjectively judged to have very good or excellent image quality. Conclusion: Eleven sites were able to image a powerful phantom developed by the SNMMI CTN that evaluated image uniformity, spatial resolution, and image quality of brain PET. There was considerable variation in PET data across the PBTC sites, possibly resulting from variations in scanning across the sites due to challenges in filling the phantom.

Objective: To systematically assess the HRQL outcomes after arthroscopic management of FAI. Date Sources: Three online databases (EMBASE, PubMed, and Ovid [MEDLINE]) were searched for relevant literature from database inception until June 2018 and screened by 2 reviewers independently and in duplicate. Study Selection: Level I to IV English studies that investigated HRQL outcomes after hip arthroscopy were included. Data for generic and hip-specific HRQL outcomes were collected. Mean differences were plotted in a forest plot when possible. Study Design: Systematic review. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Results: A total of 29 studies were included for assessment. Of the 6476 patients (6959 hips), the mean age was 32 years (range 9-79 years) and 50.7% were female. Significant improvements were reported in all studies assessing generic HRQL outcomes, including the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey (range of mean postoperative scores, 82.2-89.8), and EuroQOL-5D scores (range of mean postoperative scores, 0.74-0.87) between 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Significant improvements were similarly identified in the hip-specific HRQL outcomes scores, with the majority of studies also reporting improvement between 12 and 24 months postoperatively. Mean improvement in International Hip Outcome Tool–33 scores from preoperative values to postoperative values ranged from 22.7 to 43.2 (I2 = 44%), for studies with follow-up between 12 and 24 months. Conclusion: Hip arthroscopy can lead to significant improvement in generic and hip-specific HRQL outcomes at 12 to 24 months postoperatively in patients with FAI who do not have advanced hip osteoarthritis. Confirmatory, high-quality, prospective studies are warranted to compare this observed improvement with other treatment modalities for FAI and to determine long-term outcomes. ? 2019 The Author(s).",arthroscopy; FAI; femoroacetabular impingement; hip; quality of life,arthralgia; arthroscopy; femoroacetabular impingement; hip; human; meta analysis; postoperative period; quality of life; Arthralgia; Arthroscopy; Femoracetabular Impingement; Hip Joint; Humans; Postoperative Period; Quality of Life,2-s2.0-85065436743

Epidemiologic data exist on the prevalence of hip and groin issues among players in the National Basketball Association (NBA), but little is known about how these injuries affect athletes after retirement. Hypothesis: A high proportion of retired NBA athletes would have hip and/or groin pain. Study Design: Cross-sectional survey. Level of Evidence: Level 4. Methods: A survey was developed through an interdisciplinary focus group. The survey was developed to capture data regarding demographics, collegiate and professional athletic injuries, and current quality of life and musculoskeletal health. The questionnaire was electronically distributed to all members of the National Basketball Players Association using SurveyMonkey (N = 900). Results: A total of 108 (12%) retired NBA players completed the survey. More than one-third (36.3%) of athletes report currently experiencing hip and/or groin pain, and 17.6% had received injections for hip or groin conditions since retiring from the NBA. Since retiring, 14.7% of respondents had undergone total hip arthroplasty. The median Tegner activity level scale was 3 out of 10. Nearly one-third (32.4%) of athletes report moderate to severe problems with mobility, and close to half (48%) had moderate to extreme pain/discomfort. Conclusion: Hip and groin injuries are common among NBA athletes, affecting players throughout their careers and into retirement.

Primarily cross-sectional and survey-driven, this literature has not yet explored whether these health differences existed before the birth of the CHPs, or are exacerbated postbirth.Methods:Using linked administrative health data on all mother-child dyads for children born in the year 2000 in British Columbia, Canada, we examined maternal health before, during, and after the birth of CHPs, and compared it between mothers of CHPs and non-CHPs with piecewise growth curve modeling.Results:Compared with mothers of non-CHPs, mothers of CHPs had more physician visits (8.09 vs. 11.07), more medication types (1.81 vs. 2.60), and were more likely to be diagnosed with selected health conditions (30.9% vs. 42.5%) 4 years before the birth of the child. Over the 7-year postbirth period, the health of the 2 groups of mothers further diverged: while mothers of CHPs showed increases on physician visits and types of medication, mothers of non-CHPs did not experience any changes in physician visits and had less steep increases for types of medication.Conclusions:Health issues associated with having a child with a health problem may begin well before the birth of the child, but also appear to be exacerbated postbirth. The health challenges of caregivers of CHPs may be multifactorial, involving both preexisting conditions and the stresses associated with caring for a child with health problems. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

This is a cross-sectional study with a community sample of subjects with bipolar disorder, from 23 to 30 years old, with and without childhood trauma. The trauma experiences during childhood were assessed by Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ). The functioning was assessed by Functioning Assessment Short Test (FAST). Ninety subjects with bipolar disorder were included in the study (30 with childhood trauma and 60 without childhood trauma). Young adults with bipolar disorder and childhood trauma showed higher prevalence of current suicide risk, higher severity of depressive symptoms, and higher functioning impairment as compared to subjects with bipolar disorder without childhood trauma.

The outcome measure in CUA is quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), which are calculated using health state utility values (HSUVs) and corresponding life-years. Therefore, HSUVs play a significant role in determining cost-effectiveness. Formal adoption and endorsement of CUAs by reimbursement authorities motivates methodological advancement in HSUV measurement and application. A large body of evidence exploring various methods in measuring HSUVs has accumulated, imposing challenges for investigators in identifying and applying HSUVs to CUAs. First, large variations in HSUVs between studies are often reported, and these may lead to different cost-effectiveness conclusions. Second, issues concerning the quality of studies that generate HSUVs are increasingly highlighted in the literature. This issue is compounded by the limited published guidance and methodological standards for assessing the quality of these studies. Third, reimbursement decision making is a context-specific process. Therefore, while an HSUV study may be of high quality, it is not necessarily appropriate for use in all reimbursement jurisdictions. To address these issues, by promoting a systematic approach to study identification, critical appraisal, and appropriate use, we are developing the Health Utility Book (HUB). The HUB consists of an HSUV registry, a quality assessment tool for health utility studies, and a checklist for interpreting their use in CUAs. We anticipate that the HUB will make a timely and important contribution to the rigorous conduct and proper use of health utility studies for reimbursement decision making. In this way, health care resource allocation informed by HSUVs may reflect the preferences of the public, improve health outcomes of patients, and maintain the efficiency of health care systems. ?

Methods: Following research ethics board approval, all cases of aortoenteric fistula at our institution occurring from 2011–2015 were identified retrospectively. All previous computed tomography images of patients who eventually developed aortoenteric fistula were reviewed by a single observer for the presence of a potentially predictive finding of fistulization, the aortic bulge sign. These previous images were then combined with age and sex matched controls into a case bank. Eight radiology residents and staff were instructed in observing the aortic bulge sign. These observers then reviewed the case bank in a blinded analysis to determine the interobserver reliability of this finding. Results: Fourteen cases of aortoenteric were identified. The average patient age was 70.71 years with a male-to-female ratio of 11:3. Eleven patients had previous computed tomography images available for review. With blinded analysis by multiple observers, the aortic bulge sign was identified with greater than 80% agreement in six of 11 cases (66.67%). Fleiss' kappa was calculated at k = 0.60 (95% confidence interval 0.50–0.69), corresponding to moderate-to-substantial interobserver agreement. Conclusions: The aortic bulge sign has been retrospectively identified as a promising computed tomography finding of eventual aortoenteric fistula prior to acute presentation.

We estimated the proportion of cancers attributed to leisure-time sedentary behavior as a separate risk factor from physical activity in Canada for 2015. We projected numbers of future avoidable cancers by 2042 using various assumed levels of reduced leisure-time sedentary behavior in the population. We calculated population attributable risks (PAR)for associated cancers and all-cancers associated with leisure-time sedentary behavior. Our analysis used pooled data on leisure-time sedentary behavior from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), and incident cancer data from the Canadian Cancer Registry (CCR). Survey respondents were categorized into three levels of leisure-time sedentary behavior, “<3 h/day”, “?3–<6 h/day”, and “?6 h/day”. Estimates for the future burden of leisure-time sedentary behavior were calculated using the potential impact fractions framework (PIF)and counterfactual scenarios, from 10% to 50% decreases in leisure-time sedentary behavior. The estimated prevalence of leisure-time sedentary behavior at the highest level (?6 h/day)in Canada during the 2000s was 9.9% among both sexes combined across age-groups. The total attributable burden due to leisure-time sedentary behavior was estimated to be 10.3% for associated cancers and 6.5% for all-cancers in 2015. A 50% reduction in leisure-time sedentary behavior across the Canadian population could avoid 4054 cancers by 2042. We estimated that over 3000 cancer cases in Canada were attributable to leisure-time sedentary behavior in 2015, and that that 4054 incident cancer cases could be prevented by 2042 with meaningful reductions in leisure-time sedentary behavior. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Cancer risk; Population attributable risk; Potential impact fraction; Prevention; Sedentary behavior,adult; article; attributable risk; Canada; Canadian; cancer registry; cancer risk; controlled study; female; groups by age; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; public health; risk assessment; sedentary lifestyle,2-s2.0-85063066713

The purpose of this analysis was to provide national and provincial estimates of the number and proportion of cancers attributable to alcohol consumption in Canada and to project the numbers of potentially avoidable cancers using possible intervention scenarios. We estimated the population attributable risk (PAR)for cancers associated with alcohol consumption levels (drinks/day)using: i)relative risks obtained from the World Cancer Research Fund/(WCRF)reports or meta-analyses, ii)alcohol consumption (prevalence)data from the 2003 Canadian Community Health Survey, and iii)cancer incidence data from the 2015 Canadian Cancer Registry. We used potential impact fractions (PIFs)to estimate the future avoidable cancer burden under four counterfactual scenarios: (1)lowering alcohol consumption to meet the WCRF low risk guidelines, (2)meeting the Canada's Low-Risk Drinking Guidelines, (3)reducing daily intake by one drink/day, and (4)decreasing consumption to 50% of the 2003 levels by 2032. We estimated that 3282 incident cancer cases (5.2% of alcohol-associated cancers and 1.8% of all cancers)diagnosed in Canada in 2015 were attributable to alcohol consumption. At the current consumption levels, alcohol-attributable cancers are expected to increase to 10,122 (8.8% of cases among alcohol-associated cancers)by 2042. Under the best case scenario, reducing alcohol consumption to 50% of 2003 levels by 2032, could prevent 70,261 cases by 2042.

Objective: To explore the regional variations in the international implementation of the PROBE questionnaire. Methods: Data were collected from participants in four regions (Western Pacific, South America, North America and Europe). Participants were able to choose English or translated versions of the PROBE questionnaire into their first language. We used analysis of variance methods and multivariable regression to determine the relative contribution of the variance explained by region controlling for haemophilia diagnosis, age group and levels of educations. We also explored interactions between region and the other components. Results: We used 862 questionnaires from 14 countries. Mean age of participants was 40.03?years (standard deviation 13.89), and 73.67% were male.

The rate of perioperative clinically significant bleeding was 1.0% (95% CI: 0.1-3.0); re-exploration for bleeding 4.6% (95% CI: 3.1-6.3); postoperative clinically significant bleeding from 30 days until a mean of 7.1 years was 0.5% (95% CI: 0.2-1.0). At a mean of 6.9 years of follow-up, reintervention rate of any operated valve was 7.9% (95% CI: 5.7-10.3). The risk of valve thrombosis was 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.5) at 7.6 years; peripheral embolism 0.3% (95% CI: 0.2-0.4) at 6.4 years; stroke 0.9% (95% CI: 0.7-1.2) at 6.5 years; and endocarditis 2.1% (95% CI: 1.6-2.6) at 8.0 years. Microsimulation reported a 40-year-old undergoing the Ross procedure to have a life expectancy of 35.4 years and event-free life expectancy of 26.6 years. Conclusions: Ross procedure in nonelderly adults is associated with low mortality and low risk of adverse events both at short- and long-term follow-up. The surgical community must prioritize a large, expertize-based randomized controlled trial to definitively address the risks and benefits of the Ross procedure compared to conventional aortic valve replacement. ? 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",surgical history; valve repair/replacement,"age distribution; Article; bicuspid aortic valve; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; endocarditis; event free survival; gender; human; life expectancy; meta analysis (topic); microsimulation; mortality; outcome assessment; perioperative period; prevalence; prosthetic valve thrombosis; risk factor; Ross procedure; simulation; survival rate; systematic review; thrombosis; treatment outcome; valve thrombosis; adolescent; adult; adverse event; age; aortic valve; autograft; bibliographic database; bioprosthesis; computer simulation; follow up; heart valve prosthesis; heart valve replacement; meta analysis; middle aged; procedures; risk; risk assessment; surgery; time factor; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aortic Valve; Autografts; Bioprosthesis; Computer Simulation; Databases, Bibliographic; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Valve Prosthesis; Heart Valve Prosthesis Implantation; Humans; Middle Aged; Risk; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85062954351

In humans, more impulsive DRD is associated with susceptibility to a number of psychiatric diseases (e.g., addiction, ADHD), health outcomes (e.g., obesity), and lifetime outcomes (e.g., educational attainment). Although the determinants of DRD are both genetic and environmental, this review focuses on its genetic basis. Both rodent studies using inbred strains and human twin studies indicate that DRD is moderately heritable, a conclusion that was further supported by a recent human genome-wide association study (GWAS) that used single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to estimate heritability. The GWAS of DRD also identified genetic correlations with psychiatric diagnoses, health outcomes, and measures of cognitive performance. Future research priorities include rodent studies probing putative genetic mechanisms of DRD and human GWASs using larger samples and non-European cohorts. Continuing to characterize genomic influences on DRD has the potential to yield important biological insights with implications for a variety of medically and socially important outcomes. ? 2019",Delayed reward discounting; Genetics; Genomics; Impulsivity,"behavioral response; genetic analysis; genetics; genome; genomics; rodent; temporal variation; delay discounting; genetic correlation; genome-wide association study; heritability; human; nonhuman; psychiatric diagnosis; Review; single nucleotide polymorphism; twin study; addiction; animal; behavioral economics; genomics; impulsiveness; reward; Rodentia; Animals; Behavior, Addictive; Delay Discounting; Economics, Behavioral; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Humans; Impulsive Behavior; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Reward",2-s2.0-85062940496

This study aims to evaluate the accuracy and complications associated with this procedure. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients referred to interventional radiology for pancreatic biopsy at our institution from July 2004-July 2015. Two radiologists independently reviewed the images, technical aspects, and clinical characteristics. Results: A total of 82 patients underwent pancreatic biopsy using a combination of computed tomography (CT) and/or ultrasound guidance. Mean age was 67.8 years with 56% males. Most lesions were located in the head (63.4%), followed by the tail (19.5%), and the body (17.1%). The procedures were performed using the anterior (79.3%), lateral (7.3%), or posterior (13.4%) approach, with direct access in 85.4% of the patients and indirect access (transgastric or transhepatic) in 14.6% of cases. Core biopsies were obtained in 81.7% of cases, and fine needle aspiration was performed in 18.3% of cases. Needle size varied from 18–22 gauge (median 20 gauge). The median number of samples collected was 3 (range 1–8). A conclusive result was obtained in 82.9% of cases. There were 9 (11%) patients with minor complications: minor bleeding, pain, and inadvertent bowel puncture with no clinical repercussion. There were no deaths or major complications. Conclusion: Percutaneous image-guided pancreatic mass biopsy can be performed safely with excellent accuracy. Our results are comparable with endoscopic biopsy/aspiration, and percutaneous biopsy may be used as an alternative, particularly at institutions where endoscopy facilities are limited. ? 2018 Canadian Association of Radiologists",Biopsy; Image-guided; Pancreatic cancer; Percutaneous,"aged; Article; bleeding; cohort analysis; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; enteropathy; female; fine needle aspiration biopsy; human; human tissue; image guided biopsy; image guided percutaneous biopsy; inadvertent bowel puncture; major clinical study; male; pain; pancreas biopsy; pancreas disease; percutaneous biopsy; retrospective study; tertiary care center; diagnostic imaging; image guided biopsy; interventional radiology; interventional ultrasonography; multimodal imaging; pancreas; pancreas tumor; pathology; procedures; reproducibility; x-ray computed tomography; Aged; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Image-Guided Biopsy; Male; Multimodal Imaging; Pancreas; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Radiography, Interventional; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Tertiary Care Centers; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Ultrasonography, Interventional",2-s2.0-85062893517

Methods: A multi-method approach was employed, where initial focus groups (n?=?13) and review of the literature were used to construct a structured survey instrument (n?=?75). Results: Focus group participants made choices about employment with keen awareness of how their bleeding disorder might limit them physically; they described the role of social networks in career choices; and they wrestled with issues of disclosure. Among survey respondents, 47% per cent of respondents reported that haemophilia had a small negative impact, 27% felt that it had a moderate negative impact and 13% indicated that it had a very large negative impact. One-third of respondents had at some point received employment-related advice from a member of their haemophilia treatment centre team. Roughly two-thirds of respondents suggested that vocational advice would be “somewhat” or “very” useful at present.

Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) have demonstrated its safety in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE); however, the evidence is unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the role of EPO in perinatal HIE by a systematic review and meta-analysis. Database search included Embase, MEDLINE, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). RCTs reporting a death, neurodevelopmental outcomes or brain injury were included. Two authors extracted the data independently from included studies and assessed the level of evidence (LOE). Six RCTs (EPO=5 and darbepoetin α=1) involving 454 neonates were included. A trend toward a lower risk of death was identified in infants treated with EPO [EPO with or without hypothermia: five RCTs, 368 participants, relative risk (RR) 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-1.19, LOE-low; EPO without hypothermia: four RCTs, 318 participants, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.49-1.32, LOE-low]. EPO treatment without hypothermia compared to placebo resulted in a reduced risk of cerebral palsy (two RCTs, 230 participants, RR 0.47, 95% CI 0.27-0.80, LOE-moderate) and moderate to severe cognitive impairment (two RCTs, 226 participants, RR 0.49, 95% CI 0.28-0.85, LOE-moderate). A reduced risk of brain injury was identified in EPO treated infants (EPO with or without hypothermia, two RCTs, 148 participants, RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53-0.92, LOE-moderate). EPO administration in neonates with perinatal HIE reduces the risk of brain injury, cerebral palsy and cognitive impairment. The evidence is limited to suggest its role as an adjuvant to hypothermia.

This study aimed to assess the safety of this practice in neonates. Methods: A retrospective chart review of all patients admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)between 2009 and 2015 who underwent a laparotomy with creation of an enterostomy and mucous fistula was performed. Patients were included if they were refed proximal stoma effluent into the MF. Results: Thirty-one patients were identified that were refed. There were no major complications (perforation, stricture, death)related to refeeding. Patients were refed for an average of 41 days (± 22), with patients gaining an average of 25.7 g/day (± 10.1)while being refed. Total parental nutrition (TPN)was administered for an average of 55 days (± 31.4)between resection and reanastomosis, with only 7 (23%)developing cholestasis and 15 (48%)reaching full feeds in this time. Mean time to full feeds after reanastomosis was 36 days (± 58.6)with two patients having anastomotic leaks.

However, the difficulty of using them in people with a particular health condition is that these measures may not encapsulate all of the domains that are impacted by the disease. Objective: To contribute evidence towards the content validity of generic preference-based measures in people with PD. Methods: Participants with PD were interviewed on a personalized measure of quality of life, the Patient Generated Index (PGI). The domains identified with the PGI were then categorized using the WHO's International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health. The extent to which the generic measures (EQ-5D-5L, SF-6D, HUI II, and HUI III) included domains important to persons with PD was qualitatively evaluated. Results: The study included seventy-six participants with PD (mean age 69 years). Dexterity, the top domain nominated by participants, was only included in 1 out of 4 of the generic measures. Fatigue, another commonly reported problem, was not included in 3 out of 4 measures. Sleep, dyskinesia and bowel/bladder problems were not included in any of the measures. Conclusion: Content validity is an essential step in the evaluation of whether a questionnaire truly measures the construct it purports to measure, in this case the construct being health related quality of life (HRQL). This study evaluated the content validity of the EQ-5D-5L, SF-6D, HUI II and HUI III in people with PD, and demonstrated that several important PD specific domains are missing from these measures. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Parkinson disease; Patient reported outcome measures; Quality of life,"generic drug; aged; anxiety; Article; bladder; bladder disease; cognition; content validity; controlled study; depression; dexterity test; drug preference; dyskinesia; employment; enteropathy; European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions questionnaire; fatigue; female; functional status assessment; Health Utilities Index Mark 2; Health Utilities Index Mark 3; Hoehn and Yahr scale; household; human; International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health; interview; intestine; major clinical study; male; Parkinson disease; Patient Generated Index; personality assessment; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quality of life; questionnaire; self care; Short Form 6D; sleep; socialization; speech; work; World Health Organization",2-s2.0-85060341851

Phencyclidine (PCP)—a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist—induces symptoms indistinguishable from those of schizophrenia. A reduction of the phosphoprotein synapsin II has also been implicated in schizophrenia and has a well-known role in the maintenance of the presynaptic reserve pool and vesicle mobilization. This study assessed the behavioral and biochemical outcomes of chronic NMDA receptor antagonism in rodents and its implications for the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Sprague Dawley rats received saline or chronic PCP (5?mg/kg/day) for 14?days via surgically implanted Alzet? osmotic mini-pumps. Following the treatment period, rats were tested with a series of behavioral paradigms, including locomotor activity, social interaction, and sensorimotor gating. Following behavioral assessment, the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) of all rats was isolated for synapsin II protein analysis. Chronic PCP treatment yielded a hyper-locomotive state (p?=?0.0256), reduced social interaction (p?=?0.0005), and reduced pre-pulse inhibition (p?<?0.0001) in comparison to saline-treated controls. Synapsin IIa (p?<?0.0001) and IIb (p?<?0.0071) levels in the mPFC of chronically treated PCP rats were reduced in comparison to the saline group. Study results confirm that rats subject to chronic PCP treatment display behavioral phenotypes similar to established preclinical animal models of schizophrenia. Reduction of synapsin II expression in this context implicates the role of this protein in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and sheds light on the longer-term consequences of NMDA receptor antagonism facilitated by chronic PCP treatment. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",NMDA receptor; phencyclidine; schizophrenia; synapsin II,phencyclidine; synapsin II; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; locomotion; male; medial prefrontal cortex; nonhuman; pathophysiology; prepulse inhibition; priority journal; protein expression; psychosocial withdrawal; rat; schizophrenia; sensory gating; social interaction,2-s2.0-85059645041

There is a lack of information about patterns of referral and treatment for older patients over 70 years of age, in comparison to younger patients with SCLC. Materials and methods: A population-based retrospective cohort study was undertaken for patients identified from the Ontario Cancer Registry, Canada. All cases of SCLC diagnosed between January 2000 and December 2010 were eligible. Data were extracted on demographic variables, treatment and outcome. Logistic regression analyses were performed as appropriate. Results: There were 9021 cases of SCLC, with 10% of cases ?80 years and 32.8% of cases aged 70–79 years and 53% male. Older patients were less likely to be referred to a medical oncologist (OR 0.28 ? 80 years, OR 0.60 70–79 years)and less likely to receive chemotherapy (OR 0.19 ? 80 years, OR 0.52 70–79 years)compared to younger patients (age < 70). Age, higher comorbidity and prior receipt of home care services were all prognostic of a lower likelihood of referral to a medical oncologist and receipt of chemotherapy. Local health region was also prognostic for referral to and receipt of chemotherapy, indicative of significant regional variation in practice. Conclusions: Older patients with SCLC are less likely to be referred for treatment and less likely to receive treatment than younger patients.

We designed an Emergency Radiology Simulator that aimed to assess the breadth of competencies required across Medical and NonMedical Expert domains. Material and Methods: An online simulator with typical emergency cases was administered in October 2015 to Post Graduate Year (PGY)2–5 residents in Radiology. Residents provided preliminary reports, which were graded for style and content. The simulation also included prioritization, protocoling, counseling, and handover exercises geared to assess NonMedical Expert roles. Results: Fourty eight residents participated in the simulation. Level of resident was 11 PGY-2, 17 PGY-3, 13 PGY-4, and 7 PGY-5. There was a significant difference in resident performance between PGY-2 residents and those more senior in terms of the Medical Expert role (findings, diagnosis, recommendations, and clinical relevance of reports). Differences in performance between PGY levels were not seen in the NonMedical Expert roles (prioritization, protocoling, counseling, and handover). Conclusion: Simulation provides an opportunity to assess radiology resident performance across multiple domains. PGY-2 residents performed worse on the Medical Expert domains, although performance did not significantly vary between the other years. This may suggest that competence in Emergency Radiology is achieved early in residency, possibly related to the importance placed on developing skills related to on-call performance during the PGY-2 year. The simulator should be extended to other areas of Radiology, in order to assess the ability to discriminate performance in other subspecialties. ? 2018 The Association of University Radiologists",Competency based education; Emergency radiology; Simulation,Article; cancer diagnosis; clinical assessment; clinical competence; clinical protocol; computer simulation; curriculum; emergency care; emergency patient; emergency ward; exercise; human; image quality; incidental finding; interventional radiology; medical expert; online analysis; patient counseling; priority journal; radiology department; residency education; simulation training; skill; student satisfaction; treatment indication,2-s2.0-85051101049

Previous studies show that PTHrP-induced hypertrophic response in mesangial cells (MCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in tubuloepithelial cells can be mediated by TGF-β1. In the present study, although long-term PHTrP (1–34) treatment increased the mRNA and protein level of TGF-β1 in primary rat MCs, fibronectin up-regulation occurred earlier, suggesting that fibronectin induction is independent of TGF-β1/Smad signaling. We thus evaluated the involvement of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling and found that nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species mediates PTHrP (1–34)-induced Src kinase activation. Src phosphorylates EGFR at tyrosine 845 and then transactive EGFR. Subsequent PI3K activation mediates Akt and ERK1/2 activation. Akt and ERK1/2 discretely lead to excessive protein synthesis of fibronectin. Our study thus demonstrates the new role of PTHrP in fibronectin up-regulation for the first time in glomerular MCs. These data also provided new insights to guide development of therapy for glomerular sclerosis. ? 2019 The Author(s).",,"4 [4 (1,3 benzodioxol 5 yl) 5 (2 pyridinyl) 1h imidazol 2 yl]benzamide; epidermal growth factor receptor; fibronectin; messenger RNA; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; parathyroid hormone related protein; parathyroid hormone[1-34]; protein tyrosine kinase; reactive oxygen metabolite; Smad2 protein; Smad3 protein; transforming growth factor beta receptor; transforming growth factor beta1; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; controlled study; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; gene expression; glomerulosclerosis; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; male; mesangium cell; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; protein expression; protein phosphorylation; protein synthesis; rat; signal transduction; Sprague Dawley rat; transactivation; upregulation",2-s2.0-85065347929

non-vitamin K oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are essential in determining whether evidence from randomised controlled clinical trials translate into meaningful clinical benefits for patients in everyday practice. RIVER (RIVaroxaban Evaluation in Real life setting) is an ongoing international, prospective registry of patients with newly diagnosed non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) and at least one investigator-determined risk factor for stroke who received rivaroxaban as an initial treatment for the prevention of thromboembolic stroke. The aim of this paper is to describe the design of the RIVER registry and baseline characteristics of patients with newly diagnosed NVAF who received rivaroxaban as an initial treatment. Methods and results: Between January 2014 and June 2017, RIVER investigators recruited 5072 patients at 309 centres in 17 countries. The aim was to enroll consecutive patients at sites where rivaroxaban was already routinely prescribed for stroke prevention. Each patient is being followed up prospectively for a minimum of 2-years. The registry will capture data on the rate and nature of all thromboembolic events (stroke / systemic embolism), bleeding complications, all-cause mortality and other major cardiovascular events as they occur. Data quality is assured through a combination of remote electronic monitoring and onsite monitoring (including source data verification in 10% of cases). Patients were mostly enrolled by cardiologists (n = 3776, 74.6%), by internal medicine specialists 14.2% (n = 718) and by primary care/general practice physicians 8.2% (n = 417). The mean (SD) age of the population was 69.5 (11.0) years, 44.3% were women. Mean (SD) CHADS2 score was 1.9 (1.2) and CHA2DS2-VASc scores was 3.2 (1.6). Almost all patients (98.5%) were prescribed with once daily dose of rivaroxaban, most commonly 20 mg (76.5%) and 15 mg (20.0%) as their initial treatment; 17.9% of patients received concomitant antiplatelet therapy. Most patients enrolled in RIVER met the recommended threshold for AC therapy (86.6% for 2012 ESC Guidelines, and 79.8% of patients according to 2016 ESC Guidelines). Conclusions: The RIVER prospective registry will expand our knowledge of how rivaroxaban is prescribed in everyday practice and whether evidence from clinical trials can be translated to the broader cross-section of patients in the real world. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Anticoagulant; Antithrombotic; Atrial fibrillation; Outcomes; Registry; Rivaroxaban,acetylsalicylic acid; purinergic P2Y receptor agonist; rivaroxaban; aged; all cause mortality; Article; atrial fibrillation; bleeding; cardiologist; cerebrovascular accident; CHA2DS2-VASc score; CHADS2 score; disease registry; drug safety; female; follow up; general practitioner; human; internist; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; patient monitoring; practice guideline; prospective study; remote sensing; thromboembolism,2-s2.0-85066403168

Methods: We performed a population-based longitudinal retrospective cohort study to identify hospitalizations and ED visits for RV-AGE and overall AGE in all age groups using ICD-10 codes between August 1, 2005 and March 31, 2016. A negative binomial regression model that included the effect of time was used to calculate rates, rate ratios (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for AGE before and after the program's implementation, after adjusting for age, seasonality and secular trends. We examined the seasonality of RV-AGE hospitalizations among children under five before and after the program and explored its equity impact. Results: Following program implementation, RV-AGE hospitalizations and ED visits among children under five years declined by 76% (RR 0.24, 95% CI 0.20–0.28) and 68% (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.21–0.50), respectively. In addition, hospitalizations and ED visits for overall AGE declined by 38% (RR 0.62, 95% CI 0.59–0.65) and 26% (RR 0.74, 95% CI 0.73–0.76), respectively, among children under age five. Significant reductions in both outcomes were also found across a range of age-strata. In the pre-program period, the mean monthly hospitalization rate for RV-AGE among children residing in the most marginalized neighbourhoods was 33% higher than those residing in the least marginalized (RR 1.33, 95% CI 1.17–1.52), this disparity was not evident in the program period (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.69–1.32). We found no evidence of a seasonal shift in rotavirus pediatric hospitalizations. Interpretation: The introduction of routine infant rotavirus immunization has had a substantial population impact in Ontario. Our study confirms herd effects and suggests the program may have reduced previous inequities in the burden of pediatric rotavirus hospitalizations. ? 2019",Equity; Hospitalization; Immunization; Program impact; Rotavirus; Seasonality,Rotavirus vaccine; acute gastroenteritis; adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; Article; child; child hospitalization; cohort analysis; emergency ward; health care disparity; health care planning; health equity; hospitalization; human; immunization; infant; infantile gastroenteritis; major clinical study; middle aged; nonhuman; observational study; Ontario; population research; preschool child; priority journal; program impact; retrospective study; risk reduction; Rotavirus infection; seasonal variation,2-s2.0-85063751924

Given the lack of published societal guidelines, our goal was to survey radiologists from the American Society of Emergency Radiology membership database to determine consensus on CT protocols for penetrating trauma. Methods: With ethics board approval, an anonymous ten-question online survey was distributed via email to 589 radiologists in the American Society of Emergency Radiology (ASER) member database. The survey was open for a 4-week period in February 2018. A commercially available website that allows subscribers to create and analyze survey results was used for analysis. Results: We received 124 responses (21% response rate) with a majority from U.S. institutions (82%). Seventy-four percent of respondents indicated they do not routinely administer oral contrast in penetrating trauma, 68% do not administer rectal contrast, and 90% do not use commercially available software to assess penetrating injury trajectory. Results from U.S. and non-U.S. practices were comparable. The decision to administer intraluminal contrast is made by the referring physician at 52% of institutions. There is in-house attending level radiology coverage at 54% of institutions and when asked if trauma scans are reviewed before removing the patient from the table, 41% of respondents answered “No.” Conclusion: Enteric contrast is used in a minority of respondents’ centers for penetrating trauma cases, which is likely driven by a perceived lack of added benefit and delays in patient care. ? 2018, American Society of Emergency Radiology.",Bowel injury; Oral contrast; Penetrating trauma; Rectal contrast; Trajectography,"contrast medium; contrast medium; Article; Asia; Australia and New Zealand; Canada; clinical protocol; computer assisted tomography; digestive system injury; Europe; health care survey; human; intraluminal drug administration; penetrating trauma; physician; priority journal; radiologist; research ethics; software; United States; abdominal injury; clinical practice; diagnostic imaging; international cooperation; oral drug administration; penetrating trauma; procedures; questionnaire; rectum; statistics and numerical data; x-ray computed tomography; Abdominal Injuries; Administration, Oral; Contrast Media; Humans; Internationality; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Rectum; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Wounds, Penetrating",2-s2.0-85055711509

To address this challenge, outcomes of second-line protease inhibitor (PI) based ART in Rwanda were assessed. Methods: A two-stage cluster sampling design was undertaken. 49 of 340 health facilities linked to the open-source electronic medical record (EMR) system of Rwanda were randomly sampled. Data sampling criteria included adult HIV positive patients with documented change from first to second-line ART regimen. Retention in care and treatment failure (viral load above 1000 copies/mL) were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazards and logistic regression models. Results: A total of 1688 patients (60% females) initiated second-line ART PI-based regimen by 31st December 2016 with a median follow-up time of 26 months (IQR 24-36). Overall, 92.5% of patients were retained in care; 83% achieved VL ? 1000 copies/ml, 2.8% were lost to care and 2.2% died. Defaulting from care was associated with more recent initiation of ART- PI based regimen, CD4 cell count ?500 cells/mm3 at initiation of second line ART and viral load > 1000 copies/ml at last measurement. Viral failure was associated with younger age, WHO stage III&IV at ART initiation, CD4 cell count ?500 cells/mm3 at switch, atazanavir based second-line ART and receiving care at a health center compared to hospital settings. Conclusions: A high proportion of patients on second-line ART are doing relatively well in Rwanda and retained in care with low viral failure rates. However, enhanced understandings of adherence and adherence interventions for less healthy individuals are required. Routine viral load measurement and tracing of loss to follow-up is fundamental in resource limited settings, especially among less healthy patients. ? 2019 The Author(s).",HIV; Second-line antiretroviral therapy; Treatment failure,abacavir; atazanavir plus ritonavir; lamivudine; lopinavir plus ritonavir; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; tenofovir; zidovudine; anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; atazanavir; adolescent; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; body mass; CD4 lymphocyte count; controlled study; disease classification; female; follow up; health care access; health care facility; health service; human; human cell; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; infection risk; major clinical study; male; medication compliance; middle aged; nonhuman; observational study; outcome assessment; retention in care; retrospective study; Rwanda; treatment failure; treatment outcome; tuberculosis; underweight; virology; virus load; aged; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; treatment failure; virology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Anti-HIV Agents; Atazanavir Sulfate; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Retention in Care; Rwanda; Treatment Failure; Viral Load,2-s2.0-85063905191

The recent explosion of internet searches suggests that mining search databases yields unique information on public interest in mental health disorders, which is a significantly more affordable approach than population health studies. Objective: This study aimed to investigate seasonal patterns of internet mental health queries in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Weekly data on health queries in Ontario from Google Trends were downloaded for a 5-year period (2012-2017) for the terms ""schizophrenia,"" ""autism,"" ""bipolar,"" ""depression,"" ""anxiety,"" ""OCD"" (obsessive-compulsive disorder), and ""suicide."" Control terms were overall search results for the terms ""health"" and ""how."" Time-series analyses using a continuous wavelet transform were performed to isolate seasonal components in the search volume for each term. Results: All mental health queries showed significant seasonal patterns with peak periodicity occurring over the winter months and troughs occurring during summer, except for ""suicide."" The comparison term ""health"" also exhibited seasonal periodicity, while the term ""how"" did not, indicating that general information seeking may not follow a seasonal trend in the way that mental health information seeking does. Conclusions: Seasonal patterns of internet search volume in a wide range of mental health terms were observed, with the exception of ""suicide."" Our study demonstrates that monitoring internet search trends is an affordable, instantaneous, and naturalistic method to sample public interest in large populations and inform health policy planners. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Conventional urine drug testing based on a two-tier immunoassay screen followed by a gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method are expensive and prone to bias while being limited to targeted panels of known drugs of abuse (DoA). Herein, we outline an improved method for drug surveillance that allows for the resolution and detection of an expanded panel of DoA and their metabolites when using multisegment injection-capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (MSI-CE-MS). Multiplexed separations of ten urine samples with a quality control by CE (< 3 min/sample) in conjunction with full-scan data acquisition using a time-of-flight mass spectrometer (TOF-MS) under positive ion mode detection allows for the identification and quantification of DoA above recommended cut-off levels. An excellent resolution of drug isomers and isobars, including background interferences, are achieved when using MSI-CE-MS with an electrokinetic spacer between sample segments, where accurate mass/molecular formula together with the comigration of a matching deuterated internal standard and the detection of one or more bio-transformed metabolites facilitate DoA identification over a wider detection window. Additionally, urine samples can be analyzed directly without enzyme deconjugation for the rapid screening without complicated sample workup. MSI-CE-MS enables the surveillance of a broad spectrum of DoA that is required for the treatment monitoring of high-risk patients, including confirming prescribed drug adherence, revealing illicit drug use/ substitution, and evaluating optimal dosage regimes as required for new advances in precision medicine. ? 2019 Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License.",Capillary electrophoresis; Chemistry; Chronic pain; Clinical depression; Drug metabolites; Drug surveillance; Drug testing; Drugs of abuse; High-throughput screening; Issue 146; Mass spectrometry; Urine,,2-s2.0-85065987522

At baseline, 500 patients were at GAP stage I (nintedanib 304, placebo 196), 489 were at GAP stage II (nintedanib 296, placebo 193) and 71 were at GAP stage III (nintedanib 38, placebo 33). In nintedanibtreated patients, the annual rate of decline in forced vital capacity (FVC) was similar in patients at GAP stage I and GAP stage II/III at baseline (-110.1 and -116.6 mL.year-1, respectively), and in both subgroups was lower than in placebo-treated patients (-218.5 and -227.6 mL.year-1, respectively) (treatment-by-time-by-subgroup interaction p=0.92).

Financial incentives (eg, vouchers or access to health insurance) or disincentives (eg, fines or out-of-pocket costs) affect behaviours. To date, reviews have explored the effects of financial (dis)incentives on patient health and behaviour by focusing on specific behaviours or geographical areas. The objective of this systematic review is to provide a comprehensive overview on the use of financial (dis)incentives as a means of influencing health-related behaviour and costs in randomised trials. Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases, clinical trial registries and websites of health economic organisations for randomised controlled trials. The initial searches, which were conducted on 13 January 2018, will be updated every 12 months until the completion of data analysis. The reference lists of included studies will be manually screened to identify additional eligible studies. Two researchers will independently review titles, abstracts and full texts to determine eligibility according to a set of predetermined inclusion criteria. Data will be extracted from included studies using a form developed and piloted by the research team. Discrepancies will be resolved through discussion with a third reviewer. Risk of bias will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval is not required since this is a review of published data. Results will be disseminated through publication in peer-reviewed journals and presentations at relevant conferences. ? 2019 Author(s).",costs; financial disincentive; financial incentive; health outcomes; health policy; healthcare resource use,article; data analysis; ethics; health behavior; health care policy; human; publication; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; scientist; systematic review,2-s2.0-85065233159

However, many embolic events occur before hospital admission and echocardiography and are thus non-modifiable. We aimed to identify time-sensitive variables that predict embolic events in infective endocarditis, focusing on those that occur after diagnosis. Methods Clinical, microbiological, and echocardiographic characteristics were collected from 116 patients with definite or probable left-sided infective endocarditis admitted to Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre (Toronto, Canada) between October 2013 and July 2016; associations between these characteristics and embolic events were identified using simple logistic regression. Results The mean (SD) age was 66 (17) years; 82 patients (71%) were men. The most frequent microorganisms were Staphylococcus aureus (23%) and viridans group streptococci (21%). Seventy-nine (68%) patients had left-sided vegetations, with involvement of the aortic valve in 34 (43%) patients, mitral valve in 37 (47%) patients, and both in 8 (10%) patients. The mean (SD) vegetation size was 10 (7) mm. Forty-three unique patients (37%) had 50 embolic events, with most (34/43; 79%) having a first embolic event (38/50; 76%) before or on the day of echocardiography. There were no significant predictors of the 11 patients with an embolic event after echocardiography; significant predictors of an embolic event at any time were single valve vegetation vs. no vegetation (OR, 4.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.76–12.78) and, among patients with a vegetation, mitral vs. aortic valve location (OR, 4.43; 95%CI, 1.63–12.04). Conclusions Associations between patient and echocardiographic characteristics and embolism in patients with infective endocarditis may be time-sensitive, as few embolic events occurred after clinical and echocardiographic assessment. ? 2019 Yang et al.

Understanding how primary care is implemented and delivered to transgender individuals is key to improving access and eliminating healthcare barriers. The purpose of this study is to understand how the implementation of primary care services for transgender individuals compares across various models of primary care delivery in Ontario. Methods A qualitative, exploratory, multiple-case study guided by Normalization Process Theory (NPT) was used to compare transgender care delivery and implementation across three primary care models. Three cases known to provide transgender primary care and represent different primary care models in Ontario, Canada (i.e., family health team, community health centre, fee-for service physician) were explored. The NoMAD survey, a tool to measure implementation processes, and qualitative interviews with primary care practitioners and allied healthcare staff were administered. Results Using the NPT framework to guide analysis, key themes emerged about successful implementation of primary care services for transgender individuals. These themes include creating a safe space for patients, identifying gaps in services, understanding practitioners’ roles, and the need for more training and education in transgender care for practitioners. Conclusions Primary care services for transgender individuals can and should be delivered in all models of primary care. Training and awareness for healthcare practitioners are needed to develop capacity in providing primary care to transgender individuals. A greater number of practitioners and organizations are needed to take on this work, embedding and normalizing transgender care into routine practice to address barriers to access and improve quality of care for transgender individuals. ? 2019 Ziegler et al.

The Poverty Action Research Project (PARP) has its origins in the Make Poverty History Committee established by the Assembly of First Nations (AFN) in 2008. Academic members of the Committee in cooperation with the AFN subsequently applied for an action research grant to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). The project selected five volunteer First Nations from different parts of Canada, hiring a coordinator in each, undertaking background research, developing a profile and working with First Nation representatives in the development of a strategy to address upstream determinants of health and well-being. Subsequently, project team members within each region assisted where needed with plan implementation, supporting some initiatives with small grants. This paper provides insights from the project in several key areas, including First Nation rejection of the concept of poverty as usually defined, the importance of taking action to strengthen collectivities as well as individuals, the feasibility of assisting First Nations who are at different points in their development journey, the strengths of the leadership within the First Nations, and finding the appropriate balance between the elected and business leadership. These insights emerged from dialogue and reflection among project team members and community participants over the life of the project. We also describe what we have learned about how to engage effectively and with mutual respect with First Nations in this kind of project. The paper concludes with a review of our experiences with the policies and practices of the national research granting councils and the universities, which have not fully adjusted to the requirements of action research involving First Nations. ?

Design We conducted a meta-synthesis of qualitative studies. Data sources Searches were conducted in Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Criminal Justice Abstracts, Education Resources Information Center, Sociological Abstracts and Cochrane Libraries. Eligibility criteria English-language, primary, qualitative studies that investigated children's or caregivers' perceptions of reporting child maltreatment were included. All healthcare and social service settings implicated by mandatory reporting laws were included. Data extraction and synthesis Critical appraisal of included studies involved a modified checklist from the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP). Two independent reviewers extracted data, including direct quotations from children and caregivers (first-order constructs) and interpretations by study authors (second-order constructs). Third-order constructs (the findings of this meta-synthesis) involved synthesising second-order constructs that addressed strategies to improve the mandatory reporting processes for children or caregivers-especially when these themes addressed concerns raised by children or caregivers in relation to the reporting process. Results Over 7935 citations were retrieved and 35 articles were included in this meta-synthesis. The studies represent the views of 821 caregivers, 50 adults with histories of child maltreatment and 28 children. Findings suggest that children and caregivers fear being reported, as well as the responses to reports. Children and caregivers identified a need for improvement in communication from healthcare providers about mandatory reporting, offering preliminary insight into child-driven and caregiver-driven strategies to mitigate potential harms associated with reporting processes. Conclusion Research on strategies to mitigate potential harms linked to mandatory reporting is urgently needed, as is research that explores children's experiences with this process. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

No review has evaluated all interventional studies for acute musculoskeletal pain, which limits attempts to make inferences regarding the relative effectiveness of treatments. Methods and analysis We will conduct a systematic review of all randomised controlled trials evaluating therapies for acute musculoskeletal pain (excluding low back pain). We will identify eligible, English-language, trials by a systematic search of the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Medline, Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception to February 2018. Eligible trials will: (1) enrol patients presenting with acute, non-low back-related musculoskeletal pain (duration of pain ?4 weeks), and (2) randomise patients to alternative interventions or an intervention and a placebo/sham arm. Fractures will be considered ineligible, unless they are non-surgical and therapy is directed at pain relief. Pairs of reviewers will, independently and in duplicate, screen titles and abstracts of identified citations, review the full texts of potentially eligible trials and extract information from eligible trials. We will use a modified Cochrane instrument to evaluate risk of bias. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion to achieve consensus. We will use the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach to evaluate the quality of evidence supporting treatment effects. When possible, we will conduct: (1) in direct comparisons, a random-effect meta-analysis to establish the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions on patient-important outcomes; and (2) multiple treatment comparison meta-analysis to assess the relative effects of treatments. We will use a priori hypotheses to explain heterogeneity between studies. We will use STATA V.14.2 for all analyses. Ethics and dissemination No research ethics approval is required for this systematic review, as no confidential patient data will be used. The results of this systematic review will be disseminated through publication in a peer-reviewed journal, conference presentations and will inform a clinical practice guideline.

Methods: We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and PsycINFO from the inception of each database through September 2018. We included studies examining patient values and preferences for outcomes related to continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion or artificial pancreas treatment. We compiled structured summaries of the results and assessed the relative importance of each outcome. GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment Development, and Evaluation) and CERQual (Confidence in Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research) approaches provided the structure for the evaluation of the quality of evidence and confidence in the findings. A mixed-methods result-based convergent design provided the structure for integration and presentation of results. Results: We reviewed 1665 unique citations; 19 studies (8 quantitative and 11 qualitative) proved eligible. Glycemic control is the key attribute that drives patients' preference. Reduction of glycemic variability and decreased incidence of hypoglycemia and chronic complications proved of intermediate importance and were ranked similarly to components of treatment burden, including the size and appearance of devices, cost, ease of use, and the embarrassment of public use. Conclusions: Clinician guidance may play a crucial role in determining patient values and preferences (for instance, patients' priority in glucose control rather than avoiding diabetic complications).

Primary treatment typically involves the use of rest, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and physiotherapy. However, in refractory cases where conventional therapy is ineffective, ultrasound-guided injection therapies have become a growing form of treatment. These include needle tenotomy, autologous whole blood injection (AWB), platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection and steroid injection. The consensus regarding the efficacy of individual approaches of ultrasound-guided treatment is unclear in the literature, and is explored further in this review. When evaluating these injection therapies individually, there are multiple case series describing the efficacy of each intervention in refractory lateral epicondylitis. A systematic review of needle tenotomy demonstrates an improvement in pain symptoms for patients with this condition, but all studies were poorly designed with no placebo or control group. Additionally, for PRP therapy, a systematic review performed in 2013 demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pain and functionality for refractory lateral epicondylitis. However, these studies were similarly associated with a high risk of bias. Autologous whole blood injection has been evaluated through well-designed studies to show statistically significant reductions in pain with this intervention. But very few studies in total have been completed using AWB for lateral epicondylitis, and therefore no clear conclusions can be drawn at this time. Finally, corticosteroid use overall is unsupported in the evidence both in the short and long term, especially given that this condition is not an inflammatory pathology. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We used publicly available data from meta-analyses of European BMI genome-wide association studies conducted by the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium and the UK Biobank (UKB) (N = 681,275 adults). A total of 33 loci were identified, of which 19 of 33 (57.6%) were located at SNPs previously identified by the GIANT Consortium and UKB meta-analysis, 11 of 33 (33.3%) were located at novel SNPs, and 3 of 33 (9.1%) were novel genes identified with gene-based analysis. Both single-marker and tagSNP analyses mapped the previously identified 19 SNPs by the GIANT Consortium and UKB meta-analysis. Gene-based analysis confirmed 15 of 19 (78.9%) of the novel SNPs’ associated genes. Of the 11 novel loci, 8 were identified with single-marker analysis and the remaining 3 were identified with tagSNP analysis. Gene-based analysis confirmed 4 of 11 (36.3%) of these loci.

Methods: Phospholamban R14del mutation carriers and family members were identified from inherited arrhythmia clinics at 13?sites across Canada. Cardiac investigations, including electrocardiograms, Holter monitoring (premature ventricular complexes, PVCs), and imaging results were summarised. Results: Fifty patients (10?families) were identified (median age 30?years, range 3–71, 46% female). Mutation carriers were more likely to be older, have low-voltage QRS, T?wave inversion, frequent PVCs, and cardiac dysfunction, compared to unaffected relatives. Increasing age, low-voltage QRS, T?wave inversion, late potentials, and frequent PVCs were predictors of cardiac dysfunction (p?&lt; 0.05 for all). Older carriers (age ?45?years) were more likely to have disease manifestations than were their younger counterparts, with disease onset occurring at an older age in Canadian patients and their Dutch counterparts. Discussion: Among Canadian patients with phospholamban cardiomyopathy, clinical manifestations resembled those of their Dutch counterparts, with increasing age a?major predictor of disease manifestation. Older mutation carriers were more likely to have electrical and structural abnormalities, and may represent variable expressivity, age-dependent penetrance, or genetic heterogeneity among Canadian patients. ? 2019, The Author(s).",Cardiomyopathy; Genetics; Phospholamban; Sudden cardiac death,adenosine triphosphatase (calcium); phospholamban; adult; Article; Canadian; cardiomyopathy; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; deletion mutant; ECG abnormality; echocardiography; female; genetic disorder; genetic regulation; heart disease; heart left ventricle failure; heart ventricle extrasystole; heart ventricle tachycardia; Holter monitoring; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; outcome assessment; QRS complex; QRS interval; retrospective study; senescence; signal averaged electrocardiography; T wave inversion; treadmill exercise,2-s2.0-85063603940

The study objectives were to examine the proportion of people released from provincial correctional facilities who were overdue for colorectal or breast cancer screening on admission to the correctional facility and who were still overdue after 3 years, and to compare findings with data for the general population. Methods: Administrative data were used to identify people eligible for colorectal and breast cancer screening who were released from provincial correctional facilities in 2010 (N=3,803 and N=249, respectively) and in the general population (N=2,757,584 and N=1,099,942, respectively) in Ontario, Canada. Chi-square tests and log binomial regression models were used to compare the proportion of individuals overdue for screening on admission or on July 1, 2010 for the general population, and still overdue after 3 years. Analyses were conducted in 2017 and 2018. Results: Compared with the general population, people in the corrections group were 1.53 times (95% CI=1.50, 1.55) more likely to be overdue for colorectal cancer screening: 77.1% (95% CI=74.3, 79.9) vs 50.5% (95% CI=50.5, 50.6), and 2.25 times (95% CI=2.06, 2.46) more likely to be overdue for breast cancer screening: 65.9% (95% CI=56.2, 76.8) vs 29.3% (95% CI=29.2, 29.4, both p<0.001). They were also more likely to still be overdue 3 years later: 62.6% (95% CI=60.1, 65.2) vs 33.6% (95% CI=33.5, 33.6) for colorectal cancer and 52.2% (95% CI=43.6, 62.0) vs 20.2% (95% CI=20.1, 20.3) for breast cancer (both p<0.001). Conclusions: People who experience imprisonment are less likely than the general population to access colorectal and breast cancer screening. This suggests the need to strengthen primary care for this population. Specifically, efforts should be made to improve access to colorectal and breast cancer screening, through health promotion, program delivery, and linkage to community services while in correctional facilities. ? 2018 American Journal of Preventive Medicine",,adult; age distribution; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer incidence; cancer screening; chi square test; cohort analysis; colorectal cancer; community care; controlled study; female; health care access; health care delivery; health care need; health insurance; health promotion; human; major clinical study; male; mammography; middle aged; occult blood test; patient care; primary medical care; prison; regression analysis; retrospective study,2-s2.0-85062557627

The GFD has significant nutritional limitations which may result in poor diet quality (DQ). We hypothesized that biopsy-proven children with CD (CCD) would have dietary patterns characterized by high saturated fat/simple sugar intake with a low micronutrient density contributing to lower DQ when compared to children with mild-gastrointestinal complaints (GI-CON). In addition, we hypothesized that ethnicity may further impact DQ. Methods: Socio-demographic (age, CD duration, parent/child ethnicity, education), household characteristics, anthropometric, dietary intake (24-h recalls), gastrointestinal pain and adherence was collected in CCD (n = 243) and GI-CON (n = 148). Dietary patterns were determined using k-mean Cluster Analysis. Results: GI-CON had significantly lower DQ than CCD (p < 0.001). Most CCD and GI-CON (>80%) had dietary patterns characterized by1) Western Diet (Cluster 1: %BMR: 110–150, low DQ, high fat, moderate CHO, high sodium) and 2) High Fat-Western Diet (Cluster 2: %BMR:130–150, low DQ, high Fat, high processed meats, high fat dairy products, CHO. Fewer children (<20%) had Prudent, Lower Fat/High Carbohydrate dietary patterns (% BMR:100–150, higher DQ, lower fat/sodium, higher CHO) with a greater proportion of non-Caucasian CCD consuming a Prudent dietary pattern. Seventy-seven percent and 37.5% of CCD and GI-CON, respectively, did not meet estimated average requirements for folate (p < 0.001). Conclusions: CCD and GI-CON have predominantly Western dietary patterns with low DQ, particularly GI-CON. Non-caucasian CCD consume more prudent dietary patterns with higher DQ. Nutrition education is warranted to ensure optimal DQ in children with chronic gastrointestinal diseases. ? 2019 European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism",Celiac disease; Children and youth; Chronic gastrointestinal complaints; Diet patterns; Ethnically diverse,folic acid; protein glutamine gamma glutamyltransferase antibody; riboflavin; selenium; trace element; vitamin D; adolescent; anthropometric parameters; Article; basal metabolic rate; biochemical analysis; body mass; caloric intake; carbohydrate diet; celiac disease; child; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; dietary intake; dietary pattern; fat intake; female; follow up; gastrointestinal pain; gastrointestinal symptom; gluten free diet; glycemic index; glycemic load; Healthy Eating Index Score; histology; histopathology; human; human tissue; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; intestine biopsy; lipid diet; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; nutritional assessment; nutritional parameters; PedsQL Gastrointestinal Symptom Scale; questionnaire; scoring system; self report; sodium intake; sugar intake; Western diet,2-s2.0-85062399531

Most cases of primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR)are low-grade and unlikely to be associated with acquired renal scarring. To select patients at greatest risk, in 2011 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)published guidelines for evaluation of children ages 2 - 24 months with urinary tract infections (UTIs). Similarly, in 2010 the Society for Fetal Urology (SFU)published guidelines for patients with hydronephrosis. Herein a prospectively-collected database was queried through the Institute of Clinical Evaluative Sciences (ICES), exploring trends in VCUG ordering within the Ontario Health Insurance Program (OHIP), which guarantees universal access to care. Material and methods: A dedicated ICES analyst extracted data on all patients younger than 18 years in Ontario, Canada, with billing codes for VCUG and ICD-9 codes for VUR, from 2004-2014. The baseline characteristics included patient age, gender, geographic region, specialty of ordering provider and previous diagnoses of UTI and/or antenatal hydronephrosis to determine the indication for ordering the test. Of these, patients were subsequently incurred OHIP procedure codes for endoscopic injection or ureteral reimplantation. Patients who had a VCUG in the setting of urethral trauma, posterior urethral valves, and neurogenic bladder were excluded. Results and discussion: Trend analysis demonstrated that the total number of VCUGs ordered in the province has decreased over a decade (Figure 1), with a concurrent decrease in VUR diagnosis. On multivariate regression analysis, the decrease in VCUG ordering could not be explained by changes in population demographics or other baseline patient variables. Most VCUGs obtained per year were ordered by pediatricians or family physicians (mean 2,022+523.8), compared with urologists and nephrologists (mean 616+358.3). Interestingly, while the rate of VCUG requests decreased, the annual number of surgeries performed for VUR (endoscopic or open)did not show a significant reduction over time. Conclusions: We present a large population-based analysis in a universal access to care system, reporting a decreasing trend in the number of cystograms and differences by primary care versus specialist providers. While it is reassuring to see practice patterns favorably impacted by guidelines, it is also encouraging to note that the number of surgeries has remained stable. This suggests that patients at risk continue to be detected and offered surgical correction. These data confirm previous institution-based assessments and affirm changes in VCUG ordering independent of variables not relevant to the healthcare system, such as the insurance status. ? 2019 Journal of Pediatric Urology Company",Urinary tract infections; Vesicoureteral reflux; Voiding cystourethrogram,Article; child; cystourethrography; data base; female; health care access; health care system; human; ICD-9; major clinical study; male; population research; practice guideline; preschool child; priority journal; prospective study; trend study; voiding cystourethrogram,2-s2.0-85060844171

It is puzzling why such a condition has not been reduced in frequency, if not eliminated, in the course of evolution. Maternal mortality is a complex phenomenon caused by several physiological and physical factors. Among the physical factors, maternal mortality due to fetopelvic disproportion remains controversial. Several explanations including evolution of bipedal locomotion, rapid brain growth, and nutritional changes and life style changes in settler communities have been proposed. The influences of human reproductive biology and sexual selection have rarely been considered to explain why maternal mortality persisted through human evolution. We entertain the hypothesis that irrespective of the causes, the risks of all factors causing maternal mortality would be aggravated by disassortative mating, specifically male preference for younger females who are generally small statured and at higher risk of obstetric complications. Maternal mortality arising due to sexual selection and mate choice would have the long-term effect of driving widowers toward younger women, often resulting in “child marriage,” which still remains a significant cause of maternal mortality globally. Evolutionarily, such a male driven mating system in polygamous human populations would have prolonged the persistence of maternal mortality despite selection acting against it. The effects may extend beyond maternal mortality because male-mate choice driven maternal mortality would reduce average reproductive life spans of women, thus influencing the evolution of menopause. ?

Methods: Using US MarketScan claims from November 2012 to March 2017, we identified adults with ?1 primary hospitalization or emergency department diagnosis code for venous thromboembolism, a provoking (major or minor, persistent or transient) risk factor, at least 3 months of continuous rivaroxaban treatment, and ?12 months of continuous insurance benefits prior to their qualifying venous thromboembolism. Patients were categorized as either continuing rivaroxaban or discontinuing anticoagulation (no anticoagulation or nonaspirin antiplatelet agents but may have received aspirin) after the initial 3 months of rivaroxaban treatment (index date). Differences in baseline covariates between cohorts were adjusted for using inverse probability-of-treatment weights based on propensity scores (absolute standardized differences <0.1 achieved for all covariates after adjustment). Twelve month incidences of recurrent venous thromboembolism or major bleeding were compared between cohorts using Cox regression (according to an intention-to-treat methodology) and reported as hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Among patients experiencing a provoked venous thromboembolism and treated with rivaroxaban for the first 3 months (N=4,990), continued rivaroxaban use beyond 3 months (median [25%, 75% range duration of additional rivaroxaban use = 3 [2, 5] months) was associated with a 44% (95% CI of 9%-66%) lower hazard of recurrent venous thromboembolism without altering major bleeding risk [HR of 0.87, 95% CI of 0.51-1.49] versus anticoagulation discontinuation (with or without aspirin use). Conclusions: Our study suggests continuing rivaroxaban after the initial 3 month period was associated with a decreased risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism. The observed reduction in recurrent venous thromboembolism with prolonged rivaroxaban use was not associated with a significant change in major bleeding risk. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Anticoagulants; Extended duration; Provoked; Rivaroxaban; Venous thromboembolism,acetylsalicylic acid; angiotensin receptor antagonist; antidepressant agent; antidiabetic agent; antithrombocytic agent; antiulcer agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; calcium channel blocking agent; digoxin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; diuretic agent; estrogen derivative; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; insulin; rivaroxaban; blood clotting factor 10a inhibitor; rivaroxaban; adult; aged; anticoagulant therapy; Article; chronic drug administration; cohort analysis; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; drug efficacy; drug safety; emergency ward; female; health insurance; hospitalization; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; incidence; major clinical study; male; patient coding; priority journal; probability; propensity score; recurrent disease; retrospective study; risk factor; standardization; venous thromboembolism; middle aged; recurrent disease; secondary prevention; venous thromboembolism; Aged; Factor Xa Inhibitors; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Recurrence; Retrospective Studies; Rivaroxaban; Secondary Prevention; Venous Thromboembolism,2-s2.0-85059937750

It explores a number of dimensions of recovery including clinical, existential, functional, physical, and social. The women described engaging in “survival” recovery in the short term and “thriving” recovery in the long term, with survival strategies extending into the thriving phase of recovery during their complex path to it. The survival recovery phase included accessing culturally sensitive mental health care and obtaining social and instrumental support to help ensure safety, manage stress, and treat psychiatric symptoms. The thriving phase of recovery was described as involving six components: developing an explanatory model with their health care provider; undertaking a process of narrative reflection and prioritizing self-care; engaging in interdisciplinary care team support; engaging the support of family and friends; exploring spiritual and existential supports; and creating goals for the future and a sense of mastery. Through these six avenues, the women began to experience a sense of self-efficacy and agency that improved their ability to cope with stress and pressure, leading to building a life with meaning.

Introduction: The Patient-Rated Elbow Evaluation (PREE) and the self-report section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons—elbow form (pASES-e) are 2 patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) commonly used to assess pain and disability arising from elbow disorders. Purpose of the Study: To systematically review and summarize the quality and content of the evidence that is available on the psychometric properties of the PREE and pASES-e. Methods: We systematically searched the online databases PubMed, EMBASE, ProQuest, Scopus, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, UptoDate, ProQuest Dissertations & Theses, and Google Scholar. Ninety-one articles were retrieved, and after screening, 9 were included in the final analysis. Data extraction and quality appraisal was performed by 2 independent raters. Descriptive synthesis of the reviewed studies was completed. Results: Seven of the 9 studies had a quality score of 75% or higher. Agreement between the raters was good (kappa, 0.81). Both the PROMs did not demonstrate any floor and ceiling effects except for the satisfaction subscale of the pASES-e. Factor analysis revealed multidimensionality in the function subscale for both the PROMs. Construct validity was good with correlations above 0.70. Both were highly reliable with interclass correlation coefficient of >0.90. They were also highly responsive with an effect size and standardized response mean above 1. The minimal clinical important difference was not estimated for either measures. Discussion: This study concluded that strong clinical measurement properties exist for both the PREE and the pASES-e. We identified gaps in the current evidence for both the ASES-e and the PREE. Future studies need to calculate clinically important estimates like MCID, SEM, and others; and provide clear and specific conclusions. Conclusion: The PREE and pASES-e have been established to be valid, reliable, and sensitive to change in both clinical and research settings based on high-quality evidence. ? 2018 Hanley & Belfus",Clinical measurement properties; pASES-e; PREE; Systematic review,area under the curve; arm pain; Article; construct validity; disability; elbow; human; internal consistency; joint function; measurement error; minimum detectable change; patient-reported outcome; psychometry; quality assessment tool; systematic review; test retest reliability; arthralgia; elbow; pain measurement; pathophysiology; psychometry; self report; Arthralgia; Disability Evaluation; Elbow Joint; Humans; Pain Measurement; Patient Reported Outcome Measures; Psychometrics; Self Report,2-s2.0-85058847997

On last ultrasound examination, thrombus resolution was documented in treated (ACT; n?=?19) and nontreated (n?=?55) neonates: 12 (63%) versus 32 (58%) with complete resolution, 1 (5%) versus 6 (11%) partial, 0 versus 1 (2%) extension, and 6 (32%) versus 16 (29%) had nonprogressive lesions, respectively. Seventy-one (96%) had no complications. Seventy-one articles met inclusion criteria for the systematic review and 19 were retained for analysis after assessment. Conclusions: PVT resolution rate was similar to previous reports. Although a low complication rate was detected, longer follow-up is necessary to determine the need for early treatment and the precise incidence of outcomes such as portal hypertension. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",clinical characteristics; neonate; outcomes; portal vein; thrombosis,"low molecular weight heparin; anticoagulant therapy; Article; catheter thrombosis; child; clinical outcome; controlled study; descriptive research; echography; female; hepatic portal vein; human; infant; major clinical study; male; meta analysis; newborn; newborn disease; portal vein thrombosis; prematurity; priority journal; retrospective study; systematic review; tertiary care center; thrombocytopenia; diagnostic imaging; newborn disease; thrombosis; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Newborn, Diseases; Male; Portal Vein; Retrospective Studies; Thrombosis",2-s2.0-85057950552

Few studies, however, have investigated how the media portrays climate change impacts on human health. This review, therefore, presents a quantitative spatiotemporal analysis of Canadian newspaper coverage of climate change impacts on health between 2005 and 2015. Using the ProQuest? and Eureka? databases, a multiphase systematic review strategy was employed to identify relevant English and French articles from two national and six regional high-circulation newspapers. Quantitative and qualitative data were extracted from 145 articles and analyzed to characterize the range, extent, and nature of climate-health newspaper coverage in Canada and to compare these characteristics by region and over time. Coverage varied by region, with the highest proportion of climate-health coverage in Northern Territories (Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut). Over time, there was a decreasing publication frequency trend. Almost all articles described negative climate change impacts on health, with a predominant focus on infectious and chronic noninfectious diseases; however, less than half of the articles discussed climate change solutions. These trends suggest that current media coverage might not drive widespread public support for policies and actions needed to protect against projected climate-health risks. Consequently, as climate change continues to challenge human health, increasing media emphasis on climate change impacts on human health, as well as a shift toward enabling and empowering climate change communication, in which viable mitigation and adaptation options are emphasized, could help to spur action to reduce climate change health risks. ? 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,Digital storage; Health; Health risks; Newsprint; Public risks; Climate change impact; Media coverage; Newspaper review; Northern territories; Public support; Qualitative data; Spatiotemporal analysis; Systematic Review; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; health impact; literature review; media role; public health; trend analysis; Canada; Nunavut; Yukon Territory,2-s2.0-85060340452

In these patients, the use of chest imaging modalities may serve as an initial screening tool towards the diagnosis of sarcoidosis through identification of pulmonary/mediastinal involvement; however, the use of chest imaging for this purpose has not been well studied. We assessed the utility of different chest imaging modalities for initial screening for cardiac sarcoidosis (CS). Methods and Results: All patients were investigated with chest x-ray, chest computed tomography (CT) and/or cardiac/thorax magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We then used the final diagnosis (CS versus no CS) and adjudicated imaging reports (normal versus abnormal) to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of individual and combinations of chest imaging modalities. We identified 44 patients (mean age 54 (±8) years, 35.4% female) and a diagnosis of CS was made in 18/44 patients (41%). The sensitivity and specificity for screening for sarcoidosis were 35% and 85% for chest x-ray, respectively (AUC 0.60; 95%CI 0.42-0.78; p value=0.27); 94% and 86% for chest CT (AUC 0.90; 95%CI 0.80-1.00; p value <0.001); 100% and 50% for cardiac/thorax MRI (AUC 0.75; 95%CI 0.56-0.94; p value=0.04). Conclusions: During the initial diagnostic workup of patients with suspected CS, chest x-ray was suboptimal as a screening test. In contrast CT chest and cardiac/thorax MRI had excellent sensitivity. Chest CT has the highest specificity among imaging modalities. Cardiac/thorax MRI or chest CT could be used as an initial screening test, depending on local availability. ?

This systematic review and meta-analysis seeks to determine the effectiveness of MBIs for mental health outcomes in post-secondary students. We searched OVID MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE, CENTRAL, CINAHL, PsychInfo, World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, ClinicalTrials.gov, Google Scholar, Proquest Dissertations, and OpenGrey. When possible, data were pooled using a random-effects model. Effect estimates were reported as standardized mean differences (SMDs) and then back-transformed into common scales of measurement. This review includes 41 randomized controlled trials reported in 49 studies. When comparing to a passive control, MBIs appear to reduce symptoms of depression [SMD ? 0.49 (95% CI ? 0.68, ? 0.30)], anxiety [SMD ? 0.53 (95% CI ? 0.78, ? 0.29)], and perceived stress [SMD -0.39 (95% CI -0.50, -0.27)] post-intervention (low-quality evidence). These findings were similar for shorter compared to longer interventions, although mindfulness-based cognitive therapy appeared to be the most effective for depression and anxiety. This review found no differential effects of MBIs compared to active comparators for depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, or perceived stress (low-quality evidence). Overall, MBIs of at least 2?weeks in duration appear to be a better alternative than no intervention for students with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Mental health; Meta-analysis; Mindfulness; Post-secondary; Students; Systematic review,,2-s2.0-85062476184

Current treatment strategies for COPD are multi-modal and aim to reduce morbidity and mortality and increase patients’ quality of life by slowing disease progression and preventing exacerbations. Fixed-dose combinations (FDCs) of a long-acting beta 2 -agonist (LABA) plus a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) delivered via a single inhaler are approved by regulatory authorities in the USA, Europe, and Japan for the treatment of COPD. Several LABA/LAMA FDCs are available and recent meta-analyses have clarified their utility versus their mono-components in COPD. Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of once-daily LABA/LAMA FDCs versus placebo will facilitate the comparison of different FDCs in future network meta-analyses. Objectives We assessed the evidence for once-daily LABA/LAMA combinations (delivered in a single inhaler) versus placebo on clinically meaningful outcomes in patients with stable COPD. Search methods We identified trials from Cochrane Airways’ Specialised Register (CASR) and also conducted a search of the US National Institutes of Health Ongoing Trials Register ClinicalTrials.gov (www.clinicaltrials.gov) and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (apps.who.int/trialsearch). We searched CASR and trial registries from their inception to 3 December 2018; we imposed no restriction on language of publication. Selection criteria We included parallel-group and cross-over randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing once-daily LABA/LAMA FDC versus placebo. We included studies reported as full-text, those published as abstract only, and unpublished data. We excluded very short-term trials with a duration of less than 3 weeks. We included adults (? 40 years old) with a diagnosis of stable COPD. We included studies that allowed participants to continue using their ICS during the trial as long as the ICS was not part of the randomised treatment. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently screened the search results to determine included studies, extracted data on prespecified outcomes of interest, and assessed the risk of bias of included studies; we resolved disagreements by discussion with a third review author. Where possible, we used a random-effects model to meta-analyse extracted data. We rated all outcomes using the GRADE (Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation) system and presented results in’Summary of findings’ tables. Main results We identified and included 22 RCTs randomly assigning 8641 people with COPD to either once-daily LABA/LAMA FDC (6252 participants) or placebo (3819 participants); nine studies had a cross-over design. Studies had a duration of between three and 52 weeks (median 12 weeks). The mean age of participants across the included studies ranged from 59 to 65 years and in 21 of 22 studies, participants had GOLD stage II or III COPD. Concomitant inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) use was permitted in all of the included studies (where stated); across the included studies, between 28% to 58% of participants were using ICS at baseline. Six studies evaluated the once-daily combination of IND/GLY (110/50 ?g), seven studies evaluated TIO/OLO (2.5/5 or 5/5 ?g), eight studies evaluated UMEC/VI (62.5/5, 125/25 or 500/25 ?g) and one study evaluated ACD/FOR (200/6, 200/12 or 200/18 ?g); all LABA/LAMA combinations were compared with placebo. The risk of bias was generally considered to be low or unknown (insufficient detail provided), with only one study per domain considered to have a high risk of bias except for the domain’other bias’ which was determined to be at high risk of bias in four studies (in three studies, disease severity was greater at baseline in participants receiving LABA/LAMA compared with participants receiving placebo, which would be expected to shift the treatment effect in favour of placebo). Compared to the placebo, the pooled results for the primary outcomes for the once-daily LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: all-cause mortality, OR 1.88 (95% CI 0.81 to 4.36, low-certainty evidence); all-cause serious adverse events (SAEs), OR 1.06 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.28, high-certainty evidence); acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), OR 0.53 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.78, moderate-certainty evidence); adjusted St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) score, MD -4.08 (95% CI -4.80 to -3.36, high-certainty evidence); proportion of SGRQ responders, OR 1.75 (95% CI 1.54 to 1.99). Compared with placebo, the pooled results for the secondary outcomes for the once-daily LABA/LAMA arm were as follows: adjusted trough forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), MD 0.20 L (95% CI 0.19 to 0.21, moderate-certainty evidence); adjusted peak FEV1, MD 0.31 L (95% CI 0.29 to 0.32, moderate-certainty evidence); and all-cause AEs, OR 0.95 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.04; high-certainty evidence). No studies reported data for the 6-minute walk test. The results were generally consistent across subgroups for different LABA/LAMA combinations and doses. Authors’ conclusions Compared with placebo, once-daily LABA/LAMA (either IND/GLY, UMEC/VI or TIO/OLO) via a combination inhaler is associated with a clinically significant improvement in lung function and health-related quality of life in patients with mild-to-moderate COPD; UMEC/VI appears to reduce the rate of exacerbations in this population. These conclusions are supported by moderate or high certainty evidence based on studies with an observation period of up to one year. Copyright ? 2019 The Cochrane Collaboration.

In adults, cardiovascular disease is one of the leading causes of mortality in First Nations communities, and diabetes is a significant contributor to the risk of developing this disorder. The early onset of diabetes may predispose these children to premature cardiovascular disease and influence their longevity and quality of life. As a result, the implementation of culturally tailored obesity and T2DM primary prevention programs is vital. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of existing traditional knowledge-based lifestyle intervention programs on preventing obesity and T2DM in Indigenous children in Canada. Methods: We will conduct database searches in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and the Cochrane Controlled Register of Trials. We will also conduct grey literature searches of central repository of trials (ClinicalTrials.gov), ProQuest Dissertations, Theses A&I, and Indigenous studies portal research tools. Reviewers will independently review titles, abstracts, and full-text articles retrieved from databases to assess potentially eligible studies, and relevant articles will be assessed for risk of bias and quality. The primary outcomes include the change in body mass index z-scores or a diagnosis of diabetes. The secondary outcomes include the change in measures of adiposity as well as lifestyle and metabolic profiles. A meta-analysis will be performed if two or more studies have used similar study designs, comparable intervention techniques, similar populations and measured similar outcomes. Discussion: This review will provide a summary of current interventions to prevent obesity and T2DM in Indigenous children in Canada and help determine the gaps in the literature so that interventions can be developed to control the surge in pediatric T2DM in Indigenous communities.

With the introduction of antiretroviral drugs, people living with HIV (PLHIV) have a much better prognosis, even though there are still many new infections in young women. The role of widespread antiretroviral therapy (ART) on the incidence of HIV in young women is unknown. Methods: We will conduct a comprehensive search of MEDLINE (PubMed), Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Scopus, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), World Health Organization's (WHO's) library database, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACS), conference abstracts, and gray literature sources to identify any relevant literature. We will include randomized and non-randomized clinical trials and cohort studies in which ART was offered to adults aged 18 and above reporting outcomes in females aged 15 to 24 years. The outcomes of interest are HIV incidence, ART initiation, adherence, retention, and viral load suppression. We will screen titles, abstracts, and the full texts of relevant articles in duplicate. Disagreements will be resolved by consensus. We will extract data on the risk of HIV infection in younger females after the use of ART in the adult population. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to look at the impact of ART use among adults on HIV incidence in young women. The results of this review will be used in a modeling study to simulate the effects of using ART as an effective tool to prevent sexual transmission of HIV to young women. Our findings will inform the treatment-as-prevention (TasP) strategy to reduce new HIV infections among young women.

Objective: To determine common definitions and patient risk factors for unplanned dialysis. Design: Systematic review. Setting: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from inception to February 2018. Patients: Studies that included incident chronic dialysis patients or patients with CKD that cited a definition or examined risk factors for unplanned dialysis were included. Measurements: Definitions and criteria for unplanned dialysis reported across studies. Patient characteristics associated with unplanned dialysis. Methods: Two reviewers independently extracted data using a standardized data abstraction form and assessed study quality using a modified New Castle Ottawa Scale. Results: From 2797 citations, 48 met eligibility criteria. Reported definitions for unplanned dialysis were variable. Most publications cited dialysis initiation under emergency conditions and/or with a central venous catheter. The association of patient characteristics with unplanned dialysis was reported in 26 studies, 18 were retrospective and 21 included incident dialysis patients. The most common risk factors in univariate analyses were (number of studies) increased age (n = 7), cause of kidney disease (n = 6), presence of cardiovascular disease (n = 7), lower serum hemoglobin (n = 9), lower serum albumin (n = 10), higher serum phosphate (n = 6), higher serum creatinine or lower estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at dialysis initiation (n = 7), late referral (n = 5), lack of dialysis education (n = 6), and lack of follow-up in a predialysis clinic prior to dialysis initiation (n = 5). A minority of studies performed multivariable analyses (n = 10); the most common risk factors were increased age (n = 4), increased comorbidity score (n = 3), late referral (n = 5), and lower eGFR at dialysis initiation (n = 3). Limitations: Comparison of results across studies was limited by inconsistent definitions for unplanned dialysis. High-quality data on patient risk factors for unplanned dialysis are lacking. Conclusions: Well-designed prospective studies to determine modifiable risk factors are needed. The lack of a consensus definition for unplanned dialysis makes research and quality improvement initiatives in this area more challenging. ?

Objective The purpose of this systematic review was to: (1) determine the degree of correlation between the CSA and shoulder pathologies, (2) determine the reliability of measuring CSA between (inter-rater reliability) and within (intrarater reliability) clinicians, (3) assess the accuracy of different imaging modalities used for measuring the CSA and (4) determine the association of CSA with patient outcomes after surgery. Evidence review The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were searched in March 2018 for relevant studies. The results are presented in a narrative summary. Findings A total of 26 studies and 4563 patients satisfied the inclusion criteria. The majority of CSAs were measured using radiographs (98.2%) in neutral rotation (72.9%). Significant associations (p<0.05) were found between lower CSAs (<30°) and osteoarthritis, and higher CSAs (>35°) with primary rotator cuff tears and the risk of re-tear following a repair. The CSA has excellent intrarater (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.903 to 0.996) and inter-rater reliability (ICC 0.869 to 0.980) when measured with radiographs. High variability in measurements was found when using MRI. The CSA, however, is not a clear, significant independent predictor (p>0.05) of outcomes after the surgical management of shoulder pathologies. Conclusions and relevance The CSA is an effective radiographic parameter that is associated with rotator cuff tears and osteoarthritis. Lower CSAs (<30°) are associated with osteoarthritis, whereas higher CSAs (>35°) are associated with primary rotator cuff tears and re-tear after arthroscopic repair. Currently, there is a limited predictive value of the CSA in patient-reported outcomes after rotator cuff repair. The CSA is measured with high intrarater and inter-rater reliability for both radiographs and CT scans. Measuring the CSA using radiographs with the arm in the neutral rotation is currently recommended. Future studies are required to further investigate how best use the CSA to guide patient management and its predictive value. Level of evidence IV. ?

To summarize the literature on improving opportunities for physical activity for residents in long-term care (LTC). Method. Narrative review of the literature. Results. Residents in LTC spend much of their time in sedentary activities such as sitting or lying in bed. Physical activity is important to help decrease the negative effects of sedentary time, such as poor mood and increased risk of death, and to improve physical function. This review identifies several strategies for promoting physical activity for LTC residents: incorporating simple strategies into daily activities, participating in group activities (eg, exercise, dance, or music therapy), using motivational strategies to encourage staff to promote activity, leveraging the physical environment, reducing physical and chemical restraints, and using innovative solutions such as robots or interactive technology. Conclusion. While the quality of evidence to date is limited, preliminary work suggests that the strategies identified in this article could be included as part of a multifactorial approach to increasing physical activity in LTC. ? 2019 Turner White Communications Inc..

Objective: To investigate the association between regular aspirin use and lethal PC. Design, setting, and participants: Participants were aged 40–75 yr at baseline in 1986 and have been followed with biennial questionnaires. The risk analysis includes 49 409 men. The survival analysis includes 5980 PC patients without metastatic disease at diagnosis. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: We used Cox proportional hazards regression to examine the association between current, past, or never regular aspirin use (?2 d/wk) in relation to lethal (metastatic or fatal) PC. We also examined years of use among current users and years since stopping among past users. In the risk analysis, aspirin was updated throughout follow-up. In the survival analysis, aspirin use after diagnosis was assessed. Results and limitations: Some 29% of participants used aspirin regularly at baseline, which increased to 60% by 2010. In the risk analysis, 804 men were diagnosed with lethal PC. Current regular aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal prostate cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.66–0.96) compared to never users. In the survival analysis, 451 of the men diagnosed with nonmetastatic PC later developed lethal disease. Current postdiagnostic aspirin was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.64–1.00) and overall mortality (HR 0.79, 95% CI 0.69–0.90). When restricted to highly screened men, the risk analysis associations were stronger and survival analysis associations remained statistically significant. Reverse causation and residual confounding remain concerns, as demonstrated by the attenuated results in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: Regular aspirin use was associated with a lower risk of lethal PC. Postdiagnostic use was associated with better survival after diagnosis. Patient summary: We found that it may be advisable for prostate cancer patients to take aspirin to improve their survival for both prostate cancer mortality and other mortality outcomes. It is advisable for older adults without a contraindication to take aspirin for many established health benefits. We show that there may be further disease-specific benefits among men with prostate cancer. However, a randomized trial is needed to confirm or refute this association. ? 2018 European Association of Urology",Aspirin; Lethal prostate cancer; Prostate cancer survival,acetylsalicylic acid; adult; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; proportional hazards model; prospective study; prostate cancer; questionnaire; risk assessment; survival analysis,2-s2.0-85065288832

The purpose of this review was to identify and describe the epidemiology and available treatment options for the most well-known vascular compromised closed fractures. The injuries discussed in detail in this review were scaphoid, lunate, femoral neck, and talar fractures. Current evidence suggests that optimal treatment for vascular compromised fractures is dependent on the degree of fracture displacement and comminution, and the patient’s post-injury functional demands, age, and bone quality. Conservative efforts generally include casting or splinting with a period of immobilization. Surgery is indicated for substantially displaced fractures, patients who require higher functional demands and an earlier return to activity, or if complications occur following nonoperative treatment; however, operative intervention is typically performed for femoral neck fractures regardless of the amount of displacement. Various surgical techniques exist, though internal fixation with screws is a common procedure among these injuries and can be used in combination with other implants, such as plating or Kirschner wires (k-wires), when needed. Severe fracture comminution, poor bone quality, or arthritis can contraindicate the use of screws and more invasive intervention will be required. Bone grafting is done in some cases to enhance vascularity. Salvage procedures exist for patients who develop severe complications, but these will permanently alter the anatomy of the injured area and should be considered a last resort. ?

It can be hypothesized that smoking during pregnancy and low maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) would lead to a higher proportion of growth restricted male compared to female newborns. The objective of the study was to analyze sex-specific differences in birth weight related to smoking and maternal BMI. Method: Data on maternal and newborn characteristics were obtained from the German Perinatal Survey. We analyzed data on 508,926 singleton pregnancies that had been collected in eight German federal states between 1998 and 2000. Women were classified according to the number of cigarettes smoked per day (non-smokers, 1–7, 8–14, ? 15) and by maternal BMI (&lt; 18.5, 18.5–24.99, 25–29.99, ? 30 kg/m?) at the first obstetric consultation.

The proportional sexual dimorphism (PSD) was calculated as the female mean divided by the male mean ×100. Results: Smoking is related to a decrease in mean birth weight and an increase of in the SGA rate. Maternal BMI is positively related to the birth weight. However, the proportional sexual dimorphism for birth weight was not different with smoking or BMI. Conclusion: Smoking during pregnancy is related to lower birth weight, and high BMI is related to higher birth weight with no change in PSD. ? 2018 E.

To determine barriers and facilitators to the uptake of findings from the Research in Arthritis in Canadian Children emphasizing Outcomes (ReACCh-Out) study into clinical care by pediatric rheumatologists (PR) and allied health professionals (AHP) caring for children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in Canada. Methods. PR and AHP participated in this qualitative study through telephone interviews. Interview guides were developed using the Theoretical Domains Framework and focused on the use of information from the ReACCh-Out study in the practice of counseling patients and families. A directed content analysis approach was used for coding. Results. Nineteen interviews (8 PR and 11 AHP) were completed. All PR had knowledge of the ReACCh-Out study. Three major themes were identified: (1) both groups are motivated to use information from research in clinical care; (2) volume and emotional effect of information on families are barriers; and (3) specific timepoints in care trigger providing this information. AHP had less knowledge of the ReACCh-Out study, did not feel it was their primary role to provide this information, and have a desire for more opportunity to participate in academic forums related to research. Conclusion. We have described a comprehensive overview of the barriers and facilitators perceived by healthcare providers in the translation of knowledge from JIA research into use in clinical practice.

The specific methodology used to develop a PROM should be communicated to establish the quality of the instrument. This mixed methods protocol describes the development of a cross-cultural, internationally applicable PROM for hand conditions, the HAND-Q. Methods and analysis The multiphase approach used for this study has been previously used with the development of other PROMs by our team (eg, BODY-Q, BREAST-Q, CLEFT-Q, FACE-Q). In Phase I, we establish what important concepts matter to patients with hand conditions. A conceptual framework is developed from a systematic review of existing PROMs in the field and an extensive international qualitative study. Interpretive description is the qualitative approach used. Item generation is based on the qualitative data. The preliminary scales will be created for each theme identified in the conceptual framework. These scales will be refined by cognitive debriefing interviews with participants and expert input. Phase II involves a large international sample of patients with varied hand conditions completing the field-test version of the HAND-Q. The scales will be refined using the modern psychometric approach of Rasch Measurement Theory. Analysis will result in a shortened set of clinically meaningful and scientifically robust HAND-Q scales.

A constructivist grounded theory approach was used. Transcripts were coded into thematic coding trees.Results The twelve participants did not value the HEWS in the ED because they felt it was not helpful in identifying critically ill patients. We identified five themes; knowledge of sepsis and HEWS, utility of HEWS in emergency triage, utility of HEWS at the bedside, utility in communicating acuity and deterioration, and feasibility and accuracy of data collection. We also found 9 barriers and 7 enablers to the use of early warning score in the ED.Conclusions In our emergency departments, we identified potential barriers to implementation of an early warning score.

We aimed to describe surgeons' practices and perceptions of this procedure. Methods and results We built a self-administered survey in collaboration with content and methodology experts. We surveyed 268 cardiac surgeons from 80 centres in 18 countries. The response rate was 76% (n = 204/276), 49% from North America, 39% Europe, and 12% other regions. Respondents performed a median 10 [interquartile range (IQR) 4-30] AF ablation procedures/year, with marked variation in proportions of patients with AF considered for ablation (median 25%, IQR 10-61). 94% and 80% of surgeons respectively, thought symptomatic and asymptomatic patients benefit from ablation. Surgeons estimated the added major complication rate of concomitant AF ablation at 16% [median (IQR) 7-25]. Of participating surgeons, 61% believed that evidence supported surgical AF ablation reducing the incidence of thrombo-embolic complications, and 46% modified anticoagulation decision-making based on whether they performed AF ablation. During coronary artery bypass grafting, isolated pulmonary vein isolation was the most commonly performed lesion set (70%), whereas complete left atrial ablation (46%) and biatrial ablation (44%) were favoured with valve surgery. Conclusion In a multinational group of academic surgeons, surgical AF ablation utilization appears variable, and average case volumes are low. Despite no evidence to that effect, the majority believe that ablation reduces AF-related thrombo-embolic risk of patients. Reported practice patterns suggest clinical equipoise; a definitive trial appears feasible based on respondent willingness to participate. ? Published on behalf of the European Society of Cardiology.

However, most of what is known is derived from in vivo subcortical white-matter imaging or postmortem studies. In this study, we investigated wholebrain intracortical myelin (ICM) content in people with bipolar disorder type I and controls. Methods: Between Sept. 1, 2014, and Jan. 31, 2017, we used a 3 T General Electric scanner to collect T1-weighted images in 45 people with bipolar disorder type I and 60 controls aged 17 to 45 years using an optimized sequence that was sensitive to ICM content. We analyzed images using a surfacebased approach. We used general linear models with quadratic age terms to examine the signal trajectory of ICM across the age range. Results: In healthy controls, the T1-weighted signal followed an inverted-U trajectory over age; in people with bipolar disorder type I, the association between ICM and age followed a flat trajectory (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected). Exploratory analyses showed that ICM signal intensity was associated with duration of illness, age of onset, and anticonvulsant and antipsychotic use in people with bipolar disorder type I (p < 0.05, uncorrected). Limitations: Because of the cross-sectional nature of the study, we were unable to comment on whether the effects were due to dysmyelination or demyelination in bipolar disorder. Conclusion: This foundational study is, to our knowledge, the first to show global age-related deficits in ICM maturation throughout the cortex in bipolar disorder. Considering the impact of myelination on the maintenance of neural synchrony and the integrity of neural connections, this work may help us better understand the cognitive and behavioural deficits seen in bipolar disorder. ? 2019 Joule Inc. or its licensors.",,anticonvulsive agent; anxiolytic agent; lithium; adult; agoraphobia; alcoholism; anorexia nervosa; anterior cingulate; Article; bipolar disorder; body mass; clinical article; cognitive defect; controlled study; cross-sectional study; drug dependence; DSM-IV; female; human; hypomania; image analysis; male; myelination; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; panic; posterior cingulate; psychosis; social phobia; white matter; young adult,2-s2.0-85062250718

Method: Using qualitative interpretive description, this study recruited a purposeful sample of practitioners (N = 30, 90% female) implementing FBT for adolescent eating disorders. Semi-structured interviews focused on eliciting their perspectives regarding identifying and responding to CEA and CEIPV in practice. Interviews were conducted over the phone, were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using conventional content analysis. Interim member checking, the thoughtful clinician test, and coding memos were used to ensure the integrity of the analysis. Results: Participants were 31–57 years old and practicing FBT in five countries. Three data patterns emerged: (a) perceptions of child maltreatment prevalence and identification; (b) complicating factors; and finally (c) strategies to support family-based work. Practitioners described important considerations for CEA and CEIPV identification, as well as possible FBT adaptations that can support the safety of children and adolescents while simultaneously ensuring the treatment of the eating disorder. Conclusions: Practitioners describe a need for additional training to identify and respond to CEA and CEIPV within FBT and within practice more broadly.

Between May 2008 and August 2012, NYC DOHMH implemented a stair prompt initiative as one strategy in a comprehensive program to increase physical activity and healthy eating through physical improvements to NYC's buildings, streets and neighborhoods, particularly targeting facilities in underserved and low-income neighborhoods. Program evaluation was conducted using program planning documents to examine the process, and data from NYC information line call center, outreach tracking database, and site and phone audits to examine process outcomes. The initiative successfully distributed more than 30,000 stair prompts to building owners/managers of over 1000 buildings. Keys to success included multi-sector partnerships between NYC's Health Department and non-health government agencies and organizations (such as architecture and real estate organizations), a designated outreach coordinator, and outreach strategies targeting building owners/managers owning/managing multiple buildings and buildings serving underserved and at risk populations. A NYC citywide initiative successfully distributed stair prompts to the wider community to promote population-level health impacts; lessons learned may assist other jurisdictions considering similar initiatives to increase physical activity. ? 2018",Chronic disease; City planning; Obesity; Physical activity; Prevention; Program evaluation; Urban health,architecture; Article; building; call center; city planning; government; health care planning; human; lowest income group; neighborhood; physical activity; priority journal; program evaluation; public health; real estate; stair climbing; urban health,2-s2.0-85060063455

Young adults with chronic disabling health conditions are underrepresented in the labour market. Our study aims to examine the effectiveness of work-focused interventions that support the labour market transition of young adults with chronic disabling health conditions; and to examine whether the effectiveness of work-focused interventions differ across work transition phase (eg, preparation, entry and sustaining work, employment advancement) and disability type. Methods: A systematic review of articles published between January 1990 and July 2018 was conducted. Medline, EMBASE and PsycInfo were searched, and titles/abstracts and full texts of articles were reviewed for eligibility. Relevant articles were appraised for methodological quality. A best evidence synthesis was applied to medium-quality/high-quality studies to develop recommendations. Results: 5816 articles were identified; 10 articles were relevant and of moderate-high methodological quality. Six intervention categories were identified which focused on young adults with mental health or intellectual/learning disabilities (n=3) and addressed employment preparation (n=10) and/or work entry (n=9). No interventions addressed at-work issues or career advancement. Strong evidence existed for tailored supported employment (SE) interventions having a positive impact on preparation and entry into competitive employment. Also, moderate evidence existed for the positive impact of SE on preparation and entry into competitive employment for young adults with mental health conditions. Conclusions: Tailored SE is recommended to foster preparation and entry into the labour market.

Methods: Climbers who participate in multipitch sport or traditional climbing styles were recruited via posters at a local climbing gym and on social media. Participants completed a survey assessing climbing history and confidence in their rescue skills and then were evaluated on 3 rescue scenarios in an indoor, standardized setting. Scenario pass rates were calculated and compared with rescue skill confidence on the survey. Results: Twenty-five climbers participated in the study. Mean confidence in rescue skills varied from 4 to 4.5 (on a 7-point scale). The pass rates for the 3 scenarios were 28%, 68%, and 52%. Only 24% of climbers passed all 3 scenarios. Surveyed confidence in rescue skills and pass rate statistically correlated in only 1 scenario. Conclusions: Self-rescue skills were generally lacking in our study population.

Pathway analysis for WHR adjBMI pleiotropic SNPs found immune function pathways as the top canonical pathways. Results from our original methodology indicate a novel genetic association between WHR adjBMI and reticulocyte counts and highlight the pleiotropy between abdominal obesity, immune pathways, and other traits. ? 2018 World Obesity Federation",genome-wide association study; pleiotropy; single nucleotide polymorphism; waist-to-hip ratio,"adiponectin; alanine aminotransferase; alkaline phosphatase; apolipoprotein B; bromodomain adjacent to zinc finger domain 1B; C reactive protein; hemoglobin; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; proline dipeptidase; protein; protein C; R spondin 3 homolog; triacylglycerol; unclassified drug; urea; vasculotropin A; zinc finger protein; abdominal obesity; alanine aminotransferase blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; Article; autoimmune disease; birth weight; blood pressure; body fat distribution; body height; body mass; cholesterol blood level; electrocardiography; erythrocyte count; female; gene linkage disequilibrium; genetic association; genetic variability; genome-wide association study; granulocyte; hematocrit; human; inflammation; insulin sensitivity; intra-abdominal fat; leukocyte count; male; malignant neoplasm; mental disease; newborn; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pleiotropy; reticulocyte count; signal transduction; single nucleotide polymorphism; skinfold; subcutaneous fat; triacylglycerol blood level; waist hip ratio; genetic predisposition; genetics; national health organization; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; phenotype; pleiotropy; United States; Body Fat Distribution; Body Mass Index; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Genetic Pleiotropy; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; National Human Genome Research Institute (U.S.); Obesity; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; United States; Waist-Hip Ratio",2-s2.0-85058931823

However, the complexity in the nursing milieu can pose threats to integrity. An understanding of the common threats and coping strategies might assist nurses in preserving integrity in everyday practice. Aims and objectives: To review and synthesis the concept of integrity in nursing and identify common threats and coping strategies. Methods: Whittemore and Knafl's integrative review method was implemented. A search was performed in Scopus, Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Proquest Health and Medical electronic databases published in English between 2000–2017. Two reviewers independently assessed eligibility for inclusion. Methodological appropriateness for the included studies was assessed using the critical appraisal skills programme. The constant comparative method of grounded theory was used to analyse and synthesise data from seven peer-reviewed articles. Results: Two major conceptions of integrity were identified. These included the sense of wholeness with regard to personal–professional concerns and ethical–moral conducts. Five entities, self, patients, teamwork and work culture, the nature of work, and organisation, were identified as interweaving elements that may induce threats to integrity. When integrity is threatened, nurses use two key strategies to survive: adjusting and compensating. An emergent framework to facilitate understanding of nurses’ threats to integrity is discussed. Conclusions: A threat to nurses’ integrity takes form when there is an unmitigated gap between a nurse's expectation and reality. While the expectation comes from within the nurse, the reality materialises out of the complex interplays that occur in the healthcare workforce. Maintaining integrity demands a continual strive to balance personal expectations, professional concerns and nursing realities. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",literature review; nurse; nurse–patient relationship; nurse–physician relationship; nursing practice; personal integrity; psychological and social coping; psychosocial adjustment,"adult; article; Cinahl; conception; constant comparative method; coping behavior; Embase; expectation; female; grounded theory; human; male; Medline; morality; nurse patient relationship; nursing practice; PsycINFO; Scopus; skill; synthesis; systematic review; teamwork; workforce; medical ethics; nurse; organizational culture; psychology; Adaptation, Psychological; Ethics, Nursing; Grounded Theory; Humans; Nurses; Organizational Culture",2-s2.0-85056667709

A trial of labour with unfavourable intrauterine positioning is hypothesized to result in excessive force on the brachial plexus. The purpose of this study was to determine the risk of BPBI in emergent CS versus elective CS. Methods: This was a retrospective cohort study. The authors used a nationwide demographic sample of all infants born in Canada from 2004 to 2012. BPBI diagnoses, risk factors, and national incidence data were obtained from the Canadian Institute for Health Information Discharge Abstract Database and Hospital Morbidity Database. The primary outcome was risk of BPBI in emergent CS versus elective CS. Results: BPBI incidence was 1.24 per 1000 live births. Known biases may have underestimated the incidence. CS (elective and emergent) was protective for BPBI as compared with vaginal delivery (odds ratio [OR] 0.15; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.13–0.18, P < 0.0001). Emergent CS was a moderately strong risk factor for BPBI versus elective CS (OR 3.14; 95% CI 1.79–5.10, P = 0.0001). Conclusion: Emergent CS is a moderate risk factor for BPBI compared with elective CS. Intrauterine positioning with a trial of labour may provide an antenatal etiology in these distinct cases. ? 2019",emergency CS; incidence; Obstetrical brachial plexus injury,Article; birth injury; brachial plexus injury; cesarean section; cohort analysis; emergency surgery; human; incidence; infant; major clinical study; newborn; retrospective study; risk factor; vaginal delivery,2-s2.0-85055965873

However, no studies have examined how the pattern varies longitudinally in a Canadian population of heterogeneous ethnicity. Methods: We analyzed data from 3,138 mothers participating in the Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) Study, a longitudinal multi-center study incorporating 10 distinct waves of psychosocial data collection from pregnancy until the index child was aged 5 y. Maternal self-identified ethnicity was grouped as White Caucasian, First Nations, Black, Southeast Asian, East Asian, South Asian, Middle Eastern, Hispanic and mixed ethnicity. We performed a multi-level regression to determine whether mothers of specific minority ethnicities were more likely to experience higher levels of distress (i.e. depressive symptoms and perceived stress) compared to white Caucasian mothers. Results: Mothers self-identifying as Black or First Nations had consistently higher distress scores than mothers from other ethnicities across all data collection times. After adjusting for relevant variables (history of depression, education, household income, marital status, and social support), First Nations mothers had a 20% increase in the mean scores of depressive symptoms compared to White Caucasian Mothers. Conclusions: Increased levels of perinatal and post-partum distress were seen in only some ethnic minority groups. Studies should avoid collapsing all categories into ethnic minority or majority and may need to consider how ethnicity interacts with other sociodemographic factors such as poverty. ?

This study assessed the effectiveness of food environment interventions incorporating financial incentive or social marketing strategies at workplace cafeterias, vending machines, and kiosks toward preventing obesity and improving dietary habits. Methods: We conducted searches on CENTRAL, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases. The study designs included were randomized control trials (RCTs) and cluster RCTs.

Methods: Eight undergraduate volunteer examiners were trained to conduct vision screening tests to address a gap in pediatric community eye care. Phase I of the study was implemented in the pediatric ophthalmology clinic, and phase II was conducted in nine local schools. Phase I consisted of 40 h of training for each volunteer regarding specific vision tests. Phase II consisted of screening children at nine local schools. Results: A total of 690 children from nine local schools were screened by both the volunteer examiners and the optometrist during the course of this study. Volunteer examiners had a screening sensitivity of 0.80 (95%CI 0.66-0.90) and screening specificity of 0.75 (95%CI 0.71-0.78) when compared to the study optometrist. The overall accuracy of volunteer examiners was 75%. The resulting positive likelihood ratio was 3.24 (95%CI 2.6-3.9), indicating that a child with vision impairment was 3.2 times more likely to fail the vision test performed by the volunteer examiners compared to a child with no vision impairment.

Methods: A prospective cohort study was conducted. Participants were 26 adults with moderate-severe TBI (13 older and 13 younger) and 26 uninjured peers matched for age, sex, and education. Emotion recognition was measured using the Emotion Recognition Task, which is comprised of dynamically morphed facial expressions of the six basic emotions, presented at different intensity levels. Results : TBI and older age were associated with poorer recognition of both subtle and intense expressions, but only for expressions of anger and sadness. There was no interaction of age and TBI. Conclusions: Results add to the growing evidence of emotion recognition impairments after TBI, particularly for select negative emotions, and extend this finding to adults over the age of 60.

Understanding sensitization patterns helps clinicians tailor care more effectively. This study examines patterns of sensitization to aeroallergens in subjects suspected of having an allergic disease in Edmonton and catchment area. Methods: Retrospective chart review of skin prick test (SPT) results to 11 environmental aeroallergens performed between January 1st and June 30th 2014 at a University-based clinic, where patients are referred for SPT by allergists, respirologists, otolaryngologists, internists and general practitioners. Potential differences in aeroallergen sensitization patterns were evaluated. Results: A total of 623 patients (36.9% males; 63.1% females), aged 4-84 years (mean age 38.6 years) had SPT done, of which 438 (70.3%) had a positive test for at least one aeroallergen (atopy). There were no significant sex differences in the frequency of atopy (males: 71.3% versus females: 69.7%; p = 0.373). The frequency of sensitivity to particular allergens among atopic subjects was: cat (53.1%), house dust mites (50.3%), grass (39.2%), birch (23.7%), alternaria (23.7%), dog (17.3%), poplar (12.1%), cedar (9.6%), aspergillus (9.6%), hormodendrum (8%), and penicillium (6.2%). Of 438 atopic patients, 110 (25.1%) were mono sensitized, 199 (45.4%) oligosensitized (2-3 allergens), and 129 (29.5%) polysensitized (? 4 allergens). There were no significant differences between males and females in the odds of being oligo-sensitized (OR: 0.95; 95% CI 0.58, 1.57). Polysensitization was significantly more frequent in males 37.2% than in females 24.8%; (OR: 0.95; 95% CI 0.58, 1.57). Conclusion: Cat is the most frequent perennial allergen and timothy grass pollen the most frequent seasonal allergen in Edmonton and catchment area.

Inflammation in UC is limited to the mucosa of the colon and rectum while Crohn's disease is associated with transmural inflammation in any portion of the gastrointestinal tract. In addition, Crohn's disease is also associated with extraintestinal manifestations in areas such as the skin, joints, and eyes.

To systematically review evidence addressing the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) and opioid tapering for opioid-induced hypogonadism among patients with chronic noncancer pain. Study Design. Systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies. Methods. We searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, AMED, CENTRAL, CINAHL, DARE, EMBASE, and PsycINFO through August 2017. Eligible studies enrolled 10 patients with chronic noncancer pain and opioid-induced hypogonadism and reported the effect of TRT or opioid tapering on a patient-important outcome collected 14 days after treatment. Pairs of reviewers independently screened for eligible studies, assessed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used the GRADE approach to rate quality of evidence. Results. Of 666 abstracts reviewed, five studies including one RCT (N 5 84) and four observational studies (N 5 157) were eligible. No studies explored the effect of opioid tapering for opioid-induced hypogonadism. Very low-quality evidence found that TRT was associated with improvements in pain (median reduction of 2 points on the 11-point numerical rating scale for pain; 95% confidence interval [CI] 5 –1.4 to –2.6; minimally important difference [MID] 5 2 points), and emotional functioning (mean increase of 9 points on the 100-point SF-36 Mental Component Summary score; 95% CI 5 4.40 to 13.60; MID 5 5 points). Low-quality evidence suggested that TRT had no effect on sleep quality, sexual function, physical functioning, role functioning, or social functioning; very low-quality evidence suggested no association with depressive symptoms.

In combination with screening initiatives, new and evolving treatment approaches have contributed to significant improvements in survival in a number of cancer types. For Canadian cancer survivors, the 5-year survival rate is now better than it was a decade ago, and the survivor population is expected to reach 2 million by 2031. Notwithstanding those improvements, many cancer survivors experience late and long-term effects, and comorbid conditions have been noted to be increasing in prevalence for this vulnerable population. In view of those observations, and considering the anticipated shortage of oncology providers, increasing reliance is being placed on the primary care workforce for the provision of survivorship care. Despite the willingness of pcps to engage in that role, further substantial efforts to elucidate the landscape of high-quality, sustainable, and comprehensive survivorship care delivery within primary care are required. The present article offers an overview of the integration of pcps into survivorship care provision. More specifically, it outlines known barriers and potential solutions in five categories: ■■ Survivorship care coordination ■■ Knowledge of survivorship ■■ pcp-led clinical environments ■■ Models of survivorship care ■■ Health policy and organizational advocacy. ? 2019 Multimed Inc.",Education; Primary care providers; Survivorship,adult; article; cancer survival; cancer survivor; coordination; education; health care policy; human; landscape; oncology; prevalence; prevention; primary medical care; season; survival rate; survivorship; vulnerable population; workforce,2-s2.0-85062696140

This paper is concerned with, first, situating sanctions against the Global South as violence by challenging the conventional theorisation of violence inflicted by the hegemon as a mechanism of ‘national security’.

However, there is a scarcity of research on story-based health education among women in South Asian diasporic communities. To address this gap, we undertook a pilot study in Toronto to explore how South Asian women respond to the use of fact-based and story-based materials for HIV/STI prevention. A total of 78 women were recruited from across the city. We engaged nearly half of the women (n=40) using fact sheets on HIV/STIs, and the remainder (n=38) using stories written by South Asian women on HIV/STIs. Surveys and focus groups were used to explore participants' responses in terms of knowledge, attitudes and perspectives. Results indicated that both approaches were effective in increasing participants' knowledge of HIV/STIs. Participants in the fact-based sessions tended to distance themselves from the idea of personal HIV/STI risks. Participants in the story-based groups were emotionally engaged, expressing personal commitments to take a stand against HIV stigma. In summary, within-culture stories are potentially effective tools that enable women to make sense of their own life situations and contextual vulnerabilities. Story-based materials are useful for breaking the silence of taboo topics, addressing stigma and discrimination and raising awareness about collective empowerment. ? ° The Author(s) 2018.

The study investigates the associations between risk factors such as mammographic density, hormone therapy use and family history and the effectiveness of screening mammography with or without CBE. Methods: The cohort consists of women 50–69 years old screened at the Ontario Breast Screening Program. The associations of the risk factors were investigated using a joint logistic regression model that accommodates the partially unobserved disease status, clustered data structures, individual risk factors, and the dependence between true and false detection. Results: Having high mammographic density, a first degree relative with breast cancer and using hormone therapy generally increased a woman's probability of being referred correctly. For low risk group (defined as without dense breasts, family history, and not currently using hormone therapy), the average loss of specificity ranged from 3.6% to 5.7% and the gain of sensitivity was between 10.6% and 21.2% with the addition of CBE. Conclusions: The addition of CBE to mammography would increase the overall sensitivity and decrease the specificity. CBE can be targeted to those women in which it has the highest net benefit. ? 2018",Breast clinical examination; Clustered analysis; Detection rate; Mammography; Sensitivity; Specificity,adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; breast examination; cancer screening; clinical effectiveness; cohort analysis; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; false negative result; family history; female; first-degree relative; health program; hormonal therapy; human; low risk patient; major clinical study; mammography; priority journal; risk benefit analysis; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; breast density; breast tumor; diagnostic imaging; early cancer diagnosis; estrogen therapy; middle aged; patient referral; physical examination; procedures; risk assessment; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Breast Density; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Early Detection of Cancer; Estrogen Replacement Therapy; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Mammography; Middle Aged; Physical Examination; Referral and Consultation; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Sensitivity and Specificity,2-s2.0-85059319278

In many situations, AST testing provides little or no added clinical value, since ALT is more specific and the both enzyme activities highly correlate. The objective of this study is to determine the potential reduction in AST testing, if not performed when ALT results are within reference intervals (RI). Methods: Results for patients >18 years of age for both AST and ALT from the same specimen were obtained for the period January 1, 2017 – December 31, 2017. We calculated frequency of AST and ALT results that had various combinations of results within and above the RI. We also investigated the clinical locations of origin for the samples. Results: In total 87,704 paired samples with both AST and ALT test results were recovered. The total of 73.2% of AST tests for males and 66.9% for females would be eliminated if we performed AST testing only when ALT was increased. However, 7.4% of elevated AST tests would be missed for males and 3.8% for females due to ALT being within limits. Specifically in the outpatient clinics, 79% male and 73% females paired enzyme results were within RI. Only 4% of males and 3% of females had paired results where ALT was within RI while AST > RI. Conclusions: The rate of test results with increased AST while ALT is within the RI is low enough to recommend limiting AST testing only to cases where ALT is above the RI. Our recommendation for AST restriction is to begin with the hospitals outpatient clinics. ? 2018 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists",AST; Liver disease; Test utilization,"alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; alanine aminotransferase; aspartate aminotransferase; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; enzyme assay; female; hospital; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; reference value; sex difference; aged; blood; hospital laboratory; liver function test; middle aged; organization and management; outpatient department; sex factor; standard; standards; statistics and numerical data; unnecessary procedure; young adult; Adult; Aged; Alanine Transaminase; Aspartate Aminotransferases; Female; Humans; Laboratories, Hospital; Liver Function Tests; Male; Middle Aged; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; Procedures and Techniques Utilization; Reference Standards; Sex Factors; Unnecessary Procedures; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85058157030

The aims of this study were to evaluate whether therapy with benznidazole modifies the progression of cardiac impairment and to identify baseline echocardiographic parameters related to prognosis. Methods: A prospective substudy was conducted in 1,508 patients with chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy randomized to benznidazole or placebo, who underwent two-dimensional echocardiography at enrollment, 2 years, and final follow-up (5.4 years). Left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, LV wall motion score index (WMSI), indexed left atrial volume, and chamber dimensions were collected and correlated to all-cause death and a composite hard outcome using univariate and multivariate analyses. Results: At enrollment, most patients had normal chamber dimensions, and 70.5% had preserved LV ejection fractions. During follow-up, all chamber dimensions increased similarly in both treatment arms. LV ejection fraction was comparably reduced (55.7 ± 12.7% to 52.1 ± 14.6% vs 56.3 ± 12.7% to 52.8 ± 14.1%) and LV WMSI similarly increased (1.31 ± 0.41 to 1.49 ± 0.03 and 1.27 ± 0.38 to 1.51 ± 0.03) for the benznidazole and placebo groups, respectively (P >.05). A higher baseline LV WMSI was identified in subjects who died compared with those alive at final echocardiography (1.76 ± 0.517 vs 1.271 ± 0.393, P <.0001). There was a significant (P <.0001) graded increase in the risk for the composite outcome with worsening LV WMSI (hazard ratios, 2.27 [95% CI, 1.69–3.06] and 6.42 [95% CI, 4.94–8.33]) and also of death (hazard ratios, 2.45 [95% CI, 1.62–3.71] and 8.99 [95% CI, 6.3–12.82]) for 1 < LV WMSI < 1.5 and LV WMSI > 1.5, respectively. Both LV WMSI and indexed left atrial volume remained independent predictors in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Trypanocidal treatment had no effect on echocardiographic progression of chronic Chagas cardiomyopathy over 5.4 years. Despite normal global LV systolic function, regional wall motion abnormalities and indexed left atrial volume identified patients at higher risk for hard adverse clinical outcomes. ? 2018 American Society of Echocardiography",Chagas cardiomyopathy; Echocardiography; Prognosis; Trypanocidal therapy,benznidazole; placebo; adult; aged; all cause mortality; Article; cardiovascular parameters; Chagas cardiomyopathy; controlled study; echocardiography; female; follow up; heart left atrium; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle wall motion; human; major clinical study; male; prognosis; prospective study; two dimensional echocardiography; wall motion score index,2-s2.0-85056351569

We examined the impact of thrombocytopenia on low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) dosing and incidence of bleeding in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) who developed thromboembolism (TE) during therapy according to DFCI ALL protocols. Procedure: Patient records from our tertiary care center were reviewed for demographics, details of diagnoses and therapy of ALL/LL and TE diagnoses, platelet counts during ACT, LMWH dosing, and bleeding episodes. Results: Thirty-nine TEs were diagnosed in 33 patients [mean age 9 years (range, 2.5–18); 16 males and 31 with ALL] during the study period. A majority (85%) of patients were diagnosed with TE in the consolidation phase with mean time to TE 5.75 months from ALL/LL diagnosis. All patients received LMWH, and the median duration of ACT was 5.9 months (range, 1–11 months). Platelets were measured weekly. On 29 occasions, platelet nadir was?&lt;50?×?109/L, and twice it was?&lt;?20?×?109/L. One (3%) patient had major bleeding episode while on ACT. Platelet count at the time of bleeding was 222?×?109/L. Ninety-two procedures [83 lumbar punctures (LPs), 9 central venous line (CVL) insertion/revision] were completed without bleeding complications. Asparaginase was held temporarily with TE diagnosis in 48% of patients; most (88%) patients completed all scheduled doses as per protocol. Conclusions: Ability to administer full-dose LMWH, expected bleeding rate, and completion of asparaginase doses while on ACT suggest full-dose ACT is feasible and safe in children with ALL/LL who develop TE during DFCI ALL consortium therapy protocols. ? 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",acute lymphoblastic leukemia; anticoagulation therapy; low-molecular-weight heparin; thrombocytopenia; thromboembolism,"anticoagulant agent; antineoplastic agent; low molecular weight heparin; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; adolescent; bleeding; child; cohort analysis; complication; feasibility study; female; human; incidence; male; preschool child; retrospective study; thrombocytopenia; thromboembolism; Adolescent; Anticoagulants; Antineoplastic Agents; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Feasibility Studies; Female; Hemorrhage; Heparin, Low-Molecular-Weight; Humans; Incidence; Male; Precursor Cell Lymphoblastic Leukemia-Lymphoma; Retrospective Studies; Thrombocytopenia; Thromboembolism",2-s2.0-85055495102

Patients and Methods: Data from 1082 patients of the Retrospective International Study of Invasive/Advanced Cancer of the Urothelium database, treated from February 1990 to December 2013 at 27 centers in the United States, Europe, Israel, and Canada, were collected. Locoregional relapse was defined as any pelvic lymph node or soft tissue-only recurrences. Cumulative incidence methods were used to estimate time to locoregional relapse (TTR L ). Cox regression analyses were performed and a nomogram for 12-month locoregional relapse-free survival (RFS) was developed. The nomogram was applied to an external data set (n = 1021). Results: A total of 517 patients (47.8%) developed a relapse: 177 (16.4%) exclusive locoregional relapse. In multivariable analyses, perioperative chemotherapy was associated with longer TTR L (P &lt;.001). Other factors were nonurothelial histology (P =.013), pT-stage (P &lt;.001), and surgical margins (P &lt;.001). The concordance index of the model was 0.681 (95% bootstrapped confidence interval, 0.666-0.716). Risk group categories were obtained according to nomogram tertiles. Despite, overall, observed locoregional RFS in the validation cohort exceeding predicted results, for high-risk patients (80 points or less, lowest nomogram tertile) observed 12-month RFS was similar between development and validation cohorts (60.1% and 66.6%). The study is limited by its retrospective nature. Conclusion: In the largest study, to our knowledge, that analyzed locoregional recurrences after RC, we propose a risk prediction tool for exclusive locoregional failures that might be suitable for clinical studies. Patients best suited for adjuvant radiotherapy might be those within the lowest nomogram tertile.

Community paramedicine is an emerging field that extends the role of paramedics beyond the traditional emergency response. The goal of the current study is to evaluate the impact of a community paramedicine home-visit intervention with frequent users on reducing ambulance calls, hospital visits, and admissions. The study will also provide a cross-sectional description of the characteristics of frequent users of emergency medical services. Methods/design: An open-label, pragmatic, randomized controlled trial with parallel intervention and control groups will be conducted in four paramedic services in Ontario. The sample size has been calculated as 261 per group for a 25% reduction in ambulance calls. Eligible participants will be frequent callers (three or more calls in 6 months), individuals who call for at least one lift assist, or individuals referred to the program by a paramedic. Individuals will be randomly allocated to receive either the Community Paramedicine at Home (CP@home) program intervention or their usual care (control). Intervention participants will receive up to three visits from a community paramedic, who will conduct health risk assessments, provide health promotion and education, provide referrals to local resources, and fax reports back to the family physician. Data will be collected from administrative databases (e.g., paramedic services), a custom CP@home program database, participant surveys, and key informant interviews. An intention-to-treat analysis will be conducted, including descriptive statistics and multi-level modeling to find factors predictive of primary and secondary outcomes. A thematic analysis will be used to analyze the qualitative outcomes. An economic analysis will consider the cost-effectiveness of the program. Discussion: CP@home has the potential to reduce the health-care system burden significantly by targeting current frequent users of emergency medical services. By targeting this population, CP@home aims to decrease ambulance calls and emergency department visits, reducing health-care costs and improving the quality of life of a vulnerable population. If successful, CP@home will inform the development of community paramedicine policies and the expanding role of paramedics in regions across Canada.

It is unknown whether RSV prophylaxis is effective, or if RSVH is associated with significant morbidities in CMC. The study objectives were to (1) determine the incidence of RSV-related infection in prophylaxed CMC during the first 3?years of life and (2) assess the burden of illness following RSVH. A single tertiary center, retrospective study, was conducted of CMC who received palivizumab during the 2012–2016 RSV seasons. Fifty-four subjects were enrolled; most received one (38.9%, n?= 21) or two (57.4%, n?= 31) seasons of prophylaxis (mean?= 4.2 [SD = 1.24], palivizumab doses per season). The cohort comprised children with multiple medical conditions (n?= 22, 40.8%), tracheostomy (n?= 18, 33.3%), and invasive (n?= 10, 18.5%) or non-invasive (n?= 4, 7.4%) ventilation. Of the CMC, 24 were hospitalized 47 times for a viral-related respiratory illness. RSV incidence in the first 3?years of life was 7.4%. Viral-related RIH and RSVH rates were 44.4% (n?= 24/54) and 1.9% (n?= 1/54), respectively. Of the four RSV-positive children, one was ventilated for 9?days, two acquired nosocomial RSV that was managed on the ward, and one was discharged home under close complex care supervision. All four RSV-positive cases required additional oxygen during their illness. CMC experience a high viral-related RIH rate and palivizumab likely minimizes RSV-related events and associated morbidities. The efficacy of palivizumab in CMC, especially in those ? 3?years, should be prospectively evaluated. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Children; Medical complexity; Outcomes; Palivizumab; Respiratory syncytial virus,"palivizumab; antivirus agent; Article; child; child hospitalization; childhood disease; clinical article; female; follow up; hospital admission; hospital infection; human; male; medical record review; oxygen therapy; pediatric ward; priority journal; respiratory syncytial virus infection; retrospective study; season; tracheostomy; ventilated patient; viral respiratory tract infection; antibiotic prophylaxis; comorbidity; complication; Human respiratory syncytial virus; infant; newborn; preschool child; respiratory syncytial virus infection; treatment outcome; virology; Antibiotic Prophylaxis; Antiviral Agents; Child, Preschool; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Palivizumab; Respiratory Syncytial Virus Infections; Respiratory Syncytial Virus, Human; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85055990099

Our study explored these factors. An online survey (descriptive cross-sectional design) was distributed to Canadian postgraduate year (PGY) 1 and 2 internal medicine (IM) residents. Questions probed self-confidence in rheumatology and factors influencing subspecialty career choice. Frequencies were determined and responses compared between PGY-1 and PGY-2 using univariate statistical analyses. Fifty-four IM residents completed the survey. PGY-2 residents were statistically more certain in subspecialty decidedness and had higher levels of self-confidence to diagnose/treat MSK disease and perform a physical exam. “Quality of life” was the most encouraging factor for a rheumatology career choice followed by “job opportunities” and “previous clinical exposure.” Although 50% of PGY-1 residents had completed a rheumatology clinical rotation, 76% indicated that increased knowledge would affect rheumatology career choice. Only 38% were interested in novel rheumatology education. No difference in rheumatology exposure, rheumatology clinical rotation completion year, or rheumatology career choice was observed. Our research confirms findings from similar United States (US) and United Kingdom (UK) studies that suggest that increased MSK knowledge positively influences residents’ confidence to diagnose/treat MSK disease. Our study differs with Canadian PGY-1 and PGY-2 IM residents by evaluating self-confidence to diagnose/treat MSK disease separately from self-confidence to perform a physical exam. Significant differences between first and second year trainees suggest types/quality of rheumatology experiences (e.g., case complexity, diagnostic problem-solving competency) may affect self-confidence to diagnose/treat MSK disease factors and rheumatology career choice. ? 2018, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).",Fellowship/career choice; Internal medicine; Musculoskeletal disease; Resident education; Rheumatology; Self-confidence,Article; Canada; decision making; experience; female; human; male; musculoskeletal disease; physical examination; physician attitude; postgraduate education; priority journal; professional knowledge; quality of life; resident; rheumatology; clinical competence; cross-sectional study; education; internal medicine; medical education; musculoskeletal disease; questionnaire; self concept; statistics and numerical data; Canada; Career Choice; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Internal Medicine; Internship and Residency; Male; Musculoskeletal Diseases; Quality of Life; Rheumatology; Self Concept; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85050311277

Objectives: The objectives of this study were to determine whether access to care, rurality, or socioeconomic status are associated with melanoma stage at presentation and prognosis. Methods: Linked administrative databases from Ontario, Canada, were retrospectively analyzed to identify a population-based cohort of patients diagnosed with melanoma between 2004 and 2012. Rurality was assessed using the rural index of Ontario (RIO) score, and the number of visits to dermatology and primary care was used to evaluate access to care. Results: We identified 18 776 melanoma patients, of whom 9591 had completed pathological staging. Patients with higher RIO scores, living further from a cancer center or in a rural community, were less likely to see a dermatologist in the year prior to diagnosis (P <.001 for all). Patients seen by a dermatologist within 365 days prior to diagnosis were less likely to present with stage III or IV disease (odds ratio 0.63, P <.001) and had improved overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] for death 0.77, P <.001). There was a nonlinear association between number of family physician visits and melanoma prognosis, with patients who had 3 to 5 visits per year having the best overall survival (HR 0.88, P =.003). Conclusion: Our findings strengthen the known association between access to dermatology and melanoma outcomes by linking individual patients’ prediagnosis access to care to pathological stage at diagnosis and overall survival. ?

Background: Recent work has demonstrated great potential for mental skills training in surgery. However, as a field, we lag far behind other high-performance domains that explicitly train and practice mental skills to promote optimal performance. Surgery stands to benefit from this work. First, there is a need to identify which mental skills might be most useful in surgery and how they might be best employed. Methods: Using a constructivist grounded theory approach, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 17 surgeons across the United States and Canada who had previously performed at an elite level in sport, music, or the military. Results: Mental skills were used both to optimize performance in the moment and longitudinally. In the moment, skills were used proactively to enter an ideal performance state, and responsively to address unwanted thoughts or emotions to re-enter an acceptable performance zone. Longitudinally, participants used skills to build expertise and maintain wellness. Conclusions: Establishing a taxonomy for mental skills in surgery may help in the development of robust mental skills training programs to promote optimal surgeon wellness and performance. ? 2019 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

However, the impact of CAWHs on their quality of life is unknown, and few descriptions of patient experiences exist. We performed a qualitative study to explore cancer survivors’ experience with CAWHs before and after repair. Methods: Patients waiting to undergo CAWH repair or who had completed the surgery in the previous 18 months were identified from a single surgeon’s practice in CAWH at a tertiary care centre. Clinical and demographic data were extracted from the electronic patient record. An in-depth semistructured interview guide was developed by experts in CAWH and qualitative methodology. Interviews were conducted in March 2013. We used comparative analysis techniques and coding strategies to identify themes. Results: Ten preoperative and 12 postoperative participants were interviewed. The average age of the participants was 64 years in both groups, with an even sex distribution. The most frequently diagnosed cancer in both groups was colorectal cancer. Participants’ views were organized into 5 themes: 1) unable to return to normal life, 2) sense of abandonment, 3) experiencing fear and distress, 4) preoperative: desperate for help and 5) postoperative: “getting my life back.” Conclusions: Our findings show the all-encompassing impact of a CAWH on the life of cancer survivors.

Computer-aided detection (CAD) is a software technology that has become widespread in radiology practices, particularly in breast cancer screening for improving detection rates at earlier stages. Many studies have investigated the diagnostic accuracy of CAD, but its implementation in clinical settings has been largely overlooked. Objective: The aim of this scoping review was to summarize recent literature on the adoption and implementation of CAD during breast cancer screening by radiologists and to describe barriers and facilitators for CAD use. Methods: The MEDLINE database was searched for English, peer-reviewed articles that described CAD implementation, including barriers or facilitators, in breast cancer screening and were published between January 2010 and March 2018. Articles describing the diagnostic accuracy of CAD for breast cancer detection were excluded. The search returned 526 citations, which were reviewed in duplicate through abstract and full-text screening. Reference lists and cited references in the included studies were reviewed. Results: A total of nine articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles showed that there is a tradeoff between the facilitators and barriers for CAD use. Facilitators for CAD use were improved breast cancer detection rates, increased profitability of breast imaging, and time saved by replacing double reading. Identified barriers were less favorable perceptions of CAD compared to double reading by radiologists, an increase in recall rates of patients for further testing, increased costs, and unclear effect on patient outcomes. Conclusions: There is a gap in the literature between CAD's well-established diagnostic accuracy and its implementation and use by radiologists. Generally, the perceptions of radiologists have not been considered and details of implementation approaches for adoption of CAD have not been reported. The cost-effectiveness of CAD has not been well established for breast cancer screening in various populations. Further research is needed on how to best facilitate CAD in radiology practices in order to optimize patient outcomes, and the views of radiologists need to be better considered when advancing CAD use. ? 2019 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Barth syndrome (BTHS), a life-threatening disease typically diagnosed with cardiomyopathy and neutropenia, is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial transacylase tafazzin. By high-resolution 31P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with cryoprobe technology, recently we found a dramatic loss of choline plasmalogen in the tafazzin-knockdown (TAZ-KD) mouse heart, besides observing characteristic cardiolipin (CL) alterations in BTHS. In inner mitochondrial membrane where tafazzin locates, CL and diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine are known to be essential via lipid–protein interactions reflecting their cone shape for integrity of respiratory chain supercomplexes and cristae ultrastructure. Here, we investigate the TAZ-KD brain, liver, kidney, and lymphoblast from patients compared with controls. We identified common yet markedly cell type–dependent losses of ethanolamine plasmalogen as the dominant plasmalogen class therein. Tafazzin function thus critically relates to homeostasis of plasmalogen, which in the ethanolamine class has conceivably analogous and more potent molecular functions in mitochondria than diacyl phosphatidylethanolamine. The present discussion of a loss of plasmalogen–protein interaction applies to other diseases with mitochondrial plasmalogen loss and aberrant forms of this organelle, including Alzheimer’s disease. ? 2019 Kimura et al.",,,2-s2.0-85071198401

Objectives: To propose a comprehensive definition of SMM, to create an empirically justified list of SMM types and subtypes, and to use this to examine SMM in Canada. Methods: Severe maternal morbidity was defined as a set of heterogeneous maternal conditions known to be associated with severe illness and with prolonged hospitalisation or high case fatality. Candidate SMM types/subtypes were evaluated using information on all hospital deliveries in Canada (excluding Quebec), 2006-2015. SMM rates for 2012-2016 were quantified as a composite and as SMM types/subtypes. Rate ratios and population attributable fractions (PAF) associated with overall and specific SMM types/subtypes were estimated in relation to length of hospital stay (LOS?>?7?days) and case fatality. Results: There were 22?799 cases of SMM subtypes (among 1?418?545 deliveries) that were associated with a prolonged LOS or high case fatality.

Severe pre-eclampsia and HELLP syndrome (514.6 per 100?000 deliveries), and severe postpartum haemorrhage (433.2 per 100?000 deliveries) were the most common SMM types, while case fatality rates among SMM subtypes were highest among women who had cardiac arrest and resuscitation (241.1 per 1000), hepatic failure (147.1 per 1000), dialysis (67.6 per 1000), and cerebrovascular accident/stroke (51.0 per 1000). The PAF for prolonged hospital stay related to SMM was 17.8% (95% CI 17.3, 18.3), while the PAF for maternal death associated with SMM was 88.0% (95% CI 74.6, 94.4). Conclusions: The proposed definition of SMM and associated list of SMM subtypes could be used for standardised SMM surveillance, with rate ratios and PAFs associated with specific SMM types/subtypes serving to inform clinical practice and public health policy. ? 2019 The Authors.

Dr. Arti Hurria identified this gap at the outset of her career, which she dedicated toward studying the geriatric assessment (GA) as an improvement over traditional methods used in oncology to assess vulnerability in older patients with cancer. This review documents the progress of the GA and its integration into oncology. First, we detail the GA's origins in the field of geriatrics. Next, we chronicle the early rise of geriatric oncology, highlighting the calls of early thought-leaders to meet the demands of the rapidly aging cancer population. We describe Dr. Hurria's early efforts toward meeting these calls though the implementation of the GA in oncology research. We then summarize some of the seminal studies constituting the evidence base supporting GA's implementation. Finally, we lay out the evolution of cancer-focused guidelines recommending the GA, concluding with future needs to advance the next steps toward more widespread implementation in routine cancer care. Throughout, we describe Dr. Hurria's vision and its execution in driving progress of the GA in oncology, from her fellowship training to her co-authored guidelines recommending GA for all older adults with cancer—published in the year of her untimely death. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Arti Hurria; Geriatric assessment; Geriatric oncology; Risk stratification; Supportive care; Vulnerability,aged; aging; death; female; geriatric assessment; geriatrics; human; leadership; male; oncology; review; stratification; vision,2-s2.0-85071095845

Materials and methods: Text responses to open-ended questions of the Fatigue Impact and Severity Self-Assessment from 160 participants (mean age 22.4 years) across all GMFCS levels were coded using inductive line-by-line coding and then grouped together to generate larger categories for each question. Frequency counts associated with each category were then summarized descriptively by Gross Motor Function Classification System level. Results: The most commonly reported contributors to fatigue included the following: activity-related factors, general demands of life, sleep/rest, general health concerns, CP-related factors, mental health concerns, and environmental factors. The top five strategies participants reported to manage fatigue included rest or relaxation, sleeping or napping, changing or limiting their activities, being physically active, or using specific adaptations or assistive devices. Conclusions: Results from this study suggest that there are potentially modifiable factors, including activity level and sleep, that significantly contribute to fatigue for persons with CP; these could form the basis of interventions targeted at the prevention and management of fatigue.Implications for Rehabilitation As individuals with cerebral palsy who are physically active experience significant fatigue, clinicians need to address fatigue to enable these individuals to reap the health benefits of physical activity. Providing education and support to integrate self-management techniques, such as planning and pacing, may be an effective long-term strategy to support individuals to complete highly valued tasks. Interventions targeting modifiable fatigue-generating factors such as activity level, sleep, and mental health concerns are needed. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",adolescents; adults; cerebral palsy; Fatigue; management,,2-s2.0-85070310579

Unlike most periodically forced physical systems, for which the precise pattern of forcing is typically known, underlying patterns of seasonal variation in transmission rates can be estimated approximately at best, and only the period of forcing is accurately known. Yet solutions of epidemic models depend strongly on the forcing function, so dynamical predictions-such as changes in epidemic patterns that can be induced by demographic transitions or mass vaccination-are always subject to the objection that the underlying patterns of seasonality are poorly specified. Here, we demonstrate that the key bifurcations of the standard epidemic model are invariant to the shape of seasonal forcing if the amplitude of forcing is appropriately adjusted. Consequently, analyses applicable to real disease dynamics can be conducted with a smooth, idealized sinusoidal forcing function, and qualitative changes in epidemic patterns can be predicted without precise knowledge of the underlying forcing pattern. We find similar invariance in a seasonally forced predator-prey model, and conjecture that this phenomenon-and the associated robustness of predictions-might be a feature of many other periodically forced dynamical systems. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Dynamical systems; Infectious disease; Nonlinear oscillators; Predator-prey model; Seasonal forcing; SIR epidemic model,Disease control; Diseases; Dynamical systems; Ecology; Forecasting; Infectious disease; Non-linear oscillators; Predator-prey modeling; Seasonal forcing; SIR epidemic model; Predator prey systems; Article; basic reproduction number; disease transmission; epidemic; family; human; infection; mass immunization; measles; mumps; pertussis; predator prey interaction; rubella; seasonal variation,2-s2.0-85070263852

Preferred research methods (such as the randomized controlled trial) are based on assumptions that linear cause-and-effect relationships are discoverable through careful manipulation of variables under controlled conditions. Yet clinical intervention trials in practice are much more often done in environments which are in constant states of flux, with dynamic and unpredictable variables rather than settings where uniformity and control are routine. Graduate nursing programs should expose students with interests in clinical research to methods that will enable them to make sense of how to evaluate clinical interventions in real world conditions. In this paper, we discuss the relevance of concepts from the field of Complexity Science—with a focus on Complex Adaptive Systems—to clinical research and examine their potential value to guide nursing research that informs evidence-based nursing interventions. We argue that the introduction of these concepts into graduate nursing curricula is fundamental to the preparation of future nurse scientists who will address the complex healthcare problems of this century. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Clinical nursing research; Complexity; Graduate nursing education; Nursing,article; clinical evaluation; clinical nursing research; human; human experiment; nurse researcher; nursing education; nursing intervention; student,2-s2.0-85069951822

Strategies for injury prevention have long been accepted without clinical data informing which risk factors lead to serious injury. Objective: The objective of this study was to systematically review the impact of various pitching-related risk factors for UCL injury in baseball players from all levels of play. Evidence review: The electronic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE and PubMed were systematically searched until 4 March 2018, and pertinent data were abstracted by two independent reviewers. Search terms included 'ulnar collateral ligament', 'medial ulnar collateral ligament', 'Tommy John', 'risk' and 'association'. Inclusion criteria were English-language studies, level of evidence I-IV and studies reporting risk factors for UCL injury of the elbow in baseball players. Study quality was assessed using the methodological index for non-randomised studies (MINORS) criteria. The results are presented in a narrative summary. Findings: Pitching practices (workload and pitch characteristics) were reported in 9/15 studies. Specifically, three of four studies (n=1810) reported increased pitch workload as a risk factor for native UCL injury (p<0.001 to 0.02). The most common pitch characteristic reported was pitch velocity with four of five studies showing increased velocity being significantly associated with native UCL injury (p<0.01 to 0.02). Biomechanical risk factors reported were increased humeral retrotorsion (two studies; n=324), poor lower extremity and trunk balance (one study; n=42) and loss of total arc of shoulder motion (two studies; n=118), all significantly associated with UCL injury (p<0.0001 to 0.05). One of three studies assessing pitch workload as a risk factor for re-rupture of UCL reconstruction found a significant association (p<0.01). Conclusions and relevance: Pitching practices, reflected by increased pitch workload and velocity, were most commonly associated with UCL injury; however, the definition of workload (number of pitches per game, inning or season) was inconsistently reported. Biomechanical risk factors were less commonly reported and lack sufficient evidence to recommend preventative strategies. More quality data is needed to refine the current recommendations for injury prevention in baseball players. ? 2019 International Society of Arthroscopy, Knee Surgery and Orthopaedic Sports Medicine.",baseball; pitcher; risk factors; Tommy John surgery; ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction,baseball; biomechanics; body equilibrium; body movement; disease association; elbow injury; human; humerus; ligament injury; lower limb; priority journal; Review; risk factor; shoulder; sport injury; systematic review; torsion; trunk; ulnar collateral ligament (elbow); velocity; workload,2-s2.0-85069890597

ABLE offers a menu of scalable physical therapy exercises designed to enhance strength, balance, and agility for variable populations with frailty and dementia presenting with low to severe impairments. It is designed for older adults with dementia and fragility, aiming to harness the incentivizing ability of art and gaming to encourage playful, physical interactions. The project aims to establish synergy between physical interaction and creative engagement to reduce boredom, agitation and social isolation while enhancing physiological, affective and cognitive health. This paper reviews how our interdisciplinary team of software engineers, medical scientists and artist/designers work to adapt design thinking in this research, to create participatory roles for older adults and caregivers that take into account the limits to participation posed by various barriers and their differing interests and investment in participation. We discuss how participant feedback can be integrated into the software interface, app design and user experience to meet the diverse and variable needs of users, for both independent use and supported use in residence. As well, to meet the diverse needs of this complex population, we draw on HCI gaming research as well as neuroplasticity research to formulate interaction experiences that seek to teach learning that can translate across the physical, cognitive and affective needs of this population. In seeking to enhance both pleasure and learning, we speculate that users will engage in sustained use of the platform over time and translate learnings into everyday life, to improve their opportunities to achieve health and wellness objectives. This design approach recognizes the need to incorporate diverse research findings into our approach. It also requires we adjust participatory approaches to accommodate less able-bodied participants, and adopt techniques for integrating participant data into all elements of design work, to ensure a coherent interdisciplinary team approach. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Complex learning theory; Dementia; Fragility; Geriatrics; Human computer interaction; Interdisciplinary practice; Neuroplasticity; Participatory design; Physical therapy; Prevention; User interaction design,Application programs; Geriatrics; Neurodegenerative diseases; Neurophysiology; Physical therapy; Psychophysiology; User interfaces; Complex learning; Dementia; Fragility; Interdisciplinary practices; Neuroplasticity; Participatory design; Prevention; User interaction design; Human computer interaction,2-s2.0-85069858658

However, little is known about the extent to which teachers employ various strategies and whether strategy use varies across grades. This study aimed to determine the frequency distribution of reported use of a range of strategies in a large representative sample of teachers in Ontario, Canada, and their variation across grades (junior kindergarten to grade twelve). The teacher survey contained strategies derived from a positive behavior support questionnaire (PBSQ) and a behavioral health questionnaire (EIBHQ), eight items each. Among the PBSQ items, completed by 3004 teachers, “Expected student behaviors and routines are taught directly” was the most frequently endorsed at the “always” level (60.5%), while “Rewards are varied to maintain student interest” was the least at this same level (30.6%). Among the EIBHQ items, completed by 2801 teachers, “Provided social rewards, such as praise, encouragement, and affection, to promote desired behaviors” was the most frequently endorsed at the “daily” level (71.1%), while “Taught the student to solve problems by outlining steps, such as identifying the problem, generating multiple solutions, and selecting the best alternative” was the least frequently endorsed (24.8%). For all items, frequency of endorsement significantly decreased with increasing grade level suggesting that students in higher grades are less likely to be exposed to this particular group of strategies.

Motivation to change represents an individual's openness to engage in a behavior change strategy and is thought to be a crucial component of brief interventions. Neuroimaging techniques provide a translational tool to investigate the neurobiological mechanisms underlying potential mediators of treatment response, including motivation to change. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the effect of a brief intervention on motivation to change drinking behavior and neural alcohol taste cue reactivity. Methods: Non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers were randomized to receive a brief drinking intervention (n = 22) or an attention-matched control (n = 24). Three indices of motivation to change were assessed at baseline and after the intervention or control session: importance, confidence, and readiness. Immediately following the intervention or control session, participants also underwent an functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during which they completed an alcohol taste cues paradigm. Results: There was a significant effect of the brief intervention on increasing ratings of importance of changing drinking behavior, but not on ratings of confidence or readiness to change. Ratings of importance after the intervention or control session were associated with neural alcohol taste cue reactivity, but notably, this effect was only significant for participants who received the intervention. Individuals in the intervention condition showed a positive association between ratings of importance and activation in the precuneus, posterior cingulate, and insula. Conclusions: The brief drinking intervention was successful at improving one dimension of motivation to change among non-treatment-seeking heavy drinkers. The brief intervention moderated the relationship between ratings of importance and brain activation in circuitry associated with interoceptive awareness and self-reflection. Together, findings represent an initial step toward understanding the neurobiological mechanisms through which a brief intervention may improve motivation to change. ? 2007-2019 Frontiers Media S.A.

Although dose, volume, and hypofractionation have been suggested to affect RN rates, patient and treatment variability in this population make it difficult to clearly delineate the risk. We set out to establish the effect of fractionation on RN rates by reviewing patients receiving simultaneous multi-fraction and single-fraction treatment at our centre. Methods Patients receiving simultaneous (within 1 month) 1-fraction (SSRS) and 3-fraction (fSRS) radiosurgery treatments during 2012-2015 were identified in our institution’s database. Serial post-SRS magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was reviewed to determine RN and local recurrence. The effect of maximum dose, volume, whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT), and fractionation on RN development was assessed using logistic regression for paired data. Results are reported using odds ratios (ORS) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIS). Results Of 90 patients identified, 22 had at least a 6-month mri follow-up. Median follow-up was 320 days. The most common primary tumour type was non-small-cell lung cancer, followed by breast and rectal cancer. Radionecrosis developed in 16 patients [21 of 62 lesions (34%), with 4 being symptomatic (20%)]. Of the 21 lesions in which RN developed, 11 received 3 fractions, and 10 received 1 fraction. The or for the association between the incidence of RN and maximum dose was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.9 to 1.1); for fractionation it was 1.0 (95% CI: 0.3 to 3.6); for previous wbrt, it was 0.4 (95% CI: 0.2 to 1.2); and for a 10-unit increase in volume, it was 3.1 (95% CI: 1.0 to 9.6). Local recurrence developed in 8 patients (12%), 6 of whom belonged to the ssrs group. Conclusions Our results indicate that patients receiving srs for multiple brain metastases experience a higher rate of RN than is reported in the literature and poorer survival despite having equivalent local control. Maximum dose did not appear to be associated with RN risk in our cohort, but volume was significantly associated with RN risk. Although fractionated treatment did not directly lower the rate of RN in this population, it might have played a role in reducing the magnitude of the RN risk in large-volume lesions. Further investigation will help to delineate optimal dose and fractionation so as to minimize RN while maintaining local control in this group. ? 2019 Multimed Inc.",Brain metastasis; Radionecrosis; Stereotactic radiosurgery,adult; aged; Article; brain metastasis; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; clinical article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; follow up; human; hypofractionated radiotherapy; incidence; maximum permissible dose; melanoma; mortality; non small cell lung cancer; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; radiation dose; radiation necrosis; radiation oncologist; rectum cancer; renal cell carcinoma; robot assisted surgery; stereotactic radiosurgery; survival rate; systemic therapy; tumor volume; whole brain radiotherapy,2-s2.0-85069307409

Methods: Individuals with cerebral palsy (n=28 of 53 eligible participants; GMFCS levels I-V; follow-up mean age 35.1 years (standard deviation (SD) 14.4) participated in a longitudinal cohort study with 4.0 years (SD 1.2) follow-up. Traditional risk factors included waist circumference and systolic blood pressure. Non-traditional risk factors included carotid artery intima media thickness and distensibility, carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and flow-mediated dilation. Results: Absolute (0.31 mm (SD 0.13) vs 0.22 mm (SD 0.08), p=0.045, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 0.040, 0.151) and relative flow-mediated dilation (9.9 % (SD 4.7) vs 7.5 % (SD 2.6), p=0.049, 95% CI 0.464, 4.42) decreased, while carotid artery intima media thickness (0.52 mm (SD 0.17) vs 0.67 mm (SD 0.33), p=0.041, 95% CI -0.242, -0.074) increased from baseline to follow-up. No other risk factor changed significantly. Age at baseline was a significant independent predictor of carotid artery intima media thickness change (R-squared=0.261, p=0.031). Conclusion:Individuals with cerebral palsy experience significant changes in non-traditional risk factors for cardiovascular disease over 4 years, in the face of no changes in traditional risk factors. Compared with findings in the literature from the general population, these risk factors progress at a faster rate and at a younger age in individuals with cerebral palsy. ? 2019 Foundation of Rehabilitation Information.",Arterial stiffness; Cardiovascular disease; Cerebral palsy; Endothelial function; Risk factor,adult; aging; cardiovascular disease; cerebral palsy; complication; female; human; longitudinal study; male; pathology; physiology; risk factor; Adult; Aging; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cerebral Palsy; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85069294755

Cardio-oncology clinics (cocs) have emerged to address the issue; however, there is a paucity of data about the demographics and clinical outcomes of patients seen in the coc setting. Methods Cancer patients referred to The Ottawa Hospital coc were included in this retrospective observational study. Data collected were patient demographics, cancer type and stage, reason for referral, cardiac risk factors, cardiac assessments and treatment, and clinical outcomes. Results Between 2008 and 2015, 779 patients (516 women, 66%; 263 men, 34%) were referred to the coc. Median age of the patients at cancer diagnosis was 60 years (range: 18-90 years). The most frequent reasons for referral were decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (33%), pre-chemotherapy assessment (14%), and arrhythmia (14%). Treatment with cardiac medication was given in 322 patients (41%), 181 (56%) of whom received more than 2 cardiac medications, with 57 (18%) receiving an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), 46 (14%) receiving an acei and a beta-blocker, and 38 (12%) receiving a beta-blocker. Of 163 breast cancer patients, 129 (79%) were able to complete targeted therapy with COC co-management. Most of the 779 patients (n = 643, 83%) were alive at the time of the last data collection. Conclusions This cohort study is one of the largest to report characteristics and clinical outcomes of patients referred to a coc. Collaboration between oncologists and cardiologists resulted in completion of cancer therapy in most patients. Ongoing analysis of referral patterns, management plans, and patient outcomes will help to guide the cardiac care of oncology patients, ultimately optimizing cancer and cardiac outcomes alike. ? 2019 Multimed Inc.",Cardiac outcomes; Cardio-oncology; Cardiotoxicity; LVEF; Targeted therapy,beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; doxorubicin; epirubicin; adult; aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cancer therapy; cardiac imaging; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; diastolic heart failure; digestive system cancer; echocardiography; female; heart death; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle failure; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; observational study; oncology; patient referral; pericardial effusion; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; urogenital tract cancer,2-s2.0-85069292206

In young pre-school children, there is uncertainty regarding which of the commonly used anthropometric measures of childhood obesity is best associated with cardiometabolic risk factors. This study compared the utility of common measures used in identifying obesity in these young children. Methods The four commonly used metrics for identifying obesity in children: body fat percentage 90th percentile, waist circumference 90th percentile, BMI z score &gt; 2 SD and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) 0.5, were measured in a cohort of children born singleton, at full term and followed from birth (n = 761) to 5 years of age (n = 513). The utility of each in identifying cardiometabolic risk factors (fasting lipid profile, fasting blood glucose and blood pressure) was examined. Results At age 5 years, children with percent body fat 90th percentile or waist circumference 90th percentile, were associated with higher levels of triglycerides, glucose, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures than those &lt; 90th percentile, respectively. Such differences were not obvious at age 3 years or at birth. A BMI z-score &gt; 2 SD was associated with higher levels of triglycerides and systolic and diastolic blood pressure but not glucose at age 5 years. Differences in HDL cholesterol, fasting glucose and systolic blood pressure were observed in children with BMI z score &gt; 2 SD at age 3 years but not with the other indices of obesity. As almost all children had WHtR 0.5 at birth, ages 1 and 3 years, this measure could not differentiate increased cardiometabolic risk. At age 5 years, the differences were much more obvious, with significant differences in triglycerides and systolic and diastolic blood pressures between those with WHtR 0.5 and those with &lt; 0.5. Conclusion Each of the four commonly used measures of childhood obesity shows moderate associations with cardiometabolic risk factors at 5 years, with no advantage of one measure over the other. These associations were less consistent at 3 years of age or younger. These observations have not been reported previously. ? 2019 Teo et al.

FCA approaches are attractive because, unlike other accessibility measures, they take into account the potential for congestion of facilities. This is done by 1) considering the population within the catchment area of a facility to calculate a variable that measures level of service, and then 2) aggregating the level of service by population centers subject to catchment area constraints. In this paper we discuss an effect of FCA approaches, an artifact that we term demand and level of service inflation. These artifacts are present in previous implementations of FCA methods. We argue that inflation makes interpretation of estimates of accessibility difficult, which has possible deleterious consequences for decision making. Next, we propose a simple and intuitive approach to proportionally allocate demandand and level of service in FCA calculations. The approach is based on a standardization of the impedance matrix, similar to approaches popular in the spatial statistics and econometrics literature. The result is a more intiuitive measure of accessibility that 1) provides a local version of the provider-to-population ratio; and 2) preserves the level of demand and the level of supply in a system. We illustrate the relevant issues with some examples, and then empirically by means of a case study of accessibility to family physicians in the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area (CMA), in Ontario, Canada. Results indicate that demand and supply inflation/deflation affect the interpretation of accessibility analysis using existing FCA methods, and that the proposed adjustment can lead to more intuitive results. ? 2019 Paez et al.

We included studies on the 2014 EVD outbreak alone, limited to those on human patients in Africa. We searched the following databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science) for outbreak reports published between 2014–2018. We assessed factors potentially associated with the quality of reporting. A total of 69 of 131 (53%) articles within the full-text review fulfilled our eligibility criteria and underwent the Modified STROBE assessment for analyzing the quality of reporting. The Modified STROBE scores of the included studies ranged from 11–26 points and the mean was found to be 19.54 out of 30 with a standard deviation (SD) of ± 4.30. The top three reported Modified STROBE components were descriptive characteristics of study participants, scientific background and evidence rational, and clinical significance of observations. More than 75% of the studies met a majority of the criteria in the Modified STROBE assessment tool. Information that was commonly missing included addressing potential source of bias, sensitivity analysis, further results/analysis such as risk estimates and odds ratios, presence of a flowchart, and addressing missing data. In multivariable analysis, peer-reviewed publication was the only predictor that remained significantly associated with a higher Modified STROBE score. In conclusion, the large range of Modified STROBE scores observed indicates variability in the quality of outbreak reports for EVD. The review identified strong reporting in some areas, whereas other areas are in need of improvement, in particular providing an important description of the outbreak setting and identifying any external elements (potential biases and confounding factors) that could hinder the credibility of the findings. ? 2019 Huynh et al.

Their prescribing practices can significantly affect the quantity of unconsumed opioids available to fuel the current opioid epidemic. The aim of this study was to identify prescribing patterns and knowledge gaps among orthopedic providers for targeted future interventions and investigation. Design: An online survey describing six common orthopedic surgical scenarios was distributed electronically to determine opioid type and quantity prescribed at discharge, medication disposal instructions, and the use of prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) in the prescription writing process. Setting: Tertiary care academic hospitals. Participants: Orthopedic physicians and mid-level providers practicing at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions and University of Maryland Medical System. Of 179 providers contacted, 127 (71 percent) completed the survey. Main outcome measures: Quantity of opioid prescribed, utilization of PDMPs, and provision of opioid disposal instructions. Results: While statistically significant associations were identified between quantity of opioid prescribed and surgical procedure, for five of six scenarios 95 percent of respondents recommended prescribing >55 oxycodone 5 mg pill equivalents (PEs) at discharge. An inverse correlation between years of clinical practice and mean number of PEs prescribed was observed. Fewer than 40 percent of respondents modified prescribing when presented with clinically relevant changes in scenario (history of depression or drug abuse). Over 60 percent of respondents do not use PDMPs, and 79 percent do not provide opioid disposal instructions.

In animal models, gestational exposure to inorganic arsenic has been associated with higher corticosterone concentration and consequent impairment of stress control in offspring. An equivalent association relating cortisol, a glucocorticoid hormone, in humans has not been previously studied. Objective. The aim of the study was to explore the association between prenatal inorganic arsenic exposure and salivary cortisol in infants from Arica, Chile. Materials and method. A cohort study of 168 mother-child dyads was recruited. In the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, urinary inorganic arsenic was assessed; 18–24 months after delivery, salivary cortisol was measured in the children. Maternal cortisol, maternal depression, stress, and socio-economic status were also evaluated. Results. The adjusted association was estimated with multiple linear regression after evaluating confounding through a directed acyclic graph. Median urinary inorganic arsenic in pregnant women was 14.1 ?g/L (IQR: 10.4–21.7) while salivary cortisol in the children was 0.17 ?g/L (IQR: 0.11–0.38). Among children from the highest income families (> 614 USD/month), arsenic exposure was associated with salivary cortisol. Children in the third quartile of arsenic exposure had-0.769 units of the logarithm of salivary cortiso, compared with those in the first quartile (p = 0.045). Conclusions. In this sample, prenatal exposure to arsenic was associated with salivary cortisol (third quartile of inorganic arsenic), only in infants belonging the highest income strata (> 614 USD). More studies are needed to confirm these preliminary results. ? 2019, Institute of Agricultural Medicine.

We recently completed a randomized controlled trial of a targeted knowledge translation (KT) intervention delivered through the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal with the goal to increase physical activity and physical mobility in middle-aged and older adults, with results reported elsewhere. Objective: The purpose of this process evaluation study is to explore which KT strategies were used by both intervention and control group participants, as well as the intervention groups’ engagement, satisfaction, and perceived usefulness of the targeted KT intervention. Methods: Data on engagement with the intervention materials were gathered quantitatively through Google Analytics and Hootsuite throughout the intervention. Qualitative data were collected through a combination of open-ended surveys and qualitative interviews with a subset of participants at the end of the study to further understand engagement, satisfaction, and usefulness of the KT strategies. Results: Throughout the intervention period, engagement with content delivered through weekly emails was highest, and participants rated email content most favorably in both surveys and interviews. Participants were generally satisfied with the intervention, noting the ease of participating and the distillation of information in an easy-to-access format being beneficial features. Participants who did not find the intervention useful were those with already high levels of baseline physical activity or physical function and those who were looking for more specific or individualized content. Conclusions: This process evaluation provides insight into our randomized controlled trial findings and provides information that can be used to improve future online KT interventions. ?Sarah E Neil-Sztramko, Jenna Smith-Turchyn, Julie Richardson, Maureen Dobbins.",Health information; Knowledge translation; Mobility; Older adults; Physical activity; Process evaluation,aged; article; controlled study; distillation; e-mail; evaluation study; female; human; interview; male; medical information; physical activity; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial; satisfaction,2-s2.0-85068493280

Therefore, this study investigated radiation dose to patients from six cardiac catheterization procedures at our facility and suggest possible initial dose values for benchmark for patient radiation dose from these procedures. This initial benchmark data will be used for clinical radiation dose management which is essential for assessing the impact of any quality improvement initiatives in the cardiac catheterization laboratory. Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the dose parameters of 1000 patients who underwent various cardiac catheterization procedures: Left heart catheterization (LH), percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), complex PCI, LH with complex PCI, LH with PCI and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacemaker in our cardiac catheterization laboratories. Patient's clinical radiation dose data [kerma-area-product (KAP) and air-kerma at the interventional reference point (Ka,r)] and technique parameters (fluoroscopy time, tube potential, current, pulse width and number cine images) along with demographic information (age, height and weight) were collected from the hospital's RIS (Synapse), Sensis/Syngo Dynamics and Siemens Sensis Stats Manager electronic database. Statistical analysis was performed with the IBM SPSS Modeler v. 18.1 software. Results: The overall patient median age was 67.0 (range: 26.0-97.0) years and the median body mass index (BMI) was 28.8 (range: 15.9-61.7) kg/m2 . The median KAP for the LH, PCI, LH with complex PCI, complex PCI, LH with PCI and CRT-pacemaker procedures are 44.4 (4.1-203.2), 80.2 (18.9-208.5), 83.7 (48.0-246.1), 113.8 (60.9-284.5), 91.7 (6.0-426.0) and 51.1 (7.0-175.9) Gy-cm2 . The median Ka,r for the LH, PCI, LH with complex PCI, complex PCI, LH with PCI and CRT-pacemaker procedures are 701.0 (35.3-3794.0), 1384.7 (291.7-4021.8), 1607.0 (883.5- 4448.3), 2260.2 (867.4-5311.9), 1589.3 (100.2-7237.4) and 463.8 (67.7-1695.9) mGy respectively. Conclusion: We have analyzed patient radiation doses from six commonly used procedures in our cardiac catheterization laboratories and suggested possible initial values for benchmark from these procedures for the fluoroscopy time, KAP and air-kerma at the interventional reference point based on our current practices. Our data compare well with published values reported in the literature by investigators who have also studied patient doses and established benchmark dose levels for their facilities. Procedure-specific benchmark dose data for various groups of patients can provide the motivation for monitoring practices to promote improvements in patient radiation dose optimization in the cardiac catheterization laboratories. Advances in knowledge: We have investigated local patients' radiation doses and established benchmark radiation data which are essential for assessing the impact of any quality improvement initiatives for radiation dose optimization. ? 2019 The Authors.",,"adult; aged; Article; body mass; cardiac resynchronization therapy; fluoroscopy; heart catheterization; human; major clinical study; percutaneous coronary intervention; radiation dose; radiation dose reduction; radiation exposure; radiation protection; radiation response; radiation safety; retrospective study; total quality management; female; heart catheterization; interventional radiology; male; middle aged; procedures; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cardiac Catheterization; Female; Fluoroscopy; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Radiation Dosage; Radiography, Interventional; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-85068488315

In this study, we examined the roles of age and gender in moderating the relation between self-reported cultural identity and externalizing and internalizing problems and the interaction between Indigenous and Mainstream cultural identity in relation to problematic behaviors. The participants included 61 students (32 female) with a mean age of 14.5 years (SD = 1.69) from a Naskapi reserve in Quebec, Canada. Age moderated the relation between identification with Indigenous culture and internalizing symptomatology. Indigenous and Mainstream cultural identity did not interact in predicting internalizing or externalizing problems. Consistent with the available evidence regarding the centrality of identity in adolescent development, the magnitude of the inverse relation between identification with Indigenous culture and number of clinical internalizing symptoms appears to increase in significance later in adolescence. The lack of an interaction between Indigenous and Mainstream cultural identity in relation to internalizing and externalizing problems suggests that it is the need to consider both cultures individually without the assumption that one negates the other. ?

Presence of a mental health disorder was also explored as a potential mediating variable in these associations. The weighted sample included 23,846 adult participants from the 2012 Canadian Community Health Survey–Mental Health. Logistic and multinomial regression analyses examined associations among individual and multiple exposures to subtypes of childhood maltreatment with police contact. The Sobel test was used to assess the mediating effect of mental health disorders. Adjusting for sociodemographic variables, results indicated that all maltreatment subtypes were significantly associated with increased odds of both forms of police contact (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 2.06 to 2.95). Presence of a mental health disorder was a partial mediator in the associations between child maltreatment and both forms of adult police contact (adjusted odds ratios ranged from 1.52 to 2.32). In addition, a dose–response relationship was observed for victimization; as the number of subtypes of maltreatment increased, there was an incremental increase in risk of victimization. Future efforts are needed to prioritize child maltreatment prevention, trauma-informed approaches, mental health awareness, and training in law enforcement. ?

Evidence about the clinical and economic value enabled through the use of eReferral systems is limited. Our objective was to review the evidence base for the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of eReferral systems. This review is part of a bigger project to inform the economic benefits of a regional eReferral implementation program. Material and methods: A systematic search was conducted to capture the available literature on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of eReferral system interventions. Evaluation of eReferral system for cost or outcome(s) were included. Strictly e-consultation systems were excluded. We only included publications in English. Results: We found 274 citations. After removing duplicates and conducting levels one and two screenings, nine publications qualified. Results were divided into four categories: Cost or cost-effectiveness analysis, changes in workflow efficiency, the quantity of referrals, and the quality of referrals. A full economic evaluation, conducted in Denmark, found that an eReferral system was cost-effective compared with a paper-based referral system. Of the other eight studies, three demonstrated positive changes in referral processing; two evaluated changes in the quality of the referrals, and three evaluated if the eReferral system increased the quantity of referrals. Discussion: The evidence base on the effectiveness of eReferral systems to improve communication between primary care and specialists and to decrease wait times is positive but limited. Economic evaluations are needed to examine the clinical and economic value of eReferral systems in health care. ? 2019 Azamar-Alonso et al.",Cost-effectiveness; Costs; EHealth systems; Electronic referrals; Review,article; cost effectiveness analysis; Denmark; human; outcome assessment; patient referral; primary medical care; publication; systematic review; telehealth; workflow,2-s2.0-85067584362

We aimed to explore clinical and biochemical factors, including the achievement of American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommended targets associated with DKD in people living with T1D for ?50?years. Methods: This was a post hoc analysis of a cross-sectional study of 75 participants enrolled in the Canadian Study of Longevity in T1D. We explored diabetes-related complications, including neuropathy, retinopathy, cardiovascular disease, and DKD. Study participants were dichotomized based on the achievement of ADA recommended targets as the low-target group (achieving ?4 targets, n = 31) and high-target group (achieving &gt;4 targets, n = 44). The outcome of interest was DKD defined by estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values &lt;60/mL/min/1.73?m2 and/or 24-h albumin excretion &gt;30 mg. Multivariable logistic regression models were employed to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for DKD with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Of the 75 participants with prolonged T1D duration (45% male, mean age 66?years), 25 participants had DKD and 50 did not. There was no statistical difference between the high- and low-target groups in terms of age and body mass index. eGFR was significantly higher and the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy was significantly lower in the high-target group. Older age at diagnosis of T1D and lower frequency component to high-frequency component ratio increased the odds of having DKD. Conclusions: In adults with prolonged T1D duration, older age at diagnosis and lower heart rate variability may be associated with DKD. ? 2019, ? 2019 The Author(s).

However, most conventional therapies still lack cancer selectivity, which can have severe unintended side effects on healthy body tissue. Despite being an unconventional and contentious therapy, the last two decades have seen a significant renaissance of bacterium-mediated cancer therapy (BMCT). Although promising, most present-day therapeutic bacterial candidates have not shown satisfactory efficacy, effectiveness, or safety. Furthermore, therapeutic bacterial candidates are available to only a few of the approximately 200 existing cancer types. Excitingly, the recent surge in BMCT has piqued the interest of non-BMCT microbiologists. To help advance these interests, in this paper we reviewed important aspects of cancer, present-day cancer treatments, and historical aspects of BMCT. Here, we provided a four-step framework that can be used in screening and identifying bacteria with cancer therapeutic potential, including those that are uncultivable. Systematic methodologies such as the ones suggested here could prove valuable to new BMCT researchers, including experienced non-BMCT researchers in possession of extensive knowledge and resources of bacterial genomics. Lastly, our analyses highlight the need to establish and standardize quantitative methods that can be used to identify and compare bacteria with important cancer therapeutic traits. ?

Methods: We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews. We recruited adults with HIV from a hospital clinic and community-based organization in Dublin, Ireland. We asked participants to describe their health-related challenges, the extent to which these challenges were episodic in nature, and the impact on their overall health. We analyzed data using content analytical techniques. Results: Of the 12 participants (9 men; 3 women), with a median time since HIV diagnosis of 12 years, 83% had an undetectable viral load. Participants described multi-dimensional and episodic health challenges that spanned disability dimensions in the Episodic Disability Framework including: physical, cognitive, and mental-emotional symptoms and impairments, challenges to social inclusion, and uncertainty or worrying about future health with HIV. Contextual factors that exacerbated disability included stigma and fear of HIV disclosure whereas living strategies (lifestyle, positive outlook, resiliency) and social support (family, friends, health services and providers) mitigated disability. Conclusions: The Episodic Disability Framework is pertinent to adults living with HIV in Ireland. Contextual factors are critical for understanding cross-cultural distinctions of the disability experience across varying political, economic, socio-cultural, and environmental contexts and should be considered by rehabilitation professionals to address disability for people with HIV.Implications for rehabilitation The Episodic Disability Framework, originally derived and validated from perspectives of adults living with HIV in Canada, is pertinent to people living with HIV in Ireland. The Episodic Disability Framework can be used to describe disability experienced by people living with HIV, and to better understand the contextual factors that may exacerbate or alleviate dimensions of disability over time.

Methods: Starting in 2012, the 14 regional cancer centres overseen by Cancer Care Ontario in the province of Ontario, Canada began to screen ambulatory cancer patients for their smoking status, to provide smokers with advice on the health benefits of quitting and to offer referral to smoking cessation services. Multiple initiatives were undertaken to educate healthcare providers and patients on the health benefits of cessation. Critical to the success of the initiative was strong leadership from Cancer Care Ontario executives and regional vice presidents, advice from an advisory committee of smoking cessation experts, engagement of regional champions and support from a provincial secretariat. The quarterly review of performance metrics was an important driver of change. Results: Most cancer centres now screen in excess of 75% of ambulatory patients but rates for the acceptance of a referral to smoking cessation services remain low (less than 25%). Introduction of an opt-out referral process appears to increase referral acceptance. Economic analyses suggest that smoking cessation is cost-effective in a cancer centre environment. Conclusions: Although there are barriers to the implementation of smoking cessation in cancer centres, it is possible to change the culture to one in which smoking cessation is considered part of high-quality treatment. ?

Radiation-induced xerostomia is a common sequela of these treatments. The modified submandibular gland transfer (M-SGT) procedure was developed to decrease xerostomia in the treatment of oral cavity cancer by sparing one submandibular gland (SMG) from radiation. This study's objectives were to: 1) elucidate the radiation-sparing capacity of the M-SGT, and 2) study the xerostomia-reducing potential of the M-SGT based on the University of Washington Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (UW-QOL). Methods: Radiation therapy treatment plans were reviewed for all patients treated with surgery and RT who had a M-SGT at the University of Alberta Hospital during the study period. Outcomes included: 1) radiation dose received by the transferred SMG within the periparotid area compared to the submandibular triangle (ST), and 2) patient-reported saliva scores on the UW-QOL compared to historical controls without a gland transfer. Results: Twenty-two patients were included. The mean radiation dose received by the transferred SMG was 29.00 grays (Gy) (standard deviation 14.59 Gy), thus reducing the mean radiation dose to the SMG by a statistically significant 18.34 Gy (confidence interval 95% (13.37, 23.32), P < 0.01) compared to the ST and below the D50 of the SMG (34 Gy).

The diagnosis depends on clinical examination and proper imaging that should be able to identify abnormal and sometimes subtle morphological changes. Labral tears and cartilage lesions rarely occur without underlying bone abnormalities. Surgical approaches to treat FAI are increasing significantly worldwide, even without a clearly defined consensus of what should be accepted as the standard imaging diagnosis for FAI morphology. Hip abnormalities encompass many variations related to the shape, size, and spatial orientation of both sides of the joint and can be difficult to characterize if adequate imaging is not available.

Study Design Patients with body mass index (BMI) of either ? 18 ? 24.9 kg/m 2 (nonobese) or ? 30 kg/m 2 (obese) undergoing elective induction of labor were included (N = 25 each). Blood samples were collected at baseline (T 0), and 20 minutes after maximal OXT augmentation or adequate uterine contractions (T 1) for OXT and oxytocinase assays. A mixed-model repeated-measures analysis of variance was used to test for group versus time interaction and analysis of covariance to detect a difference in OXT level at T 1.

Results The mean BMIs (kg/m 2) were 22.1 ± 1.6 and 35.9 ± 5.1 in the nonobese and obese groups, respectively. No differences were observed in either the duration of OXT infusion, total dose of OXT, or plasma OXT (pg/mL) either at T 0 or T 1.

As a sub-study of the Canadian growth-hormone trial, parent-, and patient-completed standardized questionnaires were used to compare 70 girls with TS who received injections (GH group) and 61 similarly followed untreated TS controls (C) on multiple facets of psychosocial functioning. Questionnaires were given (i) at baseline (session 1, mean age = 10.4 y), (ii) before estrogen therapy for puberty induction (session 2, mean age = 13.0 y), (iii) after 1 year of estrogen therapy (session 3, mean age = 14.4 y), and (iv) when growth stopped (session 4, mean age = 16.3 y). Groups were compared for multiple facets of psychosocial function within social, behavioral, self-esteem, and academic domains. Results were also correlated with indices of adult height. We found no global (i.e., across-session) group differences on any scales or subscales of the four domains. In both GH and C groups, age-related improvements were seen for social problems, externalizing behavior problems, and school functioning and age-related declines for social competence and social relations. Both parents and patients claimed GH received less teasing than C but C had more friends than GH. Results from analyses conducted within individual sessions showed that while GH at early sessions claimed to be more popular, more socially engaged, better adapted, and to have higher self-esteem than C, C was reported to be less anxious, depressed, and withdrawn than GH at adult height. The correlation analyses revealed different effects of adult height and height gain on outcome for the two groups. In GH, both height parameters were correlated with multiple parent- and/or self-reported indices from the four psychosocial domains, whereas in C, only adult height and two indices (viz., total self-concept and school functioning), were correlated. The observed modest gains in psychosocial functioning for patients with TS treated with GH highlight the need for alternative approaches to assist them in coping with the challenges of their condition.

This study examined the association between physical activity, SB, and CRP in stroke. CRP data from 185 stroke survivors (Mage = 65 years) from the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey 2009–2010 were analyzed using weighted regression analysis. There was an interaction between physical activity and SB on CRP (estimated-β = ?0.079, 95% confidence interval [?0.14, ?0.02], p = .011).

Paramount to the care of affected patients is the delivery of lung-protective mechanical ventilation which prioritizes tidal volume and plateau pressure limitation. Lung protection can probably be further enhanced by scaling target tidal volumes to the specific respiratory mechanics of individual patients. The best procedure for selecting optimal positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) in ARDS remains uncertain; several relevant issues must be considered when selecting PEEP, particularly lung recruitability. Noninvasive ventilation must be used with caution in ARDS as excessively high respiratory drive can further exacerbate lung injury; newer modes of delivery offer promising approaches in hypoxemic respiratory failure. Airway pressure release ventilation offers an alternative approach to maximize lung recruitment and oxygenation, but clinical trials have not demonstrated a survival benefit of this mode over conventional ventilation strategies. Rescue therapy with high-frequency oscillatory ventilation is an important option in refractory hypoxemia. Despite a disappointing lack of benefit (and possible harm) in patients with moderate or severe ARDS, possibly due to lung hyperdistention and right ventricular dysfunction, high-frequency oscillation may improve outcome in patients with very severe hypoxemia. ? 2019 Georg Thieme.All rights reserved.",acute respiratory distress syndrome; high-frequency oscillation; mechanical ventilation; noninvasive ventilation; oxygen; positive end-expiratory pressure,adult respiratory distress syndrome; airway pressure; Article; artificial ventilation; clinical feature; expiratory flow; extracorporeal oxygenation; functional residual capacity; gas exchange; heart left ventricle function; heart output; heart ventricle function; high frequency oscillation; human; mortality rate; noninvasive ventilation; oxygenation; patient safety; positive end expiratory pressure; priority journal; respiratory drive; tidal volume; ventilator induced lung injury,2-s2.0-85065605119

Despite this, persons in prison experience barriers to care and face unique health challenges. Given the ways in which prisons shape health outcomes for incarcerated persons, it is important to interrogate how the provision of health care is governed in custodial settings. In this article, we examine one important aspect of governance: legislation governing the provision of health care in prisons. We view this issue through a critical lens, building on a body of poststructural scholarship which has illuminated how laws and policies are not merely tools of governance but also key sites for the production of meanings around social “problems,” including the “problem of health.” Taking Canada’s Corrections and Conditional Release Act as a case example and applying Carol Bacchi’s “What’s the Problem Represented to Be” analytical framework, we examine how the specific representation of “health” in this legislation works to produce effects for persons in federal prison. Three key themes are formed through this analysis. First, what constitutes “essential services” in the context of federal prisons is more limited compared with the broader community. Second, the dichotomy between the rights of persons in prison versus the protection of society that is produced in development of these laws has significant bearing on the treatment of those in prison. Third, this representation has negative effects on the health of persons in prison. In order to meet United Nations standards, greater attention must be paid to the ways in which laws and other governing practices reproduce inequities in health care provision in prisons. ?

Methods A cross-sectional survey of 334 employers with ?20 employees in 18 economic sectors in the Ontario economy. Participants provided information on five dimensions of OHS expenditures: (i) organizational management and supervision; (ii) staff training in health and safety; (iii) personal protective equipment; (iv) professional services and, (v) estimates of the share of new capital investment that could be attributed to improved OHS performance. Expenditures for each of the five dimensions were summed for each organization and divided by the number of employees, resulting in an estimate of OHS expenditure per employee per year. Results The average OHS expenditure per worker per year was Can$1303 [95% confidence interval (CI) Can$1167-1454]. Expenditures were three times higher in the goods-producing sectors (Can$2417, 95% CI Can$2026-2809) relative to the service sectors (Can$847, 95% CI Can$777-915). The proportion of expenditures allocated to each of the five dimensions was generally consistent across economic sectors: 58% to organizational management and supervision, 22% to staff training in health and safety and 14% to personal protective equipment. On average, <5% of OHS expenditures per worker per year were allocated to professional services or estimated as the share of new capital investment attributed to OHS. Conclusions Employer expenditures on OHS are substantial.

The polymer is a combination of hydrophobic N-isopropyl acrylamide (NIPAM), hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) and acrylic acid (AA), and a monomer containing a hydrolysable lactone ring. Poly(NIPAM) has unique thermal properties, giving our polymer combination a lower critical solution temperature near the body’s temperature of 37?C. Practically, this means our polymer is a liquid at room temperature, allowing for easy injection into the eye, and will self-assemble into a gel at body temperature in an aqueous environment, such as the vitreous space. While poly(NIPAM) is typically opaque upon gelation, our formulation including hydrophilic PEG allows the material to maintain transparency. This would allow patients to see through the material, a feature not currently available with existing vitreous tamponades. allowing them to resume normal activities shortly after surgery instead of potentially weeks of downtime. Additionally, the lactone ring incorporated into the polymer backbone aids in polymer degradation over time, allowing the gel to be naturally cleared by the eye over many months. Patients could then be treated with a single surgery, instead of the multiple surgeries currently required to place then subsequently remove the tamponade material. Furthermore, as our material has a tailorable density, the gel formulation would not require patients to be “positioned” to increase the likelihood of a successful procedure. While this is a helpful for all patients, it is especially advantageous to those with inferior retinal tears or pediatric patients. Since this material is a gel, there would also be no limitations to air travel, which again would minimize the disruption to the patient and reduce the economic costs associated with these conditions. To date, we have tested this material in animals and it shows no toxicity to the ocular tissues, allowing it to remain in the eye for many months; some current products must be removed after a few weeks due to toxicity issues. ? 2019 Omnipress - All rights reserved.",,Acrylic monomers; Amides; Esters; Gelation; Hydrophilicity; Ophthalmology; Patents and inventions; Polyethylenes; Toxicity; Aqueous environment; Lower critical solution temperature; N-isopropylacrylamides; Pediatric patients; Poly-n-isopropyl acrylamide; Polymer degradation; Retinal detachments; Vitreous substitute; Surgery,2-s2.0-85065419718

Traumatic brain injury sustained during adolescence can result in cognitive and social communication impairments that compromise the development and maintenance of intimate social relationships. This can increase both short and long-term vulnerability to poor mental health, social isolation, lack of meaningful friendships, exploitation, and abuse. Females with traumatic brain injury experience greater loss of confidence and have increased risk of victimization, sexual abuse, and violence. This paper aims to provide a framework to inform gender specific rehabilitation of social communication and intimacy, to enhance positive social outcomes for girls and women with Traumatic Brain Injury. Methods: The framework is developed through presentation of a conceptual, multi-dimensional model of intimacy and discussion of current evidence regarding trauma-related cognitive/social-communication impairments and considerations regarding social media. Results: Intimacy is strongly influenced by today’s technology-informed “youth culture” and for those with Traumatic Brain Injury, is impacted by cognitive and social communication impairments. Females experience different challenges in recovery and experience of intimacy. There is a need to support girls and women with Traumatic Brain Injury as they develop intimate relationships. Conclusions: This framework can guide the development of female gender-specific rehabilitation and inform future research to promote positive social outcomes.Implications for rehabilitation Intimate relationships are a critical component of mental health and an important part of human development; however, the challenges faced by adolescent girls and woman with TBI in developing and maintaining intimate relationships are often overlooked in traditional rehabilitation programs. A multi-dimensional model of intimacy will help rehabilitation professionals understand the complexities of interventions needed to support healthy intimacy, as well as for harm prevention. Rehabilitation professionals play an important role in advocating for gender-specific supports and interventions. There is a need for early interventions, grounded in today’s technological and social media culture, that will support healthy intimacy for adolescent girls and women with TBI. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",cognitive-communication; females; Intimacy; social communication; traumatic brain injury,,2-s2.0-85064712839

This transformation carries an enormous potential to improve mental health care and patient assessment. However, it is not only data gathering that is increasing at a high velocity, but also relevant ethical issues derived from its ownership, analysis, and impact in our lives. In this chapter, we review potential applications of big data analytics and associated dilemmas that may arise from it. We start by discussing issues linked to data itself, involving ownership, privacy, transparency, and reliability. Then, we proceed to discuss what may happen following data processing, and the implementation of predictive models = in real scenarios, focusing on the implications for clinicians, scientists, and patients. We highlight that while it is necessary to develop more strict regulations for handling sensitive data, we must also pay attention to the problem of overregulation, which could create unnecessary obstacles for data science and slow down the potential benefits it may have in our society. ?

Mental disorders represent a public health challenge of staggering proportions. According to the most recent Global Burden of Disease study, psychiatric disorders constitute the leading cause of years lost to disability. The high morbidity and mortality related to these conditions are proportional to the potential for overall health gains if mental disorders can be more effectively diagnosed and treated. In order to fill these gaps, analysis in science, industry, and government seeks to use big data for a variety of problems, including clinical outcomes and diagnosis in psychiatry. Multiple mental healthcare providers and research laboratories are increasingly using large data sets to fulfill their mission. Briefly, big data is characterized by high volume, high velocity, variety and veracity of information, and to be useful it must be analyzed, interpreted, and acted upon. As such, focus has to shift to new analytical tools from the field of machine learning that will be critical for anyone practicing medicine, psychiatry and behavioral sciences in the 21st century. Big data analytics is gaining traction in psychiatric research, being used to provide predictive models for both clinical practice and public health systems. As compared with traditional statistical methods that provide primarily average group-level results, big data analytics allows predictions and stratification of clinical outcomes at an individual subject level. Personalized Psychiatry – Big Data Analytics in Mental Health provides a unique opportunity to showcase innovative solutions tackling complex problems in mental health using big data and machine learning. It represents an interesting platform to work with key opinion leaders to document current achievements, introduce new concepts as well as project the future role of big data and machine learning in mental health. ?

Three functional units were considered: volume, binder intensity with compressive strength as a performance indicator (BI-CS), and binder intensity with time to first repair (TFR) as the performance indicator (BI-TFR).To consider the effect of cement replacement, four mix designs with varying levels of cement replacement by fly ash (0%, 25%, 35%, and 50%) were compared using a cradle to grave comparative LCA analysis. A number of key outcomes were identified in the analysis. Firstly, when volume is used as the functional unit, the LCA results depend on the level of cement replacement and the cement content of the mix such that the higher the level of replacement, the lower the LCA results. Secondly, the LCA results were influenced by the level of cement replacement when BI-CS is used as the functional unit in that the higher the level of replacement, the lower the LCA results except for ecotoxicity and human toxicity non-cancer impact categories due to the increase in transportation flows. Finally the LCA results were influenced by the TFR of the concrete mix when BI-TFR was used as the functional unit revealing that the higher the TFR, the lower the LCA results. The choice of functional units can influence the results of a comparative LCA to the point that it changes the order of preference of concrete mix designs. ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,Benchmarking; Binders; Cements; Compressive strength; Concrete mixers; Concretes; Ecodesign; Fly ash; Binder intensities; Cement content; Cement replacement; Comparative life cycle assessment; Concrete mix design; Functional units; Performance indicators; Transportation flow; Life cycle,2-s2.0-85063938659

Results: PD Indians did not differ from PD Caucasians on anxiety or depression. However, PD Caucasians were more likely to report aching pain by 80 times and dull pain by 108 times compared to PD Indians. PD Indians were 82% less likely to have pain interfering with social activities, and 90% less likely to have pain interfering with relations with others compared to PD Caucasians.

Results reveal that absence mitigates the impact of emotional exhaustion on diminished personal accomplishment among fixed shift nurses who work in the least stressful units. Absence buffers the impact of emotional exhaustion on diminished personal accomplishment in understaffed units. Its role changes when it comes to buffering the impact of emotional exhaustion on depersonalisation across levels of understaffing. We argue that absence plays an attenuating role only when specific contextual factors cohere. Nurses who are aware of this contextual confluence manage their mental health better.

Accurately measuring helmet use is important for the evaluation of new legislation and enforcement. Current methods for estimating helmet use involve roadside observation or surveillance of police and hospital records, both of which are time-Consuming and costly. Our objective was to develop a novel method of estimating motorcycle helmet use. Methods: Using Google Maps, 3000 intersections in Bangkok were selected at random. At each intersection, hyperlinks of four images 90° apart were extracted. These 12 000 images were processed in Amazon Mechanical Turk using crowdsourcing to identify images containing motorcycles. The remaining images were sorted manually to determine helmet use. Results: After processing, 462 unique motorcycle drivers were analysed. The overall helmet wearing rate was 66.7 % (95% CI 62.6 % to 71.0 %). Taxi drivers had higher helmet use, 88.4% (95% CI 78.4% to 94.9%), compared with non-Taxi drivers, 62.8% (95% CI 57.9% to 67.6%). Helmet use on non-Residential roads, 85.2% (95% CI 78.1 % to 90.7%), was higher compared with residential roads, 58.5% (95% CI 52.8% to 64.1%). Using logistic regression, the odds of a taxi driver wearing a helmet compared with a non-Taxi driver was significantly increased 1.490 (p<0.01). The odds of helmet use on non-Residential roads as compared with residential roads was also increased at 1.389 (p<0.01). Conclusion: This novel method of estimating helmet use has produced results similar to traditional methods. Applying this technology can reduce time and monetary costs and could be used anywhere street imagery is used. Future directions include automating this process through machine learning. ?

As even mild wrTBI can result in cognitive, behavioural, and functional impairments that can last for months and even years, injury prevention is a primary research focus. Administrative claims data have provided valuable insights into the mechanisms that cause wrTBI; however, data from the perspective of injured workers on wrTBI prevention is limited. OBJECTIVE: Our study aimed to better understand the factors that precipitate wrTBI, as perceived by injured workers. METHODS: We recruited 101 injured workers from a neurology services clinic with a province-wide catchment area in a large, urban teaching hospital and studied perceived preventability of these injuries from the injured workers' perspective. RESULTS: Key findings were that nearly 80% of injuries were perceived as preventable, and nearly 25% and 50% of workers reported that they did not receive job and health and safety training, respectively. Less than half of all workers reported being regularly supervised, and of those who were supervised, approximately two-thirds reported that supervision was adequate. Moreover, 84% and 77% reported they were advised to rest and take time-off after the injury, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to show that the vast majority of injured workers consider their wrTBI to be preventable. In addition, we found that training and supervision are two areas that can be targeted by wrTBI prevention strategies. Our study provides valuable and unique perspectives to consider when designing wrTBI prevention initiatives. ? 2019 - IOS Press and the authors.

Using the latest theory and evidence in medical education, we created an interprofessional, entirely in-situ, simulation-based small-group activity. The activity was then piloted for four months with the goals of assessing perceived usefulness, as well as implementation factors such as participant accessibility and overall resource requirements. A total of 37 interprofessional (physician and nursing) staff were trained in 16 small group sessions over four months. Post-participation questionnaires revealed that the activity was perceived to be highly useful for their practice; especially the rapid cycle deliberate practice instructional method, and the increased focus on crisis resource management.

Canadians report that they wait longer for specialists than citizens in other countries. The main reason for this is that the referral process is poorly coordinated and leads to delays in care. Electronic referral (eReferral) is seen as a potential means of improving the referral process and enabling faster access to care. There is the potential for national implementation of eReferral in Canada to help achieve this aim. However, existing initiatives have encountered challenges with user adoption and users have continued to use fax. A validated tool was used to survey both users of fax as well as users of eReferral. These two groups of users were then compared. Most family physicians using fax were satisfied overall with the process. This highlighted how challenging any change of this engrained technology will be. There were, however, some significant areas were eReferral was superior to fax. This included response time, the overall quality of referral information, completeness of the information, the timeliness of the information, and the format and layout. There is an opportunity to leverage these findings to support the adoption of eReferral and help reduce wait times. ? 2019 American Psychological Association Inc.

Our objective was to assess whether child psychiatric symptoms from 6 to 10 years of age mediate the association between exposure to maternal depressive symptoms in childhood and offspring SRT and SA in adolescence.MethodsA population-based cohort study was constructed by linking all eight cycles from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (NLSCY), a nationally representative Canadian panel survey conducted from 1994 to 2009. Self-reported maternal depressive symptoms were measured when offspring were between 0 and 5 years. Maternal-reported child psychiatric symptoms and psychiatric comorbid symptoms were measured from 6 to 10 years, and offspring self-reported SRT and SA were measured between 11 and 19 years. Indirect effects, the effect proportion mediated and their corresponding bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated.ResultsHyperactivity and inattention significantly mediated the association between maternal depressive symptoms in childhood and risk of both SRT and SA from 11 to 19 years, where approximately 60% (SRT 95% CI 23-94%; SA 95% CI 27-95%) of this association was explained by hyperactivity and inattention. Psychiatric comorbid symptoms also significantly mediated this relationship and accounted for 50% (95% CI 18-81%) of this association with SA.ConclusionsTargeting hyperactivity and inattention, and co-occurring psychiatric symptoms in offspring of depressed mothers could reduce risk of SRT, eventual SA and halt progression towards suicide. However, further understanding of comorbid psychiatric symptoms in childhood that most strongly predict adolescent SA is needed. ? 2019 Cambridge University Press.",Adolescents; child psychiatry; mediation; prospective study; suicide,,2-s2.0-85061078411

Addressing social determinants of health is paramount to successful progression along the HIV-care continuum. Canada is a bilingual country with French and English as official languages. There are few studies to date that have focused on the impact of being a French-speaking linguistic minority on the HIV-care continuum. The primary objective of this scoping, systematic review of literature is to evaluate existing gaps in access to HIV- care among French-speaking people living with HIV in Canada. Our primary outcome is healthcare services availability and access for French- speaking people living with HIV. Methods and analyses Our scoping, systematic review will draw on a systematic search of published literature, both quantitative and qualitative studies published on French-speaking individuals' healthcare and HIV status in Canada, with particular emphasis on the province of Ontario. We will conduct our search in MEDLINE, the Excerpta Medica Database, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Web of Science, EBSCO and Google Scholar for work published between 1990 and 2018. Identified articles will be screened in duplicate and full-text articles of relevant studies will be retrieved. Data will also be extracted by two researchers working independently. Any discrepancies that arise will be resolved by consensus or by consulting a third author. Our findings will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Ethics and dissemination Our proposed research will not be conducted with human participants. We will only use secondary published data and therefore ethics approval is not required. Our findings will be disseminated as peer reviewed manuscripts at conferences and student rounds, and could be of interest to government health agencies and local HIV/AIDS service organisations. ?

Design Systematic review without meta-analysis. Methods We systematically searched MEDLINE and all relevant guideline websites (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, National Guideline Clearinghouse, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network, WHO, Guidelines International Network, DynaMed, UpTodate, Best Practice) from their inception to January 2017 to identify and select gout CPGs. We used search terms such as gout', 'hyperuricemia' and 'guideline'. We included the eligible CPGs of gout according to the predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria after screening titles, abstracts and full texts. The characteristics of recommendations reported in the included guidelines were extracted and analysed. Results A total of 15 gout guidelines with a range of 5-80 recommendations were retrieved. Several indicators were used in the gout guidelines to facilitate identification of recommendations, including grouping all recommendations in a summary section, formatting recommendations in a particular or special way, using locating words for recommendations and indicating the strength of recommendation and quality of evidence. We found some components commonly used in the recommendations. The wording of recommendations varied across guidelines. Recommendations were detailed and explained in the section of rationale and explanation of recommendations. In some guidelines, recommendations were accompanied with other material to assist their reporting. Conclusions Variability and inconsistency were found on the reporting and presentation of recommendations in gout guidelines. Several points for reporting recommendation can be summarised. First, we suggested summarising and highlighting the core recommendations in a guideline. Second, guideline developers should try to structure and write recommendations reasonably. Third, it was necessary to detail and explain the recommendations and their rationale. Finally, describing and providing other potential useful contents was also a helpful way for clear reporting. ?

Our understanding of sleep following concussion is less well understood within a pediatric population. In this study, we investigated the trajectory of sleep and daytime sleepiness in a prospective cohort of 40 children and youth (6–18 years old) with concussion, 40 age-and sex-matched healthy children and youth, and 40 with upper-extremity orthopedic injury. Evaluations occurred during the acute stage (<2 weeks) and at 3-, 6-, and 12-month postinjury using the Sleep Disturbance Scale for Children and the Postconcussion Symptom Scale. There were no significant differences within- or between-group differences in sleep across all four time points with analysis of the groups as a whole. When groups were divided by age (6–11 and 12– < 18 years), there was a significant difference in the ability to initiate sleep for the younger concussed group during the acute stage, compared with healthy controls, as well as significantly greater daytime nap duration that decreased over time. Significant correlations were also found between the frequency and duration of daytime naps and Postconcussion Symptom Scale total score and subscores (cognitive, physical/migraine, mood, and sleep) in the concussed group during the acute stage. Our results suggest that in a group with noncomplicated concussion, children and youth have transient alterations in daytime sleepiness that are related to concussion symptoms. Younger children may be more vulnerable to disturbances in sleep and daytime wakefulness. ?

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the utility of the Canadian immigration medical examination and TB Medical Surveillance (TBMS) for detecting paediatric TB disease. DESIGN: A 10-year population-based retrospective cohort study of foreign-born children (ages 0–10 years) and adolescents (ages 11–17 years) immigrating to Ontario, Canada, using linked immigration and public health databases. RESULTS: Among 232 169 individuals (median followup of 5.7 years), active TB was diagnosed at or after immigration in 125 cases (20 children and 105 adolescents), at an overall rate of 54/100 000 (14/100 000 children, 116/100 000 adolescents). All cases originated from 34 countries. Active TB was diagnosed in 0/419 children and 10/418 adolescents referred for medical surveillance, representing only 8.0% of all cases. TBMS referrals were correlated with a previous diagnosis of TB (? = 0.8) and were driven by country of origin (e.g., hazard ratio 31.2 for the Philippines). Rates of pre-immigration TB diagnosis varied considerably among high TB burden countries. CONCLUSIONS: The current Canadian system detects little TB disease, and reveals very different rates of pre-immigration paediatric TB diagnosis in different high TB burden countries. These data provide a basis for improving TB screening strategies for immigrants to low TB burden countries. ? 2019 The Union.",Infectious diseases; Migrant; Paediatric; Screening,"Article; Bangladesh; Canadian; child; cohort analysis; disease burden; disease surveillance; female; human; immigration; India; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; medical examination; Pakistan; Philippines; population research; priority journal; public health; retrospective study; adolescent; health survey; infant; mass screening; migrant; newborn; Ontario; preschool child; procedures; program evaluation; proportional hazards model; tuberculosis; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Emigrants and Immigrants; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Mass Screening; Ontario; Program Evaluation; Proportional Hazards Models; Public Health Surveillance; Retrospective Studies; Tuberculosis",2-s2.0-85060373414

In recent decades, social enterprises have emerged as one alternative site for paid employment. Existing research has examined the experiences of people with mental illness working in social enterprises, but less is known about the organizational character of these workplaces. Objective: The objective of this paper is to develop a better understanding of social enterprises as organizational contexts for workers with mental illness. Methods: The research employed a qualitative methodology, conducting semi-structured interviews with executive directors and managers at 42 organizations operating 67 social enterprises across Canada Results: While there are strong similarities in organizational mandate to create meaningful employment there are also important variations between social enterprises. These include variations in size, economic activity and organizational structure, as well as differences in hours of work, rates of pay and the nature and extent of workplace accommodation. These variations reflect both immediate organizational contexts as well as broader economic constraints that enterprises confront. Conclusions: Understanding the varied nature of social enterprises is important for thinking about future enterprise development, and the capacity of such organizations to create meaningful employment for people living with mental illness. ? 2018 IOS Press and the authors.

Using the debates around the criminalization of HIV non-disclosure as a case study, the aim of this paper is to contribute towards a better understanding of efforts to deny or neutralize victimhood. The paper identifies several strategies utilized by individuals and groups, the object of which is to raise questions about the appropriateness of a criminal response to HIV non-disclosure by constructing those who have had intimate encounters with HIV non-disclosers as equally responsible for their circumstances rather than as victims of non-disclosers. ?

There are no data regarding the risk of complications, including stroke, among patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who undergo DT. Objective: The purpose of this prospectively planned substudy of SIMPLE was to evaluate the effect of DT vs no DT on clinical outcomes among patients with AF. Methods: We compared efficacy (failed appropriate shock/arrhythmic death) and safety between patients who had AF on their immediate preprocedural ECG to the rest of the study patients. Then among patients with AF we compared these outcomes between patients randomized to DT vs no DT. Results: Of the 2500 patients enrolled in SIMPLE, 251 (10%) were in AF immediately before ICD implant. AF patients had an increased risk of failed appropriate shock/arrhythmic death (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 1.64; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.13–2.39; P =.009) and higher all-cause mortality (adjusted HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.2–2.08; P =.001). Among AF patients, perioperative complications and stroke did not significantly differ between DT vs no-DT groups (9.2% vs 5.4%; P =.2; and 1.7% vs 1.5%; P &gt;.999, respectively). Failed appropriate shock or arrhythmic death occurred in 35 of 251 AF patients (14%), and the no-DT group proved not inferior to the DT group (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.30–1.15; Pnoninferiority =.006). Conclusion: ICD recipients with AF are at increased risk for adverse outcomes; however, DT does not improve arrhythmic survival or shock efficacy. There is no evidence that DT increased the occurrence of perioperative stroke. ? 2018 Heart Rhythm Society",Atrial fibrillation; Defibrillation testing; Implantable cardioverter–defibrillator; Stroke; Survival,antiarrhythmic agent; diuretic agent; heparin; inotropic agent; adult; all cause mortality; anticoagulant therapy; Article; atrial fibrillation; brain ischemia; clinical outcome; defibrillation; electrocardiogram; female; follow up; heart arrhythmia; heart atrium pacing; human; international normalized ratio; major clinical study; male; medical history; middle aged; outcome assessment; priority journal; prospective study; shock; sinus rhythm,2-s2.0-85058623338

This approach is guided by basic science data and large observational studies that have demonstrated a consistent association between hyperphosphatemia and adverse events, including cardiovascular morbidity and all-cause mortality. There has never been a clinical trial to assess the efficacy of phosphate lowering in maintenance dialysis recipients.Recent findingsDespite several trials comparing the effect of different phosphate-binding agents on biochemical targets, no trial has evaluated whether targeting normophosphatemia using phosphate binders mediates better patient outcomes. Recent work has highlighted the feasibility of conducting a randomized trial comparing two strategies for phosphate control. We believe that this research question is optimally suited to a pragmatic trial design.SummaryThere is a pressing need for a well-designed randomized controlled trial to evaluate whether intensive phosphate lowering confers improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients receiving maintenance dialysis. We propose a broad framework for such a trial using the principles of pragmatic trial design. The ultimate objective of such a trial will be to provide patients and clinicians with reliable and broadly applicable information on whether reducing serum phosphate toward the normal range improves patient-important outcomes. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

The lack of guidelines to select potential EVT candidates prior to transfer can lead to instances where, despite considerable costs and transport risks, transferred patients do not ultimately undergo EVT. Our aim was to characterize the patterns and identify predictors for EVT on transfer. Methods: In this observational cohort study, we retrospectively analyzed patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) transferred to our institution for EVT evaluation from January 2015 to March 2016. Clinical and radiographic predictors for EVT on transfer were determined with multivariable logistic regression analysis. Results: A total of 103 transfer patients with AIS were included in the study, and 52% were women. A higher collateral score (P < 0.01), a higher National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score (P < 0.01), computed tomography angiography (CTA) at referring hospital (P < 0.01), and large vessel occlusion on arrival CTA (P < 0.01) were significant in patients who underwent EVT on univariable analysis. More than half (61.1%) of transfers were futile and primarily related to absence of large vessel occlusion on arrival. A higher collateral score (P = 0.02), a higher NIHSS score (P = 0.006), and having undergone a CTA at the referring center (P = 0.002) remained the independent predictors of EVT. The C statistic for the model was 0.94. Conclusions: A higher collateral score, the acquisition of CTA imaging at the referring centers, and a higher NIHSS score independently predicted EVT on transfer. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Endovascular treatment; Neuroimaging; Patient transfer; Stroke; Stroke network,"adult; aged; Article; brain ischemia; cohort analysis; computed tomographic angiography; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; observational study; occlusive cerebrovascular disease; patient referral; patient transport; percutaneous thrombectomy; predictive value; retrospective study; treatment outcome; cerebrovascular accident; collateral circulation; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; nonparametric test; patient transport; physiology; procedures; severity of illness index; statistics and numerical data; thrombectomy; very elderly; fibrinolytic agent; tissue plasminogen activator; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cohort Studies; Collateral Circulation; Computed Tomography Angiography; Female; Fibrinolytic Agents; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Transfer; Predictive Value of Tests; Severity of Illness Index; Statistics, Nonparametric; Stroke; Thrombectomy; Tissue Plasminogen Activator; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85055909374

Methods: At age eight, parents of ELBW survivors and NBW control participants completed sleep items on the Child Behavior Checklist assessing the presence of sleep walking/talking, nightmares, or trouble sleeping. At age 30–35, 98 ELBW and 94 NBW individuals completed the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). Analyses were conducted in each birth weight group independently. Results: In NBW participants, sleep walking/talking in childhood predicted higher BAI and BDI scores, as well as more than three times the odds of having a mood or anxiety disorder (OR = 3.48; 95% CI, 1.26–9.60) at age 30–35. Sex and childhood sleep problem interactions revealed that females who manifested sleep walking/talking as children had higher BAI scores than males. Nightmares in children born at NBW predicted higher BAI scores. These associations persisted despite adjustment for child mental health, sex, socioeconomic status, sexual or physical abuse, and family functioning. Trouble sleeping in childhood did not predict adult mental health problems. Childhood sleep problems did not predict psychopathology in ELBW adults. Conclusions: Children born at NBW who manifest sleep walking or talking appear to be at increased risk for developing mood or anxiety disorders in adulthood. No associations between child sleep and adult mental illness were noted in those with ELBW surviviors.

The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether PTB interventions, progesterone, cerclage, and pessary decrease the risk of PTB compared to no treatment in singleton—and separately in twin—pregnancies of women with history of conization. Methods: We searched Cochrane Central, MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1994 until May 2017. In duplicate, we reviewed titles, abstracts, full texts, extracted data, and assessed quality. We included RCTs and observational studies. Our primary outcomes were PTB &lt;34 weeks, PTB &lt;37 weeks, and neonatal mortality. We performed random effects meta-analyses and generated ORs with 95% CIs. Results: We screened 762 nonduplicate titles and abstracts and assessed 91 full texts. After contacting authors, we included nine studies. Women in the cerclage group were more likely to have a short cervix or another risk factor for PTB, raising the possibility of confounding by indication. In women with a history of conization and a singleton who received a cerclage compared to those who did not, the ORs of PTB &lt;34 weeks was 3.99 (95% CI 0.67–23.62, three studies, I2 = 65%); of PTB &lt;37 weeks was 2.10 (95% CI 0.87–5.05, four studies, I2 = 0%); and of neonatal mortality was 8.33 (95% CI 0.22–320.38, two studies, I2 = N/A). We did not find any studies comparing either progesterone or pessary to no treatment. Data for twins were very scarce. Conclusion: In women with a previous conization and a current singleton gestation, the existing evidence, which is likely limited due to confounding by indication, does not support cerclage or other interventions used to try to decrease PTB. ? 2019 Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada",cerclage; conization; meta-analysis; Preterm; systematic review,progesterone; female; human; medical history; meta analysis; newborn mortality; pregnancy; premature labor; Review; risk reduction; systematic review; treatment outcome; twin pregnancy; uterine cervix cerclage; uterine cervix conization,2-s2.0-85055574830

Conscience is central to this framing. Non?participating health centres are assumed to be religious and full participation is expected unless a centre objects on conscience grounds. In this paper we seek to reframe the issue. Institutional non?participation is plausibly not primarily, let alone exclusively, about conscience. We seek to reframe the issue by making two main points. First, institutional non?participation is primarily a matter of institutional self?governance. We suggest that institutions have a natural right of self?governance which, in the case of health centres such as hospitals or hospices, includes the right to choose whether or not to offer MAID. Second, there are various legitimate reasons unrelated to conscience for which a health centre might not offer MAID. These range from considerations such as institutional capacity and expertise to a potential contradiction with palliative care and a concern to not conflate palliative care and MAID in public consciousness. It is a mistake to frame the conversation simply in terms of conscience?based opposition to MAID or full participation. Our goal is to open up new space in the conversation, for reasons unrelated to conscience as well as for non?religious health centres who might nonetheless have legitimate grounds for not participating in MAID. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Conscientious objection; Institutional non?participation; Institutional rights; Medical assistance in dying; Palliative care,"article; conscience; consciousness; conversation; error; health center; hospice; human; human experiment; medical care; palliative therapy; assisted suicide; bioethics; conflict; conscience; health care facility; human rights; palliative therapy; patient abandonment; religion; social control; terminal care; Bioethical Issues; Conscience; Dissent and Disputes; Facility Regulation and Control; Health Facilities; Human Rights; Humans; Palliative Care; Refusal to Treat; Religion and Medicine; Suicide, Assisted; Terminal Care",2-s2.0-85055314446

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to enhance HCMs use of research evidence in practice. Methods: We carried out a systematic review and focus groups to validate the review findings. We searched 10 electronic databases for studies reporting on interventions for HCMs to enhance research utilization in their practice. Qualitative studies were analysed using Hoon’s approach to meta-synthesis. Results: Seven, primarily qualitative, studies of varying quality (reported in 11 articles) met our inclusion criteria. Interventions to enhance research use by HCMs included: informal and formal training, computer-based application, executive-level knowledge translation activities and residency programmes. Studies did not report efficacy of interventions or impacts of increasing managers’ use of research on staff or patient outcomes. Meta-synthesis yielded four contextual factors influencing the perceived effectiveness of interventions to enhance research use by HCMs: organizational culture, competing priorities, time as a resource and capacity building. Included studies differed in how they defined research and demonstrated varying understandings of research among HCMs, limiting the generalizability of work in this field. Conclusions: Healthcare managers are increasingly called upon to make evidence-based decisions in practice, but the small number of studies and diverse strategies employed hinder our ability to identify any intervention to increase use of evidence as superior.

AS was observed in 45 patients (63.4%), 28 of whom experienced AS at the first evaluation after treatment start. Disease control, which includes partial/complete response and stable disease, was seen in 96% of AS patients (43/45), but only in 15/26 (58%) for the remaining patients without evidence of AS (P<0.001). The median PFS of AS patients was 11.4 months (95% confidence interval, 8.6-15.8) versus 8.3 months for patients without AS (95% confidence interval, 5.6-16.4; P=0.04). Conclusions: Chemotherapy plus Bevacizumab combination in mCRC patients results in dynamic changes in plasma cytokines, which is associated with better disease control and longer PFS. These new findings support continuing studying AS as a potential marker of angiogenesis inhibitor effectiveness. ? Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Incorporating bacteriophages onto food-processing surfaces and food packaging can significantly impact food safety. One of the major roadblocks toward using phage as a natural antimicrobial/preservative in food packaging is phage sensitivity to desiccation. We recently developed a coating (film) composed of pullulan and trehalose that proved to be highly effective in preserving the antimicrobial activity of phage for more than 8 weeks. During this investigation, we realized that the conditions under which the films were formed and stored significantly affected the protective ability of these films toward bacteriophage antimicrobials, leading us to design a more in-depth investigation to identify and evaluate the major factors that affect the efficacy of these antimicrobial films. In this work, we report the outcome of a four-factor, two-level full-factorial randomized design of experiments, in which we examined the effects of four processing/storage factors on the short-term and long-term antimicrobial activity of phage-embedded pullulan/trehalose films. The drying method used to make the films and the storage humidity are the two factors that have the most significant impact on the long-term antimicrobial activity of pullulan/trehalose. The long-term viability of the bacteriophage (as measured by loss of titer) can be increased by over 1000-fold by using dry vacuum to form the films and then storing (for 28 days at room temperature) them in a closed container (tube) with low humidity in the headspace. The presence of divalent ions during the drying process and modification of the surface onto which the films were cast did not have a significant effect on long-term phage viability. Coatings, such as a pullulan/trehalose film, can help realize the promise of phage in the food industry. Insights in the control and stabilization of active ingredients in pullulan/trehalose films can also be applied to stabilization of viral vaccines and diagnostic bioassays.

Neurological examination of the patient was unremarkable. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated overt ventriculomegaly with gross dilatation of lateral and third ventricles. Manual segmentation of gray matter, white matter and cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated that the patient had a ventricular volume almost 46 times greater than that of healthy volunteers in the same age range. Despite his striking degree of ventriculomegaly and cortical thinning, he presented primarily with psychiatric and cognitive complaints. These represented a major neurocognitive disorder. His behavior improved with a structured environment and routine instituted by the treating team. This is a dramatic example of the brain’s response to extreme structural remodeling. Elements of pluripotentiality may counteract degeneracy to preserve functions in cases of serious structural stress in the brain. Changes in the neural circuitry of emotional processing, and/or disruption in signaling pathways important for synaptogenesis may influence depression pathophysiology. How this circuitry is modified in cases of extreme structural stress such as long-standing overt ventriculomegaly, is unclear. This case demonstrates the ability of the brain to generate a normal phenotype despite structural changes that seem incompatible with advanced cognitive function, illustrating the substantial potential for adaptability and plasticity in the brain. ? 2018 Alders, Minuzzi, Sarin, Frey, Hall and Samaan.",Depression; Hydrocephalus; MRI; Neuroplasticity; Segmentation; Ventricles; Ventriculomegaly,citalopram; colestyramine; thyroxine; adult; Article; brain aqueduct stenosis; brain ventricle dilatation; case report; clinical article; disease severity; executive function; gait disorder; generalized anxiety disorder; head circumference; hospital discharge; hospital patient; human; hydrocephalus; hypothyroidism; image segmentation; intelligence quotient; major depression; male; memory disorder; middle aged; neuropsychological test; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; panic; patient preference; patient referral; personality disorder; physical examination; Rey Osterrieth complex figure test; scoring system; Stroop test; verbal memory test; Wechsler adult intelligence scale; working memory,2-s2.0-85058984960

Little is known as to the provision of pharmacy services following screening initiatives. Objective To describe provision of pharmacy services for participants following a community pharmacy stroke screening initiative. Setting The Program for the Identification of “Actionable Atrial” Fibrillation Pharmacy initiative took place in 30 pharmacies in Alberta and Ontario, Canada. 1149 participants ? 65 were screened for atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension. Method Retrospective, secondary analysis of data using participant case-report forms, pharmacy data, and pharmacy claims to describe pharmacy services received by participants post-screening. Main Outcome Measure Number and types of remunerated pharmacy services received by participants post-screening. Results A total of 535/1149 (46.6%) participants screened at their regular pharmacy were included in this analysis. Of these, 165 (30.8%) participants received 229 pharmacy services within 3?months post-screening, including 146 medication reviews, 57 influenza vaccinations, and 21 pharmaceutical opinions. A median (interquartile range, IQR) of 6 (2–11) pharmacy services were delivered, and median (IQR) reimbursement was $187.50 ($67.50–$342.50). Conclusions Approximately one-third of participants received a pharmacy service within 3?months post-screening. Relatively large numbers of annual and follow-up medication reviews were delivered despite low eligibility for annual-only reviews and despite many missed opportunities for pharmacy service provision in at-risk patients. In-pharmacy screening may facilitate provision of some services, namely medication reviews, by providing opportunities to identify patients at-risk. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Canada; Chronic disease; Mass screening; Medication; Pharmaceutical services; Pharmacies; Review,"aged; Article; atrial fibrillation; Canada; female; follow up; hospital department; human; hypertension; influenza vaccination; major clinical study; male; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; outcome assessment; pharmacy; priority journal; reimbursement; retrospective study; screening; Alberta; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; drug utilization; hypertension; mass screening; medication therapy management; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; Ontario; pharmacy (shop); risk assessment; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alberta; Atrial Fibrillation; Community Pharmacy Services; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Drug Utilization; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Mass Screening; Medication Therapy Management; Ontario; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Stroke",2-s2.0-85057562602

Methods: Data reported to the TRA and NPRI by industrial facilities in Ontario were retrieved from 2011 to 2015. Twenty-six known and suspected carcinogens were identified (IARC) and the trends in the use and emission were evaluated by industry sector. The locations of industrial facilities that used and released carcinogens were mapped by Public Health Unit (PHU). Results: Chemical manufacturing and primary metal manufacturing sectors accounted for 84% of all reported industrial use of carcinogens during the period 2011–2015. The largest source of carcinogen emissions came from facilities in the primary metal manufacturing and paper manufacturing sectors. The largest number of industrial facilities that reported the use and release of carcinogens were located in the City of Toronto and Peel Region PHUs. Overall, the use of carcinogens across all sectors appeared to decrease by 8%, while emissions increased by about 2%. Conclusion: The results of this study show the need to reduce the use and emission of select carcinogens in priority industry sectors. Environmental reporting programs, such as the TRA and NPRI, can serve as important tools in cancer prevention by tracking potential carcinogen exposures in the environment and in the workplace. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Environmental carcinogens; Environmental exposure; Industry; Manufacturing and industrial facilities; Prevention and control,,2-s2.0-85057551834

We introduce four aspects: clarifying the objectives; generating an appropriate research question; planning the study; and reporting and analyzing data. This paper has several highlights. (1) There are four types of prognostic studies: Type I—fundamental prognostic research, Type II—prognostic factors research, Type III—prediction model research, and Type IV—stratified medicine research. (2) We present the defining characteristics for each type of prognostic study. (3) For Types I-III, we suggest that “PFOT? components (target Population, prognostic or predictive Factor[s] or a predictive model with a combination of multiple Factors, Outcome, and follow-up Time) should be included in the research questions; for Type IV, “PIFOT? components (Intervention was added to PFOT) should be included in the research questions. (4) As with other study designs, prognostic studies should be registered to help mitigate duplication of effort across study teams and to accelerate the pace of scientific evolution. (5) Sample size calculations are an important step for prognostic studies. (6) Confounders and missing data issues should be considered carefully during study planning, reporting, and analyzing data. (7) For Type III studies, at least an internal validation should be performed, and univariable analysis to select significant variables (e.g., p-value < 0.05) for a multivariable model is not recommended. (8) A test for interaction is a necessary step for Type IV prognostic studies. A high-quality prognostic study would benefit from clinicians, methodologists, and statisticians working together. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,calculation; clinician; controlled study; follow up; human; prediction; review; sample size; statistical significance; validation process; diagnostic procedure; genetics; medical research; methodology; neoplasm; pathology; patient selection; standard; standards; Biomedical Research; Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures; Humans; Neoplasms; Patient Selection; Reference Standards; Research Design,2-s2.0-85056700724

The use of outcome measures to evaluate upper limb function is essential to assess sensorimotor recovery and to determine the effectiveness of rehabilitation. The aim of this study was to estimate the construct validity and inter-rater reliability of three shortened versions of the Singapore version of the Chedoke Arm and Hand Activity Inventory (CAHAI-SG) comprising seven, eight, and nine test items. The sample consisted of 55 inpatients with acute/subacute stroke to whom the CAHAI-SG, Fugl-Meyer Assessment of Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) and the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) were administered. To estimate convergent and discriminative construct validity, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient and 95% confidence intervals were computed for CAHAI-SG scores with FMA-UE and ARAT scores. Reliability was estimated using intraclass correlation coefficient (relative reliability) and the standard error of measurement (absolute reliability). Convergent validity with the FMA-UE was 0.79, 0.80, and 0.81 for sevenitem, eight-item, and nine-item versions of the CAHAI-SG, respectively, and 0.81 with the ARAT for all shortened versions. Discriminative validity with the FMA-UE pain subscale was between 0.37 and 0.38. The absolute reliability was 3.09, 3.65, and 3.98, and relative reliability was 0.96, 0.95, and 0.96 for the seven-item, eight-item, and nine-item versions, respectively. All shortened versions of the CAHAISG demonstrated similar psychometric properties to the full (13 item) version, meaning clinicians may use these shorter versions that require less time to administer and score. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

They try to address many risk factors simultaneously, are often overlapped in their implementation, and their implementation may be phased over time. This article proposes a statistical and analytic framework for evaluating the effectiveness of multilevel, multisystem, multi-component, community-driven, dynamic interventions. The proposed framework builds on meta regression methodology and recently proposed approaches for pooling results from multi-component intervention studies. The methodology is applied to the evaluation of the effectiveness of South African community-centered injury prevention and safety promotion interventions. The proposed framework allows for complex interventions to be disaggregated into their constituent parts in order to extract their specific effects. The potential utility of the framework is successfully illustrated using contact crime data from select police stations in Johannesburg. The proposed framework and statistical guidelines proved to be useful to study the effectiveness of complex, dynamic, community-based interventions as a whole and of their components. The framework may help researchers and policy makers to adopt and study a specific methodology for evaluating the effectiveness of complex intervention programs. ?

Qualitative description guided our analysis of semi-structured interviews with 13 informal caregivers of older adults from three LTC homes in southern Ontario. Our findings illustrate that caregivers experience chronic worry and burden before deciding on, or requiring to apply for, LTC. A sense of lack of control was a prominent theme, especially when caregivers were applying for LTC beds. Participants perceived pushing, pressure, and punishment from the health care system and felt relieved and fortunate after they accepted a bed offer. This tumultuous experience stimulated caregivers to anticipate future transitions. It is recommended that caregivers receive preparation and targeted support to manage transition experiences. Improved communication among health professionals is essential. Penalties for declining an offer for a bed in LTC should be re-examined in relation to its negative influence on caregivers' experiences. ?

Therefore, two systematic reviews were performed to identify the following: 1) RBC transfusion guidelines and review articles to determine if single- or multiple-unit transfusion strategies are recommended and 2) studies comparing strategies for evidence of benefit. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, National Guideline Clearinghouse, and Trip Database were searched (inception to June 2017). For the first review, the proportion of articles with single/multiple-unit recommendations was assessed and stratified by article type. For the second review, the primary outcome was RBC use. Secondary outcomes included proportion of transfusion episodes using a single-unit strategy, length of stay, and mortality. RESULTS: The first review identified 145 articles for analysis, with 51 transfusion guidelines. Only 14 guidelines (27%) made a recommendation, with most (93%) recommending single-unit transfusions. The second review identified seven cohort studies comparing preimplementation and postimplementation of a policy encouraging single-unit transfusion strategies. Meta-analysis could not be performed for outcomes given inconsistencies in reporting. RBC use decreased by approximately 10 to 41% across studies. CONCLUSION: Transfusion guidelines lack recommendations to transfuse to a single-unit strategy. Mostly retrospective cohort studies (six of seven) are inconsistent in outcome reporting but suggest improved RBC use. Further high-quality studies could identify the benefits of a single-unit transfusion strategy, determine the applicability to different clinical settings, and inform future practice guidelines. ? 2018 AABB",,article; Cinahl; cohort analysis; Embase; erythrocyte transfusion; human; human cell; length of stay; Medline; meta analysis; mortality; outcome assessment; practice guideline; retrospective study; systematic review; Web of Science; female; male; practice guideline; procedures; standards; Erythrocyte Transfusion; Female; Humans; Male; Practice Guidelines as Topic,2-s2.0-85055284960

The risk is further increased in patients who develop ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome [1]. This possibility should be considered in this group of patients presenting with acute abdominal pain and immediate management should be commenced. Here, we report 2 patients who received treatment for infertility with IVF and developed ovarian torsion and we discuss their management including the imaging workup. The first case is a 34-year-old woman at 11 + 3 weeks of gestation after IVF who presented with a 12-hour acute right lower abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting. She underwent an ultrasound examination and then further evaluated with magnetic resonance imaging which showed asymmetric enlargement of the right ovary and stromal edema and a diagnosis of ovarian torsion was made. The patient underwent laparoscopic detortion and the ovary was salvaged. The second case is a 33-year-old woman at 9 weeks of gestation after IVF who presented with intermittent abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, and nausea and vomiting for 5 days but became worse on the fifth day. Ultrasound and subsequently magnetic resonance imaging were performed which confirmed hyperstimulation syndrome. Abnormal location of the left ovary anterior to the uterus with higher volume as well as the clinical progression raised the possibility of ovarian torsion and prompted a diagnostic laparoscopy which showed right ovarian torsion and detortion was performed. ? 2018",Complication; In vitro fertilization; Ovarian torsion; Pregnancy,abdominal tenderness; acute appendicitis; adult; artery blood flow; Article; blood analysis; case report; clinical article; colonoscopy; disease exacerbation; disease severity; echography; Fallopian tube; female; gestational age; human; image analysis; in vitro fertilization; intraoperative period; laparoscopy; leukocytosis; lower abdominal pain; male infertility; medical history; nausea and vomiting; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ovary cyst; ovary disease; ovary hyperstimulation; postoperative period; pregnancy; priority journal; ulcerative colitis; vagina bleeding; vein blood flow,2-s2.0-85053303836

Data Sources: Secondary data were collected from all LTC homes in Ontario, Canada, between January 1, 2011 and March 31, 2015. Variables of interest were the proportion of residents per home receiving physical therapy (PT), and the scores on seven ADL and one falls QI. Study Design: Retrospective, longitudinal study. Data Extraction: All data were extracted from the Resident Assessment Instrument Minimum Data Set. Principal Findings: Fewer residents received PT after the policy change (84.6 percent, 2011; 56.6 percent, 2015). The policy change was associated with improved performance on several ADL QIs. However, having a large proportion of residents receive no PT or little PT was associated with poorer performance on two of the QIs measuring improvement in ADLs [No PT: ?0.029 (?0.043 to ?0.014); ?0.048 (?0.068 to ?0.027).

The objective of this study was to estimate the direct health-care costs and indirect costs associated with hypoglycemia based on a Canadian cohort of 498 patients from the global Hypoglycemia Assessment Tool (HAT) study. Methods: A costing model was developed to estimate the direct costs related to experiencing hypoglycemia by using health-care resources associated with hospital admissions and additional clinical appointments that were prospectively reported 1 month after baseline in the HAT study. Data collected retrospectively on work absenteeism in the year prior to baseline were used to estimate the indirect costs of hypoglycemia events. All costs were annualized and reported in 2016 Canadian dollars. Results: Of the 403 patients with diabetes who experienced hypoglycemia events in the first month after baseline (81%), 10 (2.5%) patients required hospitalization or clinical appointments. Over 1 year, the mean direct health-care costs were estimated to be C$90,300 (C$1,777 per patient) for hospitalizations and C$14,695 (C$204 per person) for additional clinical appointments. Work absenteeism resulted in a total annual indirect cost of C$20,937 for time off due to sick leave (C$500 per patient), arriving late (C$187 per patient) or leaving work early (C$128 per patient). The annual direct and indirect costs of hypoglycemia events total C$125,932. Conclusions: The impact of hypoglycemia events on health-care resource utilization and work productivity leads to substantial direct and indirect costs in Canadian patients with diabetes. ? 2018 Diabetes Canada",costs; diabetes mellitus; hypoglycemia; indirect; productivity,"absenteeism; adult; Article; Canada; controlled study; disease association; female; health care cost; health care utilization; health program; hospitalization; human; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; major clinical study; male; medical leave; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; productivity; productivity cost; prospective study; cohort analysis; economics; health care cost; hypoglycemia; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; psychology; statistics and numerical data; Absenteeism; Adult; Canada; Cohort Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Efficiency; Female; Health Care Costs; Hospitalization; Humans; Hypoglycemia; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Sick Leave",2-s2.0-85048016419

The extent to which this variation is driven by biological factors influencing the HIV transmission rate or by variation in sexual network characteristics remains widely debated. Here, we leverage couple serostatus patterns to address this question. HIV prevalence is strongly correlated with couple serostatus patterns across the continent; in particular, high prevalence countries tend to have a lower ratio of serodiscordancy to concordant positivity. To investigate the drivers of this continental pattern, we fit an HIV transmission model to Demographic and Health Survey data from 45,041 cohabiting couples in 25 countries. In doing so, we estimated country-specific HIV transmission rates and sexual network characteristics reflective of pre-couple and extra-couple sexual contact patterns. We found that variation in the transmission rate could parsimoniously explain between-country variation in both couple serostatus patterns and prevalence. In contrast, between-country variation in pre-couple or extra-couple sexual contact rates could not explain the observed patterns. Sensitivity analyses suggest that future work should examine the robustness of this result to between-country variation in how heterogeneous infection risk is within a country, or to assortativity, i.e. the extent to which individuals at higher risk are likely to partner with each other. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"adult; Africa south of the Sahara; article; cohabiting person; driver; health survey; human; Human immunodeficiency virus prevalence; infection risk; sensitivity analysis; Africa south of the Sahara; blood; disease transmission; family size; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; seroepidemiology; sexual behavior; Human immunodeficiency virus antibody; Africa South of the Sahara; Disease Transmission, Infectious; Family Characteristics; HIV Antibodies; HIV Infections; Seroepidemiologic Studies; Sexual Behavior",2-s2.0-85046114711

Test–retest reliability was acceptable. Convergent and discriminant construct validation findings suggested that the UEFI is an appropriate measure for estimating upper extremity activity limitations in this population. Background: Activity limitations as well as impairments such as pain, numbness, limitation of shoulder range of motion, and weakness are common and well documented during and after treatment for breast cancer. There is limited information regarding the measurement properties of patient-reported outcome measures of upper extremity activity limitation in this population. This study examined the reliability and validity of the Upper Extremity Functional Index (UEFI) in patients after surgery for breast cancer. Patients and Methods: Measures of function, shoulder flexion range of motion, and pain were obtained for 53 women before and 2 weeks after surgery for breast cancer. To estimate UEFI test–retest reliability, a convenience sample of 20 patients was assessed on a second occasion within 48 hours of their 2-week postsurgery assessment. Convergent and discriminant construct validation methods were applied by examining correlations between UEFI scores and change scores with those of the shortened version of the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (QuickDASH), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Breast (FACT-B) +4 items, shoulder flexion range, and pain. Results: UEFI test–retest reliability was estimated to be 0.87 (95% confidence interval, 0.69, 0.94), and the standard error of measurement was 4.8 (95% confidence interval, 3.7, 7.1) scale points. The 90% confidence interval for a given UEFI score was ±7.9 and minimal detectable change at 90% confidence (MDC 90 ) was ±11.1 points. UEFI correlations with the QuickDASH (cross-sectional ?0.79 and longitudinal ?0.62) were greater than with the FACT-B+4 and impairment measures.

To reduce the risk of an SSI, orthopaedic surgeons routinely clean open fracture wounds in the emergency department (ED) and then apply a bandage to the open wound. Prior to the surgical incision, it is standard practice to prepare the fracture region with an antiseptic skin solution as an additional SSI prevention strategy. Multiple antiseptic solutions are available. Objectives: To explore the variation in practice patterns among orthopaedic surgeons regarding antiseptic solution use in the ED and antiseptic preparatory techniques for fracture surgery. Methods: We developed a 27-item survey and surveyed members of several orthopaedic associations. Results: Two hundred and-ten surveys were completed. 71.0% of respondents irrigate the open wound and skin in the ED, primarily with saline alone (59.7%) or iodine-based solutions (32.9%). 90.5% of responders indicated that they dress the open wound in the ED, with 41.0% applying a saline-soaked bandage and 33.7% applying an iodine-soaked dressing (33.7%). In their surgical preparation of open fractures, 41.0% of respondents used an iodine-based solution, 26.7% used a chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG)-based solution, and 31.4% used a combination of the two. In closed fractures, 43.8% of respondents used a CHG-based solution, 28.1% used an iodine-based solution, and 27.1% used a combination. Despite theoretical concerns about the use of alcohol in open wounds, 51.4% used alcohol-based solutions or alcohol alone during skin preparation of open fractures. Conclusions: A lack of consensus exists regarding use of antiseptic surgical preparation solutions for fractures. High-quality clinical research is needed to assess the effectiveness of different surgical antiseptic preparation solutions on patient outcomes in fracture populations. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Antiseptic preparation; Antiseptic solution; Closed fracture; Open fracture; Surgical preparation; Surgical site infection; Survey,"alcohol; antiinfective agent; chlorhexidine gluconate; iodophor; alcohol derivative; iodine; topical antiinfective agent; adult; aged; clinical decision making; controlled study; emergency ward; female; health care personnel; health survey; human; limb fracture; male; middle aged; orthopedic surgeon; practice guideline; priority journal; questionnaire; Review; risk factor; sample size; surgical infection; administration and dosage; bandage; cross-sectional study; disinfection; fracture; injury; open fracture; orthopedics; preoperative care; procedures; skin; surgical infection; wound healing; Adult; Alcohols; Anti-Infective Agents, Local; Bandages; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disinfection; Ethanol; Female; Fractures, Closed; Fractures, Open; Humans; Iodine; Male; Middle Aged; Orthopedics; Preoperative Care; Saline Solution; Skin; Surgical Wound Infection; Surveys and Questionnaires; Wound Healing",2-s2.0-85057450571

Approach: In vivo measurements of gadolinium retention in the tibia bone were performed on individuals self-identified as exhibiting symptoms of gadolinium toxicity as a result of receiving GBCA, as well as on control individuals. Gadolinium urine measurements for controls, symptomatic exposed, and non-symptomatic exposed were conducted through Mayo Medical Laboratories. Main results: Gadolinium bone concentration in the exposed group is significantly higher than the control group (p &lt; 0.01), with a significant difference between symptomatic and non-symptomatic (p &lt; 0.01), using a one-tailed t test on variance-weighted means. Gadolinium urine levels in both control subjects and non-symptomatic exposed subjects are significantly lower than symptomatic exposed subjects (p ? 0.05).

To the best of our knowledge, there are only 55 reported cases worldwide. Here, we report a new case of SDH-deficient RCC. Case presentation: A 49-year-old male patient was incidentally found to have a large right renal mass. He had no personal or family history of paragangliomas (PGL), pheochromocytomas (PC), or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST). The neoplasm was unilateral and unifocal. He underwent an open partial nephrectomy. Detailed pathological analysis was conducted to confirm the diagnosis. Genetic testing revealed a pathogenic mutation in the SDHB gene. He has been followed for 24 months now and has remained well without any evidence of local or distant recurrence. In this report we describe our experience with this diagnosis and review the relevant clinical, pathological, and genetic features. Conclusions: Without the identification of SDHB deficiency, this patient's personal and familial predisposition to PC, PGL, GIST and metachronous RCCs may have gone undetected despite his RCC diagnosis. When faced with an eosinophilic RCC, pathologists should routinely search for vacuoles or flocculent cytoplasmic inclusions. When these are present, or in cases of difficult eosinophilic renal tumors, staining for SDHB is recommended. For tumours without adverse pathologic features (i.e. high nuclear grade, coagulative necrosis, or sarcomatoid differentiation) excision alone may be a reasonable option, with the addition of regular surveillance for PC and PGLs in those found to harbor germline SDH mutations. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Kidney cancer; Succinate dehydrogenase-deficient renal cell carcinoma,"2 methylacyl coenzyme A racemase; creatinine; cytokeratin AE1; cytokeratin AE3; epithelial membrane antigen; hemoglobin; succinate dehydrogenase; transcription factor PAX8; SDHB protein, human; succinate dehydrogenase; abdominal pain; abdominal wall hernia; adult; Article; cancer grading; cancer staging; case report; cell vacuole; clinical article; clinical feature; complex II deficiency; estimated glomerular filtration rate; follow up; gene; gene mutation; genetic counseling; genetic screening; germline mutation; hemoglobin blood level; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; incidental finding; kidney biopsy; kidney cyst; male; medical history; microscopy; middle aged; partial nephrectomy; physical examination; renal cell carcinoma; renography; SDHB gene; succinate dehydrogenase deficient renal cell carcinoma; tubular dysfunction; tumor volume; x-ray computed tomography; deficiency; diagnostic imaging; enzymology; genetics; kidney tumor; renal cell carcinoma; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Succinate Dehydrogenase",2-s2.0-85057235208

We tried to find optimal stimulation parameters in order to elicit a robust reproducible TSP phenomenon. Twenty healthy volunteers (15 women and 5 men) completed four sessions/conditions of pulsating heat pain stimulation, applied to the left forearm with a frequency of 0.33–0.4 sec–1 using a contact heat-evoked potential stimulator. The stimulation temperature (step +0.5°C or +1.0°C up to the pain threshold, pain tolerance), pulse duration (500, 800, or 1000 msec), and number of stimuli (60 or 90) were varied. The participants rated the pain intensity at the first and every 10th heat pulse, using a numeric rating scale (NRS) 0–100. The TSP was calculated as the difference between the lowest rating and the rating of the last stimulus and was compared between conditions. The optimal condition (19 out of 20 participants responded with TSP) showed temperature at pain tolerance, pulse duration of 800 msec, and 90 stimuli. In addition, this condition showed weaker side effects (painful discomfort) than those with less (60) but longer (1000 msec) stimuli presented 1.0 degree above the pain threshold. The protocol with a relatively high stimulus repetition and a moderate pulse duration seems to be the optimal protocol to reproduce TSP. Heat stimulation with longer pulse durations and higher stimulation temperatures was less feasible. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",experimental heat pain; healthy subjects; heat pain modulation; temporal summation,Article; female; gender; heat pain; human; human experiment; male; normal human; numeric rating scale; pain; pain intensity; pain threshold; pilot study; stimulus response; temporal summation; thermal stimulation,2-s2.0-85065303040

Impaired attentional processes have been linked with poor outcomes after stroke, but their radiographical correlates have been infrequently studied. Our objective was to assess the relationship between stroke location and vigilant attention. Methods. A total of 39 patients presenting within 2 weeks of a minor stroke were prospectively recruited. Vigilant attention was assessed using the psychomotor vigilance task (PVT), and neuroimaging was used to assess stroke location, white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden, and ischemic stroke involvement within lateral cholinergic projections. Correlational analyses and linear regression models tested the association between PVT performance and our neuroimaging parameters of interest. Subtractions of lesion overlays were used to identify brain regions of acute stroke patients who performed most poorly on the PVT. Results. Subcortical stroke location was a predictor of PVT performance in this cohort of acute stroke patients. Patients who performed most poorly on the PVT had lesions in the corona radiata, internal capsule, globus pallidus, and thalamus. Global WMH burden and cerebrovascular disease in lateral cholinergic pathways were not significant predictors of PVT performance. Interpretation. Subcortical stroke location was associated with impaired vigilant attention. The poorest PVT performers had stroke lesions involving the corona radiata, internal capsule, globus pallidus, and thalamus, suggesting that vigilance depends on the integrity of subcortical structures and their connections with cortical brain regions. ?

We aimed to evaluate adverse events and safety outcomes with ADS vs. PDS for DT testing. Methods and results: A post hoc analysis of the Shockless Implant Evaluation (SIMPLE) study was performed among the 1242 patients who had DT testing (624 ADS and 618 PDS). We evaluated both intraoperative and in-hospital adverse composite events and two safety composite outcomes at 30-days of the main trial. Propensity score adjusted models were used to compute odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to evaluate the association between adverse and safety outcomes with method of sedation and independent predictors for use of ADS. Compared to PDS, patients who received ADS were younger (62 ± 12 years vs. 64 ± 12 years, P = 0.01), had lower ejection fraction (left ventricular ejection fraction 0.31 ± 13 vs. 0.33 ± 13, P = 0.03), were more likely to receive inhalational anaesthesia, propofol, or narcotics (P < 0.001, respectively) and receive an arterial line (43% vs. 8%, P = <0.0001). Independent predictors for ADS sedation were presence of coronary artery disease (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.0-2.72; P = 0.03) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (OR 2.64, 95% CI 1.19-5.85; P = 0.02). Anaesthesiologist directed sedation had higher intraoperative adverse events (2.2% vs. 0.5%; OR 4.47, 95% CI 1.25-16.0; P = 0.02) and higher primary safety outcomes at 30 days (8.2% vs. 4.9%; OR 1.72 95% CI 1.06-2.80; P = 0.03) and no difference in other outcomes compared to PDS. Conclusion: Proceduralist-directed sedation is safe, however, this could be result of selection bias.

A rigorous understanding of the palliative approach requires a conceptual model, which links the philosophy of palliative care to specific actions of practitioners, and is applicable to patients with any life-threatening illness, at any point on the disease trajectory, and provided by any care provider in any setting. This article proposes a conceptual model asserting that a palliative approach exists when care simultaneously addresses whole-person needs, enhances quality of life, and acknowledges mortality. Objective: To test the content validity of the proposed model against definitions of palliative care in existing literature. Design: Electronic and manual literature searches identified definitions of palliative care and palliative approach. Two authors independently conducted thematic analysis to assess congruence with the domains of the proposed conceptual model. Results: Nineteen definitions were identified. The three domains were represented in the majority: whole-person care (17/19), quality-of-life focus (17/19), and mortality acknowledgement (15/19). Published definitions also included other concepts, but only one of these (family within the unit of care) appeared in more than a few definitions. Conclusions: The content validity of the proposed conceptual model is supported by the consistent presence of the three domains in published definitions. This conceptual model bridges philosophical definitions and clinician behavior and has potential to inform broad implementation of a palliative approach, at both clinic and system levels. ?

However, discourses on their practices as formalised cadres of the HS are limited. Therefore, we examined their role in care, referral (to clinics) and rehabilitation of severe acute malnutrition (SAM) cases. Focusing on SAM was essential since it is a global public health problem associated with 30% of all South Africa's (SA's) child deaths in 2015. Guided by a policy analysis framework, a qualitative case study was conducted in two rural subdistricts of North West province. From April to August 2016, data collected from CHW's training manuals and guideline reviews, 20 patient record reviews and 15 in-depth interviews with four CHW leaders and 11 CHWs. Using thematic content analysis which was guided by the Walt and Gilson policy triangle, data was manually analysed to derive emerging themes on case management and administrative structures. The study found that although CHWs were responsible for identifying, referring, and rehabilitating SAM cases, they neglected curative roles of stabilisation before referral and treatment of uncomplicated cases. Such limitations resulted from restrictive CHW policies, inadequate training, lack of supportive supervision and essential resources. Concurrently, the CHW program was based on weak operational and administrative structures which challenged CHWs practices. Poor curative components and weak operational structures in this context compromised the use of CHWs in LMICs to strengthen primary healthcare. If CHWs are to contribute to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3 by reducing SAM mortality, strategies on community management of acute malnutrition coupled with thorough training, supportive supervision, firm operational structures, adequate resources and providers’ motivation should be adopted by governments. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",community health workers (CHWs); community management of acute malnutrition (CMAM); healthcare referral; severe acute malnutrition (SAM); South Africa (SA),adult; case management; child; community care; female; health auxiliary; human; male; malnutrition; organization and management; preventive health service; primary health care; qualitative research; rural population; South Africa; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Case Management; Child; Community Health Services; Community Health Workers; Female; Humans; Male; Malnutrition; Preventive Health Services; Primary Health Care; Qualitative Research; Rural Population; Severe Acute Malnutrition; South Africa,2-s2.0-85054318643

Methods: The following databases were searched for studies that were randomized or quasi-randomized trials comparing nontumescent-based endovenous procedures with those requiring tumescence: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1950-January 2017), MEDLINE (1946-January 2017), and Embase (1950-January 2017). There were no restrictions based on language or publication status. In the case of ongoing studies, the World Health Organization's International Clinical Trials Registry Platform and the online ClinicalTrials.gov registry were also searched. We also reviewed reference lists of articles relevant to our study to ensure a more complete review. Two authors independently screened and selected studies to be included. These two authors also independently assessed the risk of bias using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were extracted and pooled using a random-effects model. Results: A total of nine studies were found in the literature search, of which five were included in analysis. Four outcomes were reviewed. A significant difference was found between the comparator groups for mean intraprocedural pain score (effect estimate, ?0.66), favoring nontumescent-based therapies. There was no difference for Venous Clinical Severity Score (effect estimate, ?0.21) for clinical assessment and the Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire score (effect estimate, 0.27) for the disease-specific quality of life between the groups. The outcome of failure of truncal ablation at 30 days had no significant difference between the groups (risk ratio, 1.27), although a subgroup analysis demonstrated a trend toward improved results with the novel nontumescent-based treatments (risk ratio, 0.21) compared with the old nontumescent-based treatments (risk ratio, 8.6). Conclusions: Currently available evidence from reasonable-quality clinical trials comparing tumescent-based with non-tumescent-based endovenous therapies shows no overall difference between the groups on a number of outcomes. Mean intraprocedural pain score appears to favor nontumescent-based interventions. Newer randomized trials comparing the treatment modalities are needed to further clarify the benefits of nontumescent-based therapies, particularly with regard to long-term outcomes. ? 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery",Ablation; Endovenous; EVLT; Saphenous insufficiency; Tumescence; Varicose veins; Venous reflux,"cyanoacrylate; polidocanol; Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire score; ablation therapy; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; disease severity assessment; human; priority journal; procedural pain; quality of life; quality of life assessment; Review; saphenous insufficiency; saphenous vein; therapy effect; treatment duration; treatment failure; tumescent based endovenous therapy; varicosis; vein disease; vein occlusion; Venous Clinical Severity Score; adverse event; artificial embolization; diagnostic imaging; endovascular surgery; female; local anesthesia; male; meta analysis; postoperative complication; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; sclerotherapy; treatment outcome; varicosis; vein insufficiency; Anesthesia, Local; Embolization, Therapeutic; Endovascular Procedures; Female; Humans; Male; Postoperative Complications; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Saphenous Vein; Sclerotherapy; Treatment Outcome; Varicose Veins; Venous Insufficiency",2-s2.0-85054188987

For example, EC fleet (full ECs, no hybrid ECs) do not emit gaseous pollutants, but still emit a certain amount of particulate matter. Full ECs emit particulate matter through their non-exhaust sources, which includes wear and tear of tires and brakes. Often, non-exhaust particulate emissions are neglected by decision makers and environmental agencies. This may impact the development of effective environmental and public health policies. In this paper, we assess particulate matter emissions (PM10 and PM2.5) considering two EC adoption scenarios within a major metropolitan area in Canada-Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). In addition, we estimate potential human health risk for each scenario. Our results show that non-exhaust particle emissions (brake and tire) consist of mostly PM10. We estimate that for Scenarios 1 (10% of EC penetration) and 2 (100% of EC penetration), the respective emission reductions (exhaust + brake + tire) will be 37 and 94% for PM2.5, and 4 and 85% for PM10. Furthermore, compared to baseline, 10 and 100% EC adoption scenarios will reduce PM-related annual deaths by 37 and 87%, respectively. However, even considering the aggressive 100% EC adoption scenario, we will still have considerable PM10 and PM2.5 non-tailpipe emissions, i.e., ~ 743 and 189?kg?day?1, respectively. If 100% EC adoption scenario is realized, each individual in the GTHA will inhale about 0.80 × 10?3?ppm?day?1 (where 1?ppm indicates that 1?g inhaled per each ton emitted). Our results underline the importance of non-tailpipe emissions. Therefore, we suggest that environmental agencies must develop policies to account for and limit non-exhaust PM emissions, and the automotive industry must focus on reducing non-exhaust emissions from ECs. ? 2018, Springer Nature B.V.",Air pollution; Electric mobility; Human health; Particulate matter,atmospheric pollution; electric vehicle; emission control; environmental policy; health policy; health risk; metropolitan area; mobility; particulate matter; public health; traffic emission; Canada; Hamilton [Ontario]; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto,2-s2.0-85051469450

The device is a cuff attached to the distal esophagus by transmural anchors and connected to a 120-cm sleeve diverting undigested nutrients to the jejunum. Bodyweight, vital signs, adverse events, medications, HbA1c, fasting glucose, and lipids were collected at baseline and follow-up visits. Device status was endoscopically assessed every 6 months. Results: The fully trans-oral procedure was successful in all subjects without intraoperative adverse events or postoperative infections. Twenty-eight of 32 subjects (88%) remained implanted with continuing follow-up beyond their 12-month visit. At 12 months, the 32 subjects had lost an average of 44.8% of excess body weight, 17.6% of total body weight, 20.8?kg, and 7.5 BMI points. Weight loss depended on capture of ingesta by the esophageal cuff, with 18 of 32 subjects without visible gaps around their cuffs at the 6 month endoscopy having significantly greater EWL (53.6 vs. 33.4% in the remaining subjects, p < 0.002). Mean HbA1c and fasting glucose declined by 1.1% points and 29?mg/dL in type 2 diabetic subjects, 80% of whom had remission of their diabetes at 12 months. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of a fully trans-oral gastrointestinal bypass implant. This purely endoscopic device may provide a valuable addition to the armamentarium of treatment available for the management of morbid obesity. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",And endoscopic surgery; Bariatric surgery; Endoluminal bariatric surgery; Gastric bypass; Obesity; Surgical endoscopy,"glucose; hemoglobin A1c; lipid; abdominal surgery; adult; Article; body weight; body weight loss; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; clinical outcome; diabetes mellitus; diabetic patient; dysphagia; endoscopic surgery; endoscopy; epigastric pain; esophagus; esophagus mucosa; fasting; female; follow up; gastric bypass surgery; gastroesophageal junction; heartburn; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; intestine contraction; laparotomy; male; metabolic syndrome X; multicenter study; nausea and vomiting; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obese patient; obesity; operation duration; outcome assessment; postoperative infection; priority journal; prospective study; quality of life; regurgitation; remission; safety procedure; small intestine; surgical technique; vital sign; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; clinical trial; devices; feasibility study; gastric bypass surgery; middle aged; morbid obesity; natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery; patient safety; procedures; prostheses and orthoses; treatment outcome; Adult; Feasibility Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gastric Bypass; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery; Obesity, Morbid; Patient Safety; Prospective Studies; Prostheses and Implants; Treatment Outcome; Weight Loss",2-s2.0-85045749404

We aimed to identify potentially modifiable factors to improve DIDO times in Ontario, Canada and to assess the impact of DIDO times on 30-day mortality. Methods: A population-based, retrospective cohort study of 966 STEMI patients transferred for primary PCI in Ontario in 2012 was conducted. Baseline factors were examined across timely DIDO status. Multivariate logistic regression was used to examine independent predictors of timely DIDO as well as the association between DIDO times and 30-day mortality. Results: The median DIDO time was 55 min, with 20.1% of patients achieving the recommended DIDO benchmark of ?30 min. Age (OR&gt; 75 vs 18-55 0.30, 95% CI: 0.16-0.56), symptom-to-first medical contact (FMC) time (OR61-120mins vs &lt; 60mins 0.60, 95% CI: 0.39-0.90; OR&gt;120mins vs &lt; 60mins 0.53, 95% CI:0.35-0.81) and emergency medical services transport with a pre-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG) (OREMS transport + ECG vs self-transport 2.63, 95% CI:1.59-4.35) were the strongest predictors of timely DIDO. Patients with timely ECG were more likely to have recommended DIDO times (33.0% vs 12.3%; P &lt; 0.001). A significantly higher proportion of those who met the DIDO benchmark had timely FMC-to-balloon times (78.7% vs 27.4%; P &lt; 0.001). Compared to patients with DIDO time ? 30 min, those with DIDO times &gt; 90 min had significantly higher adjusted 30-day mortality rates (OR 2.82, 95% CI:1.10-7.19). Conclusions: While benchmark DIDO times were still rarely achieved in the province, we identified several potentially modifiable factors in the STEMI system that might be targeted to improve DIDO times. Our findings that patients who received a pre-hospital ECG were still being transferred to non-PCI capable centres suggest strategies addressing this gap may improve patient outcomes. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Door-in to door-out (DIDO); Mortality; Pre-hospital electrocardiogram (ECG); Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI),"adult; aged; Article; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease marker; door in to door out time; electrocardiography; emergency health service; female; health care quality; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; Ontario; percutaneous coronary intervention; population research; prediction; priority journal; retrospective study; risk factor; risk management; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; survival time; symptom; therapy delay; time to treatment; young adult; adolescent; age; benchmarking; diagnostic imaging; factual database; mortality; patient transport; risk factor; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; time factor; total quality management; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Benchmarking; Databases, Factual; Electrocardiography; Emergency Medical Services; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Patient Transfer; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Quality Improvement; Quality Indicators, Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction; Time Factors; Time-to-Treatment; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85055616583

This study attempts to use machine learning algorithm to predict suicidal ideation (SI) in a treatment seeking veteran population. Questionnaire data from 738 patients consisting of veterans, still serving members of the Canadian Forces (CF) and Royal Canadian Mountain Police (RCMP) were examined to determine the likelihood of suicide ideation and to identify key variables for tracking the risk of suicide. Unlike conventional approaches we use pattern recognition methods, known collectively as machine learning (ML), to examine multivariate data and identify patterns associate with suicidal ideation. Our findings show that accurate prediction of SI of over 84.4% can be obtained with 25 variables, and 81% using as little as 10 variables primarily obtained from the patient health questionnaire (PHQ). Surprisingly the best identifiers for SI did not come from occupational experiences but rather the patient quality of health, signifying that these findings could be applied to the general population. Our results suggest that ML could assist clinicians to develop a better screening aid for suicidal ideation and behaviour. ? 2018 IEEE.",,Canada; human; machine learning; mental disease; risk factor; suicidal ideation; veteran; Canada; Humans; Machine Learning; Mental Disorders; Risk Factors; Suicidal Ideation; Veterans,2-s2.0-85056616352

We examined the relationship between staffing characteristics and residents' quality of care indicators at the unit level in LTC homes. Methods: This cross-sectional study collected data from administrative records and resident assessments from July 2014 to June 2015 at 11 LTC homes in Ontario, Canada comprising of 55 units and 32 residents in each unit. The sample included 69 registered nurses, 183 licensed/registered practical nurses, 858 nursing assistants, and 2173 residents. Practice sensitive, risk-adjusted quality indicators were described individually, then combined to create a quality of care composite ranking per unit. A multilevel regression model was used to estimate the association between staffing characteristics and quality of care composite ranking scores. Results: Nursing assistants provided the majority of direct care hours in LTC homes (76.5%). The delivery of nursing assistant care hours per resident per day was significantly associated with higher quality of resident care (p = < 0.01). There were small but significant associations with quality of care for nursing assistants with seven or more years of experience (p = 0.02), nursing assistants late to shift (p = < 0.01) and licensed/registered practical nurses late to shift (p = 0.02). Conclusions: The number of care hours per resident per day delivered by NAs is an important contributor to residents' quality of care in LTC homes. These findings can inform hiring and retention strategies for NAs in LTC, as well as examine opportunities to optimize the NA role in these settings. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Health care aides; Long-term care; Nursing assistants; Nursing homes; Quality of care,aged; aggression; clinical trial; cognitive defect; cross-sectional study; daily life activity; dementia; disabled person; female; health care quality; home for the aged; human; long term care; male; measurement accuracy; multicenter study; nursing home; Ontario; personnel management; standards; statistics and numerical data; urine incontinence; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Aggression; Cognition Disorders; Cross-Sectional Studies; Data Accuracy; Dementia; Disabled Persons; Female; Homes for the Aged; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Nursing Assistants; Nursing Homes; Ontario; Personnel Staffing and Scheduling; Quality of Health Care; Urinary Incontinence; Workforce,2-s2.0-85054361753

If left untreated, it can lead to deformity, nonunion, malunion, pain, and disability. The purpose of this review was to identify and describe the epidemiology and available treatment options for common avulsion fractures of the upper and lower extremities. Current evidence suggests that optimal treatment is dependent on the severity of the fracture. Conservative efforts generally include casting or splinting with a period of immobilization. Surgery is typically indicated for more severe cases or if nonoperative treatments fail; patient demographics or preferences and surgeon experience may also play a role in decision making. Some avulsion fractures can be surgically managed with any one of various techniques, each with their own pros and cons, and often there is no clear consensus on choosing one technique over another; however, there is some research suggesting that screw fixation, when possible, may offer the best stability and compression at the fracture site and earlier mobilization and return to function. Physicians should be mindful of the potential complications associated with each intervention. ?

In rural areas of Iran, opium use during pregnancy is relatively common among women who otherwise do not have a hazardous lifestyle, which reduces the risk of residual confounding and increasing the possibility to identify its effects. We aimed to examine the association of antenatal exposure to opium with risks of small for gestational age, short birth length, and small head circumference at birth. Method: In this cohort study in the rural area of the Golestan province, Iran, we randomly selected 920 women who were exposed to opium during pregnancy and 920 unexposed women during 2008-2010. Log-binomial regression was used to estimate risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the associations between prenatal exposure to opium and risks of small for gestational age, short birth length, and small head circumference at birth. Results: Compared with non-use of opium and tobacco during pregnancy, using opium only and dual use of opium and tobacco were associated with increased risks of small for gestational age at births (RR = 1.71; 95% CI 1.34-2.18 and RR = 1.62; 95% CI 1.13-2.30, respectively). Compared with non-use of opium and tobacco, exposure to only opium or dual use of opium and tobacco were also associated with more than doubled increased risks of short birth length, and small head circumference in term infants.

The objective of this study was to systematically develop a wound-assessment tool that can be used to assess the early healing of arthroplasty incisions. Methods: The databases MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Cochrane reviews and CINAHL were searched. Articles that described objective assessment of acute incisional wounds were included. Items for the wound-assessment tool were then extracted from eligible studies based on the frequency of reporting. A multidisciplinary panel of wound experts compiled the items into an initial tool to assess key domains of wound healing. The items were reduced through several iterations of panel discussion. Results: Our search strategy yielded 3743 results, which were screened by title and abstract. Thirty-four studies were included in the systematic review for the development of the wound-assessment tool, and 10 domains were extracted based on frequency of reporting.

The objective of this study was to assess whether the status of the mesorectal fascia versus a stage II/III designation can best inform the use of preoperative RT in patients undergoing major rectal cancer resection. Methods: We reviewed the charts of consecutive patients with primary rectal cancer treated by a single surgeon at McMaster University, Hamilton, Ontario, between March 2006 and December 2012. The status of the mesorectal fascia was assessed by digital rectal examination, pelvic computed tomography and, when needed, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients whose mesorectal fascia was threatened or involved by tumour received preoperative RT. The study outcomes were rates of positive circumferential radial margin (CRM) and local tumour recurrence. Results: A total of 153 patients were included, of whom 76 (49.7%) received preoperative RT because of concerns of a compromised mesorectal fascia. The median length of follow-up was 4.5 years. The number of CRM-positive cases in the RT and no-RT groups was 16 (22%) and 1 (1%), respectively (p < 0.01), and the number of cases of local tumour recurrence was 5 (7%) and 2 (3%), respectively (p = 0.2). Rates were similar when only patients with stage II/III tumours were included. Overall, 26 patients (17.0%) received MRI.

This change is similar to the change that occurred when lipid lowering with statins was first shown to have CV benefits, an event necessitating changes in training and the proactive treatment of lipids by CV specialists. As was the case then, many CV specialists currently feel poorly equipped to address diabetes with this new information even though diabetes is common in CV practice. The purpose of this overview is to provide an updated, comprehensive, and evidence-based CV protection plan for patients with type 2 diabetes, intended specifically for cardiologists and vascular medicine specialists. We attempt to elucidate a set of “CardioDiabetes” core competencies by merging the CV-relevant elements of the Diabetes Canada 2018 guidelines within a framework of comprehensive vascular protection as supported by other CV guidelines. We review the rationale for measuring hemoglobin A1C, understanding its use for establishing a diagnosis and for monitoring treatment. We also provide a brief review of the medications most important for a CV specialist to know. We provide useful memory aids and a succinct set of reminders and tips (“ABCDEFR'S”) that can serve as a comprehensive checklist in the clinic and help to motivate trainees and clinicians to consult the original guideline source documents to enrich their knowledge and improve treatment in this rapidly changing arena. ? 2018 The Authors",,"antidiabetic agent; antithrombocytic agent; cholesterol; hemoglobin A1c; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; acute coronary syndrome; atrial fibrillation; blood pressure regulation; cholesterol blood level; evidence based practice; heart failure; heart protection; hemoglobin blood level; human; individualization; kidney disease; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nutrition; physical activity; practice guideline; renal protection; revascularization; Review; cardiologist; cardiovascular disease; clinical competence; complication; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; risk factor; standards; Cardiologists; Cardiovascular Diseases; Clinical Competence; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Hypoglycemic Agents; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85054026120

We investigated whether the presence of the A allele of rs8887 SNP (PLIN4 gene), known to be associated with increased sensitivity to the consumption of n-3 PUFAs, interacts with fetal growth influencing inhibitory control. 152 five-year-old children were genotyped and performed the Stop Signal Task (SSRT). There was a significant interaction between birth weight and the presence of the A allele on SSRT performance, in which lower birth weight associated with poorer inhibitory control only in non-carriers.

While much is known about how the public system operates, little work has been conducted on the private sector, perhaps not surprisingly in a profit-oriented, proprietary system. But it is a massive system with its own agenda, interests, and organizations. In this paper, we address the place of private care governance issues, one seen by government as maldistributed, costly, and controlled by few groups and the medical search for profit. Methods: Using qualitative in-depth interviews, 10 top executive managers of the hospital were asked about its functionality in terms of patient care, profitability, and the practice of governance. Data were analyzed based on themes using NVivo 10 software. Results: The study demonstrates that private hospital functionality finds meaning in board structure, composition and functions, purposeful governance practices as evidenced in well-designed management structures and roles, systematizing governance through the planning of activities, and devising appropriate strategies to deal with both internal and external pressures in the health care environment.

Herein, we report the results of our investigation into the feasibility of a multicentre prospective cohort study addressing the afformentioned issues. Methods: We conducted a 12-month prospective observational cohort study in six ICUs and one coronary care unit in Hamilton, Canada. We included consecutive children and adults following consent for deceased organ donation (including neurologic determination of death [NDD] or donation after circulatory death [DCD]). Intensive care unit research staff recorded donor management data from hospital records, extending from one day prior to the consent for organ donation up to the time of organ retrieval. The provincial Organ Donation Organization (ODO) supplemented these data and, additionally, provided data on corresponding organ recipients. We identified, evaluated, and measured three potential obstacles to the feasibility of a national cohort study: obtaining authorization to implement the study with a waiver of research consent, accessibility of transplant recipient data, and the time required to complete very detailed case report forms (CRFs), with valuable lessons learned for implementation in future projects. Results: The local Research Ethics Board and the ODO Privacy Office both authorized the recording of donor and recipient study data with a waiver of research consent. Sixty-seven consecutive consented donors were included (31 NDD and 36 DCD donors); 50 of them provided 144 organs for transplantation to 141 recipients. We identified the age and sex of the recipients as well as the location and date of transplant for all organ recipients in Ontario; however, we obtained no recipient data for six organs transported outside of Ontario. Intensive care unit research staff estimated that future CRF completion will require five to seven hours per patient. Conclusion: The Hamilton-DONATE pilot study supports the feasibility of a larger cohort study to describe the epidemiology and clinical practices related to deceased donor care in Canada.

Many chronic conditions, including type 2 diabetes, are directly correlated with obesity, and although the benefits and effectiveness of bariatric surgery have been proven in terms of sustained weight loss and improving comorbidities, the procedure is underaccessed and underutilized in Canada. We explored the complex landscape of bariatric surgery in Canada, reviewing the current state and focusing on the volume of procedures nationwide and at the provincial level, the type of surgical procedures performed, their outcomes and their associated complications. Barriers and challenges curbing access to bariatric surgery are also explored. Approximately 8,583 publicly funded bariatric surgeries were performed in 9 of 10 provinces in 2015/2016; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, adjustable gastric banding and biliopancreatic diversion with or without duodenal switch are the most common procedures performed, and coverage varies among provinces and territories. Dedicated bariatric programs have been created and, in some instances, provincial networks have also emerged. Weight loss, resolution of comorbidities and rates of complications in Canada are similar to those found in the literature. The increase in the number of bariatric procedures performed over time has still not met the current demand. The rise in obesity rates, the speed and regional variations in the development and standardization of processes, adequate patient selection, funding and prioritization and gaps in knowledge and attitudes about the merits of bariatric surgery of patients, health providers and policy makers create considerable waiting times and are some of the barriers to better access to bariatric surgery. ? 2017 Diabetes Canada",access to care; bariatric surgery; obesity; standardization,"adult; arthralgia; attitude to health; bariatric surgery; biliopancreatic bypass; body mass; body weight loss; Canada; clinical outcome; comorbidity; dyslipidemia; funding; gastric banding; glycemic control; health care access; health care availability; health insurance; hospital admission; human; hypertension; lifestyle modification; mortality rate; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; patient selection; postoperative complication; practice guideline; quality of life; remission; Review; Roux-en-Y gastric bypass; sleep disordered breathing; sleeve gastrectomy; standardization; bariatric surgery; Canada; comorbidity; complication; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obesity; postoperative complication; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Adult; Bariatric Surgery; Canada; Comorbidity; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Humans; Obesity; Postoperative Complications; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85046371268

Design: Prospective case review. Participants: Consecutive patients referred to a tertiary eye care clinic for an after-hours ocular consult. Methods: Variables extracted from the patient charts included date of referral, age, sex, eye(s) under examination, referral visual acuity (VA), referral intraocular pressure (IOP), the referring optometrist's provisional diagnosis, VA at the time of the ophthalmologist consultation, IOP at the time of the ophthalmologist consultation, number of days between referral and ophthalmic consultation, and the ophthalmologist's diagnosis. Optometrist VA measures were correlated against ophthalmologist measures for left eye, right eye, diseased eye, and nondiseased eye. The independent t test was used to compare IOP measures between clinicians, and the absolute frequency of agreement between localization of eye pathology was reported. Results: After categorizing disease by anatomic location, absolute agreement between optometrist provisional diagnosis and ophthalmologist diagnosis was 60.0%. Strong correlations were found between optometrist and ophthalmologist VA measurements. IOP measurements were reported less frequently by optometrists. In cases in which referral IOP was documented, no significant difference was observed between clinician measures. Conclusions: VA and IOP measurements by optometrists are reliable, although IOP measurements were included less frequently in optometrist referrals.

However, physical activity and global self-worth may also buffer (i.e., moderate) the adverse effect of DCD on internalizing problems. To date, this has yet to be tested. Participants were 1206 children aged 12-14 years [611 boys, 79 with probable DCD (pDCD)]. All children received assessments of motor coordination, physical activity, global self-worth, and internalizing problems. Children with pDCD were less physically active, had lower self-worth, and experienced more internalizing problems compared to typically developing (TD) children (p's < 0.05). Furthermore, the moderated moderating effect (three-way interaction) of physical activity and global self-worth was also evident (p < 0.05), indicating that internalizing problems in both TD and pDCD groups decreased with concurrent increases in physical activity and global self-worth. Importantly, when compared to TD children, increases in physical activity and global self-worth were associated with a greater reduction in internalizing problems among children with pDCD. The findings support several pathways in the ESH and highlight that, in addition to improving motor skills, interventions should also target both physical activity and global self-worth to mitigate potential mental health issues for children with motor difficulties. ? 2018 Li, Graham and Cairney.",Buffering effect; Environmental stress hypothesis; Mental health; Moderation; Motor coordination,,2-s2.0-85053661171

Sustaining KT interventions used to implement chronic disease management (CDM) interventions is of critical importance given the proportion of older adults with chronic diseases and their need for ongoing care. Our objectives are to (1) complete a systematic review and network meta-analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of sustainability of KT interventions that target CDM for end-users including older patients, clinicians, public health officials, health services managers and policy-makers on health care outcomes beyond 1 year after implementation or the termination of initial project funding and (2) use the results of this review to complete an economic analysis of the interventions identified to be effective. Methods: For objective 1, comprehensive searches of relevant electronic databases (e.g. MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials), websites of health care provider organisations and funding agencies will be conducted. We will include randomised controlled trials (RCTs) examining the impact of a KT intervention targeting CDM in adults aged 65 years and older. To examine cost, economic studies (e.g. cost, cost-effectiveness analyses) will be included. Our primary outcome will be the sustainability of the delivery of the KT intervention beyond 1 year after implementation or termination of study funding. Secondary outcomes will include behaviour changes at the level of the patient (e.g. symptom management) and clinician (e.g. physician test ordering) and health system (e.g. cost, hospital admissions). Article screening, data abstraction and risk of bias assessment will be completed independently by two reviewers. Using established methods, if the assumption of transitivity is valid and the evidence forms a connected network, Bayesian random-effects pairwise and network meta-analysis will be conducted. For objective 2, we will build a decision analytic model comparing effective interventions to estimate an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Discussion: Our results will inform knowledge users (e.g. patients, clinicians, policy-makers) regarding the sustainability of KT interventions for CDM. Dissemination plan of our results will be tailored to end-users and include passive (e.g. publications, website posting) and interactive (e.g. knowledge exchange events with stakeholders) strategies. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Chronic disease management; Integrated knowledge translation; Knowledge translation; Older adults; Sustainability,artificial neural network; Bayes theorem; behavior change; caregiver; chronic disease; cluster analysis; conceptual framework; construct validity; cost effectiveness analysis; cumulative scale; depression; diabetes mellitus; disease severity assessment; evaluation and follow up; exercise; genetic heterogeneity; health care organization; health care planning; health care policy; health service; human; interpersonal communication; intervention study; knowledge; life sustaining treatment; medical personnel; medical society; meta analysis; motivational interviewing; priority journal; program sustainability; protocol compliance; public health; regression analysis; research; Review; sensitivity analysis; stakeholder engagement; systematic review; taxonomy; aged; chronic disease; cost benefit analysis; disease management; network meta-analysis; procedures; translational research; Aged; Chronic Disease; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Disease Management; Humans; Network Meta-Analysis; Translational Medical Research,2-s2.0-85053413573

Routinely collected administrative data could remove these barriers. We derived and validated 3 algorithms to identify hospitalized patients with a high probability of pSAH using administrative data. We aim to externally validate their performance in four hospitals across Canada. Methods: Eligible patients include those ?18 years of age admitted to these centres from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. We will include patients whose discharge abstracts contain predictive variables identified in the models (ICD-10-CA diagnostic codes I60(subarachnoid hemorrhage), I61(intracranial hemorrhage), 162(other nontrauma intracranial hemorrhage), I67(other cerebrovascular disease), S06(intracranial injury), G97 (other postprocedural nervous system disorder) and CCI procedural codes 1JW51 (occlusion of intracranial vessels), 1JE51 (carotid artery inclusion), 3JW10 (intracranial vessel imaging), 3FY20 (CT scan (soft tissue of neck)), and 3OT20 (CT scan (abdominal cavity)). The algorithms will be applied to each patient and the diagnosis confirmed via chart review. We will assess each model's sensitivity, specificity, negative and positive predictive value across the sites. Discussion: Validating the Ottawa SAH Prediction Algorithms will provide a way to accurately identify large SAH cohorts, thereby furthering research and altering care. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Administrative health data; Diagnosis; Prediction rule; Subarachnoid hemorrhage,"administrative claims (health care); algorithm; Canada; classification; clinical trial; cohort analysis; female; hospitalization; human; International Classification of Diseases; male; multicenter study; prognosis; register; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; statistics and numerical data; subarachnoid hemorrhage; Administrative Claims, Healthcare; Algorithms; Canada; Cohort Studies; Female; Hospitalization; Humans; International Classification of Diseases; Male; Prognosis; Registries; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Subarachnoid Hemorrhage",2-s2.0-85053374184

Methods: An ethics-approved mixed methods educational needs assessment was conducted in four Canadian provinces (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec), combining a qualitative phase (45-min semi-structured interviews with community-based healthcare providers and key stakeholders) and a quantitative phase (15-min survey, healthcare providers only). Results: A total of 234 participants were included in the study, 44 in semi-structured interviews and 190 in the online survey. Five clinical areas were reported to be suboptimal by multiple categories of participants, and specific causes were identified for each. These areas included: Integration of guidelines into clinical practice, use of spirometry, individualisation of asthma devices to patient needs, emphasis on patient adherence and self-management, and clarity regarding roles and responsibilities of different members of the asthma healthcare team. Common causes for gaps in all these areas included suboptimal knowledge amongst healthcare providers, differing perceptions on the importance of certain interventions, and inadequate communication between healthcare providers. Conclusions: This study provides a better understanding of the specific causes underlying common gaps and challenges in asthma care in Canada. This information can inform future continuing medical education, and help providers in community settings obtain access to adequate materials, resources, and training to support optimal care of adult patients with asthma. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Asthma; Clinical challenges; Clinical practice; Continuing medical education; Guidelines; Mixed-methods; Needs assessment,adult; Alberta; Article; asthma; British Columbia; certified respiratory educator; continuing education; controlled study; general practitioner; health care personnel; human; medical specialist; medication compliance; nurse; Ontario; pharmacist; practice guideline; qualitative research; Quebec; self care; semi structured interview; spirometry,2-s2.0-85052923670

Methods: Two independent samples of women undergoing the menopausal transition completed both the MVAS and the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) at a women’s mental health clinic between 2008 and 2016. Data for the first sample were obtained using a retrospective chart review of patients seen between 2008 and 2012 (N 1 = 75) and data for the second sample came from a prospective study conducted between 2013 and 2016 (N 2 = 86). Internal consistency was assessed using Cronbach’s α and Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to evaluate concurrent validity. Bland–Altman plots were developed to assess the degree of agreement between the scales. Results: Internal consistency for the physical and psychological domains of the MVAS was 0.80–0.81 and 0.92–0.94, respectively. Pearson’s correlations between the MVAS and the GCS were high for both physical (r phys = 0.74–0.76, p &lt; 0.01) and psychological (r psych = 0.70–0.72, p &lt; 0.01) components in both samples. Changes in MVAS physical and psychological scores in response to treatment were correlated with changes in GCS physical and psychological scores (r phys = 0.69, p &lt; 0.01; r psych = 0.49, p &lt; 0.01) in the second sample. Bland–Altman plots indicate low to moderate levels of agreement between most portions of the MVAS and the GCS. Conclusions: These findings suggest that the MVAS has potential for assessing both severity and change in symptoms throughout the menopausal transition, subject to exploring limitations identified in the analysis and application to other populations. ? 2018, ? 2018 International Menopause Society.",Hormonal therapy; menopausal transition; Menopause; visual analog scale,adult; article; case report; climacterium; clinical article; concurrent validity; correlation coefficient; Cronbach alpha coefficient; female; hormonal therapy; human; human tissue; internal consistency; medical record review; menopause; mental health center; prospective study; retrospective study; treatment response; visual analog scale; climacterium; menopause; middle aged; physiology; psychology; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; validation study; Climacteric; Female; Humans; Menopause; Middle Aged; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Surveys and Questionnaires; Visual Analog Scale,2-s2.0-85054166829

This article analyzes how drug advertisements portrayed mentally ill individuals in medical journal advertisements from 14 countries between 1953 and 2005. We argue that a shift in representations occurred in the 1980s: whereas earlier campaigns were dominated by images of the mentally ill suffering in isolation, the post-1980s period was marked by a trend toward ""positive"" imagery, social inclusion, and ordinariness.

About 6 to 8 million people are chronically infected and 10% to 15% develop irreversible gastrointestinal disorders, including megaesophagus. Treatment focuses on improving symptoms, and isosorbide and nifedipine may be used for this purpose. Methodology: We conducted a systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness of pharmacological treatment for Chagas’ megaesophagus. We searched MEDLINE, Embase and LILACS databases up to January 2018. We included both observational studies and RCTs evaluating the effects of isosorbide or nifedipine in adult patients with Chagas’ megaesophagus. Two reviewers screened titles and abstracts, selected eligible studies and extracted data. We assessed the risk of bias using NIH ‘Quality Assessment Tool for Before-After (Pre-Post) Studies with No Control Group’ and RoB 2.0 tool. Overall quality of evidence was assessed using GRADE. Principal findings: We included eight studies (four crossover RCTs, four before-after studies). Three studies evaluated the effect of isosorbide on lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), showing a significant reduction (mean difference ?10.52mmHg, 95%CI ?13.57 to?7.47, very low quality of evidence). Three studies reported the effect of isosorbide on esophageal emptying, showing a decrease in esophageal retention rates (mean difference ?22.16%, 95%CI ?29.94 to ?14.38, low quality of evidence). In one study, patients on isosorbide reported improvement in the frequency and severity of dysphagia (moderate quality of evidence). Studies evaluating nifedipine observed a decrease in LESP but no effect on esophageal emptying (very low and low quality of evidence, respectively). Isosorbide had a higher incidence of headache as a side effect than nifedipine. Conclusions: Although limited, available evidence shows that both isosorbide and nifedipine are effective in reducing esophageal symptoms. Isosorbide appears to be more effective, and its use is supported by a larger number of studies; nifedipine, however, appears to have a better tolerability profile.

A Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to compute and compare the risk of BPH between study participants with and those without hyperthyroidism. Patients with hyperthyroidism exhibited a greater incidence of BPH (18.51% vs 15.53%) than did the controls. Furthermore, the hazard ratio (HR) of the hyperthyroidism group was 1.24 times that of the control group [95% confidence interval (95% CI 1.05-1.46)] signifying that there is a significant 24% increase in the risk of BPH with the presence of hyperthyroidism. This increased risk of BPH with hyperthyroidism, however, failed to remain significant (adjusted HR = 1.11, 95% CI = 0.94-1.3) after adjusting for covariates of age (adjusted HR = 2.72, 95% CI = 2.32-3.2), diabetes (adjusted HR = 1.4, 95% CI = 1.17-1.68), hypertension (adjusted HR = 1.74, 95% CI = 1.49-2.03), hyperlipidemia (adjusted HR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03-1.53), neurogenic bladder, cystitis (adjusted HR = 1.23, 95% CI = 0.58-2.59), urethral stricture (adjusted HR = 2.01, 95% CI = 0.28-14.47), urethritis (adjusted HR = 1.52, 95% CI = 0.72-3.21), and urinary tract infection (adjusted HR = 1.77, 95% CI = 1.31-2.39). After adjustment for comorbidities and covariates, hyperthyroidism was not found to be a significant risk factor of BPH in our male study subjects. Further research is warranted to validate our results and elucidate the association of the pathophysiology of these 2 diseases. ? 2018 the Author(s). Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Markers of immature platelets (IPs), such as immature platelet count (IPC), immature platelet fraction (IPF), and mean platelet volume (MPV) might be useful for identifying patients who have an increase in their rate of platelet production. However, their potential as markers of platelet production has not been rigorously evaluated. We aimed to investigate the utility of the IPC, IPF, and MPV as surrogates for increased platelet production using coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) as a model of enhanced thrombopoiesis. Methods: Daily changes in platelet count, IPC, IPF, and MPV were followed in 45 patients undergoing CABG. Results: The rise in IP markers preceded that in the platelet count. IPC (16% per day increase from nadir) but not IPF or MPV showed a significant and sustained rise, which paralleled the pattern observed with platelet count (18% per day increase from nadir). Conclusions: Of the 3 markers, IPC was the most promising as surrogates for platelet production. Future studies should evaluate the utility of the IPC to identify patients with cardiovascular disease with reduced response to aspirin who might benefit from twice-daily aspirin. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Standard palliative dose regimes typically consist of 2000 cGy to 3000 cGy in 5 to 10 fractions (fx). With the recent advancements in radiation dosimetric planning and delivery, the Juravinski Cancer Centre in Hamilton, Ontario, offers a hypofractionated dose of 2500 cGy in 5 fx for the improvement of pain and tumour control in selected pancreatic cancer patients. This project reviews the safety and efficacy of this prescription. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 24 patients diagnosed with unresectable pancreatic cancer was conducted. Patient data were collected using in-house medical record systems including MOSAIQ, Meditech, and Centricity. Nonparametric data analysis tests were conducted using Minitab17. Results: Nineteen of 24 patients (79%) reported a decrease in pain levels following radiation and 13 of 18 (72%) showed good local control of the tumour on a follow-up CT scan. Around 30% of patients reported nausea and vomiting and fatigue. Only 13% reported diarrhea and 8% reported constipation. Twenty-one percent reported pain flares. All patients were able to finish the entire treatment without pauses or delays. Conclusion: A palliative radiotherapy dose regime of 2500 cGy/5 fx demonstrates a potential for the effective control of pain with limited acute toxicities in patients with unresectable pancreatic cancer. This study aims to indicate the need for further prospective research comparing this regime to other standard treatments in order to determine which is most beneficial for the patient. ? 2018",Acute toxicity; dose hypofractionation; pain; pancreas; pancreatic carcinoma,Article; cancer control; cancer pain; cancer regression; clinical article; cohort analysis; constipation; diarrhea; fatigue; follow up; human; hypofractionated radiotherapy; inoperable cancer; nausea; pain assessment; palliative therapy; pancreas cancer; priority journal; radiation dose; retrospective study; treatment outcome; vomiting; x-ray computed tomography,2-s2.0-85048550855

Self-reported measures included demographic factors, work-related variables, perceived level of activity limitation at work, and presence of work safety vulnerability factors utilizing a novel framework.RESULTS: Reporting a disability at work was significantly associated with greater hazard exposure than those without a disability. In addition, those reporting a disability at work were more likely to be employed in conditions where hazard exposure was combined with inadequate policies and procedures, or hazard exposures were combined with inadequate empowerment.CONCLUSIONS: Work safety vulnerability is one way that health inequalities can be perpetuated even among those with disabilities who have found work. Our results suggest that employers and policy makers need to focus on assessing and addressing hazard exposures and targeting occupational health and safety resources in the workplace in a way that includes workers with disabilities. Implications for Rehabilitation Workers with disabilities experience greater hazard exposure than those without a disability. Those with moderate and severe disabilities reported occupational health and safety vulnerability, suggesting that workplace accommodations should be available to a broader range of disability levels. It appears that, above and beyond standard safety procedures, providing workplace accommodations for people with disabilities may further reduce their hazard exposure and improve their safety.",disability; Employment; job; occupational health; work hazards; work safety,adult; cross-sectional study; disabled person; employment; female; human; male; middle aged; occupational accident; occupational health; Ontario; organization and management; procedures; rehabilitation; risk factor; safety; self report; standards; statistics and numerical data; workplace; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Disabled Persons; Employment; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Health; Occupational Injuries; Ontario; Risk Factors; Safety Management; Self Report; Workplace,2-s2.0-85019682579

The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the reporting of funding in health policy and systems research (HPSR) papers and (2) to assess the funding reporting policies of journals publishing on HPSR. Methods: We conducted two cross-sectional surveys for papers published in 2016 addressing HPSR (both primary studies and systematic reviews) and for journals publishing on HPSR (both journals under the 'Health Policy and Services' (HPS) category in the Web of Science, and non-HPS journals that published on HPSR). Teams of two reviewers selected studies and abstracted data in duplicate and independently. We conducted descriptive analyses and a regression analysis to investigate the association between reporting of funding by papers and the journal's characteristics. Results: We included 400 studies (200 systematic reviews and 200 primary studies) that were published in 198 journals. Approximately one-third (31%) of HPSR papers did not report on funding. Of those that did, only 11% reported on the role of funders (15% of systematic reviews and 7% of primary studies). Of the 198 journals publishing on HPSR, 89% required reporting of the source of funding. Of those that did, about one-third (34%) required reporting of the role of funders. Journals classified under the HPS category (n=72) were less likely than non-HPS journals that published HPSR studies (n=142) to require information on the role of funders (15% vs. 32%). We did not find any of the journals' characteristics to be associated with the reporting of funding by papers. Conclusions: Despite the majority of journals publishing on HPSR requiring the reporting of funding, approximately one-third of HPSR papers did not report on the funding source. Moreover, few journals publishing on HPSR required the reporting of the role of funders, and few HPSR papers reported on that role. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Funding; Health policy; Health systems; Systematic review,"article; cross-sectional study; funding; health care policy; human; publishing; regression analysis; systematic review; Web of Science; cross-sectional study; financial management; health services research; private sector; publication; publishing; research; Cross-Sectional Studies; Editorial Policies; Financing, Government; Health Policy; Health Services Research; Humans; Periodicals as Topic; Private Sector; Research Report; Research Support as Topic",2-s2.0-85051934528

However, there are hardly any reports linking production of research by students at institutions of higher learning to its application in society. We assessed whether and how post-graduate students' research was used in evidence-informed health policies. Methods: This is a multiple case study of master's students' dissertations at Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MakCHS) produced between 1996 and 2010. In a structured review, we applied a theoretical framework of 'research use' and used content analysis to map how research was used in public policy documents. We categorised content of these documents according to the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDG). We defined a case of 'use' as citation of research products from a master's student's dissertation in a public policy-related document. Results: We found 22 cases of research use in policy-related documents (0.5%) out of a total 4230 citations from 16 of 1172 total dissertations (1.4%). Additionally, research was mostly cited in primary studies (95.4%), systematic reviews (3%), narrative reviews (0.8%) and cost-effectiveness analyses (0.2%). Research was predominantly used instrumentally, to either frame the problem (burden of disease or health condition) or select an intervention (treatment or diagnostic option) and rarely symbolically to justify strategies already selected. The bulk of the cases of research use addressed child health (MDG 4), focusing on infectious diseases (MDG 6), mainly in international clinical or public health guidelines, working papers, a consensus statement and a global report. We distilled 'synergistic relationships' among organisations or interest groups, 'globalisation of local evidence', 'trade-offs' in the use of research and use of 'negative results' from the documents and text content. Conclusions: Research from dissertations of post-graduate students at MakCHS is used in evidence-informed health policies, particularly for infectious diseases in child health. Further, we have delineated pathways of research use in the global arena and highlighted the importance of 'negative results' from dissertations of post-graduate students at MakCHS. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Evidence-informed health policy; Post-graduate; Research; Student; Uganda,Article; cost effectiveness analysis; disease burden; evidence based medicine; health care policy; health care utilization; human; medical research; medical student; postgraduate education; practice guideline; public health; public policy; qualitative research; study design; Uganda; child; child health; evidence based medicine; health care delivery; management; personnel; research; student; university; Biomedical Research; Child; Child Health; Delivery of Health Care; Evidence-Based Medicine; Health Policy; Humans; Policy Making; Research; Research Personnel; Students; Uganda; Universities,2-s2.0-85051077238

On the one hand, they are senior public servants who confidentially advise government on public health matters and manage the implementation of government priorities. On the other hand, CMOHs are perceived as independent communicators and advocates for public health. This article analyzes public health legislation across Canada that governs the CMOH role. Our legal analysis reveals that the presence and degree of advisory, communication, and management roles for the CMOH vary considerably across the country. In many jurisdictions, the power and authority of the CMOH is not clearly defined in legislation. This creates great potential for confusion and conflict, particularly with respect to CMOHs’ authority to act as public health advocates. We call on governments to clarify their preferences when it comes to the CMOH role and either amend the relevant statute or otherwise find ways to clarify the mandate of their CMOHs. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Administrateur en chef de la sant? publique; Chief Medical Officer of Health; Chief Public Health Officer; Gouvernance de la sant? publique; Medical Officer of Health; Mots-cl?s; M?decin-hygi?niste; M?decin-hygi?niste en chef; Public health; Public health governance; Sant? publique,Canada; civil servant; government; health care personnel; human; law; medical personnel; note; responsibility; Canada; legislation and jurisprudence; medical director; physician attitude; Canada; Humans; Physician Executives; Physician's Role,2-s2.0-85054774392

The development of an extension of the CONsolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement for RCTs using cohorts and routinely collected health data is being undertaken with the goal of improving reporting quality by setting standards early in the process of uptake of these designs. To develop this extension to the CONSORT statement, a scoping review will be conducted to identify potential modifications or clarifications of existing reporting guideline items, as well as additional items needed for reporting RCTs using cohorts and routinely collected health data. Methods and analysis In separate searches, we will seek publications on methods or reporting or that describe protocols or results from RCTs using cohorts, registries, electronic health records and administrative databases. Data sources will include Medline and the Cochrane Methodology Register. For each of the four main types of RCTs using cohorts and routinely collected health data, separately, two investigators will independently review included publications to extract potential checklist items. A potential item will either modify an existing CONSORT 2010, Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology or REporting of studies Conducted using Observational Routinely collected health Data item or will be proposed as a new item. Additionally, we will identify examples of good reporting in RCTs using cohorts and routinely collected health data. Ethics and dissemination The proposed scoping review will help guide the development of the CONSORT extension statement for RCTs conducted using cohorts and routinely collected health data. ?

The school environment represents an important domain for advancing health policy among youth populations. This study examines the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policies on student e-cigarette use in the context of a natural experiment. METHODS Using three years of longitudinal student and school level data (2013/2014 to 2015/2016), from a sample of 69 secondary schools in Ontario, Canada, a generalized estimating equation approach examined the impact of school-based e-cigarette control policy changes on the prevalence of youth e-cigarette use. The main outcome of interest was current e-cigarette use, while covariates included age, gender, ethnicity, and amount of spending money in dollars per week the student has. Tests of proportion (t-tests) were used to examine whether there were any significant differences in the changes for each intervention school relative to the sample of schools that report no changes in school-level e-cigarette control policies. RESULTS Estimates from the generalized estimating equation approach suggest that students had lower odds of using e-cigarettes in schools where an e-cigarette control policy was implemented. That is, the e-cigarette control policy decreased the adjusted odds of being an e-cigarette user (OR=0.68; 95% CI: 0.48–0.97). Examining school-specific impact, at four of six schools that had an e-cigarette control policy, the ban on the use of e-cigarettes may have lowered the prevalence of e-cigarette use. CONCLUSIONS This is the first study to use longitudinal data to study school-level e-cigarette use and the impact of e-cigarette control policy. These results provide new evidence that school-level policies banning the use of e-cigarettes on school property may be effective in reducing e-cigarette use (or preventing it) in their current form, as seen in this natural experiment. ? 2018 Milicic S.",Electronic cigarettes; Interventional evaluation; Natural experiment; School-based policies and programs; Youth,article; controlled study; ethnicity; female; gender; high school; human; juvenile; male; money; Ontario; prevalence; student; vaping,2-s2.0-85052739723

We aimed to evaluate the etiology and prognosis of NOH within 1 month after LT. Methods: The data of 3339 adult patients who underwent primary LT from donation after citizen death between January 2010 and June 2016 were extracted from China Liver Transplant Registry database and analyzed. NOH was defined as fasting blood glucose ?7.0 mmol/L confirmed on at least two occasions within the first post-transplant month with or without hypoglycemic agent. Results: Of 3339 liver recipients, 1416 (42.4%) developed NOH. Recipients with NOH had higher incidence of post-transplant complications such as graft and kidney failure, infection, biliary stricture, cholangitis, and tumor recurrence in a glucose concentration-dependent manner as compared to non-NOH recipients (P < 0.05). The independent risk factors of NOH were donor warm ischemic time >10 min, cold ischemic time >10 h, anhepatic time >60 min, recipient model for end-stage liver disease score >30, moderate ascites and corticosteroid usage (P < 0.05). Liver enzymes (alanine aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase) on post-transplant day 7 significantly correlated with NOH (P < 0.001). Conclusions: NOH leads to increased morbidity and mortality in liver recipients. Close surveillance and tight control of blood glucose are desiderated immediately following LT particularly in those with delayed graft function and receiving corticosteroid. Strategic targeting graft ischemic injury may help maintain glucose homeostasis. ? 2018",Homeostasis; Ischemic injury; Liver transplantation; New-onset hyperglycemia; Surveillance,alanine aminotransferase; corticosteroid; gamma glutamyltransferase; antidiabetic agent; biological marker; corticosteroid; immunosuppressive agent; acute graft rejection; adult; alanine aminotransferase blood level; Article; ascites; cholangitis; cholestasis; cold ischemia; controlled study; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease severity; donor; drug use; fasting; female; follow up; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; glucose blood level; glycemic control; graft failure; graft recipient; human; hyperglycemia; incidence; kidney failure; liver cell carcinoma; liver transplantation; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; Model For End Stage Liver Disease Score; overall survival; postoperative infection; prognosis; risk factor; sensitivity and specificity; survival rate; tumor recurrence; blood; China; delayed graft function; graft survival; hyperglycemia; liver transplantation; metabolism; middle aged; mortality; register; risk factor; time factor; treatment outcome; young adult; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Adult; Biomarkers; Blood Glucose; China; Delayed Graft Function; Female; Graft Survival; Humans; Hyperglycemia; Hypoglycemic Agents; Immunosuppressive Agents; Liver Transplantation; Male; Middle Aged; Registries; Risk Factors; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85051393686

Due to its rarity, evidence regarding postoperative surveillance is lacking. The objective of this study was to develop a post-radical nephroureterectomy (RNU) surveillance protocol based on recurrence patterns in a large, multi-institutional cohort of patients. Methods: Retrospective clinical and pathological data were collected from 1029 patients undergoing RNU over a 15-year period (1994-2009) at 10 Canadian academic institutions. A multivariable model was used to identify prognostic clinicopathological factors, which were then used to define risk categories. Risk-based surveillance guidelines were proposed based on actual recurrence patterns. Results: Overall, 555 (49.9%) patients developed recurrence, including 289 (25.9%) in the urothelium and 266 (23.9%) with loco-regional and distant recurrences. Based on multivariable analysis, three risk groups were identified: 1) low-risk patients with pTa-T1, pN0 disease, and no adverse histological features (high tumour grade, lymphovascular invasion [LVI], tumour multifocality); 2) intermediate-risk patients with pTa-T1, pN0 disease with one or more of the adverse histological features; and 3) high-risk patients with a ?pT2 tumour and/or nodal involvement. Low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients were free of urothelial recurrence at three years in 72%, 66%, and 63%, respectively, and free of regional/distant recurrence in 93%, 87%, and 62%, respectively. The risks of loco-regional and distant recurrences (p<0.0001) and time to death (p<0.0001) were significantly different between the low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients. Conclusions: Based on recurrence patterns in a large, multicentre patient cohort, we have proposed an evidence-based, risk-adapted post-RNU surveillance protocol. ? 2018 Canadian Urological Association.",,adult; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; disease surveillance; female; high risk patient; human; intermediate risk patient; low risk patient; major clinical study; male; nephroureterectomy; practice guideline; radical nephroureterectomy; recurrence risk; retrospective study; transitional cell carcinoma; urothelium,2-s2.0-85051196094

The complex interactions between HIV-1 and the female genital tract (FGT) and the mechanisms regulating susceptibility in women remain incompletely understood. In this review, we focus on the current understanding of the acute events that occur in the FGT following HIV-1 exposure with a particular focus on the effect of endogenous and exogenous sex hormones on HIV-1 susceptibility.

A sub-study of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of hydrocortisone vs. placebo in pediatric septic shock conducted in seven academic pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in Canada on children aged newborn to 17 years. Thirty children with septic shock had serum sent for TC and FC measurement within 6 h of meeting the study eligibility criteria.

While the success of this model of health care delivered through Family Health Teams (FHT) has been established, evidence based guidelines to guide mental health therapists regarding the number of sessions needed to treat common issues such as depression and anxiety seen within this model is lacking. The goal of this study was to gain a better understanding of how therapists conducted therapy, including type of intervention, under a physician determined eight session cap. Questionnaires completed by the therapists after the first session and again when therapy ended, a focus group and a chart review were conducted over an eight month period involving a total of 147 patients. Several key findings were identified including the unanticipated outcome of a discrepancy between how many sessions were initially thought to be required by the mental health therapist compared to how many sessions were determined helpful by the patient. Conversely, it was also identified that eight sessions was insufficient to treat more severe mental health issues such as trauma. Such results suggest that the treatment of mental health issues within Family Health remains a little understood and explored issue, with the authors suggesting better ways of negotiating session caps reflective of mental health issues addressed within this model of care. ? 2018 Taylor & Francis.",discrepancies; mental health; Primary care; social work; therapy,,2-s2.0-85043387860

However, population-wide implementation of testing remains a challenge. We developed a knowledge translation intervention to improve understanding among diagnostic specialists about molecular testing and appropriate diagnostic sampling in lung cancer. Methods: Specialty-specific education programs were developed from existing literature and input from Canadian leaders in lung pathology, respirology, interventional radiology, thoracic surgery, radiation oncology, and medical oncology. The programs, including key messages, review of current data, existing guidelines, group discussion, and participant feedback, were administered at provincial and national specialty meetings. Participant knowledge was assessed before and after the intervention by using anonymous questionnaires. Molecular (EGFR) testing rates in Ontario were also evaluated before and after the intervention period. Results: Ten programs were administered to diagnostic specialists, including respirologists, pathologists, thoracic surgeons, radiologists, radiation oncologists, and medical oncologists, with completion of 255 preintervention and 219 postintervention surveys. At baseline, 30% were unsure of tissue handling methods for molecular testing, 20% chose an incorrect technique, and half were unfamiliar with how to initiate testing. After intervention, specialist knowledge improved regarding tissue handling and appropriate fixation techniques and uncertainty decreased from 30% to 2% (p < 0.001). A 12% increase (relative increase 57%) in molecular (EGFR) testing requests in Ontario was observed over the intervention period (p = 0.0032). Conclusions: Significant knowledge gaps exist among diagnostic specialists regarding molecular testing and targeted therapy in lung cancer. This initiative significantly improved understanding of the importance and methods of successful molecular testing and correlated with increased testing rates. ? 2018 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer",Biomarkers; EGFR; Knowledge translation; NSCLC; Quality of care,"epidermal growth factor receptor; tumor marker; Article; awareness; Canadian; cancer diagnosis; clinical practice; education program; EGFR gene; feedback system; group dynamics; health care survey; human; interventional radiologist; interventional radiology; medical oncologist; medical specialist; molecular diagnosis; molecularly targeted therapy; non small cell lung cancer; Ontario; pathologist; pathology; practice guideline; priority journal; professional knowledge; questionnaire; radiation oncologist; radiation oncology; thoracic surgeon; thorax surgery; tissue fixation; tissue section; attitude to health; clinical practice; genetic screening; genetics; lung tumor; non small cell lung cancer; procedures; prognosis; standards; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; Genetic Testing; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prognosis",2-s2.0-85048703993

However, practical details about how to develop home-based teams in different regions and health systems are scarce. Aim: To examine how a variety of home-based specialized palliative care teams created and grew their team over time and to identify critical steps in their evolution. Design: A qualitative study was designed based on a grounded theory approach, using semi-structured interviews and other documentation. Setting/Participants: In all, 15 specialized palliative care teams from Ontario, Canada, representing rural and urban areas. Data were collected from core members of the teams, including nurses, physicians, personal support workers, spiritual counselors, and administrators. Results: In all, 122 individuals where interviewed, ranging from 4 to 10 per team. The analysis revealed four stages in team evolution: Inception, Start-up (n = 4 teams), Growth (n = 5), and Mature (n = 6). In the Inception stage, a champion provider was required to leverage existing resources to form the team. Start-up teams were testing and adjusting care processes to solidify their presence in the community. Growth teams had core expertise, relationships with fellow providers, and 24/7 support. Mature teams were fully integrated in the community, but still engaged in continuous quality improvement. Conclusion: Understanding the developmental stages of teams can help to inform the progress of other community-based teams. Appropriate outcome measures at each stage are also critical for team motivation and steady progress. ? 2018, The Author(s) 2018.",capacity building; home care services; Palliative care; patient care team community health services; qualitative research; terminal care,administrative personnel; adult; article; capacity building; community care; counselor; developmental stage; doctor nurse relation; documentation; female; grounded theory; home care; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; motivation; Ontario; outcome assessment; palliative therapy; patient care; qualitative research; semi structured interview; terminal care; total quality management; urban area; home care; middle aged; organization and management; palliative therapy; program development; qualitative research; terminal care; Adult; Female; Grounded Theory; Home Care Services; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Palliative Care; Program Development; Qualitative Research; Terminal Care,2-s2.0-85046780418

Our aim was to establish a prognostic model by using both donor and recipient variables. Methods: Data of 1,010 adult patients (training/validation: 2/1) undergoing primary liver transplantation for hepatocellular carcinoma were extracted from the China Liver Transplant Registry database and analyzed retrospectively. A multivariate competing risk regression model was developed and used to generate a nomogram predicting the likelihood of post-transplant hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence. Results: Of 673 patients in the training cohort, 70 (10.4%) had hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence with a median recurrence time of 6 months (interquartile range: 4–25 months). Cold ischemia time was the only independent donor prognostic factor for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence (hazard ratio = 2.234, P =.007). The optimal cutoff value was 12 hours when patients were grouped according to cold ischemia time at 2-hour intervals. Integrating cold ischemia time into the Milan criteria (liver transplantation candidate selection criteria) improved the accuracy for predicting hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence in both training and validation sets (P <.05). A nomogram composed of cold ischemia time, tumor burden, differentiation, and α-fetoprotein level proved to be accurate and reliable in predicting the likelihood of 1-year hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence after liver transplantation. Additionally, donor anti–hepatitis B core antibody positivity, prolonged cold ischemia time, and anhepatic time were linked to the intrahepatic recurrence, whereas older donor age, prolonged donor warm ischemia time, cold ischemia time, and ABO incompatibility were relevant to the extrahepatic recurrence. Conclusion: The graft quality integrated models exhibited considerable predictive accuracy in early hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence risk assessment. The identification of donor risks can further help understand the mechanism of different patterns of recurrence. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,alpha fetoprotein; hepatitis B core antibody; adult; age; Article; blood group ABO incompatibility; cancer incidence; cancer prognosis; cancer recurrence; cancer registry; China; cohort analysis; cold ischemia; data base; disease association; donor; female; follow up; human; liver cell carcinoma; liver graft; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient risk; priority journal; recurrence risk; retrospective study; risk assessment; risk factor; treatment outcome; tumor volume,2-s2.0-85046114308

Methods and Materials: An electronic survey (SurveyMonkey) was sent to all 14 provincial cancer centers by Cancer Care Ontario Gynecology Community of Practice (CoP) in 2013. The survey included 72 questions in four different categories: general/demographic, pretreatment assessment, external beam radiotherapy (EBRT), and brachytherapy (BT). Results: Ten of 14 centers treated cervical cancer patients and had a dedicated BT suite. All 10 centers had a peer review process for quality assurance. EBRT technique was a 4-field box in eight of 10 centers. The dose/fractionation for pelvic EBRT was 45–50 Gy in 1.8–2 Gy/fraction in all but one center. Nine of 10 centers used high-dose-rate BT. Only one center offered interstitial BT. For treatment planning, two centers used CT and MRI, five centers used CT, and three centers used orthogonal x-rays. Groupe Europ?en de Curieth?rapie and the European Society for Radiotherapy & Oncology guidelines were used in four of seven of the centers for target volume delineation and in five of seven centers for organs at risk dose constraints. All but one center prescribed and reported dose to Point A. Conclusions: The survey identified areas where practice varied across the province. Gynecology CoP used this information to identify priorities for practice change and implemented several strategies to harmonize the care of women with cervical cancer. This highlights the value of interdisciplinary, grass-roots initiatives such as CoPs to standardize practice in a practical manner that directly benefits patients. ? 2018 American Brachytherapy Society",Brachytherapy; Cervical cancer; Community of practice,"Article; brachytherapy; Canada; cancer center; cancer patient; cancer radiotherapy; Clinical Target Volume; evidence based practice; external beam radiotherapy; female; follow up; health survey; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; major clinical study; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; organs at risk; practice guideline; priority journal; quality control; radiation dose; radiation dose fractionation; radiation oncologist; treatment planning; tumor volume; uterine cervix cancer; aged; clinical trial; evidence based practice; image guided radiotherapy; middle aged; multicenter study; Ontario; procedures; radiotherapy dosage; uterine cervix tumor; Aged; Brachytherapy; Dose Fractionation, Radiation; Evidence-Based Practice; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Ontario; Organs at Risk; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy, Image-Guided; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms",2-s2.0-85045943310

Communicating elevated air pollution concentrations with an air quality (health) index is one an approach to reduce population exposure. The indices translate a cocktail of air pollutants to a single value that can be understood by the general public. People can use the index to avoid activities that will elevate their exposure. Most indices report the health risk for an entire city or large area as a single value. Research into air pollution spatial variability shows that major variations can occur within cities and neighborhoods, so air quality index information, while valuable, may mislead citizens when they estimate their own risk.

Approach and Main results: The current status of in vivo Gd measurement is discussed and is put into the context of concerns within the radiology community. The main techniques are based on applied atomic/nuclear medicine utilizing the characteristic atomic and nuclear spectroscopic signature of Gd. The main emission energies are in the 40-200 keV region and require spectroscopic detectors with good energy resolution. The two main techniques, prompt gamma neutron activation analysis and x-ray fluorescence, provide adequate detection limits for in vivo measurement, whilst delivering a low effective radiation dose on the order of a few μSv. Significance: Gadolinium is being detected in measureable quantities in people with healthy renal function who have received FDA approved GBCAs. The applied atomic/nuclear medicine techniques discussed in this review will be useful in determining the significance of this retention, and will help on advising future administration protocols. ? 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",measurement of gadolinium retention; MRI; neutron activation analysis; non-invasive detection methods; x-ray fluorescence,gadolinium; human; metabolism; physics; procedures; radiobiology; Gadolinium; Humans; Physics; Radiobiology,2-s2.0-85049805952

However, whether such meetings can uphold the integrity of decision-making processes has yet to be explored. This narrative review aimed to summarize the literature on decision making in virtual teams, discuss ways to improve the effectiveness of virtual teams, and explore their implications for practice. Methods: In August 2017, the Web of Science platform was searched with the terms ‘decision making’ AND ‘virtual teams’ for articles published within the last 20?years. The search yielded 336 articles, which was narrowed down to a?final set of 188 articles. A?subset of these, subjectively deemed to be of high-quality and relevant to the work of promotions committees, was included in this review. Results: Virtual team functioning was explored with respect to team composition and development, idea generation and selection, group memory, and communication. While virtual teams were found to potentially offer a?number of key benefits over face-to-face meetings including convenience and scheduling flexibility, inclusion of members at remote sites, and enhanced idea generation and external storage, these benefits must be carefully weighed against potential challenges involving planning and coordination, integration of perspectives, and relational conflict among members, all of which can potentially reduce decision-making quality. Discussion: Avenues to address these issues and maximize the outcomes of virtual promotions meetings are offered in light of the evidence. ? 2018, The Author(s).",Competence committees; Group decision making; Promotions committees; Technology; Trainee promotion; Virtual meetings,coordination; decision making; human; memory; narrative; review; storage; student; systematic review; Web of Science,2-s2.0-85062730840

However, the value of using ACT to improve outcomes is uncertain. This study sought to determine the relationship between ACT and outcomes during percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) treated by unfractionated heparin with GPIs (glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitors). Methods and Results-From the randomized TAO trial (Treatment of Acute Coronary Syndromes With Otamixaban), we analyzed the value of ACT to predict ischemic and bleeding outcomes in the 3275 patients receiving unfractionated heparin plus eptifibatide. Ischemic and safety outcomes were analyzed according to ACT to determine the best threshold. Median peak ACT was 225 s. There was no correlation (r=-0.02; P=0.24) between the unfractionated heparin dose received and the ACT value before percutaneous coronary intervention. There was no evidence of a nonlinear association between ACT and either ischemic or bleeding events (P=0.66; P=0.07). No threshold was found to predict ischemic complications. Conversely, increased bleeding was observed with ACT >230 s with an optimal threshold of ACTs ?250 s (4.53% versus 6.17%; odds ratio, 1.46; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.06; P=0.028). This optimal threshold varied according to access site: ?250 s (6.86% versus 10.18%; odds ratio, 1.57; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-2.45; P=0.047) by femoral approach and ?290 s (2.86% versus 5.43%; odds ratio, 2.24; 95% confidence interval, 1.05-4.44; P=0.027) by radial approach. Conclusions-In the TAO trial, peak procedural ACT ?250 s was associated with increased bleeding risk in non-ST-segment-elevation acute coronary syndrome patients treated with unfractionated heparin plus GPIs. This threshold was increased to 290 s when performing radial approach. ? 2018 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Relevant statutes creating regulatory uncertainty included a new provincial Electronic Cigarettes Act (ECA) with certain sections awaiting proclamation, and a local waterpipe bylaw awaiting approval, which would have prohibited the use of these products in public spaces if they entered into force ahead of the exhibition date. Public health staff had concerns the event would normalize use of ENDS/NTDs, particularly among youth, and also planned to enforce already proclaimed ECA sections, as well as the existing Smoke-Free Ontario Act (SFOA) with regulations applicable to use of tobacco shisha in waterpipes. Intervention: Public health staff contacted event organizers and proprietors to communicate obligations under the SFOA and ECA, as well as share hypothetical implications from pending regulatory changes, including risk of charges for regulatory non-compliance if regulations came into force ahead of the planned event. Outcomes: Following discussion with health unit staff and legal consultation, the exhibition was cancelled. Implications: By directly communicating regulatory uncertainty, a public health unit was able to achieve local health goals. In this situation, public health advised exhibition proprietors of potential event disruption implicated by forthcoming regulatory changes. Subsequent cancellation of the event prevented potential adverse health impacts for at-risk groups. A similar communications approach could be used to achieve public health goals during a period of regulatory uncertainty. ? 2018, The Canadian Public Health Association.",Electronic cigarettes; Hookah smoking; Legislation; Policy; Vaping; Waterpipe smoking,electronic cigarette; hookah; human; legislation and jurisprudence; mass communication; Ontario; public health service; publication; smoking; smoking ban; Diffusion of Innovation; Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems; Exhibits as Topic; Humans; Ontario; Public Health Administration; Smoke-Free Policy; Smoking; Smoking Water Pipes,2-s2.0-85053394336

Although the burden of AF is high in Latin America (LA), little is known about current management of AF in the region. Methods We aimed to assess the consistency of efficacy and safety outcomes associated with dabigatran etexilate (DE) versus warfarin in patients with AF in LA from the RE-LY (Randomised Evaluation of Long-Term Anticoagulant Therapy) trial. Data from 956 LA patients and 17 157 non-LA patients were included in this analysis. χ2 test and Cox proportional regression analysis were performed. The primary efficacy outcome included all strokes or systemic embolism (SE). Main safety outcome was major bleeding. Results LA patients were more often female, had higher proportion of permanent AF and lower creatinine clearance, among other characteristics. Vitamin K antagonist use at randomisation and time in therapeutic range were lower in LA than in non-LA patients (44% vs 63%, p<0.001; and 61.3±22.6% vs 64.6±19.6%, p=0.015, respectively). Efficacy endpoints were 0.91% versus 1.68% for DE 150 mg twice daily versus warfarin, respectively. Stroke/SE risk was lower in LA patients treated with DE 150 mg twice daily compared with warfarin, although not significant (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.18 to 1.62). The annual stroke/SE rates for DE 110 mg twice daily versus warfarin were 1.82 versus 1.68, also not significantly different (HR 1.09; CI 0.44 to 2.67). There were no treatment-by-region interactions for either dose of DE on efficacy and safety outcomes. Conclusion Despite differences in the clinical profile and AF management, the efficacy and safety benefits of dabigatran over warfarin in LA patients relative to non-LA patients are consistent with those observed in the main RE-LY trial. ? 2018 Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article).

Although guidelines support anticoagulation in pediatric CSVT, the role of anticoagulation in neonatal CSVT remains controversial. This case report details the course of a neonate diagnosed with extensive CSVT and concurrent bilateral thalamic and intraventricular hemorrhage. Due to existing hemorrhage at the time of diagnosis, anticoagulation therapy was not administered. Despite coexisting protein C and antithrombin deficiency, CSVT resolved spontaneously, and neurodevelopmental follow-up after 13 years suggests a good prognosis. Although our case had a positive outcome, the association between the use of anticoagulation with concurrent hemorrhage and long-term outcome in neonatal CSVT has not been investigated in prospective studies to firmly guide optimum treatment. Current literature and guidelines for the treatment of neonatal CSVT are reviewed in this article.

This is particularly notable in those with preexisting cerebrovascular disease, which impacts dynamic cerebral autoregulation. In these patients, the increased blood flow to the seizing portions of the brain induced by ECT potentially can reduce cerebral blood flow to ischemic areas, possibly causing adverse neurological events. The authors describe a patient with chronic cerebral ischemic disease, chronic anemia, and major depressive disorder undergoing ECT to achieve remission. The patient developed recurrent focal neurological deficits after each ECT procedure, with neurological recovery within 48 hours post-ECT. Clinical guidelines may need to be updated for the management of ECT patients with cerebrovascular disease who may be at an increased risk of intraictal and possibly postictal regional ischemia, especially in areas already compromised by a prior stroke and/or by reduced cerebral oxygenation caused by symptomatic anemia at risk of ischemia. Research is needed to assess changes in regional cerebral blood flow during and after ECT in patients with cerebrovascular disease, including small-vessel cerebral ischemia, and to evaluate these changes in relation to the location, intensity, and duration of induced seizure. ?

Methods: A Research Ethics Board-approved retrospective cohort study was performed to review all laparoscopic-assisted vs open appendicovesicostomy procedures performed without concomitant procedure in patient with prior abdominal surgeries from January 2000 to January 2015 in our institution. We evaluated the baseline characteristics, perioperative and postoperative outcomes such as operative time, hospital stay, estimated blood loss, complications, and long-term continence. Fisher exact test and Mann-Whitney U test were performed to compare the 2 surgical groups. Results: A total of 23 patients (11 open and 12 laparoscopic-assisted) were included. Baseline characteristics between the groups were not significantly different. Procedure time was comparable (Open median 289 [interquartile range {IQR} 230-335] vs laparoscopic-assisted median 231 [IQR 170.5-284]; P =.090). Significantly lower estimated blood loss and shorter hospital stay were noted among the laparoscopic-assisted group (median 100 [IQR 75-200] vs 50 [IQR 25-100], P =.048; median 6 [IQR 5-8] vs 3.5 [IQR 3-5], P =.029; respectively). Complication rates of Clavien-Dindo class 3 in both groups were not significantly different (6 of 11 vs 8 of 12, P =.68). Stomal stenosis and continence rates were also not significantly different between the groups (36.4% vs 25%, P =.667 and 63.3% vs 83.3%, P =.371). Conclusion: Laparoscopic-assisted approach to create catheterizable stomas among patients with prior abdominal surgeries seems to be comparable to the open technique with the advantage of lower blood loss and shorter hospital stay. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",,"abdominal surgery; adolescent; appendicovesicostomy; Article; bladder stone; clinical article; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; female; human; hydronephrosis; laparoscopic surgery; length of stay; male; open surgery; operation duration; operative blood loss; outcome assessment; perioperative period; postoperative complication; postoperative period; priority journal; retrospective study; stomal stenosis; trend study; urinary tract infection; urologic surgery; appendix; bladder disease; child; comparative study; cystostomy; infant; laparoscopy; postoperative complication; preschool child; procedures; robotic surgical procedure; statistics and numerical data; treatment outcome; Appendix; Blood Loss, Surgical; Child; Child, Preschool; Cystostomy; Female; Humans; Infant; Laparoscopy; Length of Stay; Male; Operative Time; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Robotic Surgical Procedures; Treatment Outcome; Urinary Bladder Diseases",2-s2.0-85045209098

Memory clinic (MC) teams in primary care settings have been established to provide care to people with ADRD. To consider wider adoption of these MC teams, insight is needed into the experiences of practitioners working in these models. The purpose of the current study is to explore the experiences of health care providers (HCPs) who work in primary care Memory Clinic (MC) teams to provide care to persons with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). Methods: This study utilized a phenomenological methodology to explore experiences of 12 HCPs in two primary care MCs. Semi-structured interviews were completed with each HCP. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Colaizzi's steps for analyzing phenomenological data was utilized by the authors. Results: Three themes emerged from the analysis to describe HCP experiences: supporting patients and family members during ADRD diagnosis and treatment, working in a team setting, and personal and professional rewards of caring for people with ADRD and their family members. Conclusions: Findings provide insight into current practices in primary care MCs and on the motivation of HCPs working with persons with ADRD. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Alzheimer's disease; Dementia; Gerontology; Memory clinics; Phenomenology; Primary health care; Qualitative methodology,adult; Alzheimer disease; Canada; ethics; female; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; human; male; memory disorder; motivation; outpatient department; primary health care; procedures; professional competence; professional-patient relationship; psychology; qualitative research; Adult; Alzheimer Disease; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Attitude of Health Personnel; Canada; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Male; Memory Disorders; Motivation; Primary Health Care; Professional Competence; Professional-Patient Relations; Qualitative Research,2-s2.0-85047190096

Methodology: Prospective clinical trial including 116 patients from a tertiary care center at high-risk of disease recurrence following ESS+BUD. Blood samples, microbial swabs, and SNSS/SNOT-22 were taken on the day of surgery (Visit-1) and 4 months postoperatively (Visit-2). Outcomes were evaluated using symptoms and mucosal status as assessed by the Lund-Kennedy endoscopic score. Results: Seventy-five patients (69.4%) attained SNOT-22 MCID or higher. (Mean = 33.4, range 9-75). Objective documentation of recurrence of disease, as defined by combined endoscopic/symptomatic criteria, was noted in 58/116 patients (50%). Revision surgery was associated with a significantly higher rate of disease recurrence (60.0 vs. 28.0%; p < 0.001). Culture for Staphylococcus aureus was associated with disease recurrence, preoperatively and at 4 months post-surgery (p = 0.020; p < 0.001). This was restricted to post-operative cultures in the revision group (10.0 vs. 48.8%; p < 0.001). Other factors associated with poor outcome included intolerance to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) (p = 0.036). Significantly higher Lund-Kennedy scores in the recurrence groups despite similar symptom intensity, emphasizing the importance of considering objective outcome in addition to patient-reported ones. Conclusion: Patients undergoing revision ESS are at high risk of disease recurrence, even when budesonide irrigations are used post operatively. Presence of S. aureus on culture pre-operatively or at 4 months post-ESS is associated with a negative outcome. This suggests that S. aureus negatively influences outcome, possibly via a number of mechanisms, including interactions with the (i) immune system, (ii) regeneration and repair of the sinus epithelium, or (iii) via interference with the sinus microbiome. This suggests that S. aureus may be a simple and inexpensive biomarker for disease severity and indicates a clear need to better appreciate S. aureus on how it contributes mechanistically to disease development and persistence in order to develop targeted therapeutic strategies. ? 2018 Maniakas, Asmar, Renteria Flores, Nayan, Alromaih, Mfuna Endam and Desrosiers.",Budesonide nasal irrigation; Chronic rhinosinusitis; Endoscopic sinus surgery; Revision surgery; Staphylococcus aureus,budesonide; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; adult; aged; Article; bacterium identification; chronic rhinosinusitis; clinical trial; disease association; endoscopic sinus surgery; eosinophil count; female; human; major clinical study; male; nasal lavage; nonhuman; outcome assessment; prospective study; recurrence risk; recurrent disease; relapse; Staphylococcus aureus; tertiary care center; adolescent; child; chronic disease; endoscopy; microbiology; middle aged; paranasal sinus; pathogenicity; recurrent disease; reoperation; sinusitis; Staphylococcus aureus; Staphylococcus infection; surgery; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Budesonide; Child; Chronic Disease; Endoscopy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Paranasal Sinuses; Prospective Studies; Recurrence; Reoperation; Sinusitis; Staphylococcal Infections; Staphylococcus aureus; Tertiary Care Centers; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85047111782

The impetus for this research stems from a body of knowledge that recognizes the inextricable link between housing and health, as well as growing momentum in Canada to reimagine the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples through decolonizing approaches and reconciliation. This paper outlines a number of solution-focused social policy recommendations that emerged from SHSF research findings to Indigenize the creation and management of housing for Indigenous peoples living with and affected by HIV. Recommendations include creating spaces for ceremonial practices and cultural traditions; integrating processes for community engagement and consultation; breaking down silos that exist between health, housing, and urban development stakeholders; and providing wrap around support services from an Indigenous perspective. In advocating for these recommendations, we aim to stimulate a dialog regarding how, and by whom, housing policies and practices can be developed, implemented, and mandated to best support Indigenous peoples living with and affected by HIV and AIDS across Canada and around the world. ? 2018, ? 2018 Housing Education and Research Association.",HIV; Housing; Indigenize; Indigenous; social determinants of health; social policy,,2-s2.0-85049877383

The prognosis rapidly deteriorates from the in situ stage (stage 0) to stage 4. As such, early detection and treatment are key. Case Presentation: A middle-aged patient, who was also a chiropractor, self-identified a small skin lesion using the Chiropractors Guide to Skin Cancer. The primary care physician made a dermatology referral, and biopsy identified melanoma. Surgery was subsequently booked and the lesion was excised with a 5 mm margin. The final pathology report confirmed a diagnosis of melanoma in situ. Summary: As primary contact health care providers chiropractors can play a significant role in the potential identification and initiation of investigations into various possible dermatological disorders including skin cancer.

The aim of this article is to present an updated narrative review of original research articles (case control, longitudinal cohort, and cross-sectional studies) and meta-analyses published in English language journals from January 2013 to May 2017 focusing on general medical comorbidity in BD, including the added risks of iatrogenic factors relevant to the treatment of BD. Recent Findings: We found numerous patterns of association between BD and various medical disorders involving multiple organ systems. One pattern indicated reciprocal increase in the rate of each comorbid condition, such as an increased rate of BD in asthma or migraine, and likewise an increase in the rate of asthma or migraine in patients with BD. A second pattern was a predominantly unidirectional increase in the rate of BD in patients with certain medical disorders, such as multiple sclerosis or cerebellar diseases. A third pattern was a predominantly unidirectional increased rate of medical disorders in patients with BD. One study suggested the potential involvement of genetic mechanisms for the association between BD and migraine. Most of the studies had cross-sectional or retrospective designs, and many relied on analysis of large administrative databases inviting multiple potential biases. Summary: Our review highlights the association between BD and a variety of medical disorders. Further research is needed to elucidate the potential underlying etiopathological mechanisms that contribute to observed comorbidities. The results of this review also emphasize the need for comprehensive screening for medical disorders in BD and for adoption of an integrated model of care to address these complex comorbidities. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Bipolar disorder; Co-occurring bipolar and medical disorders; Comorbidity; Medical disorders,aripiprazole; carbamazepine; lamotrigine; lithium; olanzapine; oxcarbazepine; quetiapine; risperidone; uric acid; valproic acid; acute intermittent porphyria; asthma; autoimmune disease; bipolar depression; bipolar disorder; bipolar I disorder; bipolar II disorder; bipolar mania; body weight gain; cancer risk; cardiovascular disease; cerebellum disease; chronic kidney failure; comorbidity; disease association; endocrine disease; gastrointestinal disease; hepatitis C; hospitalization; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; hypercalcemia; hypertension; hyperthyroidism; hypothyroidism; metabolic disorder; migraine; mixed mania and depression; mood disorder; multiple sclerosis; musculoskeletal disease; neurologic disease; respiratory tract disease; Review; side effect; toxoplasmosis; bipolar disorder; comorbidity; global health; Bipolar Disorder; Comorbidity; Global Health; Humans,2-s2.0-85046624344

Treatment patterns for patients receiving consultation from radiation oncologists in addition to urologists have not previously been described. Methods: We conducted a matched cohort study of men with newly diagnosed non-metastatic prostate cancer in Ontario, Canada. Patients who underwent consultation with a radiation oncologist prior to treatment were matched 1:1 with patients managed by a urologist alone based on tumour and patient characteristics. We examined rates of active treatment (surgery or radiotherapy) within one year following diagnosis. Results: Among 5708 matched pairs (11,416 patients), those who received radiation oncology consultation were more likely to undergo active treatments whether they had intermediate or high-risk disease (88.6% vs. 65.9%, p < 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio 4.0, 95% CI: 3.6-4.4) or low-risk disease (56.1% vs. 13.3%, p < 0.0001; adjusted odds ratio 8.4, 95% CI: 6.7-10.6). This effect persisted after considering age, comorbidity, tumour volume and year of diagnosis. Conclusions: Patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer who receive radiation oncology consultation are associated with a higher rate of active treatment, compared to patients managed by urologists only. Selection and referral biases, and unmeasured confounding such as patient preference must be considered as important factors attributing this association. ? 2018 Cancer Research UK.",,"adult; age; aged; Article; brachytherapy; cancer radiotherapy; cancer risk; cancer surgery; cohort analysis; comorbidity; conservative treatment; consultation; controlled study; external beam radiotherapy; high risk population; human; low risk population; major clinical study; male; Ontario; priority journal; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; radiation oncologist; radiation oncology; retrospective study; selection bias; tumor volume; urologist; cancer registry; clinical practice; middle aged; patient preference; patient referral; patient selection; prostate tumor; risk; treatment outcome; Aged; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ontario; Patient Preference; Patient Selection; Practice Patterns, Physicians'; Prostatectomy; Prostatic Neoplasms; Referral and Consultation; Risk; SEER Program; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85044461446

Objective: To determine factors associated with influenza vaccine uptake among HCWs. Methods: This secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study included HCWs aged 18-69?years, working ?20?h/wk in a Canadian acute care hospital. Questionnaires were administered to participants in the fall of the season of participation (2011/12-2013/14) which captured demographic/household characteristics, medical histories, occupational, behavioural and risk factors for influenza. Generalized estimating equation logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with vaccine uptake in the season of participation. Results: The adjusted odds ratio for influenza vaccination in the current season was highest for those vaccinated in 3 of 3 previous seasons (OR 156; 95% CI 98, 248) followed by those vaccinated in 2 of 3 and 1 of 3 previous seasons when compared with those not vaccinated. Compared with nurses, physicians (OR 4.2; 95% CI 1.4, 13.2) and support services staff (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.3, 2.4) had higher odds ratios for vaccine uptake. Conversely, HCWs identifying as Black had lower odds of uptake compared with those with European ancestry (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.26-0.75) when adjusted for other factors in the model. Conclusion: Healthcare workers differ in their annual uptake of influenza vaccine based on their past vaccination history, occupation and ethnicity. These findings indicate a need to determine whether there are other vaccine-hesitant groups within healthcare settings and learn which approaches are successful in increasing their uptake of influenza vaccines. ? 2018 The Authors.

We have previously shown both individual differences in the size and folding pattern of the principal nucleus (IOpr) in humans as well as in the expression of different proteins in IOpr neurons. This high degree of variability was not present in chimpanzee samples. The neurochemical differences might reflect static differences among individuals, but might also reflect age-related processes resulting in alterations of protein synthesis. Several observations support the latter idea. First, accumulation of lipofuscin, the “age pigment” is well documented in IOpr neurons. Second, there are silver- and abnormal tau-immunostained intraneuronal granules in IOpr neurons (Ikeda et al. Neurosci Lett 258:113–116, 1998). Finally, Olszewski and Baxter (Cytoarchitecture of the human brain stem, Second edn. Karger, Basel, 1954) observed an apparent loss of IOpr neurons in older individuals. We have further investigated the possibility of age-related changes in IOpr neurons using silver- and immunostained sections. We found silver-labeled intraneuronal granules in neurons of the IOpr in all human cases studied (n = 17, ages 25–71). We did not, however, confirm immunostaining with antibodies to abnormal tau. There was individual variability in the density of neurons as well as in the expression of the calcium-binding protein calretinin. In the chimpanzee, there were neither silver-stained intraneuronal granules nor irregularities in immunostaining. Overall, the data support the hypothesis that in some, but not all, humans there are functional changes in IOpr neurons and ultimately cell death. Neurochemical changes of IOpr neurons may contribute to age-related changes in motor and cognitive skills mediated by the cerebellum. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Aging; Cerebellar cortex; Climbing fibers; Hyperphosphorylated tau protein; Lipofuscin; Lysosomes; Purkinje cells; Tauopathies,calretinin; tau protein; calretinin; tau protein; adolescent; adult; aged; animal tissue; antibody specificity; Article; brain function; brain stem; cell death; cell density; cell granule; cell structure; female; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; inferior olivary nucleus; male; middle aged; nerve cell; neurologic disease; nonhuman; Pan troglodytes; priority journal; protein expression; skill; age; analysis of variance; animal; cytology; individuality; metabolism; nerve cell; olivary nucleus; physiology; silver staining; ultrastructure; Adult; Age Factors; Aged; Analysis of Variance; Animals; Calbindin 2; Female; Humans; Individuality; Male; Middle Aged; Neurons; Olivary Nucleus; Pan troglodytes; Silver Staining; tau Proteins,2-s2.0-85035783417

However, a knowledge gap exists regarding which specific joint movements are reflected in accelerometry readings. We conducted a case series intended to enrich data interpretation by characterizing the influence of different pediatric upper-limb movements on accelerometry data. Approach: The study recruited six typically developing children and five children with hemiparetic cerebral palsy. The participants performed unilateral and bilateral activities, and their upper limb movements were measured with wrist-worn accelerometers and the Microsoft Kinect, a markerless motion-capture system that tracks skeletal data. The Kinect data were used to quantify specific upper limb movements through joint angle calculations (trunk, shoulder, elbow and wrist). Correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to quantify the influence of individual joint movements on accelerometry data. Regression analyses were performed to examine multi-joint patterns and explain variability across different activities and participants. Main results: Single-joint correlation results suggest that pediatric wrist-worn accelerometry data are not biased to particular individual joint movements. Rather, the accelerometry data could best be explained by the movements of the joints with the most functional relevance to the performed activity.

Methods: PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Chinese databases WangFang Data, Chinese Sci-tech Journals Database and China National Knowledge Infrastructure, as well as ClinicalTrials.gov, were searched for randomized controlled trials with “levodopa/carbidopa/ entacapone” as keywords. The search period was from inception to August 2017. We conducted meta-analyses to synthesize the evidence quantitatively. Results: A total of 5,693 records were obtained. We included seven randomized controlled trials and one cost-effectiveness study after the screening process. Compared with levodopa–DDCI, LCE improved patient Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) II score (mean difference [MD] -1.17, 95% CI -1.64 to -0.71), UPDRS III score (MD -1.55, 95% CI -2.29 to -0.81), and Schwab and England daily activity rating (MD 2.05, 95% CI 0.85–3.26). There was no statistically significant difference in the risk of serious adverse events (AEs) or discontinuation due to AEs in patients with LCE, and the risk of total AEs was higher in the LCE group (risk ratio [RR] 1.33, 95% CI 1.05–1.70). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of LCE was ?3,105 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained in the UK. Conclusion: LCE can improve PD patients’ motor symptoms and daily living functioning when compared with levodopa/DDCI. ? 2018 Yi et al.",Adverse events; Cost-effectiveness; Health technology assessment; Quality of life; Unified parkinson’s disease rating scale; Wearing off,carbidopa plus entacapone plus levodopa; DOPA decarboxylase inhibitor; levodopa; Article; comparative effectiveness; constipation; cost effectiveness analysis; diarrhea; dizziness; drug efficacy; drug safety; drug withdrawal; dyskinesia; economic evaluation; human; meta analysis; nausea; neurologic disease assessment; Parkinson disease; quality adjusted life year; quantitative analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); Schwab and England daily activity rating; somnolence; systematic review; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; United Kingdom; urinary tract disease,2-s2.0-85045635673

Following natural disasters, ill-prepared foreign responders may become a burden to the affected population, or cause harm to those needing help. Problem The study was performed to determine if international guidelines for foreign workers in the health sector exist, and evidence of their implementation. Methods: A structured literature search was used to identify guidelines for foreign health workers (FHWs) responding to natural disasters. Analysis of semi-structured interviews of health sector responders to the 2015 Nepal earthquake was then performed, looking at preparation and field activities. Results: No guidelines were identified to address the appropriate qualifications of, and preparations for, international individuals participating in disaster response in the health sector. Interviews indicated individuals choosing to work with experienced organizations received training prior to disaster deployment and described activities in the field consistent with general humanitarian principles. Participants in an ad hoc team (AHT) did not. Conclusions: In spite of need, there is a lack of published guidelines for potential international health sector responders to natural disasters.

Methods: In-depth semi-structured interviews with medical doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and occupational therapists were conducted from three geriatric rehabilitation hospitals in Ontario. Qualitative content analysis through an inductive approach was used to identify barriers to and facilitators of outcome measurement in geriatric rehabilitation settings. Results: A total of 20 healthcare providers from different disciplines were interviewed. Barriers are standardized outcome measures that (1) cannot be used in isolation to inform clinical decision-making for older patients, (2) are difficult to complete and interpret in older complex patients, (3) may not be useful for all members of the clinical team and (4) are used for reasons unrelated to patient care. Facilitators are to (1) divide the standardized outcome measure into components that are useful for each team member’s practice, (2) encourage standardized outcome measures as tools for improving daily communication and (3) provide adequate education and support for their daily use. Conclusion: This study revealed important barriers to using standardized outcome measures in geriatric rehabilitation from the perspective of healthcare providers.

(2) To review the literature on pediatric pseudoaneurysms managed with a trial of conservative therapy. Methods: A review of the literature was conducted on OVID-Medline for case reports or series of pediatric pseudoaneurysms managed conservatively (observation or external compression). Only superficial, radiologically confirmed pseudoaneurysms managed conservatively were included. Demographic data, etiology, treatment modalities, success rates, and definitive management for cases where conservative management failed were examined. Results: Twelve case reports of 13 pseudoaneurysms met inclusion criteria. Including our case, the mean age was 7 years and the most common pseudoaneurysm etiology was iatrogenic (57%). Seventy-nine per cent (11/14) of pseudoaneurysms resolved with conservative management, and 21% (3/14) proceeded to surgery due to increasing size, bleeding, or pain. Of those pseudoaneurysms successfully treated conservatively, 18% (2/11) developed a complication. Five pseudoaneurysms occurred in patients with coagulopathies, all of which resolved conservatively. Conclusion: In stable, asymptomatic superficial pediatric pseudoaneurysms, a trial of conservative management and close follow-up is a reasonable option, even in patients with coagulopathies. ? 2018 The Authors",Conservative; False aneurysm; Hemophilia; Neonate; Non-surgical,adolescent; Article; bleeding; blood clotting factor 5 deficiency; child; clinical article; conservative treatment; disease course; echography; false aneurysm; hematoma; human; infant; pain; pediatrics; priority journal; treatment outcome,2-s2.0-85042092095

Recent observational data suggest that supplementation with Lipogen's phosphatidylserine (PS) and phosphatidic acid (PA) complex (PAS) alleviates these PMS symptoms. The aim of this study was to confirm these observations on the effects of PAS on PMS symptom severity within a controlled clinical trial setting. Methods: Forty women aged 18–45 years with a diagnosis of PMS were assigned to either take PAS (containing 400 mg PS &amp; 400 mg PA per day) or a matching placebo. The study comprised 5 on-site visits including 1 baseline menstrual cycle followed by 3 treatment cycles. Treatment intake was controlled for by using an electronic device, the Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS?). Primary outcome of the study was the PMS symptoms severity as assessed by using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP). Further, SIPS questionnaire (a German version of the Premenstrual Symptoms Screening Tool (PSST)), salivary hormone levels (cortisol awakening response (CAR) and evening cortisol levels) as well as serum levels (cortisol, estradiol, progesterone and corticosteroid binding globulin (CBG)) were assessed. Results: PMS symptoms as assessed by the DRSP Total score showed a significantly better improvement (p = 0.001) over a 3 cycles PAS intake as compared to placebo. In addition, PAS treated women reported a greater improvement in physical (p = 0.002) and depressive symptoms (p = 0.068). They also reported a lower reduction of productivity (p = 0.052) and a stronger decrease in interference with relationships with others (p = 0.099) compared to the placebo group. No other DRSP scale or item showed significant results. Likewise, the reduction in the number of subjects fulfilling PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) criteria as classified by the SIPS did not differ between the PAS and the placebo group. For the biomarkers, the salivary cortisol percentage increase of the CAR was significantly less pronounced in the follicular phase of cycle 4 than in the follicular phase of cycle 1 for subjects taking PAS when compared to subjects taking placebo (p = 0.018). Furthermore, the change of serum cortisol levels between visit 1 and visit 5 differed significantly between groups (p = 0.043). While serum cortisol levels of PAS treated females slightly decreased between visit 1 and visit 5, cortisol levels of females treated with placebo increased. For all other biomarkers, no treatment effects were observed over the 4 cycles study period. Overall, this study confirms that a daily intake of PAS, containing 400 mg PS and 400 mg PA, can be considered as safe. Conclusions: Results substantiate the efficacy of PAS in reducing symptoms of PMS. In view of the recent inclusion of severe PMS symptoms (PMDD) in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), the positive results of this clinical study merits consideration of developing the PAS complex as a botanical drug for treatment of PMDD.

However, a large proportion of STEMI patients do not access care through EMS. This study sought to identify patient-reported factors for their decision to use (or not use) EMS. Methods: Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a sample of STEMI patients admitted to a large tertiary care centre between November 2011 and January 2012. Participants were grouped according to mode of transportation to hospital at time of index event (EMS vs self-transport). Participant responses were classified using a published framework (modified for a STEMI population) as barriers or facilitators to EMS use, and compared between groups. Results: Data were collected on 61 patients (32 EMS, 29 self-transport). Mean age was 60.3 (SD 11.5), and 23% were female. EMS users were more likely to have a Killip Class >1 (25% vs 4%; P?=?0.03). Self-transport patients were more likely to perceive EMS as slower (48% vs 0%) and express concerns over resources misuse (34% vs 3%; P?=?0.002), when compared to EMS patients. Patients who accessed EMS were more likely to acknowledge the benefits of EMS (44% vs 7%; P?=?0.001) and were more likely to have been encouraged by a family member to call EMS (34% vs 4%; P?=?0.003). Conclusions: STEMI patient perceptions are a key factor in determining EMS use. Health care stakeholders should target the identified barriers to improve utilization of EMS, and develop strategies to optimize care for patients who do not access EMS. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",barriers; EMS; facilitators; patient perception; self-transport; STEMI,"adult; age; Article; emergency health service; family attitude; female; health care access; health care utilization; hospital admission; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; patient attitude; patient decision making; patient transport; priority journal; semi structured interview; sex ratio; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; tertiary care center; aged; attitude to health; electrocardiography; emergency health service; emotion; environment; interview; patient; perception; psychology; severity of illness index; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; time factor; utilization; Aged; Electrocardiography; Emergency Medical Services; Emotions; Environment; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Male; Middle Aged; Patients; Perception; Severity of Illness Index; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction; Tertiary Care Centers; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85038081713

Methods: Two hundred and eight participants (male: 68.80%; mean age = 81.52 years, SD = 3.37 years, range = 76.00–96.00 years) completed a customized on-road driving task that commenced from their home and was conducted in their own vehicle. Participants’ real-world driving patterns for the preceding 4-month period were also collected via an in-car recording device (ICRD) that was installed in each participant’s vehicle. Results: During the 4-month period prior to completing the on-road driving task, participants’ median real-world driving trip distance was 2.66 km (interquartile range [IQR] = 1.14–5.79 km) and their median on-road driving task trip distance was 4.41 km (IQR = 2.83–6.35 km). Most participants’ on-road driving task trip distances were classified as representative of their real-world driving trip distances (95.2%, n = 198). Conclusions: These findings suggest that most older drivers were able to devise a driving route that was representative of their real-world driving trip distance. Future research will examine whether additional aspects of the on-road driving task (e.g., average speed, proportion of trips in different speed zones) are representative of participants’ real-world driving patterns. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",electronic driver observation schedule (eDOS); Older drivers; on-road driving task; real-world driving; road safety,"aged; article; driver; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; velocity; very elderly; car driving; female; information processing; psychomotor performance; self control; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Automobile Driving; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Male; Psychomotor Performance; Self-Control",2-s2.0-85062613444

Although evidence for their efficacy is not clear, they remain a popular means to detect and react to patient deterioration. This may in part be due to there being no standardized approach to their usage or implementation. A key component of their ability to be effective is the speed of response. Objective: The objective of this review is to evaluate the effect of delayed response by rapid response teams on hospital mortality (primary), cardiac arrest, and intensive care transfer rates (secondary). Methods: This review will include randomized and non-randomized studies which examined the effect of delayed response times by rapid response teams on patient mortality, cardiac arrest, and intensive care unit admission rates. This review will include studies of adult patients who have experienced a rapid response team consultation. The search strategy will utilize a combination of keywords and MeSH terms. MEDLINE and Embase will be searched, as well as examining gray literature. Two reviewers will independently screen retrieved citations to determine if they meet inclusion criteria. Studies will be selected that provide information about the impact of response time on patient outcomes. Comparisons will be made between consults that arrive in a timely manner and consults that are delayed. Quality assessment of randomized studies will be conducted in accordance with guidelines from the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. Quality assessment of non-randomized studies will be based on the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies-of Interventions (ROBINS-I) assessment tool. Results of the review will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Discussion: This systematic review will identify and synthesize evidence around the impact of delayed response by rapid response teams on patient mortality, cardiac arrest, and intensive care transfer rates.

We aimed to determine clinical, catheter, and hemodialysis variables that predict: (i) catheter malfunction requiring recombinant tissue-plasminogen activator (TPA) treatment and (ii) the success of TPA administration. Methods: Clinical, catheter, and hemodialysis variables were collected from a cohort of 559 catheters (141,526 catheter days) in 175 hemodialysis patients (2008-2011). Time to, and predictors of, catheter malfunction were determined for all catheters and primary catheters only, analyzed by Cox-proportional hazard model, multi-variable logistic regression model, and mixed-effect logistic regression models. Success of TPA use was determined immediately, next day, and two weeks after use. Results: Shorter time to first TPA administration in all patient’s catheters was associated with increased body mass index (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.06, 1.01-1.11, p = 0.03) and being of black race (HR = 3.05, 1.65-5.67, p<0.01). Primary TPA administration success at two weeks among primary catheters was associated with increased mean peak venous pressure before TPA administration (odds ratio [OR] = 1.03, 1.01-1.06, p<0.01) and decreased mean of the lowest systolic blood pressure measure for the three dialysis sessions prior to TPA administration (OR = 0.95, 0.91-0.99, p = 0.02). TPA administration success at two weeks among all catheters was associated with decreasing body mass index (OR = 0.84, CI 0.73-0.96, p = 0.01) and having diabetes (OR = 7.19, 1.40-36.81, p = 0.02). Conclusions: Both patient and dialysis predictors of TPA use and success were identified in this study, which may be useful for fine-tuning catheter management protocols to target hemodialysis patients at high risk of catheter malfunction. ?

Aim: This study examined the prevalence, profile and predictors of tobacco use among expatriate and national adolescents living in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Methods: Using a cross-sectional study design (2007–2009), we collected data on the prevalence of tobacco use in 6363 adolescents aged 13–20 years, including current smokers of cigarettes, midwakh, shisha and any other form of tobacco. We also collected demographic, socioeconomic, residential and behavioural data. Results: In the previous 30 days, 505 (8.9%) participants had smoked cigarettes, 355 (6.3%) had smoked midwakh, 421 (7.4%) had smoked shisha and 380 (6.4%) had smoked any other form of tobacco. Overall, 818 (14.0%) adolescents were current smokers, who reported occasional or daily use of at least one form of tobacco in the past 30 days. Results consistently indicated that the prevalence of tobacco use was higher among men than women, regardless of age and tobacco form. Among men, cigarette smoking was the most popular, whereas shisha was the most smoked form of tobacco among women. Being male and ever having used illegal drugs consistently emerged as significant predictors of all forms of tobacco use. Conclusion: There is a need for continued public health strategies and education campaigns to discourage adolescents in the UAE from using tobacco. ? 2018, World Health Organization.

There have been no previous attempts to describe the protocols that Western volunteer clinicians use in managing these patients. Methods: A systematic web search was used to identify organizations operating MSTs in LAC. Clinical protocols were downloaded from organizational websites, and organizations were contacted online to obtain those that were not publicly available. Protocols were analysed qualitatively, and content compared with existing international guidelines. Results: Two hundred and twenty-five organizations were identified and contacted to obtain their clinical protocols, and the content of each protocol was qualitatively analysed. Twenty protocols were obtained, of which 75% (15/20) discussed dyspepsia, 65% (13/20) discussed parasites and 60% (12/20) discussed diarrhoea. The protocols infrequently included literature citations. Conclusion: Gastrointestinal disorder protocols used by MSTs in LAC sometimes neglected important aspects of clinical management that are emphasized in international guidelines.

Background: Influenza-related illnesses and deaths have disproportionately high prevalence among the elderly. Vaccination is an effective tool to prevent complications. Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted with nurses focusing on barriers, facilitators and health care providers’ roles in influencing patients to be vaccinated. Interviews were recorded, transcribed and thematically analysed. Results: Nurses identified that the prevalent barriers were fear of the vaccine's side effects, feelings of good health and technical considerations. Facilitators included ease of access and encouragement from health providers, media and social networks. The health care team was influential in raising vaccination rates through direct recommendation, providing concrete information or leading by example. Conclusions: The health care team can influence patients to vaccinate. Investments in training nurses in the knowledge and skills needed to educate patients, and providing nurses with the necessary resources to engage patients in these discussions may be beneficial. Nurse managers can be instrumental in enhancing nurses’ roles and actions to increase influenza vaccination rates among the elderly.

High mortality rates and advances in the use of life-sustaining technology further complicate communication and underscore the urgency to understand and address these challenges. This review highlights current research with a view to informing future research and practice to improve goals of care communication. Recent findings Clinicians view patient and family barriers as more impactful than clinician and system factors in impeding goals of care discussions. Knowledge gaps about life-sustaining technology challenge timely goals of care discussions. Complex, nurse-led interventions that activate patient, clinician and care systems and video-decision aids about life-sustaining technology may reduce barriers and facilitate goals of care communication. Summary Clinicians require relational skills in facilitating goals of care communication with diverse patients and families with heart failure knowledge gaps, who may be experiencing stress and discord. Future research should explore the dynamics of goals of care communication in real-time from patient, family and clinician perspectives, to inform development of upstream and complex interventions that optimize communication. Further testing of interventions is needed in and across community and hospital settings. ? Copyright 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Struck-by-equipment hazard is one of the leading causes of construction injuries and fatalities. Therefore, the primary objective of this paper is to investigate and provide an effective method of safety risk analysis on struck-by-equipment hazard. A spatiotemporal network-based model is developed in this paper which performs dynamic risk analysis on the struck-by-equipment hazard at both entity and network levels. The developed model performs safety risk analysis in a real-time and proactive manner by considering the spatiotemporal interactions among all construction entities (equipment and workers on foot) across the jobsite. Three risk factors of struck-by-equipment hazards were selected, including proximity, blind spots, and velocity. The interactions of the selected factors between entities are quantified and used to generate the network. Three safety leading indicators - degree centrality, eigenvector centrality, and relative risk score - are adopted to represent the risk levels of individual entities and jobsites. The implementation and evaluation of the network-based model with the three leading indicators are conducted and illustrated based on four simulated jobsites. Accordingly, the derived practical applications for risk analysis and hazard identification and prevention are described. The work presented in this paper enables the quantification and analysis of struck-by-equipment risk for both individual entities and jobsites from multiple perspectives. Further insight into the temporal aspects of risk and the safety performance of entities, as well as jobsites, is gained to proactively identify and prevent hazards. ? 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Construction safety; Dynamic risk analysis; Network analysis; Safety leading indicator; Spatiotemporal interaction; Struck-by hazard,Construction equipment; Electric network analysis; Equipment; Hazards; Health risks; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Construction environment; Construction safety; Dynamic risks; Eigenvector centralities; Leading indicators; Network-based modeling; Spatiotemporal interactions; Spatiotemporal networks; Risk analysis,2-s2.0-85040076585

However, the clinical significance of healed/healing (HH) arterial injury on TAB is not well understood. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical significance of this finding on TAB by determining its association with seromarkers typically predictive of GCA. Design: Single-centre, retrospective, investigational cohort study. Participants: A total of 385 consecutive TABs for clinical suspicion of GCA between January 2009 and January 2016. Methods: Elevations in erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and platelet count were compared between patients with negative TAB, GCA-positive TAB, and HH arterial injury using statistical trend testing. Odds ratios of seromarker elevations for HH arterial injury versus GCA were calculated. Results: Seventy-six GCA-positive, 69 HH, and 240 negative TABs were identified. Mantel-Haenszel tests of trend indicated that platelets >400 000/?L (p < 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate ?50 mm/hr (p < 0.01), and C-reactive protein ?24.5 mg/L (p < 0.01) occurred with intermediate frequency in the HH TAB group. The odds of HH TAB were 3.6 times greater (95% CI 1.5–8.5) with platelets >400 000/?L. Conclusion: HH arterial injury is a heterogenous group that requires treatment in the appropriate clinical setting. From our study, we found that the HH group is intermediate between GCA-positive and GCA-negative biopsy with respect to serology markers only. Thrombocytosis is an independent predictor of HH TAB. With further studies, this marker may be considered when making treatment decisions. Further studies are required to better understand this entity. ? 2018 Canadian Ophthalmological Society",,C reactive protein; biological marker; C reactive protein; arteritis; artery injury; Article; blood vessel biopsy; cohort analysis; comparative study; disease marker; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; giant cell arteritis; healing; human; laboratory test; major clinical study; platelet count; predictive value; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; serology; temporal artery; biopsy; blood; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; follow up; giant cell arteritis; metabolism; pathology; severity of illness index; time factor; Biomarkers; Biopsy; Blood Sedimentation; C-Reactive Protein; Follow-Up Studies; Giant Cell Arteritis; Humans; Retrospective Studies; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Temporal Arteries; Time Factors,2-s2.0-85030760835

Glucose-related parameters in patients with aggressive prostate cancer were compared with 2 reference groups: men of similar age and body mass index (BMI) without cancer, and healthy young men. Acute changes in these parameters following radiation treatment were also evaluated. Methods: Nine patients with aggressive prostate cancer underwent metabolic assessments prior to treatment (baseline), 7 and 33 weeks post-baseline (post-treatment initiation). Baseline measures were compared with the 2 reference groups. Evaluations included: 1) fasting and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) blood samples for glucose, C-peptide, and insulin, 2) fasting blood samples for triglycerides, cholesterols, leptin, adiponectin, IL-6, and TNF-α 3) body composition, 4) nutrition, and 5) physical activity. Results: At baseline, patients had normal fasting glucose concentrations (<5.6 mM; 4.9 ± 1.2 mM) but impaired 2-h OGTT glucose concentrations (>7.8 mM; 8.7 ± 2.9 mM). Both reference groups had normal fasting (matched males: 4.2 ± 0.5 mM; young males: 3.7 ± 0.4 mM) and 2-h OGTT glucose concentrations (matched males: 5.6 ± 1.8 mM; young males: 3.1 ± 0.1 mM) that were significantly lower than patient values. During the OGTT, patients had higher insulin (120 min) and C-peptide (45, 60, 90, 120 min) concentrations compared to the matched males. At 7 weeks, 2-h OGTT glucose concentrations in patients improved to healthy ranges without changes in insulin, C-peptide, IGF-1, IGFBP-3 or other metabolic parameters. Conclusions: At baseline patients with aggressive prostate cancer demonstrated impaired glucose tolerance compared with men of similar age and body size. Following treatment, glucose tolerance improved in the absence of changes in expected modifiers of glucose metabolism. These improvements may be related to treatment. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism",Body composition; C-peptide; IGF-1; Insulin,adiponectin; bicalutamide; C peptide; cholesterol; glucose; gonadorelin agonist; insulin; interleukin 6; leptin; prostate specific antigen; somatomedin binding protein 3; somatomedin C; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; age; aged; antiandrogen therapy; Article; blood sampling; body composition; body size; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; clinical article; controlled study; diet restriction; female; Gleason score; glucose metabolism; glucose tolerance; human; impaired glucose tolerance; male; medical assessment; metabolic parameters; nutritional status; obesity; oral glucose tolerance test; physical activity; prostate cancer,2-s2.0-85008219791

It then reviews and classifies the treatments according to the theory×efficacy (T×E) matrix. The chapter discusses the implications of the review for future research and clinical practice. The community reinforcement approach (CRA), contingency management (CM), motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and behavioral couples therapy would all be considered well-supported, evidence-based treatments in the conventional sense.

For each RCT proposal, two investigators independently identified corresponding publications in electronic databases and trial registries. Teams of two investigators independently extracted details from the original SNSF proposal and, if available, from trial registries or publications. In addition, we surveyed principal investigators about trial costs and additional sources of funding. RESULTS: We included 101 RCTs supported by the SNSF between 1986 and 2015. Most were single-centre RCTs with a median of 138 participants (interquartile range [IQR] 76-400). Overall, 67 (67%) principal investigators responded to our main survey questions. Median total costs per RCT were CHF 428 000 (IQR 282 000-900 000) of which the SNSF provided a median CHF 222 000 (67% of total costs, IQR 40-80%). Most investigators (70%) mentioned additional funding, mainly from their own institution or private foundations. A total of CHF 6.7 million was granted to RCTs that remained unpublished. Funding characteristics were similar to publicly funded trials in the UK. CONCLUSIONS: A third of the total SNSF grant sum spent on healthcare RCTs between 1986 and 2015 did not result in peer-reviewed scientific publications. New SNSF grant schemes might improve publication outcomes but their effectiveness needs to be evaluated.",Clinical trial costs; Early termination of clinical trials; Non-publication; Randomised clinical trials; Swiss National Science Foundation,adult; article; cohort analysis; controlled study; female; funding; human; human experiment; male; money; outcome assessment; publication; randomized controlled trial (topic); register; retrospective study; systematic review,2-s2.0-85041239311

Opioid substitution therapy (OST) is a harm-reduction method used in treating opioid use disorder. While OST has shown to be successful in improving treatment outcomes, there is still a great degree of variability among patients. This cohort of patients has shifted from young males using heroin to a greater number of older people and women using prescription opioids. The primary objective of this review is to examine the literature on the association between the first exposure to opioids through prescription versus illicit use and OST treatment outcomes. Method: An electronic search will be conducted on the EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) databases. Two independent reviewers will conduct the initial title and abstract screenings using predetermined criteria for inclusion and exclusion. Reviewers will then conduct full-text data extraction using a pilot-tested data extraction form in duplicate. A third author will resolve disagreements if consensus cannot be reached. Quality and risk of bias assessment will be conducted along with a sensitivity analysis for all included studies. Qualitative summary of the evidence will be provided, and when possible, a meta-analysis will be conducted, along with heterogeneity calculation. The reporting of this protocol follows the PRISMA-P. Discussion: We expect that this review will help determine whether patients that were initially exposed to opioids through a prescription differ in OST treatment outcomes in comparison to people who used opioids through illicit means. We hope that this review will provide evidence related to prescription opioids exposure and future treatment outcomes, which will aid clinicians in their decisions to prescribe opioids or not for specific populations at risk.

Significant factors impacting the outcome of medical events include limited options for premature return to Earth and mission designs scenarios that include delayed communication with ground control. The high acuity, low frequency nature of medical events in spaceflight mirror those occurring in terrestrial surgical environments. Non-technical skills (NTS), including situation awareness, leadership and team coordination, have been shown to increase patient safety and improve outcomes. NTS are behavioural skills; theorized to act through the reduction of performance errors and unexpected events. This study described an approach to developing a NTS taxonomy and behavioural marker system to support medical event management during future long duration exploration missions. This program is comprised of several stages, beginning with an expert panel prioritizing nontechnical skills and medical conditions for simulation and scenario design. A spacecraft themed simulator was designed, constructed and used to simulate and film medical events deemed most likely to occur in spaceflight. The overarching goal is to create a simulation-based training program for astronauts on long duration space missions, improve outcomes in spaceflight medical events, and reduce the overall health risk on long duration exploration missions.

Community-living older adults are diverse, and the health status of some is characterized by complexity related to having multiple morbidities and possibly frailty. Assessment and management of fecal incontinence in frail community-dwelling older adults with health-related complexity may be enhanced using a complexity framework that accounts for social, environmental, and political contextual factors as well as health/medical concerns. This chapter will explain common problems that contribute to fecal incontinence in these older adults such as impaction with overflow, constipation, diarrhea, and mild to moderate cognitive impairment. It will address special considerations that the advanced practice nurse must take into account including hearing and vision impairment, physical limitations, the physical environment and toilet access in the home, diet and hydration, and the role of the caregiver. The chapter will then discuss appropriate management interventions. Interventions highlight the importance of a holistic approach, client and caregiver engagement and education, and referral to other healthcare professionals and community services. ?

One such report, the International Perspectives on Spinal Cord Injury (IPSCI), specifically describes the situation of persons with spinal cord injury. Against this backdrop, the question arises about how these recommendations can be incorporated into an implementation strategy. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to describe a phased process of developing an implementation strategy for a WHO public health report with IPSCI serving as a case example. Methods: The process to develop the implementation strategy consisted of specific phases each employing particular mechanisms. The preparatory phase was composed of a group discussion to select development mechanisms. The implementation strategy development phase comprised focus-group interviews, as well as of a stakeholder dialogue. Thematic content analysis was applied to qualitative data. Results: The group discussion led to selection of specific development mechanisms. The focus group mechanism allowed key stakeholders to openly discuss implementation goals and processesand impacted the selection of the core implementation group members and the focus of the stakeholder dialogue (SD) discussion.The SD was instrumental in developing a specific implementation strategy based on the report?s recommendations. The strategy consisted of a detailed implementation plan, provisions to coordinate an implementation group and expert guidance. Conclusion: The findings from the current study can inform the ongoing development of systematic, evidence-informed, participatory and stakeholder-driven processes for the development of implementation strategies for recommendations from WHO public health reports. ? 2018 von Groote et al.",Implementation; Implementation framework; Implementation plan; Implementation principles; Implementation strategy; Romania; World Health Organization (WHO),,2-s2.0-85062277701

Multiple publications over the past 15 years have noted that one in three physician-diagnosed asthma cases are not in fact asthma. In this quality assurance project, we assess whether PFT labs in Alberta have policies on post-BD testing, as extraneous and unnecessary use of post-BD testing can lead to wasted staff and patient time and unnecessary expenses to the health care system. Methods: We reviewed, in collaboration with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta and Alberta Medical Association, all PFT labs in the province of Alberta (hospital-based private not-for-profit [NFP] and private for-profit [FP] labs). This health policy study of PFT labs involved identifying the proportions and regional distribution of NFP and private FP labs in the province of Alberta while assessing post-BD policies. Each PFT lab was asked for their policy regarding spirometry and asthma diagnosis from May 1 to August 31, 2017. Results: A total of 92 PFT labs were identified in Alberta, 74 of which were private FP (independent) labs, while 18 were private NFP (public) hospital-based labs. Policies were as follows: (i) post-BD policy existed (and if so routinely performed / not routinely done); (ii) no post-BD policy; and (iii) lab chose not to participate. All 18 hospital labs responded: 10 had no policy; six had a policy or algorithm; one did not perform post-BD testing (exercise testing) and one had multiple testing sites. Of the private FP labs, three had relevant policies and/or algorithm and 10 had none. No information was provided from 61 labs. Access to PFT labs in Northern Alberta was limited. Conclusions: Lab policies surrounding post-BD testing were found to be heterogeneous in Alberta. Low response rates, despite the use of a systems approach and requests in writing and in person from FP labs, were notable. Development of a standardized policy across the province would be beneficial. Further higher-level review of the appropriateness of post-BD use in both FP and NFP PFT labs is needed. ? 2018 CIM.",,bronchodilating agent; Alberta; asthma; female; health care policy; human; lung function test; male; pathophysiology; physician; Alberta; Asthma; Bronchodilator Agents; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Male; Physicians; Respiratory Function Tests,2-s2.0-85061242873

The objective of this work was to design and validate an appropriate neutron irradiation site for producing this medical device at the McMaster Nuclear Reactor (MNR). Initial neutron irradiations resulted in massive damage to the microspheres. Further experiments indicated that this damage was due to gamma heating within the sample, not site temperature or radiolysis.

Frequent users of emergency medical services (EMS) have disproportionately high 9-1-1 call frequency. Evidence suggests that this small group burdens the health care system, leading to misallocation of already-limited health resources. Aim. To understand frequent users’ perceptions and experiences regarding EMS, as well as the driving factors underlying their frequent use. Method. A grounded theory approach guided our qualitative research process. Participants older than 17 years who called EMS five or more times in the past year were consecutively sampled where each participant was contacted in the order they appeared on our list of potential participants for interviews until data saturation was achieved. Transcripts were analyzed to derive common themes among frequent EMS callers. Results. Frequent EMS calls often resulted from chronic medical conditions creating recurrent crisis situations, mental health issues as well as mobility issues, frequent noninjurious falls, and social isolation. Combined with these factors, perceptions of the purpose of EMS and social circumstances also contributed to the creation of complex health issues that influenced frequent EMS use. These findings can advise the development of future paramedicine programs and health promotion interventions. ? 2018 Society for Public Health Education.",chronic disease; health research; mental health; qualitative research,,2-s2.0-85059351347

Knowledge of the levels of ART adherence among pregnant women is essential to inform strategies to prevent or reduce HIV transmission rates, particularly in African settings. Aim: the primary objective of this study was to measure adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among pregnant women living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The secondary objectives were to determine: i) the rate of new infections among children at Mabote Filter Clinic in Maseru, Lesotho whose mothers were enrolled in PMTCT, and ii) the factors associated with non-adherence to ART among pregnant women. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, HIV-positive pregnant women receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT) were followed up to delivery and their children were tested for HIV. We collected socio-demographic information, knowledge of PMTCT and adherence to ART (three-day recall and pill count) including reasons for non-adherence. We also used logistic regression to explore factors associated with non-adherence. Results: One hundred and seven women were included. The mean (standard deviation) age of the participants was 28.2 (5.7) years. Most, 81.3% (87/107), were married, only 9.3% (10/107) had a postsecondary education. Two-thirds (63.6%: 68/107) of the participants started ART because of PMTCT. Only 78.5% (84/107) of the participants had adequate knowledge of the importance of PMTCT. The three-day self-reported non-adherence rate at the first visit was 7.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 3.7, 13.1), but up to 43.4% (95% CI: 35.2, 51.9) using pill count. The most frequently reported reasons for not adhering were: running out of pills (7.5%), nausea (5.6%) and to avoid side-effects (3.7%). Women who were employed (odds ratio (OR) 4.35; 95% CI: 1.38,14.29; p = 0.012) and at a higher gestational age (OR = 1.43; 95% CI: 1.11, 1.85; p = 0.006) were more likely to be non-adherent. Only 1 of the 77 exposed infants was found to be positive for HIV at 6 weeks after birth. Conclusion: We found a higher non-adherence rate for participants with pill count compared to a three-day adherence self-report. However, mother to child HIV transmission was relatively low. Lack of employment and high gestational age were found to be predictive factors of non-adherence. ?

Nonsevere hypoglycemia episodes (NSHEs) are associated with clinically adverse outcomes, lower health-related quality of life, increased burden of disease, and reduced work productivity. Objective. To estimate prevalence of NSHEs and associated economic outcomes attributable to sulfonylurea (SU) versus sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitor (SGLT2i) initiation after metformin over one year for Canadian patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Methods. Risk difference for NSHEs was calculated for SU and SGLT2i from RCT data. Estimation of NSHEs attributable to SU utilization in Canada was calculated from published data. Both direct and indirect costs associated with NSHEs were obtained from previous published studies in literature. Results. The number of patients with T2DM and exposure to SU in Canada in 2016 was estimated to be 1,246,438. The average underreported NSHEs in clinical settings were estimated at 67.7%. Risk difference for NSHEs for SU versus SGLT2i was estimated at 26.7%. Estimation of excess NSHEs attributable to SU utilization versus SGLT2i in Canada was estimated at 130,434 events per year (sensitivity analysis: minimum 80,680 and maximum 624,465). Total indirect costs including loss-of-work productivity and out-of-pocket costs secondary to excess NSHEs due to SU utilization versus SGLT2i after metformin were estimated at CDN$8.6M (M = millions) for 2016 (sensitivity analysis: minimum CDN$5.3M and maximum CDN$81.2M). Conclusion. NSHE, which is a forgotten variable in economic evaluations for healthcare reimbursement models, occurs frequently in real-world clinical settings but is infrequently reported. NSHEs can lead to a significant loss-of-work productivity and out-of-pocket costs. ? 2018 Pendar Farahani.",,canagliflozin; dapagliflozin; empagliflozin; glimepiride; glipizide; metformin; adverse outcome; Canada; Canadian; clinical outcome; disease association; drug exposure; drug utilization; economic aspect; economic evaluation; health care cost; human; hypoglycemia; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonsevere hypoglycemia episode; pathophysiology; prevalence; productivity; randomized controlled trial (topic); reimbursement; Review; unemployment,2-s2.0-85058847014

Objective: To determine the long-term retention patterns of Canadian inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatologic disease (RD) patients, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis, treated with innovator infliximab (IFX) and to assess the impact of year-over-year cumulative IFX exposure on retention in both patient populations. Patients and methods: This analysis used a Canadian longitudinal prescription claims database to measure retention on IFX over a period of 5 years. Twelve-month unadjusted odds ratios of retention by time on IFX were calculated for the overall cohort, and within-group comparisons evaluated differences according to age, sex, region, insurance coverage, use of concomitant immunosuppressant therapy, indication (RD cohort only), and previous biologic experience. Between-group analyses compared unadjusted 5-year retention among the same variables. Variables that were independently associated with longer retention on IFX were identified using multivariable regression. Results: Seven thousand eight hundred and six IBD patients and 2,935 RD patients on stable treatment with IFX were included in the analysis. Sixty-nine percent of IBD patients and 66% of RD patients were retained on IFX after 1 year and 33% and 29%, respectively, were retained after 5 years. Moreover, the probability of being retained on IFX significantly increased with cumulative time on IFX. Independent predictors of 5-year retention included sex, region, and type of insurance coverage among IBD patients and region, type of insurance, prior biologic therapy, and specific indication among RD patients. Patients with IBD were 17% more likely to be retained on IFX over 5 years compared to patients with RD. Conclusion: Real-world Canadian IBD and RD patients on IFX have good overall long-term treatment retention. Previous duration of IFX treatment predicts better future retention, and this knowledge could help inform treatment decisions when patients have been stable on IFX treatment for varying periods of time. ? 2018 Baer et al.",Administrative database; Anti-TNF drugs; Biologicals; Inflammation; Retention,azathioprine; biological product; cyclosporine; hydroxychloroquine; immunosuppressive agent; infliximab; leflunomide; mercaptopurine; methotrexate; prednisone; salazosulfapyridine; adult; age; aged; ankylosing spondylitis; Article; Canada; cohort analysis; controlled study; data base; drug efficacy; drug exposure; factor analysis; female; geography; health insurance; human; immunosuppressive treatment; inflammatory bowel disease; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; medical geography; medical parameters; middle aged; patient compliance; prediction; prescription; probability; psoriatic arthritis; rheumatic disease; rheumatoid arthritis; sex; treatment response; young adult,2-s2.0-85058776383

In an era of decolonization, mass social welfare policies, and the formation of new international institutions such as UNESCO and the WHO, monumental advances were made in both theoretical and practical applications of the life sciences, including the discovery of life's molecular processes and substantive improvements in global public health and medicine. Combining perspectives from the history of science and world history, this volume examines the impact of major world-historical processes of the postwar period on the evolution of the life sciences. Contributors consider the long-term evolution of scientific practice, research, and innovation across a range of fields and subfields in the life sciences, and in the context of Cold War anxieties and ambitions. Together, they examine how the formation of international organizations and global research programs allowed for transnational exchange and cooperation, but in a period rife with competition and nationalist interests, which influenced dramatic changes in the field as the postcolonial world order unfolded. ? 2018, University of Pittsburgh Press.

The proposed model deals with combined modeling of long-term effects (cure rate) and short-term effects (tumor growth) which can be regarded as a Bayesian alternative to the Cox regression and promotion cure rate models when the proportional hazards assumption is violated, such as in the case of crossing survival functions. A simulation study and an application to a melanoma data, using the Bayesian RStan package, are provided to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed model and also to evaluate the impact of cancer treatment over the long-term effect and the progression stage of the tumor (tumor growth). Besides this interesting new biological interpretation of the tumor growth, the model can be viewed as an extended Bayesian version of the destructive cure rate model of Rodrigues et?al. and an alternative to the two-sample semiparametric model of Yang and Prentice. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Bayesian estimation; Cox regression models; destructive random variables; Frailty models; long-term effects; pure-birth processes; short-term effects; Stan sampler; survival functions; Yule process,Bayesian networks; Curing; Random processes; Regression analysis; Stochastic systems; Tumors; Bayesian estimations; Birth process; Cox regression; Frailty models; Long-term effects; Short-term effects; Stan sampler; Survival Function; Stochastic models,2-s2.0-85057304326

Due to stringent safety and environmental requirements, fittings manufacturers are obliged to adhere to commonly accepted industry standards (e.g. CSA Z245.11, MSS-SP-75) and adopt supplementary operators' specifications. Nevertheless, there have been several recent cases where fittings delivered by qualified manufacturers and available through local stock suppliers have not met the specified tensile properties, such that they failed during hydrostatic pressure tests or in-service operations. The issue has triggered concerns of operators and regulators (e.g. NEB SA 2016-01) warning about the use of substandard fittings. Although deficiencies in engineering design or operation beyond permissible conditions could be contributing factors, the root cause of the recent fittings failures was mainly associated with the underlying metallurgy and processing resulting in critically low yield strength and/or toughness levels. Further, existing standards and specifications are not stringent enough to screen out fittings with inadequate steel composition or improper manufacturing parameters. As such, a comprehensive modelling and experimental study has been launched to understand the interplay between the composition, grade, geometry and plant-specific processing parameters of quenched and tempered pipeline components. The experiment entailed plant trials using an instrumented NPS 36” 3D elbow to measure the actual thermal response of the fitting during reheating, quenching and tempering cycles. Data was acquired from 36 different positions on the part in order to monitor any deviations from intended production parameters. Further, the metallurgical behaviour of the base steel plate, in terms of austenite grain growth, continuous cooling transformations (CCT) and temper softening of the as-quenched microstructure, has been established by dilatometric tests and microstructural characterization. The analysis and coupling of these diverse data sets is not trivial and requires scientific-based computational modelling. An integrated thermal-structure-properties finite element model was developed to predict the temporal and spatial evolution of the microstructure and provide a 3D strength map for any as-quenched and as-tempered fitting. This predictive engineering tool aids the selection of adequate steels and suitable heat treatment parameters such that target gauges and grades can be manufactured by a given plant to meet the specified requirements and standards. This paper describes the aforementioned methodology and highlights the challenges associated with the manufacture of fittings; in particular thick-wall pipeline components. Further, guidelines and existing knowledge gaps for improved specifications and standards will be discussed.

Our aim was to use an in-vitro model employing thromboelastography (TEG) to evaluate clot formation as a surrogate indicator of clinical tendency to hemorrhage, and investigate the interactions of plasma at varying concentrations of platelets in the presence of anticoagulants. Methods Platelet-rich and platelet-poor plasma isolated from whole blood were mixed together to obtain platelet concentrations ranging from less than 10- 150×109 platelets/l. Clotting was initiated with tissue factor and measured by TEG. Results Different tissue factor concentrations were required to model clinical clotting profiles for plasma that contained heparin (UFH), low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), or fondaparinux. No tissue factor was required for rivaroxaban or dabigatran-clotting reactions. The time to initiate coagulation (R) was significantly delayed at platelet concentrations less than 30×109/l for UFH and LMWH, less than 20×109/l for fondaparinux, and less than 10×109/l for rivaroxaban and dabigatran. The strength of the clot was significantly compromised at all platelet concentrations in the presence of UFH, LMWH or fondaparinux. In contrast, rivaroxaban and dabigatran compromised clot strength at platelet concentrations less than 10×109/l. Conclusion All anticoagulants tested compromised coagulation at specific platelet concentration thresholds. Rivaroxaban and dabigatran had reduced impact on clot formation at low-platelet concentrations compared with heparinoids, suggesting that the factor-specific inhibitors may be more favorable than traditional heparin-based treatment of thromboembolism in the presence of thrombocytopenia.

Taking an intersectionality lens, multiple individual- and district-level factors are used to identify segments of any antenatal care usage in Uttar Pradesh Objective: This paper seeks to understand the multilevel contexts of ANC utilization. The planning and programming challenge is that such knowledge of contextual specificity is rarely known upfront at the initial stages of planning or implementing an intervention. Exploratory data analysis might be needed to identify such contextual specificity. Methods: Tree-structured regression methods are used to identify segments and interactions between factors. The results from the tree-structured regression were complemented with multilevel models that controlled for the clustering of individuals within districts. Results: Heterogeneities in utilization of any ANC were observed. The multiple segments of ANC utilization that were developed went from a low utilization of 23.7% for respondents who were not literate and did not have home ownership to a high of 82.4% for respondents who were literate and at the highest level of wealth. Key variables that helped define the segments of ANC utilization include: woman’s literacy, ownership of home, wealth index, and district-level sex ratio. Based on the multilevel model of any ANC utilization, cross-level interactions also were obtained between sex ratio and ownership of home as well as between sex ratio and literacy. Increases in sex ratio increased the influence of ownership of home on any ANC, while increases in sex ratio reduced the impact of woman’s literacy on receiving any ANC. Conclusion: We argue that a focus on heterogeneous segments of utilization can help build knowledge of the mechanisms that underlie inequities in maternal health utilization. Such knowledge of heterogeneity needs to be incorporated in contextualizing interventions to meet a variety of recipients’ needs. ? 2018, ? 2018 The Author(s).

Our objective was to identify strategies that pediatric critical care trialists consider acceptable, feasible, and effective to improve the design and conduct randomized controlled trials in pediatric critical care. Design: Qualitative descriptive study using semistructured individual interviews. Subjects: We interviewed 26 pediatric critical care researchers from seven countries who have published a randomized controlled trial (2005–2015). We used purposive sampling to achieve diversity regarding researcher characteristics and randomized controlled trial characteristics. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Most participants (24 [92%]) were from high-income countries, eight (31%) had published more than one randomized controlled trial, 17 (65%) had published a multicenter randomized controlled trial, and eight (31%) had published a multinational randomized controlled trial. An important theme was “building communities”—groups of individuals with similar interests, shared experiences, and common values, bound by professional and personal relationships. Participants described a sense of community as a source of motivation and encouragement and as a means to larger, more rigorous trials, increasing researcher and clinician engagement and maintaining enthusiasm. Strategies to build communities stressed in-person interactions (both professional and social), capable leadership, and trust. Another important theme was “getting started.” Participants highlighted the importance of formal research training and high-quality experiential learning through collaboration on other’s projects, guided by effective mentorship. Also important was “working within the system”—ensuring academic credit for a range of contributions, not only for the principal investigator role. The longitudinal notion of “building on success” was also underscored as a cross-cutting theme. Conclusions: Coordinated, deliberate actions to build community and ensure key training and practical experiences for new investigators may strengthen the research enterprise in pediatric critical care. These strategies, potentially in combination with other novel approaches, may vitalize clinical research in this field.

In recent years, researchers have increasingly used magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study temporal skeletal muscle physiological changes using gradient echo (GRE) echo planar imaging (EPI). These studies, typically involving exercise or ischemic challenges, have differentiated healthy subjects from athletic or unhealthy populations, such as those with peripheral vascular disease. The T* 2 -weighted GRE EPI signal is sensitive to changes in bloodflow and oxygenation in muscle. Furthermore, the signal can be weighted differently by adjusting the echo time (T E ), achieving either blood volume (BV) or blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) imaging. This paper comprehensively reviews the muscle GRE EPI literature to date, with a particular emphasis on studies that have also used other modalities in an attempt to elucidate the GRE EPI signal characteristics. Finally, the systemic and muscle physiological factors that are thought to influence the GRE EPI signal during and after exercise are described. These include temperature, blood flow, blood oxygen saturation, myoglobin, and postural effects. The summary attempts to predict, based on the published literature, the temporal dynamics of these signal-influencing parameters in a hypothetical exercise experiment. ? 2018 by Begell House, Inc.",BOLD; Echo planar imaging; EPI; Exercise; Medical physics; MRI; Skeletal muscle,"Blood; Hemodynamics; Medical imaging; Muscle; Oxygenation; BOLD; Echo planar imaging; Exercise; Medical physics; Skeletal muscle; Magnetic resonance imaging; myoglobin; contrast medium; arterial spin labeling; Article; blood flow; blood oxygen tension; body position; BOLD signal; diffusion weighted imaging; dynamic exercise; echo planar imaging; functional magnetic resonance imaging; gradient echo echo planar imaging; human; magnetic field; muscle contraction; muscle strain; near infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; relaxation time; skeletal muscle; temperature; triceps surae muscle; circulation; diagnostic imaging; echo planar imaging; metabolism; oxygen consumption; physiology; procedures; skeletal muscle; vascularization; Blood Circulation; Contrast Media; Echo-Planar Imaging; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxygen Consumption",2-s2.0-85055982016

Appropriate supervision is one strategy, but various barriers (e.g., institutional requirements) limit the availability of qualified supervisors. Remote supervision represents one potential model to provide supervision that may mitigate the negative impacts of STEGH. This paper reports observed outcomes from a description of a pilot remote supervision program employed in a global health program for Canadian undergraduate students. Benefits for learners included greater confidence and independence, greater perceived effectiveness in conducting their project abroad, and reassurance of remote support from their supervisor, supplemented with day-to-day guidance from the local partner. Host communities reported greater trust in the bidirectional nature of partnership with the visiting institution, empowerment through directing students' work, and improved alignment of projects with community needs. Finally, faculty noted that remote supervision provided greater flexibility and freedom when compared to traditional in-person supervision, allowing them to maintain professional duties at home. Collectively, this pilot suggests that remote supervision demonstrates a potential solution to mitigating the harms of STEGHs undertaken by learners by providing adequate and appropriate remote supervision. ? 2018 Pryanka Relan et al.",,adult; article; controlled study; empowerment; global health; human; reassurance; trust; undergraduate student,2-s2.0-85055566257

We examined whether greater driving distance from a hospital with continuous cesarean capability was associated with a higher risk of adverse neonatal outcome among individuals who were planning to give birth at home. Methods: Using an intention-to-treat analysis, we conducted a population-based cohort study of 11,869 individuals who planned to give birth at home in Ontario, Canada, between April 1, 2012, and March 31, 2015. We used postal codes to determine the driving time from maternal residence to the closest hospital offering level 2 or higher maternity care services (ie, hospital with continuous cesarean birth capability). We used log binomial regression analysis to compare the outcomes of individuals who planned a birth more than a 30-minute drive from a level 2 hospital with those of individuals whose births were planned to occur within 30 minutes. We adjusted for maternal age, parity, gestational age, season, and maternal material deprivation quintile. Results: We found no statistically significant difference in the rates of 5-minute Apgar scores less than 7 (adjusted relative risk [aRR], 1.02; 95% CI, 0.95-1.10; P =.58), perinatal mortality, meconium aspiration syndrome, and emergency medical service usage. Neonates born to individuals who planned to give birth at a greater distance from a hospital had a lower rate of neonatal intensive care unit admission (aRR, 0.6; 95% CI, 0.44-0.81; P =.001). Discussion: We found no increased risk of adverse neonatal outcomes for births that were planned to occur more than 30 minutes from a hospital. Our findings can be considered, along with individual risk factors and contextual factors, in decision making about the choice of home birth for individuals who live more than half an hour from a hospital with cesarean capacity. ? 2018 by the American College of Nurse-Midwives",health policy; home birth; intrapartum care; quantitative research,,2-s2.0-85055345828

In Switzerland, about 40% of randomised clinical trials (RCTs) supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF) were not published. We aimed to describe funding characteristics of published and unpublished RCTs supported by the SNSF, to quantify the amount of money spent for unpublished studies, and to compare our results to a similar study performed in the UK.METHODS: We established a retrospective cohort of RCTs funded by the SNSF up to 2015. For each RCT proposal, two investigators independently identified corresponding publications in electronic databases and trial registries. Teams of two investigators independently extracted details from the original SNSF proposal and, if available, from trial registries or publications. In addition, we surveyed principal investigators about trial costs and additional sources of funding.RESULTS: We included 101 RCTs supported by the SNSF between 1986 and 2015. Most were single-centre RCTs with a median of 138 participants (interquartile range [IQR] 76-400). Overall, 67 (67%) principal investigators responded to our main survey questions. Median total costs per RCT were CHF 428 000 (IQR 282 000-900 000) of which the SNSF provided a median CHF 222 000 (67% of total costs, IQR 40-80%). Most investigators (70%) mentioned additional funding, mainly from their own institution or private foundations. A total of CHF 6.7 million was granted to RCTs that remained unpublished. Funding characteristics were similar to publicly funded trials in the UK.CONCLUSIONS: A third of the total SNSF grant sum spent on healthcare RCTs between 1986 and 2015 did not result in peer-reviewed scientific publications. New SNSF grant schemes might improve publication outcomes but their effectiveness needs to be evaluated.",,"cost benefit analysis; economics; financial management; human; publishing; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; Switzerland; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Financing, Organized; Humans; Publishing; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Retrospective Studies; Switzerland",2-s2.0-85053768889

Methods: Female homozygous RCS (RCS-p+/RCS-p+) and male nude rats (Hsd:RH-Foxn1mu, mutation in the foxn1 gene; no T cells) were crossed to produce heterozygous F1 progeny. Double homozygous F2 progeny obtained by crossing the F1 heterozygotes was identified phenotypically (hair loss) and genotypically (RCS-p+ gene determined by PCR). Retinal degenerative status was confirmed by optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging, electroretinography (ERG), optokinetic (OKN) testing, superior colliculus (SC) electrophysiology, and by histology. The effect of xenografts was assessed by transplantation of human embryonic stem cell-derived retinal pigment epithelium (hESC-RPE) and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (iPS-RPE) into the eye. Morphological analysis was conducted based on hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and immunostaining. Age-matched pigmented athymic nude rats were used as control. Results: Approximately 6% of the F2 pups (11/172) were homozygous for RCS-p+ gene and Foxn1mu gene. Homozygous males crossed with heterozygous females resulted in 50% homozygous progeny for experimentation. OCT imaging demonstrated significant loss of retinal thickness in homozygous rats. H&amp;E staining showed photoreceptor thickness reduced to 1–3 layers at 12?weeks of age. Progressive loss of visual function was evidenced by OKN testing, ERG, and SC electrophysiology. Transplantation experiments demonstrated survival of human-derived cells and absence of apparent immune rejection. Conclusions: This new rat animal model developed by crossing RCS rats and athymic nude rats is suitable for conducting retinal transplantation experiments involving xenografts. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Human-derived cells; Immunodeficiency; Retinal dystrophy; Retinal transplantation,"protein kinase Mer; animal; cell survival; disease model; electroretinography; female; genetics; genotyping technique; graft survival; human; human embryonic stem cell; immune deficiency; induced pluripotent stem cell; male; nude rat; optical coherence tomography; pathophysiology; phenotype; physiology; rat; retina; retina dystrophy; retinal pigment epithelium; transplantation; Animals; c-Mer Tyrosine Kinase; Cell Survival; Disease Models, Animal; Electroretinography; Female; Genotyping Techniques; Graft Survival; Human Embryonic Stem Cells; Humans; Immunologic Deficiency Syndromes; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Male; Phenotype; Rats; Rats, Nude; Retina; Retinal Dystrophies; Retinal Pigment Epithelium; Tomography, Optical Coherence",2-s2.0-85053451307

Utilizing a multiplex assay, we aimed to examine the phosphorylation status of key mTORC-1-related signalling molecules in response to protein feeding and resistance exercise. Eight healthy men (age, 22.5 ± 3.1 years; mass, 80 ± 9 kg; 1-repetition maximum leg extension, 87 ± 5 kg) performed 4 sets of unilateral leg extensions until volitional failure. Immediately following the final set, all participants consumed a protein-enriched beverage. A single skeletal muscle biopsy was obtained from the vastus lateralis before (Pre) with further bilateral biopsies at 1 h (1 h exercised legs (FEDEX) and 1 h nonexercised legs (FED)) and 3 h (3 h FEDEX and 3 h FED) after drink ingestion. Phosphorylated AktSer473 was significantly elevated from Pre at 1 h FEDEX. Phosphorylated p70S6K1Thr412 was significantly increased above Pre at 1 h FEDEX and 1 h FED and was still significantly elevated at 3 h FEDEX but not 3 h FED. Phosphorylated rpS6Ser235/236 was also significantly increased above Pre at 1 h FEDEX and 1 h FED with 1 h FEDEX greater than 1 h FED. Our data highlight the utility of a multiplex assay to assess anabolic signalling molecules in response to protein feeding and resistance exercise in humans.

Moves between care settings may be required as health deteriorates. However, in some cases, care setting transitions may have little to do with end-of-life care needs and instead reflect the needs, demands, availability, or funding provisions of the country or funding body and organizations providing care. This paper is a scoping review of the international peer-reviewed research literature to gain evidence on the frequency and types of end-of-life care setting transitions, and the reasons for these moves. Methods: All relevant print and open access research articles published in 2000+ were sought using the Directory of Open Access Journals and EBSCO Discovery Host. Results: A total of 39 research articles were identified and reviewed. However, minimal useful evidence was revealed. Most articles focused solely on hospital admissions near death, and some focused on nursing home admissions, with other moves infrequently studied. Conclusions: This review demonstrates the need to quantify and justify end-of-life care setting transitions as it appears dying people are frequently moved, often as death nears. This research is needed to distinguish transitions related to end-of-life care needs and those arising from pressures on or from care providers and others unrelated to the person’s care needs. ?

This study aims to compare three SoF table formats in terms of understanding, accessibility, satisfaction and preference with systematic review users. Methods The primary objective of this three-arm randomised controlled non-inferiority trial is to investigate whether an alternative Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) SoF table or Evidence-based Practice Center SoF table is non-inferior to the current GRADE SoF table in the understanding of the information presented to systematic review users, particularly for descriptive findings. Researchers, clinical practice guideline developers, policy-makers or knowledge transfer professionals will be recruited. Data will be collected electronically at baseline and after randomisation. Non-inferiority would be declared if the difference in the proportion of participants who understand the information displayed in the alternative SoF table is 10% or less.

In adults, impaired MetFlex is associated with insulin resistance (IR), which can be improved with as little as 7 days of exercise. Whether this occurs similarly in children is unknown. We hypothesized that 7 consecutive days of exercise would improve MetFlex and IR in children with obesity. Twelve children (8 boys, 4 girls) completed 2 study visits before (PRE) and 2 study visits after (POST) exercise training. At visit 1, fasting blood was collected, and anthro-pometry and maximal oxygen uptake were assessed. At visit 2, a13C-enriched CHO drink was ingested before exercise (3 × 20 min) at B59% maximal oxygen uptake. Exogenous CHO oxidative efficiency, used as a surrogate measurement of MetFlex, was calculated from breath samples. During training, participants alternated between continuous and high-intensity interval cycling sessions at home under supervision. In spite of good training adherence, there was no improvement in MetFlex (PRE: 20.7% ± 1.8%, POST: 18.9% ± 4.9%, p = 0.22) or homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (PRE: 8.7 ± 4.6, POST: 8.1 ± 6.0, p = 0.51).

The aim of this study was to quantify the extent to which healthcare seekers perceive difficulties in communicating their GI symptoms to HCPs. Interviews were conducted in two settings where individuals were expected to acknowledge experiencing GI symptoms: a tertiary-care, ambulatory GI clinic and the digestive health medication area of a large retail pharmacy. A 13-item questionnaire was designed to identify subjects’ perceptions of the component stages of a symptom communication process. Surveys were completed by 100 participants, 50 from the clinic and 50 from the pharmacy. Most participants reported that it was difficult to know if their symptom descriptions had been understood (clinic: 68%; pharmacy: 86%), that difficulty in describing symptoms hampered access to healthcare (clinic: 82%; pharmacy: 76%), and that use of different descriptors (e.g., icons) would facilitate symptom reporting (clinic: 90%; pharmacy: 98%). Apart from difficulties in selecting a standard term and in providing a specific description for their symptoms, perceived barriers to communicating symptoms did not differ between the clinic and pharmacy settings. Most individuals with GI symptoms perceive difficulty in communicating their symptoms to healthcare professionals.

Sanokondu is a multinational community of practice dedicated to fostering health-care leadership education worldwide. This platform for health-care leadership education was conceived in 2014 at the first Toronto International Summit on Leadership Education for Physicians (TISLEP) and evolved into a formal network of collaborators in 2016. Design/methodology/approach: This paper is a case study of a multinational collaboration of health-care leaders, educators, learners and other stakeholders. It describes Sanokondu’s development and contribution to global health-care leadership education. One of the major strategies has been establishing partnerships with other educational organizations involved in clinical leadership and health systems improvement. Findings: A major flagship of Sanokondu has been its annual TISLEP meetings, which brings various health-care leaders, educators, learners and patients together. The meetings provide opportunities for dialog and knowledge exchange on leadership education. The work of Sanokondu has resulted in an open access knowledge bank for health-care leadership education, which in addition to the individual expertise of its members, is readily available for consultation. Sanokondu continues to contribute to scholarship in health-care leadership through ongoing research, education and dissemination in the scholarly literature. Originality/value: Sanokondu embodies the achievements of a multinational collaboration of health-care stakeholders invested in leadership education. The interactions culminating from this platform have resulted in new insights, innovative ideas and best practices on health-care leadership education. ? 2018, Jamiu Busari, Ming-Ka Chan, Deepak Dath, Anne Matlow and Diane de Camps Meschino.",Health care; Knowledge transfer; Leadership; Management; Networks,"achievement; adult; article; consultation; education; global health; human; leadership; organization; physician; cooperation; curriculum; international cooperation; medical director; medical education; program development; program evaluation; Congresses as Topic; Cooperative Behavior; Curriculum; Education, Medical, Continuing; Humans; Internationality; Leadership; Physician Executives; Program Development; Program Evaluation",2-s2.0-85045840392

Self-concept was measured using the Self-Perception Profile for Children and Adolescents. Results: The mean age was 14.5 years and most participants were female (70.2%). ANOVAs comparing self-concept with population norms showed large significant effects (d = 0.77 to 1.93) indicating compromised self-concept among youth receiving mental health services. Regression analyses controlling for patient age, sex, family income, and diagnoses of major depressive disorder, generalized social phobia, and generalized anxiety showed that the inpatient setting was a significant predictor of lower global self-worth (β=-.26; p=.035). Conclusions: Compared to outpatients, inpatients generally reported lower self-concept, but differences were significant only for global self-worth.

Resource-constrained countries have difficulty conducting large EQ-5D valuation studies, which limits their ability to conduct cost-utility analyses using a value set specific to their own population. When estimates of similar but related parameters are available, shrinkage estimators reduce uncertainty and yield estimators with smaller mean square error (MSE). We hypothesized that health utilities based on shrinkage estimators can reduce MSE and mean absolute error (MAE) when compared to country-specific health utilities. Methods. We conducted a simulation study (1,000 iterations) based on the observed means and standard deviations (or standard errors) of the EQ-5D-3L valuation studies from 14 counties. In each iteration, the simulated data were fitted with the model based on the country-specific functional form of the scoring algorithm to create country-specific health utilities (“na?ve” estimators). Shrinkage estimators were calculated based on the empirical Bayes estimation methods. The performance of shrinkage estimators was compared with those of the na?ve estimators over a range of different sample sizes based on MSE, MAE, mean bias, standard errors and the width of confidence intervals. Results. The MSE of the shrinkage estimators was smaller than the MSE of the na?ve estimators on average, as theoretically predicted. Importantly, the MAE of the shrinkage estimators was also smaller than the MAE of the na?ve estimators on average. In addition, the reduction in MSE with the use of shrinkage estimators did not substantially increase bias. The degree of reduction in uncertainty by shrinkage estimators is most apparent in valuation studies with small sample size. Conclusion. Health utilities derived from shrinkage estimation allow valuation studies with small sample size to “borrow strength” from other valuation studies to reduce uncertainty. ? 2017, ?

We investigated the utility of selecting out the squamous cells from sputum using inverted microscopy. Methods Sputum was obtained from fifty subjects, then divided to facilitate parallel processing of paired samples for gram-stain and semi-quantitative cultures, and quantitative cytometry. Results Selective processing under inverted microscopy allowed for fewer sample rejections (2% vs. 24%) and greater culture positivity (58% vs. 24%) compared with routine practices, with significant yield of fungal organisms. While known pathogens were associated with intense sputum neutrophilia, organisms that were not routinely considered as airway pathogens were also associated with modest neutrophilia indicating that they are capable of inducing a clinically relevant cellular response. Conclusion Sputum selection under inverted microscopy improves the detection of bacterial pathogens during infective exacerbations. The methods to assign pathogenicity to microbes in the airway needs to be re-visited by assessing the cellular responses that they evoke in the airways. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Airway disease; Clinical microbiology; Lower respiratory tract infection; Sputum; Sputum cell counts; Sputum selection,"adult; aged; Article; asthma; bacterial growth; bronchiectasis; chronic obstructive lung disease; controlled study; disease association; disease exacerbation; Escherichia coli; female; forced expiratory volume; Haemophilus influenzae; human; major clinical study; male; microbial identification; Moraxella catarrhalis; neutrophilia; priority journal; prospective study; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; sputum culture; Staphylococcus aureus; x-ray computed tomography; bacterium; cytology; fungus; isolation and purification; microbiology; microscopy; middle aged; neutrophil; pathogenicity; pathology; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; respiratory tract infection; specimen handling; sputum; very elderly; virulence; vital capacity; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Bacteria; Female; Forced Expiratory Volume; Fungi; Humans; Male; Microscopy; Middle Aged; Neutrophils; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Tract Infections; Specimen Handling; Sputum; Virulence; Vital Capacity; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85037609415

The purpose of this review was to evaluate the type of studies and the level of evidence (LOE) published in knee surgery, sports traumatology, arthroscopy (KSSTA) from 1995 to 2015. The secondary aim was to analyze trends in authorship characteristics in KSSTA. Methods: Two reviewers reviewed the table of contents of KSSTA and identified original papers from 1995, 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2015. The reviewers graded LOE from Levels I to IV using guidelines from the University of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine. For each article, the total number of authors and country of author group were also analyzed. Results: A total of 880 papers were analyzed. The proportions in LOE have stayed consistent throughout the study period (n.s.). There has been a significant increase in the number of published articles and the number of Level I and II studies (P < 0.01). Therapeutic articles were the most common type. The mean number of authors per KSSTA article significantly increased from 3.9 to 5.7 over the 20-year period (P < 0.01). The number of represented countries increased yearly and academic institutions from 40 different nationalities published articles in the Journal. Of the examined years, the percent of articles with international collaboration was 17.6%. Conclusion: The proportion of LOE I and II articles published in KSSTA remains consistently high. Therapeutic studies are the most frequently published articles. There is an increase in international groups publishing in KSSTA.

Methods: Three databases (PubMed, Ovid [MEDLINE], and EMBASE) were searched independently and in duplicate to systematically screen the literature. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) checklist guided the reporting and data abstraction. Methodological quality of all included papers was assessed using the MINORS criteria. The results are presented in a narrative summary fashion using descriptive statistics including means, proportions, and ranges. Results: Overall, 18 studies (5 case reports and 13 case series; all level IV evidence) were identified, including 201 patients (203 shoulders). The mean follow-up period was 32.7?months (range 1–154?months). Surgical decision-making for the use of arthroscopy was most commonly based on a failed trial of initial non-operative management in 17 studies (94%). Overall, 21% of cases achieved complete resolution of pre-operative symptoms, including pain, crepitus, and range of motion, while 68% of cases obtained some clinical improvement, but reported some residual symptoms (persistent crepitus [12%] and persistent scapulothoracic pain [4%]). Moreover, poor outcomes were reported 11% of cases and the most common complication was scapular oedema (6%). Conclusion: Arthroscopic management of snapping scapula syndrome yields improvement in pain, crepitus, and range of motion in a majority of patients; however, most patients experience residual symptoms. Further studies are needed to compare the outcomes of shoulder arthroscopy with other available treatment options for snapping scapula syndrome. Shoulder arthroscopy for snapping scapula can improve patients’ symptoms; however, patients must be informed about the high likelihood of persistent symptoms post-operatively.

Our objective was to determine the current state of these perceptions in an Ontario setting. Methods: A survey was developed and pretested to address patient perceptions about physician reimbursements, appropriate wait times, and out-of-pocket payment options for ACLR using a focus group of experts and by reviewing prior surveys. The survey was administered to patients in a waiting room setting. Results: Two hundred and fifty completed surveys were obtained (79.9% response rate). Participants responded that an appropriate physician reimbursement for ACLR was $1000.00 and that the Ontario Health Insurance Plan (OHIP) reimbursed physicians $700.00 for ACLR. Seventy-four percent of participants responded that the OHIP reimbursement of $615.20 for the procedure was either lower or much lower than what they considered to be an appropriate reimbursement for ACLR. Over 90% of participants responded that an ACLR should occur within 90?days of injury. Thirty-five percent of participants were willing to pay $750.00 out-of-pocket to have an ACLR done sooner, while 16.4% of participants were willing to pay $2500.00 out-of-pocket to travel outside of Canada for expedited surgery. Conclusion: This survey study demonstrates that patients’ estimates of both appropriate and actual physician reimbursements were greater than the current reimbursement for ACLR. Further, the majority of individuals report that the surgical fee for ACLR is lower than what they consider to be an appropriate amount of compensation for the procedure. Additionally, nearly all respondents believe that a ruptured ACL should be reconstructed within 90?days of injury. Consequently, a number of patients are willing to pay out-of-pocket for expedited surgery either in Canada or abroad. However, patients’ preferences for shorter wait times must be balanced with the known risk of arthrofibrosis associated with early ACLR. ? 2017, The Author(s).",Anterior cruciate ligament; Patient perceptions; Physician reimbursements; Wait times,adult; aged; analytical parameters; anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction; Article; female; health survey; human; knee injury; major clinical study; male; medical fee; Ontario; patient education; patient perception; priority journal; reimbursement; socioeconomics; travel; very elderly; wait time; waiting room,2-s2.0-85066416883

For example, infections are endemic in low- and middle-income countries with warm, moist tropical and subtropical climates because the physical and social environments are conducive to the survival and transmission of soil-transmitted helminths. At smaller scales, parasites appear to cluster within individuals and families/households predisposed to intense infections; however, this is likely due to behavioural and social environmental determinants. Additionally, STH infections are common in many regions of Africa, the Americas and South-East Asia; however, the environmental and behaviour factors that influence prevalence differ between these regions, and in turn, may require different prevention strategies. Summary: Transmission of soil-transmitted helminths is highly dependent on a number of environmental and behavioural factors that influence (i) parasite survival, (ii) the degree to which the environment is contaminated with infectious eggs and larvae and (iii) the amount of contact between human hosts and polluted soil. These factors likely explain, at least in part, the geographic distribution of soil-transmitted helminth (STH) infections at the individual, family, municipal, regional and international scale. A more complete understanding of how determinants of infection vary by geography and scale is important for informing the development of location-specific control strategies. In addition, this perspective could help researchers predict the potential effects of both large- and small-scale environmental change (of either a natural or social nature, including anthropogenic climate change, increased deforestation, altered infrastructure and increased or modified agricultural practices) on infection prevalence and intensity. Finally, focusing on geography and scale-specific determinants could help illuminate previously unidentified risk factors of infection. ? 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.",Control programs; Determinants of infection; Epidemiology; Neglected tropical diseases; Scale-specific intervention; Soil-transmitted helminth infections,altitude; ascariasis; behavior; crowding (area); defecation; disease transmission; food processing; geographic distribution; geographic elevation; geography; hand washing; helminthiasis; household; human; human development; humidity; hygiene; income; organization and management; precipitation; prevalence; priority journal; Review; risk factor; sanitation; social status; soil; soil analysis; soil moisture; temperature; trichuriasis; tropical disease; water quality,2-s2.0-85048527913

Inequities in health have been defined as those inequalities within or between populations that are avoidable, unnecessary and also unjust and unfair. Evidence-based clinical practice and public health guidelines ('guidelines') can be used to target health inequities experienced by disadvantaged populations, although guidelines may unintentionally increase health inequities. For this reason, there is a need for evidence-based clinical practice and public health guidelines to intentionally target health inequities experienced by disadvantaged populations. Current guideline development processes do not include steps for planned implementation of equity-focused guidelines. This article describes nine steps that provide guidance for consideration of equity during guideline implementation. A critical appraisal of the literature followed by a process to build expert consensus was undertaken to define how to include consideration of equity issues during the specific GRADE guideline development process. Using a case study from Colombia we describe nine steps that were used to implement equity-focused GRADE recommendations: (1) identification of disadvantaged groups, (2) quantification of current health inequities, (3) development of equity-sensitive recommendations, (4) identification of key actors for implementation of equity-focused recommendations, (5) identification of barriers and facilitators to the implementation of equity-focused recommendations, (6) development of an equity strategy to be included in the implementation plan, (7) assessment of resources and incentives, (8) development of a communication strategy to support an equity focus and (9) development of monitoring and evaluation strategies. This case study can be used as model for implementing clinical practice guidelines, taking into account equity issues during guideline development and implementation. ? The Author 2017.

METHODS After several rounds of survey development and piloting, a 29-item survey was distributed using the Dillman method to all practicing members of the Canadian Association of Thoracic Surgeons. RESULTS The response rate was 87% (62 of 71). Median number of pneumonectomies performed annually was 3.5 (interquartile range 2.75-5.00). Routine preoperative workup was variable, but the most consistently reported tests were diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (87%, n = 54) and spirometry (85%, n = 53). Reported routine use of epidurals (84%, n = 52) was more prevalent than paravertebral blocks (18%, n = 11). Many (69%, n = 43) reported intraoperative restriction <2 l. Postoperatively, 84% (n = 52) reported daily fluid restriction <2 l. Regarding intraoperative protective ventilation strategies, respondents appeared more focused on minimizing peak airway pressures (55%, n = 34) rather than tidal volumes (18%, n = 11). Twenty-four percent (n = 15) reported using intraoperative steroids in attempts to decrease postoperative complications. Thirty-two percent (n = 20) do not routinely insert chest tubes, whereas the most common practice (44%, n = 27) was to insert chest tubes attached to conventional drainage systems without suction. Eighty-two percent (n = 52) reported willingness to participate in multicentre studies regarding perioperative pneumonectomy practices. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest significant variability in reported preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative care practices for pneumonectomy across Canada. This survey has a high response rate, representing the Canadian experience, and highlights several areas for study and quality-improvement initiatives. Many respondents report willingness to participate in multicentre initiatives. ? The Author 2017.

Recent findings Patients with acute life-Threatening hypoxemia will often meet criteria for severe ARDS, for which there are only a few treatment strategies that have been shown to improve survival outcomes. Recent findings have increased our knowledge of the physiological effects of spontaneous breathing and the application of PEEP. Additionally, the use of advanced bedside monitoring has a promising future in the management of hypoxemic patients to fine-Tune the ventilator and to evaluate the individual patient response to therapy. Summary Treating the patient with acute life-Threatening hypoxemia during mechanical ventilation should begin with an evidence-based approach, with the goal of improving oxygenation and minimizing the harmful effects of mechanical ventilation. The use of advanced monitoring and the application of simple maneuvers at the bedside may assist clinicians to better individualize treatment and improve clinical outcomes.

There have been no previous attempts to describe protocols that international volunteer clinicians use in managing these patients. The purpose of this study was to collect North American clinical protocols used by sending organizations in their volunteer operations in Latin America and the Caribbean, summarize the most common pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management strategies, and compare these to published international practice recommendations. Methods: A systematic web search was used to identify North American medical service trip-sending organizations. Clinical protocols were downloaded from their websites, and organizations were directly contacted to request protocols that were not published online. The protocols obtained were summarized, analyzed thematically, and compared to existing international guidelines. Results: Of 225 organizations contacted, 112 (49.8%) responded, and 31 of these (27.7%) claimed to possess protocols for their trips, of which 20 were obtained and analyzed. Ten (50%) protocols discussed scabies, eight (40%) discussed superficial mycoses, and five (25%) discussed pyoderma. The protocols discussed clinical assessment, pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic management with variable degrees of accuracy and thoroughness, and with important omissions when compared to international guidelines. None were the product of systematic literature searches, and most were not referenced. Conclusions: To avoid ineffective treatment and related harms, context-specific clinical guidelines are needed for volunteer clinicians practicing in remote international settings, and such guidelines should be based on best evidence and stakeholder consensus. ? 2017 The International Society of Dermatology",,"amoxicillin; azithromycin; benzathine; benzyl benzoate; cefalexin; cephalosporin; clavulanic acid; clotrimazole; cloxacillin; erythromycin; flucloxacillin; fluconazole; fusidic acid; griseofulvin; ivermectin; lindane; miconazole; penicillin derivative; permethrin; pseudomonic acid; terbinafine; acne; anthrax; Article; cellulitis; chickenpox; clinical assessment; clinical practice; clinical protocol; contact dermatitis; cutaneous larva migrans; eczema; Guatemala; Haiti; Honduras; human; impetigo; leprosy; Nicaragua; pediculosis; pinta; practice guideline; psoriasis; pyoderma; scabies; skin care; South and Central America; superficial mycosis; systematic review; tinea capitis; tinea pedis; treatment duration; ulcer; verruca vulgaris; yaws; Caribbean; clinical protocol; dermatomycosis; international cooperation; organization; organization and management; primary health care; pyoderma; scabies; standards; Caribbean Region; Clinical Protocols; Dermatomycoses; Humans; Latin America; Medical Missions, Official; Organizations; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Primary Health Care; Pyoderma; Scabies",2-s2.0-85032810985

The goal of this project was to develop an evidence-based clinical tool to inform service planning while allowing for flexibility in care coordinator judgment in response to patient and family circumstances. Methods: The sample included 128,169 Ontario home care patients assessed in 2013 and 25,800 Ontario community support clients assessed between 2014 and 2016. Independent variables were drawn from the Resident Assessment Instrument-Home Care and interRAI Community Health Assessment that are standardised, comprehensive, and fully compatible clinical assessments. Clinical expertise and regression analyses identified candidate variables that were entered into decision tree models. The primary dependent variable was the weekly hours of personal support calculated based on the record of billed services. Results: The Personal Support Algorithm classified need for personal support into six groups with a 32-fold difference in average billed hours of personal support services between the highest and lowest group. The algorithm explained 30.8% of the variability in billed personal support services. Care coordinators and managers reported that the guidelines based on the algorithm classification were consistent with their clinical judgment and current practice. Conclusions: The Personal Support Algorithm provides a structured yet flexible decision-support framework that may facilitate a more transparent and equitable approach to the allocation of personal support services. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Care planning; Community care; Decision support; Health human resources; Home care; Home support; interRAI; interRAI CHA; RAI-HC; Resource allocation,adult; classification; clinical assessment; community care; decision support system; decision tree; dependent variable; female; home care; human; independent variable; major clinical study; male; manager; Ontario; practice guideline; regression analysis; resident; resource allocation; validation process; algorithm; community care; home care; organization and management; pilot study; procedures; resource allocation; validation study; Algorithms; Community Health Services; Home Care Services; Humans; Ontario; Pilot Projects; Resource Allocation,2-s2.0-85035196696

Although many studies have focused on local inflammatory sites, peripheral blood, an important mediator and a component of the systemic immune response, has not been well studied in the setting of AR.We sought to investigate immune gene signatures in peripheral blood collected after NAC under the setting of AR. Clinical symptoms and peripheral blood samples from AR subjects were collected during NAC. Fuzzy c-means clustering method was used to identify immune gene expression patterns in blood over time points (before NAC and 1, 2, and 6 h after NAC).We identified and validated seven clusters of differentially expressed immune genes after NAC onset. Clusters 2, 3, and 4 were associated with neutrophil and lymphocyte frequencies and neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio after the allergen challenge. The patterns of the clusters and immune cell frequencies were associated with the clinical symptoms of the AR subjects and were significantly different from healthy nonallergic subjects who had also undergone NAC. Our approach identified dynamic signatures of immune gene expression in blood as a systemic immune response associated with clinical symptoms after NAC. The immune gene signatures may allow cross-sectional investigation of the pathophysiology of AR and may also be useful as a potential objective measurement for diagnosis and treatment of AR combined with the NAC model.

The Hirsch index (h-index) was recently introduced to evaluate both the quality and quantity of one’s research activity. It has been proposed to be valuable in assessing promotions and grant funding within academic medicine, including plastic surgery. Our objective is to evaluate research productivity among Canadian academic plastic surgeons using the h-index. Methods: A list of Canadian academic plastic surgeons was obtained from websites of academic training programs. The h-index was retrieved using the Scopus database. Relevant demographic and academic factors were collected and their effects on the h-index were analyzed using the t test and Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test. Nominal and categorical variables were analyzed using χ2 test and 1-way analysis of variance. Univariate and multivariate models were built a priori. All P values were 2 sided, and P <.05 was considered to be significant. Results: Our study on Canadian plastic surgeons involved 175 surgeons with an average h-index of 7.6. Over 80% of the surgeons were male. Both univariable and multivariable analysis showed that graduate degree (P <.0001), academic rank (P =.03), and years in practice (P <.0001) were positively correlated with h-index. Limitations of the study include that the Scopus database and the websites of training programs were not always up-to-date. Conclusion: The h-index is a novel tool for evaluating research productivity in academic medicine, and this study shows that the h-index can also serve as a useful metric for measuring research productivity in the Canadian plastic surgery community. Plastic surgeons would be wise to familiarize themselves with the h-index concept and should consider using it as an adjunct to existing metrics such as total publication number. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Academic promotion; Education; H-index; Plastic surgery; Research productivity,adult; analysis of variance; article; chi square test; education; human; male; plastic surgeon; plastic surgery; productivity; publication; rank sum test; Scopus; statistical significance,2-s2.0-85050904510

We conducted the current study to determine whether the predictive value of early antipsychotic response persists throughout long-term treatment over multiple years. Methods: In this observational study, we conducted follow-up assessments of 64 patients with first-episode psychosis an average of 25?months after they began antipsychotic treatment. Patients were initially randomized to receive haloperidol or olanzapine, but treatment after the acute hospitalization period was not controlled. Regression analyses were used to determine whether early improvement on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale at 2 or 3?weeks predicted longer term improvement at follow-up. We conducted secondary analyses to determine whether early response could predict extrapyramidal side effects at follow-up. Results: Early response to haloperidol at 2?weeks predicted Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale improvement on longer term follow-up (p?=.002). Longer term improvement was not predicted by early response to olanzapine at 2?weeks (p?=.726) or 3?weeks (p?=.541). Rates of extrapyramidal side effects did not differ between treatment groups and were not predicted by early response. Conclusion: These results demonstrate the long-term prognostic value of early haloperidol response. The predictive value of early olanzapine response may be less robust.

A Guide to assist these offices was produced to design ethical recruitment of research volunteers within their client populations. Methods Consultations with individuals from provincial and local Societies, as well as researchers and leaders from health-related organizations, were conducted to identify in what ways these organizations are involved in study volunteer recruitment, what is and is not working, and what would be helpful to support future efforts. The Guide prototype used scenarios to illustrate study volunteer recruitment practices as they have been or could be applied in Societies. An implementable version of the Guide was produced with input from multiple internal and external reviewers including subject-matter experts and target users from Societies. Results Society staff reported that benefits of using the Guide were that it served as a catalyst for conversation and reflection and identified the need for a policy. Also, it enabled Society readiness to respond to requests by persons with dementia and their caregivers wishing to participate in research. A majority (94%) of participating Society staff across Canada agreed that they would increase their capacity to support research recruitment. Discussion Charitable organizations that raise funds for research have a role in promoting the recruitment of persons with dementia and their caregivers into clinical trials and studies.

In this study, we describe “Ko-Pamoja,” a pilot peer education program for breast and cervical cancer screening targeted specifically at Black women in Toronto, Canada. Methods: We used an Afrocentric lens to design the program, whose purpose was to increase awareness of cancer susceptibility and the benefits of screening for breast and cervical cancer for Black women. Participants were recruited through three Black-predominant churches. We used pre- and post-session questionnaires to assess changes in participant awareness of cancer susceptibility and screening guidelines, and changes in screening self-efficacy. Results: 30 women attended sessions. Ko-Pamoja was able to increase awareness of cancer susceptibility, awareness of screening guidelines, and screening self-efficacy. Two months after the last session, four women had been screened for breast cancer at a participating mammogram site.

We describe the impact of neuroinvasive and non-neuroinvasive disease on patient health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Methods: Short Form 36 questionnaire data came from a Canadian WNV cohort (Loeb 2008) of 154 patients followed for up to three years. We generated health utilities using the SF-6D. We calculated mean utility scores throughout follow-up and examined predictors using a linear mixed-effects model. We summarized HRQoL post-acute infection as: (i) long-term utility (mean of scores one year onward); (ii) area under the curve (AUC) one year onward. We examined predictors using beta regression. We used multiple imputation for sensitivity analysis. Results: Mean utility scores improved from 0.59 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.93) at baseline to 0.77 (0.53, 1) at six months, before plateauing for the remaining two years. Mean long-term utility was 0.81 (0.78, 0.85) and mean AUC was 0.80 (0.76, 0.84). Patients with neuroinvasive disease had consistently worse scores than their non-neuroinvasive counterparts, with the gap nearly closed after six months. After adjusting for confounding, neuroinvasive disease was not a significant predictor of HRQoL either throughout follow-up or post-acute infection. Rather, number of comorbidities and baseline utility scores were. Sensitivity analysis showed similar findings. Conclusions: Patients with WNV infection reported low HRQoL during acute illness, but improved rapidly by six months, regardless of neuroinvasive disease status. This is the first study reporting health utilities for WNV infection. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Health-related quality of life; Preferences; Short-form 36; Short-form 6D; West Nile virus,adult; Article; Canadian; cohort analysis; comorbidity; cost utility analysis; demography; female; Flavivirus infection; follow up; health care utilization; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; middle aged; neurologic disease; nonhuman; prediction; quality of life; scoring system; sensitivity analysis; Short Form 36; social status; West Nile virus; acute disease; aged; Canada; psychology; questionnaire; regression analysis; severity of illness index; time factor; West Nile fever; Acute Disease; Adult; Aged; Canada; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Regression Analysis; Severity of Illness Index; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors; West Nile Fever,2-s2.0-85031925919

In response to the growing demand for alternative therapies in the face of the opioid epidemic, the authors conduct a literature review to investigate the potential for prolotherapy and LLLT to be used adjunctively tomanagechronic osteoarthritis (OA).OAis a degenerative chronic musculoskeletal conditiononthe rise inNorth America, and is frequently treated with opioid medications. The regenerative action of prolotherapy and pain-modulating effects of LLLTmaymake these two therapies well-suited to synergistically provide improved outcomes for osteoarthritis patients without the side effects associated with opioid use. A narrative descriptive review through multiple medical databases (Google Scholar, PubMed, and MedLine) is conducted, restricted by the use of medical subject headings. 71 articles were selected for reading in full, and 40 articles were selected for use in the study after reading in full. A review of the literature revealed good clinical results in the use of prolotherapy and LLLT separately to manage chronic musculoskeletal pain due to osteoarthritis and other chronic conditions. It is also recognized in the literature that prolotherapy works mosteffectivelywhenused adjunctively with other treatments. Downsides to the use of prolotherapy include mild side effects of pain, stiffnessandbruisingandpotential adverse events as a result of injection. This study is limited by the lack of clinical trials available involving both LLLT and prolotherapy injections used adjunctively, and by the low number of high impact literature concerning the treatment of (specifically) osteoarthritis by alternative methods. The authors suggest that practicing health care providers consider utilizing LLLT and prolotherapy together as a supplementarymethod in the management of chronic pain due to osteoarthritis, to minimize the long-term prescription of opioids and emphasize a less invasive treatment for this debilitating condition. ? 2017, Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine.",Chronic pain; Laser therapy; Osteoarthritis; Pain management; Prolotherapy,glucose; mannitol; somatomedin C; transforming growth factor beta1; vasculotropin; analgesia; health care personnel; human; invasive procedure; low level laser therapy; Medical Subject Headings; muscle rigidity; musculoskeletal function; musculoskeletal pain; osteoarthritis; prescription; prevalence; prolotherapy; quality of life; regenerative ability; regenerative medicine; Review; skin bruising; temporomandibular joint disorder,2-s2.0-85037628734

Background: The perspective of users should be an integral component of a patient-centered, evidence-based approach to the design of health facilities. Methods: We conducted a discrete choice conjoint experiment (DCE), a method from marketing research and health economics, as a component of a strategy to engage users in the preconstruction planning process. A sample of 467 participants (290 staff and 177 clients or community stakeholders) completed the DCE. Results: Latent class analysis identified three segments with different design preferences. A group we termed an enhanced design (57%) segment preferred a fully featured facility with personal contacts at the start of visits (in-person check-in, personal waiting room notification, volunteer-assisted wayfinding, and visible security), a family resource center with a health librarian, and an outdoor playground equipped with covered heated pathways. The self-guided design segment (11%), in contrast, preferred a design allowing a more independent use of the facility (e.g., self-check-in at computer kiosks, color-coded wayfinding, and a self-guided family resource center). Designs affording privacy and personal contact with staff were important to the private design segment (32%). The theme and decor of the building was less important than interactive features and personal contacts. Conclusion: A DCE allowed us to engage users in the planning process by estimating the value of individual design elements, identifying segments with differing views, informing decisions regarding design trade-offs, and simulating user response to design options. ? 2016, ?

Extremely elevated levels of serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) are characteristic of the syndrome. Chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) infections can also be present in POEMS. The pathogenesis of the syndrome is not well understood. The link between chronic alcohol consumption and this malignant condition has not been reported until now. In addition, no previous study has evaluated the influence of cytokine and chemokines or viruses in the severity and evolution of POEMS. Objectives: (1) to describe a heavy-alcohol user, who was diagnosed with POEMS; (2) to demonstrate the utility of quantitative measurement of serum levels of VEGF in the diagnosis of POEMS and the monitoring of therapeutic interventions; (3) to demonstrate that overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines is a characteristic of POEMS. Methods: We describe a case of a POEMS patient presenting HCV and who is a heavy drinker; we compare the serum levels of cytokines and chemokines between the POEMS patient with 80 patients with HCV, 12 healthy controls, and 80 individuals with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). We quantified (ELISA pg/mL) the levels of VEGF, Interferon gamma (IFN-γ), Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF-α), Regulated-upon-Activation Normal-T-cell-Expressed and presumably-Secreted (RANTES), and Nuclear Factor kappa-B (NFκB). Results: In POEMS patients, VEGF levels were elevated versus control or other diseases, TNFα levels were higher versus control, but lower when compared with HCV or ALD patients. VEGF levels in POEMS patients decreased with therapeutic intervention. Conclusions: Chronic alcohol misuse can be a strong risk factor to rare malignancies such as POEMS syndrome. Extreme elevation of VEGF levels is diagnostic for POEMS syndrome, and should be followed to assess response to therapy. In addition, other comorbidities should be considered individually to ensure personalized therapeutic intervention. ? 2017 by the authors.

Appropriate detection of AF and early initiation of oral anticoagulation therapy are critical to reduce the risk of stroke. Patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICD) are at high risk of developing AF. The purpose of the Dx-AF study is to demonstrate that a novel single-lead VDD-ICD system (Linox smart S DX) will facilitate adequate recognition of sub-clinical AF and ultimately stroke prevention with a comparable safety profile in comparison to VVI-ICD. Methods and results: Dx-AF is a prospective, randomized controlled, open-label trial. Patients who are indicated to receive a single-chamber ICD will be randomized to a VDD-ICD (experimental group) or single-chamber ICD (control group). We have used a sample size of 355, which after generous allowance for loss-to-follow-up, yields a sample size of 378 patients at up to 13 Canadian sites. The trial will enroll patients with ischemic or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy, age?>?50?years, LVEF?<?50%, scheduled for primary or secondary prevention single-chamber ICD, with no ECG-documented history of AF or flutter. The primary (efficacy) outcome of this study will be the time to the first detected and confirmed episode of AF or atrial flutter lasting at least 6?min. The secondary (safety) outcome will be a composite outcome of serious device-related complications. The proposed follow-up period in this trial will be 36?months after randomization. Conclusions: The Dx-AF Study should provide significant scientific evidence and guidance to an adequate ICD system choice and early AF detection/management hence improve clinical outcomes in a large patient population. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Atrial fibrillation; Implantable cardioverter defibrillators; Single-lead VDD-ICD,"Article; atrial fibrillation; cerebrovascular accident; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; follow up; heart atrium flutter; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; ischemic cardiomyopathy; major clinical study; multicenter study; outcome assessment; patient compliance; primary prevention; priority journal; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sample size; secondary prevention; adverse device effect; aged; atrial fibrillation; Canada; clinical trial; comparative study; device safety; electrocardiography; equipment design; female; implantable cardioverter defibrillator; Kaplan Meier method; male; middle aged; mortality; nonparametric test; patient selection; physiologic monitoring; procedures; prognosis; severity of illness index; survival analysis; utilization; Aged; Atrial Fibrillation; Canada; Defibrillators, Implantable; Electrocardiography; Equipment Design; Equipment Safety; Female; Humans; Kaplan-Meier Estimate; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Patient Selection; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index; Statistics, Nonparametric; Stroke; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-85026907352

To test the hypothesis that cardiometabolic conditions and depression and anxiety confound the relationship between region and incident prefrailty and frailty in American compared with European women. Materials and Methods: The Global Longitudinal Study of Osteoporosis in Women (GLOW) is a 5-year observational cohort study of women aged ?55 years. A total of 19,674 participants from the United States and Europe were nonfrail at baseline and provided information on characteristics, including body mass index, depression and anxiety, and cardiovascular disease. We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models to examine the relationship between region and incident frailty and prefrailty. Results: Over 40% of respondents became prefrail or frail during follow-up. Adjusting for age, body mass index, depression and anxiety, cardiovascular disease, and other health-related characteristics, European respondents had a decreased risk of developing prefrailty (2-year hazard ratio [HR]: 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.73-0.84; 3-year HR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.67-0.81) and frailty (2-year HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.76; 3-year HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.68-0.99) compared with American respondents. Risk of incident frailty and prefrailty did not vary by region at 5 years of follow-up. Conclusions: Cardiometabolic conditions and depression and anxiety did not account for increased frailty and prefrailty onset among American compared with European women.

We present a technique of surgical repair for muscular VSDs, which includes surgical exposure and detection of these defects and has excellent clinical outcomes. METHODS: We have analysed consecutive patients who underwent surgical repair of isolated multiple muscular VSDs under cardiopulmonary bypass over a 16-year period (from January 2001 to November 2016) in a single centre from the southern part of India. These defects were accessed through the right atrium in most cases and closed directly; completeness of closure was confirmed by pressurizing the left ventricle with blood cardioplegia. There were no haemodynamically significant residual VSDs following repair. RESULTS: One hundred and two patients with an average time of follow-up of 4.1 years (1 month-12 years) were included. The mean age of our patients at the time of operation was 23.5 months (3 months-22 years) with a mean weight of 7.9 kg (2-55 kg). The mean cardiopulmonary bypass and cross-clamp time was 118.8 ± 39.2 min (mean ± SD) and 76.5 ± 29.4 min (mean ± SD), respectively. There were 10 (9.8%) hospital deaths and 3 late deaths in the entire study group. Permanent pacemaker was implanted in 2 patients. Seventy patients could be followed up after discharge. Postoperative pulmonary artery pressure was normal in 52% of the patients, mild-to-moderate hypertension in 27% and severe in 7% of the patients. The ejection fraction was >60% among the survivors, and there were no reoperations or reinterventions. CONCLUSIONS: This surgical approach to multiple muscular VSDs is safe and effective with minimal risk of complete heart block and diminution of ventricular function. ?

Client Description: All physiotherapy students participating in the third 6-week clinical placement at McMaster University were eligible to apply for one CS placement. A placement description and expectations were developed collaboratively by the clinical site and the MSc(PT) programme before placement matching. Intervention: A shared supervisory model between one acute care physiotherapist and a critical care CS was developed to provide supervision in both clinical and research-related activities during the placement. Measures and Outcomes: The first CS clinical placement in the MSc(PT) Program at McMaster was completed between November and December 2015. The student was evaluated using the same process as a traditional student placement. Over 6 weeks, the student gained clinical experience in an acute care setting; accumulated more than 100 cardiorespiratory hours; participated in research activities for a randomized controlled trial, which led to a submission to Physiotherapy Practice; and applied for the Canadian Institutes of Health Research Health Professional Student Research Award. Implications: The CS is a developing role for Canadian physiotherapists. A CS placement gave the physiotherapy student the opportunity to apply traditional skills and knowledge as well as to develop advanced research skills. The success of this placement has established a foundation for future placements. ? 2017, University of Toronto Press Inc.

Materials and Methods Multiple breath-holding and forced shallow free-breathing IVIM scans were performed on 8 healthy volunteers using 1 and 6 gradient directions. Cluster analysis was carried out to separate motion-contaminated parenchyma from liver parenchyma and vessels. Nonlinear motion analysis was also performed to look for a possible link between IVIM metrics and nonlinear liver motion. Results On the basis of the resulted clusters, motion-contaminated parenchyma is often noted in the left liver lobe, where the prominent pseudohepatic artifact has previously been identified. A significant reduction in outliers was obtained with the acquisition of 6 noncoplanar gradient directions and when using forced shallow free-breathing. Conclusion The pseudohepatic anisotropy artifact can be minimized when using multiple diffusion-encoding gradient directions and forced free-breathing during IVIM acquisition.

Of the 11,264 patients enrolled, 9,495 (84.3%) were eligible for one or more CV evidence-based therapies. The proportions of patients with AF receiving all eligible guideline-recommended therapies were 40.8% of patients with coronary artery disease, 48.9% of patients with diabetes mellitus, 40.2% of patients with heart failure, 96.7% of patients with hypertension, and 55.1% of patients with peripheral arterial disease. Factors that were independently associated with nonreceipt of all indicated evidence-based therapies included sinus rhythm rather than AF at baseline and liver disease. In conclusion, although most Canadian outpatients with AF have CV risk factors or co-morbidities, a substantial portion of these patients did not receive all guideline-recommended therapies.

Usually, the goal is to determine the effectiveness of an intervention, to determine the strength of association between two factors, to determine the prevalence of a condition, or to scope the literature. Research synthesis methods can also be used to appraise the quantity and quality of research output from institutions or countries. In the latter case, standard quantitative systematic review methodologies would not apply and investigators must borrow strategies from qualitative syntheses and bibliometric analyses to develop a complete and meaningful appraisal of the literature from a given country. Methods: In this paper, we use the example of Cameroon to highlight some of the challenges and opportunities of appraising a body of country-specific literature. A comprehensive and exhaustive search of the literature was conducted to identify health-related literature from Cameroon published from 2005 to 2014. Titles were screened in duplicate. Results: A total of 8624 studies were retrieved of which 721 were retained. The main challenges were making a choice of synthesis approach; selecting the right databases, data storage and management; and sustaining the team. Key opportunities include enhanced networking, a detailed appraisal of funding sources, international collaborations, language of publication, and issues with study design. The product is a comprehensive and informative body of evidence that can be used to inform policy with regards to international collaboration, location of research studies, language of publication, knowledge areas of focus, and gaps. Conclusion: Knowledge synthesis approaches can be adapted for appraisal of country-specific research and offer opportunities for in-depth appraisal of research output. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Cameroon; Research output; Research synthesis,Cameroon; case study; citation analysis; data base; data synthesis; funding; information processing; intersectoral collaboration; language; literature; medical research; Note; priority journal; publication; research synthesis; social network; team building; Cameroon; health promotion; health services research; human; Cameroon; Health Promotion; Health Services Research; Humans,2-s2.0-85027113766

In this phase II study, we report the feasibility, tolerability and efficacy of adjuvant sunitinib. Included were patients with stage IIa, IIB or III cancer of the thoracic esophagus or gastroesophageal junction. Neoadjuvant therapy involved Irinotecan (65 mg/m2) + Cisplatin (30 mg/m2) on weeks 1 and 2, 4 and 5, 7 and 8 with concurrent radiation (50 Gy/25 fractions) on weeks 4–8. Sunitinib was commenced 4–13?weeks after surgery and continued for one year. Sixty-one patients were included in the final analysis, 36 patients commenced adjuvant sunitinib. Fourteen patients discontinued sunitinib due to disease recurrence (39%) within the 12-month period, 12 (33%) discontinued due to toxicity, and 3 (8%) requested cessation of therapy. In the overall population, median survival was 26?months with a 2 and 3-year survival rate of 52% and 35%, respectively. The median survival for the 36 patients treated with sunitinib was 35?months and 2-year survival probability of 68%. In a historical control, a prior phase II study with the same trimodality therapy (n = 43), median survival was 36?months, with a 2-year survival of 67%. Initiation of adjuvant sunitinib is feasible, but poorly tolerated, with no signal of additional benefit over trimodality therapy for locally advanced esophageal cancer. ? 2017, ? 2017 International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus.",,,2-s2.0-85049161242

Given the scarcity of trustworthy clinical practice guidelines providing recommendations to answer clinicians' daily questions, clinical decision support systems (ie, assistance in question identification and answering) emerge as an attractive alternative. The trustworthiness of the recommendations achieved by such systems is unknown. Objective: To evaluate the trustworthiness of a question identification and answering system that delivers timely recommendations. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: We compared the responses to 100 clinical questions related to inpatient management provided by two rapid response methods with 'Gold Standard' recommendations. One of the rapid methods was based on PubMed and the other on Epistemonikos database. We defined our 'Gold Standard' as trustworthy published evidence-based recommendations or, when unavailable, recommendations developed locally by a panel of six clinicians following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Recommendations provided by the rapid strategies were classified as potentially misleading or reasonable. We also determined if the potentially misleading recommendations could have been avoided with the appropriate implementation of searching and evidence summary tools. Results: We were able to answer all of the 100 questions with both rapid methods. Of the 200 recommendations obtained, 6.5% (95% CI 3% to 9.9%) were classified as potentially misleading and 93.5% (95% CI 90% to 96.9%) as reasonable. 6 of the 13 potentially misleading recommendations could have been avoided by the appropriate usage of the Epistemonikos matrix tool or by constructing summary of findings tables. No significant differences were observed between the evaluated rapid response methods. Conclusion A question answering service based on the GRADE approach proved feasible to implement and provided appropriate guidance for most identified questions. Our approach could help stakeholders in charge of managing resources and defining policies for patient care to improve evidence-based decision-making in an efficient and feasible manner. ? 2017 Article author(s).",decision support; evidence based practice; informationist,"answering service; controlled study; cross-sectional study; decision support system; female; gold standard; hospital patient; human; major clinical study; male; Medline; patient care; clinical decision making; clinical decision support system; cross-sectional study; evidence based medicine; information retrieval; Medline; point of care system; practice guideline; procedures; qualitative research; standards; Clinical Decision-Making; Cross-Sectional Studies; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Information Storage and Retrieval; Point-of-Care Systems; Practice Guidelines as Topic; PubMed; Qualitative Research",2-s2.0-85027123840

The aim of our study was to investigate the relationships between a healthy lifestyle and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone with both glycemic and cardiovascular properties. Healthy participants aged 25–41?years without cardiovascular disease, diabetes or a body mass index (BMI) &gt;?35?kg/m2 were enrolled in a population-based study. The following metrics were used to build a lifestyle score ranging from 0 to 7 (a higher score indicating a healthier lifestyle): blood pressure (BP) (&lt;?120/80?mm?Hg), plasma levels of glycated hemoglobin (&lt;?5.7%), total cholesterol levels (&lt;?200?mg/dl), BMI (&lt;?25?kg/m2), not smoking cigarettes, moderate (??150?min/week) or vigorous (??75?min/week) physical activity and a healthy diet. Among 2133 participants median age was 36.7?years and 53.3% were female. GLP-1 levels decreased significantly from 39.5 to 30.9?ng/l (p?&lt;?0.0001) across increasing lifestyle score categories. This linear relationship persisted in multivariable adjusted linear regression models (B for GLP-1 per 1-unit increase of the lifestyle score ??0.06; 95% confidence intervals ??0.07, ??0.04; p?&lt;?0.0001). Individual health metrics that were significantly associated with GLP-1 were a normal BMI (??0.07; ??0.12, ??0.03; p?=?0.001), low total cholesterol levels (??0.07; ??0.12, ??0.03; p?=?0.001), normal BP (??0.05; ??0.10, ??0.00; p?=?0.047) and not smoking (??0.06; ??0.10, ??0.01; p?=?0.01).

This is a prospective cohort study. Objective. The aim of this study was to define the probability of successful morning-after discharge after adult spine surgery achieved with a standard care protocol as applied to patients with a large variety of common degenerative spine disorders. Summary of Background Data. Qualifying criteria for ambulatory or overnight-stay adult spine surgery are not well defined in either the spine or anesthesia literature. Most reports simply go to American Society of Anesthesiology risk classification or surgical technique alternatives and do not present a clearly defined patient care and case management protocol. Methods. A standardized protocol of patient preparation, preoperative comorbidities optimization, and perioperative care was applied in a prospective cohort of 126 patients including 83 lumbar and 41 cervical procedures. Office and hospital chart records were reviewed for relevant outcomes. Results. Fully 122 of 124 appropriately selected cases were able to successfully achieve uneventful same-day discharge without any need for readmission, unscheduled early emergency room or clinic visits, or other major complications. Both failures were for urinary retention in senior males and resolved after a single-day admission to the main hospital. Conclusion. A wide variety of common degenerative spinal pathology in adults can be routinely and safely managed on an overnight-stay basis without requirement for formal hospital inpatient admission in patients appropriately selected and preeducated to the experience and whose major comorbidities are preoperatively optimized. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Adults; Overnight-Stay surgery; protocol; results,"adult; aged; ambulatory surgery; Article; cervical spine; clinical outcome; clinical protocol; comorbidity; emergency care; female; hospital discharge; hospital readmission; human; lumbar spine; major clinical study; male; patient care; perioperative period; postoperative complication; preoperative care; priority journal; probability; prospective study; spine surgery; treatment failure; urine retention; ambulatory surgery; Canada; clinical protocol; decompression surgery; discectomy; health care; laminoplasty; length of stay; middle aged; organization and management; Spinal Diseases; spine; spine fusion; standards; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Surgical Procedures; Canada; Clinical Protocols; Comprehensive Health Care; Decompression, Surgical; Diskectomy; Female; Humans; Laminoplasty; Length of Stay; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Spinal Diseases; Spinal Fusion; Spine; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84996757692

It has been suggested that polymorphisms of PPARG are associated with the risk of EH. However, findings to date remain controversial. To elucidate the associations between the PPARG Pro12Ala and C161T polymorphisms and EH risk, a meta-analysis was carried out. Methods: A comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Embase, CNKI (Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure), VIP and Wanfang databases was conducted. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated to estimate the size of the effect using the random-effects model. At the same time, the pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% CI was used for the meta-analysis of the PPARG Pro12Ala polymorphism and blood pressure. Results: Finally, Fifteen papers (seventeen studies) including 4,151 cases and 4,997 controls to evaluate the association of the PPARGPro12Ala polymorphism and EH risk, were included in this study. Overall, the results suggested that Ala allele was associated with the decreased EH risk (for allelic model, OR = 0.757, 95%CI: 0.624–0.918, P = 0.005; for dominant model, OR = 0.771, 95%CI: 0.627–0.946, P = 0.013). The subgroup analysis stratified by ethnicity showed that the significant association between the PPARG Pro12Ala polymorphism and EH was only detected in the Asian subgroup. There was no difference in blood pressure values between Ala carriers and non-carriers. For the C161T polymorphism, only 5 studies comprising 1,118 cases and 1,357 controls met the inclusion criteria. The overall results showed that the PPARG C161T polymorphism was not associated with the risk of EH. But in the subgroup analysis, we found that the PPARG C161T polymorphism significantly associated with the risk of EH in the Asian subgroup (for allelic model, OR = 0.719, 95% CI: 0.537–0.963, P = 0.027; for dominant model, OR = 0.653, 95% CI: 0.439–0.972, P = 0.036). Conclusion: Our meta-analysis suggested that the PPARG polymorphisms might be associated with the risk of EH. ? 2017 Cai et al.

Less is known about other hygiene-related behaviors (HRBs) in OCD. In contrast, extensive public health research has examined the frequency and duration of personal (e.g., handwashing) and household (e.g., scrubbing tub/shower) HRBs in community members. The present study connected these literatures by examining self-reported HRB frequency and duration in 25 patients with OCD with predominant contamination-related symptoms, 95 patients with social anxiety disorder, 36 patients with panic disorder with agoraphobia, and 31 nonclinical community members. Participants reported the frequency or duration of common HRBs. Patients with OCD reported greater frequency of daily handwashing, but the groups did not differ with respect to the frequency/duration of other HRBs or the overall frequency/duration of HRBs. A minority of participants in all groups had high levels of engagement in at least one hygiene-related activity, and within each group, different psychological factors were associated with high hygiene engagement. These findings suggest that for many patients with OCD and contamination concerns, the frequency of handwashing is heightened, whereas frequencies/durations of other HRBs are similar to those for people without OCD. More research is needed on the mechanisms associated with high hygiene engagement. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Cleaning; Compulsion; Contamination; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Washing,adult; agoraphobia; anxiety disorder; Article; behavior; behavior assessment; comparative study; contamination related obsessive compulsive disorder; controlled study; demography; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; disease association; disease duration; emotional stress; Everyday Behaviors List; female; hand washing; human; hygiene related behavior; major clinical study; male; mood; negative mood; obsessive compulsive disorder; Obsessive Compulsive Inventory Revised; panic; perception; priority journal; scrubbing tub; self report; shower; social phobia; Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders; Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale,2-s2.0-85020860636

Diseases of the kidney may be rapid in onset, cause severe organ dysfunction, and then resolve quickly to complete or incomplete recovery. These forms of kidney disease are collectively referred in this work as acute kidney injury, and result from a variety of causes. Generally these causes can be characterized as prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal. We examine various animal models of acute kidney injury in this context and describe their pathophysiological features, as well as their relevance to human disease. Kidney diseases may also develop over longer periods of time and produce permanent damage to the organ that cannot be recovered. In general, we refer to these forms of kidney disease as chronic kidney diseases, and present animal models across their range, including hypertensive, diabetic, and glomerular diseases. We also examine animal models of autoimmune and hereditary kidney diseases. In all cases, we attempt to accurately describe the model and some of its variants, as well as their relevance to human disease. ? 2017 Elsevier Inc.

We do this by presenting a close analysis of two transcripts drawn from a study about the vulnerability to HIV faced by Chinese immigrants to Canada. Our goal is to illustrate the application of narrative analysis and highlight the contributions it can make to conceptualising how transnationalism becomes consequential in accounts of intimate life. In narrative terms, transnationalism lends each life situation dual or multiple interpretive frameworks. Migrants from China to Canada situate their personal stories in relation to social and cultural norms and features of both nations. Yet, as our analysis makes apparent, ‘Canada’ and ‘China’ do not carry singular or consistent meanings in migrants’ stories. Attention to the role of stories in self-making allows us to better understand why transnational contexts appear as they do in narrative accounts, and responds to calls for more accurate mappings of the interface between transnationalism and the subject. Attention to how stories are ‘put together’ shows that transnational discursive resources are assembled in ways that bolster, and also undermine, entitlements to safe and equitable intimate relationships. ? 2017 The Author(s).

Inconsistency in endpoint definitions can make interpretation of trial results more difficult, especially if conflicting evidence is present. Furthermore, this inconsistency impedes evidence synthesis and meta-analyses. The goals of StEP are to harmonise definitions for clinically meaningful endpoints and specify standards for endpoint reporting in clinical trials. To help inform this endeavour, we aim to conduct a scoping review to systematically characterise the definitions of clinically important endpoints in the existing published literature on perioperative blood loss and transfusion. Methods and analysis The scoping review will be conducted using the widely adopted framework developed by Arksey and O'Malley, with modifications from Levac. We refined our methods with guidance from research librarians as well as researchers and clinicians with content expertise. The electronic literature search will involve several databases including Medline, PubMed-not-Medline and Embase. Our review has three objectives, namely to (1) identify definitions of significant blood loss and transfusion used in previously published large perioperative randomised trials; (2) identify previously developed consensus-based definitions for significant blood loss and transfusion in perioperative medicine and related fields; and (3) describe the association between different magnitudes of blood loss and transfusion with postoperative outcomes. The multistage review process for each question will involve two reviewers screening abstracts, reading full-text articles and performing data extraction. The abstracted data will be organised and subsequently analysed in an iterative process. Ethics and dissemination This scoping review of the previously published literature does not require research ethics approval. The results will be used to inform a consensus-based process to develop definitions of clinically important perioperative blood loss and transfusion. The results of the scoping review will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal. ?

Setting and sample: 40 Community Dental Services sites operating across the North-West of England. Basic Research Design: A data envelopment analysis was undertaken of inputs (number of surgeries, hours worked by dental officers, therapists, hygienists and others) and outputs (treatments delivered, number of courses of treatment and patients seen) of the Community Dental Services to produce relative efficiency ratings by health authority. These were further analyzed in order to identify which inputs (determined within the Community Dental Services) or external factors outside the control of the Community Dental Services are associated with efficiency. Main outcome measure: Relative efficiency rankings in Community Dental Services production of dental healthcare. Results: Using the quantity of treatments delivered as the measure of output, on average the Community Dental Services in England is operating at a relative efficiency of 85% (95% confidence interval 77%- 99%) compared to the best performing services. Average efficiency is lower when courses of treatment and unique patients seen are used as output measures, 82% and 68% respectively. Neither the input mix nor the patient case mix explained variations in the efficiency across Community Dental Services. Conclusions: Although large variations in performance exist across Community Dental Services, the data available was not able to explain these variations. A useful next step would be to undertake detailed case studies of several best and under-performing services to explore the factors that influence relative performance levels. ?

Conclusions: The study findings highlighted the factors that empower and obstruct community midwives in providing services in rural areas. The majority of the community midwives felt empowered because of their increased earning capacity and enhanced competencies in performing their roles. However, some of them shared challenges in terms of socio-cultural and financial constraints. These findings have important implications for midwives working in rural areas. ?

To improve patients' adherence, hospitals either modify DOT or adopt different approaches: pharmaceutical care or home visit. Our objective was to assess pulmonary TB treatment success rate of pharmaceutical care compared to home visit and modified DOT in Thailand. Methods: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data collected in adult pulmonary TB patients starting treatment between October 2010 and September 2013 in three hospitals in Thailand. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at each of the participating hospitals. We built a propensity score matching to account for differences in patient baseline characteristics. Results: Analysis included 1398 patients. Before matching, the treatment success rate for patients receiving pharmaceutical care was 94.9%, home visit 93.6% and modified DOT 90.1%. The propensity score-matched cohorts indicated that differences in the treatment success rate were not statistically significant when comparing pharmaceutical care with either home visit (success rate: 92.76% vs 94.74%, risk difference: 1.97%, 95% CI ?3.64 to 7.59) or modified DOT (success rate 93.37% for both, risk difference: 0%, 95% CI ?5.30 to 5.30). What is new and conclusion: Pharmaceutical care, home visit and modified DOT are all associated with high success rate for pulmonary TB treatment and exceeded the WHO target, in this retrospective analysis. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",adherence; patient education; pharmaceutical care; pulmonary tuberculosis; self-administered therapy,"ethambutol; isoniazid; pyrazinamide; rifampicin; tuberculostatic agent; adult; Article; cohort analysis; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; directly observed therapy; drug rechallenge; female; home visit; hospitalization; human; liver toxicity; lung tuberculosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multidrug resistant tuberculosis; pharmaceutical care; retrospective study; Thai (people); treatment duration; young adult; adolescent; clinical trial; comparative study; drug self administration; hospital; lung tuberculosis; medication compliance; multicenter study; organization and management; pharmacy; procedures; Thailand; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Adult; Antitubercular Agents; Cohort Studies; Directly Observed Therapy; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Pharmaceutical Services; Retrospective Studies; Self Administration; Thailand; Treatment Outcome; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85016635234

Nevertheless, POCT is costly and its contribution to patient outcome is unknown. There is a lack of guidelines to describe which patients should undergo intraoperative testing or how results should be applied. As such, we undertook a historical cohort study evaluating intraoperative testing practices within our region where POCT is not used. Methods: In 2012, we obtained a random sample of 1,000 adult patients undergoing noncardiac surgery in three of our health system hospitals. Patient, surgical, and testing details were extracted, and the surgical procedures were categorized using the Johns Hopkins risk guidelines. Our primary outcome was the administration of at least one intraoperative test. We used a multivariable logistic regression model to identify factors associated with testing and described the time from ordering the tests to receiving the results using descriptive statistics. Results: Study results showed that 110/1,000 (11.0%) patients underwent 413 diagnostic tests. Complete blood count was the most commonly administered test (36.3%), and the mean (standard deviation) time to obtain all test results was 29.9 (19.9) min. High-risk procedures were associated with an odds ratio (OR) of 12.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.3 to 18.2; P < 0.001). Other predictors of intraoperative testing included emergency surgery (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.0 to 7.2; P < 0.001), number of comorbidities (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.2; P = 0.03), and duration of surgery (OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.8 to 2.9; P < 0.001). Conclusion: Intraoperative testing is common and more likely in patients undergoing high-risk surgical procedures. In a central laboratory system, there is substantial time from ordering the tests to receiving the results. The clinical impact of this delay is unknown. Further evaluation is required regarding the relationship between the time required for intraoperative test results and perioperative outcomes. ? 2017, Canadian Anesthesiologists' Society.",,"adult; Article; blood cell count; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; diagnostic test; emergency surgery; female; human; major clinical study; male; noncardiac surgery; operation duration; outcome assessment; peroperative care; point of care testing; practice guideline; priority journal; surgery; aged; anesthesiology; clinical trial; hospital; intraoperative monitoring; middle aged; multicenter study; multivariate analysis; peroperative complication; procedures; retrospective study; risk; statistical model; surgery; time factor; Adult; Aged; Anesthesiology; Cohort Studies; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Intraoperative Complications; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Multivariate Analysis; Operative Time; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Retrospective Studies; Risk; Surgical Procedures, Operative; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85014010746

The 11-item version showed promise, but the ergonomic subscale was deficient. The OPP-14 was developed by adding three additional items to the ergonomics subscale. The aim of this study is to evaluate the factor structure using confirmatory factor and Rasch analyses in healthy firefighters. Methods A sample of 261 firefighters (Mean age 42?years, 95?% male) were sampled. A confirmatory factor and Rasch analyses were used to assess the internal consistency, factor structure and other psychometric characteristics of revised OPP-14. Results The OPP-14 demonstrates sound factor structure and internal consistency in firefighters. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the consistency of the original 4-domain structure (CFI?=?0.97, TLI?=?0.96, and RMSEA?=?0.053). The 5 items showing misfit initially with disordered thresholds were rescored. The four subscales satisfied Rasch expectations with well target and acceptable reliability. Conclusions The OPP-14 scale shows a promising factor structure in this sample and remediated deficits found in OPP-11. This version may be preferable for musculoskeletal concerns or work applications where ergonomic indicators are relevant. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Confirmatory factor analysis; Organizational policies and practices; Rasch analysis; Work disability,"adult; cross-sectional study; ergonomics; factor analysis; female; fire fighter; human; male; middle aged; occupational accident; occupational health; organizational policy; psychometry; questionnaire; reproducibility; standards; validation study; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ergonomics; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Firefighters; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Health; Occupational Injuries; Organizational Policy; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84978032418

However, little is known about one aspect of cognitive aging in which speed is of the essence, namely, the speed with which older adults can deploy attention in response to a cue. Methods: The authors compared rapid temporal modulation of cued visual attention in younger (Mage?=?22.3?years) and older (Mage?=?68.9?years) adults. On each trial of a short-term memory task, a cue identified which of two briefly presented stimuli was task relevant and which one should be ignored. After a short delay, subjects demonstrated recall by reproducing from memory the task-relevant stimulus. This produced estimates of (i) accuracy with which the task-relevant stimulus was recalled, (ii) the influence of stimuli encountered on previous trials (a prototype effect), and (iii) the influence of the trial’s task-irrelevant stimulus. Results: For both groups, errors in recall were considerably smaller when selective attention was cued before rather than after presentation of the stimuli. Both groups showed serial position effects to the same degree, and both seemed equally adept at exploiting the stimuli encountered on previous trials as a means of supplementing recall accuracy on the current trial. Conclusion: Younger and older subjects may not differ reliably in capacity for cue-directed temporal modulation of selective attention, or in ability to draw on previously seen stimuli as memory support.

Multiple other, less pronounced, enlarged cranial nerves were noted. The differential diagnosis included chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP), hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy (HMSN), neurofibromatosis (NF), and schwannomatosis. The absence of other muscle weakness and of sensory symptoms combined with normal peripheral nerve conduction studies effectively ruled out the hypertrophic polyneuropathies and pointed to a syndromic cause of multiple benign peripheral nerve sheath tumours (PNSTs).

In 2005, provincial and territorial wait time benchmarks were set in areas such as hip and knee replacement, but such efforts were lagging for urogynaecological surgeries. This study aimed to compare wait times and HRQOL scores of females awaiting surgery for POP with those of women awaiting hip or knee replacement. Methods This was a prospectively planned study comparing women undergoing surgical repair of POP to women having a hip or knee replacement. All women completed a validated HRQOL questionnaire, the Short Form 36 Health Survey. The date of the decision to operate was recorded and patients were followed up prospectively to determine surgical wait time. Results Three of four physical health concepts were significantly worse for orthopedic patients compared with urogynaecology patients, including the physical component summary (29.2 vs. 41.5, respectively, P < 0.001). Urogynaecology and orthopedic patients had similar emotional and mental well-being, as demonstrated by similar mental component summaries (41.5 vs. 44.6, respectively, P?= 0.09). The mean wait time at our institution for hip or knee replacement was 98 days, which was significantly shorter than the mean wait time of 210 days for POP surgery (P < 0.001). Conclusion Despite less physical and pain impact, urogynaecology patients showed similar emotional distress and mental impact compared with orthopedic patients based on a validated HRQOL questionnaire. Because urogynaecology patients waited more than twice as long for their surgery, resources should be directed to prioritize and improve the surgical wait time for urogynaecology patients. ? 2017 The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada/La Soci?t? des obst?triciens et gyn?cologues du Canada",pelvic organ prolapse; Quality of life; waiting lists,"adult; aged; Article; controlled study; emotional stress; female; hip replacement; human; knee replacement; major clinical study; pelvic organ prolapse; physical capacity; prospective study; psychological well-being; quality of life; Short Form 36; time to treatment; wait time; Canada; comparative study; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; hip replacement; knee replacement; mental health; mental stress; middle aged; pain; pathophysiology; pelvic organ prolapse; psychology; time factor; time to treatment; Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Knee; Canada; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Mental Health; Middle Aged; Pain; Pelvic Organ Prolapse; Prospective Studies; Quality of Life; Stress, Psychological; Time Factors; Time-to-Treatment",2-s2.0-85016503886

Previous studies have documented low rates of recurrence, but patient-reported outcomes remain uncertain. Methods This study was a prospective, observational assessment of children and adolescents who underwent the Vandenbos procedure for one or more ingrown toenails. Standardized assessments of pain, functional status, and quality of life were completed before surgery and then one, two, and six months postoperatively. Results Thirty-nine participants (with 59 ingrown toenails) completed at least one postoperative assessment and were included in the analysis. Age ranged from 4 to 20?years (mean 13.5?years). Recovery time was a median of 7?days for return to school or work and 23?days for being able to wear enclosed shoes. Seven participants (18%) experienced one or more minor complications within the first two months of surgery. There were no recurrences. Ninety-five percent of participants and 100% of parents would recommend the Vandenbos procedure. Conclusions We conclude that the Vandenbos procedure is associated with a low recurrence rate in children, adolescents, and young adults with ingrown toenails.

However, it usually affects the lower extremity long bones. Scapular involvement is extremely rare, as is a metastasis to the parasellar region. We present a case of liposarcoma of the skull base originating in the scapular region and metastasizing to the sellar and parasellar regions and provide a review of the pertinent literature. CLINICAL PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old female patient diagnosed with left scapular myxoid liposarcoma was treated with surgical resection. She had clear resection margins and was treated pre- and postoperatively with radiotherapy to the region. She remained asymptomatic for 2 years following surgery, after which she abruptly developed diplopia with right lateral gaze. There were no symptoms of raised intracranial pressure or impaired vision. Her examination was normal apart from complete right sixth nerve palsy. Imaging studies of the brain showed a large mass in the clivus eroding into the floor of the sella, encircling the right internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus. The mass also displaced the sellar contents superiorly. An endonasal, endoscopic skull base approach was undertaken, and a subtotal resection was performed in an effort to avoid multiple cranial nerve pareses. CONCLUSION: Our literature search revealed that this case report is the first to document liposarcoma metastasis to the skull base originating from the scapular region. Subtotal surgical resection resulted in minimal improvement of the patient’s sixth nerve palsy. Postoperative radiation was undertaken. A multidisciplinary approach on an individual patient basis is recommended.

Health state preferences vary among countries, and country-specific value sets are important in health care reimbursement decisions. When decisions are made at the regional level, regional variation in health state preferences may be important. We propose that shrinkage analysis and Bland-Altman plots can be a helpful way to investigate regional variation. Methods. The presence of regional variation can be investigated by introducing interactions between regions and the regression coefficients in the scoring algorithm. When variation is present, regional scoring algorithms can be derived through shrinkage analysis. The impact of using regional algorithms in place of the national algorithm can be investigated using simulation and illustrated using Bland-Altman plots. We applied this methodological approach to the Canadian EQ-5D-5L valuation study, which used time-tradeoff (TTO) tasks to elicit health state preferences from 1073 participants from 4 regions (Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec). Results. There were statistically significant interactions between the fixed effects of the scoring algorithm and region. On computing regional scoring algorithms and applying them to the EQ-5D-5L health states reported by our population, the mean utility using the Canada-wide scoring algorithm was 0.87 (standard error, 0.0013), compared to 0.85 (0.0013) on using the algorithm for Alberta, 0.80 (0.0013) on using the algorithm for British Columbia, 0.91 (0.0013) for Ontario, and 0.89 (0.0014) for Quebec. Conclusions. When health care falls under regional jurisdiction, shrinkage estimators can be used to generate regional scoring algorithms for the EQ-5D-5L and Bland-Altman plots used to assess the importance of regional variation in health state preferences. Our results suggest that mean health state preferences vary among Canada's regions and make a sizable impact on estimates of population mean utility. ?

A caregiver's mood and anxiety level, however, may affect how he or she perceives and reports possible problems. Aims In this article, we consider the association between caregiver distress and the accuracy of the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ), a widely-used screen. Methods and procedures Our sample includes 857 parent-child dyads drawn from the Psychometric Assessment of the NDDS Study (PANS) and the NDDS Alternate Responses Study (NARS). Parents completed the ASQ and the K6, a brief measure of generalized distress. Children were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Child Development (BSID). We divided children on BSID result and used logistic regression to examine how distress influenced the ASQ's accuracy in each group. Results Of our 857 children, 9% had at least one domain below ?2 standard deviations on the BSID, and 17.3% had positive ASQ results. Caregiver distress predicted a positive ASQ substantially and significantly more strongly among BSID-positive children than among others. This translates into slightly reduced ASQ specificity but greatly improved sensitivity among caregivers with higher distress. Conclusions At low to moderate levels of distress, greater distress is associated with greater ASQ accuracy. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",ASQ; Developmental screening; Distress; Validation,"accuracy; Article; Bayley Scales of Infant Development; caregiver burden; child; child health; developmental disorder; disease severity; distress syndrome; female; human; infant; major clinical study; male; parental behavior; prediction; preschool child; psychometry; sensitivity and specificity; adult; Developmental Disabilities; mental stress; parent; psychology; questionnaire; statistical model; Adult; Child, Preschool; Developmental Disabilities; Female; Humans; Infant; Logistic Models; Male; Parents; Sensitivity and Specificity; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85013772235

Methods: Randomized controlled trials and cohort studies comparing PPIs with H2RAs in adults receiving DAPT were collected from PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane databases. Dichotomous data were pooled to obtain risk ratios (RRs) for UGIB, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), poor responders to clopidogrel and rehospitalization, and continuous data were pooled to obtain mean differences (MDs) for P2Y12 reaction units (PRUs), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Twelve clinical trials (n=3,301) met the inclusion criteria. Compared to H2RAs, PPIs lessened UGIB (RR =0.16, 95% CI: 0.03–0.70), and there was no significant difference in the incidence of PRUs (MD =18.21 PRUs, 95% CI: ?4.11–40.54), poor responders to clopidogrel (RR =1.21, 95% CI: 0.92–1.61), incidence of MACEs (RR =0.89, 95% CI: 0.45–1.75) or rehospitalization (RR =1.76, 95% CI: 0.79–3.92). Subgroup analysis confirmed fewer PRUs in the H2RAs group compared to the omeprazole group (2 studies, n=189, MD =31.80 PRUs, 95% CI: 11.65–51.96). However, poor responder data for clopidogrel and MACEs might be unreliable because few studies of this kind were included. Conclusion: Limited evidence indicates that PPIs were better than H2RAs for prophylaxis of UGIB associated with DAPT and had no effect on platelet function. Further study is needed to confirm these observations. ? 2017 Yi et al.",Dual-antiplatelet therapy; Histamine-2 receptor antagonists; Meta-analysis; Platelet function; Proton pump inhibitors; Upper gastrointestinal bleeding,acetylsalicylic acid; cimetidine; clopidogrel; esomeprazole; famotidine; lafutidine; lansoprazole; nizatidine; omeprazole; pantoprazole; rabeprazole; ranitidine; roxatidine; acute coronary syndrome; Article; case control study; cohort analysis; disease association; drug efficacy; drug safety; heart infarction; hospital readmission; human; meta analysis; platelet reactivity; prescription; randomized controlled trial (topic); retrospective study; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; systematic review; thrombocyte function; unstable angina pectoris; upper gastrointestinal bleeding,2-s2.0-85018472778

Dental service provision forms an important component of general health services for the population, but the implications of health system financing on care delivered and the financial cost of services has received relatively little attention in the research literature. The aim of this study is to evaluate the policy effect capitation payment in recently started corporate practices had on the delivery of primary oral healthcare in Northern Ireland and access to services. Methods: We analysed the policy initiative in Northern Ireland as a natural experiment to find the impact on healthcare delivery of the newly set up corporate practices that use a prospective capitation system to remunerate primary care dentists. Data was collected from GDS claim forms submitted to the Business Services Organisation (BSO) between April 2011 and October 2014. Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) practices operating within a capitation system were matched to a control group, who were remunerated using a retrospective fee-for-service system. Results: No evidence of patient selection was found in the HSCB practices set up by a corporate provider and operated under capitation. However, patients were less likely to visit the dentist and received less treatment when they did attend, compared to those belonging to the control group (P < 0.05). The extent of preventive activity offered and the patient payment charge revenue did not differ between the two practice groups. Conclusion: Although remunerating NHS primary care dentists in newly set up corporate practices using a prospective capitation system managed costs within healthcare, there is evidence that this policy may have reduced access to care of registered patients. ? 2017 The Author(s).",,control group; dental procedure; dentist; experimental model; human; Northern Ireland; patient selection; primary medical care; social care; capitation fee; economics; fee; female; health care cost; health care delivery; male; medical fee; Northern Ireland; pilot study; primary health care; prospective study; remuneration; retrospective study; statistics and numerical data; utilization; Capitation Fee; Delivery of Health Care; Dental Care; Dentists; Fee-for-Service Plans; Fees and Charges; Female; Health Expenditures; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Male; Northern Ireland; Pilot Projects; Primary Health Care; Prospective Studies; Remuneration; Retrospective Studies,2-s2.0-85014604192

Objectives: To explore the process of Palliative Care Unit (PCU) nurses' approach to bladder management changes. Methods: Nursing staff from one PCU in London, Canada were interviewed regarding bladder management care practices. A constructivist grounded theory was generated. Results: Four interconnected themes emerged: humanity (compassionate support of patients); journey (making the most of a finite timeline); health condition (illness, functional decline); and context (orders, policies, supplies). These overlapping themes must be considered in light of ongoing changes which prompt recycling through the framework. While bladder management necessitates shared decision-making and individualised care, nurses' phronetic experience may serve to detect the presence of change and the need to consider other alternatives.

Setting: Primary healthcare clinics and shopping malls in the Greater Beirut Area. Participants: 263 participants completed the questionnaire, of whom 62% were feMale and 38% were Male. Eligible participants were Arabic-speaking or English-speaking adults (age.18 years) residing in Lebanon for at least 5 years. Primary and secondary outcome measures: Awareness, attitudes and beliefs of the general public. Results: 263 out of 295 invited individuals (89% completion rate) completed the questionnaire. While the majority of participants were aware of pharmaceutical company presence (or absence) in physicians' offices (range of 71.76% across questions), smaller percentages were aware of giftrelated practices of physicians (range of 26.69% across questions). 40% thought that the acceptance of small gifts or meals by physicians is wrong/unethical. The percentage of participants reporting lower trust in physicians due to their participation in various pharmaceutical company-related activities ranged from 12% to 45% (the highest percentage being for large gifts). Participants who reported receiving free medication samples were significantly more likely to consider physicians' acceptance of small gifts as 'not a problem' than 'unethical' (OR=1.53; p=0.044). Conclusions: Participants in our survey were generally more aware of pharmaceutical company presence (or absence) in physicians' offices than of gift-related practices of physicians. While the level of trust was not affected for the majority of participants for various types of interactions, it was affected the most for accepting large gifts. ? 2017 Ammous A, et al.

To date, most hospitals have embarked on some strategies for improving environmental performance, whether it's reducing energy or landfill waste. Environmental sustainability strategies, however, can often lose momentum or stagnate if not championed by someone whose full-time role is to assess, monitor, and bring new strategies to the table. In the face of ongoing budget deficits, it is increasingly difficult to get adequate support and buy-in for this type of role unless the leadership of the organization is committed to an environmental sustainability program.

We aimed to determine the feasibility of performing advanced MR scanning (proton density [PD] weighted imaging, DTI, and 1 H-MRS) to evaluate properties of leg muscles in older women with respect to: (1) participant recruitment using three community-based strategies; (2) participant tolerance to the MRI scan acquisition protocol; and (3) scan acquisition and analyses protocols. Methods Recruitment feasibility was evaluated based on the number of participants enrolled using various strategies. Participant tolerance was feasible if the scanning session was uninterrupted and image artifacts were absent. Optimal PD imaging, DTI, and 1 H-MRS acquisition and analyses protocols were established. Results Nine women (mean age = 71 years) were recruited over four months. The acquisition protocol was well tolerated by all participants. Adaptations were required for women with short stature and vertebral fracture risk. PD-weighted image analyses were improved by using the phased array uniformity enhancement filter to increase tissue contrast. Conclusions It is feasible to use a combination of MR scanning methods to evaluate muscle macrostructure and microstructure in the leg of older women. Our findings suggest that advanced MR scanning methods can be used for future studies interested in quantifying components of muscle structure in older women, but prospective studies are needed to confirm whether change in microstructure can be detected in response to an intervention. ? 2016 Canadian Association of Medical Radiation Technologists",Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI); Lower extremity; Pilot study; Postmenopausal; Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ( 1 H-MRS),adipose tissue; aged; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; artifact; contrast enhancement; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diffusion tensor imaging; feasibility study; female; fractional anisotropy; gastrocnemius muscle; human; image analysis; image enhancement; image processing; image segmentation; intramuscular fat; lateral gastrocnemius muscle; leg muscle; medial gastrocnemius muscle; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; proton density weighted imaging; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; retrospective study; short stature; soleus muscle; spine fracture; tibialis anterior muscle; tibialis posterior muscle,2-s2.0-85005980961

Methods: We conducted a consensus-building process among the writing team to generate a list of key papers that describe the importance or significance of team collaboration, seeking input from social media sources. The authors then used a three-round voting methodology akin to a Delphi study to determine the most important papers from the initially generated list. Results: The five most important papers on the topic of team collaboration, as determined by this mixed group of junior faculty members and faculty developers, are presented in this paper. For each included publication, a summary was provided along with its relevance to junior faculty members and faculty developers. Conclusion: Five key papers about team collaboration are presented in this publication. These papers provide a foundational background to help junior faculty members with collaborating in teams both clinically and academically.

Descriptions We describe three males with normal karyotypes who presented with congenital evolving complex neurodevelopmental encephalopathies with multifaceted symptomatology of hypotonia, epilepsy, ataxia, spasticity, movement disorders, behavioral issues, severe intellectual impairment, and communication skills, and a protracted regression phase followed by stabilization. These phenotypes did not prompt us to identify atypical Rett syndrome early in childhood. Results Genetic analysis identified the two brothers with C-terminal truncation and the third male with C-terminal missense mutations. These mutations were inherited from their mothers, both of whom had incompletely characterized modest intellectual, mental health, social, and gastrointestinal impairments. Neither was independently able to care properly for their son(s). Conclusions Mutations of the MECP2 gene should be considered early in males with hypotonia, developmental delay, profound intellectual impairment, and seizures, associated with a mother with psychosocial, cognitive, and gastrointestinal impairments.

In this study, integration of BS and computed tomography scan was used to assess progression of disease in bones. This metric might more adequately capture bone progression and predict OS. Background Progression of bone metastasis in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is assessed using bone scan (BS) and correlates modestly with overall survival (OS). Because of the poor reliability of BS and routinely performed computed tomography (CT) scans, we assessed bone progression by integrating BS and CT. Patients and Methods Data were obtained from patients receiving docetaxel chemotherapy or postdocetaxel orteronel with baseline and on-therapy CT and BS within 90 days. Imaging underwent central radiology review by a single dedicated radiologist. Progressive disease (PD) was defined as &#x2265; 1 new lesion on either BS or CT. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to explore potential prognosticators of OS. Results Twenty-eight patients were evaluable. The mean age was 71.4 years and median OS was 18.4 (range, 9.7-35.4) months. Four patients (14.3%) had PD on BS and CT scan, and 2 (7.1%) had PD on CT scan but not on BS, and 3 (10.7%) had PD on BS but not CT scan. Patients with PD on BS or CT scan had worse OS (hazard ratio [HR], 2.68; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.04-6.90; P = .041) than those with no PD on either CT or BS. When examining individual lesions, 4 patients had &#x2265; 1 new lesion identified on CT but not BS, and they were associated with worse OS (HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 1.01-13.66; P = .048). No significant difference in OS was observed for 4 patients with new lesions on BS but not CT scan. Conclusion Results of this hypothesis-generating study suggest that the integration of &#x2265; 1 new lesion on CT and/or BS within 90 days in mCRPC might better capture bone progression and predict OS. This composite metric needs to be compared with current criteria. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Bone scan; Castration-resistant prostate cancer; Computerized tomography; Metastatic; Overall survival,"atrasentan; docetaxel; orteronel; placebo; prednisone; antineoplastic agent; docetaxel; taxoid; adult; aged; bone metastasis; bone scintiscanning; castration resistant prostate cancer; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; Conference Paper; disease course; follow up; human; male; overall survival; bone; Bone Neoplasms; diagnostic imaging; disease free survival; middle aged; multimodal imaging; procedures; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; secondary; survival analysis; treatment outcome; very elderly; x-ray computed tomography; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antineoplastic Agents; Bone and Bones; Bone Neoplasms; Disease Progression; Disease-Free Survival; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multimodal Imaging; Prostatic Neoplasms, Castration-Resistant; Survival Analysis; Taxoids; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85006365407

This is partly attributed to historical experiences as well as their cultural beliefs. Cultural beliefs about the uses of breast milk/fluids could further hinder the participation of African, Caribbean, and Black communities in research involving the collection of breast milk/fluids samples. Methods: We conducted 17 in-depth interviews and three group interviews (n = 10) with HIV+ African, Caribbean and Black women living in Ontario, Canada to explore their cultural beliefs about breast milk/fluids and their acceptance of participating in research that involves the provision of breast fluid samples. Study design: Qualitative study involving in-depth interviews. Results: Our respondents believed that breast milk/fluids should be used for infant feeding and for curative purposes for a variety of children's health ailments as well as ailments experienced by other family members. The cultural belief that breast milk/fluids could be used to bewitch the baby and mother and the perception that it is intrusive (equating breast milk/fluids research to DNA testing), could prevent African, Caribbean and Black women from participating in research involving the collection of breast milk/fluids. Despite these fears, some respondents expressed that they would participate if the research results would benefit them directly, for example, by finding a cure for HIV, enabling HIV+ mothers to breastfeed, or contributing to developing new drugs or vaccines for HIV. Women's recommendations to facilitate successful recruitment included giving incentives to participants, and employing a recruiter who was trustworthy, informed, and culturally sensitive. Conclusion: Cultural beliefs could present barriers to recruitment and participation of Africa, Caribbean and Black communities in health research involving breast milk/fluid samples. Successful recruitment for future studies would necessitate researchers to be culturally aware of the beliefs held by African, Caribbean and Black women, to build trust, and use an appropriate recruiter. While the findings relate to breast milk/fluids, the suggested recommendations for facilitating recruitment of research participants from these communities may be useful to consider when recruiting ethnically and culturally similar participants for research involving biological samples. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Afro-Caribbean and Black women; Breast milk/fluid samples; Cultural beliefs; Participation in research; Racial/ethnic groups,"adult; Africa; African American; attitude to health; Black person; breast feeding; breast milk; Caribbean; clinical trial; cultural factor; ethnic group; ethnology; female; HIV Seropositivity; human; interview; middle aged; multicenter study; Ontario; patient participation; qualitative research; Adult; Africa; African Americans; African Continental Ancestry Group; Attitude to Health; Breast Feeding; Caribbean Region; Cultural Characteristics; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Seropositivity; Humans; Interviews as Topic; Middle Aged; Milk, Human; Ontario; Patient Participation; Qualitative Research",2-s2.0-85009962811

Guidelines recommend annual screening with pulmonary function testing (PFT) and transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). Through auditing the charts of 11 rheumatologists associated with McMaster University, we evaluated the proportion of SSc patients without PAH or pulmonary fibrosis who receive annual TTE, PFT, and dyspnea screening. Screening rates between self-identified SSc experts and non-experts were compared. In cases where screening tests were abnormal, charts were reviewed for evidence of cardiologist or respirologist referral. In total, 136 patients’ charts were included. Annual screening for dyspnea was very common (88% of patients, 119/134). Annual PAH screening via TTE (74%, 100/135) and PFT (79%, 107/136) was less common. Annual dyspnea screening, TTE, and PFT were more commonly performed by SSc experts than by non-experts (94% vs. 83%, p = 0.03; 85% vs. 61%, p = 0.002; 93% vs. 62%, p<0.001, respectively). Nearly all patients with an abnormal TTE (10/11, 91%) and PFT (12/14, 86%) received appropriate referrals. Future research should explore reasons for differences in screening rates between SSc experts and non-experts. Given that rheumatologists screen for dyspnea more often than they order PFT and TTE, there may be barriers to ordering these tests that warrant further investigation. ? 2017 Wichtig International.",Echocardiogram; Pulmonary arterial hypertension; Pulmonary function test; Scleroderma; Screening; Systemic sclerosis,Article; computer assisted tomography; dyspnea; echocardiography; follow up; heart catheterization; human; interstitial lung disease; lung diffusion capacity; lung function test; major clinical study; prevalence; pulmonary hypertension; screening test; systemic sclerosis; systolic blood pressure; transthoracic echocardiography,2-s2.0-85063243128

Alternative options such as surgery and ablation exist but are not appropriate treatment plans for some patients. Neurostimulation methods such as vagal nerve stimulation, responsive neural stimulation, and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are viable alternatives for medically refractory patients. DBS stimulation has been used in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, dystonia, and pain management. For the treatment of epilepsy, DBS has been found to be an effective treatment plan, with promising results of reduced seizure frequency and intensity. In this review, we discuss DBS surgery and equipment, mechanisms of DBS for epilepsy, and efficacy, technological specifications, and suggestions for future research. We also review a historical summary of experiments involving DBS for epilepsy.

Their common A chain mediates the toxigenic mechanism by causing ADP ribosylation of G proteins and subsequent elevation of cAMP in target cells. A large IgA and IgG antibody response to admixed protein antigen (Ag) is the hallmark of these adjuvants and is clearly associated with the A chain activity. Expansion of Ag-specific B and T cells, alteration of T cell cytokine production, and changes in regulatory T cells have been reported as adjuvant mechanisms. The B chain derivatives of these toxins can also weakly enhance immune response, especially if covalently associated with Ag and used for nasophyrangeal immunization. Importantly, these toxins or their B chain derivatives can alter the normal immune regulation that produces oral tolerance. This indicates that they modulate mechanisms operative between the mucosal and systemic immune systems. There are some discrepancies between in vitro models of CT or LT activity and in vivo manifestations of their adjuvant activities. Interpretation of current data regarding in vivo mechanism is hampered by an incomplete understanding of how mucosal B and T cells can interact with systemic lymphoid tissue and vice versa. More important, there is no clear understanding of the early effects of the toxins on the local (and draining) mucosal lymphoid tissues. This is especially true in the critical areas of antigen presentation, T and B cell activation, and cytokine production. ? 2017 by Begell House, Inc.",CAMP; Cholera toxin; Heat-labile toxin; Mucosal immunity,"adjuvant; cholera toxin; cyclic AMP; enterotoxin; guanine nucleotide binding protein; heat labile toxin; immunoglobulin A antibody; immunoglobulin G antibody; unclassified drug; cyclic AMP; cytokine; enterotoxin; guanine nucleotide binding protein; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; immunological adjuvant; adenosine diphosphate ribosylation; antibody production; antigen presentation; Article; B lymphocyte activation; carboxy terminal sequence; cell proliferation; cell surface; cytokine production; disulfide bond; human; immune response; immunocompetent cell; immunoglobulin class switching; immunoregulation; in vitro study; in vivo study; mucosal immunity; nonhuman; priority journal; regulatory T lymphocyte; signal transduction; T lymphocyte activation; target cell; Th2 cell; adenosine diphosphate ribosylation; animal; B lymphocyte; drug effect; immunology; lymphocyte activation; lymphoid tissue; metabolism; mucosal immunity; T lymphocyte; Adjuvants, Immunologic; ADP-Ribosylation; Animals; Antigen Presentation; B-Lymphocytes; Cyclic AMP; Cytokines; Enterotoxins; GTP-Binding Proteins; Humans; Immunity, Mucosal; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; Lymphocyte Activation; Lymphoid Tissue; T-Lymphocytes",2-s2.0-85059235943

NPs worked with an average of 3.4 MDs, ranging from 1-26 MDs. The most common reasons for collaborating included managing acute and chronic conditions, and updating MDs on resident status changes. Satisfaction with NP-MD collaboration was high, and did not significantly differ among NPs working full versus part time, NPs working in a single versus multiple homes, or NPs with more versus less experience. By understanding the nature of NP-MD collaboration, we can identify ways of supporting and enhancing collaboration between these professionals. ? 2017 Longwoods Publishing.",,adult; aged; Canada; cooperation; doctor nurse relation; female; health care delivery; health personnel attitude; human; long term care; male; middle aged; nurse attitude; nurse practitioner; organization and management; primary health care; psychology; questionnaire; residential home; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Canada; Cooperative Behavior; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Middle Aged; Nurse Practitioners; Nurse's Role; Physician-Nurse Relations; Primary Health Care; Residential Facilities; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85056643912

Objective: Extract diagnostic rate (DR) information from free text surgical pathology reports with synoptic elements and assess whether inter-rater variation and clinical history completeness information useful for continuous quality improvement (CQI) can be obtained. Methods: All in-house prostate biopsies in a 6-year period at two large teaching hospitals were extracted and then diagnostically categorized using string matching, fuzzy string matching, and hierarchical pruning. DRs were then stratified by the submitting physicians and pathologists. Funnel plots were created to assess for diagnostic bias. Results: 3,854 prostate biopsies were found and all could be diagnostically classified. Two audits involving the review of 700 reports and a comparison of the synoptic elements with the free text interpretations suggest a categorization error rate of <1%. Twenty-seven pathologists each read >40 cases and together assessed 3,690 biopsies.

Objective The objective was to estimate the strength of association between the number of pharmacies a patient frequents and adherence to statins. Methods Using administrative data from the Nova Scotia Seniors’ Pharmacare program, a retrospective cohort study was conducted among subjects aged 65 years and older first dispensed a statin between 1998 and 2008. The Usual Provider of Care (UPC), was defined as the number of dispensation days from the most frequented pharmacy divided by the total number of dispensation days. Adherence was defined as a Medication Possession Ratio of 80% or greater. Data were analyzed using hierarchical linear regression. Results The cohort of 25,641 subjects was 59% female with a mean age of 74 years. During follow-up, subjects filled prescriptions in a median of 2 (mean = 2; standard deviation = 0.88) pharmacies and visited pharmacies a median of 28 (mean = 30) times. During that time, 61% of patients used one pharmacy exclusively. Among subjects using 1 pharmacy, 59% were adherent while 58% using more than one pharmacy were adherent. However, upon adjustment for differences in distributions of age, sex, and other confounders, subjects who used more than one pharmacy had 10% decreased odds of statin adherence (odds ratio: 0.90, 95% confidence interval: 0.86–0.96). These results were robust in sensitivity analyses. Conclusions Among seniors newly starting statin therapy, using a single community pharmacy was modestly associated with adherence. ? 2017 Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology.

Primary care electronic medical record (EMR) databases offer opportunities to examine referral patterns. Until recently, software techniques were not available to model these kinds of multi-level count data. Objective To establish methodology for determining referral rates from FPs to medical specialists using the Canadian Primary Care Sentinel Surveillance Network (CPCSSN) EMR database. Method Retrospective cohort study, mixed effects and multi-level negative binomial regression modelling with 87,258 eligible patients between 2007 and 2012. Mean referrals compared by patient sex, age, chronic conditions, FP visits, and urban/rural practice location. Proportion of variance in referral rates attributable to the patient and practice levels. Results On average, males had 0.26 and females had 0.31 referrals in a 12-month period. Referrals were significantly higher for females, increased with age, FP visits and the number of chronic conditions (p < 0.0001). Overall, 14% of the variance in referrals could be attributed to the practice level, and 86% to patient level characteristics. Conclusions Both the patient and practice characteristics influenced referral patterns. The methodologic insights gained from this study have relevance to future studies on many research questions that utilise count data, both within primary care and broader health services research.

We investigate how these differences influence DOAC utilization and expenditure across the country. Methods: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study of all out-patient prescriptions for OACs dispensed to public beneficiaries between January 1, 2010, and June 30, 2015. We calculated quarterly rates of OAC use and expenditures stratified by OAC type and province. Results: The greatest increase in quarterly rates of DOAC utilization occurred in provinces with more liberal mechanism of drug coverage: Ontario by 462%, Alberta by 425% and Quebec by 1,924%. This translated to increased expenditure on overall OAC by 270%, 204% and 390%, respectively. In contrast, provinces with more stringent mechanisms had low rates of DOAC utilization and expenditure. Conclusions: DOAC utilization and expenditure is considerably different across Canada, associated with provincial difference in reimbursement mechanism.",,"anticoagulant agent; apixaban; dabigatran; direct acting oral anticoagulant; rivaroxaban; unclassified drug; warfarin; anticoagulant agent; Canada; cross-sectional study; drug formulary; drug information; drug mechanism; drug program; drug utilization; human; outpatient care; prescription; reimbursement; Review; economics; health care cost; oral drug administration; statistics and numerical data; Administration, Oral; Anticoagulants; Canada; Cross-Sectional Studies; Health Expenditures; Humans; Reimbursement Mechanisms",2-s2.0-85038971814

It looked at patient comfort and aspects of treatment that patients would like to see improved which were amenable to an engineering solution. Methods: The results were obtained from 12 patients at the Scarborough General Hospital's dialysis centre located at 78 Corporate Drive, Scarborough, Ontario. Results: The significant areas of concern identified were discomfort, wait times, and blood clotting, with 7/12 patients indicating distress associated with treatment, 7/12 patients expressing discontent with current wait times and 8/11 patients reporting instances of blood clotting. Conclusion: Novel methods to combat blood clotting and alleviate the discomfort associated with vascular access are proposed. In order to address concerns with wait times and blood clotting, an integrated polymer based solution was developed. This approach is based on the multitude of properties achievable with the combination of polymers into a film and the surface modifier antithrombin-heparin (ATH) covalent complex. By utilizing a self-assembling and degradable film deposited as a coating on the portion of dialysis units which come into contact with a patient's blood, the disinfecting and cleaning operations can be greatly improved while reducing the possibility of thrombotic complications.

Methods: This was a qualitative study. Ten health professionals working in trauma care at GPHC participated voluntarily. Participants filled out an anonymous questionnaire using the components of SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis, and took part in a focus group discussion. Two researchers reviewed the qualitative data individually. Coding was agreed upon and data reduction occurred. Results: The SWOT questionnaires identified a lack of material and human resources as barriers to optimal care during trauma scenarios. The focus group discussion identified issues related to team communication, cooperation, organization and training. Participants acknowledged the need to address hierarchies and pre-existing attitudes between different health professionals. They agreed that to maintain consistency in performance and patient care, the trauma team training (TTT) course or an equivalent should be mandatory for all team members. Conclusions: Qualitative feedback from trauma team members revealed that poor inter-professional communication and limited teamwork skills are considered major barriers to optimal team performance in trauma scenarios at GPHC.

Elective coronary interventional procedures are often overused and sometimes inappropriately used. The incentives for overuse are greater in low- and middle-income countries, where much of healthcare is provided by poorly regulated, fee-for-service systems. Overuse and inappropriate use increase healthcare costs and are potentially harmful to patients. Linking appropriate use of elective procedures to their reimbursement might deter overuse. Methods. We explored the feasibility of introducing appropriateness criteria as a precondition to settling reimbursement claims in a publicly funded health insurance scheme in Maharashtra, India. Clinical algorithms were developed from the current best-practice criteria and used to determine appropriateness at the time of obtaining pre-authorization for elective percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgeries. The number of PCIs as a proportion of the total number of procedures reimbursed under the scheme was the primary outcome measure. This proportion was compared for 1-year periods before and after implementation of appropriateness-based reimbursement, using the chi-square test. Comparisons were also made separately for public and private hospitals. The change in the proportion of CABG surgeries over the same time periods was used as a comparator (as they are less subject to inappropriate use). Results. The insurance scheme provided cover to a population of 20 424 585 (18.2% of the population of Maharashtra) in 8 districts, through 106 hospitals (73 private and 33 public). There was a 12.3% (95% CI 8.9%–15.5%, p=0.0001) reduction in the proportion of PCIs performed in the 1-year period after the introduction of appropriateness-based reimbursement. The reduction was similar for public and private hospitals. There was no significant change in the proportion of CABG surgeries (2.3% v. 2.2%, p=0.20). At current rates, use of appropriateness-based reimbursement would result in approximately 783 (95% CI 483–1099) less PCIs with potential annual savings of about 57 million (US$ 0.93 million; 95% CI 0.57–1.3) to the government scheme. Conclusions. It seems feasible to implement an appropriateness-based system for reimbursement of elective coronary interventional procedures in a government-funded health insurance scheme in a developing country. This potentially cost-saving approach may reduce inappropriate use. ?

A catabolic state in trauma patients may hinder recovery and inadequate nutrition may increase morbidity, mortality and length of hospital stay. The purpose of this paper is to review the current nutrition support practices for pediatric trauma patients at McMaster Children’s Hospital (MCH), describe patient demographics and identify areas to improve the quality of patient care. Design/methodology/approach: A retrospective chart review was conducted on pediatric trauma patients (age<18 years) identified through the trauma registry of MCH. Pediatric trauma patients admitted from January 2010 to March 2014 with an Injury Severity Score (ISS)=12 and a hospitalization of =24 hours were included. Findings: In total, 130 patients were included in this study, 61.1 percent male, median age ten years (range: 0-17 years) and median ISS of 17 (range: 12-50). Blunt trauma accounted for 97.7 percent of patients admitted and 73.3 percent had trauma team activation. In total, 93 patients (71.5 percent) had ICU stays. The median time to feed was 29 hours (interquartile range: 12.5-43 hours) from the time of admission. An increased hospital length of stay was associated with longer time to initiation of nutrition support, a higher ISS and greater number of surgeries (p<0.05). Originality/value: Local nutritional support practices for pediatric trauma patients correspond with recommended principles of early feeding and preferential enteral nutrition. Harmonization of paper-based and electronic data collection is recommended to ensure that prescribed nutritional support is being delivered and nutritional needs of pediatric trauma patients are being met. ? 2017, ?

Although newborn deaths and stillbirths have decreased notably in the OPT across the Millennium Development Goal era (MDG), the OPT continues to have higher neonatal mortality when compared to its culturally similar neighboring countries (Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria). Whilst information on the exact causes of neonatal death is unavailable, the major causes of neonatal death in general are largely preventable with proven cost-effective interventions. Our analysis of life-saving interventions across the continuum of care found high coverage (>90%) in antenatal care, skilled birth attendance and postnatal care in the OPT. Suboptimal levels of coverage were noted for contraceptive use and early initiation/exclusive breastfeeding, while prevalence of caesarean section births was high. Moreover, access to improved drinking water sources in the Gaza Strip was alarmingly low (~10%). Differences according to wealth quintile, maternal education, subnational region in the OPT, and area of residence (urban, rural, or refugee camp) were minimal, except across the different governorates which varied according to indicator, governorates in Gaza typically performed poorer than those in West Bank. Evidence suggests that social determinants such as empowerment of females may be poor in the OPT; efforts to improve this should be encouraged to promote health care seeking behavior and utilization of public health services among girls and women. Governance in the OPT remains unstable and deficiencies may be detrimental to attaining the peace and security needed to maintain sound health care systems - a focus on achieving stable and effective governance in the OPT is paramount. Out-of-pocket expenditures for health are high (~40%) in the OPT and should be reduced to encourage affordable health care for vulnerable and impoverished civilians. Effective policies and strategies to improve health and survival of women and children have been adopted and endorsed in the OPT, although information on their implementation is limited. OPT appears to be adequately stocked in health workers while a shortage in neonatologists has been noted. The current state of health care provision is largely dependent on external funding and operational support, thus long-term sustainable strategizing for human resource staffing is required in the OPT. To successfully reduce preventable fetal and newborn deaths, Palestinian and international organizations must focus on increasing the allocation of resources into examining and implementing specific programmes for advancements in maternal and neonatal health. Though progress has been made in the OPT, much remains to be done. Chronic instability and conflict has an adverse impact on all aspects of the health care continuum in the OPT, particularly in areas of Gaza which has been most affected by conflict. For long-term and consistent improvement in maternal and neonatal health, it is critical that the state government, civil society and international community maximize efforts in restoring peace and stability in the OPT. ? 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Our outpatient palliative care oncology clinic has experienced an increase in interest from patients to incorporate medical cannabis into their symptom management. The aim of this chapter is to better understand the demographics, diagnosis, and symptom profile of patients with advanced cancer accessing medical cannabis. Methods: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of patients accessing medical cannabis at an academic tertiary Symptom Management Clinic for a seven month study period in 2014. Results: Of approximately 340 patients seen in clinic, 43 patients (12.5%) were identified as having obtained authorization for medical cannabis. Patients were predominantly older with 74.4% of patients aged 51-75 years, and 4.7% of patients were over 75 years of age. They had a wide variety of cancer diagnosis, of which GI maligancies (30%) and lung cancer (20.9%) were the most common. Patients experienced a multitude of symptoms with pain being the most common (88.4%), followed by fatigue, nausea and lack of appetite. Of note, a significant number (39.5%) reported already using medical cannabsi at the time of lisencing. Conclusions: The field of medical cannabis use is young and much work still needs to be done to understand its place amongst symptom management in general and in palliative patients specifically. This small retrospective study describes a cohort of pallaitive cancer patients who accessed medical cannabis to manage a variety of symptoms. ? 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

The overall proportion of cases with at least one inconsistent response in the two editions was 11.7% (2.7% on the alcohol items, 2.1% for drug use, 4.3% for cigarette use, 3% for sexual activity) and 22.7% (12.8% on alcohol items, 2.5% for drug use, 4.3% for cigarette use, 4.1% for sexual activity), respectively. Such inconsistency was more prevalent among males, delayed students, those who reported having experimented with drugs, and those who did not have a cellphone. Because inconsistent responses were more prevalent among the students who claimed to have engaged in risky activities, removing inconsistent responders affected the estimated prevalence of all risk behaviors in both editions of the survey. This study supports the importance of performing consistency checks of self-report surveys, following the growing body of literature on this topic. ? 2017, Fundacao Oswaldo Cruz.

Relatively little is known about the process by which such tests are adopted into oncology practice. The objectives of the present study were to understand the experiences of medical oncologists with multigene expression profile (gep) tests, including their adoption into practice in early-stage breast cancer, and the perceptions of the oncologists about the influence of test results on treatment decision-making. Methods We conducted a qualitative descriptive study involving interviews with medical oncologists from academic and community cancer centres or hospitals in 8 communities in Ontario. A 21-gene breast cancer assay was used as the example of gep testing. Qualitative analytic techniques were used to identify the main themes. Results Of 28 oncologists who were approached, 21 (75%) participated in the study [median age: 43 years; 12 women (57%)]. Awareness and knowledge of gep testing were derived from several sources: international scientific meetings, participation in clinical studies, discussions with respected colleagues, and manufacturer-sponsored meetings. Oncologists observed that incorporating gep testing into their clinical practice resulted in several changes, including longer consultation times, second visits, and taking steps to minimize treatment delays. Oncologists expressed divergent opinions about the strength of evidence and added value of gep testing in guiding treatment decisions. Conclusions Incorporation of gep testing into clinical practice in early-stage breast cancer required oncologists to make changes to their usual routines. The opinions of oncologists about the quality of evidence underpinning the test affected how much weight they gave to test results in treatment decision-making. ? 2017 Multimed Inc.",Breast cancer; Decision-making; Gene expression profile testing,estrogen receptor; progesterone receptor; adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; clinical decision making; clinical practice; community care; demography; descriptive research; female; gene expression assay; health program; human; interview; learning; major clinical study; male; medical society; middle aged; oncologist; personalized medicine; qualitative analysis; research,2-s2.0-85018359860

Methods This retrospective longitudinal cohort study, conducted by chart review, analyzed anonymized patient records from two cancer centres in Ontario. Comprehensive records of 86 patients meeting the inclusion criteria were used to obtain resource utilization, which, multiplied by unit costs, were used to determine overall and mean costs. Descriptive statistics are presented for patient demographics, medical resource utilization, and costing data. Results The total cost for the cohort was 2.2 million over a mean follow-up period of 4.7 years. The mean total cost per patient (regardless of follow-up) was 25,736. In terms of Rai staging, overall mean costs were highest for stage iv patients. Almost 50% of the total cost was attributable to cll treatments, among which fludarabine-based treatments had the highest utilization. Conclusions For this Canadian cll cohort, medical resource utilization and costs were determined to be 2.2 million, with cll treatments accounting for about half the cost. Costs generally increased with Rai stage. ? 2017 Multimed Inc.",Canada; Chronic lymphocytic leukemia; Costs; Utilization,chlorambucil; fludarabine; adult; aged; Article; cancer mortality; cancer staging; chronic lymphatic leukemia; cohort analysis; female; health care cost; health care utilization; human; leukemia relapse; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; medical record review; Ontario; retrospective study,2-s2.0-85014436843

Objectives This study is an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to establish validity and reliability of the instrument subscales. Methods EFA on the UW-QOL–RTOG modification was conducted using baseline data from NRG Oncology's RTOG 0537, a trial of acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation in treating radiation-induced xerostomia. Cronbach α coefficient was calculated to measure reliability; correlation with the University of Michigan Xerostomia Related Quality of Life Scale was used to evaluate concurrent validity; and correlations between consecutive time points were used to assess test-retest reliability. Results The 15-item EFA of the modified tool resulted in 11 items split into four factors: mucus, eating, pain, and activities. Cronbach α ranged from 0.71 to 0.93 for the factors and total score, consisting of all 11 items. There were strong correlations (ρ???0.60) between consecutive time points and between total score and the Xerostomia Related Quality of Life Scale total score (ρ?>?0.65). Conclusion The UW-QOL–RTOG modification is a valid tool that can be used to assess symptom burden of head and neck cancer patients receiving radiation therapy or those who have recently completed radiation. The modified tool has acceptable reliability, concurrent validity, and test-retest reliability in this patient population, as well as the advantage of having being shortened from 15 to 11 items. ? 2016 American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine",factor analysis; Quality of life; xerostomia,"acupuncture; adult; Article; cancer radiotherapy; concurrent validity; Cronbach alpha coefficient; eating; exploratory factor analysis; female; head and neck cancer; human; major clinical study; male; mouth pain; pain; quality of life assessment; radiation induced xerostomia; recreation; sore throat; swallowing; test retest reliability; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; University of Washington Quality of Life Questionnaire Radiation Therapy Oncology Group; xerostomia; aged; complication; daily life activity; factor analysis; head and neck tumor; middle aged; pain; psychology; quality of life; questionnaire; Activities of Daily Living; Aged; Eating; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pain; Quality of Life; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85007090205

Our study identifies patient and tumor characteristics that guide the use of adjuvant radiation therapy and evaluates our adherence to recommended guidelines. A retrospective review was undertaken of 1,667 stage I–III breast cancer patients treated at a regional cancer center from 2004 to 2007. Univariate analysis was used to select factors for entry into a multivariate stepwise logistic regression model. Descriptive statistics was used to compare use of radiation therapy of 382 stage I–III breast cancer patients diagnosed in 2013 to those from 2004 to 2007. The primary indicators for any radiation therapy (n = 935) were breast conserving surgery (OR 79.5, 95% CI [47.6–132.9]), four to nine positive lymph nodes (71.9, [17.0–304.7]), and greater than nine positive lymph nodes (60.5, [7.9–460.8]). In post-mastectomy patients (n = 408), the indicators for radiation therapy were four to nine positive lymph nodes (29.4, [12.9–67.4]) and greater than nine positive lymph nodes (108.3, [14.5–807.5]). In breast conserving surgery patients (n = 1,081) 96.1% were offered radiation therapy. Patients offered local-regional radiation therapy were more likely to have any positive nodes (ORs 4.3–91.0), have had a mastectomy (4.3, [2.2–8.4]), and had larger tumors (1.6, [1.3–2.0]). Local-regional radiation therapy was recommended less frequently in node positive patients in 2004–2007 (35.0%) compared to in 2013 (70.5%) [p < 0.001]. Patients who had a breast conserving surgery or had four or more positive lymph nodes were more likely to receive radiation therapy. Patients with any positive lymph nodes, larger tumors, or who had a mastectomy were more likely to receive local-regional radiation therapy. Our institution was more likely to offer local-regional radiation therapy in node positive breast cancer in 2013 compare to 2004–2007. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",breast cancer; radiation; regression model; risk stratification,"adjuvant radiotherapy; adult; Article; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; cancer staging; cancer surgery; clinical decision making; clinical feature; cross-sectional study; female; human; lymph node; major clinical study; middle aged; partial mastectomy; practice guideline; primary tumor; protocol compliance; retrospective study; tumor volume; adjuvant radiotherapy; aged; Breast Neoplasms; lymph node metastasis; pathology; procedures; sentinel lymph node biopsy; statistical model; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Lymph Nodes; Lymphatic Metastasis; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Retrospective Studies; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy",2-s2.0-84994802476

Intra-articular hyaluronic acid (IA-HA) is a treatment modality that provides a minimally invasive treatment option for the management of osteoarthritis-related symptoms. This study examined the current and potential economic impact of using a biologically derived, high molecular weight hyaluronic acid preparation (Euflexxa) on the US population for the management of knee osteoarthritis. Methods: A model was developed to estimate the total number of patients with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis in the US in 2015, distributed by Kellgren–Lawrence (K–L) grade, and the number of people living with total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The potential utility of Euflexxa was applied to this model population to determine the current and potential impact of the treatment as the total number of quality adjusted life years (QALY) saved within the US population. Results: There are approximately 12 million people currently suffering from symptomatic knee osteoarthritis in the US, and approximately 5 million living with TKA. It was estimated that, with a target treatment group of K–L grades 2–3, there are approximately 4 million patients eligible for treatment with a high molecular weight intra-articular hyaluronic acid injection. With current use, it is estimated that Euflexxa can save 36,730?QALY/year among the US population, and has the potential to save an additional 369,181?QALY/year if used by all eligible patients. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that more widely used, biologically derived, high molecular weight IA-HAs, such as Euflexxa, have the potential to save a substantial number of QALYs among the US population with symptomatic knee osteoarthritis.

Quality controls are essential for staining interpretation. The most common controls are cut from the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue blocks in advance. In contrast, we developed paraffin-embedded tissue fragment suspension (PETFS), a novel method in liquid form, for quality control preparation. The liquid form controls were cut from the donor formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded paraffin blocks, stored in the 4°C fridge easily, and added to the top and bottom of the test slide directly by pipetting. The tissue fragments from the PETFS had a comparable IHC staining pattern to that of the control sections from the original donor blocks. Over a 180-day testing period, the IHC staining pattern and intensity remained strong and specific. The clinical value of PETFS method was further validated by their successful application as controls for the expression of estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, and C-erbB-2 in 240 breast invasive ductal carcinomas. We concluded that PETFS is a fast, low-cost, and less donor tissue consumption robust technique as quality controls for routine IHC staining in surgical pathologic practice.

In the United States, the cost of environmentally related public health concerns is estimated as greater than $55 billion. Environmental exposure is among parents' top health concerns for children. Yet, the study of the effects of environmental exposure on health outcomes is a developing field, and clinicians feel inadequately prepared to address these concerns. The Children's Environmental Health Clinic (ChEHC) is the first clinic of its kind in Canada. Their website includes a list of online resources on major topics related to child health and the environment. There has not yet been an objective evaluation of the comprehensiveness of the topics or scientific quality of the information on the website. This study seeks to offer an accessible introduction to the field of environmental pediatrics, including an online resource for evidence- based information on key topics in the field. These resources assist in disease prevention, health promotion, education, and the increasing need to balance environmental health risks. Methods: A scoping review of scientific and gray literature in the field of environmental pediatrics was performed to inform a written introduction to the field and to identify gaps in the content of the ChEHC website. The content of the ChEHC website was then objectively evaluated using the National Network of Libraries of Medicine checklist for health websites. Results: Ten categories within the field of environmental pediatrics emerged from the literature review. A small number of gaps were identified on the website and in the literature. The content of the ChEHC website was found to be of high quality. Future directions: The website will be updated using the results of the study as a guide, to make it as relevant, complete, and evidence-based as possible. Conclusions: Environmental pediatrics is an important, emerging topic. There is a need for accessible, evidencebased pediatric environmental health resources for clinicians and the general public. The products of this study (a publication and website) respond to that need and thus assist in disease prevention and health promotion. ? 2016 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",environmental health; pediatrics; toxic environmental substances,"Canada; child; child health; communicable disease control; education; environmental health; health promotion; health status indicator; human; pediatrics; preschool child; procedures; Canada; Child; Child Health; Child, Preschool; Communicable Disease Control; Environmental Health; Health Promotion; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Pediatrics",2-s2.0-85002374014

Materials and methods: We used a hypothetical population at high risk of cardiovascular disease events from three risk assessment models including the Framingham risk function, the Score Canada and the Pooled Cohort Risk Assessment Equations. Our source population were all 55-year-old smoking men with diabetes, hypertension and low HDL. From this population, we identified two different subpopulations named “high” and “low”, referring to their cholesterol levels which were set at 8.60 and 4.14 mmol/L respectively. Both subpopulations were identified for each risk assessment model in order to estimate the maximal impact of lowering cholesterol on cardiovascular disease events. Results: Our extrapolations estimated that the maximal theoretical efficacy of a cholesterol-lowering intervention corresponds to a risk ratio ranging between 0.46 and 0.66 over a 10-year period. The number of events prevented during this period were between 21 and 29 per 100 patients which corresponds to a number needed to treat varying from 3.47 to 4.76. Conclusions: Our estimation showed the maximal clinical benefit that could be reasonably expected by an intervention that would lower total cholesterol in high-risk patients. ? 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Cardiovascular disease; Cholesterol; High-risk; Maximal clinical benefit; Primary prevention; Risk assessment,"cholesterol; high density lipoprotein; hypocholesterolemic agent; adult; Article; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cholesterol blood level; diabetes mellitus; female; Framingham risk score; high risk population; human; hypertension; lipoprotein blood level; major clinical study; male; middle aged; primary prevention; risk assessment; smoking; Cardiovascular Diseases; procedures; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Anticholesteremic Agents; Cardiovascular Diseases; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Primary Prevention; Risk Assessment",2-s2.0-84988311443

Assess psychometric properties of the proposed tool. Evaluate feasibility and utility of the tool. Introduction Trauma resuscitation is a structured and complex process involving unique sets of skills. There is currently no published structured formative evaluation tool for trauma trainees. Therefore, many trauma trainees rely upon limited, unstructured feedback on their performance. We developed a tool to assess trainee performance while leading a trauma resuscitation and to assist faculty in providing trainee feedback after the encounter. Methods This study was conducted in a level I trauma centre in Ontario, Canada. Principles of learning theories, literature review, and clinical expert opinions were used to design a tool to assess clinical competence required to lead the resuscitation. In total, 5 critical domains were identified. High-fidelity simulation-based environment was used to test interrater reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients. To gauge feasibility, practicality, and utility of the tool, an online survey was sent to raters and trainees at the end of the study. Results We found “excellent” agreement for “initial critical assessment” domain (0.80) and “moderate to good” agreement for the “communication and leadership” (0.67) and “clinical performance” domains (0.53). “Poor” agreement was identified for the “decision-making” domain (0.33). The coefficients for individual items reached “good” agreement for 5 items, and “moderate” agreement for 8 items. Intraclass correlation coefficients for the remaining 7 items were “fair” or “poor.” Most raters agreed that items in the medical training domain were not applicable. Feedback from raters and trainees confirmed the feasibility and acceptability of the tool for formative feedback, in addition to some suggestions to enhance the tool. Conclusion MacTrauma TTL assessment tool is a novel tool for formative feedback for trainees’ performance during trauma resuscitation. Initial psychometric property testing is promising. Further reliability and validity testing of the modified tool is needed. The tool has been shown to be feasible and acceptable by both trainees and faculty as a formative assessment tool. ? 2016 Association of Program Directors in Surgery",assessment; evaluation; Interpersonal and Communication Skills; Medical Knowledge; Patient Care; performance; Practice-Based Learning and Improvement; simulation; Systems-Based Practice; trauma,"adult; Article; Canada; clinical competence; constructive feedback; decision making; feedback system; human; interpersonal communication; interrater reliability; leadership; learning theory; MacTRAUMA TTL Assessment Tool; medical education; performance; performance measurement system; priority journal; psychometry; reliability; resuscitation; simulation; student; trauma resuscitation; validity; clinical competence; comparative study; cross-sectional study; education; emergency health service; feasibility study; female; injury; male; observer variation; Ontario; problem based learning; procedures; psychometry; reproducibility; simulation training; standards; traumatology; Clinical Competence; Cross-Sectional Studies; Education, Medical, Graduate; Educational Measurement; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Internship and Residency; Male; Observer Variation; Ontario; Problem-Based Learning; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Simulation Training; Trauma Centers; Traumatology; Wounds and Injuries",2-s2.0-84995554757

Demonstrating research impact is an increasingly important aspect of academic life internationally. In this paper we argue that agendas for encouraging ‘impact’ would be well-served if impact through teaching was identified and stimulated more explicitly, and if academics better recognised and seized the opportunities that already exist for such impact. We take engagement between health geography and nurse education as an example of how social scientists could demonstrate research impact through inter-disciplinary involvement in the education of health care professionals, and specifically student nurses. We begin by showing how the UK's Research Excellence Framework (widely regarded as the key reference point for research performance management regimes internationally) has tended to produce an undervaluation of impact via education in many disciplines. A comprehensive overview of international scholarship at the intersection between geography and nursing is then presented. Here we trace three ‘waves of enquiry’ that have focused on research interactions before calling for a fourth focused on critical pedagogy. To illustrate the possibilities of this fourth wave, we sketch a case study that outlines how engagement with research around blood donation could help provide a foundation for critical pedagogy that challenges student nurses to practice reflexively, think geographically and act justly. Finally, we call for closer engagement between health geography and nurse education, by encouraging educators to translate, teach, and transfuse ideas and people between health geography and nurse education. In so doing, we argue that work at this interface can be mutually beneficial and demonstrate impact both within and beyond research assessment rubrics. Hence, our ideas are relevant beyond nurse education and geography insofar as this paper serves as an example of how reframing research impact can recover the importance of impact through education. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Geography; Interdisciplinary; Nursing; Pedagogy; Research assessment; Research impact; Students,"health care; health education; health geography; health worker; research; student; teaching; blood donor; human; human experiment; medical geography; nursing education; nursing student; pedagogics; scientist; teaching; cooperation; geographic mapping; nurse; nursing education; nursing process; patient care; research; standards; trends; United Kingdom; Cooperative Behavior; Education, Nursing, Continuing; Geographic Mapping; Humans; Nurses; Nursing Education Research; Nursing Process; Patient Care Team; Research",2-s2.0-84991660146

To address this variation, a multidisciplinary working group created a regional guideline for cALND. We explored the views and experiences of surgeons, medical oncologists (MOs), radiation oncologists (ROs) in a qualitative study that examined guideline implementation in practice. Methods The Pathman framework (awareness, agreement, adoption and adherence) informed the interview guide design and analysis. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with MOs, ROs and surgeons and transcribed. Transcripts were coded independently by 2 members of the study team and analyzed. Disagreements were resolved through consensus. Results Twenty-eight physicians (5 MO; 6RO; 17S) of 41 (68% of those approached) were interviewed. Ten of 11 (91%) hospital sites (54% community; 46% academic) and all 4 cancer clinics within the region were represented. Twenty-seven physicians (96%) were aware of the guideline, with all physicians reporting agreement and general adherence to the guideline. Most physicians indicated nodal factors, age and patient preference were key components of cALND decision-making. Physicians from all disciplines perceived that the guideline helped reduce variation in practice across the region. There were concerns that the guideline could be applied rigidly and not permit individual decision-making. Conclusions Physicians identified breast cancer as an increasingly complex and multidisciplinary issue. Facilitators to guideline implementation included perceived flexibility and buy-in from all disciplines, while individual patient factors and controversial supporting evidence may hinder its implementation. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",ACOSOG Z0011; Medical oncologist; Radiation oncologist; Semi-structured interview; Sentinel lymph node biopsy; Surgeon,adult; age; Article; awareness; axillary lymph node; breast cancer; cancer center; cancer radiotherapy; clinical practice; community hospital; consensus development; evidence based medicine; female; human; information processing; lymph node dissection; lymph node metastasis; male; mastectomy; medical decision making; medical oncologist; normal human; patient preference; physician attitude; practice guideline; priority journal; protocol compliance; qualitative research; radiation oncologist; semi structured interview; sentinel lymph node biopsy; surgeon; teaching hospital; axilla; Breast Neoplasms; health personnel attitude; lymph node; lymph node dissection; middle aged; oncology; pathology; psychology; radiation oncology; standards; surgeon; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Axilla; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Guideline Adherence; Humans; Lymph Node Excision; Lymph Nodes; Male; Medical Oncology; Middle Aged; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Qualitative Research; Radiation Oncology; Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy; Surgeons,2-s2.0-84979750780

This is particularly topical now given the widespread use of radiation in nuclear medicine and in diagnostic radiology. It is also of concern in regard to the increasing use of nuclear power as a way to cut carbon emissions. Passionate arguments are made on both sides, and there is a considerable mistrust of scientists involved in this area by the general public. Some of the reasons for the controversy and the mistrust are discussed in this chapter. Proposing that as humans we need to accept uncertainty, some approaches to develop protection frameworks, which might be more fruitful, are suggested. These include recognizing spectra of responses to a low dose rather than relying on probabilities of good or harm being caused by that dose. The shift to a response-driven rather than dose-driven framework opens up opportunities to develop personalized protection and new biological tools for assessing risk. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.

This manuscript outlines the development of a multicomponent Concurrent Disorders Program (CDP) at St Joseph's Healthcare Hamilton, with particular emphasis on a concurrent disorders inpatient unit. Methods: Prior to implementation, patient demographic and psychiatric diagnostic profiles were assessed via chart review of four acute units (95 beds) over two months. Diagnostic status, overall psychiatric impairment, and self-confidence ratings were collected in individuals with concurrent disorders who were admitted to the CDP inpatient unit from February, 2014 to September, 2015 (N=353). Results: In the four acute units, high rates of concurrent disorders (49%) and low rates of addiction treatment planning (6%) were present. Following the development of the inpatient unit, clinical data indicated heterogeneous diagnostic profiles and high levels of psychiatric severity. Following treatment, patient outcome data indicated significant decreases in overall psychiatric impairment based on staff ratings and significant increases in perceived self-confidence in resisting substance use. Conclusions: Initial patient outcomes show promise for increasing capacity and improving care for those diagnosed with concurrent disorders in an acute psychiatry context.

This article summarizes the results of my research program that evaluated Hebb's hypothesis: first, by studying infants' eye movements and initial perceptual abilities and second, by studying the effect of visual deprivation (e.g., congenital cataracts) on later perceptual development. Collectively, the results support Hebb's hypothesis that the baby does indeed learn to see. Early visual experience not only drives the baby's initial scanning of objects, but also sets up the neural architecture that will come to underlie adults' perception. ? 2016 Canadian Psychological Association.",Donald O.

We conducted face-to-face semi-structured interviews with 23 street children and two staff members from two drop-in centres in New Delhi. We asked participants to describe how they believed drop-in centres worked or did not work to influence street children's physical and mental health and substance use status. We analyzed the interviews using constant comparative method. Participants believed that because street children regularly visited drop-in centres, their health outcomes improved. Street children participated in drop-in services rather than services provided by other facilities because at the centres, the staff members were nonjudgmental, they were free to be a child, their daily struggles were lessened and they received protection. Staff at drop-in centres also provided children with moral direction and an opportunity for a better life. However, children continued to live on the streets despite what centres offered because street life had become normal to them. According to street children and staff members, drop-in centres positively influence the physical health, mental health and substance use status of street children by providing services in an environment tailored for street children. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Drop-in centres; India; New Delhi; Street child,child; clinical article; constant comparative method; human; India; male; mental health; morality; semi structured interview; staff; substance use,2-s2.0-84979894451

Concerns have been raised regarding increasing off-label use of inhaled tobramycin, particularly for the management of COPD. We conducted an 8-year repeated cross-sectional study examining the indication for prescription claims for inhaled tobramycin in Ontario paid for by the Public Drug Benefit Program, which covers all Ontario residents with financial needs or aged 65 and older. Inhaled tobramycin prescription claims increased approximately 3 times greater from 86 prescriptions in the second quarter of 2007 to 261 prescriptions in the first quarter of 2015. Approximately half of all prescriptions (range: 46-65%) per quarter were dispensed to patients with CF. A large proportion of prescriptions (range: 31-36%) were dispensed to individuals who did not have a diagnosis of CF but had a diagnosis of COPD. In 2014, there were 324 unique users of inhaled tobramycin solution in the Ontario Public Drug Program (OPDP). Only half of users (54%; n=163) had a diagnosis of CF. Our study found increasing prescriptions of inhaled tobramycin from 2007 to 2015 in the OPDP with approximately half of these claims being for off-label use, mostly among patients with COPD. ? 2016 Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

Recent findings Cardiac flow and filling pressures, on both the left and right sides of the heart, are fundamental to the accurate assessment of the HF patient. Accurate assessment of left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) systolic and diastolic function is necessary to establish, or exclude, HF as a cause or component of dyspnea in a given patient and to help determine causes of hemodynamic instability in HF patients. Variables such as spectral Doppler (mitral and tricuspid inflow, pulmonary and hepatic venous flow, and pulmonary valve regurgitation signal), tissue Doppler imaging, and speckle tracking, applied to the left and right heart, can help to accurately estimate cardiac hemodynamics.

This study was a cross-sectional retrospective cohort study of prognosis from 2001 to 2003 that quantified recent expenditures on and use of HSS by children and also by their parents. Forty-eight cases of children were selected from the Hamilton Health Sciences pediatric trauma database in the period from January 2001 to December 2003 after incurring a traumatic injury with Injury Severity Score greater than 12. The average total cost to the HSS system per child's family was $4,326.62 during the preceding 6 months. During the same period, average use of HSS was 7 visits. Total service costs incurred by caregivers of injured children increased with severity of the traumatic injury (p =.009). Caregiver HSS use was higher when the injury was caused by a motor vehicle accident than by other types of accidents (p <.001) and increased with the injury severity (p <.001). HSS use by children was related to gender (p <.001), injury mechanism (p <.001), age at accident (p <.001), and time since accident (p =.012), among other factors. Pediatric trauma appears to have long-term effects on expenditures on and use of HSS by the affected children and their families. The findings emphasize the need for long-term assessment and possible delivery of services to the families of the injured children. ? 2016 Society of Trauma Nurses.",Caregiver; Child; Cost; Family; Health care services; Pediatric; Service utilization; Social services; Traumatic injury,"adolescent; adult; analysis of variance; Canada; child; child health care; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; economics; female; health care cost; health care planning; health service; human; injury scale; long term care; male; needs assessment; Poisson distribution; preschool child; retrospective study; risk assessment; social work; statistical model; time factor; utilization; Wounds and Injuries; Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Canada; Child; Child Health Services; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Health Care Costs; Health Expenditures; Health Resources; Health Services Misuse; Humans; Injury Severity Score; Logistic Models; Long-Term Care; Male; Needs Assessment; Poisson Distribution; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Social Work; Time Factors; Wounds and Injuries",2-s2.0-84983260650

Unpaid family caregivers are primarily responsible for providing the care and support needed by persons with ADRD. In the process of caring for their loved ones with ADRD, caregivers often have to deal with multiple challenges, including their own deteriorating well-being and overall quality-of-life (QoL). A recent systematic review showed that very little research has been undertaken to study the relationship between AD caregiver QoL and the level or quality of care that caregivers provide to their loved ones. In this study, we investigate the relationships between caregiver well-being and the care provided to persons with ADRD. Methods: We used 12-month follow-up data from the Philadelphia site (n = 125) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) multi-site study, Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer's Caregiver Health (REACH I) to examine the relationship between caregiver well-being and the level or quality of care provided while adjusting for important covariates (e.g., age, income, and years since caregiving). Caregivers who participated in REACH I had to be at least 21 years of age and they had to be providing at least 4 h of care per day for 6 months or more to a live-in loved one with ADRD. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between well-being and the level or quality of care provided to persons with ADRD. Results: Of the 255 caregivers who participated in the REACH I study, 125 (49.0 %) remained after 12 months of follow-up. Comparisons of participants at the 12-month follow-up and participants who were lost to follow-up showed that these two sets of participants were not statistically significantly different on any of the variables examined in this study. Linear regression analysis showed that there was no statistically significant association between caregiver well-being and level or quality of care provided. Conclusions: Further research is required to investigate the factors associated with level and quality of care provided to persons with ADRD, and whether caregiver well-being (or QoL in general) is a contributor. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Aging; Alzheimer's disease and related disorders; Caregiving; Dementia; Level of care; Quality of care; Quality-of-life; Well-being,age; Alzheimer disease; caregiver; dementia; female; follow up; health care quality; health status; human; income; male; pathophysiology; procedures; psychology; psychometry; quality of life; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Age Factors; Alzheimer Disease; Caregivers; Dementia; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Health Status; Humans; Income; Linear Models; Male; Psychometrics; Quality of Health Care; Quality of Life,2-s2.0-84978629040

This has spurred the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) for the management of paediatric T2DM. Given the long-term complications of T2DM, optimal management is important to prevent or delay these complications. However, the quality of published CPGs has not yet been empirically evaluated. Our objective is to systematically appraise all published CPGs for the management of T2DM in children and adolescents. Methods: We will identify all published CPGs that address T2DM in children and adolescents through MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Trip, and the National Guideline Clearinghouse and will screen diabetes and paediatric societies and associations' websites. Search records will be screened in duplicate for inclusion. Grey literature will be covered by systematically searching publications of all relevant diabetes societies and associations and other health organizations for CPGs that meet our inclusion criteria. CPGs deemed eligible for inclusion will be retrieved. Quality assessment will be conducted using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool by a team of four appraisers. Scaled scores of the AGREE II will be used to gauge the overall quality of CPGs. Discussion: The results of this review will be disseminated through presentations at local, national, and international conferences and publication in a peer-reviewed journal. The results of this review can help improve the reporting of future guidelines, inform decisions of policy-makers to endorse CPGs, and affect the choice of guideline use in clinical practice.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the overall rate of MACEs in a cohort of 398 patients. Methods: All patients treated with biologics for psoriasis at 2 academic centers in Toronto, Ontario, between September 2005 and September 2014 were considered for inclusion. Medical records were reviewed to identify MACEs. Results: A total of 398 patients were included. The median duration of disease was 19.8 years. Median time to biologic therapy withdrawal because of an adverse event was 23.5 months. In this cohort, no MACEs were identified in patients treated with biologic therapy. Conclusions: Biologic treatment for psoriasis was not associated with increased cardiovascular risk in this cohort. These results require validation in larger studies. ?

R0 provides a threshold for elimination and determines when a disease can spread or when a disease will die out. Classically, R0 is calculated assuming an infinite population of identical hosts. Previous work has shown that heterogeneity in the host mixing rate increases R0 in an infinite population. However, it has been suggested that in a finite population, heterogeneity in the mixing rate may actually decrease the finite-population reproductive numbers. Here, we outline a framework for discussing different types of heterogeneity in disease parameters, and how these affect disease spread and control. We calculate ""finite-population reproductive numbers"" with different types of heterogeneity, and show that in a finite population, heterogeneity has complicated effects on the reproductive number. We find that simple heterogeneity decreases the finite-population reproductive number, whereas heterogeneity in the intrinsic mixing rate (which affects both infectiousness and susceptibility) increases the finite-population reproductive number when R0 is small relative to the size of the population and decreases the finite-population reproductive number when R0 is large relative to the size of the population. Although heterogeneity has complicated effects on the finite-population reproductive numbers, its implications for control are straightforward: when R0 is large relative to the size of the population, heterogeneity decreases the finite-population reproductive numbers, making disease control or elimination easier than predicted by R0. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Basic reproductive number; Heterogeneity; Super-spreaders,"Article; basic reproduction number; controlled study; disease elimination; finite element analysis; human; mathematical computing; mathematical model; population density; population reproductive number; population size; priority journal; algorithm; biological model; disease eradication; Disease Outbreaks; disease predisposition; epidemiology; population density; population dynamics; procedures; statistics and numerical data; Algorithms; Disease Eradication; Disease Outbreaks; Disease Susceptibility; Humans; Models, Biological; Population Density; Population Dynamics",2-s2.0-84959310264

In the lower leg, values from load cells are compared to injury criteria developed in cadaveric studies. These criteria are typically developed with the leg in a neutral posture, whereas the ATD may assume a wide range of postures during safety evaluation tests. The degree to which the initial posture of an ATD has an effect on the measured forces and moments in the lower leg is unknown. Methods: A Hybrid III ATD lower leg was impacted in a range of postures under conditions representing a crash test, and peak axial force and adjusted tibia index injury measures were evaluated. Ankle posture was varied in 5° increments using a custom-made footplate, and dorsi/plantarflexion (20° DF to 20° PF) and in/eversion (20° IV to 5° EV) were evaluated. Tibia angle was also varied (representing knee flexion/extension) by ±10° from neutral. Results: Peak axial force was not affected by ankle flexion or tibia angulation. Adjusted tibia index was lowest for plantarflexion, as well as for tibia angles representative of knee extension. Both peak axial force and adjusted tibia index were lowest for postures of great inversion and were highest in neutral or near-neutral postures. Conclusions: The range of postures tested herein spanned published injury criteria and thus would have made the difference between pass and fail in a safety evaluation. In/eversion had the largest influence on injury metrics, likely due to the change in axial stiffness and altered impact durations in these postures. Results suggest increased injury risk at neutral or near-neutral postures, whereas previous cadaveric studies have suggested that in/eversion does not influence injury risk. It is unclear whether the ATD appropriately represents the natural lower leg for impacts in out-of-position testing. Great care must be taken when initially positioning ATDs for safety evaluations, because small perturbations in posture were shown herein to have large effects on the measured injury risk using this tool. ? 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",anthropomorphic test device; impact; lower leg; posture; surrogate; tibia index,"ankle; biomechanics; body position; human; joint characteristics and functions; leg; Leg Injuries; manikin; physiology; statistics and numerical data; tibia; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Ankle; Biomechanical Phenomena; Humans; Leg; Leg Injuries; Manikins; Posture; Range of Motion, Articular; Tibia",2-s2.0-84962852751

The discussion analyzes and critiques the underlying assumptions necessary to believe that PHD is good. The role of worldviews in the deliberation of any moral question and the importance of recognizing personal bias are highlighted. The authors present common issues regarding PHD, including suffering, parental autonomy and future quality of life, and examine the basic assumptions on which these arguments are made. Finally, they conclude that the assumptions required are incorrect and that PHD should not be allowed in the case of children.

Collaborative cancer conferences (cccs) are modified mccs that might overcome such barriers. Methods We established a ccc at an academic tertiary care centre to review preoperative plans for patients with rectal cancer. Attendees included only surgeons who perform colorectal cancer procedures and a radiologist with expertise in cross-sectional imaging. Individual reviews began with the primary surgeon presenting the case information and initial treatment recommendations. Cross-sectional images were then reviewed, the case was discussed, and consensus on ccc-treatment recommendations was achieved. Outcomes for the present study were changes in treatment recommendations defined as “major” (that is, redirection of patient to preoperative radiation from straight-to-surgery or uncertain plan, or redirection of the patient to straight-to-surgery from preoperative radiation or plan uncertain) or as “minor” (that is, referral to a multidisciplinary cancer clinic, request additional tests, change type of neoadjuvant therapy, change type of surgery). Chart reviews provided relevant patient, tumour, and treatment information. Results Between September 2011 and September 2012, 101 rectal cancer patients were discussed at a ccc. Of the 35 management plans (34.7%) that were changed as a result, 8 had major changes, and 27 had minor changes. Available patient and tumour factors did not predict for a change in treatment recommendation. Conclusions Preoperative cccs at a tertiary-care centre changed treatment recommendations for one third of patients with rectal cancer. Given that no specific factor predicted for a treatment plan change, it is likely prudent that all rectal cancer patients undergo some form of collaborative review. ? 2016 Multimed Inc.",Colorectal or anal neoplasia,adult; aged; Article; cancer staging; cancer surgery; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outcome assessment; rectum cancer; tertiary care center,2-s2.0-84963877010

Our hypothesis was that there is an increased prevalence and clinical relevance of positive abdominal/pelvic CT findings in senior patients. A research ethics board-approved retrospective review of all adult patients who underwent an emergency CT of the abdomen and pelvis for acute nontraumatic abdominal and/or pelvic signs and symptoms was performed. Two thousand one hundred two patients between October 1, 2011, and September 30, 2013, were reviewed. Six hundred thirty-one patients were included in the <65 group (298 men and 333 women; mean age 46, age range 18–64), and 462 were included in the >65 group (209 men and 253 women; mean age 77.6, age range 65–99). Overall, there were more positive CT findings for patients <65 (389 positive cases, 61.6?%) compared with the >65 group (257 positive cases, 55.6?%), which was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.03). Moreover, with the exception of complicated appendicitis cases, which were more common in the >65 group, there were no statistically significant differences in the clinical/surgical relevance of the positive CT findings between the two groups. The findings of our retrospective study therefore refute our hypothesis that there is an increased prevalence of positive abdominal CT findings in patients >65. This may be related to ED physicians at our institution being more hesitant to order CT examinations for the younger population, presumably due to radiation concerns. However, older patients in our series were more likely to present with complicated appendicitis, and a lower threshold for ordering CT examinations of the abdomen and pelvis in this patient population should therefore be considered. ? 2015, American Society of Emergency Radiology.",Abdominal and pelvic pain; Computed tomography; Emergency medicine; Geriatrics,"abdomen; abscess; acute appendicitis; adult; aged; appendicitis; Article; colitis; computer assisted tomography; diverticulitis; emergency ward; enteritis; female; gynecologic disease; human; intestine ischemia; intestine obstruction; intestine perforation; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; pancreatitis; pathology; pelvis; perforation; prevalence; priority journal; research ethics; retrospective study; tertiary care center; urogenital tract disease; very elderly; abdominal radiography; adolescent; adverse effects; comparative study; diagnostic imaging; emergency; hospital emergency service; pelvis; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Emergencies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pelvis; Prevalence; Radiography, Abdominal; Retrospective Studies; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84948172548

Thrombus has the potential to embolize to the microvasculature limiting effective coronary blood flow. Thrombus burden is associated with a higher mortality and manual aspiration thrombectomy has the potential to reduce thrombus burden. The first large trial of routine aspiration thrombectomy (TAPAS, N = 1071) showed an improvement in myocardial blush and an unexpected reduction in mortality. Reinforcing the enthusiasm for this finding meta-analysis of small trials also showed a reduction in mortality, which led to routine manual thrombectomy becoming a class IIa recommendation in the American and European Guidelines for STEMI. Subsequently; however, large trials such as TOTAL (N = 10,732) and TASTE (N = 7244) and meta-analysis showed an increase in the risk of stroke with routine manual thrombectomy but no improvement in mortality, myocardial infarction, stent thrombosis, or severe heart failure. As such, manual thrombectomy should not be routinely used instead saving it as a bailout procedure as indicated. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Outcomes; Percutaneous coronary intervention; ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction; STEMI; Thrombectomy,cerebrovascular accident; clinical effectiveness; disease severity; heart failure; human; meta analysis (topic); mortality; multicenter study (topic); percutaneous coronary intervention; practice guideline; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; risk assessment; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; stent thrombosis; thrombus; thrombus aspiration; treatment outcome; adverse effects; evidence based medicine; Myocardial Infarction; percutaneous coronary intervention; procedures; Stroke; thrombectomy; Evidence-Based Medicine; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Stroke; Thrombectomy,2-s2.0-84975700651

We tested a prototype neonatal offset-blade laryngoscope (NOBL) developed to overcome these limitations. Our aims were to compare the pressure on the upper jaw exerted by a size 0 Miller laryngoscope and the NOBL on a neonatal manikin, as well as the time taken to intubate the trachea and the area of view of the larynx. Twenty healthcare professionals with more than five years of experience in neonatal intensive care took part; the findings were assessed using pressure-sensitive film and photographs. High-pressure indentation occurred in 17 (85%) attempts using the Miller versus 1 (5%) using the NOBL (p = 0.0001). The median (IQR [range]) pressure exerted with the Miller laryngoscope was 455 (350-526 [75-650]) kPa vs 80 (0-133 [0-195]) kPa with the NOBL (p &lt; 0.0001). The area of pressure exerted with the Miller laryngoscope was 68 (32-82 [0-110]) mm2 vs 8 (0-23 [0-40]) mm2 with the NOBL (p &lt; 0.0001). The time to intubate was 8.3 (7.3-10.1[4-19]) s for the Miller and 8.0 (5.6-9.6 [4-13.5]) s for the NOBL (p &lt; 0.0001). The area of view blocked by the Miller laryngoscope was 38% of the oral orifice versus 12% with the NOBL.

This study (1) described EPCs in pre- and late-pubertal males and females, (2) examined their association with fitness, activity and adiposity, and (3) compared EPCs to published cell definitions. 94 participants completed 2 sessions. During the first session, aerobic fitness (Wpeak) and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were assessed. During the second session, percent body fat (%BF) was determined by DXA, and a fasted blood sample was collected to measure EPCs by flow cytometry. EPCs were identified as CD31+CD34brightCD45dimCD133+. Samples were reanalyzed and cell counts were compared to 8 previously published EPC definitions.

Many countries have established national public cord blood banks; such banks often coexist with a panoply of private options for cord blood banking. Until recently, Canada was the only G8 country without a national cord blood bank. This differs markedly from the United States, which years ago established a national cord blood bank policy and inventory. This article investigates potential reasons for this discrepancy through a comparative analysis of the evolution of programs and policies on national cord blood banking in Canada and the United States. My analysis suggests that cross-national discrepancies in policy on public cord blood banking were determined primarily by institutional factors, principal among them formal governmental structure and the legacy of past policies. Institutional entrepreneurialism in the health sector played a constitutive role in the earlier evolution of national cord blood policy in the United States as compared to Canada. ? 2016 by Duke University Press.",Cord blood banking; Historical institutionalism; Institutional entrepreneurship; Public policy,blood bank; Canada; comparative study; entrepreneurship; fetus blood; human; organization and management; policy; politics; private sector; public sector; United States; Blood Banks; Canada; Entrepreneurship; Fetal Blood; Humans; Policy; Politics; Private Sector; Public Sector; United States,2-s2.0-84963825559

Methods We retrospectively analyzed data from Danish registries on patients with a first-time recorded AF from 2005 to 2010. We simulated the adoption of a decisional model based on the individual absolute risk reduction of stroke and absolute risk increase of bleeding with warfarin, as expected from the patient CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED, adjusted for a 0.6 relative value for bleeding versus stroke. We studied 3 different model versions and calculated for each of them the net benefit associated with its adoption, measured as the value-adjusted reduction in stroke and bleeding events at 1 year, compared with i) the actual practice, or ii) recommending warfarin consistently with the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, irrespective of HAS-BLED. Results We included 41,455 patients; 31.9% actually received warfarin. The expected treatment rate with the model ranged from 21% to 87% according to the version used. The model version resulting into the highest treatment rate (i.e. treating any patient with CHA2DS2-VASc ? 1) was associated with the greatest net benefit (0.98; 95% credible interval 0.72-1.23), compared with the actual practice, with a 1/3 reduction in overall mortality, as with the adoption of ESC guidelines. Conclusions Preliminarily to a randomized impact study, our analysis suggests that individualizing anticoagulation for AF using a decisional model might have a clinical advantage over actual practice, and no added advantage over following ESC guidelines. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The purpose was to summarize the evidence for dosing, frequency, definition of tolerance, and dose conversions between opioids in cancer patients administered various fentanyl ROO preparations. A literature search was conducted and 16 studies identified. Each definition varied but the majority classified BTP as a transient flare. The lowest OTFC starting dose of 200 mcg was used in all but two studies, 100 mcg for both sublingual and buccal preparations and 50mg for intranasal fentanyl. Six of the nine OTFC studies as well as the intranasal study also noted that patients should not receive more than four doses in a 24-hour period. The maximum number of doses of sublingual per day varied in each study. The most common symptoms regardless of the formulation were nausea, vomiting and constipation. BTP is a severe transitory pain that is sudden in onset and has a short duration. Many forms of fentanyl have been utilized in management of BTP. An entry dose of 60 mg of oral morphine was required in a majority of the studies and adverse events were as expected in patients medicated with opioids. The majority of patients required more than the minimum dose. Beginning treatment with larger doses would reduce the time to onset of pain relief. Future studies should investigate using larger doses in the prospective setting. ? 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-85060294731

Perinatal mood and anxiety disorders are not culturally bound: they affect women in every society and from every socioeconomic background. The aim of this chapter is to increase awareness among healthcare providers about mood- and anxiety-related disorders in pregnancy and postpartum (the “perinatal” period). To achieve this goal, the chapter provides key information about the presentation of these disorders in the perinatal period, along with research about biological and psychosocial risk factors for illness. Clinical presentations Most psychiatric disorders can occur in the perinatal period, but mood and anxiety disorders are particularly common among women of reproductive age. Pregnancy is not protective against the development or recurrence of these disorders, and evidence suggests that the postpartum period is a time of increased risk for new-onset mood and anxiety problems. In particular, there is a risk of mood-related psychosis in the postpartum period, with women suffering from bipolar disorder at high risk. Further, there is a high risk of comorbidity with mood and anxiety disorders co-occurring (Grigoriadis, et al. 2011). In the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders (DSM-5) mood and anxiety disorders are classified into five separate categories: Depressive disorders, Bipolar and related disorders, Anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder and social anxiety disorder), Obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, and Trauma and Stressor-related disorders (including adjustment disorder, acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]) (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Mood and anxiety disorders occurring in pregnancy or postpartum are not classified as distinct disorders in the DSM-5. However, due to the distinct risks related to perinatal mood disorders, episodes of depressive and bipolar disorders occurring during this time are classified with the use of the specifier: “with peripartum onset.” Specifically, the DSM-5 specifier indicates that “peripartum-onset” pertains only to episodes occurring in pregnancy or with onset in the first four weeks after delivery, although research suggests that risk is likely elevated throughout the first postpartum year. ?

Catheter-induced coronary spasm has been occasionally demonstrated, but its relationship to spontaneous coronary spasm is unclear. We describe a 64-year-old female who underwent coronary artery bypass surgery in 1998 on the basis of an angiographic diagnosis of severe left main disease, who recently presented with increasingly frequent typical angina. Repeat coronary angiography was immediately complicated by severe chest pain, hypotension, and bradycardia but demonstrated only mild disease of the left main artery and entire coronary tree with complete occlusion of her prior grafts. This reaction was almost identical to that observed during her original coronary angiogram. We now believe her original angiogram was complicated by severe catheter-induced left main spasm, with the accompanying contrast reaction attributed to left main disease, and the occlusion of coronary grafts explained by the absence of significant left main disease. The combination of these symptoms has not been documented in the literature. In this instance, these manifestations erroneously led to coronary bypass surgery. It is unknown whether routine, systematic injection of intracoronary nitroglycerin prior to angiography might blunt the severity of such reactions.

Clinically, MRI takes advantage of the spin properties of hydrogen (1H) nuclei due to the high concentration and relative abundance in tissue water and fats. However, other nuclei having the quantum mechanical property of spin can also be probed. One of the most common is phosphorous (31P), which has 100% natural abundance and reasonable in vivo concentrations that are measurable at clinical MRI field strengths. Phosphorous measurements can provide an understanding of important metabolic pathways within tissues, which ultimately can help in better understanding disease and treatment. However, clinical MRIs do not routinely come with the ability to assess non-1H nuclei. Hence, hardware and pulse sequences need development, while considering the need to easily interface with standard clinical MRI hardware and protocols. This review describes the motivation for and development of MRI RF hardware designs for a human breast imaging system that can acquire31P data from a clinically approved breast MR imaging and biopsy table. ? 2016 by Begell House, Inc.",Dual tuned; Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS); RF coil,Biomechanics; Hardware; Magnetic fields; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Magnetism; Medical imaging; Phosphorus; Quantum theory; Resonance; Tissue; Design and construction; Dual tuned; Magnetic field gradient; Magnetic resonance spectroscopies (MRS); Non-invasive imaging; Relative abundance; RF coil; Strong magnetic fields; Magnetic resonance imaging; Article; breast; electromagnetic radiation; in vivo study; magnetic field; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantum mechanics; radiofrequency; theoretical model; tissue metabolism,2-s2.0-85041855610

Diagnosis is currently confirmed at autopsy, although CTE’s presumed sufferers have symptoms of depression, suicidal thoughts, mood and personality changes, and loss of memory. CTE sufferers also complain of losing cognitive ability, dysfunction in everyday activities, inability to keep regular employment, violent tendencies and marital strife. Dementia may develop over the long term. Unfortunately, there is no clear consensus in regards to pathology, with both number and severity of head injuries being linked to disease progression. Despite the slow advancement of this disease, there are no clinical methods to diagnose or monitor prognosis in presumed patients, limiting clinicians’ efforts to symptom management. The lack of diagnostic tools fuels the need for biomedical engineers to develop techniques for in vivo detection of CTE.

The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to examine registered nurses' (RNs) perspectives of the strengths, gaps, barriers and opportunities for optimizing nursing roles in the delivery of CSC within PC settings. Participants completed a demographical questionnaire and semi-structured, in-depth telephone interview. Data collection and analysis were conducted concurrently. Data were analyzed using content analysis approaches. The sample included 18 RNs working in diverse PC settings across Ontario. Participants' involvement in CSC was limited, but it could be categorized into the following three themes: care coordination and system navigation, emotional support and facilitating access to community resources. Individual, practice setting and PC team factors influenced nurses' involvement in CSC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Canadian study to examine RN roles in PC settings related to CSC. There is wide variability and opportunity to enhance RNs' roles and involvement in CSC.",,human; neoplasm; nurse attitude; nursing; oncology nursing; Ontario; organization and management; patient care; primary health care; survival rate; survivor; Continuity of Patient Care; Humans; Neoplasms; Nurse's Role; Oncology Nursing; Ontario; Primary Health Care; Survival Rate; Survivors,2-s2.0-85032145520

Therefore, the detection and measurement of NO in a physiological fluid, either in gas or in liquid phase, are scientifically and clinically significant. The objective of this research is to develop a single-use, disposable cost effective in vitro NO biosensor which can measure NO of ppb (parts per billion) level in gas phase and sub-μM (sub micro mole) level in liquid phase. This biosensor is a thin film platinum based electrochemical sensor. Ni (II) tetrakis (3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenlyl) porphyrin is mixed with diethylene glycol and Nafion forming a NO selective membrane-electrolyte. Reactive sputtering, laser ablation, thick film printing technologies are used to fabricate the biosensor on a roll-to-roll cost effective processing. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) is employed as the measurement technique. The results of this NO biosensor show that this biosensor can measure NO down to 5ppb in gas phase and 0.00242 μM of NO in PBS solution (liquid phase). Fabrication and test procedures of this NO biosensor are described in this presentation.

Since David Harvey’s influential characterization of globalization as “time-space compression”, ample research has looked at the spatial aspect of the phenomenon, yet few have focused on globalization’s temporal aspects. Meanwhile, other publications have analysed problems of speed, acceleration, and the commodification of time, but while it often serves as the implicit or explicit backdrop for these studies of time, globalization is not investigated as a problem or a question in its own right. In response, this volume develops these conversations to consider how time shapes globalization, and how globalization affects our experience of time. The interplay between varying aspects of the human experiences of time and globalization requires the type of interdisciplinary approach that this volume takes. The contributors advance an understanding of global time(s) as an arena of contestation, with social, political, ecological, and cultural implications for human and other lives. In considering the diverse valences of time and globalization, they illuminate problems as well as possibilities. Topics covered include emerging infectious diseases, temporal sovereignty, worker exploitation and resistance, chronobiology, energy politics, activism and hope, and literary and cinematic representations of counter-temporalities, offering a rich and varied account of global times. This volume will be of great interest to students and researchers from a range of disciplines, including anthropology, cultural studies, globalization, international relations, literary studies, political science, social theory, and sociology. ? 2017 selection and editorial material, Paul Huebener, Susie O’Brien, Tony Porter, Liam Stockdale and Yanqiu Rachel Zhou.",,,2-s2.0-85020768248

This article reviews basic aspects of KT, its differences with translational research, the conceptual framework on which the KT is supported, its scope and objectives, the tools used for the translation, the possible barriers and interventions to counteract them. Clinical practice guidelines, which are based on systematic reviews of the literature, are the ideal tools to synthesize, analyze and contextualize the evidence with the aim to create recommendations, which are the first step when we are interested in planning a KT intervention to be implemented in a target audience. ? 2016, Universidad de Antioquia.

It is caused by parasites of the genus Plasmodium, which have a complex life cycle including insect vectors that are in the case of human malaria exclusively Anopheles mosquitoes. To date the genomes of several Plasmodium species have been sequenced. The overall genome organization is rather conserved, but highly divers species-specific gene families have been identified as well. The different life cycle stages exhibit a very variable morphology reflecting their respective needs. The change in cell shape during development is genetically inherited, but epigenetic factors also appear to play an important role. In the vertebrate host cell invasion and egress are crucial steps for the survival of the parasite and have evolved to highly orchestrated events, and some molecular details have been deciphered to date. Invasion occurs by invagination of the host cell membrane, and the parasite finally resides in a parasitophorous vacuole. From there it controls the behavior of its host cell by secretion of proteins into the host cell cytoplasm and to its surface. Exposed parasite proteins at the surface of an infected red blood cell allow cytoadherence and are responsible for the pathogenicity of a Plasmodium infection. Egress is a two-step process initiated by the rupture of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane and followed by disintegration of the host cell membrane that involves the activation of proteases, kinases, and membrane lytic enzymes. Recent discoveries revealed completely new parasite strategies to switch from asexual to sexual development during the blood stage and to avoid elimination by cytosolic immune responses of host cells during infection of hepatocytes. ?

Our outpatient palliative care oncology clinic has experienced an increase in interest from patients to incorporate medical cannabis into their symptom management. The aim of this study is to better understand the demographics, diagnosis, and symptom profile of patients with advanced cancer accessing medical cannabis. Methods: A retrospective chart review was undertaken of patients accessing medical cannabis at an academic tertiary Symptom Management Clinic for a seven month study period in 2014. Results: Of approximately 340 patients seen in clinic, 43 patients (12.5%) were identified as having obtained authorization for medical cannabis. Patients were predominantly older with 74.4% of patients aged 51-75 years, and 4.7% of patients were over 75 years of age. They had a wide variety of cancer diagnosis, of which GI maligancies (30%) and lung cancer (20.9%) were the most common. Patients experienced a multitude of symptoms with pain being the most common (88.4%), followed by fatigue, nausea and lack of appetite. Of note, a significant number (39.5%) reported already using medical cannabsi at the time of lisencing. Conclusions: The field of medical cannabis use is young and much work still needs to be done to understand its place amongst symptom management in general and in palliative patients specifically. This small retrospective study describes a cohort of pallaitive cancer patients who accessed medical cannabis to manage a variety of symptoms. ?

Methods: Researchers and HTA experts who responded to an email invitation participated in a telephone interview. We used qualitative content analysis to analyze the anonymized transcripts. We conducted a comprehensive literature search for studies that used PROs to investigate burden of disease or to assess the impact of interventions across the five LSDs of interest. Results: Interviews with seven researchers and six HTA experts representing eight countries revealed five themes. These were: (i) the importance of using psychometrically sound PROs in studies with rare diseases, (ii) the paucity of disease-specific PROs, (iii) the importance of having PRO data for economic analyses, (iv) practical and psychometric limitations of existing PROs, and (v) suggestions for new PROs.

The recommendations concerning fever definition are supported mainly by other existing guidelines. No evidence was found that directly pertained to the assessment of fever before a diagnosis of febrile neutropenia was made. However, some studies evaluated approaches to symptom management that included fever among the symptoms. Few studies directly addressed information needs and resources for managing fever in cancer patients. Conclusions Fever in patients with cancer who are receiving systemic therapy is a common and potentially serious symptom that requires prompt assessment, but currently, evidence to inform best practices concerning when, where, and by whom that assessment is done is very limited. ? 2016 Multimed Inc.",Chemotherapy; Febrile neutropenia; Fever,Article; body temperature; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; evidence based medicine; febrile neutropenia; fever; human; patient education; peer review; practice guideline; prediction; questionnaire,2-s2.0-84982938701

We aimed to identify barriers to pre-hospital oral analgesia administration to adult patients, as perceived by paramedics, using qualitative methods. Methods Paramedics from a county emergency medical service were invited to participate in semi-structured interviews. The interviews consisted of two questions regarding barriers to pre-hospital administration of oral analgesia using a previously established medical directive. The same investigator completed all interviews, which were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Barriers to analgesia administration to adult patients were identified from the interview transcripts using open coding of the data. Two investigators completed the coding process independently and discrepancies were then resolved by consensus. Code frequencies were tabulated and thematic analysis was used to organise the data into broad domains and themes. Results In total, 44 paramedics of a possible 46 (95.7%) completed a semi-structured interview. The final sample size was 43 after exclusion criteria were applied. The median paramedic age and practice experience was 39 and 9.5 years respectively, and 58% of the participants were male. Barriers to oral analgesia administration emerged in the domains of patient, medical directive, and paramedic factors. Conclusion Paramedic perceived barriers to pre-hospital oral analgesia administration were identified and include those related to patient, medical directive, and paramedic factors. Minimising these barriers should be undertaken to reduce rates of pre-hospital undertreatment of pain and improve pre-hospital pain management. ? 2016, Paramedics Australasia.

To properly understand these oncodynamic processes-how the bone changes in response to cancer cell invasion-it is necessary to define the types of cells that are present in normal bone, to explore the main physiological functions of these cells and of the bone itself, and to describe the types of cancers that often grow in bone. To properly characterize the functional and anatomical responses of bone cells, a broader definition of what cell types are present in bone is required. Using a more comprehensive and inclusive definition of bone cells, adaptations that result from cancer cell invasion can be categorized on the basis of the signalled functional and structural changes that occur between all involved cells in the bone environment. These pathological responses will be integrated with what is known about the chemical mediators that may be involved. This analysis of the normal signalling environment in bone and the potential interactions between cell types will help to better characterize the complex oncodynamic processes that can occur when cancer invades bone and disrupts this carefully balanced microenvironment. ?

It is debilitating and has a significant impact on one’s physical, mental and social wellbeing. Currently, the ambiguities surrounding CRF have made the standardization of diagnostic and treatment methods difficult. Although there is limited literature on CRF, several hypotheses have been proposed with regard to its underlying mechanisms. These hypotheses include serotonin dysregulation, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis dysfunction, afferent nerve activation, the basal ganglia hypothesis and muscle wasting. One of the most promising hypotheses is muscle wasting, involving both the degradation of muscle and the inhibition of muscle regeneration. These pathways are initiated through tumour-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Following the activation of nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B-cells (NF-κB), its downstream effects further the progression of muscle wasting. This leads to a more aggravated state known as cachexia. As CRF is multifaceted, further research into the various hypotheses discussed in this chapter would greatly benefit cancer patients experiencing fatigue. ?

Cancer pain, like the disease itself, is widely diverse in its quality and extent, and can result from many different causative factors. Many factors have been implicated in the causation and maintenance of cancer pain. Neuropathic pain results from damaged peripheral or central neuronal tissue and from chronically altered neuronal signalling resulting from central and peripheral sensitization. Neuronal tissue can be damaged by direct invasion by tumour cells, as is the case of tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) or by invasion of peripheral neurons in peripheral host tissues. Cancer cells and associated cells also secrete a large number of chemical factors, some of which can directly damage or simulate neurons. Direct physical interaction between the tumour mass and the altered host tissues with neuronal tissue can also cause neuropathic damage through nerve disruption and destruction. Cancer cells and associated cells including stromal and immune cells also secrete a host of chemical signalling molecules that can directly and indirectly stimulate nociceptors. Thermal stimuli of sensory neurons can become pathological following peripheral and central sensitization, which decreases the threshold temperature at which thermally sensitive neurons will respond. Pain is also often a side effect of many treatments of cancer, although the mechanisms of these treatment-induced conditions are beyond the scope of this review. Treatment of cancer pain itself largely relies on analgesics and therapies directed against the cancers themselves, although specific treatments for cancer pain are more recently becoming available. It is often the case, however, that cancer pain conditions become intractable, or are poorly controlled. Breakthrough pain which is prevalent in cancer pain is defined by its relationship to treatment where it is an episodic painful event that occurs during a routine of normally effective pain control. Cancer pain is a serious and prevalent oncodynamic effect that arises from a highly variable array of stimuli. The study of cancer pain as a distinct phenomenon is still in its infancy. ?

In cancer patients, the prevalence of depression is dramatically increased. In addition to the psychosocial impact of a negative diagnosis, recent evidence suggests that cancer-induced depression (CID) is mediated by biological processes. This oncodynamic effect of cancer on the development of depression is poorly understood, leading to ineffective treatment of CID with drugs that are developed for depressive disorders in the general population. This chapter begins by outlining the clinical profile of major depressive disorder (MDD). We then provide a discussion of the most prominent neurobiological hypotheses of depression, including the monoamine hypothesis, the role of neurotrophins, physiological stress, inflammation, and glutamatergic signalling. The efficacy of current antidepressants is then discussed for depression in the general population and in cancer patients. This leads to a discussion of the biological basis of CID, including the effects of physiological stress, inflammation, and glutamatergic signalling. We conclude that more research is needed to determine oncodynamic events in the development of CID. Development of validated animal models is the first step in delineating contributing biological mechanisms, which will ultimately lead to more targeted drug development and improved efficacy. ?

We begin with a brief review of conventional accounts of neurogenesis and progress toward current issues in the field. Finally, we discuss the potential influence of cancer on the formation and innervation of new neural networks, and the effects of this on metastatic tumour progression. The process of neurogenesis was traditionally believed to occur exclusively during embryonic stages, but recent evidence strongly suggests that neurogenesis occurs in discrete regions of the adult mammalian central nervous system (CNS), and that this process may be upregulated in the presence of cancer. A complex network of biochemical pathways and signalling molecules influence metastatic tumour growth. The dysregulation of these signalling pathways by cancer drives tumour growth and leads to significant symptoms, including pain. Tumour cells secrete growth factors, cytokines, and chemokines and are reported to stimulate adjacent nociceptors. Progressive tumour growth is accompanied by escalating pain behaviours in murine models of cancer-induced bone pain. Neurotrophic factors play an important role in the functionality of nociceptive afferents, and represent a probable link between metastatic tumour growth and pain. ?

However, while these changes may initiate the process of cancer development, they are not necessarily sufficient for disease progression, given the body’s intrinsic ability to regain homeostasis. Cancer initiation, promotion, and eventual progression depend on disruptions in normal homeostasis, as well as subsidiary processes imparted by cells of the tumour microenvironment. Recurring players that have been linked with disrupted homeostasis include inflammation and oxidative stress, which have both been strongly associated with the development of cancer. This chapter discusses the intricate relationship between the body and cancer, and how disruptions in normal physiological processes impact the maintenance of homeostasis and tissue repair, providing a framework for understanding the connection between dysregulated homeostatis and a complex disease such as cancer. ?

Aside from medical interventions and therapies associated with treating the disease, the cancer itself is a major contributor to systemic disruption of physiological processes. Extracellular body fluid is tightly controlled and monitored by a variety of sensors, hormones, proteins, and organs. Palpable changes in fluid homeostasis can commonly be attributed to inflammation, where the changes in vasculature necessary to facilitate an immune response compromise the vascular endothelial barrier. Such changes, although transient, reveal the consequences of compromised vessel walls, leakage of plasma proteins, and collection of fluid in the interstitial space. Edema represents a pathological form of fluid extravasation into the interstitium and is a common clinical feature in many cases of malignancy. By examining common inflammatory factors secreted by the tumour, it becomes evident that the increased levels of such factors in patient sera could, indeed, influence a pro-edematous state. Therefore, it is the dynamics of the tumour itself in isolation of therapeutic side effects that can influence local and systemic vasculature by promoting a chronic inflammatory state characterized by leaky vasculature and dysregulated fluid homeostasis. ?

OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of implementing a VBS investigation, parent apprisal template and Visible Blood in the Stool - Assessment Tool (VBS-AT) on standardized reporting and the evaluation of clinical improvement. METHODS:Aprospective quality improvement cohort studywas conducted in a tertiary, neonatal unit. All infants with isolated VBS without clinical signs, radiological pneumatosis and abnormal laboratory results were included. The template and VBS-AT instrument were implemented at the bedside. Criteria for discontinuation of contact precautions and readiness for discharge home were defined apriori. RESULTS: Eight infants developed VBS during the cluster lasting ten days. Seventy-four (78%) of the 98 episodes were graded by the VBS-AT. Five of the six infants had a maximum VBS grade of 3. The duration of VBS and contact precautions ranged from 4-38 days. All six infants with a VBS grade ?2 for 4 consecutive days did not deteriorate beyond grade ?3 or develop gastrointestinal complications during the ten week period following the end of the cluster. Consistent objective reporting of the severity of VBS and consistent evaluation of infants' progress over time contained the cluster effectively and facilitated discharge of stable infants. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a tool to standardize, investigate and objectively monitor the severity of VBS is feasible and improves effectiveness of care at no extra cost. ? 2015 - IOS Press and the authors.",neonates; quality improvement; stool; Visible blood,"Article; assessment of humans; clinical article; clinical evaluation; clinical trial; cohort analysis; disease severity; female; health care planning; home; hospital discharge; human; infant; infection control; male; newborn; newborn disease; priority journal; prospective study; rectum hemorrhage; standardization; total quality management; visible blood in the stool; visible blood the stool assessment tool; cluster analysis; decision support system; documentation; feces; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; neonatal intensive care unit; patient isolation; rectum; severity of illness index; standards; Cluster Analysis; Decision Support Techniques; Documentation; Feces; Female; Gastrointestinal Hemorrhage; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Male; Patient Discharge; Patient Isolation; Prospective Studies; Quality Improvement; Rectum; Severity of Illness Index",2-s2.0-84955058055

Abdominal CT scans were obtained at the discretion of physicians in the ED. Clinician suspicion for IAIs was considered positive if the risk of this outcome was presumed to be =1%. Likewise, the patients were considered to be non-low risk for the clinical prediction instrument if any one of the seven variables in the instrument was present. Patients assigned a clinical suspicion of <1% or deemed low risk by the clinical prediction instrument were considered to be at very low risk for IAI requiring acute intervention (equivalent to a 0.1% risk of IAI in the derivation study). IAIs requiring acute intervention were defined as follows: death due to abdominal injury, surgical intervention, angiographic embolization due to bleeding, blood transfusion for anemia secondary to traumatic hemorrhage, or requiring intravenous fluids for two or more nights in patients with gastrointestinal injuries. The authors calculated and compared the test characteristics for both the prediction instrument and clinical suspicion (=1%) for predicting patients with a significant IAI requiring acute intervention. ? 2015 by the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine.",,Article; blunt trauma; childhood injury; computer assisted tomography; human; prediction; priority journal; procedures; quality control; trunk,2-s2.0-84954400474

Purpose: To explore the role of S-phase kinaseinteracting protein 2 (Skp2), cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27, and the transcription factor E2F-1 expression in the development of GCTB, and the relationship of expression of these proteins with tumor recurrence. Methods: Forty-four patients with GCTB were selected and demographic and clinical data were collected. The levels of Skp2, p27, and E2F-1 protein expression were immunohistochemically assessed in surgical specimens. Results: Skp2, p27, and E2F-1 proteins were detected in the nuclei of mononuclear stromal cells. Positive Skp2 expression was observed in 66% (29/44) of GCTB patient samples, and positive p27 expression was found in 39% (17/44) of samples. Within almost all GCTB patients, there was an inverse correlation between Skp2- and p27-positive tumor cells. Positive expression of E2F-1 was present in 28 of 44 (64%) patients. In addition, expression of skp2 and p27, infiltration of soft tissues, and surgical operation were significantly associated with recurrence in patients with GCTB. Conclusion: The immunohistochemical assessment of Skp2, p27 and E2F-1 may be useful in the diagnosis of GCTB and prediction of its prognosis. ? 2015, International Journal of Clinical and Experimental Medicine.

A problem-based learning approach was used to study the biological issues, whereas the cultural transmutations of these molecular mechanisms were explored using a variety of resources (novels, cookbooks, and films). Multiple evaluation procedures were used: problem summaries and problem-solving exercises (tripartite problem-solving exercise) for the problem-based learning component and group tasks and individual exercises for the cultural issues. Self-selected groups chose specific tasks from a prescribed list of options (setting up a journal in molecular gastronomy, developing an electronic tongue, designing a restaurant for synesthetes, organizing a farmers' market, marketing a culinary tour, framing hedonic scales, exploring changing tastes through works of art or recipe books, and crafting beers for space travel). Individual tasks were selected from a menu of options (book reviews, film reviews, conversations, creative writing, and oral exams). A few guest lecturers (wine making, cultural anthropology, film analysis, and nutritional epidemiology) added more flavor.

The patient underwent successful repair of the urethrocutaneous fistula in prone position—an approach that has not previously been described in the literature. Repair was performed by the multidisciplinary team of a reconstructive urologist, colorectal surgeon, and plastic surgeon. Post-operative retrograde urethrogram demonstrated the absence of a persistent fistula tract and the patient has been continent for 18 months.

This study evaluated the nutritional quality of hospital patient menus. At three large acute care hospitals in Ontario, Canada, 84 standard menus were evaluated, which included regular and carbohydrate-controlled diets and 3000 mg and 2000 mg sodium diets. Mean levels of calories, macronutrients and vitamins and minerals provided were calculated. Comparisons were made with the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI) and Canada’s Food Guide (CFG) recommendations. Calorie levels ranged from 1281 to 3007 kcal, with 45% of menus below 1600 kcal. Protein ranged from 49 to 159 g (0.9–1.1 g/kg/day). Energy and protein levels were highest in carbohydrate-controlled menus. All regular and carbohydrate-controlled menus provided macronutrients within the Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges. The proportion of regular diet menus meeting the DRIs: 0% for fiber; 7% for calcium; 57% for vitamin C; and 100% for iron. Compared to CFG recommended servings, 35% met vegetables and fruit and milk and alternatives, 11% met grain products and 8% met meat and alternatives. These data support the need for frequent monitoring and evaluation of menus, food procurement and menu planning policies and for sufficient resources to ensure menu quality. ? 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",Energy; Food service; Hospital menus; Malnutrition; Protein,"ascorbic acid; calcium; carbohydrate; iron; mineral; protein; sodium; carbohydrate diet; fat intake; protein intake; adult; Article; caloric intake; Canadas Food Guide; cross-sectional study; diet; dietary fiber; dietary reference intake; fruit; grain; hospital food service; human; macronutrient; male; malnutrition; meat; middle aged; milk; nutritional assessment; nutritional value; vegetable; administration and dosage; aged; analysis; animal; carbohydrate diet; clinical trial; diet; fat intake; health service; hospitalization; multicenter study; nutritional value; Ontario; protein intake; standards; whole grain; Aged; Animals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diet; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Fiber; Dietary Proteins; Energy Intake; Food Service, Hospital; Fruit; Hospitalization; Humans; Male; Menu Planning; Middle Aged; Milk; Nutritive Value; Ontario; Recommended Dietary Allowances; Vegetables; Whole Grains",2-s2.0-84946925923

The Canadian TIA Score accurately determines the risk of subsequent stroke risk; however, it is unclear if physicians will use this new scale or how it will be used. Our objectives were to assess: (1) anticipated use; (2) component face validity; (3) risk strata for stroke within 7 days; and (4) actions required, for a given risk for subsequent stroke based on the proposed Canadian TIA Score. Methods After a rigorous development process (sample selection, key informant interviews, development of questionnaire following Dillman Tailored Design technique, cognitive interviews, and pilot-testing), a survey questionnaire was administered to a random sample of 300 neurologists selected from all neurologists listed in a national medical directory. The surveys were distributed using a modified Dillman technique. Results From a total of 265 eligible surveys, we received 140 (52.8%) completed surveys; 7 of 13 components comprising the Canadian TIA Score were rated as ""very important"" or ""important"" by survey respondents. Risk categories for subsequent stroke were defined as: minimal risk: less than 1%; low risk: 2%-4.9%; high risk: 5%-10%; critical risk: more than 10% risk of subsequent stroke within 7 days. Most (87.1%) of the neurologists would use a validated Canadian TIA Score. Conclusions Neurologists appear ready to use a validated Canadian TIA Score in their clinical practice. Risk strata are definable, which may allow physicians to determine immediate actions, based on subsequent stroke risk. ? 2015 National Stroke Association. Published by Elsevier Inc.

The premise of the primary report in that debate was that by considering IVF outcomes differently-by focusing on healthy singleton birth at term rather than clinical pregnancy, the standard currency at that time-the necessary shift toward reduced numbers of embryos transferred might be accelerated. The choice of end-point in that debate-Birth Emphasizing a Successful Singleton at Term (BESST)-was not an effort to 'dumb down' the complex equation linking risks and benefits. That balance is a dynamic and various mix of issues that clinicians discuss with patients on a daily basis. And BESST was certainly not proposed as a new primary outcome for application to other treatment modalities in reproductive medicine, such as ovulation induction. It was simply a responsible and brave call for change in the accelerating and competitive world of IVF. ? 2015 The Author 2015.",Adverse outcomes; IVF outcomes; Morbidity; Multiple pregnancy; Treatment effectiveness,adverse outcome; Article; embryo transfer; fertilization in vitro; gold standard; human; morbidity; ovulation induction; pregnancy; reproduction; female; infertility; procedures; standards; Female; Humans; Infertility; Pregnancy; Reproductive Medicine,2-s2.0-84943279793

We hypothesize that their accuracy for early diagnosis will be as good as the diagnosis at a later stage. We furthermore hypothesize that there will be no differences in diagnostic accuracy between the different molecular tests when evaluated against the same reference standard. We defined early detection as a period that is consistently between one and three weeks (Busch 1997; Fiebig 2003). The secondary objective of this review is to assess the influence of sources of heterogeneity on the diagnostic accuracy of tests performed, in particular the type of HIV (HIV-1 or HIV-2), different cut-offvalues, different samples, the healthcare setting, age of the participants, differences in timing of the tests, to investigate how the time of testing relates to accuracy; and study design features. ? 2015 The Cochrane Collaboration.",,Article; priority journal; retracted article,2-s2.0-85041857842

This technique, which could also be used for drying other biopharmaceutical products such as vaccines, is being proposed as a simpler, faster and a significantly more cost-effective alternative to lyophilization. Protein and water are separated primarily by capillary-action based water absorption into an asymmetric ultrafiltration membrane, and selective retention of protein on the membrane surface by sieving. There is no requirement for sophisticated and expensive equipment as this technique can be carried out on the laboratory bench-top at ambient conditions, i.e. without either freezing or application of vacuum.

Poststernotomy mediastinitis can in uncommon instances give rise to sternocutaneous fistulas in 0.25% to 10% of cases. Although scant reports have documented prosthetic valve endocarditis occurring in a setting of deep sternal wire infections, it is an infrequent but well-documented fatal complication of valvular replacement surgery. Case Report A 52-year-old male smoker with aortic valve replacement (2011), on Coumadin and Monocor, was found dead on September 2013 with a hole along a surgical scar over the sternum, masquerading as a gunshot wound. Chest radiograph revealed no foreign body, and no evidence of homicidal/suicidal or accidental cause was found at autopsy. Examination revealed a chronic fistulous tract from a deep sternal wire infection to the skin, in addition to a chronic sinus tract eroding into the root of the aorta with recent prosthetic valve endocarditis. Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first case report documenting poststernotomy mediastinitis causing a simultaneous occurrence of sternocutaneous fistula and prosthetic valve endocarditis.

We recently demonstrated that girls with TS have normal aerobic but altered skeletal muscle anaerobic metabolism compared to healthy controls (HC). The purpose of this study was to compare peripheral skeletal muscle microvascular function in girls with TS to HC after exercise. We hypothesized that girls with TS would have similar muscle blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal responses during recovery from exercise compared to HC. Methods: Thirteen TS participants and 8 HC completed testing. BOLD MRI was used to measure skeletal muscle microvascular response during 60. second recovery, following 60. s of exercise at 65% of maximal workload. Exercise and recovery were repeated four times, and the BOLD signal time course was fit to a four-parameter sigmoid function. Results: Participants were 13.7 ± 3.1. years old and weighed 47.9 ± 14.6. kg. The mean change in BOLD signal intensity following exercise at the end of recovery, the mean response time of the function/the washout of deoxyhemoglobin, and the mean half-time of recovery were similar between the TS and HC groups. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that compared to HC, peripheral skeletal muscle microvascular function following exercise in girls with TS is not impaired. General significance: This study supports the idea that the aerobic energy pathway is not impaired in children with TS in response to submaximal exercise. Other mechanisms are likely responsible for exercise intolerance in TS; this needs to be further investigated. ? 2014.",BOLD MRI; Exercise; Microvascular function; Pediatric; Skeletal muscle; Turner syndrome,adolescent; adult; anaerobic metabolism; Article; blood oxygenation; body composition; BOLD signal; child; clinical article; controlled study; demography; exercise; female; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; school child; skeletal muscle; test retest reliability; Turner syndrome; workload,2-s2.0-84916896308

Canadian students represent the majority of international applicants and matriculants to US colleges of osteopathic medicine (COMs); however, to our knowledge, no studies have explored this population. Objective: To gain a better understanding of Canadian students attending US colleges of osteopathic medicine by examining their residency training preference, visa preference, intent to practice in the United States or Canada, receptiveness to incorporating osteopathic manipulative medicine into practice, specialty preference, estimated debt incurred, and effect of debt on specialty choice. Methods: A 10-question electronic survey was sent to Canadian osteopathic medical students in the 17 COMs and branch campuses that accept international applicants. The initial survey pool consisted of first-, second-, third-, and fourth-year medical students (classes of 2014-2017) compiled from a database managed by the Canadian Osteopathic Medical Student Association. Results: Of the 102 students contacted, 66 (65%) completed the survey. Respondents had a strong desire to practice in Canada (44 [67%]) but were considering an Accreditation Council on Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) or dually accredited residency program in the United States (46 [70%] and 15 [23%], respectively) that would sponsor an H1B visa. Respondents were receptive to incorporating osteopathic manipulative medicine into practice (44 [67%]). Most respondents chose non-primary care specialties (40 [61%]) and incurred a debt of more than $200,000 (44 of 65 [68%]); however, debt had a limited influence on respondents’ choice of specialty (χ23=1.911; P=.591). Conclusion: Most respondents planned to complete ACGME training, to return to Canada to practice medicine, and to practice in a non-primary care specialty. As a growing population that will play a large role in the expansion and reception of the profession internationally, Canadian osteopathic medical students and US-trained Canadian DOs merit further examination. ? 2015 American Osteopathic Association.",,"accreditation; Canada; decision making; education; health care personnel; human; medical education; medical student; osteopathic medicine; procedures; questionnaire; statistics and numerical data; Accreditation; Canada; Career Choice; Education, Medical, Graduate; Health Personnel; Humans; Internship and Residency; Osteopathic Medicine; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-84956551654

Children with hypertension and pre-hypertension demonstrate LVH and greater LVMI compared to normotensive children. The impact of blood pressure (BP) on early changes in left ventricular properties provides an opportunity to understand and identify cardiovascular risk early in childhood. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess left ventricular structural and functional properties in a sample of children across a wide range of BP values. Subjects and methods: Children aged 11-14-years were divided into BP groups: hypertensives (HTN; 95th percentile; n=21) and normotensives (NTN; <90th percentile; n=85) based on BP measures taken at two time points. Resting supine heart rate (HR), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were collected along with left ventricular structural and functional properties using ultrasound sonography. Results: LVMI and TPR were not different between groups. CO, HR and left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes were elevated in the HTN group. Furthermore, HR and body mass index were found to be independent predictors of BP group status in children. Conclusion: These findings show that children with elevated BP are characterized by high HR and CO and normal TPR. Also, the results identify HR as a predictor of BP group status in early childhood. ? 2014 ? 2014 Informa UK Ltd.

It discusses the clinical evidence of effectiveness of phytotherapeutics mainly in relation to the anticancer mechanisms through natural killer (NK) cell enhancement. NK cells play an important role in anticancer immunomodulation. Two commonly used phytotherapeutics, the medicinal mushrooms Lentinula edodes mycelia and Ganoderma lucidum, have been found to elicit their anticancer functions by regulating NK cells. If effects on both NK numbers and toxicity are taken into account, the recommended phytotherapy strategies appear to be Hochu-ekki-to, Shenqi Fuzheng Injection (SFI), and Aidi Injection. The chapter highlights the importance of careful documentation of the clinical effects for both overall survival and quality of life, in relation to potential mechanisms of action for further evidence-based use of selected cancer phytotherapeutics. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

Suicidal behaviour is a significant risk factor for completed suicide and is much more prevalent than completed suicide. Many internal and external factors contribute to the risk of suicidal behaviour. Recent research has focused on biological markers in suicide risk, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is a protein involved in the growth, function, and maintenance of the nervous system. It has been implicated in psychiatric disorders and suicide. While some evidence suggests that reduced levels of BDNF are associated with suicide, the precise relationship has yet to be determined. The aim of this study is to review the literature examining the relationship between levels of BDNF and suicidal behaviour. Methods: A predefined search strategy will be implemented to search the following electronic databases: PubMed/MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), PsycINFO, and Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) from inception. The articles will be screened by two independent authors (RE and SP) using predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus, or by a third author (ZS) in cases of disagreement. The primary outcome will be the association between levels of BDNF and suicidal behaviour. A meta-analysis will be conducted if appropriate. Quality of evidence and risk of bias will be evaluated.

Governments have a key leadership role to play in this process by setting strategic policies and priorities, implementing and monitoring national plans in the health system and related sectors, and fostering research and evidence-based innovation. Drawing upon a recent study: Success Factors for Women's and Children's Health that analyzed why some countries achieved faster progress than other comparable countries [1], this chapter examines the experience of four low-income countries: Bangladesh, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda. Two of these countries (Bangladesh and Rwanda) were among the ten countries designated as ""fast track"" countries in the above study. The Tanzania story features the role that health systems research has played in this country's health development. The Uganda story includes an account of the ""Healthy Child Uganda"" initiative and the influence it has had on national health policies and practices. The chapter also examines the contribution of two high-income countries to the global effort. They are Canada with the announcement in 2010 by prime minister Harper of the ""Muskoka Initiative"" on maternal, newborn, and child health, and Norway with its special interest in improving global child health, declared by prime minister Stoltenberg in 2007. Some reflections on the experience of both groups of countries are presented. Then building on the lessons learned from these national ""stories"", the synthesis highlights key government strategies that appear to be most effective in improving maternal and child health around the world. ? 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Each year nearly 289,000 die another twenty million suffer from non-fatal, but significant complications of pregnancy. These devastating deaths and disabilities of mothers are attributable to three delays: delays in the home, in transportation and at the health care facilities. The problems created by these delays are compounded by the low rate of deliveries that are assisted by skilled birth attendants, the low utilization of modern contraceptive methods and poor access to quality care. Of course, the health of babies and children is intricately linked to the health of the mothers who deliver them. Around the world, 3.6 million newborns die annually with another 2.65 million unborn babies dying before birth. Well-documented innovations and models to improve maternal care have been established with some countries using locally developed social and economic interventions along with clinical and facility based inputs and especially the provision of Emergency Obstetric and Neonatal Care (EmONC). A central theme is ensuring mothers (and their babies) have a safe and dignified delivery. The world's attention focused on mothers and children through the Millennium Development Goals, which were the main global development objectives for the first 15 years of the new millennium. The promotion of women's and children's rights and education-along with a trans-disciplinary approach to safe motherhood-play an important role in realizing genuine, sustainable improvement in the lives of millions of mothers and their dependent children. Despite some regional gains and a shift in global focus to maternal/newborn/child health, these foundational steps continue to be major challenges for communities, governments and international organizations. ? 2015 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It has led to an increase in: interventions, measurement of impact, and financial/human resources targeted toward maternal/newborn health around the world. Models to evaluate the nature and impact of this advocacy have been developed including the four-factor approach of Shiffman. Advocates are trans-disciplinary, represent high, low and middle income countries, and include cultural leaders (such as actors and musicians). Important global traction has been achieved through policy windows such as the Millennium Development Goals (and the post-2015 Development Agenda). Initiatives such as Mother Baby Friendly Hospitals from Save the Mothers and the Federation of International Gynecologists and Obstetricians are working toward ensuring access to quality care and safe, dignified deliveries at health facilities.

Indeed, we are confronted by a number of major global infections, such as HIV and tuberculosis, that have complex methods of pathogenesis, that can be antigenically diverse, and that evolved significant mechanisms to evade human immune responses. The challenge for producing vaccines against these agents is knowing the type of immune responses critical for control of infection. The use of recombinant viral vectors provides a novel approach for delivering genes encoding antigens of a different pathogen as a vaccine. Here we aim to provide an overview of recombinant viral vectors that can be utilized for mucosal immunization and a current review of outcomes of human trials involving these viral vectors. Although RV144 was marginally effective, there were also setbacks in HIV vaccine trials involving Ad5 vectors. Importantly, exciting progress has been made in identification of novel vectors that induce local mucosal control of early infection and significantly improve the breadth of T cell-mediated responses. Indeed, findings concerning local mucosal control of HIV and TB are merging into a comparable storyline that may offer control of these pathogens. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.

In addition, three rare epithelial carcinomas were considered emerging or provisional entities: thyroid-like follicular RCC; succinate dehydrogenase B deficiency-associated RCC; and ALK-translocation RCC. There were also a number of suggested modifications to existing WHO 2004 categories with the new classification to be known as the ISUP Vancouver Classification. Tumor morphotype, sarcomatoid/rhabdoid differentiation and tumor necrosis were identified as significant prognostic parameters for RCC. The ISUP Grading System was accepted with grades 1-3 of clear cell and papillary RCC being based upon nucleolar prominence, while extreme nuclear pleomorphism, or sarcomatoid and/or rhabdoid differentiation defined grade 4 tumors. It was agreed that chromophobe RCC should not be graded. Consensus guidelines were formulated for specimen handling and it was agreed that renal sinus invasion is present when the tumor is in direct contact with fat or the loose connective tissue of the sinus, or if there is involvement of endothelial lined spaces within the renal sinus, regardless of size.

Informed by the National Implementation Research Network model and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research meta-theory, our primary study aim is to increase the capacity of Ontario-based therapists to provide family-based treatment, by providing training and ongoing supervision. Methods/design: We will use a multi-site case study with a mixed method pre/post design to examine several implementation outcomes across four eating disorder treatment programs. We will provide a training workshop on family-based treatment as well as ongoing monthly supervision. In addition, we will assemble implementation teams at each site and coach them by phone on a monthly basis regarding any process issues. Our main outcomes include fidelity to the treatment model using quantitative evaluation of audio-recorded therapy sessions, as well as qualitative analysis of the perceptions of the implementation process using audio-recorded focus groups with all clinicians and administrators involved in the study. Discussion: To our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate an implementation strategy for an evidence-based treatment for eating disorders. Challenges to date include obtaining ethics approval at all sites, and recruitment. This research will help to inform future studies on how to best implement evidence-based treatments in this field. ?

Methods: Four raters individually linked 145 items from the measures based on standardized linking rules. Interrater agreement was determined. For items where there was no agreement among raters, the opinion of a fifth rater, an expert in applying the ICF, was obtained. Results: The items were linked to 74 ICF categories across the three measures. Final interrater agreement was 83.3%. The content of all three measures was highly linkable with ICF. The HDQ had the best representation among the three measures. The HDQ had 27 items linked with the generic and disability core set; of these 16 items were linked with disability codes.

The aim of this prospective cohort study was to assess whether a relationship exists between acute postoperative pain after radial head arthroplasty (RHAP) and chronic functional impairment (CFI) 2 years after surgery. Methods. A total of 59 patients who underwent RHAP for acute radial head fractures were included in the study. Pain subscale of the condition-specific American Shoulder and Elbow Evaluation Instrument (ASES-e) and the region-specific Disability of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire at baseline (within 3 days of surgery) and at the 2-year follow-up were used to assess the relationship between acute postsurgical pain and CFI 2 years after RHAP. Stepwise regression modeling was used. Results. Higher baseline ASES-e pain subscale significantly improved the predictive ability of the regression model, accounting for 24.4% of variation. Patients with a score of 31.5/50 on the ASES-e pain subscale were four times more likely to experience reduced functional outcomes as indicated by their DASH score (?20/100). Discussion. Acute postoperative pain predicts CFI at the 2-year follow-up after RHAP.

The initial search strategy resulted in 416 citations, of which we to used eight articles. Nine PROMs were found to be validated in the hand trauma population: Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire and two variations of the DASH: Manchester-Modified Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (M2 DASH) and QuickDASH; Michigan Hand Outcomes questionnaire (MHQ); Cold Intolerance Symptom Severity questionnaire (CISS); Cold Sensitivity Severity questionnaire (CSS); Injured Workers Survey (IWS); and Hand Assessment Tool (HAT). Reliability and responsiveness data were also identified. We found that sufficient psychometric results existed only for DASH and MHQ and believe that both should be considered for use with all hand injury cases.

Despite variable and often severe neurological symptoms, the vast majority of the approximately 2.5 million people worldwide with MS describe fatigue as the single-greatest impediment to quality oflife. It is unknown whether fatigue in MS is a direct consequence of disease activity or if instead is secondary to co-morbidities such as medication side effects or depression. Regardless of its cause, physical exercise is becoming increasingly recognized as a safe and efficacious therapeutic approach for managing MS-related fatigue. In fact, there now exist evidence-based physical activity guidelines designed specifically for adults with MS. It remains unclear how peripheral adaptations might ameliorate symptoms originating centrally. Resolving such a paradox requires an understanding of exercise-induced changes at multiple levels of analysis spanning the molecule to the psyche. Mounting evidence for the safety and efficacy of physical activity together with the availability and relative affordability of exercise and rehabilitation facilities places this treatment modality as a potentially potent combatant in the fight against MS fatigue. ? 2015 by Begell House, Inc.",Exercise; Fatigue; Multiple sclerosis,Article; clinical effectiveness; comorbidity; depression; disease activity; evidence based medicine; exercise; fatigue; human; multiple sclerosis; muscle fatigue; patient safety; physical activity; practice guideline; priority journal; quality of life; rehabilitation center; symptomatology,2-s2.0-85031396574

Indeed, alleged medical negligence or malpractice is emblematic of the underlying dissonance in what should otherwise be an ideal therapeutic relationship between physicians and patients. The increasing incidence of alleged medical negligence in the West and in the Muslim world has led physicians to fear the threat of litigation. Consequently, this results in defensive medicine, avoiding higher risk medical and surgical specialties or procedures, and potentially adversarial patient-physician interactions. Medical schools have adopted white coat ceremonies as a symbolic attempt to inculcate students in the healing tradition and; along with the pledging of the Hippocratic Oath, to imbue them with a sense of compassion and duty towards the ill. Such endeavors should serve to motivate trainees and physicians to respond to suffering with continued empathy and effort rather than with suspicion and fear of an unfavorable outcome or alleged negligence. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to offer a novel, complimentary approach to the white coat ceremony and the pledging of the Hippocratic Oath, by discerning the Islamic principles of Iman (faith) and Ihsan (a call to virtue) to define an appropriate healing relationship between physicians and patients. In order to introduce students to this tradition of healing, this alternative approach may be introduced, taught, and modeled for physicians-in-training in their actual clinical practice. Philosophical Perspective: Since inception of the white coat ceremony in 1993, the Hippocratic perspective has been applied to inculcate a sense of compassion and duty to the ill. Along with recognition of the Human Condition or Fitra; the concept of Iman and Ihsan within the Muslim world should be applied by physicians-in-training to define their duty and their approach to future patients, themselves and their Creator. Such an approach demands a higher level calling than that outlined by the expected standards of Islamic law or Shari’a. Conclusion: Instilling Iman and Ihsan principles as an embedded component of medical treatment potentially should curtail medical malpractice exposure, simplify due process, and improve patient physician healing relationships. ? 2015, Yozmot Heiliger Ltd.

This study aimed to capture the ingress and egress strategies employed by older drivers in order to understand the relationship between balance and mobility and movement patterns. A sample of healthy older drivers (n=15; aged 72.5±7.9) and those with mobility impairments (n=17; aged 71.3±6.0) were captured entering and exiting four vehicle models using an adjustable vehicle mock-up. As well, semi-structured interviews and ride-a-longs were conducted with a sub-group (n=7) of participants with mobility impairments in order to explore how bodily changes associated with aging impact vehicle usability. There were no significant differences across vehicle models in terms of ingress, but there were with egress. Particular movement strategies used by both groups are discussed with regard to safety. Through this movement analyses, such evidence can be used to develop innovations that inform the next generation of vehicles that consider the needs of older users.

These limitations can have significant financial impacts on patients and families related to both chronic and acute illnesses. Previous published research has shown significant financial burdens for homecare, devices and pharmaceuticals in diseases like cancer. Examination of existing funding policies raises the question: Can we restructure, or redistribute government funding in a way that minimizes these burdens to the most vulnerable populations (typically those under age 65 and in the lowest income quartile).Current Ontario policies related to pharmaceutical reimbursement were reviewed, and an alternate policy strategy that might better address patient level burden is presented using a case study approach, with the goal of mitigating financial burden. Cost neutrality could be obtained via offsets through higher co-payments in other populations to ensure no increase to existing funding envelopes. ? 2015 Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology.",Cost-sharing; Insurance coverage; Patient out-of-pocket costs; Pharmaceutical policy,Article; breast cancer; budget; Canada; cancer diagnosis; cancer patient; cystic fibrosis; drug cost; drug program; funding; health care policy; health service; hospital running cost; human; long term care; lowest income group; new drugs funding program; ontario drug benefit program; reimbursement; schizophrenia; special drugs program,2-s2.0-84955097406

Methods An Excel-based model was developed to compare the cost of prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding early after intensive care admission using the current intravenous (IV) pantoprazole formulation versus omeprazole IR oral suspension. Total costs included the cost of acid suppressive drugs and related clinical outcomes. Inputs were obtained from a local clinical trial, the Ministry of Health database, insurance organizations, hospital and pharmacy registries, the relevant literature, and expert opinion. The robustness of the input data was investigated by one-way sensitivity analysis. The model was developed based on the results of a randomized control trial (RCT), in which experimental and control groups received omeprazole and pantoprazole, respectively. Results According to the proposed model, the cost of gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding prevention using pantoprazole IV was US$ 950,000 while US$ 750,000 was spent on receiving omeprazole oral suspension. These costs led to the annual cost-saving of almost US$ 200,000 (US$4 per member, per month) for the health care system. Conclusion In the present study, a budget impact analysis was performed to assess the financial consequences of using omeprazole IR oral suspension in place of pantoprazole IV for prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding. The better preventive effect of omeprazole IR oral suspension when compared with conventional therapy using pantoprazole IV was the major reason for the final comparative budgetary savings. ? 2015 Journal of Population Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology.",Budget impact; Critically ill patients; Oral suspension; Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs); Upper GI bleeding,"ceftriaxone; imipenem; levofloxacin; omeprazole; pantoprazole; sultamicillin; 2 [[(2 pyridyl)methyl]sulfinyl]benzimidazole derivative; omeprazole; pantoprazole; proton pump inhibitor; suspension; Article; budget; complication; critically ill patient; gastrointestinal hemorrhage; health care cost; health care system; human; information processing; randomized controlled trial (topic); sensitivity analysis; treatment outcome; ventilator associated pneumonia; critical illness; drug cost; economics; intravenous drug administration; oral drug administration; suspension; 2-Pyridinylmethylsulfinylbenzimidazoles; Administration, Oral; Critical Illness; Drug Costs; Humans; Infusions, Intravenous; Omeprazole; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Suspensions",2-s2.0-84955065691

It then outlines in a step-wise manner how trend analysis using a relatively large exposure database can be used to estimate such exposure. The process of how a large database containing exposure measurements can be prepared for estimating historic occupational exposures of individual workers in relation to their illnesses is described. The asbestos subset from a large government collected air monitoring database called Medical Surveillance (MESU) was selected to illustrate the cleaning and analysis processes. After unidentifiable values were removed, the cleaned dataset was examined for possible sources of variability such as changes to sampling protocol. Limit of detection (LOD) values were substituted for all non-detectable values prior to the calculation of descriptive statistic using left censored analysis methods (i.e., maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), Kaplan Meier (KM), and simple substitution). The JoinPoint Regression Program was used to perform trend analysis and calculate an annual percentage change (APC) value for the available sampling period. An asbestos case study is presented to illustrate how the APC can then be combined with more recent job and/or process specific exposure data to estimate historic levels. The MESU asbestos dataset contained 1,610 samples from 1984-1995. An average of 17% of this data was left censored. The asbestos air sampling methods in Ontario changed around 1990. LOD values of 0.06 f/cc and 0.02 f/cc were substituted for LOD values pre-and post-1990, respectively. The annual mean fiber levels for the MLE method were an average of 44% lower than KM and substitution methods. The corresponding APC for MLE method was-6.5% and-7.7% for KM and simple substitution. The findings of this paper illustrate how the temporal trend of an exposure databases can be used to efficiently estimate historic contaminant levels in the presence of limited historical information. ? 2015 Copyright ? 2015 JOEH, LLC.",censored data; individualized retrospective exposure assessment; MESU database; trend analysis,"air pollutant; asbestos; air pollutant; analysis; factual database; history; human; limit of detection; Occupational Diseases; occupational exposure; Ontario; population growth; retrospective study; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Asbestos; Databases, Factual; History, 20th Century; Humans; Likelihood Functions; Limit of Detection; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Ontario; Population Growth; Retrospective Studies",2-s2.0-84946749725

Microvascular flow, as measured by myocardial blush grade (MPG), predicts mortality after PPCI. Despite initial enthusiasm, current evidence does not support routine use of Intracoronary over intravenous glycoprotein 2b3a inhibitors during PPCI for ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) to improve clinical outcomes. Manual thrombectomy (MT) improves MPG and reduces distal embolisation in meta-analyses of small trials. A single-centre trial (N=1071), the Thrombus aspiration during percutaneous coronary intervention in acute myocardial infarction study (TAPAS) trial showed a mortality reduction, which led guidelines to recommend routine manual aspiration. However, the largest randomised trial (Thrombus aspiration in ST-elevation myocardial infarction in Scandinavia [TASTE] trial, N=7021) showed no difference in mortality and only trends towards reduction in myocardial infarction (MI) and stent thrombosis. The TASTE trial had much lower than expected mortality and so was likely underpowered for modest but important treatment effects (20-30 % RRR). The Thrombectomy with PCI versus PCI alone in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI (TOTAL) trial (N=10,700) will determine if MT reduces important clinical events during PPCI.

This disorder is one of the most common psychiatric conditions in children and adolescents and often presents with comorbid anxiety and mood disorders. Although the onset of SAD is typically in late childhood or early adolescence, most afflicted individuals go undiagnosed for years, not seeking treatment until adulthood. Evidence-based first-line treatment of SAD in adults includes the use of both pharmacotherapy and cognitive–behavioral therapy. There is emerging data in adolescents with SAD which supports the use of similar treatments in this population. This chapter will review the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and comorbid disorders including selective mutism and avoidant personality disorder, as well as the pharmacological treatment of SAD in youth. Randomized controlled trials examining selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, as well as other antidepressants in youth with SAD will be reviewed.

Limited data are available concerning the incidence of these tumors in low-income countries, due to lack of proper cancer registries and shortage of publications. The management of childhood brain tumors faces several challenges in countries with limited resources. Delayed presentation, insufficient number of specialists (pediatric neurosurgeons, pediatric oncologists, and radiation oncologists), and shortage of radiological diagnostic tools like MRI, of neurosurgical equipment, or of radiation machines are significant obstacles. In addition, abandonment of treatment and loss of follow-up are common, mostly for social or economic reasons. Pediatric neuro-oncology is relatively a new subspecialty and requires close multidisciplinary teamwork. This is attempted but not efficiently executed in many developing countries. Some of these difficulties can be managed by enriching the resources through international collaborations; others may need shared experience with more advanced countries through twinning programs.

In the first step, 3D MR and TRUS images are aligned rigidly using six pairs of manually identified approximate matching points on the boundary of the prostate. Then, two image volumes are non-rigidly registered using a finite element method (FEM)-based linear elastic deformation model. A vector of observation prediction errors at some points of interest within the prostate volume is computed using an intensity-based similarity metric called the modality independent neighborhood descriptor (MIND). The error vector is employed in a classical state estimation framework to estimate prostate deformation between MR and TRUS images. The points of interests are identified using speeded-up robust features (SURF) that are scale and rotation-invariant descriptors in MR images. The proposed registration method on 10 sets of prostate MR and TRUS images yielded a target registration error of 1.99±0.83 mm, and 1.97±0.87 mm in the peripheral zone (PZ) and whole gland (WG), respectively, using 68 manually-identified fiducial points. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was 87.9±2.9, 82.3±4.8, 93.0±1.7, and 84.2±6.2 percent for the WG, apex, mid-gland and base of the prostate, respectively. Moreover, the mean absolute distances (MAD) between the WG surfaces in the TRUS and registered MR images was 1.6±0.3 mm. Registration results indicate effectiveness of the proposed method in improving the targeting accuracy in the TRUS-guided prostate biopsy. ? 2015 SPIE.",3D MRI-TRUS non-rigid registration; deformation state estimation; finite element method; prostate cancer; TRUS-guided targeted prostate biopsy,Biopsy; Diseases; Errors; Finite element method; Image processing; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance imaging; Medical imaging; Rigidity; State estimation; Urology; Deformation state; Nonrigid registration; Nonrigid registration method; Prostate biopsy; Prostate cancers; Speeded up robust features; Target registration errors; Transrectal ultrasound images; Medical image processing,2-s2.0-84943374948

The purpose was to summarize the evidence for dosing, frequency, definition of tolerance, and dose conversions between opioids in cancer patients administered various fentanyl ROO preparations. A literature search was conducted and 16 studies identified. Each definition varied but the majority classified BTP as a transient flare. The lowest OTFC starting dose of 200 mcg was used in all but two studies, 100 mcg for both sublingual and buccal preparations and 50mg for intranasal fentanyl. Six of the nine OTFC studies as well as the intranasal study also noted that patients should not receive more than four doses in a 24-hour period. The maximum number of doses of sublingual per day varied in each study. The most common symptoms regardless of the formulation were nausea, vomiting and constipation. BTP is a severe transitory pain that is sudden in onset and has a short duration. Many forms of fentanyl have been utilized in management of BTP. An entry dose of 60 mg of oral morphine was required in a majority of the studies and adverse events were as expected in patients medicated with opioids. The majority of patients required more than the minimum dose. Beginning treatment with larger doses would reduce the time to onset of pain relief. Future studies should investigate using larger doses in the prospective setting. ?

Patient decision aids (PtDAs) supplement advice from health care professionals by communicating the absolute risk or benefit of treatment options (i.e., X/100). As such, PtDAs have been amenable to binary outcomes only. We aimed to develop and test the validity of the Conversion to Risk Estimates through Application of Normal Theory (CREATE) method for estimating absolute risk based on continuous outcome data. Methods. CREATE is designed to derive an estimate of the proportion of those who experience a clinically relevant degree of change (CRDoC). We used a 2-stage validation process using real and simulated change score data, respectively. First, using raw data from published intervention trials, we calculated the proportion of patients with a CRDoC and compared that with our CREATE-derived estimate using chi-square tests of association. Second, 200,000 simulated distributions of change scores were generated with widely varying distribution characteristics. Actual and CREATE-derived estimates were compared for each simulated distribution, and relative differences were summarized graphically. Results. The absolute difference between the estimated and actual CRDoC did not exceed 5% for any of the samples based on real data. Applying the CREATE method to 200,000 simulated scenarios demonstrated that the CREATE method should be avoided for outcomes where the underlying distribution can be reasonably assumed to have high levels of skew or kurtosis. Conclusion. Our results suggest that standard statistical theory can be used to estimate continuous outcomes in absolute terms with reasonable accuracy for use in PtDAs; caution is advised if outcome summary statistics are assumed to have been derived from highly skewed distributions. ? 2015 Society for Medical Decision Making.",continuous outcomes; normal statistical theory; risk communication; validation study,Cardiovascular Diseases; computer simulation; decision making; decision support system; human; meta analysis (topic); procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); risk assessment; treatment outcome; validation study; Cardiovascular Diseases; Choice Behavior; Computer Simulation; Decision Support Techniques; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Risk Assessment; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84942933200

We explored interactions between higher vs. lower systolic BP (SBP) targets and anthropometric measures (body mass index (BMI), body surface area (BSA), height, weight) and recurrent stroke and death in the Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3) Trial. METHODS Patients with recent magnetic resonance imaging-proven lacunar infarcts were randomized to 2 BP targets (130-149 mm Hg vs. <130) in a prospective, open-label, blinded end-point design. Time to outcome was evaluated with Cox proportional hazard models and compared between targets. We examined multiplicative interactions between each anthropometric measure and target and mean difference in achieved BP 1 year after randomization between BP groups by quartile. We also computed rates of recurrent stroke and death by quartiles of anthropometrics. RESULTS Three thousand and twenty patients were followed over a mean of 3.7 (SD 2.0) years. Mean age was 63; 63% were male. Mean height was 167 (SD 11) cm, weight 81 (18) kg, BMI 29 (5.9) kg/m2, and BSA 1.9 (0.25) m2. Achieved BP at 1 year was comparable between quartiles for each anthropometric measurement. We found no consistent interactions between BP target and anthropometrics for either outcome, nor were there any significant associations between hazard of stroke or death when assessed by BMI, BSA, height, or weight. CONCLUSIONS We found no interactions between BP target groups and quartiles of anthropometrics for rates of stroke and death in SPS3. There is no evidence at this time supporting body size-based modifications to current BP targets for secondary prevention after lacunar stroke. ? American Journal of Hypertension, Ltd 2014.

The secondary aim was to contrast this information with characteristics of high acuity users. We also sought to determine what factors were predictive of leaving without being seen (LWBS). Methods: This retrospective descriptive correlational study explored characteristics and factors predictive of low acuity ED utilization. The sample included all FHT patients with ED visits in 2011. The last ED record was chosen for review. Sex, age, Canadian Triage and Acuity Scale (CTAS), presenting complaint(s), time of day, day of week, number of visits, and diagnosis were recorded. Results: Of 1580 patients who visited the ED in 2011, 56% were CTAS 1–3 visits, 24% CTAS 4–5 and 20% had no CTAS recorded. Patients who were older than age 65 were approximately half as likely to have a CTAS level of 4–5 compared to younger patients (OR = 0.605, CI = 0.441,0.829). Patients older than age 65 were 1.75 times more likely to be CTAS level 1–2 (OR = 1.745, CI = 1.277, 2.383). Patients who went to the ED during the day were less likely to LWBS compared to night visits (OR = 0.697, CI = 0.532, 0.912). Interpretation: Most low acuity ED utilization is by patients under the age of 65, while high acuity ED utilization is more common among patients older than age 65.

The goal of this study was to develop a screening migraine questionnaire that could be easily implemented by a general pediatrician and validate its use in diagnosing migraine in children 5-12 years old. Methods A questionnaire, the McMaster Migraine Tool, was developed using the International Classification of Headache Disorders-II criteria for migraine. The validity of the questionnaire was assessed by comparing the diagnosis based on the results of the questionnaire compared with the diagnosis made by a pediatric neurologist. Results The questionnaire was used to assess a cohort of 69 children referred to the Pediatric Neurology Clinic for headache. The sensitivity and specificity of the McMaster Migraine Tool were determined to be 84% and 69%, respectively. Families graded its ease of use to be 9 of 10 (10 being easy to use). Conclusion The McMaster Migraine Tool may be useful in diagnosing migraine in 5-12-year-old children, as it is readily completed and regarded as easy to use. Application of this tool could lead to expedited diagnosis and management of migraine. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Our data show that there is a high affinity interaction between CaM and SOX-CAL (27 ± 9 nM), and that SOX-CAL bound to the same location as the well-known CaM antagonist melittin; unexpectedly, we also found that addition of CaM-binding small molecules initially produced increased SOX-CAL binding, indicative of binding to both the well-known high-affinity CaM binding site and a second, lower-affinity binding site. ? 2014 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

In The anatomy, Thomas Willis explicitly connected the cognitive faculties and the nerves. Willis' later, 1672 work, The two discourses concerning the soul of brutes, severely undermined the materialism of Willis' first study: he affirmed dualism and cognitive immateriality; changed the anatomical locations of cognition; and reasserted a division between the rational and sensitive souls. His exact motive to return to orthodoxy is unclear, but contemporary scholarship of Willis has compounded the confusion with by relying predominantly on The soul of brutes instead of The anatomy. We trace Willis' career and examine his methodological practices, which help explain the historical practices and pressures. A closer examination of Willis' Anatomy of the brain reveals a much more materialistic account of the brain, the faculties, and nervous system. In this article, we present our own analysis of Willis' concept of rationality in the Anatomy and explain its importance for nervous physiology and understanding the analytic techniques for first defining faculty localizations.

The SPC scheme is intended to compensate for altered phase response and group delay differences in the auditory nerve spiking patterns in impaired ears. Based on theoretical models of loudness and the hypothesized importance of temporal fine structure for intelligibility, the compensations of the SPC scheme are expected to provide benefit; however, preliminary experiments revealed that listeners preferred unprocessed or minimally processed speech as opposed to complete SPC processed speech. DESIGN:: An improved version of the SPC scheme was evaluated with a computational auditory model in response to a synthesized vowel at multiple SPLs. The impaired model auditory nerve response to SPC-aided stimuli was compared to the unaided stimuli for spectrotemporal response similarity to the healthy auditory model. This comparison included analysis of synchronized rate across auditory nerve characteristic frequencies and a measure of relative phase response of auditory nerve fibers to complex stimuli derived from cross-correlations. RESULTS:: Analysis indicates that SPC can improve a metric of relative phase response at low SPLs, but may do so at the cost of decreased spectrotemporal response similarity to the healthy auditory model and degraded synchrony to vowel formants. In-depth analysis identifies several technical and conceptual problems associated with SPC that need to be addressed. These include the following: (1) a nonflat frequency response through the analysis-synthesis filterbank that results from time-varying changes in the relative temporal alignment of filterbank channels, (2) group delay corrections that are based on incorrect frequencies because of spread of synchrony in auditory nerve responses, and (3) frequency modulations in the processed signal created by the insertion of delays. CONCLUSIONS:: Despite these issues, SPC provided benefit to an error metric derived from auditory nerve response cross-correlations at low SPLs, which may mean phase adjustment is achieved at the expense of other metrics, but could be beneficial for low-level speech. ? 2013 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Auditory nerve response; Computational model; Group delay adjustment; Hearing aid algorithm; Phase response,"algorithm; animal; article; cat; cochlea; cochlear nerve; computer simulation; hair cell; hearing; hearing aid; physiology; Algorithms; Animals; Auditory Perception; Cats; Cochlea; Cochlear Nerve; Computer Simulation; Hair Cells, Auditory; Hearing Aids",2-s2.0-84894593616

The purpose of this study was to assess the association between household income strata and therapeutic goal achievement rates for LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) (< 2.5 mmol/L) in Canadian diabetic patients. Methods: Data (household income, cardiovascular risk factors, drug profile, clinical and laboratory variables) were obtained from a previous cross-sectional study of diabetic patients who filled a prescription for a lipid-lowering drug in selected pharmacies across Canada. Telephone interviews were conducted. Physicians, identified by the participating patients, were requested to complete a short questionnaire for clinical data. Achievement of LDL-C goals according to the Canadian diabetes guidelines were assessed and incorporated into regression models corresponding to household income strata. Results: Seven household income strata were defined in the cohort (from less than 20,000 CDN$ up to 70,000 CDN$ by increments of 10,000 CDN$). LDL-C goals were attained in 34% of patients in the total cohort. There were no significant difierences amongst household income strata for LDL-C goal achievement (p = 0.80). There were no signifi-cant difierences in patient characteristics (age, sex, BMI) and cardiovascular risks according to the household income strata in this cohort, except age more than 65 in the lower income strata. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that household income was not a factor to achieve therapeutic goals for LDL-C for patients with diabetes in this dataset, although goal attainment was less than ideal overall. Future studies should address limitations of this work including small sample size, recruitment bias and lack of data on third party insurance coverage. ? 2014 CIM.",,"antilipemic agent; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; aged; article; blood; Canada; cohort analysis; diabetes mellitus; dyslipidemia; economics; factual database; female; health disparity; human; income; male; middle aged; Aged; Canada; Cholesterol, LDL; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Complications; Dyslipidemias; Female; Health Status Disparities; Humans; Hypolipidemic Agents; Income; Male; Middle Aged",2-s2.0-84894037853

Provision of perioperative analgesia to these patients is challenging for physiological and behavioural reasons. Seven electronic databases were searched to identify papers addressing the perioperative management of analgesia in addicted patients. Principal findings: There are few controlled trials on addiction care in obstetrical management, and controlled trials are lacking in obstetrical analgesia and addiction and in perioperative analgesia and addiction. The focus of the limited number of publications in the obstetrical population is on addiction management during pregnancy and does not address analgesic requirements. There are principle-based discussions on factors affecting analgesic management in patients receiving chronic opioid therapy and multimodal analgesic therapy. This discourse includes consideration of the physiological and affective factors that impact perioperative management. A number of empirically derived protocols available for managing alcohol withdrawal are based on response to the physical manifestations of withdrawal. Protocols for management of patients receiving opioid replacement therapy for opioid addiction are also well described. Nevertheless, evaluations of these protocols are lacking in clinical trials, and the impact of addiction on perioperative outcomes is unknown. Conclusion: Perioperative analgesic management of addicted patients remains poorly understood. Most clinical trials specifically exclude addicted patients.

Empirical research on interventions that promote or enable ICC is sparse so guidance on how to achieve ICC is lacking. Research shows that ICC for diagnosis could be improved. Diagnostic assessment programs (DAPs) appear to be a promising model for enabling ICC. The purpose of this study was to explore how DAP structure and function enable ICC, and whether that may be associated with organizational and clinical outcomes.Methods: A case study approach will be used to explore ICC among eight DAPs that vary by type of cancer (lung, breast), academic status, and geographic region. To describe DAP function and outcomes, and gather information that will enable costing, recommendations expressed in DAP standards and clinical guidelines will be assessed through retrospective observational study. Data will be acquired from databases maintained by participating DAPs and the provincial cancer agency, and confirmed by and supplemented with review of medical records. We will conduct a pilot study to explore the feasibility of estimating the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio using person-level data from medical records and other sources. Interviews will be conducted with health professionals, staff, and referring physicians from each DAP to learn about barriers and facilitators of ICC. Qualitative methods based on a grounded approach will be used to guide sampling, data collection and analysis.Discussion: Findings may reveal opportunities for unique structures, interventions or tools that enable ICC that could be developed, implemented, and evaluated through future research. This information will serve as a formative needs assessment to identify the nature of ongoing or required improvements, which can be directly used by our decision maker collaborators, and as a framework by policy makers, cancer system managers, and DAP managers elsewhere to strategically plan for and implement diagnostic cancer services. ? 2014 Gagliardi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Breast cancer; Communication; Cooperative behavior; Diagnostic assessment program; Inter-professional collaborative care; Inter-professional relations; Lung cancer; Multidisciplinary care team,article; breast tumor; cooperation; cost; diagnostic procedure; female; human; lung tumor; male; methodology; organization and management; patient care; pilot study; practice guideline; public relations; system analysis; Breast Neoplasms; Cooperative Behavior; Costs and Cost Analysis; Diagnostic Techniques and Procedures; Female; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Patient Care Team; Pilot Projects; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Research Design; Systems Integration,2-s2.0-84891773905

It can be used to evaluate change in a child’s and/or family’s functioning in paediatric rehabilitation. GAS was first introduced in the United States in mental health care in 1968 (Kiresuk & Sherman, 1968), followed by its introduction in physical rehabilitation in 1983 (Clark & Caudrey, 1983) and in paediatric rehabilitation in 1992 (Palisano, Haley, & Brown, 1992). Since the twenty-first century, there has been renewed interest in its application in the field of paediatric rehabilitation as the demand for tools responsive to clinically important change increases. Outcome measurement using GAS can be applied for all common diagnoses in paediatric rehabilitation. GAS offers the attractive possibility to measure what one intends to measure, because the content of the scales is tailored to the individual circumstances of a child and the family. GAS can be a valuable adjunct when used alongside standardized instruments, and using only standardized measures might preclude the identification of many individual rehabilitation goals attained (Steenbeek, Gorter, Ketelaar, Galama, & Lindeman, 2011). Moreover, measurement of individual goal attainment provides information about the clinical relevance of the outcome in addition to a change score as measured by standardized measures. ? 2015 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,2-s2.0-85054246414

As much as I agree with the intellectual story told in this editorial I present a more skeptical view of the effect of paradigm shifts on healthcare systems on the ground. I argue that ideas triumph when times are ripe and times are ripe in health policy when payers and providers can find a compromise between the need to value what providers do and their professional autonomy. I also argue that autonomy is a product of the market: patients value autonomy and prefer doctors to insurers. ? 2014 by Kerman University of Medical Sciences.,Agents of change; Clinical governance; Paradigm shift; Professional autonomy; Revolution in healthcare; Standardization,,2-s2.0-85002170786

Further, over recent years the incidence of TE in adult cancer patients has increased substantially and development of TE is identified as an independent predictor of poor survival.– A recent prospective study documented 9% of deaths secondary to venous and arterial TE in ambulatory cancer patients receiving chemotherapy. The estimated direct medical care cost of adult TE in the USA is ~$600 million/year.

Methods: Outpatient echocardiography reports at an academic hospital centre were screened and outpatients with LVEF<40% were included. A questionnaire was mailed to the patients’ physician, querying prescription/dosing of ACE-inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) and beta-blockers (BB). Patients with LVEF<30% had additional questions on implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD) referral. Results: Mean age was 69.6+/-12.2 years and mean LVEF was 29.7+/-6.5%. ACEi and/or ARB prescription rate was 260/309(84.1%) versus 256/308(83.1%) for BB (p=NS for comparison). Of patients on ACEi, 77/183(42.1%) were on target dose, compared to 7/45(15.5%) for ARB and 9/254(3.5%) for BB (p<0.01). Of 171/309 patients (55.3%) with LVEF<30%, 72/171(42.1%) had an ICD and 16/171(9.4%) were referred for one. Conclusion: Prescription rates of evidence-based HF medicines are relatively high in outpatients with LVSD referred for echocardiography at this Canadian academic medical centre; however, the proportion of patients at target doses was modest for ACEi and low for ARB and BB. Approximately half of patients who qualify for ICD by EF alone have one or were referred. Important reasons for patients with LVSD not on evidence-based therapy were identified. ?

Our study investigates patients' preferences regarding reducing the time involved in non-palliative radiotherapy care. Methods A total of 142 Dutch patients were included in our study. Using a contingent valuation survey, we measured the proportion of patients who preferred to reduce their patients' time, splitting it into five different categories, and, for those who did, whether and how much they were willing to pay for this to happen. Results About 50% of the patients preferred to reduce their time waiting for admission by 1 week and their travel time by half; 20 and 62% wanted to reduce their waiting time by half and their treatment time from 20 to 5 minutes, respectively; 36% preferred to be treated 7 instead of 5 days a week; and 20% of those wishing to reduce their patients' time were willing to pay, and their mean willingness to pay (WTP) ranged from ?0·32 to ?18·1 per hour's reduction of their time. Conclusion Half of the patients seem to assess their patients' time as reasonable. The other half preferred to reduce it, but only about 20% of them were willing to pay for it to happen and their mean WTP was low. ? ?

Metastatic disease can seed in any bone of the body, but one of the most common long bones affected is the humerus. Although painful and often disabling, metastatic bone disease of the upper extremity often can be treated more conservatively than the lower extremity because of lower weight-bearing demands. However, the surgical management of upper extremity metastatic bone disease is an evolving field, and recent clinical studies have demonstrated several key principles. Intramedullary nailing and whole bone irradiation may be an optimal combination for prophylactic fixation. The addition of polymethyl methacrylate cement adds immediate stabilization to internal fixation and decreases postoperative pain. Plate and screw fixation can be used in lesions that cannot be treated with intramedullary nailing, but caution is necessary to avoid complications related to surgical technique. Finally, periarticular and intraarticular lesions may be managed with a hemi- or total-joint prosthesis for both the shoulder and elbow to provide the maximal functional outcome. Surgical intervention together with appropriate adjunctive therapies can decrease patient-important pain and skeletal-related events while improving quality of life in patients living with metastatic bone disease of the upper extremity. ? 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",Metastatic bone; Surgical management; Upper extremity,bone cement; poly(methyl methacrylate); arm; arthroplasty; Article; bone metastasis; bone plate; bone screw; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; human; intramedullary nailing; open reduction; osteosynthesis; priority journal; prophylactic surgical procedure,2-s2.0-84927947395

Although the intentionto- treat (ITT) analysis is the preferred approach for superiority trials, its role in non-inferiority trials is still under debate. This has led to the use of alternative approaches such as the per-protocol (PP) analysis or the as-treated (AT) analysis, despite the inherent biases of such approaches. Methods: Using simulations, we investigate the effect of 2%, 5% and 10% random and non-random crossovers prior to radiotherapy initiation on the ITT, PP, AT and the combination of ITT and PP analyses with respect to type I error in trials with time-to-event outcomes. We also evaluate bias and SE of the estimates from the ITT, PP and AT approaches. Results: The AT approach had the best performance in terms of type I error, but was anticonservative as non-random crossover increased. The ITT and PP approaches were anticonservative under all percentages of random and non-random crossover. Similarly, lowest bias was seen with the AT approach; however, bias increased as the percentage of non-random crossover increased. The ITT and PP had poor performance in terms of bias as crossovers increased. Conclusions: If minimal crossovers were to occur, we have shown that the AT approach has the lowest type I error rates and smallest opportunity for bias. Results of trials with a high number of crossovers should be interpreted with caution, especially when crossover is non-random. Attempts to prevent crossovers should be maximised.",,Article; breast cancer; cancer recurrence; follow up; human; intention to treat analysis; local recurrence free survival; partial mastectomy; randomized controlled trial (topic); simulation; Breast Neoplasms; computer simulation; crossover procedure; female; intention to treat analysis; randomized controlled trial (topic); statistical bias; statistics; treatment outcome; Bias (Epidemiology); Breast Neoplasms; Computer Simulation; Cross-Over Studies; Female; Humans; Intention to Treat Analysis; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Statistics as Topic; Treatment Outcome,2-s2.0-84911931373

We based our analysis on age-sex-specific patient-level administrative records of diagnoses and treatments. These records include virtually all physician services provided in the province of Ontario, Canada in a 10-year span ending in 2004 and their associated costs. An algorithm is developed to classify services and their costs into three levels of technological intensity. We find that while the overall age-standardized level and cost of services per capita have decreased, the volume and cost of high technologically intensive treatments have increased, especially among older patients.

The most widely used approach is the arterial switch operation (ASO) developed by Jatene in the 1970s. The first set of children who received this intervention are now adults. The objective of this scoping review of the literature was to document the short-term (less than 1 year), medium-term (1-20 years) and long-term (more than 20 years) outcomes in children who underwent the ASO. Our primary income is survival, but we will explore other secondary surgical, cardiovascular, reproductive and quality-of-life outcomes. Methods and analyses: Using a systematic scoping review approach, we will conduct a systematic search of the published literature for experimental and observational studies published on children who received the ASO intervention for classic d-TGA. We will search MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) and Literatura Latino Americana em Ci?ncias da Sa?de (LILACS) from 1973 (date of the first successful ASO) to February 2014. Identified articles will be screened in duplicate and full text for selected articles will be retrieved. Data extraction will be carried out in duplicate. Discrepancies will be resolved by consensus or by consulting a third author. Where possible, proportions will be pooled using the inverse variance method. Our findings will be reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and Meta-analysis Of Observational studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. Ethics and dissemination: The results of this paper will be disseminated as peer-reviewed publications, at conferences and at clinical rounds. Our findings may answer important questions for surgeons who perform the ASO intervention and for clinicians who take care of patients after surgery and throughout their lifespans.

Following Day and Loffler (2009), conflicting contours were created by sampling the orientations of one shape (e.g., a rounded pentagon) with Gabors, and positioning them on the circumference of a different shape (e.g., a circle). In Experiment 1, subjects judged whether the conflicting contour looked more circular than a rounded pentagon of varying amplitude, which allowed us to estimate the perceived shape of the conflicting contour. The relative amount of position and orientation information was manipulated by varying the number of Gabors comprising the target contour. Orientation information dominated the percept for contours sampled with 15-40 elements, producing a strong shape illusion, but position information determined the shape with denser sampling. The magnitude of this orientation dominance effect was equal in younger and older subjects across all sampling levels. In Experiment 2, subjects discriminated five contours that differed in orientation and/or position information. Both groups showed poor discrimination between conflicting contours and their perceptually equivalent radial frequency patterns, confirming the main finding of Experiment 1. In addition, older subjects showed worse discrimination between two noncircular radial frequency patterns than younger subjects. In sum, integration of orientation and position information in shape perception is preserved with aging; however, older adults are less able to make fine shape discriminations between noncircular sampled contours. ? 2014 ARVO.",Aging; Orientation; Position; Shape perception,adult; aged; aging; article; contrast sensitivity; female; human; male; middle aged; orientation; pattern recognition; physiology; position; proprioception; shape perception; visual acuity; young adult; aging; orientation; position; shape perception; Adult; Aged; Aging; Contrast Sensitivity; Female; Form Perception; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Orientation; Proprioception; Visual Acuity; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84901822871

This study examined 61 participants with SAD and 72 with SAD and a comorbid depressive disorder (SAD+D) before and after 12 weeks of cognitive behavioural group therapy (CBGT) for social anxiety. Although patients with SAD+D reported more severe symptoms of social anxiety and depression at pretreatment, treatment was similarly effective for individuals with SAD and SAD+D. However, individuals with SAD+D continued to report higher symptom severity at post-treatment. Interestingly, CBGT for social anxiety also led to improvements in depressive symptoms despite the fact that depression was not targeted during treatment. Improvement in social anxiety symptoms predicted 26.8% of the variance in improvement in depressive symptoms. Results suggest that depressive symptoms need not be in remission for individuals to benefit from CBGT for social anxiety. However, more than 12 sessions of CBGT may be beneficial for individuals with comorbid depression. ?

Methods. - A structured ultrasound hemodialysis access surveillance program was implemented at our institution on March 1, 2010. The access ultrasound comprised the measurement of vessel diameter, velocity, and flow in the feeding artery, anastomosis, and at specific points along the outflow vein (2.5, 5.0, 7.5, and 10 cm beyond anastomosis) along with a waveform pattern in the ipsilateral axillary and internal jugular vein. In this retrospective multicenter study, we compared the frequency of diagnostic contrast fistulograms and endovascular interventions (angioplasty) performed from March 2010 to February 2011 (12 months) by using the implemented ultrasound access surveillance program (postsurveillance) to the preceding 12 month period (March 2009 to February 2010) where no ultrasound access surveillance program was used (pre-surveillance). Results. - Within our hemodialysis program, there was an average of 119 active fistulae during the presurveillance period versus 141 in the postsurveillance period. There were no significant demographic differences in our study populations across the two time frames (p > 0.05). In the presurveillance period, 59 diagnostic contrast fistulograms were performed, whereas 47 diagnostic contrast fistulograms were performed during the post surveillance period. Using a two-sample test for equality of proportions, we found there was a significant decrease in the proportion of diagnostic contrast fistulograms after implementation of an access ultrasound surveillance program (p = 0.0114). Similarly, 81 endovascular interventions were performed during the presurveillance period, whereas a significantly decreased number of endovascular interventions (n = 50) were performed postsurveillance (p < 0.0001). Conclusions. - There was a significant decrease in the number of invasive diagnostic contrast fistulograms and endovascular interventions upon implementation of an ultrasound access surveillance program. Such a structured surveillance program has the potential to provide significant reduction in patient discomfort and to minimize unnecessary invasive endovascular procedures.",,adult; aged; article; blood flow; blood vessel diameter; blood vessel parameters; blood vessel velocity; cannulation; clinical examination; endovascular surgery; health program; hemodialysis; human; internal jugular vein; major clinical study; priority journal; retrospective study; structured duplex ultrasound hemodialysis access surveillance program; vascular access; vein diameter,2-s2.0-84899533460

The activity in blood samples from the patients, necessary to provide an estimate of the input function for quantitative analysis, was measured both using a thyroid probe and using a well counter. Three calibration techniques were compared: single-point calibration using a standard solution for the thyroid probe (ProbePoint technique), single-point calibration using a standard solution for the well counter (Well-Point technique), and multiple-point calibration over the full range of expected blood activities for the well counter (Well-Curve technique). The WellCurve method was assumed to provide the most accurate estimate of blood activity. The precision of measuring blood volume using a micropipette was also evaluated by obtaining multiple blood samples. Simplified-kineticanalysis multiple-time-point (SKA-M) uptake rates for the primary tumor were calculated for all 35 patients using PET images and each of the 3 methods for assessing blood concentration. Results: Errors in blood activity measurements ranging from -9.5% to 7.6% were found using the ProbePoint method, whereas the error range was much less (from -1.3% to 0.9%) for the WellPoint method. The precision in blood volume measurements ranged from -6% to 12%in the 10 patients assessed. The errors in blood activity and volume measurements were reflected in the SKA-M measurements in the same range. Conclusion: The WellPoint method provides a compromise between accuracy and clinical practicality. Random errors in both blood activity and volume measurements accumulate and may compromise parameters-such as the SKA-M estimate of tumor uptake rate-that depend not only on images but also on blood concentration data. ? 2014 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, Inc.",Blood activity; Dynamic PET; Micro-pipette; Thyroid probe; Well counter,"antineoplastic agent; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; diagnostic agent; fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; article; blood sampling; blood volume; calibration; cancer chemotherapy; cancer radiotherapy; clinical article; drug blood level; drug tumor level; head and neck cancer; human; image analysis; measurement accuracy; measurement error; micropipette; PET scanner; positron emission tomography; quantitative analysis; random error; uncertainty; blood; blood activity; dynamic PET; head and neck tumor; image processing; methodology; micro-pipette; scintiscanning; thyroid probe; uncertainty; well counter; blood activity; dynamic PET; micro-pipette; thyroid probe; well counter; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Positron-Emission Tomography; Uncertainty",2-s2.0-84898889620
