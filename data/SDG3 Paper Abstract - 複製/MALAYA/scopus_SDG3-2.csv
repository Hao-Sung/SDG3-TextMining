The association between FT and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was also investigated. Methods: A total of 429 respondents diagnosed with urologic cancers (prostate cancer, bladder and renal cancer) from Sarawak General Hospital and Subang Jaya Medical Centre in Malaysia were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. Objective and subjective FT were measured by catastrophic health expenditure (healthcare-cost-to-income ratio greater than 40%) and the Personal Financial Well-being Scale, respectively. HRQoL was measured with the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy – General 7 Items scale. Results: Objective and subjective FT were experienced by 16.1 and 47.3% of the respondents, respectively. Respondents who sought treatment at a private hospital and had out-of-pocket health expenditures were more likely to experience objective FT, after adjustment for covariates. Respondents who were female and had a monthly household income less than MYR 5000 were more likely to experience average to high subjective FT. Greater objective FT (OR = 2.75, 95% CI 1.09–6.95) and subjective FT (OR = 4.68, 95% CI 2.63–8.30) were associated with poor HRQoL. Conclusions: The significant association between both objective and subjective FT and HRQoL highlights the importance of reducing FT among urologic cancer patients. Subjective FT was found to have a greater negative impact on HRQoL. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Financial burden; Financial distress; Financial toxicity; Health-related quality of life; Malaysia; Urologic cancers,antineoplastic agent; hormone; aged; Article; bladder cancer; cancer hormone therapy; cancer palliative therapy; cancer patient; cross-sectional study; female; financial deficit; Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy; general hospital; health care cost; household income; human; kidney cancer; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle income country; prevalence; priority journal; private hospital; prospective study; prostate cancer; public hospital; quality of life; structured questionnaire; tertiary care center; urinary tract cancer,2-s2.0-85069660985

Obesity can impact hormonal factors, which have been hypothesized to play a role in these cancers. We investigated anthropometric and reproductive factors in relation to esophageal and gastric cancer by subtype and subsite for 476,160 participants from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort. Multivariable hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox models. During a mean follow-up of 14 years, 220 esophageal adenocarcinomas (EA), 195 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, 243 gastric cardia (GC) and 373 gastric noncardia (GNC) cancers were diagnosed. Body mass index (BMI) was associated with EA in men (BMI ?30 vs. 18.5–25 kg/m2: HR = 1.94, 95% CI: 1.25–3.03) and women (HR = 2.66, 95% CI: 1.15–6.19); however, adjustment for waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) attenuated these associations. After mutual adjustment for BMI and HC, respectively, WHR and waist circumference (WC) were associated with EA in men (HR = 3.47, 95% CI: 1.99–6.06 for WHR &gt;0.96 vs. &lt;0.91; HR = 2.67, 95% CI: 1.52–4.72 for WC &gt;98 vs. &lt;90 cm) and women (HR = 4.40, 95% CI: 1.35–14.33 for WHR &gt;0.82 vs. &lt;0.76; HR = 5.67, 95% CI: 1.76–18.26 for WC &gt;84 vs. &lt;74 cm). WHR was also positively associated with GC in women, and WC was positively associated with GC in men. Inverse associations were observed between parity and EA (HR = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.14–0.99; &gt;2 vs. 0) and age at first pregnancy and GNC (HR = 0.54, 95% CI: 0.32–0.91; &gt;26 vs. &lt;22 years); whereas bilateral ovariectomy was positively associated with GNC (HR = 1.87, 95% CI: 1.04–3.36). These findings support a role for hormonal pathways in upper gastrointestinal cancers. ? 2019 The Authors.

In achieving human thermal comfort and healthy indoor environment in a large building, there are many types of air conditioning systems that can be used, including the multi - split type unit and the variable refrigerant flow (VRF) system. The present research analyses the annual energy use of the existing ACMV system (multi - split type ceiling cassette unit) installed in the examined building, which located in the tropical area and compares it with a VRF system. The TRNSYS software is used to simulate both of these systems in accordance with the existing building’s characteristics and its operation. The existing building’s characteristics and its operation are obtained by conducting the site survey and field measurements in the building. In the current paper, the bin method is used to estimate the annual energy consumption for these systems. Based on the simulation results, the existing ACMV system consumes more energy in comparison to the VRF system by 13.62%. In addition, the annual operating cost of these systems has shown that the VRF system has a lower annual operating cost in comparison to the existing ACMV system by 13.63%. Besides that, the VRF system can accommodate an estimated payback period of around 6.6?years and an internal rate of return of 12.75%. The result has suggested that the VRF system has a great potential in energy savings and could reduce the electricity consumption in a large building significantly. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,Air conditioning; Earnings; Energy conservation; Investments; Office buildings; Operating costs; Refrigerants; Thermal comfort; Tropics; Annual energy consumption; Annual operating costs; Commercial building; Electricity-consumption; Field measurement; Healthy indoor environments; Human thermal comfort; Internal rate of return; Energy utilization,2-s2.0-85072070516

Currently, only two drugs are approved for youth-onset type 2 diabetes and many patients are not meeting glycemic targets. Clearly, there is an urgent need to complete clinical trials in youths with type 2 diabetes to increase the therapeutic choice for these patients. However, factors such as limited patient numbers, unwillingness of patients to participate in trials, failure to meet strict inclusion and exclusion criteria, and poor clinic attendance have limited the size and number of trials in this complicated patient demographic. Recommendations: This is a narrative opinion piece on the design of clinical trials in youth-onset type 2 diabetes prepared by researchers who undertake this type of study in different countries. The review addresses possible ways to enhance trial designs in youth-onset type 2 diabetes to meet regulatory requirements, while minimizing the barriers to patients’ participation. The definition of adolescence, recruitment of sufficient patient numbers, increasing flexibility in selection criteria, improving convenience of trial visits, requirements of a control group, possible endpoints, and trial compliance are all considered. The authors recommend allowing extrapolation from adult data, using multiple interventional arms within future trials, broadening inclusion criteria, and focusing on endpoints beyond glucose control, among others, in order to improve the successful completion of more trials in this population. Conclusions: Improvements in trial design will enable better recruitment and retention and thereby more evidence for treatment outcomes for youth-onset type 2 diabetes. ?

This study aimed to explore parents’ reasons for refusal of childhood vaccinations in Malaysia and their recommendations on addressing their concerns. Methods: A qualitative study design involving individual both face-to-face and online in-depth interview was used. The topic guide was developed from the Health Belief Model theoretical framework. Seven face-to-face and seven online interviews were conducted with parents in the Klang Valley (an urban area) who had refused childhood vaccination. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and checked. Thematic approach was used to analyze the data. Data was collected until data saturation was reached. Results: Findings were summarized into two main categories: Personal Health Beliefs and Vaccine Related Concerns. Six personal health beliefs were identified: lack of confidence in modern medicine and health care personnel, pharmaceutical conspiracy to sell medicines, preference to a natural approach to health, personal instincts, religious beliefs and having a partner with similar beliefs. Four main vaccine-related concerns were identified: negative effects and content concerns, doubts of necessity and lack of information and knowledge regarding vaccines. Parents recommended that more empathy from healthcare professionals and evidence on safety and content purity would help them reconsider vaccination. Conclusion: Parents had multiple reasons for refusing childhood vaccinations but felt that communication and empathy from healthcare professionals was lacking. Besides individual consultations with parents, addressing these concerns at multiple levels in the health care system and society may help to increase the uptake of childhood vaccinations in the future. ? 2020 The Authors",Primary health care; Treatment refusal; Vaccines,adult; Article; child; comprehension; conceptual framework; empathy; female; health belief; Health Belief Model; health care personnel; human; interview; knowledge; Malaysia; male; parental attitude; patient safety; priority journal; qualitative research; religion; urban area; vaccination; vaccination refusal,2-s2.0-85070701051

To date there is no specific laboratory diagnostic test for severe dengue. This qualitative study explored expert views regarding current issues in diagnosing severe dengue, rationale for severe dengue-specific diagnostics, future prospects and features of potential diagnostics for severe dengue. Methods: In-depth individual interviews with thematic saturation were conducted between May and July 2018. The data was analyzed using thematic analysis. Results: Based on expert opinion, diagnosis of severe dengue is challenging as it depends on astute clinical interpretation of non-dengue-specific clinical and laboratory findings. A specific test that detects impending manifestation of severe dengue could 1) overcome failure in identifying severe disease for referral or admission, 2) facilitate timely and appropriate management of plasma leakage and bleeding, 3) overcome the lack of clinical expertise and laboratory diagnosis in rural health settings. The most important feature of any diagnostics for severe dengue is the point-of-care (POC) format where it can be performed at or near the bedside. Conclusion: The development of diagnostics to detect impending severe dengue is warranted to reduce the morbidity and mortality rates of dengue infection and it should be prioritized. ? 2020 The Authors",Challenges; DENV; Diagnostics; Severe dengue,immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; nonstructural protein 1; Article; bleeding; diagnostic test; human; interview; laboratory diagnosis; nonhuman; pilot study; priority journal; qualitative research; rural health; severe dengue; thematic analysis,2-s2.0-85070310416

Circulating concentrations of estradiol, testosterone, their free fractions and sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG), were examined in 430 incident BC cases and 645 matched controls among alcohol-consuming postmenopausal women nested within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. Mediation analysis was applied to assess whether individual hormone levels mediated the relationship between alcohol intake and BC risk. An alcohol-related hormonal signature, obtained by partial least square (PLS) regression, was evaluated as a potential mediator. Total (TE), natural direct and natural indirect effects (NIE) were estimated. Alcohol intake was positively associated with overall BC risk and specifically with estrogen receptor-positive tumors with respectively TE = 1.17(95%CI: 1.01,1.35) and 1.36(1.08,1.70) for a 1-standard deviation (1-SD) increase of intake. There was no evidence of mediation by sex steroids or SHBG separately except for a weak indirect effect through free estradiol where NIE = 1.03(1.00,1.06). However, an alcohol-related hormonal signature negatively associated with SHBG and positively with estradiol and testosterone was associated with BC risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.25 [1.07,1.47]) for a 1-SD higher PLS score, and had a statistically significant NIE accounting for a mediated proportion of 24%. There was limited evidence of mediation of the alcohol-BC association by individual sex hormones. However, a hormonal signature, reflecting lower levels of SHBG and higher levels of sex steroids, mediated a substantial proportion of the association. ? 2019 UICC",alcohol; breast cancer; EPIC; hormonal signature; mediation analysis; sex steroids,estradiol; sex hormone; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; estradiol; sex hormone binding globulin; testosterone; adult; aged; alcohol consumption; Article; breast cancer; cancer risk; case control study; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease association; female; human; major clinical study; postmenopause; priority journal; prospective study; risk factor; trend study; adverse event; blood; breast tumor; clinical trial; drinking behavior; incidence; middle aged; multicenter study; postmenopause; Aged; Alcohol Drinking; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Estradiol; Female; Humans; Incidence; Middle Aged; Postmenopause; Prospective Studies; Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin; Testosterone,2-s2.0-85065193053

Methods: This was a prospective, randomised controlled trial. We recruited diabetic patients aged?>?18?years, American Society of Anesthesiologists class II–III, who were scheduled for unilateral diabetic foot surgery below the knee. All patients were assessed for autonomic dysfunction using the Survey of Autonomic Symptoms score. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either PNB or SAB for the surgery. Hemodynamic data, including usage of vasopressors, were recorded at 5-min intervals for up to 1 h after the induction of anesthesia. Pain scores were recorded postoperatively, and follow-up was done via telephone 6?months later. Results: Compared to the PNB group, the SAB group had a larger number of patients with significant hypotension (14 vs. 1; p?=?0.001) and more patients who required vasopressor boluses (6 vs. 0 patients). Compared to SAB group, the patients in the PNB group had a longer postoperative pain-free duration (9 vs. 4.54?h; p?=?0.002) and lower pain scores 1?day after surgery (3.63 vs. 4.69; p?=?0.01). Conclusion: Peripheral nerve block should be considered, whenever possible, as the first option of anesthesia for lower limb surgery in diabetic patients as it provides hemodynamic stability and superior postoperative pain control compared to SAB.

In Malaysia, the government took the step to address this concern in 2005 through the introduction of Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT) to treat opioid use disorders. The purpose of this study is to test whether help-seeking attitudes by MMT patients are associated with continued substance use. Method: Participants were 171 patients who received MMT in 2 of the National Anti-Drug Agencies in Klang Valley, Malaysia. Participants were, on average, 45.35 years old (SD = 10.22) and approximately half of them were married. Participants’ Help Seeking Attitudes were measured using the 10-Item Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help–Short Form (ATSPPH-SF) (Fischer and Farina 1995). The dependent measure for this analysis was whether or not the participant had a positive drug screen in the past 6 months of their MMT. Results: Frequencies indicate that 46.2% of the participants had positive drug screen results indicating illicit drug use during the past 6 months of MMT treatment. Logistic regression results indicate that more positive Help Seeking Attitudes are associated with reduced odds of a positive drug screen (O.R. =.87, 95% CI =.80,.93, p <.001). Participant perceptions that help-seeking is positive reduced the odds of having a positive drug screen. Conclusions: This result suggests that research, practice, and policy efforts might include messages that aim to promote help-seeking and to reduce stigma associated with seeking help for substance use disorders. ? 2019, ? 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",help seeking attitudes; Malaysia; Methadone maintenance,,2-s2.0-85066845490

Persistent pollutants that contain PFAAs have been associated with adverse health effects in humans, and many studies have documented dietary intake, indoor air inhalation, and dermal contact as the potential routes for human exposure to PFAAs. The aim of this study was to assess the level of PFAAs in the serum samples of a general population in a specific region in Malaysia. Using 219 serum samples collected from residents of Klang Valley, Malaysia, the levels of nine PFAAs were analyzed using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, questionnaire surveys on the dietary habits and lifestyles of the subjects were conducted. The results showed that PFAA concentrations of up to 32.57 ng/mL were detected in all serum samples. In 82.6% of the participants, at least seven PFAAs were detected in the serum samples, with perfluorooctanesulfonic acid being the predominant PFAA (median = 8.79 ng/mL). In the adjusted regression model, the concentrations of most PFAAs were higher in men than in women and positively correlated with age, although body mass index and smoking were not significantly associated with the serum PFAA concentrations. Taking into consideration the lifestyle variables, significant associations were found between nonstick cookware and perfluorononanoic acid, between dental floss and cosmetics and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and between leather sofa and perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Besides, consumption of beef was significantly associated with increased levels of serum PFUnDA, whereas consumption of lamb and chicken eggs was negatively associated with the serum levels of PFUnDA and PFDA, respectively. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH",Biomonitoring; Dietary exposure; Malaysia; Perfluoroalkyl acids; Serum,,2-s2.0-85072261837

As a result of their persistent and toxic properties, heavy metals need to be removed from contaminated environments using an efficient technology. This study is aimed to determine the heavy metals’ (Ni, Pb, and Zn) bioremoval capacity of consortia of filamentous fungi from landfill leachate-contaminated soil. Materials and methods: Three different groups of consortia of fungi, namely all isolated fungi, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota, were employed for the bioremediation of the contaminated soil. A total of thirteen fungal species were used to make up the three consortia. The setup was kept for 100?days during which regular watering was carried out. Soil subsamples were collected at day 20, day 60, and 100 for monitoring of heavy metal concentration, fungal growth, and other physicochemical parameters. Results and discussion: Highest tolerance index of 1.0 was recorded towards Ni and Zn concentrations. The maximum metal bioremoval efficiency was observed for soil bioaugmented with the all isolated fungi for Ni and Pb with the removal efficiencies as 52% and 44% respectively. However, 36% was realized as the maximum removal for Zn, and was for Ascomycota consortium-treated soil. The order for the heavy metal removal for Ni and Pb is all isolated fungi &gt; Basidiomycota &gt; Ascomycota, while for Zn is Basidiomycota &gt; all isolated fungi &gt; Ascomycota. Spectra analysis revealed the presence of peaks (1485–1445?cm?1) only in the consortia-treated soil which corresponded to the bending of the C–H bond which signifies the presence of methylene group. Conclusions: Soil treated using bioaugmentation had the best heavy metal removal as compared to that of the control. This suggests the contribution of fungal bioaugmentation in the decontamination of heavy metal–contaminated soil. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bioaugmentation; Consortia; Contamination; Fungi; Heavy metals; Soil,bioaugmentation; bioremediation; contaminated land; environmental protection; fungus; heavy metal; landfill; public health; soil pollution; toxicity; Ascomycota; Basidiomycota; Fungi,2-s2.0-85069965457

These neoteric functionalizing agents have been reported to improve the dispersibility and biocompatibility of graphene in the cellular environment. DES-functionalized graphene also has significantly greater tamoxifen (TAM)-loading capacity than non-functionalized graphene. Therefore, this study investigated the anti-cancer properties of TAM-loaded graphene against cancerous cells. TAM-loaded, DES-functionalized graphene showed a significant increase in anti-cancer activity, especially in the case of DES ChCl:fructose (2:1), as validated by cell viability, reactive oxygen species, and cell cycle progression assays. The cytotoxicity profile of TAM-loaded graphene against cancerous cells was confirmed by real-time cell growth analysis. Across all tested cellular kinetic models, the most significant reduction in the growth rate constant of cancerous cells was obtained using graphene functionalized with DES ChCl:fructose (2:1). All told, DES-functionalized graphene demonstrated improved anti-cancer activity compared to non-functionalized graphene. ? 2019, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.",Drug delivery; Ionic liquid; Nanomedicine; Nanotechnology; Reactive oxygen species; Superoxide ion,,2-s2.0-85069471155

However, there is still a lack of awareness about early screening. Mortality rates have not yet reduced, and finding a way to lower them has become imperative. Attention must be paid to early-stage diagnosis of lung cancer in particular as the survival period has been extended. Over the years, screening modalities such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography scans (CT-scans), ultrasound machines, and positron emission tomography (PET) have been extensively employed; however, these techniques have some drawbacks, such as expense and the fact that they contain radioactive substances. Recently, sensor synchronizing in analysis is being used in early-stage screening due to its simplicity, portability, low cost, and ease of use. Biosensors have become the standard tools for cancer diagnosis in terms of medical application, and advanced development of sensors has been achieved. This review concisely outlines the research conducted into the application of biosensors on lung cancer. It concludes that the best and most used biosensor for early-phase lung cancer diagnosis is the electrochemical biosensor, which has been designed to bring significant benefits in portability, simplicity, reliability, non-invasiveness, cost-effectiveness, detection limit, sensitivity, and diagnostic specificity. Likewise, the attachment concerning towards the biorecognition element is much more considerable and substantial. ? Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",,,2-s2.0-85067686727

Methods: Study subjects included men with initial PSA between 4.0 and 10.0 ng/ml that have undergone 12-core TRUS-guided prostate biopsy between 2009 and 2016. The prostate cancer detection rate was calculated, while potential factors associated with detection were investigated via univariable and multivariable analysis. Results: A total of 617 men from a multi-ethnic background encompassing Chinese (63.5%), Malay (23.1%) and Indian (13.3%) were studied. The overall cancer detection rate was 14.3% (88/617), which included cancers detected at biopsy 1 (first biopsy), biopsy 2 (second biopsy with previous negative biopsy) and biopsy ? 3 (third or more biopsies with prior negative biopsies). Indian men displayed higher detection rate (23.2%) and increased risk of prostate cancer development (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03–3.32, p < 0.05), compared to their Malay (9.8%) and Chinese (14.0%) counterparts. Multivariable analysis revealed that ethnicity and PSA density (PSAD) are independent factors associated with overall prostate cancer detection rate. A unit increase of PSAD reflected an increase in PSA after controlling for prostate volume. Conclusion: Prostate cancer detection in Malaysia is comparatively lower. Our study suggests that ethnicity and PSA density should be considered when recommending first or repeat TRUS-guided prostate biopsy for prostate cancer detection in a multi-ethnic Malaysian population. ? 2019",Prostate cancer; Prostate specific antigen (PSA); Prostate volume; Transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-Guided biopsy,,2-s2.0-85063893015

Geometric means of protein concentrations were estimated using analysis of variance, adjusted for relevant covariates. Older age was associated with higher concentrations of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 and lower concentrations of IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3. Higher body mass index was associated with lower concentrations of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2. Taller height was associated with higher concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and lower concentrations of IGFBP-1. Smokers had higher concentrations of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2 and lower concentrations of IGFBP-3 than nonsmokers. Higher alcohol consumption was associated with higher concentrations of IGF-II and lower concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-2. African Americans had lower concentrations of IGF-II, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-3 and Hispanics had lower IGF-I, IGF-II and IGFBP-3 than non-Hispanic whites. These findings indicate that a range of anthropometric, behavioural and sociodemographic factors are associated with circulating concentrations of IGFs and IGFBPs in men, which will lead to a greater understanding of the mechanisms through which these factors influence cancer risk. ? 2019 The Authors.

Data came from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS), conducted in 2005, 2008, and 2011. The males, those who were educated, the young-old (aged between 65 and 74 years), urban dwellers, and living in institutions were more likely to participate in all three activities frequently. Frequent or occasional participation in these three activities was negatively associated with feelings of loneliness. The longitudinal study from 2005 to 2011 showed that respondents who frequently played cards/mahjong at baseline were less likely to feel persistent loneliness at the end of the 2011 wave. Instead, frequently watching TV/listening to the radio in 2008 was associated with lower odds in feeling persistent loneliness at the end of 2011. Hence, active participation in playing cards/mahjong and TV/radio entertainment can be effective treatment intervention against persistent loneliness among older Chinese. For the Chinese, a leisure activity steeped in a nation's culture and heritage, such as playing mahjong, may be used as an intervention strategy to prevent and alleviate chronic loneliness among older adults. ? 2019 The Authors",China; Loneliness; Mahjong; Older adults,aged; article; China; human; human experiment; inheritance; loneliness; longevity; longitudinal study; male,2-s2.0-85072159163

Among 100 types of HPV, 14 types are considered to cause the risky cancer. The gene HPV-16 E7 is responsible for the development of cancer with the infected women. Earlier identification of this gene sequence avoids the cancer progression. The targeted HPV-16 E7 sequence was sandwiched by capture and reporter sequences on the carbodiimidazole-modified interdigitated electrode (IDE) surface. Target sequence at 100 f. was paired to the capture sequence immobilized on IDE sensing surface. To this surface, different concentrations of reporter sequence with and without gold rod (GNR) were evaluated. In both cases the detections were attained 1 aM by the reporter sequence pairing and with GNR increments in current were found. This enhancement was found to be 1000 folds, considering the condition was revealed in the absence of reporter. This sandwich detection strategy of capture-target-reporter sequences for HPV-16 detection on the IDE sensing surface helps to diagnose the association of cervical cancer. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Dielectric sensor; Gold nanorod; Human papilloma virus; Women cancer,gold nanorod; virus DNA; Article; controlled study; DNA determination; E7 gene; Human papillomavirus type 16; nonhuman; papillomavirus infection; sensitivity and specificity; sequence analysis; surface property; uterine cervix cancer; virus gene,2-s2.0-85071992063

In some FA genes, monoallelic mutations have been found to be associated with breast cancer risk, while the risk associations of others remain unknown. The gene for FA type C, FANCC, has been proposed as a breast cancer susceptibility gene based on epidemiological and sequencing studies. We used the Oncoarray project to genotype two truncating FANCC variants (p.R185X and p.R548X) in 64,760 breast cancer cases and 49,793 controls of European descent. FANCC mutations were observed in 25 cases (14 with p.R185X, 11 with p.R548X) and 26 controls (18 with p.R185X, 8 with p.R548X). There was no evidence of an association with the risk of breast cancer, neither overall (odds ratio 0.77, 95%CI 0.44–1.33, p = 0.4) nor by histology, hormone receptor status, age or family history. We conclude that the breast cancer risk association of these two FANCC variants, if any, is much smaller than for BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 mutations. If this applies to all truncating variants in FANCC it would suggest there are differences between FA genes in their roles on breast cancer risk and demonstrates the merit of large consortia for clarifying risk associations of rare variants. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85071631153

The pathogen is known for its ability to form biofilm that confers protection against harsh environmental condition and as part of the colonisation process during infection. Coaggregation is a process that facilitates the formation of biofilm. In a preliminary in vitro study, high coaggregation index and biofilm production were found between V. cholerae with human commensals namely Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae. Building upon these results, the effects of coaggregation were further evaluated using adult BALB/c mouse model. The animal study showed no significant differences in mortality and fluid accumulation ratio between treatment groups infected with V. cholerae alone and those infected with coaggregation partnership (V. cholerae with E. coli or V. cholerae with E. cloacae). However, mild inflammation was detected in both partnering pairs. Higher density of V. cholerae was recovered from faecal samples of mice co-infected with E. coli and V. cholerae in comparison with other groups at 24?h post-infection. This partnership also elicited slightly higher levels of interleukin-5 (IL-5) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). Nonetheless, the involvement of autoinducer-2 (AI-2) as the signalling molecules in quorum sensing system is not evident in this study. Since E. coli is one of the common commensals, our result may suggest the involvement of commensals in cholera development. ? 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Adult mouse model; Coaggregation; Human commensal; Vibrio cholerae,interleukin 10; interleukin 5; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bacterial colonization; bacterial count; bacterial virulence; Bagg albino mouse; bioaccumulation; biofilm; cholera; commensal Escherichia coli; controlled study; disease severity; Enterobacter cloacae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; Escherichia coli infection; feces microflora; female; in vitro study; inflammation; microbial activity; mixed infection; mortality; mouse; nonhuman; pathophysiology; priority journal; quorum sensing; signal transduction; Vibrio cholerae,2-s2.0-85070731239

This retrospective study evaluated the dose exposure and organ cancer risk in paediatric patients who underwent CT thorax-abdomen-pelvis (CT TAP) between January 2016 and December 2018. The records of 34 boys and 39 girls (n = 73) were retrieved and divided into three age groups (0–4, 5–9 and 10–12) — the standard protocol for helical scanning setup at 100 kV and 210 mAs. Generally, the CT dose index volume, dose length product and effective dose increased in tandem with the children's age due to higher body mass index. From the youngest to the oldest age group, the liver had the highest cancer risk, especially for boys, which was most likely due to its anatomical location in the scan area. However, from age 5 and above, steep increments were observed in the risk for ovaries, whereas testicles had none. Thus, it is recommended to take precautions when subjecting children to CT TAP, especially prepubescent girls, whose ovaries exposed to almost a thousand times cancer risk per 100,000 procedure. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Cancer risk; CT TAP; Effective dose; Paediatric,Diseases; Pediatrics; Risk perception; Anatomical locations; Body mass index; Cancer risk; Dose-length products; Effective dose; Helical scanning; Imaging modality; Standard protocols; Computerized tomography; abdominal radiography; Article; body mass; cancer risk; child; childhood cancer; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; effective dose (radiation); female; groups by age; human; infant; liver cancer; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medical record review; newborn; ovary cancer; pediatric patient; pelvis radiography; prepuberty; preschool child; radiation exposure; retrospective study; school child; sex difference; stomach cancer; testis cancer; thorax radiography; thyroid cancer,2-s2.0-85070321705

Continuous monitoring of BTEX in Kuala Lumpur City Centre, Kuala Terengganu, Kota Kinabalu and Fraser Hill were conducted using Online Gas Chromatograph. For comparison, BTEX at selected hotspot locations were determined by active sampling method using sorbent tubes and Thermal Desorption Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry. The hazard quotient (HQ) for non-carcinogenic and the life-time cancer risk (LTCR) of BTEX were calculated using the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) health risk assessment (HRA) methods. The results showed that the highest total BTEX concentrations using continuous monitoring were recorded in the Kuala Lumpur City Centre (49.56 ± 23.71 μg/m3). Toluene was the most dominant among the BTEX compounds. The average concentrations of benzene ranged from 0.69 ± 0.45 μg/m3 to 6.20 ± 3.51 μg/m3. Measurements using active sampling showed that BTEX concentrations dominated at the roadside (193.11 ± 114.57 μg/m3) in comparison to petrol station (73.08 ± 30.41 μg/m3), petrochemical industry (32.10 ± 13.13 μg/m3) and airport (25.30 ± 6.17 μg/m3).

Here, we show that a Staphylococcus aureus peptide, homologous to an immunodominant MPO T-cell epitope (MPO409–428), can induce anti-MPO autoimmunity. The peptide (6PGD391–410) is part of a plasmid-encoded 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase found in some S. aureus strains. It induces anti-MPO T-cell autoimmunity and MPO-ANCA in mice, whereas related sequences do not. Mice immunized with 6PGD391–410, or with S. aureus containing a plasmid expressing 6PGD391–410, develop glomerulonephritis when MPO is deposited in glomeruli. The peptide induces anti-MPO autoreactivity in the context of three MHC class II allomorphs. Furthermore, we show that 6PGD391–410 is immunogenic in humans, as healthy human and AAV patient sera contain anti-6PGD and anti-6PGD391–410 antibodies. Therefore, our results support the idea that bacterial plasmids might have a function in autoimmune disease. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,"cytokine; gamma interferon; interleukin 17; interleukin 6; major histocompatibility antigen class 2; myeloperoxidase; myeloperoxidase inhibitor; nephritogenic antigen; peptide; phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; polyclonal antibody; recombinant protein; tumor necrosis factor; bacterial protein; epitope; nephritogenic antigen; peptide; peroxidase; antibody; bacterium; enzyme; immunity; induced response; peptide; plasmid; albuminuria; amino acid sequence; ANCA associated vasculitis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antibody detection; antibody response; Article; autoimmunity; bacterial load; bacterial strain; Bacteroides; CD4 lymphocyte count; CD8 lymphocyte count; cell proliferation assay; clinical article; controlled study; electroporation; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; enzyme linked immunospot assay; flow cytometry; glomerulonephritis; high performance liquid chromatography; human; hybridoma; immune response; immunization; immunofluorescence test; immunogenicity; male; mouse; neutrophil; nonhuman; plasmid; protein expression; protein purification; sequence homology; Staphylococcus aureus; animal; Bagg albino mouse; blood; C57BL mouse; genetics; glomerulonephritis; immunology; knockout mouse; metabolism; physiology; plasmid; transgenic mouse; Bacteria (microorganisms); Mus; Staphylococcus aureus; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Anti-Neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibody-Associated Vasculitis; Autoimmunity; Bacterial Proteins; Epitopes, T-Lymphocyte; Glomerulonephritis; Heymann Nephritis Antigenic Complex; Humans; Male; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Transgenic; Peptides; Peroxidase; Plasmids; Staphylococcus aureus",2-s2.0-85069908713

Genetic analysis has shown that the parasites are divided into three subpopulations according to their geographic origin (Peninsular or Borneo) and, in Borneo, their macaque host (Macaca fascicularis or M. nemestrina). Whilst evidence suggests that genetic exchange events have occurred between the two Borneo subpopulations, the picture is unclear in less studied Peninsular strains. One difficulty is that P. knowlesi infected individuals tend to present with low parasitaemia leading to samples with insufficient DNA for whole genome sequencing. Here, using a parasite selective whole genome amplification approach on unprocessed blood samples, we were able to analyse recent genomes sourced from both Peninsular Malaysia and Borneo. The analysis provides evidence that recombination events are present in the Peninsular Malaysia parasite subpopulation, which have acquired fragments of the M. nemestrina associated subpopulation genotype, including the DBPβ and NBPXa erythrocyte invasion genes. The NBPXb invasion gene has also been exchanged within the macaque host-associated subpopulations of Malaysian Borneo. Our work provides strong evidence that exchange events are far more ubiquitous than expected and should be taken into consideration when studying the highly complex P. knowlesi population structure. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85068806861

We will systematically scope the literature to identify existing strategies (definitions/questionnaires/diagnostics/outcomes) used in surveys of CRDs in adults in low-resource settings. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI WoS, Global Health and WHO Global Health Library [search terms: prevalence AND CRD (COPD, asthma) AND LMICs, from 1995], and two reviewers will independently extract data from selected studies onto a piloted customised data extraction form. We will convene a workshop of the multidisciplinary 4CCORD research team with representatives from the RESPIRE partners (Bangladesh, India, Malaysia, Pakistan and Edinburgh) at which the findings of the scoping review will be presented, discussed and interpreted. The findings will inform a future RESPIRE 4CCORD study, which will estimate CRD burden in adults in Asian LMICs. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,asthma; chronic respiratory tract disease; global health; health care; health care policy; human; low income country; middle income country; Review; risk factor; systematic review,2-s2.0-85065580453

We collected data on anthropometric and questionnaire-measured sleep parameters in 2007–2008. 516 participants returned for examinations in 2013–2015. General obesity was defined as body mass index (BMI) ?age- and sex-specific 95 th percentile or ?25 kg/m 2 for participants aged &lt;18 or ?18 years, respectively. Central obesity was defined as waist circumference (WC) ? age- and sex-specific 90 th percentile or using adult cut-offs. After a mean follow-up of 6.2 ± 0.5 years, the mean BMI increased from 18.5 ± 3.1 to 20.9 ± 3.4 kg/m 2 . The corresponding WC were 63.7 ± 8.9 and 69.8 ± 9.7 cm. General obesity rate increased from 8.3% (95% confidence interval [CI] 6.1–11.1) to 11.3% (8.7–14.4; p = 0.034). Central obesity rate decreased from 16.9% (13.7–20.4) to 13.5% (10.6–16.8; p = 0.034). During follow-up, more participants reported short sleep (&lt;7 hours/day during weekday: 20.5% [17.1–24.2] vs. 15.3% [12.3–18.8]; p = 0.033) and bedtime after midnight (60.5% [56.2–64.8] vs. 16.2% [13.1–19.7]; p &lt; 0.001) than baseline. The relative risk of overweight/obesity in participants with short sleep and late bedtime was 1.30 (0.48–3.47) and 1.46 (0.70–3.05), respectively.

The exact mechanism by which Dis acts against CRC however, still remains unclear, hence in this study, we investigated the possible molecular mechanisms of Dis in CRC cell line, HCT-116. Here, we monitored the viability of HCT-116 cells in the presence of Dis and investigated the underlying mechanism of Dis against HCT-116 cells at the gene and protein levels using NanoString and proteome profiler array technologies. Findings demonstrated that Dis exhibits greater cytotoxic effects towards HCT-116 CRC cells (IC50 = 3.58 ± 0.58 ?g/ml) as compared to the normal colon CCD-841 cells (IC50 = 51.95 ± 0.11 ?g/ml). Arrests of the cells in G2/M phase confirms the occurrence of mitotic disruption via Dis. Activation of apoptosis factors such as Fas and Bax at the gene and protein levels along with the release of Cytochrome C from mitochondria and cleavage of Caspase cascades indicate the presence of turbulence as a result of apoptosis induction in Dis-treated cells. Moreover, NF-?B translocation was inhibited in Dis-treated cells. Our results indicate that Dis can target HCT-116 cells through the mitotic disruption and apoptosis induction. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85063499960

The use of CAM could influence adherence to evidence-based (E-B) medicine. We explored the views of carers of Malaysian children with asthma regarding the use of CAM for childhood asthma, and its relationship with self-reported adherence to E-B medicine. We used a screening questionnaire to identify children diagnosed with asthma from seven suburban primary schools in Malaysia. Informed consent was obtained prior to the interviews. We conducted the interviews using a semi-structured topic guide in participants’ preferred language (Malay, Mandarin, or Tamil). All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and coded using Nvivo. Analysis was performed thematically, informed by the Necessity-Concerns Framework. A total of 46 carers (16 Malays, 21 Indians, 9 Chinese) contributed to 12 focus groups and one individual interview. We categorised participants’ as ‘Non-CAM’; ‘CAM’; or ‘combination’ user. Cultural practices and beliefs in the efficacy of CAM resulted in widespread use of CAM. Most carers used CAM as ‘complementary’ to E-B medicine. Concerns about dependence on or side effects of E-B treatment influenced carers’ decisions to rely on CAM as an ‘alternative’, with an important minority of accounts describing potentially harmful CAM-use. Healthcare professionals should discuss beliefs about the necessity for and concerns about use of both E-B medicine and CAM, and provide balanced information about effectiveness and safety. The aim is to improve adherence to regular E-B preventer medication and prevent delays in seeking medical advice and harmful practices associated with CAM. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,salbutamol; alternative medicine; Article; asthma; black cumin; caregiver; child; evidence based medicine; female; honey; human; interview; male; practice guideline; questionnaire,2-s2.0-85062078982

The aim of this study was to investigate how T3 exert anti-cancer effects on MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells. The MDA-MB-231 cells were chosen for this study as they are triple-negative and highly metastatic cells, which form aggressive tumors in experimental models. The MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with varying concentrations (0–20 ?g?mL?1) of gamma (γ) or delta (δ) T3 and the secretome profiles of these cells treated with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of γT3 (5.8 ?g?mL?1) or δT3 (4.0 ?g?mL?1) were determined using label-free quantitative proteomic strategy. A total of 103, 174 and 141 proteins were identified with ProteinLynx Global Server (PLGS) score of more than 200 and above 25% sequence coverage in the untreated control and T3-treated cell culture supernatant respectively. A total of 18 proteins were dysregulated between untreated control and T3 (δT3 or γT3) treated conditions. The results showed that T3 treatment downregulated the exogenous Cathepsin D and Serpine1 proteins but upregulated Profilin-1 protein, which play a key role in breast cancer in the MDA-MB-231 cells. These findings strongly suggest that T3 may induce differential expression of secreted proteins involved in the cytoskeletal regulation of RHO GTPase signaling pathway. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,actin; actin cytoplasmic 1; alpha tocotrienol; beta 2 microglobulin; cathepsin D; cystatin C; delta tocotrienol; epididymal secretory protein; epididymal secretory protein e1; galectin 3; gamma tocotrienol; metalloproteinase inhibitor; plasminogen activator inhibitor 1; pote ankyrin domain family member f; pote ankyrin domain family member j; potem protein; profilin 1; protein; putative beta actin like protein 3; Rho guanine nucleotide binding protein; somatomedin binding protein 7; thrombospondin 1; tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1; unclassified drug; antineoplastic activity; Article; breast cancer; cell culture; cell viability; concentration response; down regulation; drug effect; human; human cell; IC50; MDA-MB-231 cell line; protein analysis; protein expression; protein protein interaction; protein secretion; proteomics; quantitative analysis; signal transduction; upregulation,2-s2.0-85065800818

Poorer countries do not usually have the rehabilitation workforce needed to promote societal inclusion and participation. The roles of the rehabilitation workforce were often not clearly defined, leading to task shifting among rehabilitation professionals. Barriers to capacity building were poor availability of human resources and insufficient training program/supports for their professional development. Facilitators were local government support and international non-governmental organizations collaboration. Recommendations for capacity building effort are for collaboration with the developed nations to encourage funding, training, education, and sharing of resources. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Barriers; Capacity building; Facilitators; Low middle income; Rehabilitation; Various,attitude to health; capacity building; caregiver; developed country; disability; financial management; government; health care policy; health workforce; human; international non-governmental organization; intersectoral collaboration; low income country; middle income country; priority journal; quality of life; rehabilitation care; Review; training; work capacity; capacity building; developing country; disabled person; education; rehabilitation; Capacity Building; Developing Countries; Disabled Persons; Health Policy; Humans; Rehabilitation; Workforce,2-s2.0-85071102018

Current methods used in assessing kidney function suffer inaccuracy in HIV-infected patients. This study aims to identify biomarkers that could complement existing methods of kidney assessment among HIV-infected subjects. Methods: Plasma protein profiling was performed for HIV patients with CKD presented with negative/trace proteinuria (non-proteinuric) (n = 8) and their matched non-CKD controls, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE); selected protein candidates were identified using mass spectrometry. Subsequently, altered plasma abundance of protein candidates were verified using Western blotting in HIV-infected subjects with non-proteinuric CKD (n = 8), proteinuric CKD (n = 5), and their matched non-CKD controls, as well as in HIV-uninfected subjects with impaired kidney function (n = 3) and their matched controls. Results: Analysis of 2DE found significantly altered abundance of five protein candidates between HIV-infected patients with non-proteinuric CKD and without CKD: alpha-1-microglobulin (A1M), serum albumin (ALB), zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (AZGP1), haptoglobin (HP), and retinol binding protein (RBP4). Western blotting showed an increased abundance of A1M and HP in HIV-infected patients with non-proteinuric CKD compared to their non-CKD controls, whereas A1M, AZGP1, and RBP4 were significantly increased in HIV-infected patients with proteinuric CKD compared to their non-CKD controls. Such pattern was not found in HIV-uninfected subjects with impaired kidney function. Conclusion: The data suggests four proteins that may be used as biomarkers of CKD in HIV-infected patients. Further validation in a larger cohort of HIV-infected patients is necessary for assessing the clinical use of these proposed biomarkers for CKD. ? 2019 The Canadian Society of Clinical Chemists",Biomarker; Circulating protein; Human immunodeficiency virus; Proteome; Renal dysfunction; Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE),"alpha 1 microglobulin; biological marker; glycoprotein; haptoglobin; plasma protein; retinol binding protein 4; serum albumin; unclassified drug; zinc alpha 2 glycoprotein; biological marker; plasma protein; adult; Article; chronic kidney failure; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; kidney function; male; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; priority journal; proteinuria; proteomics; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Western blotting; aged; blood; chronic kidney failure; clinical trial; complication; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; metabolism; middle aged; Aged; Biomarkers; Blood Proteins; Female; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Proteinuria; Proteomics; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",2-s2.0-85070923794

Background: Because of the demanding nature of their work, nurses often have significantly high levels of stress, anxiety and depression. MBSR has been reported to be an effective intervention to decrease psychological distress. Design: Systematic review. Methods: The databases included were Science Direct, PubMed, EBSCO host, Springer Link and Web of Science from 2002 to 2018. Interventional studies published in English that used MBSR among nurses to reduce their psychological distress were retrieved for review. The PRISMA guideline was used in this systematic review. The included studies were assessed for quality using “The Quality Assessment Tool For Quantitative Studies (QATFQS).”. Results: Nine studies were found to be eligible and included in this review. Many benefits, including reduced stress, anxiety, depression, burnout and better job satisfaction, were reported in these studies. Conclusion: The adapted/brief versions of MBSR seem promising for reducing psychological distress in nurses. Future research should include randomised controlled trials with a larger sample size and follow-up studies. There should also be a focus on creative and effective ways of delivering MBSR to nurses. Relevance to clinical practice: The results of this review are substantial for supporting the use of MBSR for nurses’ psychological well-being. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",anxiety; depression; mindfulness; nurses; psychological distress; stress; systematic review,"anxiety; depression; distress syndrome; female; human; job satisfaction; mental stress; mindfulness; nurse; psychology; therapy; Anxiety; Depression; Female; Humans; Job Satisfaction; Mindfulness; Nurses; Psychological Distress; Stress, Psychological",2-s2.0-85069873251

Objective: To investigate prevalence and predictors of PREM defined by IDAA1c. Methods: Six hundred fourteen of 678 children (aged <15 years) with new-onset T1D (2000-2013) from a regional pediatric diabetes service (Auckland, New Zealand). Results: Overall rate of PREM at 3 months was 42.4%, and lower in M?ori/Pacific children (28.6%; P =.006) and those of other ethnicities (28.8%; P =.030) compared with New Zealand Europeans (50.4%). Comparing the most and least deprived socioeconomic quintiles, the odds of PREM were lower among the most deprived (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.44; P =.019). Lower rates of PREM were seen in children aged 0 to 4.9 years (23.8%) and 10 to 14 years (40.9%) than in children aged 5 to 9.9 years (57.4%; P <.05). Further predictors of lower rates of PREM were ketoacidosis at diagnosis (aOR 0.54 with DKA; P =.002) and diabetes duration (aOR 0.84 per month; P <.0001). Patient's sex, body mass index standard deviation score, or autoantibodies were not associated with PREM. PREM at 3 months was associated with lower HbA1c over 18 months compared with children not in PREM (65.0 vs 71.3 mmol/mol; P <.0001), independent of ketoacidosis. Conclusions: This study on a regional cohort of youth with T1D showed social and ethnic disparities in rates of PREM defined by IDAA1c. Further research into reducing ketoacidosis rates at diagnosis and addressing factors associated with lower rates of PREM in non-European children are important health priorities. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

We aimed to validate this approach using data collected from the Gut and Obesity in Asia Workgroup. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of data from 759 patients with biopsy-proven NAFLD (24% with advanced fibrosis), seen at 10 centers in 9 countries in Asia, from 2006 through 2018. By using liver biopsies as the reference standard, we calculated percentages of misclassifications and indeterminate or discordant results from assessments made based on fibrosis scores (NAFLD fibrosis score [NFS] or Fibrosis-4 score) and liver stiffness measurements (LSMs), alone or in combination. The analysis was repeated using randomly selected subgroups with a different prevalence of advanced fibrosis (histologic fibrosis stage ?F3). Results: In groups in which 3.7% and 10% of patients had advanced fibrosis, a 2-step approach (using the NFS followed by LSM only for patients with indeterminate or high NFS) and using a gray zone of 10 to 15 kPa for LSM, produced indeterminate or discordant results for 6.9% of patients and misclassified 2.7% of patients; only 25.6% of patients required LSM. In the group in which 10% of patients had advanced fibrosis, the same approach produced indeterminate or discordant results for 7.9% of patients and misclassified 6.6% of patients; only 27.4% of patients required LSM. In groups in which 24% and 50% of patients had advanced fibrosis, using LSM ?10 kPa alone for the diagnosis of advanced fibrosis had the highest accuracy and misclassified 18.1% and 18.3% of patients, respectively. These results were similar when the Fibrosis-4 score was used in place of NFS. Conclusions: In a retrospective analysis, we found that a 2-step approach using fibrosis scores followed by LSM most accurately detects advanced fibrosis in populations with a low prevalence of advanced fibrosis. However, LSM ?10 kPa identifies patients with advanced fibrosis with the highest level of accuracy in populations with a high prevalence of advanced fibrosis. ? 2019 AGA Institute",Fibroscan; GO ASIA; Noninvasive; Transient Elastography,adult; advanced liver fibrosis; area under the curve; Article; Asia; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; digestive system disease assessment; female; Fibrosis 4 Score; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; liver fibrosis; liver stiffness measurement; major clinical study; male; middle aged; Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease Fibrosis Score; patient identification; predictive value; prevalence; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; transient elastography; validation study,2-s2.0-85066929952

Mind–body treatments such as hypnosis are available to help prepare women to maintain or improve their well-being postpartum. The aims of the present study are to determine the effectiveness of a hypnosis intervention in alleviating psychological symptoms (stress, anxiety, and depression) and the symptoms of postpartum depression. A quasi-experimental design was utilized in this study. The experimental group participants (n =?28) received a hypnosis intervention at weeks 16, 20, 28, and 36 of their pregnancies. Participants in the control group (n =?28) received routine prenatal care. The final data collection, occurring at two months postpartum, included 16 women from the experimental group and 11 women from the control group. The Depression Anxiety Stress Scale–21 (DASS-21) was used to measure psychological symptoms, and postpartum depression was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS). The results at two months postpartum showed that the experimental group had significantly lower postpartum anxiety than the control group (M =?2.88 versus M =?38.36, p =?.023). Similarly, the experimental group had significantly lower postpartum depressive symptoms than the control group (M =?1.25 versus M =?6.73, p <?.002). Group differences in postpartum stress symptoms were not significant (p =?.363). Finally, the results indicated that the experimental group experienced reduced postpartum depression when compared to the control group (M =?5.69 versus M =?10.64, p <?.001).

Undiagnosed sleep apnea is a hidden health crisis to the patient and it could raise the risk of heart diseases, high blood pressure, depression and diabetes. The throat muscle (i.e., tongue and soft palate) relax narrows the airway and causes the blockage of the airway in breathing. To understand this phenomenon computational fluid dynamics method has emerged as a handy tool to conduct the modeling and analysis of airflow characteristics. The comprehensive fluid-structure interaction method provides the realistic visualization of the airflow and interaction with the throat muscle. Thus, this paper reviews the scientific work related to the fluid-structure interaction (FSI) for the evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea, using computational techniques. In total 102 articles were analyzed, each article was evaluated based on the elements related with fluid-structure interaction of sleep apnea via computational techniques. In this review, the significance of FSI for the evaluation of obstructive sleep apnea has been critically examined. Then the flow properties, boundary conditions and validation of the model are given due consideration to present a broad perspective of CFD being applied to study sleep apnea. Finally, the challenges of FSI simulation methods are also highlighted in this article. ? 2019",Computational fluid dynamics; Fluid-structure interaction; Obstructive sleep apnea; Sleep related breathing disorders; Upper airway,Air; Blood pressure; Computational fluid dynamics; Health risks; Muscle; Respiratory mechanics; Sleep research; Airflow characteristics; Breathing disorders; Computational fluid dynamics methods; Computational technique; High blood pressures; Obstructive sleep apnea; Sleep-related breathing disorders; Upper airway; Fluid structure interaction; airflow; breathing disorder; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; computational fluid dynamics; flow rate; fluid flow; fluid structure interaction; fluid transport; human; mathematical analysis; respiratory airflow; Review; shear stress; sleep disordered breathing; sleep related breathing disorder; systematic review; throat; turbulent flow; upper respiratory tract,2-s2.0-85070705180

Methods: We used data from the AIDS Care Cohort to Evaluate Exposure to Survival Services (ACCESS) study, a long-running study of a community-recruited cohort of HIV-positive PWUD, linked to comprehensive HIV clinical records in Vancouver, Canada, a setting of no-cost, universal access to HIV care. The longitudinal relationship between MMT-ART dispensation at the same facility and the odds of ??95% ART adherence was analysed using multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects modelling. We conducted a further analysis using a marginal structural mode with inverse probability of treatment weights as a sensitivity analysis. Results: This study included data on 1690 interviews of 345 ART- and MMT-exposed participants carried out between June 2012 and December 2017. In the final multivariable model, MMT-ART dispensation, compared with nondispensation at the same facility, was associated with greater odds of achieving ??95% adherence [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 1.56; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.26–1.96]. A marginal structural model estimated a 1.48 (95% CI 1.15–1.80) greater odds of ??95% adherence among participants who reported MMT-ART dispensation at the same facility compared with those who did not. Conclusions: The odds of achieving optimal adherence to ART were 56% higher during periods in which MMT and ART medications were dispensed at the same facility, in a low-barrier setting. Our findings highlight the need to consider a simpler integrated approach with medication dispensation at the same facility in low-threshold settings. ? 2019 British HIV Association","antiretroviral therapy, highly active; HIV; medication adherence; methadone; people who use illicit drugs",methadone; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; cohort analysis; female; health care access; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; maintenance therapy; major clinical study; male; methadone treatment; observational study; patient compliance; priority journal; prospective study; self report; sensitivity analysis; structural model,2-s2.0-85070228039

Methods: Cross-sectional data obtained from the first wave of the Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research (MELoR) study were utilized for this study. Participants aged 55?years and over were recruited using simple random sampling from the electoral rolls of three local parliamentary constituencies. Socio-demographics, falls history and medical history were obtained through home-based computer-assisted interviews while anthropometric measurements, including WHR, and physical performance were obtained during hospital-based health checks. WHR was categorized into three arbitrary categories stratified by gender. Results: Data on both falls and WHR were available for 1335 participants, mean age ± standard deviation (SD) = 68.4 ± 7.1?years. Logistic regression analyses using dummy variables revealed that individuals within the higher WHR group were significantly more likely to report a history of fall in the preceding 12?months {adjusted odds ratio (aOR) [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 1.78 (1.18–2.67)}, fear of falling [aOR (95% CI) = 1.58 (1.08–2.32)], impaired timed-up-and-go [2.14 (1.44–3.17)] and reduced functional reach [1.68 (1.18–2.38)] compared to those with lower WHR. A higher WHR remained independently associated with increased risk of falls compared to those with lower WHR after additional adjustment for fear of falling and functional performance. Conclusion: Our finding suggests WHR as an independent risk factor for higher risk of fall which may indicate body shape as a potentially modifiable risk factor for falls in adults in aged 55?years and over. ? 2019, ? 2019, European Geriatric Medicine Society.",Accidental falls; Aged; Hip circumference; Obesity; Waist circumference,adult; aged; Article; body build; community dwelling person; cross-sectional study; fall risk; falling; fear of falling; female; grip strength; groups by age; human; interview; longitudinal study; male; medical history; middle aged; physical performance; priority journal; risk assessment; timed up and go test; waist hip ratio,2-s2.0-85069944669

Fecal samples were examined using direct smear, formalin-ether sedimentation (FES), agar plate culture (APC) and PCR techniques. Overall, 15.8% of the children were found to be infected with S. stercoralis. The prevalence was 0.2, 1.3, 15.2 and 13.7% by direct smear, FES, APC and PCR, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that an age of >10 years, being male, belonging to a Proto-Malay tribe, belonging to the Senoi tribe, indiscriminate defecation, using an unimproved water source for drinking water and not wearing shoes when outside were the significant risk factors of infection among these children. In conclusion, we provide new evidence on the occurrence of S. stercoralis in Malaysia to show that there is a relatively high prevalence of infection among Orang Asli schoolchildren. Therefore, the use of specific methods for detecting S. stercoralis should be considered when screening these children for intestinal parasites. Moreover, prevention and control measures specific to S. stercoralis should be integrated into the intestinal parasitic infections control programme in Malaysia. ? 2019 Cambridge University Press.",Malaysia; neglected tropical diseases; Orang Asli; schoolchildren; soil-transmitted helminth; Strongyloides stercoralis,agar; drinking water; Article; child; cross-sectional study; disease transmission; female; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; Orang Asli; personal hygiene; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; priority journal; risk factor; school child; sedimentation; strongyloidiasis; water supply,2-s2.0-85069525916

Blast protein analysis indicated the lectin to be homologous to jacalin-related plant lectin. In its native form, Rhinocelectin exists as a homo-tetramer predicted with four chains of identical proteins consisting of 11 beta-sheet structures with only one alpha-helix structure. The antiproliferative activity of the Rhinocelectin against human cancer cell lines was concentration dependent and selective.

The five main categories of marine debris comprise of plastic, paper, metal, textile, glass and rubber. Plastics is recognised as the major constituent of marine debris, representing between 50% and 90% of the total marine debris found globally. Between 4.8 and 12.7 million metric tonnes of consumer plastics end up in the world oceans annually, resulting in the presence of more than 100 million particles of macroplastics in only 12 regional seas worldwide, and with 51 trillion particles of microplastic floating on the ocean surface globally. The impacts of marine debris can be branched out into three categories; injury to or death of marine organisms, harm to marine environment and effects on human health and economy. Marine mammals often accidentally ingest marine debris because of its appearance that can easily be mistaken as food. Moreover, floating plastics may act as vehicles for chemicals and/or environmental contaminants, which may be absorbed on to their surface during their use and permanence into the environment. Additionally, floating plastics is a potential vector for the introduction of invasive species that get attached to it, into the marine environment. In addition, human beings are not excluded from the impact of marine debris as they become exposed to microplastics through seafood consumption. Moreover, landscape degradation owing to debris accumulation is an eyesore and aesthetically unpleasant, thus resulting in decreased tourism and subsequent income loss. There are a wide range of initiatives that have been taken to tackle the issue of marine debris. They may involve manual removal of marine debris from coastal and aquatic environment in form of programmes and projects organised, such as beach clean-ups by scientific communities, non-governmental organizations and the removal of marine litter from Europe’s four regional seas, respectively. Other initiatives focus on assessment, reduction, prevention and management of marine debris under the umbrella of international (the United Nations Environment Programme/Mediterranean Action Plan, the Oslo/Paris Convention) and regional organisations – that is, the Helsinki Commission. There are also a number of international conventions and national regulations that encourage mitigation and management of marine debris. However, it is argued that these initiatives are short-term unsustainable solutions and the long-term sustainable solution would be adoption of circular economy. Similarly, four of the sustainable developmental goals have targets that promote mitigation of marine debris by efficient waste management and practice of 3R. As evident by the Ad Hoc Expert Group on Marine Litter and Microplastics meeting, tackling the marine debris crisis is not a straightforward, one-size-fits-all solution, but rather an integrated and continuous effort required at local, regional and global level. ?

However, most previous studies have focused more on safety issues (e.g., injuries and accidents) rather than health outcomes (e.g., illnesses, stress, etc). A comprehensive review is also lacking in relation to understanding the organisational climate–health relationship between different levels of analysis, different data sources and different analytical procedures. We conducted a systematic review to investigate previous scholarly contributions to organisational climate and health. The reviewed articles were obtained from three databases: ISI Web of Knowledge, PsycINFO and EBSCOHost Academic Premier Search. After reading the abstracts and full texts, we included 56 articles in our review. We found that the influence of organisational climate on employee health has been supported in prior research. However, hypotheses at the individual level are more frequently supported than those at the organisational level. Even though most studies analysed self-reported data and, thus, possibly suffered from common method bias, half of the studies were explicitly or implicitly trying to reduce the bias. Studies with and without remedies for reducing common method bias yielded similar results, suggesting that common method bias has little impact on organisational climate research. Overall, almost no differences were found among the different organisational climate constructs. The current review includes several recommendations for future research. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,Industrial hygiene; Personnel; Analytical procedure; Common method bias; Individual levels; Levels of analysis; Occupational health and safety; Organisational climates; Organisational level; Systematic Review; Health; employee attitude; geographic distribution; human; methodology; occupational health; occupational safety; organization and management; organizational climate; organizational policy; priority journal; psychological aspect; Review; self report; systematic review; workplace,2-s2.0-85066480314

Devices allowing an exact topographic localisation of the lesion in the resected tissue could reduce re-excision rates by optimising the intraoperative detection of involved margins. Methods: 80 patients with invasive breast cancer receiving BCS after neoadjuvant chemotherapy were included in this non-randomized case-control study. 40 patients with specimen radiography performed in a standard approach (control group) were compared to 40 patients with use of a radiopaque tissue transfer system (study group). Results: 19/80 (23.75%) patients required re-excision because of involved margins; among those, 14/40 (35%) were in the control group and 5/40 (12.5%) in the study group. The association between the use of the radiopaque tissue transfer system and the lower re-excision rate was statistically significant (p = 0.023).

Risk factors for gallstones include obesity, diabetes, smoking and physical inactivity, all of which are known risk factors for colorectal cancer (CRC), as is inflammation. However, it is unclear whether gallstones are a risk factor for CRC. We examined the association between history of gallstones and CRC in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) study, a prospective cohort of over half a million participants from ten European countries. History of gallstones was assessed at baseline using a self-reported questionnaire. The analytic cohort included 334,986 participants; a history of gallstones was reported by 3,917 men and 19,836 women, and incident CRC was diagnosed among 1,832 men and 2,178 women (mean follow-up: 13.6 years). Hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between gallstones and CRC were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression models, stratified by sex, study centre and age at recruitment. The models were adjusted for body mass index, diabetes, alcohol intake and physical activity. A positive, marginally significant association was detected between gallstones and CRC among women in multivariable analyses (HR = 1.14, 95%CI 0.99–1.31, p = 0.077). The relationship between gallstones and CRC among men was inverse but not significant (HR = 0.81, 95%CI 0.63–1.04, p = 0.10).

Methods: This is a multicenter observational study of first-line afatinib in Malaysian patients with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-mutant advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients' demographic, clinical and treatment data, as well as resistance mechanisms to afatinib were retrospectively captured. The statistical methods included Chi-squared test and independent t-test for variables, Kaplan-Meier curve and log-rank test for survival, and Cox regression model for multivariate analysis. Results: Eighty-five patients on first-line afatinib from 1st October 2014 to 30th April 2018 were eligible for the study. EGFR mutations detected in tumors included exon 19 deletion in 80.0%, exon 21 L858R point mutation in 12.9%, and rare or complex EGFR mutations in 7.1% of patients. Among these patients, 18.8% had Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 2-4, 29.4% had symptomatic brain metastases and 17.6% had abnormal organ function. Afatinib 40 mg or 30 mg once daily were the most common starting and maintenance doses. Only one-tenth of patients experienced severe side-effects with none having grade 4 toxicities. The objective response rate was 76.5% while the disease control rate was 95.3%. At the time of analysis, 56 (65.9%) patients had progression of disease (PD) with a median progression-free survival (mPFS) of 14.2 months (95% CI, 11.85-16.55 months). Only 12.5% of the progressed patients developed new symptomatic brain metastases. The overall survival (OS) data was not mature. Thirty-three (38.8%) patients had died with a median OS of 28.9 months (95% CI, 19.82-37.99 months). The median follow-up period for the survivors was 20.0 months (95% CI, 17.49-22.51 months). Of patients with PD while on afatinib, 55.3% were investigated for resistance mechanisms with exon 20 T790 M mutation detected in 42.0% of them. Conclusions: Afatinib is an effective first-line treatment for patients with EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC with a good response rate and long survival, even in patients with unfavorable clinical characteristics. The side-effects of afatinib were manageable and T790 M mutation was the most common resistance mechanism causing treatment failure. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Afatinib; Dose adjustment; Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); Real-world; Tyrosine kinase inhibitor,"afatinib; antineoplastic agent; EGFR protein, human; epidermal growth factor receptor; protein kinase inhibitor; aged; clinical trial; female; genetics; human; lung tumor; male; metabolism; middle aged; multicenter study; mutation; non small cell lung cancer; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Afatinib; Aged; Antineoplastic Agents; Carcinoma, Non-Small-Cell Lung; ErbB Receptors; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Protein Kinase Inhibitors; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85071973263

In 2018, there were 80 615 dengue cases with 147 deaths in Malaysia. Currently, the nationwide surveillance programs are dependent on Aedes larval surveys and notifications of lab-confirmed human infections. The existing, reactive programs appear to lack sensitivity and proactivity. More efficient dengue vector surveillance/control methods are needed. Methods: A parallel, cluster, randomized controlled, interventional trial is being conducted for 18 months in Damansara Damai, Selangor, Malaysia, to determine the efficacy of using gravid oviposition sticky (GOS) trap and dengue non-structural 1 (NS1) antigen test for early surveillance of dengue among Aedes mosquitoes to reduce dengue outbreaks. Eight residential apartments were randomly assigned into intervention and control arms. GOS traps are set at the apartments to collect Aedes weekly, following which dengue NS1 antigen is detected in these mosquitoes. When a dengue-positive mosquito is detected, the community will be advised to execute vector search-and-destroy and protective measures. The primary outcome concerns the the percentage change in the (i) number of dengue cases and (ii) durations of dengue outbreaks. Whereas other outcome measures include the change in density threshold of Aedes and changes in dengue-related knowledge, attitude and practice among cluster inhabitants. Discussion: This is a proactive and early dengue surveillance in the mosquito vector that does not rely on notification of dengue cases. Surveillance using the GOS traps should be able to efficiently provide sufficient coverage for multistorey dwellings where population per unit area is likely to be higher. Furthermore, trapping dengue-infected mosquitoes using the GOS trap, helps to halt the dengue transmission carried by the mosquito. It is envisaged that the results of this randomized controlled trial will provide a new proactive, cheap and targeted surveillance tool for the prevention and control of dengue outbreaks. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Aedes; Cluster randomized controlled trial; Dengue; Dengue NS1 test; Gravid oviposition sticky trap; Mosquito; Surveillance,"viral protein; virus antigen; Aedes; animal; Dengue virus; egg laying; health survey; isolation and purification; physiology; randomized controlled trial (topic); virology; Aedes; Animals; Antigens, Viral; Dengue Virus; Oviposition; Population Surveillance; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Viral Nonstructural Proteins",2-s2.0-85071778147

The objectives of this study were to determine the genotypic and phenotypic characteristics of K. pneumoniae strains isolated from Malaysian swine farms and the transferability of ESBL genes by plasmids. Results: A total of 50 K. pneumoniae strains were isolated from 389 samples, which were collected from healthy and unhealthy pigs (swine rectum and oral cavities), healthy farmers (human rectum, urine, and nasal cavities), farm's environment, and animal feeds from seven Malaysian swine farms. Antimicrobial susceptibility analysis of these 50 K. pneumoniae strains showed that the majority (86%) were resistant to tetracycline, while 44% and 36% of these strains were MDR and ESBL producers, respectively. PCR and DNA sequencing of the amplicons showed the occurrence of blaTEM (15/18), blaSHV (15/18), blaCTX-M-1 group (7/18), and blaCTX-M-2 group (2/18), while only class 1 integron-encoded integrase was detected. Conjugation experiments and plasmid analysis indicated that the majority of the ESBL genes were plasmid encoded and the plasmids in 11 strains were conjugative. Genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and repetitive extragenic palindrome-polymerase chain reaction (REP-PCR) showed that these 50 strains were genetically diverse with 44 pulsotypes and 43 REP-PCR subtypes. Conclusions: ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains showed high resistance to tetracycline as this antibiotic is used for prophylaxis and therapeutic purposes at the swine farms. The findings in this study have drawn attention to the issue of increasing MDR in animal husbandry and it should be taken seriously to prevent the spread and treatment failure due to antimicrobial resistance. ?

However, there is accumulating evidence that chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy can induce epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in disseminated or circulating NSCLC cells. Here, we describe the first case of EMT as the cause of recurrence and metastasis in a patient with resected stage IIB lung adenosquamous carcinoma after adjuvant chemotherapy. We review the literature and explore the possible mechanisms by which EMT occurs in disseminated tumor cells (DTC) or circulating tumor cells (CTC) in response to adjuvant chemotherapy (cisplatin) as a stressor. We also explore the possible therapeutic strategies to reverse EMT in patients with recurrence. In summary, although adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in resected NSCLC does extend survival, it may lead to the adverse phenomenon of EMT in disseminated tumor cells (DTC) or circulating tumor cells (CTC) causing recurrence and metastasis. ? 2019 The Authors.

In this study, we assessed whether antibody responses to F. nucleatum are associated with colorectal cancer risk in prediagnostic serum samples in the European Prospective Investigation into Nutrition and Cancer (EPIC) cohort. Methods: We applied a multiplex serology assay to simultaneously measure antibody responses to 11 F. nucleatum antigens in prediagnostic serum samples from 485 colorectal cancer cases and 485 matched controls. Conditional logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Results: We observed neither a statistically significant colorectal cancer risk association for antibodies to individual F. nucleatum proteins nor for combined positivity to any of the 11 proteins (OR, 0.81; 95% CI, 0.62–1.06). Conclusions: Antibody responses to F. nucleatum proteins in prediagnostic serum samples from a subset of colorectal cancer cases and matched controls within the EPIC study were not associated with colorectal cancer risk. Impact: Our findings in prospectively ascertained serum samples contradict the existing literature on the association of F. nucleatum with colorectal cancer risk.

A significant reduction of HBV DNA level was observed in those drinking three or more cups of coffee per day, with a median reduction of 523 IU/mL (P = 0.003). Reduction of HBsAg level was observed in those drinking two cups per day, with a median reduction of 37 IU/mL (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that increased coffee intake (P = 0.015) and lower ALT level (P = 0.033) were the significant predictors for a lower HBV DNA level, whereas increased coffee intake (P = 0.002) and having a family history of HBV infection (P = 0.021) were the significant predictors for a lower HBsAg level.

Design Qualitative study by means of semistructured interviews with women and key informants, using social-ecological model as a conceptual framework. Setting Interviews were conducted in Kota Bharu district, Kelantan, a northeast state in Peninsular Malaysia. Participants Eighteen women of reproductive age (18 to 44 years old) that experienced their first marriage below the age of 18, as well as five key informants, consisting of a government officer, a community leader, an officer from religious department and two mothers. The women were recruited from a reproductive health clinic. The key informants who had specialised knowledge related to child marriage were selectively chosen. Results Three themes emerged that aligned with the social-ecological model: immaturity in decision-making, family poverty and religious and cultural norms. Conclusions The findings imply that sex education and awareness-building activities regarding the consequences of child marriage must be implemented to eradicate child marriage in Malaysia. Such implementation must be coordinated as a team-based approach involving experts in such fields as law, religion, psychology, social-welfare and public health. In order to increase the awareness of child marriage consequences, the target for awareness must extend not only to the adolescent girls and their families, but also to the community and society at large by clearly communicating the negative consequences of and addressing the drivers for child marriage. ?

We also review the clonal types and characteristics of Malaysian S. aureus isolates, where hospital-associated (HA) MRSA isolates tend to carry staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) type III and were of sequence type (ST)239, whereas community-associated (CA) isolates are mostly SCCmec type IV/V and ST30. More comprehensive surveillance data that include molecular epidemiological data would enable further in-depth understanding of Malaysian S. aureus isolates. ? 2019 by the authors.

Methods A nationwide cross-sectional survey among Secondary One male students in Malaysia. Results Among 2823 respondents, knowledge about HPV infection and the HPV vaccine was extremely poor. The mean total knowledge score was only 3.17 (SD ± 2.14), out of a possible score of 10. The majority of respondents were unaware that vaccinating boys can help protect girls against HPV infection (81.6%), and HPV is a sexually transmitted infection (70.1%). Many had the misconception that only females get HPV (78.9%). In multivariable analysis, the factors associated with the intention to receive the HPV vaccination were: agreeing boys need to be vaccinated against HPV infection (odds ratio [OR], 2.05; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.57-2.68), perceiving their parents might allow them to get the HPV vaccine (OR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.18-2.34), perceived susceptibility to HPV infection (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.06-2.52), and attending a rural school (OR, 1.49; 95% CI, 1.14-1.95). Conclusions Public health educational programs that are focused and tailored on parents consenting to HPV vaccination for boys at a young age can be useful in improving HPV vaccination rates among boys. There is also a pressing need to educate boys about the benefits of HPV vaccination in males and about HPV disease susceptibility to facilitate adoption of the HPV vaccine by young adults in the future. ? 2019 American Sexually Transmitted Diseases Association.

With this in mind, the current study aimed to investigate the cytotoxicity effects of one of the multifloral Malaysian honey, Kelulut honey (Trigona itama), as a potential natural anticancer agent in stimulating apoptosis and cell cycle arrest to a human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line (A549). Methods: The cells were treated with various concentrations of T. itama honey for 24, 48 and 72 h. The cytotoxicity and cell viability were determined using trypan blue exclusion assay (TBEA) and flow cytometric analysis. Results: The moisture content in the analysed honey was 14.3 ± 0.8%, which was within the accepted international standard. The pH, electrical conductivity and proline content were 3.17 ± 0.02, 0.47 mS/cm - 0.55 mS/cm and 19.1 mg/kg 20.2 mg/kg respectively. The findings demonstrated a significant dose and time-dependent inhibitory effect of T. itama honey with the maximum cytotoxic effects observed at 72 h with 20% concentration of T. itama honey, indicating 100% growth inhibition. Meanwhile, IC50 of T. itama honey treatment for A549 cells was determined as 0.62% v/v. Moreover, T. itama honey had a promising cytotoxic effect and proven capable of inducing cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase at 72 h of exposure with IC50 concentration. Conclusion: This study provided prefatory evidence on T. itama honey's significant anticancer activity against human lung cancer cell lines. ? 2019 Elsevier GmbH",Anti-cancer; Honey; Human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cell; In-vitro cytotoxicity; Natural medicine; Trigona itama,proline; proline; A-549 cell line; A-549 cell line; antineoplastic activity; antineoplastic activity; Article; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer inhibition; cell viability; cell viability; concentration response; concentration response; controlled study; controlled study; cytotoxicity; cytotoxicity; electric conductivity; electric conductivity; flow cytometry; flow cytometry; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; G2 phase cell cycle checkpoint; honey; honey; human; human; human cell; human cell; IC50; IC50; in vitro study; in vitro study; lung adenocarcinoma cell line; lung adenocarcinoma cell line; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; M phase cell cycle checkpoint; moisture; moisture; nonhuman; nonhuman; pH; pH; priority journal; priority journal; trypan blue assay; trypan blue assay,2-s2.0-85070295604

EV-A71 also caused fatal neurological complications in young children especially in Asia. On the basis of seroepidemiological studies from many Asian countries, EV-A71 infection is very common. Children of very young age are particularly vulnerable. Large-scale epidemics that occur every 3 to 4 years are associated with accumulation of an immunologically naive younger population. Capsid proteins especially VP1 with the presence of major B- and T-cell epitopes are the most antigenic proteins. The nonstructural proteins mainly contribute to T-cell epitopes that induce cross-reactive immune responses against other enteroviruses. Dominant epitopes and their neutralization magnitudes differ in mice, rabbits, and humans. Neutralizing antibody is sufficient for immune protection, but poorer cellular immunity may lead to severe neurological complications and deaths. Some chemokines/cytokines are consistently found in severely ill patients, for example, IL-6, IL-10, IL-17A, MCP-1, IL-8, MIG, IP-10, IFN-γ, and G-CSF. An increase in white cell counts is a risk factor for severe HFMD. Recent clinical trials on EV-A71 inactivated vaccine showed >90% efficacy and a robust neutralization response that was protective, indicating neutralizing antibody correlates for protection. No protection against other enteroviruses was observed. A comprehensive understanding of the immune responses to EV-A71 infection will benefit the development of diagnostic tools, potential therapeutics, and subunit vaccine candidates. Future development of a multivalent enterovirus vaccine will require knowledge of correlates of protection, understanding of cross-protection and memory T-cell responses among enteroviruses. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",enterovirus; enterovirus A71; epitope; immune response; vaccine,Enterovirus vaccine; gamma interferon; gamma interferon inducible protein 10; granulocyte colony stimulating factor; immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; inactivated vaccine; interleukin 10; interleukin 17; interleukin 6; interleukin 8; monocyte chemotactic protein 1; neutralizing antibody; protein VP1; subunit vaccine; unclassified drug; virus vaccine; cellular immunity; cross protection; disease exacerbation; Enterovirus A71; Enterovirus infection; human; humoral immunity; immune response; innate immunity; Leporidae; leukocyte count; memory T lymphocyte; mouse; nonhuman; prevention and control; Review; seroepidemiology,2-s2.0-85070104250

In Malaysia for instance, there is no legislative framework governing the use of assisted reproductive technology and the only guidance appears to be provided by guidelines issued by the Malaysian Medical Council. In the absence of clear direction, broad guidelines or policy positions taken by such statutory bodies may heavily influence the practice or roll out of certain technologically advanced therapeutic interventions. Previous literature has construed this Guideline narrowly as prohibiting this practice. This paper argues that the narrow and traditional interpretation method used in previous literature is wanting and suggests a more meaningful approach to the interpretation of the Guideline and advocates that this interpretative method should be applied in similar instances involving technologically advanced treatment modalities in other similar situations. Such guidance documents should be interpreted in a manner which takes into account the nature of the technology, its implications and intended use. ? 2019 Fellowship of Postgraduate Medicine",Haematopoietic stem cell transplant; HLA typing; Law; Policy; Preimplantation genetic diagnosis; Saviour sibling,article; hematopoietic stem cell; HLA typing; human; infertility therapy; Malaysia; practice guideline; preimplantation genetic diagnosis; sibling,2-s2.0-85069548283

However, the particles’ stability in the enzymatic gastrointestinal environment, their drug permeability mechanism, and related in vivo studies have not been discussed to date. In this study, we investigated the stability, muco-adhesiveness, transport mechanism and in vivo assessment of the particles. The particles retained their bioactivity and displayed a generally stable behavior in the simulated enzymatic environment of the gastrointestinal tract with high muco-adhesiveness (79.1 ± 4.3%). The results of cellular membrane permeability experiments further suggested that insulin from the insulin-entrapped particles was transported across the Caco-2 cell monolayers mainly via the paracellular pathway. This activity was inferred by the trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and the apparent permeability coefficient (Papp) of the insulin-entrapped particles (22-fold greater than control insulin solution), suggesting that the opening of tight junctions (TJs) of Caco-2 cells was involved in the process. The particles did not exhibit significant cytotoxicity at 0.5–10.0 mg/mL based on 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salts (MTS) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays. Additionally, an in vivo study with diabetic Sprague Dawley (SD) rats revealed an extended blood glucose-lowering effect for up to 36 h (Cmax: 175.1 ± 23.7 mIU/L, Tmax: 5 h, AUC: 1789.4 ± 158.6). The estimated bioavailability of insulin from CS/CMCi particles in humans was 44.7–46.9%, which may be increased three fold compared with rats. Thus, the above results support the effectiveness of chitosan-complexed carboxymethylated iota-carrageenan particles as an oral insulin delivery system for extended glycemic control in basal insulin therapy. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Cytotoxicity; Diabetes mellitus; Glycemia; Insulin; Intestinal transport; Proteolytic,Adhesives; Biochemistry; Cell membranes; Chitosan; Controlled drug delivery; Cytotoxicity; Rats; Diabetes mellitus; Electrical resistances; Gastrointestinal tract; Glycemia; Intestinal transport; Lactate dehydrogenase assays; pH-responsive swellings; Proteolytic; Insulin,2-s2.0-85068251125

To eliminate the infection, identification of receptors or binding partners from humans is indeed urgent. T. gondii surface antigen is the ultimate component involved during the attachment of parasite into host cell. However, mechanism of invasion between SAG and host-cell membrane remains unclear. Yeast two-hybrid experiment was used to identify the binding partners from cDNA human library by using T. gondii SAG1 as bait. Mated yeast cells were plated on DDO/X plates to confirm only prey plasmid that expressing interacting protein was selected. We detected 39 clones interacted with SAG1 based on a series of the selection procedures. After colony PCR, only 29 clones were positive and subsequently sent for sequencing. The yeast plasmids for true positive clones were rescued by transformation into E. coli TOP 10F′ cells. Twenty-two clones were further examined by small-scale Y2H experiment. The results indicated that a strong interaction existed between Homo sapiens lysine-rich coil-coiled and SAG1 protein, which could activate the expressions of the reporter genes in diploid yeast. Co-immunoprecipitation experiment result indicated the binding between this prey and SAG1 protein was significant (Mann–Whitney U test, Z = ? 1.964, P = 0.05).

Inactivation of DNA repair pathways may play an important role in the initiation and progression of OS pathogenesis by increasing the mutation rate and genomic instability. However, there is still a lack of information on gene alterations and mutations that may increase the risk of osteosarcoma formation. Reprogramming OS cells to a primitive stage namely induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)state could be a useful disease model to understand the pathogenesis of OS and to bridge the current gap of knowledge on DNA repair mechanisms in reprogrammed OS cells. By using Yamanaka factors, OS cell lines, G-292 and Saos-2, were reprogrammed to iPSC lines, respectively iG-292 and iSaos-2, both of which demonstrated pluripotency similar to embryonic stem cells. However, only iG-292 was able to form teratoma. Subsequent microarray data showed significant down-regulation of DNA Damage Response (DDR)genes expression for both iG-292 and iSaos-2. A functional assay using UV-induced DNA damage approach demonstrated efficient DNA repair mechanism in iG-292. Further analysis of nucleotide excision repair (NER)genes demonstrated up-regulation of GADD45G, XPA, RPA, MNAT1, ERCC1, PCNA, and POLL, in iG-292. Up-regulation of GADD45G together with up-regulation of other NER genes synergistically repair UV damage by rapid removal of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers. In conclusion, down-regulation of DDR genes in reprogrammed OS may render an enhanced state of genomic integrity in reprogrammed OS as compared to the parental cells. Thus, this study demonstrated for the first time DDR profile of reprogrammed OS cells and the probable involvement of GADD45G in the DNA repair mechanism of reprogrammed OS cells. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",DNA Damage Response; DNA repair; Genomic stability; Nucleotide excision repair; Osteosarcoma; Reprogramming,cycline; excision repair cross complementing protein 1; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; growth arrest and damage inducible 45 gamma; hepatocyte nuclear factor 3beta; mnat cdk activating kinase assembly factor 1; MutL protein homolog 1; polymerase DNA lambda; protein; pyrimidine dimer; replication factor A; transcription factor GATA 2; transcription factor GATA 4; transcription factor GATA 6; transcription factor MSX1; unclassified drug; Article; DNA damage response; DNA repair; down regulation; embryonic stem cell; excision repair; gene expression; genomic instability; human; human cell; ig 292 cell line; induced pluripotent stem cell; isaos 2 cell line; microarray analysis; nuclear reprogramming; osteosarcoma; osteosarcoma cell; priority journal; teratoma; upregulation,2-s2.0-85065176274

Mosquitoes were collected from villages in an area where zoonotic malaria is prevalent. PCR analysis confirmed Anopheles balabacensis as the main vector for macaque parasites, moreover nearly 60% of the mosquitoes harboured more than one Plasmodium species. Fragments of the A-type small subunit ribosomal RNA (SS rRNA) amplified from salivary gland sporozoites, and equivalent sequences obtained from GenBank were used to construct haplotype networks. The patterns were consistent with the presence of geographically distinct populations for P. inui and P. cynomolgi, and with three discrete P. knowlesi populations. This study provides a preliminary snapshot of the structure of these populations, that was insufficient to answer our aim. Thus, collection of parasites from their various hosts and over time, associated with a systematic analysis of a set of genetical loci is strongly advocated in order to obtain a clear picture of the parasite population and the flow between different hosts.

Methods: Two villages were selected as the sampling frame based on prevalence of tobacco and betel quid chewing habit. Respondents were asked to check their mouth for presence of lesion or abnormalities. Education on oral cancer, including MSE, was provided. Subsequently, respondents were asked to perform MSE. Finally, a clinical oral examination (COE) was done by a specialist and the presence of oral mucosal lesions was recorded. Results: Almost 64.5 percent of respondents exhibited high levels of difficulty and low mucosal visualization and retracting ability, whereas 3.0 percent demonstrated high attention level when performing MSE. Prevalence of oral mucosal lesions was 59.0 percent, whereas the prevalence of oral potentially malignant disorders (OPMDs) was 9.0 percent. Detection of oral lesions by respondents using MSE was lower than detection by the gold standard. Sensitivity and specificity of MSE for detection of all types of lesions were 8.6 and 95.0 percent respectively. When analyzing each lesion type separately, MSE was found to be most sensitive in detection of swellings (10.0 percent), and most specific in identifying white lesions (97.8 percent).

We developed and validated a porcine bladder training model for transurethral resection of bladder tumour (TURBT). Methods: Urology residents and specialists were invited to test the training model. They were asked to complete a pre-task questionnaire, to perform piecemeal and en bloc resection of ‘bladder tumours’ within the training model, and to complete a post-task questionnaire afterwards. Their performances were assessed by faculty members of the AUSTEG. For the face validity, a pre-task questionnaire consisting of six statements on TURBT and the training model were set. For the content validity, a post-task questionnaire consisting of 14 items on the details of the training model were set. For the construct validity, a Global Rating Scale was used to assess the participants’ performances. The participants were stratified into two groups (junior surgeons and senior surgeons groups) according to their duration of urology training. Results: For the pre-task questionnaire, a mean score of ? 4.0 out of 5.0 was achieved in 5 out of 6 statements. For the post-task questionnaire, a mean score of ? 4.5 out of 5.0 was achieved in every item. For the Global Rating Scale, the senior surgeons group had higher scores than the junior surgeons group in 8 out of 11 items as well as the total score. Conclusion: A porcine TURBT training model has been developed, and its face, content and construct validity has been established. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Bladder cancer; Bladder tumour; Education; En bloc resection; Training model; TURBT,"animal; bladder tumor; cystectomy; disease model; education; educational model; medical education; pig; procedures; urethra; urology; Animals; Cystectomy; Disease Models, Animal; Internship and Residency; Models, Educational; Swine; Urethra; Urinary Bladder Neoplasms; Urology",2-s2.0-85058690986

In this case–control study, 190 cases with non-fatal CHD were identified and individually matched with 383 hospital-based controls. R/S was measured by self-administered 102 items questionnaire. A tabular meta-analysis was performed of observational studies on R/S (high level versus low level) and CHD.

However, most offer little support on how to have these conversations in practice. Clinicians fear that health behaviour change talk will create interactional difficulties and discomfort for both clinician and patient. This review aims to identify how healthcare professionals can best communicate with patients about health behaviour change (HBC). Methods: We included studies which used conversation analysis or discourse analysis to study recorded interactions between healthcare professionals and patients. We followed an aggregative thematic synthesis approach. This involved line-by-line coding of the results and discussion sections of included studies, and the inductive development and hierarchical grouping of descriptive themes. Top-level themes were organised to reflect their conversational positioning. Results: Of the 17,562 studies identified through systematic searching, ten papers were included. Analysis resulted in 10 top-level descriptive themes grouped into three domains: initiating; carrying out; and closing health behaviour change talk. Of three methods of initiation, two facilitated further discussion, and one was associated with outright resistance. Of two methods of conducting behaviour change talk, one was associated with only minimal patient responses. One way of closing was identified, and patients did not seem to respond to this positively. Results demonstrated a series of specific conversational practices which clinicians use when talking about HBC, and how patients respond to these. Our results largely complemented clinical guidelines, providing further detail on how they can best be delivered in practice. However, one recommended practice - linking a patient's health concerns and their health behaviours - was shown to receive variable responses and to often generate resistance displays. Conclusions: Health behaviour change talk is smoothly initiated, conducted, and terminated by clinicians and this rarely causes interactional difficulty. However, initiating conversations by linking a person's current health concern with their health behaviour can lead to resistance to advice, while other strategies such as capitalising on patient initiated discussions, or collaborating through question-answer sequences, may be well received. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Behaviour change; Communication skills; Doctor-patient communication; General practice; Health behaviours; Healthcare delivery; Primary care,adult; article; behavior change; clinician; communication skill; conversation; discourse analysis; female; general practice; health behavior; human; male; practice guideline; primary medical care; synthesis; systematic review,2-s2.0-85070194902

Majority of trauma victims are young adults aged between 21-40 years old. In Malaysia, 24 out of 100,000 population die annually due to trauma, rating us amongst the highest in South East Asia. These alarming figures justify aggressive preventive and mitigation strategies. The aim of this paper is to promote the implementation of evidence-based interventions that will reduce the rate of preventable death because of trauma. Tranexamic acid is one of the few interventions in the early management of severe trauma with level-one evidence. Tranexamic acid has been proven to reduce all causes of mortality and mortality due to bleeding. Evidence proves that it is most effective when administered early, particularly within the 1st hour of trauma. This proposed guideline is formulated based upon quality evidence from multicentre studies, clinical practices in other countries and consideration of the local demographic factors with the intent of enabling an easy and simple pathway to administer tranexamic acid early in the care of the severely injured. Conclusion: The guideline highlights select pre-hospital criteria’s and the methods for drug administration. The authors recognise that some variants may be present amongst certain institutions necessitating minor adaptations, nevertheless the core principles of advocating tranexamic acid early in the course of pre-hospital trauma should be adhered to. ? 2019, Malaysian Medical Association.

Fidelity of resultant microsatellites during DNA replication is contingent upon an intact mismatch repair (MMR) system and lack of fidelity can result in tumourigenesis. Prior to commencing routine screening for MSI-H, we assessed two commonly used methods, immunohistochemical (IHC) determination of loss of MMR gene products viz MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 against PCR amplification and subsequent fragment analysis of microsatellite markers, BAT25, BAT26, D2S123, D5S346 and D17S250 (Bethesda markers) in 73 unselected primary CRC. 15.1% (11/73) were categorized as MSI-H while deficient MMR (dMMR) was detected in 16.4% (12/73). Of the dMMR, 66.7% (8/12) were classified MSI-H, while 33.3% (4/12) were microsatellite stable/low microsatellite instability (MSS/MSI-L). Of the proficient MMR (pMMR), 95.1% (58/61) were MSS/MSI-L and 4.9% (3/61) were MSI-H. The Κ value of 0.639 (standard error =0.125; p = 0.000) indicated substantial agreement between detection of loss of DNA mismatch repair using immunohistochemistry and the detection of downstream microsatellite instability using PCR. After consideration of advantages and shortcomings of both methods, it is our opinion that the choice of preferred technique for MSI analysis would depend on the type of laboratory carrying out the testing. ? 2019, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

However, data from the indigenous (Orang Asli) people is still lacking. The Negrito population is the most remotely located Orang Asli tribe with limited access to health care facilities. This study was undertaken to determine the epidemiology and seroprevalence of HBV infection among the Negrito. Methods: Surveys were conducted in five Negrito settlements in Kelantan and Perak states in Malaysia. A total of 150 participants were recruited. Clinical history was taken and physical examination was performed. Five millilitres of whole blood were collected and tested for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) using electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. Results: Participants were mainly from the Bateq (49.3%) and Mendriq (29.4%) sub-tribes. Overall, 13 subjects (8.7 %); nine males and four females were HBsAg positive. Nine of the HBsAg positive subjects were ?35 years old. All of them had history of home deliver without evidence of antenatal record. Six (46%) of the HBsAg positive subjects had tattoo and body piercing in the past. Conclusion: The prevalence of HBV infection rate amongst the Negrito tribe is almost three-fold compared to the national rates. The reason for this finding remains unclear. Tattooing, body piercing and vertical transmission could be the main possible routes of transmission of HBV among the Negrito population in Malaysia. ? 2019, Malaysian Medical Association.

DENV infection represents one of the most widely spread mosquito-borne diseases whereas ZIKV infection occasionally re-emerged in the past causing outbreaks. Although there have been considerable advances in understanding the pathophysiology of these viruses, no effective vaccines or antiviral drugs are currently available. In this study, we evaluated the antiviral activity of carnosine, an endogenous dipeptide (β-alanyl-l-histidine), against DENV serotype 2 (DENV2) and ZIKV infection in human liver cells (Huh7). Computational studies were performed to predict the potential interactions between carnosine and viral proteins. Biochemical and cell-based assays were performed to validate the computational results. Mode-of-inhibition, plaque reduction, and immunostaining assays were performed to determine the antiviral activity of carnosine. Exogenous carnosine showed minimal cytotoxicity in Huh7 cells and rescued the viability of infected cells with EC50 values of 52.3 and 59.5 μM for DENV2 and ZIKV infection, respectively. Based on the mode-of-inhibition assays, carnosine inhibited DENV2 mainly by inhibiting viral genome replication and interfering with virus entry. Carnosine antiviral activity was verified with immunostaining assay where carnosine treatment diminished viral fluorescence signal. In conclusion, carnosine exhibited significant inhibitory effects against DENV2 and ZIKV replication in human liver cells and could be utilized as a lead peptide for the development of effective and safe antiviral agents against DENV and ZIKV. ? 2019 European Peptide Society and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",antiviral activity; carnosine; dengue virus; dipeptide; NS2B-NS3 protease; Zika virus,carnosine; viral protein; antivirus agent; carnosine; antiviral activity; Article; cell viability; dengue; Dengue virus; Dengue virus 2; EC50; Huh-7 cell line; immunohistochemistry; liver cell; mosquito; nonhuman; prediction; priority journal; protein interaction; Vero cell line; virus entry; virus genome; virus load; virus replication; virus titration; virus transmission; Zika fever; Zika virus; animal; cell survival; Chlorocebus aethiops; dengue; drug effect; human; microbial sensitivity test; Zika fever; Animals; Antiviral Agents; Carnosine; Cell Survival; Chlorocebus aethiops; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Humans; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Vero Cells; Zika Virus; Zika Virus Infection,2-s2.0-85068677815

Generic models are a novel innovation to efficiently address a critical PM evidence shortage and implementation barrier by enabling use of population-specific input values. This is a generic PM economic evaluation model proof-of-concept study for a pharmacogenomic use case. Methods: An 8-step generic economic model development process was applied to the use case of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B?15:02genotyping for prediction of carbamazepine-induced cutaneous reactions, with a user-friendly decision-making tool relying on user-provided input values. This generic model was transparently documented and validated, including cross-validation comparing cost-effectiveness results with 3 country-specific models. Results: A generic pharmacogenomic use case cost-effectiveness model with decision-making tool was successfully developed and cross-validated using input values for 6 populations which produced consistent results for HLA-B?15:02 screening at country-specific cost-effectiveness threshold values. Differences between the generic and country-specific model results were largely due to differences in model structure and assumptions. Conclusion: This proof on concept demonstrates the feasibility of generic models to provide useful PM economic evidence, supporting their use as a pragmatic and timely approach to address a growing need. ? 2019 S.

Data were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Results: Three focus groups involving 19 participants were conducted. Four major themes emerged from the data collected. Most participants enjoyed the group-based HSME sessions because sharing experiences with those having similar health problems can reduce their sense of isolation. However, the participants highlighted the difficulty in sustaining self-care practices in the presence of friends and family influences. Conclusion: A number of patient-, family- and community-level motivators and barriers to patients' hypertension self-management have been identified.

Survival and locoregional recurrence is non-inferior to mastectomy, with superior cosmetic and psycho-social outcomes. Differing health systems have demonstrated a wide variation in the rate of BCS. Little is known about the rate of BCS and factors influencing its practice in middle resource countries. This study aims to examine the BCS rates in Malaysia and to identify factors influencing its uptake. Methodology: This is a multi-centre, cross-sectional study involving the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Queen Elizabeth II Hospital (QEH), and Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Hospital (TARH). Patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer from January 2014 to December 2015 were included, excluding stromal cancers and lymphomas. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified factors influencing BCS. Results: A total of 1005 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer in the allocated time frame. Excluding incomplete records and those who did not have surgery, 730 patients were analysed. Overall BCS rate was 32.9%. The BCS rate was highest at QEH (54.1%), followed by UMMC (29.5%), and TARH (17.4%). 16.9% had BCS after neoadjuvant therapy. Factors influencing BCS uptake included age, ethnic group, breast-surgeon led services, AJCC Stage, tumour size, HER-2 expression, and tumour grade. Conclusions: The rate of BCS in Malaysia is low. A wide variation of rate exists among the studied hospitals. Younger age, earlier AJCC stage, and the presence of a Breast sub-specialist surgeon, would make it more likely that the patient has her breast conserved. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Breast cancer; Breast conserving surgery; Ethnicity; Mastectomy; Stage,"adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer staging; cohort analysis; cross-sectional study; ethnicity; gene expression; groups by age; health service; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; multicenter study; observational study; oncogene neu; partial mastectomy; priority journal; public hospital; retrospective study; surgeon; tumor volume; university hospital; breast tumor; clinical trial; ethnic group; ethnology; female; health care delivery; middle aged; multivariate analysis; partial mastectomy; pathology; public hospital; Adult; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; Female; Health Services Accessibility; Hospitals, Public; Humans; Malaysia; Mastectomy, Segmental; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Staging",2-s2.0-85067057648

We evaluated the chemopreventive activity of DCBME against 4-nitroquinolone-1-oxide (4NQO)-induced tongue carcinogenesis in rat. Design: Phase contrast microscope, acridine orange/propidium iodide (AO/PI) analysis of cells under fluorescence microscope, annexin-V flow-cytometry, DNA fragmentation, mitochondrial membrane potential, and caspase 3/7, 8 and 9 assays were performed. In vivo study, the rats were given 4NQO in their drinking water. The tongue was subjected to histopathological study to evaluate the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). Results: DCBME showed cytotoxic effect on H103 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, DCBME showed low cytotoxic effect on a normal cell line. In H103 cells, it caused cell morphology changes, S and G2/M-phase cell cycle arrest, significant reduction of cell migration and induced apoptosis through the intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathway. The incidence of SCC was 85.7% in the induced cancer and vehicle groups while in rats treated with DCBME at 100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg was 57.1%, 28.6% and 14.3%, respectively.

Although surgery is a successful curative treatment for localized RCC, most patients are diagnosed with advanced or metastatic RCC, which has poor prognosis. RCC is classified by stage and grade using tissue samples. Whilst these provide good prognostic information, they are not very useful for early detection. Proteins that are dysregulated in patient's serum can be a valuable alternative and less invasive biomarker for early detection of the disease. For this reason, a hypothesis was formed that leptin is a possible biomarker for early detection and prognostication of RCC. The literature has disparate results on the usefulness of leptin as a biomarker for the early detection of RCC. Hence, a systematic review and a meta-analysis was carried out to investigate whether serum leptin could be a reliable diagnostic and prognostic factor in RCC patients. Literature on the available cohort and case-control studies on serum leptin in RCC was searched in electronic databases and included to evaluate this adipokine in the progression of RCC. The relevant studies were evaluated for the diagnostic and prognostic value of leptin in RCC patients. Overall, only 6 original research studies matched selection criteria and were included for meta-analysis. This study was hypothesised that; leptin might be a useful biomarker for early detection and prognostication of RCC. However, the data were presented in this study did not support our hypothesis. Serum leptin levels in RCC patients do not strongly associate with the development or progression of RCC, thus cannot act as a biomarker for early detection in RCC in patients. Extending our hypothesis further to include levels of obesity and RCC development may be worthwhile, but studies are currently limited. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Body mass index; Diagnostic factor; Kidney cancer; Obesity; Prognostic factor,"adipocytokine; leptin; tumor marker; adipocytokine; LEP protein, human; leptin; tumor marker; Article; body mass; cancer prognosis; cancer staging; diagnostic value; early cancer diagnosis; hormone action; human; meta analysis; renal cell carcinoma; systematic review; tumor growth; adipose tissue; blood; complication; early cancer diagnosis; kidney tumor; metabolism; obesity; prognosis; renal cell carcinoma; theoretical model; Adipokines; Adipose Tissue; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Early Detection of Cancer; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Leptin; Models, Theoretical; Obesity; Prognosis",2-s2.0-85066104998

To obtain a high number of MSCs for transplantation requires extensive in vitro expansion with culture media supplements that can cause xeno-contamination of cells potentially compromising function and clinical outcomes. In this study stem cells from human extracted deciduous teeth (SHED) were cultured in Knockout? DMEM supplemented with either pooled human serum (pHS) or foetal bovine serum (FBS) to compare their suitability in maintaining immunomodulatory properties of cells during in vitro expansion. No significant difference in cell survival of SHED grown in pHS (pHS-SHED) or FBS (FBS-SHED) was observed when co-cultured with complement, monocytes or lymphocytes. However, significant changes in the expression of sixteen paracrine factors involved in immunomodulation were observed in the supernatants of FBS-SHED co-cultures with monocytes or lymphocytes compared to that in pHS-SHEDs after both 24 and 120 h of incubation. Further analysis of changing protein levels of paracrine factors in co-cultures using biological pathway analysis software predicted upregulation of functions associated with immunogenicity in FBS-SHED and lymphocyte co-cultures compared to pHS-SHED co-cultures. Pathway analysis also predicted significant stimulation of HMGB1 and TREM1 signalling pathways in FBS-SHED co-cultures indicating activation of immune cells and inflammation. Though FBS supplementation does not impact survival of SHED, our combinatorial biological pathway analysis supports the idea that in vitro expansion of SHEDs in pHS provides optimal conditions to minimise xeno-contamination and inflammation and maintain their immunomodulatory properties. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Allogeneic; Autologous; Paracrine factors; Regenerative medicine; Viability,high mobility group B1 protein; triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1; adult; Article; cell expansion; cell survival; controlled study; deciduous tooth; enzyme activation; fetus; human; human cell; human tissue; immunogenicity; immunomodulation; in vitro study; incubation time; lymphocyte; male; monocyte; paracrine signaling; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; serum; signal transduction; stem cell,2-s2.0-85065054664

LTFU was associated with age > 50 years [sub-hazard ratio (SHR) 1.64; 95% CI 1.17–2.31] compared with 31–40 years, viral load ? 1000 copies/mL (SHR 1.86; 95% CI 1.16–2.97) compared with viral load < 1000 copies/mL, and hepatitis C coinfection (SHR 1.48; 95% CI 1.06–2.05). LTFU was less likely to occur in females, in individuals with higher CD4 counts, in those with self-reported adherence ? 95%, and in those living in high-income countries. The 6-month LTFU definition produced an incidence rate of 3.2 per 100 PY (95% CI 2.9–3.4 and had similar associations but with greater risks of LTFU for ART initiation in later years (2006–2009: SHR 2.38; 95% CI 1.93–2.94; and 2010–2011: SHR 4.26; 95% CI 3.17–5.73) compared with 2003–2005. Conclusions: The long-term LTFU rate in our cohort was low, with older age being associated with LTFU. The increased risk of LTFU with later years of ART initiation in the 6-month analysis, but not the 12-month analysis, implies that there was a possible move towards longer HIV clinic scheduling in Asia. ? 2019 British HIV Association",Asia; HIV; long term; lost to follow-up,anti human immunodeficiency virus agent; nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor; proteinase inhibitor; RNA directed DNA polymerase inhibitor; adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; Asian; CD4 lymphocyte count; female; follow up; hepatitis B; hepatitis C; high income country; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; mixed infection; nonhuman; priority journal; virus load,2-s2.0-85064480879

We described the presenting features and natural history of primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease seen in a cohort of Southeast Asian children. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of childhood primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease from three tertiary centers in Singapore and Malaysia. Results: Of 24 patients (boys, 58%; median age at diagnosis: 6.3 years) with primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis, n = 21; Crohn's disease, n = 1; undifferentiated, n = 2), 63% (n = 15) were diagnosed during follow-up for colitis, and 21% (n = 5) presented with acute or chronic hepatitis, 17% (n = 4) presented simultaneously. Disease phenotype of liver involvement showed 79% had sclerosing cholangitis-autoimmune hepatitis overlap, 54% large duct disease, and 46% small duct disease. All patients received immunosuppression therapy. At final review after a median [±S.D.] duration follow-up of 4.7 [±3.8] years, 12.5% patients had normal liver enzymes, 75% persistent disease, and 12.5% liver failure. The proportion of patients with liver cirrhosis increased from 13% at diagnosis to 29%; 21% had portal hypertension, and 17% had liver dysfunction. One patient required liver transplant. Transplant-free survival was 95%. For colitis, 95% had pancolitis, 27% rectal sparing, and 11% backwash ileitis at initial presentation. At final review, 67% patients had quiescent bowel disease with immunosuppression. One patient who had UC with pancolitis which was diagnosed at 3 years old developed colorectal cancer at 22 years of age. All patients survived. Conclusions: Liver disease in primary sclerosing cholangitis-inflammatory bowel disease in Asian children has variable severity. With immunosuppression, two-thirds of patients have quiescent bowel disease but the majority have persistent cholangitis and progressive liver disease. ? 2018",progressive; sclerosing cholangitis; ulcerative colitis,"alanine aminotransferase; albumin; alkaline phosphatase; aspartate aminotransferase; azathioprine; bilirubin; cyclosporine; gamma glutamyltransferase; immunoglobulin G; infliximab; methotrexate; mycophenolate mofetil; prednisolone; tacrolimus; ursodeoxycholic acid; cholagogue; immunosuppressive agent; age distribution; alanine aminotransferase blood level; albumin blood level; alkaline phosphatase blood level; anorexia; Article; ascites; aspartate aminotransferase blood level; autoimmune hepatitis; bilirubin blood level; child; cholangiography; chronic hepatitis; clinical article; clinical feature; colitis; colorectal cancer; Crohn disease; disease association; disease severity; esophagus varices; family history; fatigue; female; follow up; gamma glutamyl transferase blood level; hepatomegaly; human; human tissue; hyperbilirubinemia; ileitis; immunoglobulin blood level; immunosuppressive treatment; inflammatory bowel disease; international normalized ratio; jaundice; liver cirrhosis; liver dysfunction; liver failure; liver graft; liver histology; Malaysia; male; onset age; pancolitis; phenotype; portal hypertension; preschool child; primary sclerosing cholangitis; pruritus; retrospective study; sclerosing cholangitis; Singapore; splenomegaly; survival rate; transplant free survival; ulcerative colitis; adolescent; Asian continental ancestry group; autoimmune hepatitis; biliary cirrhosis; cohort analysis; complication; Crohn disease; disease exacerbation; inflammatory bowel disease; liver disease; liver transplantation; pathophysiology; portal hypertension; sclerosing cholangitis; ulcerative colitis; young adult; Adolescent; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Child; Child, Preschool; Cholagogues and Choleretics; Cholangitis, Sclerosing; Cohort Studies; Colitis, Ulcerative; Crohn Disease; Disease Progression; Female; Hepatitis, Autoimmune; Humans; Hypertension, Portal; Immunosuppressive Agents; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Liver Cirrhosis, Biliary; Liver Diseases; Liver Transplantation; Malaysia; Male; Retrospective Studies; Singapore; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85055447898

The habitats were forest edge, playground area, longhouse, oil palm plantation and shrub-bushes area. Sampling of Anopheles was done monthly using the human landing catch method in all habitat types for 14 months (October 2013 to December 2014, excluding June 2014). The Anopheles species were morphologically identified and subjected to PCR assay for the detection of Plasmodium parasites. Generalised linear mixed models (GLMM) were applied to test the variation in abundance and biting rates of An. balabacensis in different habitat types. Results: A total of 1599 Anopheles specimens were collected in the village, of which about 90% were An. balabacensis. Anopheles balabacensis was present throughout the year and was the dominant Anopheles species in all habitat types. The shrub bushes habitat had the highest Anopheles species diversity while forest edge had the greatest number of Anopheles individuals caught. GLMM analysis indicated that An. balabacensis abundance was not affected by the type of habitats, and it was more active during the early and late night compared to predawn and dawn. PCR assay showed that 1.61% of the tested An. balabacensis were positive for malaria parasites, most of which were caught in oil palm estates and infected with one to two Plasmodium species. Conclusions: The identification of infected vectors in a range of habitats, including agricultural and farming areas, illustrates the potential for humans to be exposed to P. knowlesi outside forested areas. This finding contributes to a growing body of evidence implicating environmental changes due to deforestation, expansion of agricultural and farming areas, and development of human settlements near to forest fringes in the emergence of P. knowlesi in Sabah. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Abundance; Anopheles balabacensis; Biting time; Habitat type; Malaria vector; Malaysia; Plasmodium knowlesi; Sabah,palm oil; agricultural land; animal experiment; animal tissue; Anopheles; Anopheles balabacensis; Article; controlled study; deforestation; environmental management; forest; mosquito bite; nonhuman; parasite identification; Plasmodium knowlesi; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; Sabah; shrub; species diversity; species habitat; species identification; animal; Anopheles; ecosystem; insect bite; isolation and purification; malaria; Malaysia; mosquito vector; parasitology; physiology; statistical model; Animals; Anopheles; Ecosystem; Forests; Insect Bites and Stings; Linear Models; Malaria; Malaysia; Mosquito Vectors; Plasmodium knowlesi,2-s2.0-85069925097

Among the wide array of polymers, chitosan has received growing interest among researchers. It was widely used as a vehicle in polymeric nanoparticles for drug targeting. This review explored the current research on the antimicrobial activity of chitosan nanoparticles (ChNP) and the impact on the clinical applications. The antimicrobial activities of ChNP were widely reported against bacteria, fungi, yeasts and algae, in both in vivo and in vitro studies. For pharmaceutical applications, ChNP were used as antimicrobial coating for promoting wound healing, preventing infections and combating the rise of infectious disease. Besides, ChNP also exhibited significant inhibitory activities on foodborne microorganisms, particularly on fruits and vegetables. It is noteworthy that ChNP can be also applied to deliver antimicrobial drugs, which further enhance the efficiency and stability of the antimicrobial agent.

Design A systematic review was conducted using electronic databases of CINAHL, PubMed, PsychINFO, Psychology and Behavioural Sciences Collection, SocINDEX and Web of Science for articles published until the 11th of January 2018. Eligibility criteria All observational studies investigating the association between social support and depression among community-dwelling older adults in Asia were included. Participants Older adults aged 60 years and more who are living in the community. Exposure measures Social support. Outcome measures Depression. Results We retrieved16 356 records and screened 66 full-text articles. Twenty-four observational studies were included in the review. They consisted of five cohort studies and 19 cross-sectional studies. Social support was found to be measured by multiple components, most commonly through a combination of structural and functional constructs. Perceived social support is more commonly measured compared with received social support. Good overall social support, having a spouse or partner, living with family, having a large social network, having more contact with family and friends, having emotional and instrumental support, good support from family and satisfaction with social support are associated with less depressive symptoms among community-dwelling older adults in Asia. Conclusions There were 20 different social support measures and we applied a framework to allow for better comparability. Our findings emphasised the association between good social support and decrease depression among older adults. Compared with western populations, family support has a greater influence on depression among community-dwelling older adults in Asia. This indicates that the family institution needs to be incorporated into designed programmes and interventions when addressing depression in the Asian context.

Thus, this study aimed to investigate the effects of capsaicin on ORL-48, an oral cancer cell line of Asian origin. Materials and Methods: Morphological changes of the ORL-48 cells treated with capsaicin were analyzed using fluorescence microscopy. The apoptotic-inducing activity of capsaicin was further confirmed by Annexin V-Fluorescein isothiocyanate/Propidium iodide (V-FITC/PI) staining using flow cytometry. In order to establish the pathway of apoptosis triggered by the compound on ORL-48 cells, caspase activity was determined and the mitochondrial pathway was verified by mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) assay. Cell cycle analysis was also performed to identify the cell cycle phase of ORL-48 cells being inhibited by the capsaicin compound. Results: Fluorescence microscopy exhibited the presence of apoptotic features in capsaicin-treated ORL-48 cells. Apoptosis of capsaicin-treated ORL-48 cells revealed disruption of the mitochondrial-membrane potential, activation of caspase-3,-7 and-9 through an intrinsic apoptotic pathway and subsequently, apoptotic DNA fragmentation. The cell cycle arrest occurred in the G1-phase, confirming antiproliferative effect of capsaicin in a time-dependent manner. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that capsaicin is cytotoxic against ORL-48 cells and induces apoptosis in ORL-48 cells possibly through mitochondria mediated intrinsic pathway resulting in cell cycle arrest. ? 2019 by the authors.",Antiproliferative; Antitumor; Apoptosis; Cancer; Capsaicin; Oral,"capsaicin; growth inhibitor; apoptosis; Asian continental ancestry group; cell line; drug effect; genetics; human; pathology; squamous cell carcinoma; Apoptosis; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Capsaicin; Cell Line; Growth Inhibitors; Humans; Neoplasms, Squamous Cell",2-s2.0-85069260948

This review addresses the acceptability of HPV DNA testing using self-sampling compared with conventional clinician-collected sampling. Barriers to and others factors associated with acceptability of either method were also examined. Methods The following electronic resources were searched: Medline @EBSCOHOST(Medline), Embase, PubMed, and CINAHL databases. Manual searches were also conducted. The main outcome of interest was the acceptability of HPV DNA testing by self-sampling in comparison with clinician-collected sampling. Results In total, 23 articles were included in this systematic review. The majority (19 studies) were quantitative intervention studies and 4 studies were qualitative observational studies. Eleven studies reported a preference for self-sampling by women compared with clinician-collected sampling (64.7%-93%). The remaining studies found that women preferred clinician-collected sampling because mainly of respondents' lack of confidence in their ability to complete self-sampling correctly. In most articles reviewed, the studied associated factors, such as demographic factors (age, marital status, and ethnicity), socioeconomic factors (income, education level), reproductive factors (condom use, number of children, current use of contraception, and number of partners), and habits (smoking status) were not found to be significantly associated with preference. Conclusions Both methods of sampling were found to be acceptable to women. Self-sampling is cost-effective and could increase the screening coverage among underscreened populations. However, more information about the quality, reliability, and accuracy of self-sampling is needed to increase women's confidence about using to this method. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.",acceptability; HPV DNA testing; PAP smear; systematic review; women self-sampling,"age; child; Cinahl; clinician; condom use; contraception; controlled study; disease course; education; Embase; ethnicity; female; habit; human; human experiment; human tissue; intervention study; marriage; Medline; nonhuman; observational study; outcome assessment; Papanicolaou test; reliability; review; sampling; smoking; socioeconomics; systematic review; Wart virus; adolescent; adult; aged; comparative study; isolation and purification; mass screening; middle aged; Papillomaviridae; papillomavirus infection; patient attitude; procedures; self examination; specimen handling; very elderly; young adult; virus DNA; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; DNA, Viral; Female; Humans; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Papillomaviridae; Papillomavirus Infections; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Self-Examination; Specimen Handling; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85067552709

Its uncontrollable passage among the natural monkey hosts can potentially lead to zoonotic outbreaks. The merozoite of this parasite invades host erythrocytes through interaction between its erythrocyte-binding proteins (EBPs) and their respective receptor on the erythrocytes. The region II of P. knowlesi EBP, P. knowlesi beta (Pk β II) protein is found to be mediating merozoite invasion into monkey erythrocytes by interacting with sialic acid receptors. Hence, the objective of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity, natural selection and haplotype grouping of Pk β II of P. knowlesi isolates in Malaysia. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications of Pk β II were performed on archived blood samples from Malaysia and 64 Pk β II sequences were obtained. Sequence analysis revealed length polymorphism, and its amino acids at critical residues indicate the ability of Pk β II to mediate P. knowlesi invasion into monkey erythrocytes. Low genetic diversity (π = 0.007) was observed in the Pk β II of Malaysia Borneo compared to Peninsular Malaysia (π = 0.015). The Pk β II was found to be under strong purifying selection to retain infectivity in monkeys and it plays a limited role in the zoonotic potential of P. knowlesi. Its haplotypes could be clustered into Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysia Borneo groups, indicating the existence of two distinct P. knowlesi parasites in Malaysia as reported in an earlier study. ? 2019, Indian Academy of Sciences.",beta protein; genetic diversity; haplotypes; natural selection; Plasmodium knowlesi,,2-s2.0-85067350476

Depression literacy can improve mental health outcomes. The aim of this study was to collate and analyse the extant evidence on depression literacy among adolescents, with particular focus on tools used to examine depression literacy and the findings on components of depression literacy. Methods: Nine electronic databases and 1 grey literature source were searched for studies published in English between January 2006 and December 2018 and involving adolescents aged 10–19 years. We included studies that reported on components of depression literacy such as knowledge, help-seeking and stigmatising attitudes. We excluded qualitative studies. Two independent reviewers verified that the studies met the inclusion criteria, assessed the quality of the studies and extracted their characteristics. The data were descriptively analysed and appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), Cochrane Collaboration's tool and the Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies (QATSQ). Results and conclusion: Fifty of the 14,626 references identified met the inclusion criteria. Depression literacy was most commonly (58%) assessed using tools that utilize a vignette-based methodology. A lack of uniformity in reporting of depression literacy was noted. Adolescents were poor at recognising depression, likely to seek help from informal sources and tended to attach stigma to depression. The implications of the findings are discussed and suggestions made for future research. ? 2019 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents",Adolescent; Depression; Help-seeking; Knowledge; Mental health literacy; Stigma,adolescent; Adolescent Depression Knowledge Questionnaire; attitude to health; awareness; child psychiatry; clinical outcome; community mental health center; depression; depression assessment; Depression Stigma Scale; General Help seeking Questionnaire; health literacy; help seeking behavior; human; knowledge; medical education; mental health; Newcastle-Ottawa scale; psychotherapy; quality assessment tool; Review; social stigma; systematic review,2-s2.0-85067286770

There are many challenges that a regional journal faces. The number of printed journals is beginning to decline. Digital publishing and extensive databases and search engines have become the only practical way to access data. But the advent of digital publishing has seen the arrival of profit-making entrepreneurs. Whether a Journal is in the printed form or digital, it remains the key communication in public health and ultimately improve the health of the people. The Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health (APJPH), which is owned by Asia Pacific Academic Consortium for Public Health (APACPH) and published by Sage ensures that your data gets maximum digital exposure in the region where it can make a difference. Over the years, APJPH has increased its impact factor and gained in prestige.

Method: A cross-sectional survey was completed by national representatives in all ASEAN countries (Brunei, Cambodia, East Timor, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam). Results: Overall facilities for initial epilepsy pre-surgical evaluation are available in most countries, but further non-invasive and invasive investigations are limited. Three countries (Brunei, Cambodia, and East Timor) have no epilepsy center, and 2 countries (Laos, Myanmar) have level 2 centers doing tumor surgery only. Level-3 epilepsy centers are available in 6 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippine, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam); only 5 countries (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippine, Singapore, Thailand) has at least one level-4 epilepsy care facility. Indonesia with 261 million population only has one level 3 and another level 4 center. The costs of presurgical evaluation and brain surgery vary within and among the countries. The main barriers towards epilepsy surgery in ASEAN include lack of expertise, funding and facilities.

Idiopathic intracranial hypertension is characterized by signs of raised intracranial pressure occurring in the absence of cerebral pathology, with normal composition of cerebrospinal fluid and a raised opening pressure of more than 20 cmH2O during lumbar puncture. We aim to report a rare case of acute ophthalmoplegia with co-occurrence of raised intracranial pressure. Case Description: A 28-year-old gentleman with body mass index of 34.3 was referred to us for management of double vision of 2 weeks duration. His symptom started after a brief episode of upper respiratory tract infection. His best corrected visual acuity was 6/6 OU. He had bilateral sixth nerve palsy worse on the left eye and bilateral hypometric saccade. His deep tendon reflexes were found to be hyporeflexic in all four limbs. No sensory or motor power deficit was detected, and his gait was normal. Plantar reflexes were downwards bilaterally and cerebellar examination was normal. Both optic discs developed hyperaemia and swelling. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain was normal and lumbar puncture revealed an opening pressure of 50 cmH2O. Anti-GQ1b IgG and anti-GT1a IgG antibody were tested positive. Conclusion: Acute ophthalmoparesis without ataxia can present with co-occurrence of raised intracranial pressure.

The objective of this study was to identify possible factors associated with anemia among pre-school children in Bangladesh after removing a cluster effect of the population, and to determine the prevalence of this condition. Methods: Data for this study was extracted from the 2011 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS-2011). In this survey, data was collected using a two-stage stratified cluster sampling approach. The chi-square test and a two-level logistic regression model were used for further analysis. Results: Data from 2231 children aged 6-59 months were included for analysis. The prevalence of child anemia was noted to be 52.10%. Among these anemic children, 48.40% where from urban environment and 53.90% were from rural areas. The prevalence of mild, moderate and severe anemia among children was 57.10, 41.40 and 1.50% respectively. The two-level logistic regression model revealed that the following factors were associated with childhood anemia: children of anemic mothers (p < 0.01), undernourished children (p < 0.05), younger children (age < 2 years) (p < 0.01) and children from poor family (p < 0.05). Lastly, anemia was more common among children living in Barisal and Rangpur divisions compared to those from Dhaka division (p < 0.01), and among non-Muslims than Muslim (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Our study showed that prevalence of anemia among pre-school children in Bangladesh was very high (52.10%). We noted that young children of anemic mothers, from poor families, and being undernourished were at higher risk of developing anemia. Since most of these risk factors were related to socioeconomic conditions, they were potentially modifiable. Therefore, our findings may be useful for the health authorities to identify children at risk for remedial action and to plan for preventive measures. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Anemia; Bangladesh; Multilevel regression; Pre-school children; Prevalence,adult; age distribution; anemia; Article; Bangladesh; chi square test; child; controlled study; data extraction; demography; disease severity; female; geographic distribution; health survey; human; infant; information processing; logistic regression analysis; major clinical study; male; malnutrition; Muslim; parental behavior; population research; preschool child; prevalence; risk factor; rural area; sampling; socioeconomics; urban area,2-s2.0-85068460845

This study aims to investigate the mutations in the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) conferring pyrethroid resistance against Ae. aegypti populations from Indonesia. Molecular genotyping of mutations using polymerase chain reaction assay and direct DNA sequencing were performed at positions 989 and 1,016 in IIS6 region, and 1,534 in IIIS6 region of the voltage-gated sodium channel (Vgsc) in nine populations of Indonesian Ae. aegypti. The V1016G and S989P genotyping identified the RR genotype to be predominant in six out of nine populations of Ae. aegypti, whereas the SS genotype occurred only in minority. Interestingly, co-occurrence of the V1016G and S989P mutations was detected in the aforementioned six populations with high frequency. Genotyping of F1534C showed all nine populations exhibited the SS genotype, with merely two individuals from a population were heterozygous (RS). Significant correlations were demonstrated between the allele frequencies of the V1016G mutation and the survivability rates as well as resistance ratios in pyrethroid adult bioassays. This signifies the V1016G can contribute more to the insensitivity of Vgsc than the F1534C. Homozygous 1016G mosquitoes were likelier to survive pyrethroid exposure. Identification of underlying mechanisms resulting in insecticide resistance is advantageous in developing effective mosquito control programs in Indonesia. ? The Author(s) 2019.

As an antagonist to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), ranibizumab works by binding and neutralizing all active VEGF-A, thus limiting progressive cell growth and proliferation. Ranibizumab application in ocular diseases has shown remarkable desired effects; however, to date, its antifibrotic mechanism is not well understood. In this study, we identified metabolic changes in ranibizumab-treated human Tenon's fibroblasts (HTFs). Cultured HTFs were treated for 48 h with 0.5 mg/mL of ranibizumab and 0.5 mg/mL control IgG antibody which serves as a negative control. Samples from each group were injected into Agilent 6520 Q-TOF liquid chromatography/mass spectrometer (LC/MS) system to establish the metabolite expression in both ranibizumab treated cells and control group. Data obtained was analyzed using Agilent Mass Hunter Qualitative Analysis software to identify the most regulated metabolite following ranibizumab treatment. At p-value < 0.01 with the cut off value of two-fold change, 31 identified metabolites were found to be significantly upregulated in ranibizumab-treated group, with six of the mostly upregulated having insignificant role in fibroblast cell cycle and wound healing regulations. Meanwhile, 121 identified metabolites that were downregulated, and seven of the mostly downregulated are significantly involved in cell cycle and proliferation. Our findings suggest that ranibizumab abrogates the tissue scarring and wound healing process by regulating the expression of metabolites associated with fibrotic activity. In particular, we found that vitamin Bs are important in maintaining normal folate cycle, nucleotide synthesis, and homocysteine and spermidine metabolism.

To date, no questionnaire that specifically assesses the health-related quality of life of patients with chronic kidney disease has been validated in Malaysia. Malay is the national language of Malaysia and spoken by the majority of its citizens. Therefore, the aim of our study was to cross-culturally adapt and validate the Malay Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 (KDQOL-36) among patients with chronic kidney disease. Methods: The English version of the KDQOL-36 was translated according to international guidelines to Malay. Content validity was verified by an expert panel and piloted in five patients. Our instrument was then administered to patients with chronic kidney disease stage 1-3A and patients on hemodialysis at baseline and 4 weeks later. Results: A total of 181/232 patients agreed to participate (response rate = 78.0%). The majority were male (69.6%) with a median age of 51.0 years. Exploratory factor analysis found that the KDQOL-36 had three domains. All three domains showed low to moderate correlation (Spearman's Rho = 0.297-0.610) with the Europe Quality of Life Five Dimension questionnaire. Patients on hemodialysis (physical component summary = 39.8; mental component summary = 53.1;burden of disease = 37.5; symptoms/burden list = 75.0; effects of kidney disease on daily life = 68.8) had significantly worse quality of life than patients with chronic kidney disease stage 1-3A (physical component summary = 49.9; mental component summary = 52.9; burden of disease = 75.0; symptoms/burden list = 85.4; effects of kidney disease on daily life = 93.8, p < 0.001) except for the mental component summary. This indicates that the Malay KDQOL-36 has achieved adequate known-groups validity. Cronbach alpha ranged from 0.872-0.901, indicating adequate internal consistency. At retest, intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0.584-0.902, indicating moderate to good correlation. Conclusion: The Malay Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36 was found to be a valid and reliable tool to assess the quality of life in patients with chronic kidney disease. This tool can now be used to assess the health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in patients with chronic kidney disease, as HRQOL is an important independent predictor of patient outcome. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Hemodialysis; Kidney disease quality of life; Malay; Reliability; health related quality of life; Validity,adaptation; adult; aged; Article; chronic kidney failure; clinical assessment tool; content validity; controlled study; cultural anthropology; disease burden; Europe Quality of Life Five Dimension questionnaire; exploratory factor analysis; female; hemodialysis; human; internal consistency; major clinical study; Malay (language); Malay Kidney Disease Quality of Life-36; male; medical expert; middle aged; practice guideline; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; symptom; validation study,2-s2.0-85067551148

To facilitate this development, there is a significant growth of biobanks in the country to ensure continuous collection of biological samples for future research, which contain extremely important personal information and health data of the participants involved. Given the vast amount of samples and data accumulated by biobanks, they can be considered as reservoirs of precious biomedical big data. It is therefore imperative for biobanks to have in place regulatory measures to ensure ethical use of the biomedical big data. Malaysia has yet to introduce specific legislation for the field of biobanking. However, it can be argued that its existing Personal Data Protection Act 2010 (PDPA) has laid down legal principles that can be enforced to protect biomedical big data generated by the biobanks. Consent is a mechanism to enable data subjects to exercise their autonomy by determining how their data can be used and ensure compliance with legal principles. However, there are two main concerns surrounding the current practice of consent in biomedical big data in Malaysia. First, it is uncertain that the current practice would be able to respect the underlying notion of autonomy, and second, it is not in accordance with the legal principles of the PDPA.

However, the possible underlying mechanisms of cell death as a response to FKC treatment remains unclear. In this study, we performed proteomic analysis of HCT 116 cells treated with FKC to identify proteins that change in abundance. This was followed by bioinformatic analysis to predict possible associated molecular targets or pathways involved in the observed effects of FKC. A total of 35 proteins that changed in abundance (17 increased and 18 decreased) were identified through two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS). Using the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA), these proteins were predicted to be involved in cell death and survival, cell cycle, cellular growth and proliferation, protein synthesis, post-translational modification and amino acid metabolism by. Further analysis of the transcript levels of selected proteins using qPCR showed that some of the genes exhibited similar change of profile to that of the proteins'. Our results have provided novel insights into the potential molecular mechanisms underlying FKC-induced apoptosis or cell death in colon cancer cells. ? 2019",Chalcone; Colon cancer cells; Flavokawain C; Potential anti-cancer; Proteomics,amino acid; chalcone derivative; flavokawain C; messenger RNA; unclassified drug; chalcone derivative; flavokawain C; amino acid metabolism; apoptosis; Article; bioinformatics; cell cycle; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell survival; controlled study; drug mechanism; HCT 116 cell line; human; human cell; image analysis; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; molecular mechanics; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; protein analysis; protein processing; protein synthesis; proteomics; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; cell death; drug effect; HCT 116 cell line; signal transduction; Cell Death; Chalcones; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Proteomics; Signal Transduction,2-s2.0-85064620088

It results in accumulation of the glycosaminoglycans, keratan sulfate and chondroitin-6-sulfate, leading to skeletal and other systemic impairments. Data on MPS IVA in Asian populations are scarce. Methods: This is a multicentre descriptive case series of 21 patients comprising all MPS IVA patients in Malaysia. Mutational analysis was performed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the GALNS gene in 17 patients. Results: The patients (15 females and 6 males) had a mean age (± SD) of 15.5 (± 8.1) years. Mean age at symptom onset was 2.6 (± 2.1) years and at confirmed diagnosis was 6.9 (± 4.5) years. The study cohort included patients from all the main ethnic groups in Malaysia - 57% Malay, 29% Chinese and 14% Indian. Common presenting symptoms included pectus carinatum (57%) and genu valgum (43%). Eight patients (38%) had undergone surgery, most commonly knee surgeries (29%) and cervical spine decompression (24%). Patients had limited endurance with lower mean walking distances with increasing age. GALNS gene analysis identified 18 distinct mutations comprising 13 missense, three nonsense, one small deletion and one splice site mutation. Of these, eight were novel mutations (Tyr133Ser, Glu158Valfs?12, Gly168?, Gly168Val, Trp184?, Leu271Pro, Glu320Lys, Leu508Pro). Mutations in exons 1, 5 and 9 accounted for 51% of the mutant alleles identified. Conclusions: All the MPS IVA patients in this study had clinical impairments. A better understanding of the natural history and the clinical and genetic spectrum of MPS IVA in this population may assist early diagnosis, improve management and permit timely genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Diagnosis; GALNS; Malaysia; Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA; Natural history,glutamine; glycine; leucine; lysine; n acetylgalactosamine 6 sulfatase; proline; serine; tryptophan; tyrosine; valine; adolescent; adult; allele; Article; biochemical analysis; child; Chinese; clinical article; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; endurance; exon; female; GALNS gene; gene deletion; gene identification; genetic counseling; human; Indian; knee surgery; Malay (people); Malaysia; male; missense mutation; Morquio A syndrome; Morquio syndrome; mutational analysis; nonsense mutation; onset age; pigeon thorax; polymerase chain reaction; prenatal diagnosis; retrospective study; RNA splice site; Sanger sequencing; spinal cord decompression; valgus knee,2-s2.0-85067276083

The MIRD5 adult female anthropomorphic phantom, readily available in the Geant4 Monte Carlo package was used. However, the left breast was modified from 195 to 145 cm3, to represent a breast following lumpectomy. Left breast was chosen due to its higher cancer occurrence than the right breast. The HDR sources were constructed with an outer cylindrical dimension of 4.5 mm (length) × 0.9 mm (diameter). Various influencing parameters were studied, i.e. catheter arrangement (single versus dual plane), source inter-dwell distances (5 versus 10 mm), and different radionuclides, i.e. Cobalt-60 (60Co) and 192Ir, by delivering a total treatment dose of 32 Gy to the left breast. Absorbed doses to the OARs (e.g. left lung, heart, right breast, spleen, etc.) were then evaluated. A maximum left lung dose of 1.5 Gy was recorded, while doses to the other OARs were all below 1 Gy. The treatment using dual plane catheter arrangement contributed to a slightly higher dose to the OARs, despite equal dose to the breast. There was no dose difference between different inter-dwell distances used in this study. 60Co resulted in a slightly higher left lung dose than that of 192Ir, while the results were the opposite for the other OARs. HDR brachytherapy allows high dose to be delivered to the breast within a short period of time, with minimal absorbed doses to the OARs. ?

To address this, here we apply a novel strategy to integrate gene expression profiles across 32 cancer types, and cluster human lncRNAs based on their pan-cancer protein-coding gene associations. By doing so, we derive 16 lncRNA modules whose unique properties allow simultaneous inference of function, disease specificity and regulation for over 800 lncRNAs. Results: Remarkably, modules could be grouped into just four functional themes: transcription regulation, immunological, extracellular, and neurological, with module generation frequently driven by lncRNA tissue specificity. Notably, three modules associated with the extracellular matrix represented potential networks of lncRNAs regulating key events in tumour progression. These included a tumour-specific signature of 33 lncRNAs that may play a role in inducing epithelial-mesenchymal transition through modulation of TGFβ signalling, and two stromal-specific modules comprising 26 lncRNAs linked to a tumour suppressive microenvironment and 12 lncRNAs related to cancer-associated fibroblasts. One member of the 12-lncRNA signature was experimentally supported by siRNA knockdown, which resulted in attenuated differentiation of quiescent fibroblasts to a cancer-associated phenotype. Conclusions: Overall, the study provides a unique pan-cancer perspective on the lncRNA functional landscape, acting as a global source of novel hypotheses on lncRNA contribution to tumour progression. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cancer; Epithelial-mesenchymal transition; Extracellular matrix; Functional profiling; Genes networks; lncRNA; Tumour microenvironment,"long untranslated RNA; small interfering RNA; long untranslated RNA; messenger RNA; Article; cancer genetics; cancer growth; epithelial mesenchymal transition; extracellular matrix; fibroblast; gene expression profiling; gene function; gene knockdown; gene regulatory network; genetic association; genetic code; immune system; nervous system; phenotype; protein RNA binding; RNA analysis; stroma cell; TGF beta signaling; tissue specificity; transcription regulation; tumor microenvironment; biology; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetic association study; genetics; human; neoplasm; pathology; Computational Biology; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Gene Regulatory Networks; Genetic Association Studies; Humans; Neoplasms; RNA, Long Noncoding; RNA, Messenger; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85066824975

This study aims to determine the prevalence of anxiety and depression of patients with haematological cancers in Malaysia and to investigate the possible association of these psychological symptoms with their quality of life. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study where patients with haematological cancers attending two major hospitals were recruited. Anxiety and depression symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS). Quality of life (QoL) of these patients was measured using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire (EORTC QLQ C30). An overall summary QoL score in combination with financial difficulty score and global health score were used for analysis. Results: A total of 319 patients were recruited. Thirty-three percent of patients had anxiety symptoms, 23.5% had depression symptoms. In summary the overall score of QoL is significantly lower in patients with higher scores for depression and anxiety, (p<0.05). Patients who exhibit anxiety symptoms were more frequently female, still undergoing treatment whereas patients who had higher depression scores were older and had acute leukemias or myeloproliferative neoplasms. Patients who have depression are significantly associated with a higher financial difficulty score, p<0.05.

We ascertained the prevalence of endocrine dysfunction in children with TDT seen in a hospital setting in Malaysia. METHODS We reviewed all patients with TDT who had ? 8 blood transfusions per year. Patients who had a history of stem cell transplantation, concurrent autoimmune diseases or were newly diagnosed to have TDT were excluded. Standard diagnostic criteria were used in the diagnosis of various endocrine dysfunctions. RESULTS Of the 82 patients with TDT, 65% had at least one endocrine dysfunction. Short stature was the commonest (40.2%), followed by pubertal disorders (14.6%), hypoparathyroidism (12.3%), vitamin D deficiency (10.1%), hypocortisolism (7.3%), diabetes mellitus (5.2%) and overt hypothyroidism (4.9%). Subclinical hypothyroidism and pre-diabetes mellitus were seen in 13.4% and 8.6% of the patients, respectively. For children aged < 10 years, the prevalence of both thyroid dysfunction and hypoparathyroidism was 9.1%. CONCLUSION Two-thirds of children with TDT experienced at least one endocrine dysfunction. Thyroid dysfunction and hypoparathyroidism may be missed if endocrine screening is only performed in children with TDT > 10 years of age.

We examined the incidence, cost drivers, and factors associated with financial toxicity after cancer in an upper-middle-income country with universal health coverage. METHODS: Through the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Costs in Oncology study, 1,294 newly diagnosed patients with cancer (Ministry of Health [MOH] hospitals [n = 577], a public university hospital [n = 642], private hospitals [n = 75]) were observed in Malaysia. Cost diaries and questionnaires were used to measure incidence of financial toxicity, encompassing financial catastrophe (FC; out-of-pocket costs ? 30% of annual household income), medical impoverishment (decrease in household income from above the national poverty line to below that line after subtraction of cancer-related costs), and economic hardship (inability to make necessary household payments). Predictors of financial toxicity were determined using multivariable analyses. RESULTS: One fifth of patients had private health insurance. Incidence of FC at 1 year was 51% (MOH hospitals, 33%; public university hospital, 65%; private hospitals, 72%). Thirty-three percent of households were impoverished at 1 year. Economic hardship was reported by 47% of families. Risk of FC attributed to conventional medical care alone was 18% (MOH hospitals, 5%; public university hospital, 24%; private hospitals, 67%). Inclusion of expenditures on nonmedical goods and services inflated the risk of financial toxicity in public hospitals. Low-income status, type of hospital, and lack of health insurance were strong predictors of FC. CONCLUSION: Patients with cancer may not be fully protected against financial hardships, even in settings with universal health coverage.

In this study, we want to compare the exercise stress test tolerance using Bruce and Balke-Ware protocols. METHODS: This was a cross-over experimental study involving 30 male subjects aged 40 to 65 performing exercise stress test using Bruce and Balke-Ware protocols. Hemodynamic responses, electrocardiographic pattern and exercise duration were monitored during the test and the reason for termination was recorded. RESULTS: Bruce protocol achieved equivalent hemodynamic responses, completion rate and test findings to Balke-Ware (P>0.001). Over 50% of the subjects were able to complete the stress test using both protocols. 46.7% (N.=14) of subjects terminate the test prematurely for Bruce and 50% (N.=15) for Balke-Ware protocol. Fatigue was the commonest cause with (57.2% N.=8, 60% N.=9), followed by achieved target heart rate (35.5% N.=5, 33.3% N.=5) and shortness of breath (7.1% N.=1, 6.7% N.=1) for Bruce and Balke-Ware respectively. The exercise capacity (metabolic equivalent) attained during exercise was similar in both protocol (P>0.001), and exercise duration in Balke-Ware was significantly longer than the Bruce protocol (P<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: We found that protocol selection does not affect the completion rate and outcome of the exercise stress test and their tolerance was similar regardless of the protocols used. For Asian peoples who were unable to complete the exercise stress test due to any reasons, their cardiac status is best evaluated using other methods. ? 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.",Coronary artery disease; Electrocardiography; Exercise test; Exercise tolerance; Workload,adult; Article; balke ware protocol; breathing rate; bruce protocol; clinical article; comparative study; coronary artery disease; crossover procedure; diastolic blood pressure; dyspnea; electrocardiography; exercise; exercise test; exercise tolerance; experimental study; fatigue; follow up; heart muscle ischemia; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; Malaysian; male; mean arterial pressure; metabolic equivalent; normal human; outcome assessment; prematurity; resting heart rate; risk factor; stress; systolic blood pressure; treadmill exercise; treatment duration,2-s2.0-85067621839

DIO mice were treated with WFA (6 mg/kg) or rosiglitazone (10 mg/kg) for 8 weeks. At the end of the treatment period, metabolic profile, liver function and inflammatory parameters were obtained. Expression of selective genes controlling insulin signaling, inflammation, adipogenesis, energy expenditure and PPARγ phosphorylation-regulated genes in epididymal fats were analyzed. Furthermore, the anti-adipogenic effect of WFA was evaluated in 3T3- F442A cell line. WFA treatment prevented weight gain without affecting food or caloric intake in DIO mice. WFA-treated group also exhibited lower epididymal and mesenteric fat pad mass, an improvement in lipid profile and hepatic steatosis and a reduction in serum inflammatory cytokines. Insulin resistance was reduced as shown by an improvement in glucose and insulin tolerance and serum adiponectin. WFA treatment upregulated selective insulin signaling (insr, irs1, slc2a4 and pi3k) and PPARγ phosphorylation-regulated (car3, selenbp1, aplp2, txnip, and adipoq) genes, downregulated inflammatory (tnf-α and il-6) genes and altered energy expenditure controlling (tph2 and adrb3) genes. In 3T3- F442A cell line, withaferin A inhibited adipogenesis as indicated by a decrease in lipid accumulation in differentiating adipocytes and protein expression of PPARγ and C/EBPα. The effect of rosiglitazone on physiological and lipid profiles, insulin resistance, some genes expression and differentiating adipocytes were markedly different. Our data suggest that WFA is a promising therapeutic agent for both diabetes and obesity. ? 2019 Khalilpourfarshbafi et al.

Thematic analysis was used to identify, analyze, and report themes. Most participants investigated their HIV status after long period of sickness. Others sought testing upon partner’s diagnosis and some were diagnosed via blood donation. Barriers to testing include personal (perceived good health, fear of positive result, denial); social and structural factors (stigmatization by health providers and family, lack of information about free HIV testing and long wait time). Barriers to treatment comprise personal factors (perceived HIV as incurable and treatment as complicated), social factors (HIV and homosexual stigma), and cost. Promoting benefits of regular testing and early treatment is needed to improve HIV care continuum among MSM in Malaysia. ? 2019 The Guilford Press.",Barrier; HIV; Malaysia; Men who have sex with men; MSM; Test-and-treat,"adult; Article; awareness; clinical article; confidentiality; health behavior; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care policy; health insurance; help seeking behavior; homosexuality; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; interview; Malaysian; male; men who have sex with men; personal experience; prevalence; qualitative research; sexual behavior; social aspect; social support; stigma; teaching hospital; thematic analysis; young adult; attitude to health; fear; health personnel attitude; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; human relation; Malaysia; male homosexuality; mass screening; prejudice; psychology; sexuality; social stigma; stereotyping; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Fear; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Homosexuality, Male; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Interviews as Topic; Malaysia; Male; Mass Screening; Prejudice; Qualitative Research; Sexual Partners; Social Stigma; Stereotyping",2-s2.0-85067279730

Although the aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH2) polymorphism (rs671: Glu>Lys) has a strong effect on acetaldehyde metabolism, the association of rs671 with BC risk and its interaction with alcohol intake have not been fully elucidated. We conducted a pooled analysis of 14 case-control studies, with individual data on Asian ancestry women participating in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. Methods: We included 12,595 invasive BC cases and 12,884 controls for the analysis of rs671 and BC risk, and 2,849 invasive BC cases and 3,680 controls for the analysis of the gene-environment interaction between rs671 and alcohol intake for BC risk. The pooled odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) associated with rs671 and its interaction with alcohol intake for BC risk were estimated using logistic regression models. Results: The Lys/Lys genotype of rs671 was associated with increased BC risk (OR?=?1.16, 95% CI 1.03–1.30, p?=?0.014). According to tumor characteristics, the Lys/Lys genotype was associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive BC (OR?=?1.19, 95% CI 1.05–1.36, p?=?0.008), progesterone receptor (PR)-positive BC (OR?=?1.19, 95% CI 1.03–1.36, p?=?0.015), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative BC (OR?=?1.25, 95% CI 1.05–1.48, p?=?0.012). No evidence of a gene-environment interaction was observed between rs671 and alcohol intake (p?=?0.537). Conclusion: This study suggests that the Lys/Lys genotype confers susceptibility to BC risk among women of Asian ancestry, particularly for ER-positive, PR-positive, and HER2-negative tumor types. ? 2019 The Authors.

Methods: Data on highest education attained were gathered for 459,170 participants (70% women) from 10 European countries. A relative index of inequality (RII) based on adult education was calculated for comparability across countries and generations. Cox regression models were applied to estimate relative inequality in pancreatic cancer risk, stratifying by age, gender, and center, and adjusting for known pancreatic cancer risk factors. Results: A total of 1,223 incident pancreatic cancer cases were included after a mean follow-up of 13.9 (4.0) years. An inverse social trend was found in models adjusted for age, sex, and center for both sexes [HR of RII, 1.27; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.02-1.59], which was also significant among women (HR, 1.42; 95% CI, 1.05-1.92). Further adjusting by smoking intensity, alcohol consumption, body mass index, prevalent diabetes, and physical activity led to an attenuation of the RII risk and loss of statistical significance. Conclusions: The present reanalysis does not sustain the existence of an independent social inequality influence on pancreatic cancer risk in Western European women and men, using an index based on adult education, the most relevant social indicator linked to individual lifestyles, in a context of very low pancreatic cancer survival from (quasi) universal public health systems. Impact: The results do not support an association between education and risk of pancreatic cancer. ? 2019 American Association for Cancer Research.",,somatomedin binding protein 3; somatomedin C; adult; adult education; age; alcohol consumption; Article; body mass; cancer risk; cohort analysis; diabetes mellitus; family history; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; pancreas cancer; physical activity; priority journal; risk factor; sex difference; smoking; social status; socioeconomics; Western Europe,2-s2.0-85067195833

Following a European survey, the European Society for Medical Oncology, the European Society for Paediatric Oncology and the Asian continental branch of International Society of Paediatric Oncology undertook a similar survey to assess AYA cancer care across Asia. Methods A link to the online survey was sent to healthcare professionals (HCPs) in Asia interested in AYA cancer care. Questions covered the demographics and training of HCPs, their understanding of AYA definition, availability and access to specialised AYA services, the support and advice offered during and after treatment, and factors of treatment non-compliance. Results We received 268 responses from 22 Asian countries. There was a striking variation in the definition of AYA (median lower age 15 years, median higher age 29 years). The majority of the respondents (78%) did not have access to specialised cancer services and 73% were not aware of any research initiatives for AYA. Over two-thirds (69%) had the option to refer their patients for psychological and/or nutritional support and most advised their patients on a healthy lifestyle. Even so, 46% did not ask about smokeless tobacco habits and only half referred smokers to a smoking cessation service. Furthermore, 29% did not promote human papillomavirus vaccination for girls and 17% did not promote hepatitis B virus vaccination for high-risk individuals. In terms of funding, 69% reported governmental insurance coverage, although 65% reported that patients self-paid, at least partially. Almost half (47%) reported treatment non-compliance or abandonment as an issue, attributed to financial and family problems (72%), loss of follow-up (74%) and seeking of alternative treatments (77%).

The radiological parameters measured on preoperative CT scan were: Aortic-Vertebral Distance (AVD), Entry-Aortic Distance (EAD), Aortic-Vertebral angle (AVA), Pedicle Aorta angle/Aortic Alpha angle (α angle), and Aortic Beta angle (β angle).Results.Thirty-nine patients were recruited. Significant moderate to strong positive correlation was found between AVD and Cobb angle from T8 to T12 vertebrae (r=0.360 to 0.666). The EAD was generally small in the thoracic region (T4-T10) with mean EAD of less than 30mm. Among all apical vertebrae, the mean AVD was 5.9±2.2mm with significant moderate-strong positive correlation to Cobb angle (r=0.580). The mean α angle was 37.7±8.7° with significant weak positive correlation with Cobb angle (r=0.325).Conclusion.The larger the scoliotic curve, the aorta was located further away from the apical vertebral wall. The aorta has less risk of injury from the left lateral pedicle screw breach in larger scoliotic curve at the apical region. The distance from the pedicle screw entry point to the wall of the aorta was generally small (less than 30mm) in the thoracic region (T4-T10).Level of Evidence: 4. ? 2019 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Although ADR reporting by healthcare providers in Malaysia is increasing, few ADR reports are submitted by community pharmacists. Aim: This study assessed the knowledge, attitudes and practice of ADR reporting, as well as barriers and facilitators of ADR reporting, among community pharmacists in Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional 52-item validated questionnaire was distributed to 278 community pharmacists in Selangor, Malaysia, in 2015. Multistage sampling was performed whereby community pharmacists from three of the nine administrative districts in the region were eligible for inclusion. Community pharmacies were then randomly sampled from the selected districts. Data are reported using descriptive statistics. Results: A total of 219 pharmacists responded to the survey, giving a response rate of 78.8%. These community pharmacists self-reported a positive attitude towards ADR reporting. Nevertheless, less than half (34.2%; n?=?75) had previously reported an ADR. Lack of information provided by the patient, insufficient clinical knowledge and uncertainty relating to the association between the adverse reaction and the drug were the main barriers to ADR reporting. Conclusions: The attitude and practices among community pharmacists indicates there is room for improvement in ADR reporting in Malaysia. Ongoing education and training on ADR reporting for community pharmacists is required to ensure delivery of high-quality care to the community. ? 2019 The Society of Hospital Pharmacists of Australia",attitude; community pharmacists; knowledge; practices; spontaneous reporting system,adult; adverse drug reaction; Article; community pharmacist; controlled study; cross-sectional study; drug industry; drug surveillance program; female; health care personnel; health survey; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; pharmacist attitude; pharmacovigilance; pharmacy (shop); practice guideline; professional knowledge; uncertainty,2-s2.0-85066483267

Cell lines enable the in vitro investigation of molecular and genetic changes leading to renal carcinogenesis and are important for evaluating cellular drug response or toxicity. This study details a fast and easy protocol of establishing epithelial and fibroblast cell cultures or cell lines concurrently from renal cancer nephrectomy tissue. The protocol involves mechanical disaggregation, collagenase digestion and cell sieving for establishing epithelial cells while fibroblast cells were grown from explants. This protocol has been modified from previous published reports with additional antibiotics and washing steps added to eliminate microbial contamination from the surgical source. Cell characterisation was carried out using immunofluorescence and quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Eleven stable epithelial renal tumour cell lines of various subtypes, including rare subtypes, were established with a spontaneous immortalisation rate of 21.6% using this protocol. Eight fibroblast cell cultures grew successfully but did not achieve spontaneous immortalisation. Cells of epithelial origin expressed higher expressions of epithelial markers such as pan-cytokeratin, cytokeratin 8 and E-cadherin whereas fibroblast cells expressed high α-smooth muscle actin.

Based on molecular docking studies, compound 1 docked in a non-active site of both enzymes. The dual inhibitory activity of compound 1 makes it a suitable natural alternative in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. ? 2019 Wiley-VHCA AG, Zurich, Switzerland",Alpinia pahangensis; bis-labdanic diterpene; dual inhibitor; pahangensin A; α-amylase; α-glucosidase,acarbose; alpha glucosidase; alpha glucosidase inhibitor; amylase; amylase inhibitor; diterpene; pahangensin A; unclassified drug; diterpene; enzyme inhibitor; plant extract; Alpinia; Alpinia pahangensis; Article; enzyme inhibition; hydrogen bond; IC50; molecular docking; nonhuman; Alpinia; antagonists and inhibitors; binding site; chemistry; enzyme active site; isolation and purification; kinetics; metabolism; alpha-Amylases; alpha-Glucosidases; Alpinia; Binding Sites; Catalytic Domain; Diterpenes; Enzyme Inhibitors; Kinetics; Molecular Docking Simulation; Plant Extracts,2-s2.0-85065651112

The objective of this study was to determine the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of colistin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) isolated from swine samples in Malaysia. Methods: A total of 46 swine K. pneumoniae strains isolated from 2013–2015 in Malaysia were analysed for the production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases and carbapenemase. The resistance traits and genetic diversity of these strains were characterised by polymerase chain reaction, conjugation, plasmid analysis, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. Results: Nineteen of 46 strains were multidrug resistant while 13 were resistant to colistin. The majority of colistin-resistant strains harboured blaTEM gene (92.3%), followed by blaSHV (69.23%), blaCTXM-1 (38.46%), and blaMCR-1 (23.08%). All three colistin-resistant strains had transferable plasmids and the colistin resistance gene blaMCR-1. Genotyping by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed high genetic diversity among the K. pneumoniae and that the colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae strains were heterogenous. Conclusion: It is believed that this is the first report of colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae among swine strains associated with mcr-1 plasmid in Malaysia. Due to the emergence of β-lactam, carbapenem and colistin resistance, the use of colistin in animal husbandry and agriculture should be avoided to prevent treatment failure. ? 2019 International Society for Chemotherapy of Infection and Cancer",Colistin; Genetic diversity; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Multidrug resistance; Swine,amikacin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; ampicillin; aztreonam; beta lactamase; beta lactamase CTX M; beta lactamase MCR 1; beta lactamase SHV; beta lactamase TEM; carbapenemase; cefoperazone; cefotaxime; ceftazidime; ciprofloxacin; colistin; gentamicin; imipenem; meropenem; nalidixic acid; penicillinase; tazobactam; tetracycline; unclassified drug; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bacterial strain; bacterium isolation; colistin resistance; controlled study; genetic variability; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Malaysia; nonhuman; pig; plasmid; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; pulsed field gel electrophoresis,2-s2.0-85065395364

Highly popular and forming a staple part of the diet in North Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and West Asia, palm dates growing naturally there have even greater marketability than simple satisfaction of domestic demand, the palm dates representing a valuable export item. Accurate knowledge of the levels of natural radioactivity in the fruit is thus of importance. In this study, using high-purity germanium gamma-ray spectrometry, quantification has been made of natural radionuclide concentrations in imported dates originating from Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Tunisia. Sample analyses reveal respective mean activity concentrations of 1.4 ± 0.3, 0.8 ± 0.4, and 186 ± 9 Bq kg-1 dry weight for 226Ra, 228Ra, and 40K. For each nuclide, the mean concentration varies little between the dates of the three represented regions. The estimated committed effective dose resulting from the consumption of date fruits for a typical adult was found to be 29.9 μSv y-1, well below the global internal dose of 290 μSv y-1 assessed by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation to be due to food and water intake. Similarly, the excess lifetime cancer risk due to naturally occurring radioactive material exposure via date fruit consumption is seen to be below the International Commission on Radiological Protection cancer risk factor of 2.5 × 10-3 based on the additional annual dose limit of 1 mSv for a member of the general public. The results show no significant uptake in the analyzed date fruits. ?

Scientists, medical experts, politicians, journalists, and mobile telecommunication company specialists are involved in an active debate on whether people are immune to RF or if we are gambling with our future. Interviews with 31 individuals from 7 stakeholder groups in Malaysia reveal that the residents' main concerns are that the telecommunication companies do not follow guidelines and as a result the telecommunication structures are constructed close to their homes, which they perceive as a threat to public health. Some residents also do not want these structures because of cultural reasons, while some are jealous over rental income received by the landlords. Meanwhile, the authorities entrusted with safe-guarding public health are involved in a blame game as there is no agency that is clearly in charge. The interviews also highlight that the current risk communication initiatives are more reactive rather than proactive, and that the authorities do not speak in one voice. Based on the outcome of the interviews, eleven recommendations are formulated to improve risk communication initiatives in Malaysia. The recommendations stress on repairing, building, and strengthening trust, because trust in agencies, along with credibility, determines risk communication initiatives' effectiveness. These strategies can also be effectively replicated across regions to deal with contestations over RF-EMF emissions and the impact on health. ?

Although some successes were achieved in combating communicable diseases and improved childhood mortality rates, health systems in Asia are generally characterized by lack of accurate epidemiological information on congenital disorders, lack of human and financial resources, and inadequate focus on public health strategies to ensure targeted interventions, low level knowledge on congenital disorders amongst the community and healthcare providers and the ethical dilemma of managing rare congenital disorders in an environment of low national health expenditures. These bottlenecks must be addressed systematically and interventions such as the use of innovative epidemiological tools to overcome lack of data, increased efforts to standardize rare disease nomenclature and classification and renewed interest in birth defects registries by countries in the region must be considered. Targeted curative and public health approaches currently used in thalassaemia and neural tube defects may be used for other congenital disorders in Asian countries.

Demographic, anthropometric and psychological data were also collected. Psychological variables included PA guideline knowledge, motivational profile for PA self-regulation (5 subscales), perceived barriers to PA (4 subscales) and perceived social support for PA. Regression models with adjustment for socio-demographic variables were fitted. Results: External regulation (b = ? 13.03, 95% CI ? 34.55; ? 1.50) and perceived daily life barriers (b = ? 12.63, 95% CI ? 24.95; ? 0.32) were significantly associated with fewer weekly MVPA minutes. A significant interaction between perceived social support and age (p = 0.046) was found. Social support was significantly negative associated with MVPA minutes in younger (< 28?years), but not in older participants. Conclusions: Considering levels of self-determination to engage in PA and perceived daily life barriers may be important for planning PA interventions in urban Asian populations. Caution is required when promoting social support for PA as it was associated with lower MVPA in younger people. ? 2019, Swiss School of Public Health (SSPH+).",Cognition; Exercise; Health behavior; Health promotion; Movement; Personal autonomy; Self-determination,"accelerometry; adolescent; adult; aged; anthropometry; Asian continental ancestry group; cross-sectional study; exercise; female; human; male; middle aged; motivation; physiology; psychology; questionnaire; social support; statistics and numerical data; urban population; very elderly; young adult; Accelerometry; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anthropometry; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Cross-Sectional Studies; Exercise; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Social Support; Surveys and Questionnaires; Urban Population; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85061305208

Methods: GBS patients were consecutively recruited and the results were compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. A series of autonomic function tests including computation-dependent tests (power spectrum analysis of HRV and BRS at rest) and challenge maneuvers (deep breathing, eyeball compression, active standing, the Valsalva maneuver, sustained handgrip, and the cold pressor test) were performed. Results: Ten GBS patients (six men; mean age = 40.1 ± 13.9?years) and ten gender- and age-matched healthy controls were recruited. The mean GBS functional grading scale at disease plateau was 3.4 ± 1.0. No patients required intensive care unit admission or mechanical ventilation.

A key property of such model is that the distribution of the observed count data is independent, conditional on the latent process, although the observations are correlated marginally. Our simulation shows that the Monte Carlo Expectation Maximization (MCEM) algorithm and the particle method are useful for the parameter estimation of the proposed model.

Being an important vector of dengue virus, Aedes aegypti are subjected to control measures which rely heavily on the usage of insecticides. Evidently, insecticide resistance in Ae. aegypti, which arise from several different point mutations within the voltage-gated sodium channel genes, has been documented in many countries. Thus, this robust study was conducted in all nine districts of Selangor to understand the mechanisms of resistance to various insecticides in Ae. aegypti. Mosquitoes were collected from dengue epidemic and non-dengue outbreak areas in Selangor. Methods: Using the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bottle assays, the insecticide resistance status of nine different Ae. aegypti strains from Selangor was accessed. Synergism tests and biochemical assays were conducted to further understand the metabolic mechanisms of insecticide resistance. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and sequencing of the IIP-IIS6 as well as IIIS4-IIIS6 regions of the sodium channel gene were performed to enable comparisons between susceptible and resistant mosquito strains. Additionally, genomic DNA was used for allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) genotyping of the gene to detect the presence of F1534C, V1016G and S989P mutations. Results: Adult female Ae. aegypti from various locations were susceptible to malathion and propoxur. However, they exhibited different levels of resistance against dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and pyrethroids. The results of synergism tests and biochemical assays indicated that the mixed functions of oxidases and glutathione S-transferases contributed to the DDT and pyrethroid resistance observed in the present study. Besides detecting three single kdr mutations, namely F1534C, V1016G and S989P, co-occurrence of homozygous V1016G/S989P (double allele) and F1534C/V1016G/S989P (triple allele) mutations were also found in Ae. aegypti. As per the results, the three kdr mutations had positive correlations with the expressions of resistance to DDT and pyrethroids. Conclusions: In view of the above outcomes, it is important to seek new tools for vector management instead of merely relying on insecticides. If the latter must be used, regular monitoring of insecticide resistance should also be carried out at all dengue epidemic areas. Since the eggs of Ae. aegypti can be easily transferred from one location to another, it is probable that insecticide-resistant Ae. aegypti can be found at non-dengue outbreak sites as well. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Aedes aegypti; Bioassays; Biochemical; Kdr mutation; Synergists,"chlorphenotane; glutathione transferase; malathion; oxidoreductase; propoxur; pyrethroid; sodium channel; glutathione transferase; insect protein; insecticide; oxidoreductase; sodium channel; adult; Aedes aegypti; allele specific polymerase chain reaction; animal experiment; Article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; drug metabolism; drug potentiation; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; female; gene; gene frequency; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic correlation; genetic screening; geographic distribution; homozygosity; insecticide resistance; kdr gene; Malaysia; molecular biology; mutational analysis; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; vector control; Aedes; allele; animal; dengue; DNA sequence; enzymology; genetics; genotype; insecticide resistance; mosquito vector; mutation; transmission; Aedes; Alleles; Animals; Dengue; Female; Genotype; Glutathione Transferase; Insect Proteins; Insecticide Resistance; Insecticides; Malathion; Malaysia; Mosquito Vectors; Mutation; Oxidoreductases; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pyrethrins; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sodium Channels",2-s2.0-85065858440

Larger size bones obviously require longer freeze drying time to reduce water content to the required level for long term storage at room temperature. For small size bone cubes or chips, it is a normal practice to pool cortical and cancellous bones for freeze drying. The study was aimed at determining if different type of bones of the same size influence the drying time. Human bone cubes of 10 mm x 10 mm x 10 mm were prepared from cortical bone of tibiae and cancellous bone from femoral heads. The bone cubes were freeze dried to reduce water content to less than 6%. Moisture content was monitored using gravimetric method.Weight and density of cortical bone were significantly higher than cancellous bone despite of having similar small size (p&lt;0.05). Cortical bones (density 2.05 ± 0.35 g/cm3) with initial water content of 10.93% required 5 hours to freeze dry, while cancellous bone cubes (density 0.72 ± 0.44 g/cm3) with initial water content of 78.95% required only 1.87 hours. This study confirmed that the structure hence density of human bone cubes determine the freeze drying time. Therefore in the standard operating procedure for freeze drying of bone allograft cubes, high density cortical bone cubes and low density cancellous bone cubes must be freeze dried separately despite being of similar small size. ? 2019, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.

The primary objective was to evaluate predictors of functional outcome in acute ischaemic stroke (AIS) patients treated with IV rt-PA. The secondary objective was to assess the outcome with the modified Rankin scale (mRS). We also examined the predictive value of the Totaled Health Risks in Vascular Events (THRIVE) score. METHODS AIS patients treated with IV rt-PA from February 2012 to August 2016 were recruited. Demographic data, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, timing and neuroradiological findings were recorded. Patients received a dose of 0.9 mg/kg IV rt-PA within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. mRS score was evaluated at discharge and three months, and good and poor clinical outcomes were defined as scores of 0–2 and 3–6, respectively. Baseline THRIVE scores were assessed. RESULTS 36 patients received IV rt-PA. 20 (55.6%) patients had an mRS score of 0–2 at three months. Based on THRIVE score, 86.1% had a good or moderately good prognosis. On univariate analysis, poor outcome was associated with NIHSS score before rt-PA (p = 0.03), THRIVE score (p = 0.02), stroke subtype (p = 0.049) and diabetes mellitus (DM; p = 0.06). Multiple logistic regression showed that outcome was significantly associated with NIHSS score before rt-PA (p = 0.032) and DM (p = 0.010). CONCLUSION Our newly developed Malaysian IV rt-PA service is safe, with similar outcomes to the published literature. Functional outcome after thrombolysis was associated with baseline NIHSS score and DM. ? 2019, Singapore Medical Association.

In the present study, a complex coacervation microencapsulation was used to encapsulate curcuminoids using gelatin B and chitosan. This study also focused on studying and confirming the potential of curcuminoids in a microencapsulated form as a wound healing agent. The potential of curcuminoids for wound management was evaluated using an in vitro human keratinocyte cell (HaCaT) model and the in vivo heater-inflicted burn wound model, providing evidence that the antioxidant activities of both forms of curcuminoids, encapsulated or not, are higher than those of butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene in trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC) and (2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate) (DPPH) studies. However, curcuminoids did not have much impact towards cell migration and proliferation in comparison with the negative control in the in vitro HaCaT study. The micoencapsulation formulation was shown to significantly influence wound healing in terms of increasing the wound contraction rate, hydroxyproline synthesis, and greater epithelialisation, which in turn provides strong justification for the incorporation of the microencapsulated formulation of curcuminoids as a topical treatment for burns and wound healing management as it has the potential to act as a crucial wound healing agent in healthcare settings. ? 2019 by the authors.

Conclusion: There is no single best option for reconstruction in skeletally immature. This study demonstrates a favourable functional and survival outcome of paediatric patients with expandable endoprosthesis. The excellent MSTS functional scores reflect that patients were satisfied and adjusted well to activities of daily living following surgery despite the complications. ?

This study aimed to identify associated risk factors in cardiovascular disease among ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) male patients and obtain a feasible model to describe the data. A total of 16,673 STEMI male patients from 18 participating hospitals across Malaysia in the National Cardiovascular Disease Database-Acute Coronary Syndrome (NCVD-ACS) registry year 2006-2013 were analysed. Univariate analysis was conducted. Significant variables from the univariate analysis were further analysed by a multivariate logistic analysis to identify the prognostic factors. The most prevalent risk factor for male patients was smoking (79.3%), followed by hypertension (54.9%) and diabetes mellitus (40.4%). At univariate level, this study is consistent with the findings from the Malaysian National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) where smoking is a significant risk factor. After adjustment in multivariate logistic model, the risk factors for cardiovascular death among male patients are related to age, premorbid condition such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, family history of CVD, Killip class, type of treatment such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and relevant comorbidity such as renal disease. Drastic efforts in the management of all risk factors in males is needed to improve adherence outcomes. ? 2019, Penerbit UTM Press.

Graphene stands as a preferred nano-therapeutic template, due to the advanced properties and cellular interaction mechanisms. Nevertheless, majority of graphene-based composites suffer from hindered development as efficient cancer therapeutics. Recent nano-toxicology reviews and recommendations emphasize on the preliminary synthetic stages as a crucial element in driving successful applications results. In this study, we present an integrated, green, one-pot hybridization of target-suited raw materials into curcumin-capped gold nanoparticle-conjugated reduced graphene oxide (CAG) nanocomposite, as a prominent anti-oxidant and anticancer agent. Distinct from previous studies, the beneficial attributes of curcumin are employed to their fullest extent, such that they perform dual roles of being a natural reducing agent and possessing antioxidant anti-cancer functional moiety. The proposed novel green synthesis approach secured an enhanced structure with dispersed homogenous AuNPs (15.62 ± 4.04 nm) anchored on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) sheets, as evidenced by transmission electron microscopy, surpassing other traditional chemical reductants. On the other hand, safe, non-toxic CAG elevates biological activity and supports biocompatibility. Free radical DPPH inhibition assay revealed CAG antioxidant potential with IC50(324.1 ± 1.8%) value reduced by half compared to that of traditional citrate-rGO-AuNP nanocomposite (612.1 ± 10.1%), which confirms the amplified multi-potent antioxidant activity. Human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29 and SW-948) showed concentration- and time-dependent cytotoxicity for CAG, as determined by optical microscopy images and WST-8 assay, with relatively low IC50values (~100 μg/ml), while preserving biocompatibility towards normal human colon (CCD-841) and liver cells (WRL-68), with high selectivity indices ( 2.0) at all tested time points. Collectively, our results demonstrate effective green synthesis of CAG nanocomposite, free of additional stabilizing agents, and its bioactivity as an antioxidant and selective anti-colon cancer agent. ? 2019 Al-Ani et al.

Conditioned media (CM) from stem cells shows promise in regenerative medicine. Our aim was to evaluate the potential CM of dental pulp stem cells obtained from human deciduous teeth (SHED-CM) to stimulate hair growth under in vitro and in vivo conditions. SHED and hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) (n = 3) were cultured in media combinations; i) STK2, ii) DMEM-KO+10% FBS, iii) STK2+2% FBS and profiled for the presence of positive hair growth-regulatory paracrine factors; SDF-1, HGF, VEGF-A, PDGF-BB and negative hair growth-regulatory paracrine factors; IL-1α, IL-1β, TGF-β, bFGF, TNF-α, and BDNF. The potential of CM from both cell sources to stimulate hair growth was evaluated based on the paracrine profile and measured dynamics of hair growth under in vitro conditions. The administration of CM media to telogen-staged synchronized 7-week old C3H/HeN female mice was carried out to study the potential of the CM to stimulate hair growth in vivo. SHED and HFSCs cultured in STK2 based media showed a shorter population doubling time, higher viability and better maintenance of MSC characteristics in comparison to cells cultured in DMEM-KO media. STK2 based CM contained only two negative hair growth-regulatory factors; TNF-α, IL-1 while DMEM-KO CM contained all negative hair growth-regulatory factors. The in vitro study confirmed that treatment with STK2 based media CM from passage 3 SHED and HFSCs resulted in a significantly higher number of anagen-staged hair follicles (p<0.05) and a significantly lower number of telogen-staged hair follicles (p<0.05). Administration of SHED-CM to C3H/HeN mice resulted in a significantly faster stimulation of hair growth in comparison to HFSC-CM (p<0.05), while the duration taken for complete hair coverage was similar for both CM sources. Thus, SHED-CM carries the potential to stimulate hair growth which can be used as a treatment tool for alopecia. ? 2019 Gunawardena et al.

Data was collected from dogs (n = 266) and dog handlers (n = 161) using a standardised guided questionnaire. Serum obtained from the dogs and dog handlers was tested using the microscopic agglutination test (MAT). A logistic regression analysis was used to predict leptospiral seropositivity of dogs and dog handlers based on potential risk factors. A total of 22.2% of dogs and 21.7% of dog handlers were seropositive. The significant predictors for the dogs’ seropositivity were presence of rats (OR = 4.61 (95% CI: 1.05, 20.33), p = 0.043) and shared common area (OR = 5.12 (95% CI: 1.94, 13.46), p = 0.001) within the organisation. Significant predictor for dog handler seropositivity was contact time with the dogs of more than six hours/day (OR = 3.28 (95% CI: 1.28, 8.40), p = 0.013) after controlling for the effect of other risk factors such as small mammal contact, rat infestation at home, flooding at housing area (within three months) and urban locality. The exposure to various disease sources identified poses risk to dogs and dog handlers. Risk could be reduced with adequate application of protection at work while handling dogs and thus limiting contact with these sources and reducing exposure to infection. ? 2019 by the authors.

Methods: Literature search was performed using 6 electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, Ovid MEDLINE, EconLit, National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database, and ISI Web of Knowledge). The final search was performed in October 2018. All potential economic studies were then checked for eligibility. The reporting and methodological qualities of each study were independently assessed by 2 authors of this review, using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards, Drummond, and Philips checklists. To compare the different currencies used in these studies, all costs were converted into US dollars (2016). Results: A total of 6 studies were included; most of them were performed from the healthcare provider perspective. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio for evaluation performed for a lifetime horizon were reported at $8573 and $20 816 per quality-adjusted life-year in 2 studies. The model outcome was generally sensitive to the changes in trastuzumab drug acquisition cost and discount rate, as well as its clinical effectiveness. For the quality assessment, all studies fulfilled more than 50% of the requirements in the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards, Drummond, and Philips checklists. Conclusions: Adjuvant trastuzumab therapy is considered a cost-effective option for early breast cancer in Asian countries including China, Iran, Japan, Singapore, and Taiwan. All studies were generally well conducted. Economic evaluations from the societal perspective, with inclusion of indirect and informal care costs, are warranted to facilitate informed decision making among policy makers. ? 2019 ISPOR—The professional society for health economics and outcomes research",adjuvant; Asia; early breast cancer; HER2-positive; trastuzumab,trastuzumab; trastuzumab; Article; Asian; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; early cancer; economic evaluation; health care cost; human; policy; priority journal; social norm; systematic review; breast tumor; cost benefit analysis; economics; female; procedures; secondary prevention; standards; Breast Neoplasms; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Female; Humans; Secondary Prevention; Trastuzumab,2-s2.0-85065421455

The clinical pattern of this life threatening complication has never been described in Malaysian setting. This study is to investigate the incidence, clinical characteristics and outcome of STEMI patients with CS in our population. Design A retrospective analysis of STEMI patients from 18 hospitals across Malaysia contributing to the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Database-acute coronary syndrome) registry (NCVD-ACS) year 2006-2013. Participants 16 517 patients diagnosed of STEMI from 18 hospitals in Malaysia from the year 2006 to 2013. Primary outcome measures In-hospital and 30 day post-discharge mortality. Results CS complicates 10.6% of all STEMIs in this study. They had unfavourable premorbid conditions and poor outcomes. The in-hospital mortality rate was 34.1% which translates into a 7.14 times mortality risk increment compared with STEMI without CS. Intravenous thrombolysis remained as the main urgent reperfusion modality. Percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in CS conferred a 40% risk reduction over non-invasive therapy but were only done in 33.6% of cases. Age over 65, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, chronic lung and kidney disease conferred higher risk of mortality. Conclusion Mortality rates of CS complicating STEMI in Malaysia are high. In-hospital PCI confers a 40% mortality risk reduction but the rate of PCI among our patients with CS complicating STEMI is still low. Efforts are being made to increase access to invasive therapy for these patients. ? 2019 Author(s) (or their employer(s)). Re-use permitted under CC BY-NC. No commercial re-use.

Early detection of resistance could assist authorities in deciding well-suited control strategies to minimize operational failures of Ae. aegypti control. Herein, biochemical analysis was performed to investigate the mechanisms involved in pyrethroid resistance in nine populations of Indonesian Ae. aegypti. Enzymes of adult Ae. aegypti such as esterases (ESTs), glutathione-S-transferases (GSTs), and mixed-function oxidases (MFOs) were characterized. Elevated MFO activity was correlated with resistance phenotype, indicating the role of this enzyme in contributing to pyrethroid resistance. No significant correlations were shown between pyrethroid resistance phenotype and α-ESTs, suggesting that marginally exceeded enzyme levels relative to the reference strain in some pyrethroid-susceptible populations were causative factor for insecticide resistance in other groups of insecticides. However, significant correlation was demonstrated between β-ESTs and pyrethroid resistance phenotype. The lowest enzyme levels in GSTs indicated that this enzyme was not predominant in causing pyrethroid resistance, despite the presence of significant correlations. Because metabolic detoxification fails to comprehensively explain the pyrethroid resistance in some Indonesian Ae. aegypti, additional mechanisms such as altered target sites in voltage-gated sodium channel may also contribute to the high pyrethroid resistance in Ae. aegypti. ?

Note that the publishers of Drug Des Devel Ther, with whom we were liaising, agreed with the decision to issue a Corrigendum for this paper that acknowledges the article published in Drug Des Devel Ther. The authors regret their failure to acknowledge the related paper in this instance, and apologize to the readership for this oversight.

We report a case of young stewardess who presented with fingertip chemical burn injury. Surgical debridement was done on third day post-injury. A cross-finger flap to cover skin defect and split-thickness nail bed grafting from the remnant of injured finger were done. Excellent functional and cosmetic outcome was achieved in 6 months. Surgical treatment in a chemical burn was similar to traumatic injury. Nail bed graft was the best option for nail bed reconstruction.

Method: A prospective observational study on idiopathic clubfoot patients less than 3 months old. Clinical assessment was done using hindfoot Pirani score and measurement of ankle dorsiflexion. Serial ultrasonography was done to measure the length and thickness of the Achilles tendon pre-hindfoot correction, 3 and 6 weeks post-hindfoot correction. Independent t-test was used to analyse the increase in ankle dorsiflexion, improvement in length and thickness of Achilles tendon between the two groups. Mann–Whitney U test was used to analyse the improvement in hindfoot Pirani score. Pearson correlation test was used for correlation in between clinical severity and ultrasonography assessment. Results: Twenty-three patients with bilateral clubfoot and four with unilateral clubfoot were recruited with a total of 50 clubfeet. Each group consists of 25 feet with a mean age of 2 months. Marked improvement in hindfoot correction was noted in tenotomy group compared to non-tenotomy group as evidenced by significant increase in Achilles tendon length, ankle dorsiflexion and improvement of hindfoot Pirani score. No significant difference in Achilles tendon thickness was noted between the two groups. Positive correlation was demonstrated between increase in Achilles tendon length and increase in ankle dorsiflexion as well as improvement in hindfoot Pirani score. Conclusion: We would like to propose Achilles tendon tenotomy in all clubfoot patients as it is concretely evident that superior hindfoot correction was achieved in tenotomy group. ?

We aimed to identify common germline variants associated with EOC risk in Asian women. Methods: Genotyping was performed as part of the OncoArray project. Samples with &gt;60% Asian ancestry were included in the analysis. Genotyping was performed on 533,631 SNPs in 3238 Asian subjects diagnosed with invasive or borderline EOC and 4083 unaffected controls. After imputation, genotypes were available for 11,595,112 SNPs to identify associations. Results: At chromosome 6p25.2, SNP rs7748275 was associated with risk of serous EOC (odds ratio [OR] = 1.34, P = 8.7 × 10 ?9 ) and high-grade serous EOC (HGSOC) (OR = 1.34, P = 4.3 × 10 ?9 ). SNP rs6902488 at 6p25.2 (r 2 = 0.97 with rs7748275) lies in an active enhancer and is predicted to impact binding of STAT3, P300 and ELF1. We identified additional risk loci with low Bayesian false discovery probability (BFDP) scores, indicating they are likely to be true risk associations (BFDP &lt;10%). At chromosome 20q11.22, rs74272064 was associated with HGSOC risk (OR = 1.27, P = 9.0 × 10 ?8 ). Overall EOC risk was associated with rs10260419 at chromosome 7p21.3 (OR = 1.33, P = 1.2 × 10 ?7 ) and rs74917072 at chromosome 2q37.3 (OR = 1.25, P = 4.7 × 10 ?7 ). At 2q37.3, expression quantitative trait locus analysis in 404 HGSOC tissues identified ESPNL as a putative candidate susceptibility gene (P = 1.2 × 10 ?7 ). Conclusion: While some risk loci were shared between East Asian and European populations, others were population-specific, indicating that the landscape of EOC risk in Asian women has both shared and unique features compared to women of European ancestry. ? 2019",Asian ancestry; Enhancer; Epithelial ovarian cancer; eQTL; Gene regulation; Genome-wide association study,"E1A associated p300 protein; STAT3 protein; transcription factor Elf 1; Article; cancer grading; cancer risk; carcinogenesis; chromosome 20q; chromosome 2q; chromosome 6p; chromosome 7p; controlled study; East Asian; enhancer region; expression quantitative trait locus; female; gene frequency; gene locus; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; genome-wide association study; genotype; human; major clinical study; ovary carcinoma; phenotype; priority journal; protein binding; single nucleotide polymorphism; Asian continental ancestry group; case control study; genetic predisposition; genetics; genome-wide association study; nucleotide sequence; quantitative trait locus; single nucleotide polymorphism; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Base Sequence; Carcinoma, Ovarian Epithelial; Case-Control Studies; Female; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci",2-s2.0-85063043908

Our study aimed to assess the following: i) baseline level of epilepsy AKA of Malaysian parents of CWE and explore potential characteristics associated with low levels of AKA; ii) effectiveness of the IAEEP in improving parental AKA, and whether these effects remained stable over time; and iii) effects of the IAEEP on parental mental state and perception of their child's quality of life. Methods: This prospective study includes parents of CWE aged 8–18 years old with no comorbidities. Epilepsy education was delivered using the IAEEP. Parents completed an AKA questionnaire before (time point 1 [TP1]), immediately after (TP2), and 4–6 months (TP3) after the provision of IAEEP. Parent proxy report of Health-Related Quality of Life Measurement for Children with Epilepsy (CHEQOL)-25 questionnaire and Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS)-21 questionnaire was completed at TP1 and TP3. Results: A total of 78 parents participated in the study. At baseline (TP1), parental responses were rated as “moderate” for awareness domain, “high” for knowledge domain, “very positive” for attitude domain, and “good” for total AKA score domain. No epilepsy or parental characteristics were associated with the low baseline parental AKA levels. After IAEEP intervention, there was a significant increase in all AKA subdomain scores. Post-IAEEP, the AKA of parents were rated as “very high” for awareness domain, “very high” for knowledge domain, “very positive” for attitude domain, and “excellent” for total AKA domain at both TP2 and TP3. Parent proxy CHEQOL-25 report showed significant increments in interpersonal/social and secrecy scale scores between TP1 and TP3. There were no significant differences in the DASS-21 scores between TP1 and TP3. Conclusion: The IAEEP is an effective epilepsy educational tool to increase the levels of AKA among parents of CWE. Following the use of the IAEEP, parents of CWE also reported an improvement of their child's quality of life in the interpersonal/social and epilepsy secrecy CHEQOL-25 domains. There was no impact on parental mental health following exposure to the IAEEP. ? 2019 Elsevier Inc.",Attitude; Awareness; Epilepsy; Epilepsy education program; Knowledge; Quality of life,adult; Article; awareness; benign childhood epilepsy; Depression Anxiety Stress Scale; education program; female; Health Related Quality of Life Measurement for Children with Epilepsy; human; human experiment; human relation; knowledge; Malaysian; male; normal human; parental attitude; prospective study; quality of life; quality of life assessment; questionnaire; simulation training; social behavior,2-s2.0-85063007246

Aim: To identify and critically appraise existing clinical prediction models of extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-EKP) infection or colonization. Methods: Electronic databases, reference lists, and citations were searched from inception to April 2018. Papers were included in any language describing the development or validation, or both, of models and scores to predict the risk of ESBL-EKP infection or colonization. Findings: In all, 1795 references were screened, of which four articles were included in the review. The included studies were carried out in different geographical locations with differing study designs, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most if not all studies lacked external validation and blinding of reviewers during the evaluation of the predictor variables and outcome. All studies excluded missing data and most studies did not report the number of patients excluded due to missing data. Fifteen predictors of infection or colonization with ESBL-EKP were identified. Commonly included predictors were previous antibiotic use, previous hospitalization, transfer from another healthcare facility, and previous procedures (urinary catheterization and invasive procedures). Conclusion: Due to limitations and variations in the study design, clinicians would have to take these differences into consideration when deciding on how to use these models in clinical practice. Due to lack of external validation, the generalizability of these models remains a question. Therefore, further external validation in local settings is needed to confirm the usefulness of these models in supporting decision-making. ? 2019 The Healthcare Infection Society",ESBL; Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases score; Prediction; Risk stratification,antibiotic therapy; bacterial colonization; bacterium culture; bladder catheterization; clinical assessment; Enterobacteriaceae infection; extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae; hospital infection; hospitalization; human; invasive procedure; nonhuman; patient transport; prediction; Review; risk assessment; risk factor; systematic review; aged; decision support system; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae infection; enzymology; female; heterozygote; isolation and purification; male; microbiology; middle aged; beta lactamase; Aged; beta-Lactamases; Carrier State; Decision Support Techniques; Enterobacteriaceae; Enterobacteriaceae Infections; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85061779489

We set out to review the clinical features of ten cases of PAO from a single UK centre. Patients had attended the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases, Bath (RNHRD) between January 2000 and June 2016. The principal criterion for inclusion was the occurrence of low trauma fractures either during pregnancy or the immediate post-partum period. Data were obtained from retrospective review of medical notes. Bone mineral density (BMD) was measured using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (Hologic ?Discovery system) at the lumbar spine and hip. Data pertaining to the pregnancy, as well as type and duration of treatment received, were reviewed. All ten cases presented with vertebral fractures. In four patients, no risk factors for fracture other than pregnancy or breastfeeding could be identified. Four patients were found to have vitamin D insufficiency at the time of diagnosis, and a further two patients had received treatment with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). In one case, further investigation led to a diagnosis of osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) confirmed on genetic testing. In terms of treatment, eight out of the ten patients in this series received a bisphosphonate, most commonly risedronate due to its relatively short skeletal retention time. Clinicians should be aware of PAO, a rare but recognised complication of pregnancy. The condition should be especially considered in women presenting with new onset back pain in pregnancy or the postpartum period. ? 2019, International Osteoporosis Foundation and National Osteoporosis Foundation.",Fractures; Osteoporosis; Pregnancy,"bisphosphonic acid derivative; dalteparin; low molecular weight heparin; risedronic acid; vitamin D; bone density conservation agent; backache; bone density; clinical feature; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; disease association; dual energy X ray absorptiometry; exon; follow up; genetic disorder; genetic screening; hip; human; image analysis; lumbar spine; lung embolism; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; onset age; osteoclast activity; osteogenesis imperfecta; osteoporosis; outcome assessment; pregnancy; priority journal; puerperium; retention time; Review; rheumatic disease; risk factor; spine fracture; treatment duration; treatment response; vitamin D deficiency; adult; backache; case report; complication; female; fragility fracture; middle aged; osteoporosis; pathophysiology; photon absorptiometry; physiology; pregnancy; pregnancy complication; puerperal disorder; retrospective study; spine fracture; young adult; Absorptiometry, Photon; Adult; Back Pain; Bone Density; Bone Density Conservation Agents; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Osteoporotic Fractures; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Puerperal Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Spinal Fractures; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85060535355

The primary aim of this study was to determine all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-related mortality between conservative management and radical treatment for localised prostate cancer. Methods: All randomised clinical trials were searched in MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed and CENTRAL from their inception until September 2018. Results: Four trials were eligible (n = 3211) for inclusion in the data synthesis. In patients who had radical treatment, the incidence of all-cause mortality and prostate cancer-related mortality (three trials, 3069 patients) were reduced (with odds ratio, i.e. 95% confidence interval (CI)), of 1.37 (1.14–1.64), ρ < 0.001, low quality of evidence and odd ratio (95% CI) of 1.74 (1.31–2.30), ρ < 0.001, low quality of evidence, respectively). The radical treatment group was associated with reduced incidence of distant metastases, the odds ratio (95% CI) being 1.87 (1.48–2.36), ρ < 0.001, low quality of evidence. However, patients who were randomised to radical treatment had a significantly higher incidence of erectile dysfunction (the odds ratio (95% CI) being 0.62 (0.39–0.98), ρ = 0.04, very low quality of evidence) and urinary incontinence (odds ratio (95% CI) of 0.42 (0.21–0.86), ρ = 0.02, very low quality of evidence). Conclusions: In summary, radical treatments reduce all-cause mortality, and prostate cancer-related and distant metastases, at the expense of higher incidence of erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence.

Materials and methods: This study involves administration of 4NQO solution for 8?weeks alone (cancer induction) or with Dracaena cinnabari (DC) extract at 100, 500, and 1000?mg/kg. DC extract administration started 1?week before exposure until 1?week after the carcinogen exposure was stopped. All rats were sacrificed after 22?weeks, and histological analysis was performed to assess any incidence of pathological changes. Immunohistochemical expressions of selected tumor marker antibodies were analyzed using an image analyzer computer system, and the expression of selected genes involved in apoptosis and proliferative mechanism related to oral cancer were evaluated using RT 2 -PCR. Results: The incidence of OSCC decreased with the administration of DC extract at 100, 500, and 1000?mg/kg compared to the induced cancer group. The developed tumor was also observed to be smaller when compared to the induced cancer group. The DC 1000?mg/kg group inhibits the expression of Cyclin D1, Ki-67, Bcl-2, and p53 proteins. It was observed that DC 1000?mg/kg induced apoptosis by upregulation of Bax and Casp3 genes and downregulation of Tp53, Bcl-2, Cox-2, Cyclin D1, and EGFR genes when compared to the induced cancer group.

This study assessed the impact of funded prioritised research and identified research gaps to inform future priority setting initiatives for universal access and quality healthcare in Malaysia. Methods: Research impact of universal access and quality healthcare projects funded by the National Institutes of Health Malaysia were assessed based on the modified Payback Framework, addressing categories of informing policy, knowledge production, and benefits to health and health sector. For the HRPS process, the Child Health and Nutrition Research Initiative methodology was adapted and adopted, with the incorporation of stakeholder values using weights and monetary allocation survey. Workshop discussions and interviews with stakeholders and research groups were conducted to identify research gaps, with the use of conceptual frameworks to guide the search. Results: Seventeen ongoing and 50 completed projects were identified for research funding impact analysis. Overall, research fund allocation differed from stakeholders' expectation. For research impact, 48 out of 50 completed projects (96.0%) contributed to some form of policy-making efforts. Almost all completed projects resulted in outputs that contributed to knowledge production and were expected to lead to health and health sector benefits. The HRPS process led to the identification of research priority areas that stemmed from ongoing and new issues identified for universal access and quality healthcare. Conclusion: The concerted efforts of evaluation of research funding impact, prioritisation, dissemination and policy-maker involvement were valuable for optimal health research resource utilisation in a resource constrained developing country. Embedding impact evaluation into a priority setting process and funding research based on national needs could facilitate health research investment to reach its potential. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Health research priority setting; Payback framework; Quality healthcare; Research funding; Research impact; Research priority areas; Stakeholder engagement; Stakeholder values; Universal access,article; child health; conceptual framework; developing country; embedding; evaluation research; expectation; funding; human; interview; investment; Malaysia; management; medical research; national health organization; nutrition; research priority; stakeholder engagement; administrative personnel; decision making; economics; financial management; health care planning; health care quality; health services research; Malaysia; methodology; resource allocation; Administrative Personnel; Decision Making; Developing Countries; Health Priorities; Health Services Research; Humans; Malaysia; Policy Making; Quality of Health Care; Research Design; Research Support as Topic; Resource Allocation,2-s2.0-85065295651

This could be due to presence of medial dan lateral shoulder discordance.Methods.One hundred fifty-one Lenke 1 and 2 AIS patients were recruited. Lenke 1 curves were subclassified into Lenke 1-ve (flexible) (proximal thoracic side bending [PTSB] Cobb angle <15°) and 1+ve curves (stiff) (PTSB Cobb angle between 15° and 24.9°). T1 tilt represented ""medial shoulder balance"" and radiological shoulder height (RSH) represented ""lateral shoulder balance."" We categorized patients into three concordant shoulder pattern types (medial balanced/lateral balanced [MBLB], medial imbalanced+ve/lateral imbalanced+ve (MI+ve/LI+ve), medial imbalanced-ve/lateral Imbalanced-ve (MI-ve/LI-ve), and six discordant shoulder pattern types.Results.The mean age was 16.2±5.7 years. Eighty-one patients (53.6%) had concordant pattern and 70 patients (46.4%) had discordant pattern. Lateral shoulder imbalance was noted in 35.1% of patients and medial shoulder imbalance in 43.7% of patients. In Lenke 1-ve curves, 35 patients (68.6%) had concordant shoulder imbalance with medial imbalanced-ve/lateral imbalanced-ve (MI-ve/LI-ve) being the commonest pattern (68.6%). In Lenke 1+ve curves, 33 patients (55.0%) had concordant shoulder pattern with medial balanced/lateral balanced (MB/LB) being the commonest type (57.6%). In Lenke 2 AIS, 27 patients (67.5%) had discordant pattern with medial imbalanced+ve/lateral balanced (MI+ve/LB) being the commonest pattern (44.4%) (P value=0.002).Conclusion.46.4% Lenke 1 and 2 AIS patients had shoulder discordant pattern. This was more prevalent in Lenke 2 curves (67.5%). In Lenke 1-ve (flexible) curves, MI-ve/LI-ve pattern was the commonest pattern. In Lenke 1+ve curves (stiff), there were almost equal number of concordant and discordant shoulder pattern. In Lenke 2 patients, the most common pattern was MI+ve/LB.Level of Evidence: 4. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Stigma against PWH in medical settings is understudied in Malaysia. In the present study, we examine factors associated with physicians’ intention to discriminate against PWH in Malaysia. A cross-sectional online survey was emailed to all 1431 physicians at two major university hospitals in Malaysia; 568 (39.6%) participants completed the survey and were included in this analysis. Measures included intention to discriminate against PWH, stigma-related constructs, and socio-demographic characteristics. Multivariate linear regression was used to identify factors associated with intention to discriminate against PWH. Participants were comprised of women (53.5%), Malays (43.1%), and Chinese (35.0%) with nearly 10?years of clinical experience. Most participants were from non-surgical specialties (77.6%). The final multivariate linear regression showed that physicians who expressed greater discriminatory intent against PWH also expressed more negative feelings toward PWH, more HIV-related shame, were more fearful of HIV, and believed that PWH do not deserve good care. Physicians from surgical-based specialties were also significantly more likely to endorse discriminatory intent toward PWH. Stigma and intentions to discriminate against a class of patients, including PWH, can undermine engagement in care, which is central to international HIV prevention and treatment strategies. Interventions that reduce stigma toward PWH among physicians are crucial to ensuring equitable and stigma-free healthcare. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Discrimination; Healthcare; HIV; Malaysia; Physicians; Stigma,adult; article; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; linear regression analysis; Malay (people); Malaysia; multicenter study; physician; shame; stigma; surgery; university hospital; behavior; cross-sectional study; ethnology; fear; health personnel attitude; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; Malaysia; male; middle aged; perceptive discrimination; physician; prejudice; psychology; questionnaire; social stigma; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Cross-Sectional Studies; Discrimination (Psychology); Fear; Female; HIV Infections; Humans; Intention; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Physicians; Prejudice; Social Stigma; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85058789071

This study aimed to develop and validate an instrument to measure Student Acceptance of Interprofessional Learning (SAIL) in Malaysia, and to assess this attribute among medical and pharmacy students using a prescribing skills training workshop. Methods: The study consisted of two phases. In Phase 1, a 10-item instrument (SAIL-10) was developed and tested on a cohort of medical and pharmacy students who attended the workshop. In Phase 2, different cohorts of medical and pharmacy students completed SAIL-10 before and after participating in the workshop. Results: Factor analysis showed that SAIL-10 has two domains: “facilitators of interprofessional learning” and “acceptance to learning in groups”. The overall SAIL-10 and the two domains have adequate internal consistency and stable reliability. The total score and scores for the two domains were significantly higher after students attended the prescribing skills workshop. Conclusions: This study produced a valid and reliable instrument, SAIL-10 which was used to demonstrate that the prescribing skills workshop, where medical and pharmacy students were placed in an authentic context, was a promising activity to promote interprofessional learning among future healthcare professionals. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Interprofessional learning; Medical student; Pharmacy students; Prescribing skills training; SAIL-10; Validation,"article; factor analysis; human; internal consistency; intervention study; learning; Malaysia; medical student; pharmacy student; prescription; skill; validation process; adverse drug reaction; education; health personnel attitude; medication error; pilot study; prescription; prevention and control; professional competence; public relations; reproducibility; standards; statistics and numerical data; validation study; Attitude of Health Personnel; Drug Prescriptions; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Education; Education, Pharmacy; Educational Measurement; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Medication Errors; Pilot Projects; Professional Competence; Reproducibility of Results; Students, Medical; Students, Pharmacy",2-s2.0-85063970997

A CHN elemental analysis, powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) data and several spectroscopic techniques such as Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray, 1 H, 13 C, and 31 P{ 1 H} NMR were performed to elucidate the structure of these complexes. Elemental analysis suggested that the stoichiometry of the complexes formed by the reaction of silver nitrate with thiosemicarbazone in the presence of (p-tolyl)PPh 2 was indeed 1:2:1 molar ratio. The silver ions were discovered to be coordinated to the sulfur of thiosemicarbazone and phosphorus of (p-tolyl)PPh 2 , having a tetrahedral geometry based on the spectroscopic data obtained. The PXRD patterns were studied to see the degree of crystallinity of the complexes. The in vitro antiproliferative activity of these complexes was investigated toward the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, as well as the HT-29 colon cancer cell line, which yielded IC 50 values in low micromolar range.

Therefore, this paper will review the roles of a low fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polypols (FODMAP) diet in treating IBS, particularly in an Asian setting. About 20% of the general population is diagnosed with IBS. However, there are limited effective medical therapies available for treating IBS. Therefore, IBS presents a major challenge to the health-care providers. Recently, there is an increasing interest in the use of a diet low in FODMAP for the treatment of IBS. A low FODMAP diet can decrease the delivery of readily fermentable substrates to the small intestine and colon, thereby improving functional gastrointestinal symptoms. ? 2018 The Authors.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between NAFLD and advanced fibrosis, as diagnosed by Fibroscan, with an increased CIMT in the Malaysian population. Methods: A cross-sectional study of government officers and their family members attending a health screening at a public healthcare facility was conducted. All subjects underwent clinical evaluation, biochemical testing, anthropometry, ultrasound carotid Doppler, and Fibroscan examination. Results: Data for 251 subjects were analyzed (mean age 47.1 ± 12.4 years, 74.1% male). Prevalence of NAFLD and advanced fibrosis were 57.4 and 17.5%, respectively. Independent factors associated with NAFLD were waist circumference (odds ratio [OR] = 1.077, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.038–1.118, P < 0.001) and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (OR = 1.039, 95% CI 1.005–1.074, P = 0.024).

Prevalence of increased CIMT was 29.0%. Independent factor associated with increased CIMT was older age (OR = 1.146, 95% CI 1.067–1.231, P < 0.001). Of the subjects, 34.5% with NAFLD had increased CIMT compared to 19.1% of the subjects without NAFLD (P = 0.063). Advanced fibrosis was not associated with increased CIMT. Conclusions: Prevalence of NAFLD, advanced liver fibrosis, and increased CIMT were high. NAFLD and advanced liver fibrosis appeared not to be associated with increased CIMT.

With the increasing burden of asthma in Malaysia, strategies aimed at reducing cost of care should be explored. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine if a clinical pathway (CPW) for inpatient paediatric asthma would reduce average length of stay (ALOS), improve asthma management and decrease cost. METHODS: A quasi-experimental, pre-post study was used to evaluate the CPW effectiveness. Paediatric inpatients aged 5-18 years old, admitted for acute asthma exacerbation from September 2015 to April 2016 were prospectively recruited. Data from patients admitted from January-July 2015 were used as control. CPW training was carried out in August 2015 using standardised modules. Direct admission cost from the provider’s prospective was calculated. Outcomes compared were differences in ALOS, discharge medication, readmission within 28 days of discharge and cost. RESULTS: ALOS is 26 hours lower in the CPW group for severe exacerbations and underlying uncontrolled asthma (19.2 hours) which is clinically significant as patients have shorter hospital stay. More newly-diagnosed intermittent asthmatics were discharged with relievers in the CPW group (p-value 0.006). None of the patients in the CPW group had readmissions (p-value 0.16). Mean treatment cost for patients in the intervention group is higher at RM843.39 (SD ±48.99, versus RM779.21 SD±44.33). CONCLUSION: This study found that management using a CPW may benefit asthmatic patients with uncontrolled asthma admitted with severe exacerbation. Further studies will be needed to explore CPW’s impact on asthma management starting from the emergency department. ? 2019, Malaysian Medical Association.

The cell morphological changes and viral morphogenesis of two dengue ecotypes were examined at the ultrastructural level to identify potential similarities and differences in the surrogate model of enzootic host. Materials and Methods: Vero cells were inoculated with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. Cell cultures were harvested over a time course and processed for transmission electron microscopic imaging. Results: The filopodia protrusions on cell periphery preceded virus entry. Additionally, sylvatic DENV infection was found spreading slower than the endemic DENV. Morphogenesis of both dengue ecotypes was alike but at different level of efficiency in the permissive cells. Conclusions: This is the first ultrastructural study on sylvatic DENV and this comparative study revealed the similarities and differences of cellular responses and morphogenesis of two dengue ecotypes in vitro. The study revealed the weaker infectivity of sylvatic DENV in the surrogate model of enzootic host, which supposed to support better replication of enzootic DENV than endemic DENV. ? 2019, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

It is biologically plausible that these long-term effects may be minimised in young children at increased risk of such sequelae if any residual lower airway infection and inflammation in their developing lungs can be treated successfully by longer antibiotic courses. In contrast, shortened antibiotic treatments are being promoted because of concerns over inducing antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, the optimal treatment duration remains unknown. Outcomes from randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on paediatric pneumonia have focused on short-term (usually <2 weeks) results. Indeed, no long-term RCT-generated outcome data are available currently. We hypothesise that a longer antibiotic course, compared with the standard treatment course, reduces the risk of chronic respiratory symptoms/signs or bronchiectasis 24 months after the original pneumonia episode. Methods and analysis This multicentre, parallel, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomised trial involving seven hospitals in six cities from three different countries commenced in May 2016. Three-hundred-and-fourteen eligible Australian Indigenous, New Zealand M? ori/Pacific and Malaysian children (aged 0.25 to 5 years) hospitalised for community-acquired, chest X-ray (CXR)-proven pneumonia are being recruited. Following intravenous antibiotics and 3 days of amoxicillin-clavulanate, they are randomised (stratified by site and age group, allocation-concealed) to receive either: (i) amoxicillin-clavulanate (80 mg/kg/day (maximum 980 mg of amoxicillin) in two-divided doses or (ii) placebo (equal volume and dosing frequency) for 8 days. Clinical data, nasopharyngeal swab, bloods and CXR are collected. The primary outcome is the proportion of children without chronic respiratory symptom/signs of bronchiectasis at 24 months. The main secondary outcomes are ? clinical cure' at 4 weeks, time-to-next respiratory-related hospitalisation and antibiotic resistance of nasopharyngeal respiratory bacteria.

With the decrease in incidence of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex infection and the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), the benefits of macrolide prophylaxis were investigated. This study examined the impact of macrolide prophylaxis on AIDS-defining conditions and HIV-associated mortality in a cohort of HIV-infected patients on ART.Methods:Patients from TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (September 2015 data transfer) aged 18 years and older with a CD4 count &lt;50 cells/mm3 at ART initiation were included. The effect of macrolide prophylaxis on HIV-associated mortality or AIDS-defining conditions (as a combined outcome) and HIV-associated mortality alone were evaluated using competing risk regression. Sensitivity analysis was conducted in patients with a CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 at ART initiation.Results:Of 1345 eligible patients, 10.6% received macrolide prophylaxis. The rate of the combined outcome was 7.35 [95% confidence interval (CI): 6.04 to 8.95] per 100 patient-years, whereas the rate of HIV-associated mortality was 3.14 (95% CI: 2.35 to 4.19) per 100 patient-years. Macrolide use was associated with a significantly decreased risk of HIV-associated mortality (hazard ratio 0.10, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.80, P = 0.031) but not with the combined outcome (hazard ratio 0.86, 95% CI: 0.32 to 2.229, P = 0.764). Sensitivity analyses showed consistent results among patients with a CD4 &lt;100 cells/mm3 at ART initiation.Conclusions:Macrolide prophylaxis is associated with improved survival among Asian HIV-infected patients with low CD4 cell counts and on ART. This study suggests the increased usage and coverage of macrolide prophylaxis among people living with HIV in Asia. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

We also determined the minimum number of blood pressure (BP) measurements needed to estimate long-term visit-to-visit BPV for predicting 10-year cardiovascular (CV) risk. Design Retrospective study Setting A primary care clinic in a university hospital in Malaysia. Participants Random sampling of 1403 patients aged 30 years and above without any CV event at baseline. Outcomes measures The effect of the number of BP measurement for calculation of long-term visit-to-visit BPV in predicting 10-year CV risk. CV events were defined as fatal and non-fatal coronary heart disease, fatal and non-fatal stroke, heart failure and peripheral vascular disease. Results The mean 10-year SD of systolic blood pressure (SBP) for this cohort was 13.8±3.5 mm Hg. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for the SD of SBP based on the first eight and second eight measurements was 0.38 (p<0.001). In a primary care setting, visit-to-visit BPV (SD of SBP calculated from 20 BP measurements) was significantly associated with CV events (adjusted OR 1.07, 95% CI 1.02 to 1.13, p=0.009). Using SD of SBP from 20 measurement as reference, SD of SBP from 6 measurements (median time 1.75 years) has high reliability (ICC 0.74, p<0.001), with a mean difference of 0.6 mm Hg. Hence, a minimum of six BP measurements is needed for reliably estimating intraindividual BPV for CV outcome prediction. Conclusion Long-term visit-to-visit BPV is reproducible in clinical practice. We suggest a minimum of six BP measurements for calculation of intraindividual visit-to-visit BPV. The number and duration of BP readings to derive BPV should be taken into consideration in predicting long-term CV risk. ? 2019 Author(s).

Binary logistic regression analysis was performed on the sociodemographic data and physical performance measures to determine the determinants and correlates of falls among these participants. The Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA) was the only significant (P <.05) physical performance measure that correlated with falls. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) Test and education levels were significant correlates and determinants of falls in this population, with the absence of PPA in the model. The PPA is the best physical performance measure correlate of falls among Malaysian community-dwelling older adults.

The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of EIBF and associated factors among Bangladeshi mothers. Methods The data was extracted from the Bangladesh Demographic and Health Survey (BDHS)-2014. A total of 4,092 married non-pregnant Bangladeshi mothers who had at least one child aged 2 years or younger were included in this study. A two-level logistic regression model was used to remove the clustering effect for finding the impact of socio-economic and demographic factors on EIBF. Results The prevalence of EIBF among Bangladeshi mothers was 51.4% (urban: 47.1% and rural: 53.4%). A two -level logistic regression model showed that mothers living in the Sylhet division (p<0.01) and rural environment (p<0.05) were more likely to practice EIBF. Mothers who were obese or overweight (p<0.01), had secondary (p<0.05) or higher education (p<0.01) were less likely to provide early breastfeeding to their newborn babies compared to their counterparts. Those who delivered by caesarian-section (p<0.01) were less likely to perform EIBF while those who attended an antenatal care clinic more than 3 times (p<0.05) were more likely to do so. Conclusions About half of the Bangladeshi mothers did not start breast-feeding within one hour after birth. This study identified several geographical and socio-demographic factors that were associated with EIBF, and hope that this information will help the government to focus their resources to promote early breastfeeding. ? 2019 Islam et al.

Over a quarter of participants (27.9%) reported injecting drugs in the past month; 49.8% of the sample tested positive for HCV. Respondents who had previously been arrested displayed increased odds of being HCV-positive (adjusted odds ratio = 4.79, confidence Interval = 2.46-9.35).

The availability of standard plasma VL testing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and access to this testing, are limited by the need to use fresh plasma. Good specimen collection methods for HIV VL testing that are applicable to resource-constrained settings are needed. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the filtered dried plasma spot (FDPS), created using the newly developed, instrument-free VLPlasma device, in identifying treatment failure at a VL threshold of 1,000 copies/ml in fresh plasma. Performance was compared with that of the conventional dried blood spot (DBS). Venous blood samples from 201 people living with HIV and attending an infectious disease clinic in Malaysia were collected, and HIV VL was quantified using fresh plasma (the reference standard), FDPS, and DBS specimens. VL testing was done using the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan v2.0 assay. At a threshold of 1,000 copies/ml, the diagnostic performance of the FDPS was superior (sensitivity, 100% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 89.1 to 100%]; specificity, 100% [95% CI, 97.8 to 100%]) to that of the DBS (sensitivity, 100% [95% CI, 89.4 to 100%]; specificity, 36.8% [95% CI, 29.4 to 44.7%]) (P?<?0.001). A stronger correlation was observed between the FDPS VL and the plasma VL (r?=?0.94; P?<?0.001) than between the DBS VL and the plasma VL (r?=?0.85; P?<?0.001). The mean difference in VL measures between the FDPS and plasma (plasma VL minus FDPS VL) was 0.127 log10 copies/ml (standard deviation [SD], 0.32), in contrast to -0.95 log10 copies/ml (SD, 0.84) between the DBS and plasma. HIV VL measurement using the FDPS outperformed that with the DBS in identifying treatment failure at a threshold of 1,000 copies/ml and compared well with the quantification of VL in plasma. The FDPS can be an attractive alternative to fresh plasma for improving access to HIV VL monitoring among people living with HIV on ART in LMICs.

The present study aimed to determine the epidemiology of polyparasitism (multiple parasitic infections) among rural communities in Kano State, North Central Nigeria. Methods A total of 551 individuals were screened for the presence of intestinal, urogenital and blood parasites by using different diagnostic techniques. Demographic, socioeconomic, household and behavioural characteristics were collected using a pre-tested questionnaire. Results Overall, 84.0% (463/551) of the participants were found to be infected with at least one parasite species, with 51.2% (282/551) of them having polyparasitism. The most prevalent parasites were Plasmodium falciparum (60.6%) followed by Blastocystis sp. (29.2%) and hookworm (15.4%). No significant association was found between malaria and helminth infections (p>0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that the presence of other family members who had intestinal polyparasitism (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=4.12; 95% CI=2.72, 6.24), walking barefoot outside (AOR=1.70; 95% CI=1.09, 2.63) and being male (AOR=1.74; 95% CI=1.14, 2.66) were the significant risk factors of intestinal polyparasitism among the population studied. Conclusion Polyparasitism is highly prevalent among rural communities in Kano State. Therefore, effective, sustainable and integrated control measures should be identified and implemented to significantly reduce the burden and consequences of these infections in rural Nigeria. ? 2018 The Author(s).",neglected tropical diseases; Nigeria; polyparasitism; risk factors,adult; Article; Blastocystis; cross-sectional study; demography; disease burden; female; helminthiasis; hookworm; household; human; major clinical study; male; mass screening; Nigeria; parasitism; parasitosis; Plasmodium falciparum; questionnaire; risk factor; rural population; socioeconomics,2-s2.0-85063712606

The prevalence of obesity is also significantly higher among the female adults. It is also known that low fitness level is a powerful and independent risk factor for premature mortality. However, the understanding of the relationship between overall body composition indices and cardiorespiratory fitness in adults remains limited. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between body composition with cardiorespiratory fitness among normal weight, overweight and obese in female adults. METHODS: Eighty-one female participants aged between 18 to 59 years who cleared the inclusion and exclusion criteria were divided into three groups; normal weight (N.=23), overweight (N.=29) and obese (N.=29). They went through bio-electrical impedance analysis measurement and cardiopulmonary fitness testing using ramp protocol in Sport Medicine human performance lab. RESULTS: It was noted that there was an inverse strong strength significant correlation between VO 2 max and Body Mass Index (r=-0.588, P&lt;0.001, Waist Hip Ratio (r=-0.596, P&lt;0.001), Percentage Body Fat (r=-0.684, P&lt;0.001) and Body Fat Mass (r=-0.667, P&lt;0.001). However, skeletal muscle mass showed no significant correlation with VO 2 max. There was also a high significant difference among the three groups in term of VO 2 max (F=7.683, P=0.001) after alleviating the age factor. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, our study showed significant correlation between VO 2 and body composition particularly percentage of body fat (%) and body fat mass (kg). It will be more convenience and cost-effective especially in developing countries, if body composition can be used as an independent entity to predict cardiorespiratory fitness among individual. Furthermore, cardiorespiratory exercise testing showed significant differences of VO 2 max among 3 groups. This will be beneficial if the VO 2 max is used as a tool to predict cardiovascular risk. Therefore, we would suggest in-depth studies to be done in the future to provide more knowledge regarding this important topic on a bigger scale subjects. ? 2018 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.",Body composition; Body Mass Index; Cardiorespiratory fitness; Exercise test; Obesity,adult; anthropometry; Article; body composition; body fat; body mass; cardiorespiratory fitness; cross-sectional study; ergometry; exercise test; female; human; impedance; middle aged; muscle mass; normal human; obesity; oxygen consumption; skeletal muscle; waist hip ratio; young adult,2-s2.0-85063348452

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to provide a global picture of the estimated influence of type 2 diabetes on the risk of all-cause and CHD mortality in women vs men. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science for studies published from their starting dates to Aug 7, 2018. The sex-specific hazard ratios (HRs) and their pooled ratio (women vs men) of all-cause and CHD mortality associated with type 2 diabetes were obtained through an inverse variance-weighted random-effects meta-analysis.

However, monotherapy with the ErbB blocker afatinib has shown limited survival benefits. Objectives: This study was performed to identify mechanisms of afatinib resistance and to explore potential afatinib-based combination treatments with other targeted inhibitors in oral squamous cell carcinoma. Methods: We determined the anti-proliferative effects of afatinib on a panel of oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines using a crystal violet-growth inhibition assay, click-iT 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine staining, and cell-cycle analysis. Biochemical assays were performed to study the underlying mechanism of drug treatment as a single agent or in combination with the MEK inhibitor trametinib. We further evaluated and compared the anti-tumor effects of single agent and combined treatment by using oral squamous cell carcinoma xenograft models. Results: In this study, we showed that afatinib inhibited oral squamous cell carcinoma cell proliferation via cell-cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase, and inhibited tumor growth in xenograft mouse models. Interestingly, we demonstrated reactivation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway in vitro, which possibly reduced the effects of ErbB inhibition. Concomitant treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma cells with afatinib and trametinib synergized the anti-tumor effects in oral squamous cell carcinoma-bearing mouse models. Conclusions: Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanism of resistance to afatinib and support further clinical evaluation into the combination of afatinib and MEK inhibition in the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,"afatinib; mitogen activated protein kinase 1; mitogen activated protein kinase 3; protein kinase B; trametinib; afatinib; antineoplastic agent; pyridone derivative; pyrimidinone derivative; trametinib; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer inhibition; cancer model; cell cycle progression; cell proliferation; controlled study; down regulation; drug effect; female; G1 phase cell cycle checkpoint; human; human cell; mouse; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; signal transduction; animal; apoptosis; cell cycle; drug potentiation; drug screening; metabolism; mouth tumor; nonobese diabetic mouse; pathology; SCID mouse; squamous cell carcinoma; tumor cell culture; Afatinib; Animals; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Apoptosis; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Cell Cycle; Cell Proliferation; Drug Synergism; Female; Humans; Mice; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Mouth Neoplasms; Pyridones; Pyrimidinones; Signal Transduction; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85062645420

These susceptibility studies are important to inform lead optimisation and support further drug development. Until recently, little was known about the susceptibility of non-falciparum species as these had not been adapted to in vitro culture. The recent culture adaptation of P. knowlesi has therefore offered an opportunity to routinely define the drug susceptibility of this species, which is phylogenetically closer to all other human malarias than is P. falciparum. We compared the in vitro susceptibility of P. knowlesi and P. falciparum to a range of established and novel antimalarial agents under identical assay conditions. We demonstrated that P. knowlesi is significantly less susceptible than P. falciparum to six of the compounds tested; and notably these include three ATP4 inhibitors currently under development as novel antimalarial agents, and one investigational antimalarial, AN13762, which is 67 fold less effective against P. knowlesi. For the other compounds there was a less than two-fold difference in susceptibility between species. We then compared the susceptibility of a recent P. knowlesi isolate, UM01, to that of the well-established, older A1-H.1 clone. This recent isolate showed similar in vitro drug susceptibility to the A1-H.1 clone, supporting the ongoing use of the better characterised clone to further study drug susceptibility. Lastly, we used isobologram analysis to explore the interaction of a selection of drug combinations and showed similar drug interactions across species. The species differences in drug susceptibility reported by us here and previously, support adding in vitro drug screens against P. knowlesi to those using P. falciparum strains to inform new drug discovery and lead optimisation. ? 2019 The Authors",Drug susceptibility; Isobolograms; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium knowlesi,antimalarial agent; antimalarial agent; artemisinin derivative; antimalarial drug susceptibility; Article; clone; controlled study; drug combination; in vitro study; nonhuman; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium knowlesi; priority journal; comparative study; drug development; drug effect; drug sensitivity; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium knowlesi; Antimalarials; Artemisinins; Drug Combinations; Drug Discovery; Parasitic Sensitivity Tests; Plasmodium falciparum; Plasmodium knowlesi,2-s2.0-85062216737

Materials and methods: A total of 40 patients were recruited, (mean age = 23 years) and were assigned to low and moderate caries risk groups (n = 20). Eighty occlusal surfaces of posterior teeth were examined for early caries lesion visually and using SoproLife? at baseline and at a recall visit six months later. At baseline visit, patients were given oral hygiene education, fluoridated toothpaste for homecare and topical fluoride application. SoproLife? images acquired were analysed using Image J software version 1.50. Difference in the mean value of intensity of the red wavelength spectrum between baseline and recall visits, (ΔI), were analysed for both risk groups. ΔI for upper and lower first molar teeth were also analysed. Results: Results show no statistical difference for ΔI between low and moderate risk groups (p = 0.13).

There is a need of reducing knee joint load and to improve balance and physical function among knee osteoarthritis patients. Objectives: To test the hypothesis that toe-out gait will reduce second peak knee adduction moment further and increase fall risk when combined with knee brace and laterally wedged insole in knee osteoarthritis patients. Study design: Single visit study with repeated measures. Methods: First and second peak knee adduction moments, fall risk and comfort level. First and second peak knee adduction moments were determined from three-dimensional gait analysis, completed under six randomized conditions: (1) natural, (2) knee brace, (3) knee brace + toe-out gait, (4) laterally wedged insole, (5) laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait, and (6) knee brace + laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait. Fall risk was assessed by Biodex Balance System using three randomized stability settings: (1) static, (2) moderate dynamic setting (FR12), and (3) high dynamic setting (FR8). Results: The reduction in first peak knee adduction moment and second peak knee adduction moment was greatest (7.16% and 25.55%, respectively) when toe-out gait combine with knee brace and laterally wedged insole. Significant increase in fall risk was observed with knee brace + laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait (42.85%) at FR12. Similar significant balance reductions were found at FR8 condition for knee brace + toe-out gait (35.71%), laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait (28.57%), and knee brace + laterally wedged insole + toe-out gait (50%) as compared to natural. However, knee brace decreased fall risk at FR12 by 28.57%. Conclusion: There is a synergistic effect of toe-out when combined with knee brace and laterally wedged insole concurrently in second peak knee adduction moment reduction but with a greater degree of fall risk. Simultaneous use of conservative treatments also decreases comfort level.

Purpose: To develop 3D personalized left ventricular (LV) models and thickening assessment framework for assessing regional wall thickening dysfunction and dyssynchrony in AMI patients. Study Type: Retrospective study, diagnostic accuracy. Subjects: Forty-four subjects consisting of 15 healthy subjects and 29 AMI patients. Field Strength/Sequence: 1.5T/steady-state free precession cine MRI scans; LGE MRI scans. Assessment: Quantitative thickening measurements across all cardiac phases were correlated and validated against clinical evaluation of infarct transmurality by an experienced cardiac radiologist based on the American Heart Association (AHA) 17-segment model. Statistical Test: Nonparametric 2-k related sample-based Kruskal–Wallis test; Mann–Whitney U-test; Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results: Healthy LV wall segments undergo significant wall thickening (P < 0.05) during ejection and have on average a thicker wall (8.73 ± 1.01 mm) compared with infarcted wall segments (2.86 ± 1.11 mm). Myocardium with thick infarct (ie, >50% transmurality) underwent remarkable wall thinning during contraction (thickening index [TI] = 1.46 ± 0.26 mm) as opposed to healthy myocardium (TI = 4.01 ± 1.04 mm). For AMI patients, LV that showed signs of thinning were found to be associated with a significantly higher percentage of dyssynchrony as compared with healthy subjects (dyssynchrony index [DI] = 15.0 ± 5.0% vs. 7.5 ± 2.0%, P < 0.01). Also, a strong correlation was found between our TI and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (r = 0.892, P < 0.01), and moderate correlation between DI and LVEF (r = 0.494, P < 0.01). Data Conclusion: The extracted regional wall thickening and DIs are shown to be strongly correlated with infarct severity, therefore suggestive of possible practical clinical utility.

Objectives: To estimate the perinatal mortality rate in Sana'a, Yemen and to identify risk factors for perinatal deaths. Methods: A community-based prospective cohort study was carried out between 2015 and 2016. Nine-hundred and eighty pregnant women were identified and followed up to 7 days following birth. A multi-stage cluster sampling was used to select participants from community households’, residing in the five districts of the Sana'a City, Yemen. Results: Total of 952 pregnant women were tracked up to 7 days after giving birth. The perinatal mortality rate, the stillbirth rate and the early neonatal mortality rate, were 89.3 per 1000, 46.2 per 1000 and 45.2 per 1000, respectively.

Subjects/methods: Using a crossover design, we conducted a randomised controlled trial in 53 free-living high-risk abdominally overweight subjects, comparing the effects of incorporating red palm olein (with palm olein as control) in a supervised isocaloric 2100 kcal diet of 30% en fat, two-thirds (45 g/day) of which were derived from the test oil for a period of 6 weeks each. Results: We did not observe a significant change in interleukin-6 (IL-6), in parallel with other pro-inflammatory (tumour necrosis factor-β, interleukin-1β, IL-1β, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, hsCRP) and endothelial function (soluble intercellular adhesion molecules, sICAM, soluble intravascular adhesion molecules, sVCAM) parameters. Interestingly, we observed a significant reduction in oxidised LDL levels (P < 0.0386) while on the red palm olein diet, together with the increase in plasma alpha tocopherol (P < 0.0002), alpha carotene (P < 0.0001) and beta carotene (P < 0.0001) concentrations compared with palm olein diet. Conclusion: Red palm olein did not improve subclinical inflammation and endothelial function despite profound increase in antioxidant levels.

The aim of this study was to determine adherence to the 2014 Malaysian Ministry of Health guidelines for managing suspected UTI in a Malaysian primary care setting. Methodology: We retrospectively reviewed computerized medical records of adults with suspected UTI between July-December 2016. Excluded were consultations misclassified by the search engine, duplicated records of the same patient, consultations for follow-up of suspected UTI, patients who were pregnant, catheterised, or who had a renal transplant. Records were reviewed by two primary care physicians and a clinical microbiologist. Results: From 852 records, 366 consultations were a fresh episode of possible UTI. Most subjects were female (78.2%) with median age of 61.5 years. The major co-morbidities were hypertension (37.1%), prostatic enlargement in males (35.5%) and impaired renal function (31.1%). Symptoms were reported in 349 (95.4%) consultations. Antibiotics were prescribed in 307 (83.9%) consultations, which was appropriate in 227/307 (73.9%), where the subject had at least one symptom, and leucocytes were raised in urine full examination and microscopic examination (UFEME). In 73 (23.8%) consultations antibiotics were prescribed inappropriately, as the subjects were asymptomatic (14,4.6%), urine was clear (17,5.5%), or UFEME did not show raised leucocytes (42,13.7%). In 7 (2.3%) consultations appropriateness of antibiotics could not be determined as UFEME was not available. Conclusion: Several pitfalls contributed to suboptimal adherence to guidelines for diagnosis and management of suspected UTI. This illustrates the complexity of managing suspected UTI in older subjects with multiple co-morbidities. ? 2019 Jackson et al.",Antibiotic stewardship; Asymptomatic bacteriuria; Diagnosis; Malaysia; Primary care; Urinary tract infection,amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; cefuroxime; ciprofloxacin; immunosuppressive agent; nitrofurantoin; adult; aged; Article; atrophic vaginitis; erythrocyte; female; follow up; general practitioner; human; hypertension; kidney function; leukocyte; male; microbiology; middle aged; pelvis cancer; practice guideline; pregnant woman; primary medical care; prostate hypertrophy; pyelonephritis; retrospective study; urinalysis; urinary tract infection; urine culture; urogenital tract cancer,2-s2.0-85064840985

Despite advancement in basic medical sciences, CKD-aP is still a major complication and a challenge for both physicians and patients to manage. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of CKD-aP among hemodialysis patients in Malaysia, to determine the impact of CKD-aP on sleep quality and any factors associated with CKD-aP. Method: A multi-centered, cross-sectional study design was conducted from February 2017 to September 2017 at a tertiary hospital and its affiliated dialysis centers, in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Included were patients > 18 years of age who were undergoing hemodialysis and could understand Malay. Participants were asked to fill the Malay 5D-itch scale and the Malay Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) upon recruitment. Results: A total of 334/334 patients were recruited (response rate = 100%). The majority were male (59.6%) and Chinese (61.7%). A total of 61.3% had pruritus, of which most patients (63.4%) reported that their pruritus was mild. More than half (54.1%) reported that they slept > 6 h, and 93.2% experienced no sleep disturbances during the night. However; the overall PSQI median score [IQR] was 6.0 [5.0-9.0]. No significant association was found between demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with the severity of pruritus. Patients with moderate to severe pruritus were found to be 5.47 times more likely to experience poor sleep quality as compared to patients with mild or no pruritus. Conclusion: In Malaysia, the prevalence of CKD-aP was 61.3%, of which the majority reported that their pruritus was mild.

Background: Vulnerable premature infants commonly require special care in the NICUs. In most cases, prolonged hospitalization results in stress and anxiety for the mothers. Methods: A non-probability convenience survey was used in a public hospital, with 180 mothers completing the 26-item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and a 40-item State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: 56.5% of mothers had high levels of stress, 85.5% of mothers had a high level of state-anxiety and 67.8% of mothers had a high level of trait-anxiety. The stress experienced by these mothers had a significant relationship with anxiety, and was found to be associated with state and trait anxiety levels, but not with maternal and infant characteristics. Conclusion: Mothers in this setting revealed high levels of stress and anxiety during their premature infants’ NICU admission.

This is because parents are often unable or unwilling to raise their own children. However, the debate around “grandparenting” is still limited in Indonesia. The purpose of this paper is to gain a better understanding of the experience and views of grandparents on “grandparenting.” Design/methodology/approach: The methodology employed was qualitative and informed by phenomenology. The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 13 grandparents who were raising their grandchildren who were under five years old. The data were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Findings: 5 main themes and 13 subthemes emerged from the analysis of the data. The themes were responses, strategies for overcoming negative responses, the grandparents’ role, the reason for raising grandchildren, and the cultural aspect of “grandparenting” in Java. All of the grandparents enjoyed their roles as grandparents. They felt that they helped fulfill their grandchildren’s physical and educational needs. Social implications: The experience of raising a grandchild can be both positive and negative, depending on the cultural aspects in the Java and the family as a whole system. Grandparents require healthcare and informal support to maintain their well-being. Originality/value: This paper provides new insights into “grandparenting” closely related to social and cultural aspect within the community. Grandparents enjoy being a part of the Javanese tradition. The supportive role of grandparents in Indonesia is important. However, older adults need to balance the role of “grandparenting” and rest time so that they remain healthy and happy. ? 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Experiences; Family; Grandchildren; Grandparent; Javanese; Older adult,aged; article; content analysis; grandchild; grandparent; human; Indonesia; interview; phenomenology; rest; wellbeing,2-s2.0-85058135554

P. blanda (family: Piperaceae) is from the genus Peperomia, and mostly found in Madagascar, Yemen, USA to South America, while L. socotranum (family: Plumbaginaceae) from the genus Limonium and this species is found only on Socotra Island, Yemen. These plants have attracted great interest in recent years because of their phytochemical contents. Consequently, the current study is aimed to investigate the phytochemical constituents, the cytotoxic and antimicrobial activities of L. socotranum (leaves and stem) and P. blanda extracts. Successive extraction had been performed which resulted in nine crude extracts. Phytochemical screening of the extracts was then conducted using qualitative chemical analysis. The antimicrobial activity of the plant extracts was determined using the well diffusion method against eleven selected pathogenic microbes and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) were measured. The cytotoxic activities of the plant extracts against MCF-7 and HepG2 cell lines were investigated using sulforhodamine B assay. It was noted that methanol leaves extract from L. socotranum exhibited higher antibacterial activity against Micrococcus luteus (MIC 15.6 μg/mL), Staphylococcus aureus (MIC 125 μg/mL) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC 125 μg/mL), than stem parts, while petroleum ether extract displayed stronger antifungal activity, with MIC of 125 μg/mL. On the other hand, petroleum ether extract of P. blanda was effective against Gram-positive bacteria and exhibited moderate antifungal activity. Petroleum ether extract of P. blanda displayed cytotoxic activity against MCF-7 cells, with an IC50 of 4.60 ± 0.02 μg/mL, while the methanol extracts showed higher activity against the HepG2 cell line, with an IC50 of 13.90 ± 0.14 μg/mL. Phytochemical findings confirmed the presence of flavonoids, alkaloids and terpenoids. The promising obtained results suggest the potential use of these plants in cancer and antimicrobial therapies. ? 2019, Malaysian Society for Parasitology. All rights reserved.",,,2-s2.0-85068006690

Co-infection of rickettsioses and malaria has been reported in Africa, where common reservoir and vectors are available. In this study, blood samples of Malaysian patients microscopically positive (n=148) and negative (n=88) for malaria parasites (Plasmodium knowlesi, Plasmodium malariae, Plasmodium falciparum, and Plasmodium vivax) were screened for the presence of rickettsial DNA, using PCR assays targeting specific genes. A partial fragment of rickettsial ompB gene was successfully amplified and sequenced from a patient microscopically positive for Plasmodium spp. and PCR-positive for P. vivax. BLAST analysis of the ompB sequence demonstrated the highest sequence similarity (99.7% similarity, 408/409nt) with Rickettsia sp. RF2125 (Genbank accession no.

Present study aims to investigate the genetic diversity of Plasmodium falciparum isolates in these two countries and eventually contributes to more effective malaria control strategies, particularly in vaccine and antimalarial treatment. One hundred and seventy three P. falciparum isolates were collected from Malaysia (n = 67) and Thailand (n = 106) and genotyped using nested PCR targeting the polymorphic region of MSP-1, block 2. Sequence analysis was conducted to investigate the allele diversity of the isolates. Three allelic families were identified in Malaysian and Thailand P. falciparum isolates, MAD20, K1 and RO33. Sequence analysis revealed that there were 5 different MAD20, 1 K1 and 2 different RO33 for Malaysian isolates. Thailand isolates exhibited greater polymorphism because there were 13 different MAD20, 6 different K1 and 2 different RO33 identified in this study. Multiclonal infections were observed for the isolates in both countries, however, low multiplicity of infection (MOI) was observed for Malaysian (1.1) and Thailand (1.2) isolates. Phylogenetic analysis showed that P. falciparum isolates of Malaysia and Thailand were clustered in the same group for all the allelic families. Population structure of P. falciparum isolates in Malaysia and Thailand exhibit extensive genetic polymorphism but showed high similarities as well as comparable MOI. ? 2019, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

The gains from schooling rise sharply with higher levels of education. The estimated returns are 12.2% in urban provinces and 10.7% in coastal provinces, higher than in rural and inland areas. In addition, the wage premium for workers with good English skills (speaking and listening) is 30%.

We describe a 21 year old Malaysian woman with pre-existing Takayasu arteritis confined to the large vessels, presenting one year later to our centre with status epilepticus. Extensive radiologic studies revealed diffuse encephalopathic changes and multifocal neurovascular involvement, with the vasculitis progressing to encompass the large, medium and small vessels. The patient was treated with high dose steroid therapy and discharged well with long term steroid and immunosuppressive therapy. Follow up MRI with vessel wall imaging sequence (VW-MR) and arterial spin labelling (ASL) perfusion imaging demonstrated intra and extracranial vessel wall inflammation, with generalized reduction in left sided cerebral blood flow.

Despite its in?vitro activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the effects of CTX preventive therapy on tuberculosis (TB) remain unclear. Methods: Adults living with HIV enrolled in a regional observational cohort in Asia who had initiated combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) were included in the analysis. Factors associated with new TB diagnoses after cohort entry and survival after cART initiation were analysed using Cox regression, stratified by site. Results: A total of 7355 patients from 12 countries enrolled into the cohort between 2003 and 2016 were included in the study. There were 368 reported cases of TB after cohort entry with an incidence rate of 0.99 per 100?person-years (/100?pys). Multivariate analyses adjusted for viral load (VL), CD4 count, body mass index (BMI) and cART duration showed that CTX reduced the hazard for new TB infection by 28% (HR 0.72, 95% CI l 0.56, 0.93). Mortality after cART initiation was 0.85/100?pys, with a median follow-up time of 4.63?years. Predictors of survival included age, female sex, hepatitis C co-infection, TB diagnosis, HIV VL, CD4 count and BMI. Conclusions: CTX was associated with a reduction in the hazard for new TB infection but did not impact survival in our Asian cohort. The potential preventive effect of CTX against TB during periods of severe immunosuppression should be further explored. ? 2019 The Authors.

These symptoms were also expressed among Blastocystis sp. infected individuals, a parasite commonly seen in human stools. This parasite has been previously reported to replicate faster upon exposure to high temperature. The present study is a hospitalized-based cross-sectional study involved the collection of faecal sample from dengue patients. Stool examination was done by in vitro cultivation to isolate Blastocystis sp. Growth pattern of all the positive isolates were analyzed to identify the multiplication rate of Blastocystis sp. isolated from dengue patients. Distribution of Blastocystis sp. among dengue patients was 23.6%. Dengue patients who were positive for Blastocystis sp. infection denoted a significantly higher fever rate reaching 38.73C (p<0.05) compared to the non-Blastocystis sp. infected patients (38.44C). It was also found that Blastocystis sp. infected patients complained of frequenting the toilet more than five times a day (p<0.05) compared to those who were non-Blastocystis sp. infected. At the same time, the duration of hospitalization was significantly longer (p<0.05) for Blastocystis sp. infected dengue patients compared to the non-Blastocystis sp. infected patients. Besides, Blastocystis sp. isolated from dengue patients (in vivo thermal stress) showed a higher growth rate compared to the non-dengue isolated which was exposed to high temperature (in vitro thermal stress). Our findings suggest that presence of Blastocystis sp. during dengue infection could trigger the increase of temperature which could be due to highly elevated pro inflammatory cytokines by both parasitic and virus infection. This could justify why the temperature in Blastocystis sp. infected dengue patients is higher compared to the non-Blastocystis sp. infected patients. Higher temperature could have triggered a greater parasite multiplication rate that contributed to the aggravation of the gastrointestinal symptoms. ? 2019 Thergarajan et al.

Others include central nervous system lymphoma (n = 7, 21%) and myelodysplastic syndrome (n = 1, 3%). Nonhematological malignancies were mostly Kaposi sarcoma (n = 12, 16%) and cervical cancer (n = 10, 14%). Risk factors for hematological malignancy included age >50 vs. ?30 years [subhazard ratio (SHR) = 6.48, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.79 to 23.43] and being from a high-income vs. a lower-middle-income country (SHR = 3.97, 95% CI: 1.45 to 10.84). Risk was reduced with CD4 351-500 cells/μL (SHR = 0.20, 95% CI: 0.05 to 0.74) and CD4 >500 cells/μL (SHR = 0.14, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.78), compared to CD4 ?200 cells/μL. Similar risk factors were seen for nonhematological malignancy, with prior AIDS diagnosis showing a weak association. Patients diagnosed with a hematological malignancy had shorter survival time compared to patients diagnosed with a nonhematological malignancy.Conclusions:Nonhematological malignancies were common but non-Hodgkin lymphoma was more predominant in our cohort. PLHIV from high-income countries were more likely to be diagnosed, indicating a potential underdiagnosis of cancer in low-income settings. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.",Asia; cancer; HIV; lymphoma; resource-limited,"acquired immune deficiency syndrome; adult; Article; Asia; Burkitt lymphoma; cancer incidence; CD4 lymphocyte count; cohort analysis; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; female; follow up; hematologic malignancy; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; immunoblastic lymphoma; Kaposi sarcoma; major clinical study; male; myelodysplastic syndrome; nonhodgkin lymphoma; priority journal; risk factor; survival time; uterine cervix cancer; complication; factual database; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; multivariate analysis; neoplasm; survival analysis; Adult; Asia; CD4 Lymphocyte Count; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; HIV Infections; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasms; Risk Factors; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-85061481888

Conventional cancer therapies, which rely on the generalized cytotoxic effect on rapidly dividing cells, may damage delicate organs in young children, leading to multiple late effects. Deep understanding of the biology of embryonal cancers is crucial in reshaping the cancer treatment paradigm for children.Recent findingsp53 plays a major physiological role in embryonic development, by controlling cell proliferation, differentiation and responses to cellular stress. Tumor suppressor function of p53 is commonly lost in adult cancers through genetic alterations. However, both somatic and germline p53 mutations are rare in childhood blastomas, suggesting that in these cancers, p53 may be inactivated through other mechanisms than mutation. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about p53 pathway inactivation in childhood blastomas (specifically neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma and Wilms' tumor) through various upstream mechanisms. Laboratory evidence and clinical trials of targeted therapies specific to exploiting p53 upstream regulators are discussed.SummaryDespite the low rate of inherent TP53 mutations, p53 pathway inactivation is a common denominator in childhood blastomas. Exploiting p53 and its regulators is likely to translate into more effective targeted therapies with minimal late effects for children.

A number of these pathogens are also known to be zoonotic and are of public health concern. Despite the importance of these enteric protozoa to both animal and human health, there remains a paucity of published information on the epidemiological risk factors that may be associated with bovine cryptosporidiosis in Southeast Asia. The present study was undertaken to determine the molecular prevalence and associated risk factors for Cryptosporidium infection among beef and dairy cattle in Peninsular Malaysia. Faecal samples were collected from 824 cattle in 39 farms (526 beef and 298 dairy) situated in 33 locations throughout the country, and subjected to PCR detection for Cryptosporidium using primers targeting the 18S SSUrRNA gene. Epidemiological variables including host, environment and management factors were subjected to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to determine the potential risk factors for infection. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium among the cattle was 12.5%, with significant difference in the infection rate among the various breeds. There was no significant effect of gender, and both the beef and dairy cattle were at similar odds for infection. The younger cattle had a significantly higher infection rate compared to the older animals. Multivariate analysis revealed that deworming practice, distance to human settlement, geographical location (zone) and farm management system were significant risk factors associated with Cryptosporidium infection. The cattle that were reared on farms located in the northeast of the country, closest (?200 m) to human settlements, reared extensively, and dewormed every four months were at highest risk of infection. The present study constitutes the first attempt to analyze the multivariable epidemiological risk factors involved in bovine cryptosporidiosis in Malaysia and in Southeast Asia. It is envisaged that the data obtained will facilitate better control and prevention measures for Cryptosporidium infection among cattle in the region. Due to the potential zoonotic nature of the infection, serious steps should be instituted for animal treatment and biohazard waste management on local cattle farms. ? 2019",Cattle; Cryptosporidium; Peninsular Malaysia; Risk factors,antihelminthic therapy; Article; beef cattle; Brahman cattle; cattle breed; controlled study; cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; dairy cattle; enteropathogen; feces analysis; female; herd; infection rate; infection risk; Malaysia; male; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal,2-s2.0-85061015351

The disease is caused by the Pasteurella multocida serotype B:2 bacteria. P. multocida B:2 has high mortality and morbidity rates and is spread through the intranasal and oral routes in bovines. In this study, our aim was to investigate the efficacy of the recombinant protein vaccine, ABA392/pET30a via intranasal inoculation by targeting the mucosal immunity. The constructed recombinant protein vaccine ABA392/pET30a was subjected to an animal study using Sprague Dawley rats. The study was divided into two parts: active and passive immunization studies. Both studies were carried out through the determination of immunogenicity (using Total White Blood Cell (TWBC) Count with Indirect ELISA) and histopathogenicity, analyzing (Bronchus Associated Lymphoid Tissue (BALT) formation) in lungs. As a result, the IgA and IgG development of both tested groups: group 1 (50μg/mL protein vaccine) and group 2 (100μg/mL protein vaccine) showed equivalent with the positive control group 4 (formalin-killed P. multocida B:2). However, there was a significant difference when compared with the negative control group 3 (normal saline). These results demonstrate that both the protein vaccine at the concentration 50μg/mL and 100μg/mL have the same efficacy as the commercially available positive control vaccine. From the studies, higher concentration of protein vaccine at 100μg/mL showed higher development of both IgA and IgG compared to 50μg/mL protein vaccine. Higher and rapid development of IgA compared to IgG showed that mucosal immunity has been induced through the intranasal administration of the protein vaccine. In addition, leucocytosis was observed at each dose of vaccination showed that the protein vaccine is capable to induce the immune responses of the host. Histopathogenicity studies of the vaccinated groups showed more BALT formation and no severe lesions after challenge compared to the negative control group. Besides, no inflammatory onsite or anaphylactic responses were observed after the intranasal inoculation which proved to be safer and provided longer lasting immunity. Therefore, recombinant protein vaccine ABA392/pET30a could be a potential candidate for intranasal administration which can provoke mucosal immunity against HS disease. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Haemorrhagic septicaemia; Histopathogenicity; Immunogenicity; Mucosal immunity; Pasteurella multocida,"immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; peptide vaccine; recombinant vaccine; sodium chloride; bacterial protein; bacterial vaccine; bacterium antibody; immunoglobulin A; immunoglobulin G; recombinant protein; recombinant vaccine; active immunization; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioinformatics; controlled study; drug efficacy; drug purification; drug safety; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; hemorrhagic septicemia; immune response; immunogenicity; leukocyte count; leukocytosis; mucosal immunity; nonhuman; passive immunization; Pasteurella multocida; priority journal; rat; animal; blood; bovine; bronchus; disease model; genetics; hemorrhagic septicemia; immunology; intranasal drug administration; lymphoid tissue; microbiology; pathology; Sprague Dawley rat; vaccination; vaccine immunogenicity; Administration, Intranasal; Animals; Antibodies, Bacterial; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Vaccines; Bronchi; Cattle; Disease Models, Animal; Hemorrhagic Septicemia; Immunity, Mucosal; Immunization, Passive; Immunogenicity, Vaccine; Immunoglobulin A; Immunoglobulin G; Lymphoid Tissue; Pasteurella multocida; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Recombinant Proteins; Vaccination; Vaccines, Synthetic",2-s2.0-85059122419

Despite the substantial benefits of physical activity for healthy aging, older adults are considered the most physically inactive segment of the Malaysian population. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of physical inactivity among older adults in Malaysia and its correlates. We analysed data on adults aged ?60 years (n = 3790) from the National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2015, a cross-sectional, nationwide population-based survey covering information on socio-demographic characteristics, physical activity and other lifestyle-related variables, health conditions, and functional limitations. Individuals included in this study were classified as physically active or physically inactive. Logistic regression was used to determine factors associated with physical inactivity. The overall prevalence of physical inactivity among older adults aged ?60 years old was 48.8%. Physical inactivity was significantly more prevalent among females, older age groups, Indians, those being single/widowed/divorced, those with no formal education, those who reported high sedentary time (?7 h/day), those with diabetes, anaemia, and functional limitations (p < 0.001). In fully adjusted analyses, females, older age, high household income (?MYR4000), inadequate fruits and vegetables consumption (<5 servings/day), high sedentary time, having diabetes, and having mobility impairment were all associated with physical inactivity. Approximately half of the Malaysian older population are physically inactive. Identifying the correlates of physical inactivity among Malaysian older adults will help to develop public health policies and interventions that encourage active living among older people and promote healthy aging in Malaysia. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Malaysia; National Heath and Morbidity Survey; Older adults; Physical inactivity; Prevalence,"age distribution; aged; Article; cognitive defect; communication disorder; diabetes mellitus; divorced person; educational status; female; fruit; hearing impairment; household income; human; Indian; Malaysian; male; physical inactivity; prevalence; priority journal; sex ratio; single (marital status); sitting; unhealthy diet; vegetable; very elderly; visual impairment; walking difficulty; widowed person; age; anemia; cross-sectional study; diabetes mellitus; diet; health survey; income; Malaysia; marriage; middle aged; sex factor; Age Factors; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anemia; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet; Educational Status; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Income; Malaysia; Male; Marital Status; Middle Aged; Mobility Limitation; Prevalence; Sedentary Behavior; Sex Factors",2-s2.0-85057560138

Data on risk habits (smoking, drinking, chewing) were obtained using a structured questionnaire via face-to-face interviews. Multiple logistic regression was used to determine association between risk habits and oral cancer risk; chi-square test was used to assess association between risk habits and ethnicity. Population attributable risks were calculated for all habits. Results: Except for alcohol consumption, increased risk was observed for all habits; the highest risk was for smoking?+?chewing?+?drinking (aOR 22.37 95% CI 5.06, 98.95). Significant ethnic differences were observed in the practice of habits. The most common habit among Malays was smoking (24.2%); smoking?+?drinking were most common among Chinese (16.8%), whereas chewing was the most prevalent among Indians (45.2%) and Indigenous people (24.8%). Cessation of chewing, smoking and drinking is estimated to reduce cancer incidence by 22.6%, 8.5% and 6.9%, respectively. Conclusion: Ethnic variations in the practice of oral cancer risk habits are evident. Betel quid chewing is the biggest attributable factor for this population. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Twelve items relating to sexual and reproductive health were used to measure respondents' knowledge based on their responses 'True', 'False' or 'Don't know', with the proportion of correct answers being the variable of interest. Cronbach's alpha for the twelve items was 0.761 and the mean knowledge score was 6.8. While the majority of the respondents knew that a woman can get pregnant if she has sex with a man and that HIV and AIDS can be transmitted through sexual intercourse, knowledge about Malaysia's abortion laws, that a woman can get pregnant if she has sex only once and that people with sexually transmitted infections may look healthy was poor. Older respondents and those from urban schools reported significantly higher knowledge than younger respondents and those from rural schools, respectively. More emphasis should be given in schools to the specific topics for which low levels of sexual and reproductive health knowledge were found, with greater attention being given to younger adolescents and those in rural areas. ? 2018 Cambridge University Press.",,,2-s2.0-85049576278

The purpose of this systematic review is to compile the evidence from observational and intervention studies among Malaysian adolescents to evaluate the associations between diet and physical activity (PA) as determinants of cardio-metabolic risk factors. Methods: A systematic search of Medline via the PubMed, Science Direct, Cochrane Review and Web of Science databases was conducted for studies on the associations between diet and PA factors and cardio-metabolic risk factors among Malaysian adolescents aged 13-18 years that were published until 31 August 2017. The search results were independently screened and extracted by two reviewers. Results: From over 2,410 references retrieved, 20 full texts articles were screened as potentially relevant. Seventeen (16 cross-sectional and one intervention) met the inclusion criteria for data extraction and analysis. All 17 studies were rated as poor quality and the majority had made insufficient adjustment for confounders. As regards the effect of diet and PA on cardio-metabolic health, the intakes of energy (n = 4) and macronutrients (n = 3) and meal frequency (n = 5) were the most commonly studied dietary factors, while the PA score and level were the most commonly studied PA factors. In addition, BMI and body weight were the most common cardio-metabolic health outcomes. The studies showed that obese and overweight adolescents consume significantly more energy and macronutrients. They are also more likely to skip their daily meals compared to their normal weight peers. In most studies, the direction of the PA effect on body weight was unclear. Some studies found that higher PA is associated with a lower risk of overweight and obesity. However, the associations are often small or inconsistent, with few studies controlling for confounding factors. Conclusions: This review identified a lack of evidence and well-conducted prospective studies on the effect of diet and PA on cardio-metabolic health of Malaysian adolescents. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Cardio-metabolic; Dietary patterns; Malaysian adolescents; Physical activity; Systematic review,adolescent; adolescent behavior; cross-sectional study; eating; exercise; feeding behavior; female; health status; human; Malaysia; male; physiology; prospective study; psychology; risk factor; Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior; Cross-Sectional Studies; Eating; Exercise; Feeding Behavior; Female; Health Status; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85062360891

Larval bioassay was performed in accordance with the World Health Organization standard protocol. Field-collected and reference strains of Ae. aegypti larvae were tested against diagnostic doses of eight larvicides belonging to organophosphates and organochlorines, namely bromophos (0.050 mg/liter), chlopyrifos (0.002 mg/liter), fenitrothion (0.020 mg/liter), fenthion (0.025 mg/liter), malathion (0.125 mg/liter), temephos (0.012 mg/liter), DDT (0.012 mg/liter), and dieldrin (0.025 mg/liter). Mortality rates of larvae were recorded at 24-h posttreatment. This study showed that Ae. aegypti larvae from Padang, Samarinda, Manggarai Barat, and South Central Timor were susceptible to both fenitrothion and dieldrin (mortality rates ? 98%). About 6 out of 10 field strains of Ae. aegypti larvae were resistant (<80% mortality rates) against fenthion, whereas Ae. aegypti larvae from Kuningan, Samarinda, Sumba, and South Central Timor exhibited some degrees of resistance (mortality rates 80-98%). All field-collected Ae. aegypti larvae were resistant against diagnostic doses of chlorpyrifos, malathion, temephos, and DDT with mortality rates ranging from 0 to 74.67%.

This study describes the identification and growth characteristics of a R. felis-like organism (designated as Rickettsia sp. TH2014) cultured from Ctenocephalides orientis fleas in rural Malaysia. In this study, culturing of rickettsiae from filtered triturated flea lysates was performed in Aedes albopictus C6/36 cells. Cytopathic effects were observed from one of the samples 4 d post-inoculation. Electron microscopy revealed actively replicating intracytosolic coccobacillary organisms in the rickettsia-infected cells. Sequence analysis of amplified citrate synthase (gltA) gene fragment shows complete match of the rickettsia with Rickettsia sp. Rf31 in Southeast Asia, and 'Candidatus Rickettsia senegalensis' strain PU01-02 in Africa. The whole-genome sequence of Rickettsia sp. TH2014 was determined and assembled. The estimated genome size and guanine + cytosine content of the rickettsia are 1.37 Mb and 32.9%, respectively. The high values of average nucleotide identity and tetra-nucleotide signature correlation index obtained from pairwise genome comparison study suggest the identification of the rickettsia as R. felis. The whole-genome single-nucleotide polymorphism analysis demonstrates close genetic relatedness of the rickettsia with R. felis and Rickettsia asemboensis. However, based on sequence analyses of rickettsial genes (16S rDNA, gltA, ompB, and sca4), Rickettsia sp. TH2014 is found to be distinct from R. felis and R. asemboensis. The sequence analyses reveal that Rickettsia sp. TH2014 is highly similar to 'Ca. Rickettsia senegalensis' detected in fleas from Africa, Asia, and North America. Further investigation to provide insights on pathogenic potential and transmission dynamics of the rickettsia is warranted. ? The Author(s) 2018.

Methods: This was a cross-sectional study that included 680 respondents from community housing projects. Reported PA was assessed using the Global Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPAQ) short form version 2. The SF-12v2 was administered to assess the health-related QoL (HRQoL) among the study population. Respondents were grouped into “active” and “insufficient” groups according to reported weekly PA level. One-way analysis of variance, analysis of co-variance, and multiple linear regression were used in the analysis. Results: Overall, 17.6% (95% CI, 14.3-20.9) of the respondents did not achieve the recommended levels of PA (?600 metabolic equivalent [MET]-minutes week -1 ). Level of achieving recommended PA was higher among younger participants, females, members belonging to nuclear families, and in self-employed participants. The group that fulfilled recommended PA levels (active) has higher levels of QoL in all domains except physical functioning. Conclusions: Almost one out of five low-income urban residents were physically inactive. In addition, individuals who attained recommended PA levels had better scores on some domains of HRQOL than those who did not.

Hence, the global emergence of metronidazole resistance in Hp poses a major challenge to health professionals. Inactivation of RdxA is known to be a major mechanism of conferring metronidazole resistance in H. pylori. However, metronidazole resistance can also arise in H. pylori strains expressing functional RdxA protein, suggesting that there are other mechanisms that may confer resistance to this drug. Methods: We performed whole-genome sequencing on 121 H. pylori clinical strains, among which 73 were metronidazole-resistant. Sequence-alignment analysis of core protein clusters derived from clinical strains containing full-length RdxA was performed. Variable sites in each alignment were statistically compared between the resistant and susceptible groups to determine candidate genes along with their respective amino-acid changes that may account for the development of metronidazole resistance in H. pylori. Results: Resistance due to RdxA truncation was identified in 34% of metronidazole-resistant strains. Analysis of core protein clusters derived from the remaining 48 metronidazole-resistant strains and 48 metronidazole-susceptible identified four variable sites significantly associated with metronidazole resistance. These sites included R16H/C in RdxA, D85N in the inner-membrane protein RclC (HP0565), V265I in a biotin carboxylase protein (HP0370) and A51V/T in a putative threonylcarbamoyl-AMP synthase (HP0918). Conclusions: Our approach identified new potential mechanisms for metronidazole resistance in H. pylori that merit further investigation. ? The Author(s) 2019.

We assessed the influence of geographical location, ethnicity and gender on the various trigger factors of a migraine and a TTH. We also evaluated the trigger factors among the multi-ethnic Southeast Asian adult patients. In a recent study, odor triggered more migrainous headaches compared to the other primary headaches. Odor was observed to be specific of migraines. Moreover, stress is one of the most common trigger factors for patients with migraines and TTHs worldwide. Migrainous patients have an increased sensitivity in comparison to non-migrainous patients. Furthermore, these patients have much difficulty in adapting to the high level of sensitivity, and the sensitized brain is therefore more vulnerable to trigger factors. In addition, the presence of one trigger factor may increase the exposure of other trigger factors. This phenomenon is more marked in the patients with migraines who have stress and menstruation as triggers, predisposing them to be more sensitive to other triggers. In conclusion, the geographical location factor has an influence on the trigger factors of headaches. Ethnicity may have an effect due to the cultural differences. Change in weather and sunlight are important commonly identified trigger factors for headaches. Moreover, gender differences in some trigger factors are present among the patients with headaches, especially sunlight and sleep deprivation. More research studies can be conducted to have a better understanding on trigger factors in the future. This will enable proper identification of trigger factors, leading to a decrease in the number of headache episodes and an improvement in quality of life for patients. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",L Headache; Migraine; Tension-type; Trigger factors,disease predisposition; environmental factor; episodic migraine; ethnic difference; geography; human; menstruation; migraine; noise; odor; quality of life; Review; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; sex difference; sleep deprivation; Southeast Asian; stress; sunlight; tension headache; transformed migraine; weather; migraine; socioeconomics; tension headache; Geography; Humans; Migraine Disorders; Precipitating Factors; Socioeconomic Factors; Tension-Type Headache,2-s2.0-85061986619

The parasites’ growth characteristics, apoptotic rate, specific protease activity and the ability to proliferate cancer cells were analyzed upon treatment with 0.001 mg/l metronidazole. The study demonstrates that Blastocystis sp. isolates showed increase in the parasite numbers especially the amoebic forms (only in urban isolates) after treating with metronidazole at the concentration of 0.001 mg/ml. High number of cells in post-treated isolates coincided with increase of apoptosis. There was a significant increase in cysteine protease of Blastocystis sp. isolates upon treatment despite the initial predominance of serine protease in asymptomatic isolates. Metronidazole resistant Blastocystis sp. also showed significant increase in cancer cell proliferation. Resistance to metronidazole did not show significant different influence on the pathogenicity between Blastocystis sp. isolated from urban and orang asli individual. However, an increase in parasite numbers, higher amoebic forms, cysteine protease and ability to proliferate cancer cells implicates a pathogenic role. The study provides evidence for the first time, the effect of metronidazole towards enhancing pathogenic potentials in Blastocystis sp. when isolated from different gut environment. This necessitates the need for reassessment of metronidazole treatment modalities. ? 2019 Rajamanikam et al.

Materials and Methods: We used self-administered questionnaires to investigate the attitude of 382 health care professionals from the University of Malaya Medical Center between January and February 2014. The responses were analyzed using logistic regression. Results: Of the 382 respondents, 175 (45.8%) stated that they would officially object to organ donation if the presumed consent system were to be imple - mented, whereas the remaining 207 (54.2%) stated that they would not object. The logistic regression showed that health care professionals from the Malay ethnic group were more likely to object than those from Chinese (adjusted odds ratio of 0.342; P =.001) and Indian and other (adjusted odds ratio of 0.341; P =.003) ethnic groups. Health care professionals earning 3000 Malaysian Ringgit or below were more likely to object than those earning above 3000 Malaysian Ringgit (adjusted odds ratio of 1.919; P =.006). Moreover, respondents who were initially unwilling to donate organs, regardless of the donation system, were more likely to object under the presumed consent system than those who were initially willing to donate (adjusted odds ratio of 2.765; P <.001). Conclusions: Health care professionals in Malaysia have a relatively negative attitude toward the presumed consent system, which does not encourage the implementation of this system in the country at present. To pave the way for a successful implementation of the presumed consent system, efforts should be initiated to enhance the attitude of health care professionals toward this system. In particular, these efforts should at most target the health care professionals who are Malay, earn a low income, and have a negative default attitude toward deceased donation. ?

Methods: Adult and larval mosquitos were collected for surveillance. Susceptibility status of Anopheles was determined using the standard WHO adult bioassay, larval bioassay and biochemical enzyme assay. Results: WHO adult bioassay results indicated An. cracens collected from Kampung Sungai Ular, Pahang was resistant towards 4% DDT, while An. maculatus collected from Kampung Sokor, Kelantan and Kampung Sungai Lui, Selangor exhibited resistance towards 4% DDT. However, the enzyme activity profiles varied according to strains and species. The resistance ratio of larval bioassay, showed that all strains and species tested were susceptible to malathion and temephos. Conclusions: Since only a few anopheline strains exhibited low level of insecticide resistance towards malathion, DDT and temephos. These insecticides are still considered effective for vector control program towards An. cracens and An. maculatus. ? 2019 Asian Pacific Journal of Tropical Medicine Produced by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.",Biochemical enzyme assay; Insecticide susceptibility; Vector control; WHO adult bioassay,acetylcholinesterase; chlorphenotane; deltamethrin; glutathione transferase; malathion; nonspecific esterase; temefos; unspecific monooxygenase; adult; Anopheles; Anopheles cracens; Anopheles maculatus; Article; bioassay; biochemical analysis; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; female; insect larva; insecticide resistance; larvicidal activity; LC50; Malaysia; nonhuman; Plasmodium knowlesi malaria; priority journal; vector control; World Health Organization,2-s2.0-85061100357

Previous studies have yielded conflicting results, have lacked sufficient statistical power to assess many lymphoma subtypes, or have lacked detailed information on relevant exposures. Within the European Prospective Investigation Into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, we analyzed comprehensive data on reproductive factors and exogenous hormone use collected at baseline (1992-2000) among 343,458 women, including data on 1,427 incident cases of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and its major subtypes identified after a mean follow-up period of 14 years (through 2015). We estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals using multivariable proportional hazards modeling. Overall, we observed no statistically significant associations between parity, age at first birth, breastfeeding, oral contraceptive use, or ever use of postmenopausal hormone therapy and risk of B-cell NHL or its subtypes. Women who had undergone surgical menopause had a 51% higher risk of B-cell NHL (based on 67 cases) than women with natural menopause (hazard ratio = 1.51, 95% confidence interval: 1.17, 1.94). Given that this result may have been due to chance, our results provide little support for the hypothesis that sex hormones play a role in lymphomagenesis. ?

This will include modifications through hand, scanning and digital imaging of software. The aim of this study is to determine the circumferential profiles and conduct a volumetric analysis of a conventional socket that has fabrication using biosculptor technology. In doing this, a male transtibial amputee, age 28 years old with stable health condition was studied, where circumferential measurements were taken at intervals of 1 cm from the distal end of the residual limb to the medial tibial plateau level. Furthermore, the interior volume of both sockets and residuum were determined directly using water displacement method. A comparative value for the calculation of volume was also carried out using engineering mathematical equations. From these measurements, a total surface bearing transtibial sockets was fabricated to compare the changes of circumferential values of both sockets. The finding shows a percentage of the difference between the volume of the residual limb and conventional sockets to be 6.09%, whereas the biosculptor fabrication socket was 7.84% using the water displacement method. A comparison of circumferential profiles and volumetric analysis findings on the contrary showed that socket fabricated using the biosculptor technology is interchangeable with the conventional socket with more advantages, where biosculptor technology produces cheaper sockets and faster process with digital function in the procedure, unlike the conventional manual technique. ?

We report here the bacterial communities associated with field-caught male and female adult flies from University Malaya campus. The microbiota was determined by targeted 16S rRNA gene (V3–V4 region) sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq. At 97% similarity, four bacterial phyla (with relative abundance of ?1% in at least one specimen) – Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Tenericutes – were recovered from the adult flies. Proteobacteria was the predominant phylum in all the samples, with the female flies (86.81 ± 6.57%) having higher mean relative abundance than the male flies (71.57 ± 18.37%). The Firmicutes was more abundant in the male flies (14.47 ± 17.30%) than female flies (0.69 ± 1.25%). There were in total seven classes, nine orders, 13 families, 23 genera, and 31 putative species. Thirteen genera had higher mean relative abundance in male flies, and nine in female flies. Klebsiella was the predominant genus in female flies, while Desulfovibrio was more abundant in some male flies. The mean relative abundances of the putative species Orbus sasakiae and Enterococcus moraviensis were significantly higher in male than female flies, while female flies had significantly higher mean relative abundance for Escherichia fergusonii and Klebsiella variicola. Alpha diversity indices indicated that the bacterial diversity varied within and between male and female flies, and the mean bacterial diversity was significantly higher in male flies. The differences in bacterial diversity and relative abundance may be reasonably attributed to stochastic processes, in part to environmental factors such as food resources and habitats. It is significant that several putative bacterial species recovered in the present study have not been reported in Bactrocera fruit flies. Sixteen of the 31 detected putative bacterial species are potential opportunistic pathogens of medical/public health importance. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Bacterial communities; Bactrocera carambolae; Microbiota; Potential opportunistic pathogens; Wild fruit fly,RNA 16S; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Bacteroidetes; Bactrocera; Bactrocera carambolae; bioinformatics; Chlamydiae; Desulfovibrio; Desulfovibrionaceae; Desulfovibrionales; DNA extraction; Enterobacter; Escherichia; female; Firmicutes; Flavobacteriaceae; Gammaproteobacteria; gene sequence; Klebsiella; male; microbial community; microflora; Mollicutes; nonhuman; Porphyromonadaceae; priority journal; Proteobacteria; Rhodospirillales,2-s2.0-85058464932

Methods: The forward-backward and dual-panel versions of HeartQoL were self-administered among 60 participants who met the inclusion criteria of being a native Bahasa Malaysia-speaking Malay, aged 18 and older, having an indexed diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease and being cognitively fit. The administration sequence of the two versions was randomized. Additionally, three sociolinguists, who were blinded to translation processes and survey findings, rated the translated versions against the source version on three aspects of semantic equivalence. Results: Textual content in both translated versions was considerably similar (n?=?9/14 items, ?64%). The overall results from weighted kappa, raw agreement, intraclass correlations, and Wilcoxon signed-rank as well as experts' ratings were confirmative of semantic equivalence between the forward-backward and dual-panel versions of the HeartQoL. However, some mixed findings were indicative of potential gaps in both translated versions against the source version. Conclusion: Both the forward-backward and dual-panel methods produced semantically equivalent versions of HeartQoL; but translation alone is insufficient to narrow the subtle gaps caused by differences in culture and linguistic style. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",cardiac nursing; coronary heart disease; health-related quality of life; patient-reported outcome measures; surveys and questionnaires; translation,coronary artery disease; female; human; Malaysia; male; middle aged; psychology; publication; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; Coronary Disease; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Translations,2-s2.0-85058006430

One such innovative idea would be to assess combination therapeutic treatments – by way of combining two potentially effective and very different therapy. Previously, we have shown that DHODH inhibitors, A771726 and Brequinar sodium (BQR) induced cell growth impairment in melanoma cells. Similar results were seen with DHODH RNA interference (shRNA). In the present study, we showed that combination of BQR with doxorubicin resulted in synergistic and additive cell growth inhibition in these cells. In addition, in vivo studies with this combination of drugs demonstrated an almost 90% tumor regression in nude mice bearing melanoma tumors. Cell cycle regulatory proteins, cyclin B 1 and its binding partner pcdc-2 and p21 were significantly downregulated and upregulated respectively following the combined treatment. Given that we have observed synergistic effects with BQR and doxorubicin, both in vitro and in vivo, these drugs potentially represent a new combination in the targeted therapy of melanoma. ? 2018 The Authors",A375; Brequinar; Cyclin B 1; Doxorubicin; In vivo; p21; pcdc-2,"brequinar; cyclin B1; doxorubicin; n [3 (5 chloro 1h pyrrolo[2,3 b]pyridine 3 carbonyl) 2,4 difluorophenyl]propanesulfonamide; protein p21; antineoplastic agent; biphenyl derivative; brequinar; doxorubicin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cancer inhibition; combination drug therapy; controlled study; down regulation; drug potentiation; in vitro study; in vivo study; melanoma; mouse; myeloma; nonhuman; priority journal; single drug dose; tumor regression; tumor xenograft; upregulation; animal; dose response; drug effect; drug potentiation; drug screening; human; melanoma; nude mouse; pathology; physiology; procedures; tumor cell line; tumor volume; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents; Antineoplastic Combined Chemotherapy Protocols; Biphenyl Compounds; Cell Line, Tumor; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Doxorubicin; Drug Synergism; Humans; Melanoma; Mice; Mice, Nude; Tumor Burden; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85056650604

Background: Mothers of premature infants may face stress having premature infants, and their infants may be admitted to the NICU for a few weeks or months. The mothers’ experience of stress would be worse if they have low knowledge and poor NICU-related maternal ability. Mothers of infants admitted to the NICU require well-planned interventions to cope with psychological matters arising after an infant hospitalisation. Design: Quasi-experimental design. Methods: A total of 216 mothers were consecutively assigned to control and intervention groups. Each group consisted of 108 mothers. The mothers in both groups received questionnaire concerning maternal stress and NICU-related ability during their first visit to NICU (within 48?hr of admission). A structured nursing intervention was implemented for 10?days on mothers in the intervention group. The control group continued to receive existing practice nursing care. Mothers of both groups were again given the questionnaire on maternal stress and NICU-related ability after 14?days of admission. Results: In the intervention group, the difference between the mean total score of maternal stress and parental role and relationship subscale decreased significantly, compared to the control group (p?=?0.04; p?=?0.01) respectively. Maternal ability improved significantly in mothers in the intervention group 2?weeks postintervention, p?<?0.001. Conclusion: A structured nursing intervention for mothers could significantly reduce maternal stress and promote maternal NICU-related abilities. Relevance to clinical practice: The results of the study could help neonatal nurses to develop an appropriate nursing intervention for parents with premature infants in the NICU. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",maternal ability; maternal stress; mothers; neonatal; nursing intervention; premature infant,"adult; attitude to health; case control study; controlled clinical trial (topic); female; gestational age; human; infant; male; mental stress; mother; neonatal intensive care unit; newborn; nursing; prematurity; prevention and control; psychology; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Female; Gestational Age; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Intensive Care Units, Neonatal; Male; Mothers; Non-Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85054543498

Methods: A 3-step framework was proposed, consisting of: (1) 3D LV model reconstruction from motion-corrected 4D cine-MRI; (2) Registration of 2D LGE-MRI with 4D cine-MRI; (3) LV contour extraction from the intersection of LGE slices with the LV model. The framework was evaluated against cardiac MRI data from 27 patients scanned within 6 months after acute myocardial infarction. We compared the use of local Pearson's correlation (LPC) and normalized mutual information (NMI) as similarity measures for the registration. The use of 2 and 6 long-axis (LA) cine-MRI scans was also compared. The accuracy of the framework was evaluated using manual segmentation, and the interobserver variability of the scar volume derived from the segmented LV was determined using Bland-Altman analysis. Results: LPC outperformed NMI as a similarity measure for the proposed framework using 6 LA scans, with Hausdorrf distance (HD) of 1.19 ± 0.53 mm versus 1.51 ± 2.01 mm (endocardial) and 1.21 ± 0.48 mm versus 1.46 ± 1.78 mm (epicardial), respectively. Segmentation using 2 LA scans was comparable to 6 LA scans with a HD of 1.23 ± 0.70 mm (endocardial) and 1.25 ± 0.74 mm (epicardial). The framework yielded a lower interobserver variability in scar volumes compared with manual segmentation. Conclusion: The framework showed high accuracy and robustness in delineating LV in LGE-MRI and allowed for bidirectional mapping of information between LGE- and cine-MRI scans, crucial in personalized model studies for treatment planning. ? 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",image segmentation; late gadolinium enhanced (LGE) MRI; multimodal image registration; myocardial infarction; patient-specific modelling,"gadolinium; gadolinium; acute heart infarction; Article; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; clinical article; endocardium; epicardium; four dimensional imaging; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle infarction; human; image analysis; image reconstruction; image segmentation; imaging and display; measurement accuracy; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; three dimensional imaging; treatment planning; two-dimensional imaging; algorithm; chemistry; computer simulation; diagnostic imaging; heart infarction; heart ventricle; image processing; motion; observer variation; prognosis; radiotherapy planning system; reproducibility; Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Gadolinium; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Motion; Myocardial Infarction; Observer Variation; Prognosis; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Reproducibility of Results",2-s2.0-85053547170

Based on the global health transition judgement, 62.3% of parents reported their child's oral condition to be “a little improved” while 37.7% reported it to be “much improved” following treatment, with Malay-ECOHIS mean change scores of 6.7 (ES?=?+1.1) and 9.6 (ES?=?+1.2), respectively. There was an observed gradient in the Malay-ECOHIS change scores and ES in relation to parents’ perception of their child's oral health improvement after treatment, supporting the responsiveness of the measure. The Malay-ECOHIS MID was found to be 7 scale points.

We previously identified that MAGED4B and FJX1 proteins are overexpressed in HNSCC patients; and further demonstrated that two HLA-A2-restricted 9–11 amino acid peptides derived from these proteins were able to induce anti-tumour immune responses in vitro independently using PBMCs isolated from these patients. In this study, we evaluated the immunogenicity and efficacy of a dual-antigenic peptide vaccine (PV1), comprised of MAGED4B and FJX1 peptides in HNSCC patients. We first demonstrated that 94.8% of HNSCC patients expressed MAGED4B and/or FJX1 by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that PV1 could benefit the majority of HNSCC patients. The presence of pre-existing MAGED4B and FJX1-specific T-cells was detected using a HLA-A2 dimer assay and efficacy of PV1 to induce T-cell to secrete cytotoxic cytokine was evaluated using ELISPOT assay. Pre-existing PV1-specific T-cells were detected in all patients. Notably, we demonstrated that patients’ T-cells were able to secrete cytotoxic cytokines upon exposure to target cells expressing the respective antigen post PV1 stimulation. Furthermore, patients with high expression of MAGED4B and FJX1 in their tumours were more responsive to PV1 stimulation, demonstrating the specificity of the PV1 peptide vaccine. Additionally, we also demonstrated the expression of MAGED4B and FJX1 in breast, lung, colon, prostate and rectal cancer suggesting the potential use of PV1 in these cancers. In summary, PV1 could be a good vaccine candidate for the treatment of HNSCC patients and other cancers expressing these antigens. ? 2018, ? 2018 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",FJX1; head and neck cancer; immunotherapy; MAGED4B; peptide vaccine,"cancer vaccine; dimer; dual antigenic peptide vaccine; four jointed box protein 1; gamma interferon; granzyme B; HLA A2 antigen; influenza virus matrix protein 1; melanoma antigen 4; messenger RNA; monoclonal antibody; peptide vaccine; tumor antigen; unclassified drug; virus nucleoprotein; cytokine; HLA A2 antigen; subunit vaccine; tumor antigen; adult; aged; antigen expression; antigen specificity; Article; breast cancer; cancer staging; CD8+ T lymphocyte; clinical article; colon cancer; controlled study; cytotoxic T lymphocyte; cytotoxicity; dendritic cell; drug efficacy; enzyme linked immunospot assay; female; flow cytometry; gene expression; head and neck cancer; human; human cell; immune response; immunogenicity; immunohistochemistry; lung cancer; male; mouth squamous cell carcinoma; nasopharynx carcinoma; overall survival; polymerase chain reaction; prostate cancer; protein expression; rectum cancer; T lymphocyte activation; Western blotting; head and neck tumor; immunology; lymphocyte activation; middle aged; mononuclear cell; tumor cell line; Adult; Aged; Antigens, Neoplasm; Cancer Vaccines; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytokines; Female; Gene Expression; Head and Neck Neoplasms; HLA-A2 Antigen; Humans; Leukocytes, Mononuclear; Lymphocyte Activation; Male; Middle Aged; T-Lymphocytes, Cytotoxic; Vaccines, Subunit",2-s2.0-85054921629

Even in mega doses that are often mostly and safely administered as intravenous infusions, the vitamin, as such or in its potent transportable form dehydroascorbic acid, does not affect healthy cells and targets only cancerous cells. The review proposes the need for clinicians in mainstream medicine to explore more intimately vitamin C's integrative use in treating many modern-day health problems, such as non-hormone dependent cancers, diabetes, Alzheimer's disease and sepsis, based on a proper appreciation of the strengths and limitations of both RCTs (efficacy studies) and observational studies (effectiveness studies). Vitamin C is a first line antioxidant. Its known pro-oxidant effects in killing cancer cells, along with its ubiquitous roles as an enzyme cofactor, offer much potential to be tapped in cancer therapy, either alone or in combination with other therapies. An adequate intake of dietary and supplemental vitamin C (90-120mg/day), is seen as a pivotal need for both young and old to ward off a plethora of health problems. ? 2019 Akademi Sains Malaysia.",Essential dietary supplement; Essential enzyme cofactor; First line antioxidant; Immune system booster; IV-Vitamin C; L-ascorbic acid; Vitamin C treatment in human disease,,2-s2.0-85072180615

However, the causal nature of the risk factors reported, and thus their suitability as effective intervention targets, is unclear given the susceptibility of conventional observational designs to residual confounding and reverse causation. Mendelian randomization (MR) uses genetic variants as proxies for risk factors to strengthen causal inference in observational studies. We used MR to evaluate the association of 12 previously reported risk factors (reproductive, anthropometric, clinical, lifestyle, and molecular factors) with risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer, invasive epithelial ovarian cancer histotypes, and low malignant potential tumours. Methods and findings: Genetic instruments to proxy 12 risk factors were constructed by identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that were robustly (P &lt; 5 × 10-8) and independently associated with each respective risk factor in previously reported genome-wide association studies. These risk factors included genetic liability to 3 factors (endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, type 2 diabetes) scaled to reflect a 50% higher odds liability to disease. We obtained summary statistics for the association of these SNPs with risk of overall and histotype-specific invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (22,406 cases; 40,941 controls) and low malignant potential tumours (3,103 cases; 40,941 controls) from the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC). The OCAC dataset comprises 63 genotyping project/case-control sets with participants of European ancestry recruited from 14 countries (US, Australia, Belarus, Germany, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Canada, Poland, UK, Spain, Netherlands, and Sweden). SNPs were combined into multi-allelic inverse-variance-weighted fixed or random effects models to generate effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Three complementary sensitivity analyses were performed to examine violations of MR assumptions: MR-Egger regression and weighted median and mode estimators. A Bonferroni- corrected P value threshold was used to establish strong evidence (P &lt; 0.0042) and suggestive evidence (0.0042 &lt; P &lt; 0.05) for associations. In MR analyses, there was strong or suggestive evidence that 2 of the 12 risk factors were associated with invasive epithelial ovarian cancer and 8 of the 12 were associated with 1 or more invasive epithelial ovarian cancer histotypes. There was strong evidence that genetic liability to endometriosis was associated with an increased risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR] per 50% higher odds liability: 1.10, 95% CI 1.06-1.15; P = 6.94 × 10-7) and suggestive evidence that lifetime smoking exposure was associated with an increased risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer (OR per unit increase in smoking score: 1.36, 95% CI 1.04-1.78; P = 0.02). In analyses examining histotypes and low malignant potential tumours, the strongest associations found were between height and clear cell carcinoma (OR per SD increase: 1.36, 95% CI 1.15-1.61; P = 0.0003); age at natural menopause and endometrioid carcinoma (OR per year later onset: 1.09, 95% CI 1.02-1.16; P = 0.007); and genetic liability to polycystic ovary syndrome and endometrioid carcinoma (OR per 50% higher odds liability: 0.89, 95% CI 0.82-0.96; P = 0.002). There was little evidence for an association of genetic liability to type 2 diabetes, parity, or circulating levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and sex hormone binding globulin with ovarian cancer or its subtypes. The primary limitations of this analysis include the modest statistical power for analyses of risk factors in relation to some less common ovarian cancer histotypes (low grade serous, mucinous, and clear cell carcinomas), the inability to directly examine the association of some ovarian cancer risk factors that did not have robust genetic variants available to serve as proxies (e.g., oral contraceptive use, hormone replacement therapy), and the assumption of linear relationships between risk factors and ovarian cancer risk. Conclusions: Our comprehensive examination of possible aetiological drivers of ovarian carcinogenesis using germline genetic variants to proxy risk factors supports a role for few of these factors in invasive epithelial ovarian cancer overall and suggests distinct aetiologies across histotypes. The identification of novel risk factors remains an important priority for the prevention of epithelial ovarian cancer.

Contrarily, PLWHA encounter social discrimination and adverse realities while finding it difficult to continue in their jobs. These complex phenomena interact to push them into a low economic status. A microfinance program can hopefully assist poor patients to cope with the negative economic consequences of this disease. But the conventional market-oriented microfinance institutions show reluctance to serve this group of people due to the possibilities of having credit risk. In this paper, we propose an alternative microfinancing technique that can provide a better economic life of the PLWHA while absorbing the credit risks. A comprehensive model is designed using specific Islamic financial instruments in conjugation with household economic portfolio theory. Critical realism method was adopted to construct this model. We concluded that the application of Islamic microfinance can enhance income of HIV patients while reducing the productivity-loss.

These help to reduce variations as well as the mortality and morbidity rates, which indicates the critical need for standardized care and adherence to evidence-based practices for patients hospitalized with ACS. The care pathways translate research and guidelines into clinical practice to close the gap between the guidelines and the clinical practices. Objectives: This review focuses on identifying the indicators used to evaluate ACS care pathways and their effect on the care process and clinical outcomes. Methods: This review follows the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The systematic research was conducted using five research databases. Two groups were created by dividing the studies according to their year of publication. The first group included those studies published from 1997 to 2007 (“Group 1”), while the second included those published from 2008 to 2018 (“Group 2”). Selected studies were screened using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) quality assessment tool. Results: Seventeen studies were included in this review. One study was a randomized controlled trial, 14 were predesigns and postdesigns, and two were longitudinal observational designs. The Group 1 studies demonstrated that ACS care pathways had a positive effect on reducing the length of the hospital stay and the door-to-balloon times. Similar effects were observed for the Group 2 studies. Conclusion: Implementing ACS care pathway helps to organize care processes and decrease treatment delays as well as improve the patient outcomes without adverse consequences for patients or additional resources and costs. While the current level of evidence is inadequate to warrant a formal recommendation, there is a need for more studies with an emphasis on well-designed randomization to measure patient outcomes. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",acute coronary syndrome; care pathways; clinical guidelines; guideline adherence; health care; systematic review,,2-s2.0-85071855054

We present a 25-year audit of HSCT for IEI at a tertiary-level academic hospital in Malaysia. Methods: Review of medical records of all cases of IEI who underwent HSCT between January 1993 and December 2018 at our centre. Diagnoses, complications, HSCT protocols and outcome data were studied. Results: There were 20 patients (19 boys) with a median age at diagnosis of 11 months (range: 2 months to 12 years). Eleven of 19 (58%) had malnutrition at presentation. Donor sources were variable: 13 (65%) matched sibling donor (MSD), 4 (20%) human leukocyte antigen-haploidentical donor (HD) and 3 (15%) matched unrelated donor (MUD). Conditioning regimens were physician-dependent and adapted to each patient's clinical status. Grades III–IV acute graft-versus-host disease occurred in two of three cases who received MUD grafts, 50% in those who received HD, and 8% in the MSD group. Transplant-related mortality at day +100 was 5%. With a median follow-up of 7.5 years, 18 (90%) patients are alive and free of infections. Conclusion: Outcome of HSCT for IEI in our centre is comparable with international reports. HSCT results using HD and MUD grafts are also good despite challenges from acute graft-versus-host disease, providing a feasible alternative for patients without matched donors. ? 2019 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians)",haematopoietic stem cell transplantation; immunity; immunologic deficiency syndrome; inborn genetic disease,,2-s2.0-85071758902

There is compiling evidence that corroborates the therapeutic effects of this plant extract as an efficacious concoction. Recently, the potential for the plant extract to be used for the regulation of fat metabolism has also been proposed. Results from in vivo and human trials were unable to determine if a decrease in lipid deposits was caused by E. longifolia root extract or that it was merely a side effect of the reported physiological changes. Therefore, this study adopted an in vitro model to investigate whether E. longifolia root extract possesses lipid lowering and/or absorption inhibitory potentials. The human hepatic cell line WRL-68 (normal and fat fed) was treated with various concentrations (1, 2, 4 and 8 ?g/ml) of E. longifolia root extract. The results showed reductions in intracellular fatty acids build-up of up to ~72%, in treated cells when compared to untreated control cells. However, treatments with E. longifolia did not show any significant inhibition of fatty acids absorption when compared to the respective control cells. This study, therefore, unraveled a novel potential of intracellular lipid lowering effect of E. longifolia. The findings warrant further studies to elucidate the intracellular signaling mechanisms that may explain the phenomenon. ? 2019 University of Kuwait.

The breast cancer is viewed as the second most common type of cancer and it is a big threat to women health and survival. Accurate prediction is a challenging problem with a significant experimental interest. One of the popular methods to predict breast cancer is using the bio-inspired computing. Bio-inspired computing approaches are global optimization algorithms motivated by the natural behaviors of swarms such as ants, birds, fishes and bees. Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) is a well-known bio-inspired algorithm, which is robust, easy to implement and has few setting parameters. However, one of ABC disadvantages is that of slow convergence due to poor exploration and exploitation processes. In this paper, a hybrid search strategy namely: Global Guided Artificial Bee Colony (GGABC) algorithm proposed for Recurrent Neural Network training. The proposed GGABC employs a new hybrid population based on a metaheuristic approach to circumvent the deficiency of the standard ABC. The GGABC algorithm was applied to predict the patient’s status of breast cancer. The approach was simulated by the foraging behavior of global best and guided honey bees. The simulation comparative analysis suggested that the GGABC algorithm was found to converge to the optimal solution faster than the ABC, Guided ABC and Global ABC with an improved accuracy. The results of this research can provide critical information to health authorities to effectively manage the risk factors of the breast cancer in an early stage. ?

Simulation comparative results indicated that the classification accuracy and run time of the CSLM outperform the CSERN, GANN, ABCBP, ABCLM, and CSBP in the breast tissue dataset. On the other hand, the CSERN performs better than the CSLM, GANN, ABCBP, ABCLM, and CSBP in both the dermatology and hepatitis datasets.

Arrhythmia is a sign of heart diseases that entails abnormal heart rhythm and is detected mostly by electrocardiogram (ECG) devices, which are attached to the chest, arms or legs of an individual. This mostly requires contact with the skin, which has to be routinely examined. Unfortunately, in unexpected, extreme situations of rising symptoms related to heart problems, the time it takes to examine a situation with the ECG signal device might make the difference between life and death. Non-contact ECG signal detection techniques could help assess cases of heart problems or an initial apoplectic condition without attaching ECG signal devices to people’s body. This paper aims to provide a non-contact ECG signal detection framework that could empower Malaysian community to get an access to understanding arrhythmic phase status at any time of their activities. The framework relies on one of the major activities that humans often engage in, which is sitting.

We present an Artificial Intelligence driven model in predicting Aedes outbreak, using predictors of weather variables and vector indices sourced from the Ministry of Health. Analysis and predictions to estimate Aedes populations were conducted, with its results being used to infer the possibility of dengue outbreaks at pre-determined localities around the Klang Valley, Malaysia. A Bayesian Network machine learning technique was employed, with the model being trained using predictor variables such as temperature, rainfall, date of onset and notification, and vector indices such as the Ae. albopictus count, Ae. aegypti count and larval count. The interfaces of the system were developed using the C# language for Server-side configuration and programming, and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for the Client Side programming. The model was then used to predict the population of Aedes at periods of 7, 14, and 30 days. Using the Bayesian Network technique utilising the above predictor variables we proposed a finalised model with predictive accuracy ranging from 79%-84%. This model was developed into a Graphical User Interface, which was purposed to assist and educate the general public of regions at risk of developing dengue outbreak. This remains a valuable case-study on the importance of public data in the context of combating a public health risk via the development of models for predicting outbreaks of dengue which will hopefully spur further sharing of data by all parties in combating public health threats. ? 2019, Malaysian Public Health Physicians Association.",Aedes; Aegypti; Albopictus; Bayesian Network; C#; Dengue; Predictive Model,,2-s2.0-85071395032

The aim of this study was to determine the viability and paracrine factor profile of stem cells from human extracted deciduous teeth (SHED) pre-cultivated in media supplemented with either foetal bovine serum (FBS) or pooled human serum (pHS) in the presence of individual human sera (iHS). Methods: SHED (n=3) from passage 4 were expanded in FBS (FBS-SHED) or pHS (pHS-SHED) supplemented media until passage 7. During expansion, the proliferation of SHED was determined. Cells at passage 7 were further expanded in human serum from four individual donors (iHS) for 120h followed by assessment of cell viability and profiling of the secreted paracrine factors. Results: Proliferation of SHED was significantly higher in pHS supplemented media compared to FBS supplemented media. pHS-SHED also maintained their higher proliferation rate compared to FBS-SHED in the presence of iHS. In iHS supplemented media, FBS-SHED expressed significantly higher levels of SDF-1A after h compared to pHS-SHED. Similar results were found for HGF PDGF-BB (p&lt;0.05), SDF-1A (p&lt;0.01), and IL-10 (p&lt;0.05) when cell culture supernatants from FBS-SHED were profiled 120h post-incubation. Conclusion: SHED expanded in pHS instead of FBS have higher proliferative capacity and show an altered secretion profile. Further studies are needed to determine whether these differences could result in better engraftment and regeneration following transplantation. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Mesenchymal stem cells; Paracrine factors; Proliferation; Regenerative medicine; SDF-1,"cell culture; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; culture medium; cytology; deciduous tooth; drug effect; female; human; mesenchymal stem cell; metabolism; paracrine signaling; pharmacology; serum; stem cell; Cell Differentiation; Cell Proliferation; Cells, Cultured; Culture Media; Female; Humans; Mesenchymal Stem Cells; Paracrine Communication; Serum; Stem Cells; Tooth, Deciduous",2-s2.0-85071281320

We additionally found positive associations for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC): HR = 1.16 (1.07–1.26) (SBP), HR = 1.31 (1.13–1.51) (DBP), weaker for head and neck cancers: HR = 1.08 (1.04–1.12) (SBP), HR = 1.09 (1.01–1.17) (DBP) and, similarly, for skin SCC, colon cancer, postmenopausal breast cancer and uterine adenocarcinoma (AC), but not for esophageal AC, lung SCC, lung AC or uterine endometroid cancer. We observed weak inverse associations of SBP with cervical SCC: HR = 0.91 (0.82–1.00) and lymphomas: HR = 0.97 (0.93–1.00). There were no consistent associations with cancers in other locations.

The antiviral activity was further investigated in an in vivo AG129 mouse model for dengue inhibitory candidates. 100 mg/kg EL extract was fed twice daily and challenged with a lethal dose of (~1x105 PFU per mouse) of DENV-2 over a period of six days. Antiviral activity with IC50 of 33.84, 33.55, 58.35 and 119 ?g/ml for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4 serotypes respectively was observed.

The DFE was shown to be locally asymptotically stable when the basic reproduction number, R0 is less than unity (R0 &lt; 1). The global stability of both the DFE and EEP were established with the aid of constructed Lyapunov functions. We proved that the model undergoes backward bifurcation, which gives direction to the medical experts that keeping the basic reproduction number less than unity (R0 &lt; 1) is not enough to curtail the spread of the infection but rather think of other measures. The numerical simulation done gives a pictorial representation of the impact of quarantine in managing MDR-TB as it helps in reducing the disease incidence. ? 2019, Badih/Ghusayni, Ed. & Pub.",Global stability; Lyapunov function; Multidrug-Resistant TB (MDR-TB); Quarantine,,2-s2.0-85071195484

Thus, this study aims to investigate the presence of Rickettsia sp. in the DNA of tick’s samples collected from small mammals in three different recreational forests in Selangor, Malaysia. Sampling was conducted in which 200 cage traps were set up randomly along streams and forest trails for five nights.

All samples were tested for Rickettsia bacteria based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using partial 17-kDa antigen gene. The PCR results obtained from this study showed no infestation of Rickettsia sp. in all tick samples. Our findings revealed that none of the tick samples from these forests’ sites were infected with Rickettsia pathogen, however, more intense and extensive surveillance for Rickettsia sp. from other tick species is still necessary for greater geographical areas across Malaysia. ? 2019, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Press.

However, the accessibility of healthcare services to migrant workers is questionable. Recently, medical fees for foreigners at public facilities were substantially increased. Mandatory health insurance only covers public hospital admissions and excludes undocumented migrants. This study explores barriers to healthcare access faced by documented and undocumented migrant workers in Malaysia. Methods We use qualitative data from 17 in-depth interviews conducted with key informants from civil society organisations, trade unions, academia, medical professionals, as well as migrant workers and their representatives. We interviewed doctors working in public hospitals and private clinics frequented by migrants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Results We found that healthcare services in Malaysia are often inaccessible to migrant workers. Complex access barriers were identified, many beyond the control of the health sector. Major themes include affordability and financial constraints, the need for legal documents like valid passports and work permits, language barriers, discrimination and xenophobia, physical inaccessibility and employer-related barriers. Our study suggests that government mandated insurance for migrant workers is insufficient in view of the recent increase in medical fees. The perceived close working relationship between the ministries of health and immigration effectively excludes undocumented migrants from access to public healthcare facilities. Language barriers may affect the quality of care received by migrant workers, by inadvertently resulting in medical errors, while preventing them from giving truly informed consent. Conclusions We propose instituting migrant-friendly health services at public facilities.

Health care personal especially nurses play an important role in educating public to have healthy lifestyle. However, there is an alarming rate of increase in number of obesity among nursing students as well as staff nurses. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the anthropometric measurements and its associated risks among post-basic renal care nursing students. Total of 142 post-basic renal care nursing students of five intakes were included in this cross-sectional study. The result of the study showed that 52% of participants were either overweight or obese although most of them were below 40 years of age. Majority of overweight or obese students were Malays and 78% of them being female. We also observed an association of systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and waist circumference (WC)with increasing body mass index (BMI) (P= 0.001, P= 0.001 and P < 0.001) which were statistically significant. Wald criterion estimated that WC and DBP were the most important predictors of BMI in present study. Our study concluded that obesity is prevalent among post-basic renal care nursing students. Urgent and appropriate action should be taken to deter the growing problem of obesity among nursing students and to avoid its subsequent complications in Malaysia. ? 2019, Malaysian Public Health Physicians Association.",Blood pressure; BMI; Lifestyle; Obesity; Waist circumference,,2-s2.0-85069046780

However, associations between the prevalence of various HBV genotypes and the extent of liver damage have been reported from different parts of the world. The purpose of this study was to determine the distribution of HBV genotypes in patients with chronic HBV infection in Bangladesh, a country of 160 million people, of which approximately 3–6 million are chronically infected HBV patients. In addition, whole and partial genome sequencing of HBV was performed to evaluate the relationship between HBV mutations and genotypes. We found that 42% of the patients with low HBV DNA and normal levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) had HBV genotype D. In contrast, the HBV genotype C was dominant among patients with high HBV DNA levels (>2000 IU/ ml) and elevated ALT and in patients with liver cirrhosis (LC) and hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). Whole and partial genome sequences of HBV revealed that most patients with LC and HCC had HBV genotype C with mutations at the T1762/A1764 positions. It seems that Bangladesh represents a borderline country, situated within East Asia, which mainly consists of individuals with HBV genotypes B and C, whereas in the western parts of Asia, HBV genotypes A and D are prevalent. Bangladesh is, therefore, an excellent model for the comparison of the pathophysiology of three major HBV genotypes in a single population. The findings of this study suggest a possible association between HBV viral factors and the extent of liver damage in chronic HBV-infected patients. ? 2019 Raihan et al.

Although the mechanisms of action of Dis against several cancer cell lines are well reported, in vivo anti-tumorigenesis properties of this compound are still obscure. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the anti-tumorigenesis properties of Dis against HCT-116 colon cancer xenografts in nude mice. HCT-116 colon cancer cells were injected in NCr nu/nu nude mice and treatment with Dis was initiated after the tumor volumes reached 100 mm3 and continued for four weeks. On the sacrificing date nude mice treated with 100 mg/kg of Dis showed significant lower tumor volume (264 ± 238.3 mm3) as compared to the untreated group (1428.8 ± 459.6 mm3). Anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 protein was significantly downregulated, while apoptotic protein (Bax) was significantly overexpressed in nude mice treated with 100 mg/kg Dis as compared to untreated mice. In conclusion, our in vivo results indicate that Dis significantly reduces tumor growth rate of HCT-116 colon cancer cells in nude mice at a dose of 100 mg/kg, and has no toxic effects in ICR mice up to 2000 mg/kg. ? 2019 by the authors.",Anti-tumorigenesis; Apoptosis; Colon cancer; Diosmetin; Nude mice,"analgesic agent; diosmetin; flavonoid; animal; apoptosis; colon tumor; disease model; drug effect; drug screening; female; HCT 116 cell line; human; mouse; nude mouse; pathology; toxicity testing; tumor cell line; tumor volume; Analgesics; Animals; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Colonic Neoplasms; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Flavonoids; HCT116 Cells; Humans; Mice; Mice, Nude; Toxicity Tests, Acute; Tumor Burden; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-85068932211

Therefore, this study aims to assess the effect of co-administration of zerumbone (ZER) and ZERencapsulated in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin with TP5-iRGD peptide towards cell cytotoxicity, apoptosis induction, and proliferation of normal and cancerous breast cells utilizing in vitro assays, as well as to study the molecular docking of ZER in complex with TP5-iRGD peptide. Cell viability assay findings indicated that ZER and ZERencapsulated in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (ZER-HPβCD) inhibited the growth of estrogen receptor positivebreast cancer cells (ER+ MCF-7) at 72 h treatment with an inhibitory concentration (IC)50 of 7.51 ± 0.2 and 5.08 ± 0.2 ?g/mL, respectively, and inhibited the growth of triple negative breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231) with an IC50 of 14.96 ± 1.52 ?g/mL and 12.18 ± 0.7 ?g/mL, respectively. On the other hand, TP5-iRGD peptide showed no significant cytotoxicity on both cancer and normal cells. Interestingly, co-administration of TP5-iRGD peptide in MCF-7 cells reduced the IC50 of ZER from 7.51 ± 0.2 ?g/mL to 3.13 ± 0.7 ?g/mL and reduced the IC50 of ZER-HPβCD from 5.08 ± 0.2 ?g/mL to 0.49 ± 0.004 ?g/mL, indicating that the co-administration enhances the potency and increases the efficacy of ZER and ZER-HPβCD compounds. Acridine orange (AO)/propidium iodide (PI) staining under fluorescence microscopy showed evidence of early apoptosis after 72 h from the co-administration of ZER or ZER-HPβCD with TP5-iRGD peptide in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. The findings of the computational modelling experiment provide novel insights into the ZER interaction with integrin αvβ3 in the presence of TP5-iRGD, and this could explain why ZER has better antitumor activities when co-administered with TP5-iRGD peptide. ? 2019 by the authors",Breast cancer; Integrin; TP5-iRGD peptide; Zerumbone,"antineoplastic agent; N-end cysteine peptide tumor-homing peptide; oligopeptide; sesquiterpene; vitronectin receptor; zerumbone; apoptosis; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; conformation; dose response; drug effect; female; human; metabolism; molecular model; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Humans; Integrin alphaVbeta3; Models, Molecular; Molecular Conformation; Oligopeptides; Sesquiterpenes",2-s2.0-85068894929

Demand and cost of initial hospitalization has also increased. This study assessed the cost of preterm birth during initial hospitalization from care provider perspective in neonatal intensive care units (NICU) of two hospitals in the state of Kedah, Malaysia. It utilized universal sampling and prospectively followed up preterm infants till discharge. Care provider cost was assessed using mixed method of top down approach and activity based costing. A total of 112 preterm infants were recruited from intensive care (93 infants) and minimal care (19 infants) units. Majority were from the moderate (23%) and late (36%) preterm groups followed by very preterm (32%) and extreme preterm (9%). Median cost per infant increased with level of care and degree of prematurity. Cost was dominated by overhead (fixed) costs for general (hospital), intermediate (clinical support services) and final (NICU) cost centers where it constituted at least three quarters of admission cost per infant while the remainder was consumables (variable) cost. Breakdown of overhead cost showed NICU specific overhead contributing at least two thirds of admission cost per infant. Personnel salary made up three quarters of NICU specific overhead. Laboratory investigation was the cost driver for consumables. Gender, birth weight and length of stay were significant factors and cost prediction was developed with these variables. This study demonstrated the inverse relation between resource utilization, cost and prematurity and identified personnel salary as the cost driver. Cost estimates and prediction provide in-depth understanding of provider cost and are applicable for further economic evaluations. Since gender is non-modifiable and reducing LOS alone is not effective, birth weight as a cost predictive factor in this study can be addressed through measures to prevent or delay preterm birth. ? 2019 Zainal et al.

The current knowledge on the molecular pathogenesis of NPC is still inadequate to improve disease management. Using gene expression microarrays, we have identified the four-jointed box 1 (FJX1) gene to be upregulated in primary NPC tissues relative to nonmalignant tissues. An orthologue of human FJX1, the four-jointed (fj) gene in Drosophila and Fjx1 in mouse, has reported to be associated with cancer progression pathways. However, the exact function of FJX1 in human is not well characterized. The overexpression of FJX1 mRNA was validated in primary NPC tissue samples, and the level of FJX1 protein was significantly higher in a subset of NPC tissues (42%) compared to the normal epithelium, where no expression of FJX1 was observed (p = 0 01). FJX1 is also found to be overexpressed in microarray datasets and TCGA datasets of other cancers including head and neck cancer, colorectal, and ovarian cancer. Both siRNA knockdown and overexpression experiments in NPC cell lines showed that FJX1 promotes cell proliferation, anchorage-dependent growth, and cellular invasion. Cyclin D1 and E1 mRNA levels were increased following FJX1 expression indicating that FJX1 enhances proliferation by regulating key proteins governing the cell cycle. Our data suggest that the overexpression of FJX1 contributes to a more aggressive phenotype of NPC cells and further investigations into FJX1 as a potential therapeutic target for NPC are warranted. The evaluation of FJX1 as an immunotherapy target for NPC and other cancers is currently ongoing. ? 2019 San Jiun Chai et al.",,"cyclin D1; cyclin e1; cycline; four jointed box 1 protein; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; oncoprotein; protein; small interfering RNA; tumor marker; unclassified drug; cycline; FJX1 protein, human; membrane protein; tumor marker; anchorage independent growth; Article; cancer growth; cancer tissue; carcinogenesis; cell cycle regulation; cell invasion; cell proliferation; colorectal cancer; controlled study; disease association; DNA microarray; epithelium; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; gene knockdown; gene overexpression; head and neck cancer; HeLa cell line; hela t cell line; human; human cell; human tissue; mRNA expression level; nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line; nasopharynx carcinoma; NPC/HK1 cell line; ovary cancer; phenotype; protein expression level; protein function; upregulation; carcinoma; epithelium cell; genetics; metabolism; nasopharynx tumor; pathology; physiology; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma; Cell Proliferation; Cyclins; Epithelial Cells; HeLa Cells; Humans; Membrane Proteins; Nasopharyngeal Neoplasms; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85068765644

This study aimed to examine the level of perceived stigma and its associated factors in MDD patients in five Asian countries, including China, Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand. A total of 547 outpatients with MDD were included from Asian countries. We used the stigma scale of the Explanatory Model Interview Catalogue (EMIC) to assess stigma. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Symptoms Checklist 90-Revised (SCL-90-R), Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS), 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) were used to assess symptoms, clinical features, functional impairment, health status, and social support. The stigma scores of patients under 55 years old were significantly higher than those equal to or greater than 55 years old (P < 0.001). The stigma scores exhibited significant negative correlation with age; MSPSS scores of family, friends, and others; and SF-36 subscale of mental health, but significant positive correlation with MADRS, FSS, SDS, and SCL-90-R subscale scores of depression, interpersonal sensitivity, obsession-compulsion, psychoticism, and somatization. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that age, SCL-90-R interpersonal sensitivity, obsession-compulsion, psychoticism, MSPSS scores of friends and others, and SF-36 of mental health were significantly associated with the level of perceived stigma. These findings suggest that MDD patients who are young, have a high degree of interpersonal sensitivity and psychoticism, have low health-related quality of life, and have low social support are the target population for stigma interventions in Asia. ? 2019 Sun, Chen, Wang, Li, Srisurapanont, Hong, Hatim, Chen, Udomratn, Bae, Fang, Chua, Liu, George, Bautista, Chan, Rush, Yang, Su and Si.

DENV is a global public health problem with significant social and economic impacts, especially in tropical and subtropical areas. JEV is a neurotropic arbovirus endemic to east and southeast Asia. There are no U.S. FDA-approved antiviral drugs available to treat or to prevent DENV and JEV infections, leaving nearly one-third of the world’s population at risk for infection. Therefore, it is crucial to discover potent antiviral agents against these viruses. Nucleoside analogs, as a class, are widely used for the treatment of viral infections. In this study, we discovered nucleoside analogs that possess potent and selective anti-JEV and anti-DENV activities across all serotypes in cell-based assay systems. Both viruses were susceptible to sugar-substituted 2=-C-methyl analogs with either cytosine or 7-deaza-7-fluoro-adenine nucleobases. Mouse studies confirmed the anti-DENV activity of these nucleoside analogs. Molecular models were assembled for DENV serotype 2 (DENV-2) and JEV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase replication complexes bound to nucleotide inhibitors. These models show similarities between JEV and DENV-2, which recognize the same nucleotide inhibitors.

Results from large datasets that examined falls risk factors in Asia have been limited. The aim of the present study was to identify the risk factors for falls by pooling data consisting of medical history, physical performance and self-rated health from two large Malaysian epidemiological studies. Methods: Matching variables from the Towards Useful Aging and Malaysian Elders Longitudinal Research datasets related to falls, physical performance and determinants of falls were identified and pooled for analysis. The Timed Up and Go test and dominant handgrip strength tests were used as physical performance measures. Falls were self-reported, and functional status was assessed using activities of daily living. Results: Data of 3935 participants, mean age 68.9 ± 6.8 years, 2127 (54.0%) women and 1807 (46.0%) men were extracted for analyses. In an adjusted model, independent risk factors for falls from this cohort studies were diabetes (OR 1.258), arthritis (OR 1.366), urinary incontinence (OR 1.346), poor self-rated health (OR 1.293), higher body mass index (OR 1.029) and lower handgrip strength (OR 1.234). Conclusions: Although the risk factors that emerged from our analyses were similar to available studies among older adults, the Timed Up and Go test did not appear as one of the risk factors in the present study that included middle-aged adults. Our findings will require confirmation in a prospective study.

Despite its chemical instability due to auto-oxidation, exogenous supplementation of BH4 can reverse this dysfunction. Thus, a sensitive and simple liquid chromatographic-mass spectrometric (LC-MS) method was developed and validated for the measurement of BH4 in plasma after its oral or intravenous administration in apolipoprotein E (ApoE) knockout mice. Human plasma samples were prepared from protein precipitation, and chromatographic separation was performed on a C18 column with methanol-water mobile phases and a run time of 7 minutes with ion detection at m/z 242. The limit of quantitation was 10 ng/mL and inaccuracy and imprecision were ?15%. In the presence of antioxidant dithioerythritol, recovery of BH4 was 80% and stable for 24 h post sample collection. Following oral or intravenous administration of BH4 in ApoE mice, the maximum concentrations detected were 102 and 483 ng/mL, respectively. Area under the curve values for oral BH4 were three time lower than those of intravenous BH4. The half-life of BH4 was 1.6 h, and it demonstrated low oral bioavailability (15%). Results of this study provide the basis for further studies of future clinical applications of BH4. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",ApoE mice; LC-MS; Method Development; Pharmacokinetics; Tetrahydrobiopterin,Biochemistry; Coenzymes; Lipoproteins; Liquid chromatography; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Pharmacokinetics; Precipitation (chemical); ApoE mice; Apolipoprotein E (apoE); Chromatographic separations; Endothelial dysfunction; Intravenous administration; LC-MS; Method development; Tetrahydrobiopterin; Mammals; apolipoprotein E; dithioerythritol; tetrahydrobiopterin; animal experiment; area under the curve; Article; chromatography; drug absorption; drug bioavailability; elimination rate constant; environmental temperature; limit of quantitation; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; maximum concentration; mouse; nonhuman; pharmacokinetic parameters; precipitation; time to maximum plasma concentration,2-s2.0-85067890065

Methods: Six key sections were chosen: (1) high-risk localized and locally advanced prostate cancer, (2) oligometastatic prostate cancer, (3) castration-na?ve prostate cancer, (4) castrate resistant prostate cancer, (5) use of osteoclast-targeted therapy and (6) global access to prostate cancer drugs. There were 101 consensus questions, consisting of 91 questions from APCCC 2017 and 10 new questions from MyAPCCC 2018, selected and modified by the steering committee; of which, 23 questions were assessed in both ideal world and real-world settings. A panel of 22 experts, comprising of 11 urologists and 11 oncologists, voted on 101 predefined questions anonymously. Final voting results were compared with?the APCCC 2017 outcomes. Results: Most voting results from the MyAPCCC 2018 were consistent with the APCCC 2017 outcomes. No consensus was achieved for controversial topics with little level I evidence, such as management of oligometastatic disease. No consensus was reached on using high-cost drugs in castration-na?ve or castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer in real-world settings. All panellists recommended using generic drugs when available. Conclusions: The MyAPCCC 2018 voting results reflect the management of advanced prostate cancer in a middle-income country in a real-world setting.

Model-driven development suggests 1) the realization of a complex system using a conceptual model; 2) its automatic transformation into an executable form using transformation rules, and; 3) its automatic verification using a formal analysis technique for an accurate assessment of its correctness. Both approaches have numerous complementary benefits in rapid prototyping of complex systems using model reuse. In this paper, we propose a framework grounded in a combination of component-based and model-driven approaches to promote rapid prototyping of complex systems through the effective reuse of the simulation models. Our proposed process allows developers to 1) build or select existing components and compose them to formulate the conceptual models of complex systems; 2) automatically transform the conceptual models for the rapid implementation and simulation, and; 3) automatically verify them as per the requirement specifications. We propose the use of the extended finite-state machine (EFSM) as conceptual modeling formalism, anylogic simulation platform for the implementation, and probabilistic model checking technique using communicating sequential process (CSP) formalism for the verification. Finally, we present a case study of a real-time adaptive cruise control system to demonstrate the functionality of our framework. Our proposed component-based model-driven approach facilitates rapid prototyping and effective meaningful reuse of complex system models, which further accelerates the modeling, simulation, and analysis process of real-time systems and aids in complex engineering designs and implementations. ? 2013 IEEE.",adaptive cruise control system; anylogic simulation; complex systems; Component-based development; model driven engineering; probabilistic model checking,Adaptive control systems; Adaptive cruise control; Computer aided software engineering; Computer control; Computer operating procedures; Interactive computer systems; Large scale systems; Rapid prototyping; Real time systems; Simulation platform; anylogic simulation; Automatic transformations; Communicating sequential process; Component based modeling and simulation; Component-Based Development; Extended finite state machine; Model-driven Engineering; Probabilistic model checking; Model checking,2-s2.0-85067231383

In view of the increasing internet access and mobile phone ownership, ScreenMen, a mobile Web app, was developed to improve health screening uptake in men. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the utility and usability of ScreenMen. Methods: This study used both qualitative and quantitative methods. Healthy men working in a banking institution were recruited to participate in this study. They were purposively sampled according to job position, age, education level, and screening status. Men were asked to use ScreenMen independently while the screen activities were being recorded. Once completed, retrospective think aloud with playback was conducted with men to obtain their feedback. They were asked to answer the System Usability Scale (SUS). Intention to undergo screening pre-and postintervention was also measured. Qualitative data were analyzed using a framework approach followed by thematic analysis. For quantitative data, the mean SUS score was calculated and change in intention to screening was analyzed using McNemar test. Results: In total, 24 men participated in this study. On the basis of the qualitative data, men found ScreenMen useful as they could learn more about their health risks and screening. They found ScreenMen convenient to use, which might trigger men to undergo screening. In terms of usability, men thought that ScreenMen was user-friendly and easy to understand. The key revision done on utility was the addition of a reminder function, whereas for usability, the revisions done were in terms of attracting and gaining users’ trust, improving learnability, and making ScreenMen usable to all types of users. To attract men to use it, ScreenMen was introduced to users in terms of improving health instead of going for screening. Another important revision made was emphasizing the screening tests the users do not need, instead of just informing them about the screening tests they need. A Quick Assessment Mode was also added for users with limited attention span. The quantitative data showed that 8 out of 23 men (35%) planned to attend screening earlier than intended after using the ScreenMen. Furthermore, 4 out of 12 (33%) men who were in the precontemplation stage changed to either contemplation or preparation stage after using ScreenMen with P=.13. In terms of usability, the mean SUS score of 76.4 (SD 7.72) indicated that ScreenMen had good usability. Conclusions: This study showed that ScreenMen was acceptable to men in terms of its utility and usability. The preliminary data suggested that ScreenMen might increase men’s intention to undergo screening. This paper also presented key lessons learned from the beta testing, which is useful for public health experts and researchers when developing a user-centered mobile Web app. ?

Treatment options include topical agents and phototherapy as well as nonbiologic and biologic systemic therapy. Mild psoriasis can often be managed with topical agents. However, managing moderate to severe psoriasis is more challenging and may require systemic treatment with nonbiologics or biologics. Despite the availability of several biologics, there are many unmet clinical needs, which may be addressed by secukinumab, an IL-17A inhibitor. This position statement is based on an expert panel discussion and is intended to provide dermatologists an overview of existing options as well as to provide a better understanding of secukinumab and how it can be integrated into current practice. During the discussion, panel members examined current approaches and the role of secukinumab in plaque psoriasis management. Panel members estimated that up to 30% of patients have moderate to severe psoriasis but only 1-2% receive biologics. Highlights from the discussion were that (i) the threshold for biologic use should be lower, in line with international guidelines; (ii) studies have shown that secukinumab has several advantages over other biologics which are greater efficacy, sustained efficacy over time, rapid onset of action, and early evidence of possible disease-modifying potential; and (iii) ideal candidates for secukinumab are all patients of moderate to severe psoriasis, including those with history of treatment failure, difficult-to-treat patterns of psoriasis (nail, scalp, and palmoplantar psoriasis), psoriatic arthritis, and comorbidities and those aiming for clear skin. Panel members recommend that secukinumab be considered first line option among biologic therapies. ? 2019 Asmah Johar et al.",,secukinumab; biological therapy; Dermatology Life Quality Index; disease severity; drug safety; human; Malaysia; nail psoriasis; patient monitoring; phototherapy; physician global assessment; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; psoriasis vulgaris; psoriatic arthritis; pustulosis palmoplantaris; Review; scalp psoriasis; scoring system; treatment failure; treatment response,2-s2.0-85066299771

This study aims to explore patients' views on the factors influencing implementation of an “insulin choice” PDA in a primary care setting. Methods: This study used a descriptive qualitative study design. Interviews were conducted using a semistructured interview guide developed based on the theoretical domains framework. Nine in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted with patients with type 2 diabetes who have been advised to start insulin or were currently using insulin and those who had been seeking diabetes treatment in the clinic for more than 1?year. Interviews were conducted after the participants were familiarized with the PDA. Data were analysed using a thematic approach. Results: Five themes emerged from the data analysis: (a) trust in the physician (patients preferred physicians to other health care providers in delivering the insulin PDA to them as they trusted physicians more when it comes to making decisions such as starting insulin), (b) physician's attitude (patients were more likely to trust a physician who is friendly and sympathetic hence would be more willing to use the insulin PDA), (c) physician's communication style (patients were more willing to use the insulin PDA if the physicians would take time and guide them in the PDA use), (d) conducive environment (patients preferred to read the PDA at home), and (e) cost (patients would not be willing to pay to use the insulin PDA unless they needed it). Conclusions: Patients want physicians to play a major role in the implementation of the insulin PDA; physicians' communication style and commitment may influence implementation outcomes. Health care authorities need to create a conducive environment and provide patients with free access to PDA to promote effective implementation. ? 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",barriers; decision support; facilitators; implementation; insulin initiation; patient decision aid; patients' perspectives; type 2 diabetes mellitus,,2-s2.0-85066120304

Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted at two primary care clinics in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, recruiting 271 participants by utilizing the universal sampling method. Every patient who attended both the clinics during the study period and met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were approached and briefed about the study. Patients who gave consent were recruited as study participants. Information on sociodemographic, medical condition, and lifestyle behaviors were obtained. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to screen for MCI at a score < 23. The World Health Organization Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to evaluate QOL. Results: Prevalence of MCI was 27.3%. Lower QOL scores were found in the physical (67.3?±?1.4), psychological (67.3?±?1.4), social (66.9?±?1.6) and environmental (71.3?±?1.3) domains among participants with MCI. Among them, predictors of QOL were depression in the physical domain, age and stroke in the psychological domain, presence of other types of disorders in the social domain and diabetes and stroke in the environmental domain. Conclusions: MCI was prevalent among study participants and were associated with poorer QOL in all domains of QOL. A better understanding of predictors of QOL in older people with MCI is deemed important. Clinical implication: Routine cognitive screening at primary care clinics will facilitate early recognition of MCI and facilitates referral to memory clinics for further assessment and treatment. ? 2019, ? 2019 Taylor & Francis.",Malaysia; Mild Cognitive Impairment; MoCA; Primary care clinics; quality of life; WHOQOL-BREF,,2-s2.0-85066106883

In this paper, a new methodology is introduced for future self-face image synthesis using age and weight, resulting in visualization of future face image derived from given weight category and age. A Constrained Local Model is first used for weight progressed future face image synthesized and then age-progressed future face image is generated using Conditional Adversarial Auto Encoder. In the final step, both weight progressed and age-progressed face images fed to face morphing module which synthesized future face image by keeping natural looks.

The most significant discoveries in hepatology have been that of hepatitis B virus in 1963 and hepatitis C virus in 1989, which have both been shown to be predominantly blood borne diseases. Hepatitis B and C infections result in long term carrier state and a high propensity to develop liver cirrhosis and cancer. Hepatitis B is the most common cause of liver cirrhosis and cancer in Malaysia. Blood bank screening and public health preventive measures have reduced the disease burden significantly and an effective vaccination for hepatitis B is now incorporated in our National Immunisation Programme. Although no vaccine is available for hepatitis C, highly effective eradication therapies were introduced in 2011. These agents will significantly change the disease scenario across the world. A “new” disease was described in 1980, by Ludwig et al.—non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD) disease. With the global epidemic of obesity and diabetes mellitus, NAFLD is set to increase exponentially across the world including in Malaysia.

However, there is no scientific data about effects of its higher doses on internal organs. Accordingly, this study aimed to evaluate the acute and subacute effects of higher doses of GTN on the hematology, biochemistry, and histology of selected internal organs of male Sprague-Dawley rats. In acute study, 35 rats were distributed in 5 groups (n=7) which were intraperitoneally (IP) injected with a single dose of either 100, 200, 300, 400, or 500 mg/kg of GTN, while extra 7 rats serve as a normal control. In subacute study, 7 rats were IP-injected with a daily dose of 42 mg/kg of GTN for 14 days, while another 7 rats serve as a normal control group. The normal controls in both studies were IP-injected simultaneously with 2 ml/kg of 10% DMSO in PBS. At the end of both tests, rats were sacrificed to collect blood for hematology and biochemistry and harvest livers, kidneys, lungs, hearts, spleens, and brains for histology. During acute and subacute exposure, no abnormal changes were observed in the hematology, biochemistry, and histology of the internal organs. However, the 300, 400, and 500 mg/kg of GTN during acute exposure were associated with morbidities and mortalities. Ultimately, GTN could be safe up to the dose of 200 mg/kg, and the dose of 42 mg/kg of GTN was tolerated well. ? 2019 Fahmi Kaid et al.",,goniothalamin; plant medicinal product; unclassified drug; acute toxicity; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; biochemical analysis; brain histology; controlled study; drug effect; drug exposure; drug safety; drug tolerability; Goniothalamus; heart; hematological parameters; histology; histopathology; kidney; liver histology; male; morbidity; mortality; nonhuman; rat; spleen; Sprague Dawley rat,2-s2.0-85065613438

There is considerable debate regarding both the outcomes of feminizing genitoplasty and timing of the surgery in this population. Objective: To investigate outcomes of females 46,XX individuals with CAH in Malaysia, the surgical outcomes of feminizing genitoplasty (FG) and their attitudes toward surgery. Study Design: This is a cross-sectional study involving the two main tertiary centers in Malaysia. All 46,XX patients with CAH and raised female, who had undergone FG were identified and invited to participate. Data on socio-demographic, medical profiles, and attitudes toward surgery were collected. A standardized evaluation of the external genitalia was undertaken including the anatomic and cosmetic evaluation by independent gynecologists. Results: Of 61 individuals identified, 59 participated-consisting of children (n = 12), adolescents (n = 29) and adults (n = 18). All but one had classical CAH (98.3%) and had undergone FG (n = 55, 93.2%) with surgery mostly undertaken by pediatric surgeons trained in DSD work (n = 44, 74.6%). Complications overall were low (20.3%), with repeat surgery rate of 9.1%. External genital examination was performed in 38 participants. Overall 36.8% had absent clitoral glands and 39.5% had a persistent urogenital sinus and in 10.5%, no vaginal orifices were seen. Poor cosmetic outcomes were present in 42.1% with 55.3% recommended for further assessment under general anesthetic. Almost half participants did not venture an opinion on FG, those who did varied from having a positive attitude toward it (18 participants) to 3 opining that it should not be done, or avoided or delayed. From the participants, 35.5% preferred FG to be done early in life compared to 44.0% of the parents. Conclusions: The reoperation rates of the feminizing genitoplasty surgeries were low however due to the anatomic and cosmetic outcomes, reassessment of the external genitalia of these CAH patients may be required once they consider becoming sexually active as they may require further treatment. Many factors such as cultural sensitivities and access to medical treatment and late diagnoses have an impact on attitudes toward FG. ? 2019 Zainuddin, Grover, Soon, Nur Azurah, Mahdy, Wu, Rasat, Harun, Chia and Shamsuddin.",Ambiguous genitalia; Atypical genitalia; Congenital adrenal hyperplasia; External genitalia; Feminizing surgery; Genitoplasty,anesthetic agent; cosmetic; adolescent; adult; Article; child; congenital adrenal hyperplasia; cross-sectional study; demography; excessive remaining labial skin; female; feminizing genitoplasty; general anesthesia; gynecologist; hematoma; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; Malaysian; patient attitude; pediatric surgeon; postoperative complication; scar formation; school child; small haematoma; urinary tract disease; urogenital sinus; urologic surgery; vaginal stenosis,2-s2.0-85065321953

Multiple faults in a program may reduce the effectiveness of the existing fault localization techniques due to the complex relationship between faults and failures in the presence of multiple faults. In an ideal case, faults are isolated into fault-focused clusters, each targeting a single fault for developers to localize them simultaneously in parallel. However, the relationship between faults and failures is not easily identified and depends solely on the accuracy of clustering, such as existing clustering algorithms are not able to isolate failed tests to their causative faults effectively which hinder localization effectiveness. This paper proposes a new approach that makes use of a divisive network community clustering algorithm to isolate faults into separate fault-focused communities that target a single fault each. A community weighting and a selection mechanism that aids in prioritizing highly important fault-focused communities to the available developers to debug the faults simultaneously in parallel is also proposed. The approach is evaluated on eight subject programs ranging from medium-sized to large-sized programs (tcas, replace, gzip, sed, flex, grep, make, and ant). Overall, 540 multiple-fault versions of these programs were generated with 2-5 faulty versions. The experimental results have demonstrated that the proposed approach performs significantly better in terms of localization effectiveness in comparison with two other parallel debugging approaches for locating multiple faults in parallel. ? 2013 IEEE.",Complex network; fault isolation; fault localization; multiple faults; parallel debugging; program debugging,Clustering algorithms; Complex networks; Software testing; Complex relationships; Fault isolation; Fault localization; Multiple faults; Network communities; Parallel debugging; Selection mechanism; Software program; Program debugging,2-s2.0-85065122409

STD are among the most widespread diseases in the world and have the highest prevalence in Sub-Saharan Africa. The current study explored the associations between the allocation of the development assistance for health (DAH) in 54 African countries and key development indicators-STD incidence, Gross Domestic Product per capita, health expenditure, and life expectancy at birth. It employed descriptive statistical methods, the matrix scatter plot analysis and the Pearson correlation test for this purpose. The findings indicated that there was a considerable increase in the volume of the DAH given to control and prevent STD in Africa over the period of 2002-2011. A statistically significant positive association was detected between the STD incidence and the health aid allocations. At the same time, the imbalance in the distribution of the health aid between the major and minor aid recipients in the continent increased. The study concludes by discussing policy implications that can be drawn from these findings. Copyright ?

In this paper, a hybrid of Generalized Adaptive Resonance Theory (GART) and interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (IT2FLS) algorithm is proposed, and named as Generalized Adaptive Resonance Theory and interval type-2 fuzzy logic system (GART-IT2FLS). The GART is a combination of adaptive resonance theory network (ART) and Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN). GART is capable to deal with classification task effectively. However, type-2 fuzzy sets (T2 FS) is used to represent and model the uncertainties on inputs. The performance evaluation of GART-IT2FLS algorithm in three medical datasets has proven that GART-IT2FLS is capable to learn incrementally without plasticity-stability dilemma, and model uncertainties in medical datasets. The inferences of GAR-IT2FLS in these applications are discussed. The performance results show that GART-IT2FLS has obtained a comparable number of rules.

Both electronic and manual searches were conducted. The main outcome of interest was the determinants of CHE due to healthcare payments. Thirty eight studies met the inclusion criteria for review. The analysis revealed that household economic status, incidence of hospitalisation, presence of an elderly or disabled household member in the family, and presence of a family member with a chronic illness were the common significant factors associated with household CHE. The crucial finding of the current study is that socioeconomic inequality plays an important role in the incidence of CHE all over the world, where low-income households are at high risk of financial hardship from healthcare payments. This suggests that healthcare financing policies should be revised in order to narrow the gap in socioeconomic inequality and social safety nets should be implemented and strengthened for people who have a high need for health care. ?

The aim of this study was to estimate the cost of CRC management from the perspective of the health care provider, based on standard operating procedures. Methods: A combination of top-down approach and activity-based costing was applied. The standard operating procedure (SOP) for CRC was developed for each stage according to national data and guidelines at the University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). The unit cost was calculated and incorporated into the treatment pathway in order to obtain the total cost of managing a single CRC patient according to the stage of illness. The cost data were represented by means and standard deviation and the results were demonstrated by tabulation. All cost data are presented in Malaysian Ringgit (RM). The cost difference between early stage (Stage I) and late stage (Stage II-IV) was analysed using independent t-test. Results: The cost per patient increased with stage of CRC, from RM13,672 (USD4,410.30) for stage I, to RM27,972 (USD9,023.20) for Stage IV. The early stage had statistically significant lower cost compared to late stage t(2) = -4.729, P = 0.042. The highest fraction of the cost was related to surgery for Stage I, but was superseded by oncology day care treatment for Stages II-IV. CRC is a costly illness. From a provider perspective, the highest cost was found in Stages III and IV. The early stages conserved more resources than did the advanced stages of cancer. Conclusion: Early diagnosis and management of CRC, therefore, not only affects oncologic prognosis, but has implications for health care costs. This adds further justification to develop and implement CRC screening programmes in Malaysia. ?

This study aims to estimate the prevalence of IPV among women attending urban primary care services in Malaysia and to identify the risk factors associated with IPV. Six out of 15 available public primary care clinics in the federal territory of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, were randomly selected. The sampling size for each clinic was conducted proportionate to the clinic’s average daily patient attendance. A total of 882 women participated in this study via a self-administered questionnaire. We administered the women’s experience with battering scale (WEB-scale) to estimate the prevalence of psychological violence and included a screening question for physical and sexual assault. The results showed that 22.0% of the women surveyed reported experiencing IPV. Ethnicity appears to be a significant predictor, with Chinese and Indian women reporting IPV at a higher rate than Malay women. Women with IPV are more likely to come from lower income households, have witnessed parental IPV, receive less social support, and have poorer psychological well-being. Our findings indicate that the prevalence of IPV among women attending urban public primary care clinics is high. Health care providers should pay close attention during clinical encounters for any sign of IPV, particularly among those presenting with risk factors. ?

Nonetheless, the dynamic operation of EV encompassing high charging and discharging currents generated from regenerative braking and acceleration, respectively, may adversely affect the cycle life of the conventional energy storage system. Hence, incorporation of supercapacitors into the energy storage system is recommended in view of its superior cycle efficiency and high power density, which aids in relieving the battery's stress and thus extends its cycle life. In this study, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) comprising Li-ion batteries and supercapacitors are modeled to evaluate its electrical and thermal performances under different driving cycles. The results obtained reveal that the dynamic stress, peak power demand and thermal performance of the battery have been significantly improved by incorporating supercapacitors into the battery pack in HESS. In comparison with the conventional battery energy storage system, the peak current demands of the battery in HESS for UDDS and US06 cycles have been reduced by 63%, 72.9% and 71.7%, respectively. This approach has shown to be effective in extending the battery's lifespan and is able to improve the safety and reliability of the conventional battery energy storage system. ? 2019 The Authors.

More than half of oral cancers in the world occur in Asia with estimated 168,850 new cases were diagnosed in this geographical region alone. Considering the rising numbers of oral cancer cases in Malaysia, association of IL10 A1082G gene polymorphism was correlated. Methodology: 41 oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cases and 48 healthy controls of comparable age, gender, and with habits like smoking, alcohol consumption and betel quid chewing were selected. In this case-control study, samples were collected from the Oral Cancer Research and Coordinating Centre (OCRCC), Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, Malaysia. Genotyping conditions were evaluated by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). The PCR products were subjected to digestion by MnlI enzyme (NEB, UK) to screen for the IL10 A-1082G. Digested DNA products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 4% (w/v) agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide and imaged under UV illumination. Chi-square test and Fisher's Exact test were used in statistical analysis. Results: AG genotypes were present in 81.3% and 86.0% of healthy control and OSCC cases respectively (OR=0.468, 95% CI=0.133-1.653). No significant association was found between IL10 A1082G polymorphism with risk habits, clinico-pathological parameters and 5-years overall survival. The findings also show no significant correlation between the IL10 genotype and features of OSCC within the case group as measured by tumor size, lymph node involvement, stage, invasive front, grading, depth, pattern of invasion. Conclusion: This study suggests that functional polymorphism AG of IL10 A1082G may have no influence with OSCC susceptibility. However, further investigation with larger sample sizes can be conducted to provide additional evidence to support the lack of association of IL10 A1082G polymorphism in oral cancer. ? 2019 IL10 Gene Polymorphism in Oral Cancer.",Genotype; Interleukin-10; Oral cancer; Oral squamous cell carcinoma; Polymorphism,"IL10 protein, human; interleukin 10; case control study; female; follow up; genetic predisposition; genetics; genotype; human; lymph node metastasis; Malaysia; male; middle aged; mouth tumor; pathology; prevalence; prognosis; secondary; single nucleotide polymorphism; squamous cell carcinoma; survival rate; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Case-Control Studies; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Genotype; Humans; Interleukin-10; Lymphatic Metastasis; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prevalence; Prognosis; Survival Rate",2-s2.0-85063782855

This is because there are several studies that have proven that IEQ influences the health and wellbeing of the residents. The study was conducted in four different apartment developments in Klang Valley, Malaysia, by using a questionnaire survey. The Human Development Index (HDI) is developed based on the data collected from the study, using the formula provided by the Ministry of Youth and Sports Malaysia in their annual Malaysia Youth Index report (IBM). The HDI has indicated that the health and well-being of the occupants in Malaysian affordable housing developments are at the neutral category, scoring 72.16 over 100. Physical condition stands at an index score of 74.29 whilst no fatigue is at poor level with a score of 56.82, whereas for psychological condition, all the indicators are in the neutral category except for No annoyance item, which is in the good category. The index was developed for IEQ factors in affordable housing with data collected from the questionnaire survey. The index developed has shown that factors of IEQ are in both the Extremely disappointed range and the Extremely important range. The acoustic comfort factor gained the lowest score for level of satisfaction whilst indoor air quality gained the highest score for level of importance of IEQ. Noise level scored the lowest in the level of satisfaction and state of health scored the highest score for level of importance.

This paper presents a novel method for the detection of breast lesions in ultrasound images using texton filter banks, local configuration pattern features, and classification, without employing any segmentation technique. The developed method was able to accurately detect and classify breast lesions and achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 96.1%, 96.5%, 95.3%, and 97.9%, respectively. The paradigm that we describe may, therefore, be useful as an effective tool to detect breast nodules during screening and in whole breast imaging, enabling clinicians to focus on images where a lesion is already known to be present. The developed method may also serve as a component for automatic breast nodule detection, and, when found, for the subsequent classification between lesion type benign versus malignant. ? 2013 IEEE.",benign; Breast; classifier; image; local configuration pattern; malignant; texton; ultrasound,Classifiers; Diseases; Feature extraction; Image segmentation; Mammography; Ultrasonic applications; Ultrasonics; benign; Breast; image; Local configurations; malignant; texton; Medical imaging,2-s2.0-85063001753

In view of this recent development, a collection of plant extracts in the MyNature50000 library showing potential anti-dengue activities were explored. In this work, the DENV2 NS2B-NS3 bioassay was setup and optimized to evaluate the potential inhibitory activity of plant extracts stored in the MyNature50000 natural product collections.

The purpose of the study presented in this paper was to examine and analyze the patterns of differences and relationships between instructional leadership and school culture of some high-and low-performing secondary schools. This study found that the school culture and instructional leadership of high-performing schools were markedly different from that of the low-performing schools. In high-performing schools, the school heads maintained positive attitudes toward students, staff, and parents; created a school culture and climate conductive to learning; and predominantly emphasized teachers’ professional values and collegiality. The findings imply that a school head should establish clear school vision and mission, set professional goals for staff, and build a two-way communication channel with teachers. School heads also should set high expectations on teachers and students, and create a positive school culture and climate of learning. ? 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

Classification and staging of the different changes (BE in particular) in the esophageal mucosa are challenging since they have a very similar appearance. Confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) is one of the newest endoscopy tools that is commonly used to identify the pathology type of the suspected area of the esophageal mucosa. However, it requires a well-trained physician to classify the image obtained from CLE. An automatic stage classification of esophageal mucosa is presented. The proposed model enhances the internal features of CLE images using an image filter that combines fractional integration with differentiation. Various features are then extracted on a multiscale level, to classify the mucosal tissue into one of its four types: normal squamous (NS), gastric metaplasia (GM), intestinal metaplasia (IM or BE), and neoplasia. These sets of features are used to train two conventional classifiers: support vector machine (SVM) and random forest. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset of 96 patients with 557 images of different histopathology types. The SVM classifier achieved the best performance with 96.05 accuracy based on a leave-one-patient-out cross-validation. Additionally, the dataset was divided into 60 training and 40 testing; the model achieved an accuracy of 93.72 for the testing data using the SVM. The presented model showed superior performance when compared with four state-of-the-art methods. Accurate classification is essential for the intestinal metaplasia grade, which most likely develops into esophageal cancer. Not only does our method come to the aid of physicians for more accurate diagnosis by acting as a second opinion, but it also acts as a training method for junior physicians who need practice in using CLE. Consequently, this work contributes to an automatic classification that facilitates early intervention and decreases samples of required biopsy. ? 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",Barrets esophagus; Confocal laser endomicroscopy; Enhancement; Fractional differentiation and integration; Grade classification,Decision trees; Diagnosis; Pathology; Statistical tests; Support vector machines; Automatic classification; Barrets esophagus; Confocal laser endomicroscopy; Conventional classifier; Digital pathologies; Fractional differentiation and integrations; Fractional integration; State-of-the-art methods; Image enhancement; Article; Barrett esophagus; cancer diagnosis; cancer staging; clinical feature; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; esophagus cancer; esophagus mucosa; histopathology; human; human tissue; in vivo study; intestine metaplasia; major clinical study; random forest; support vector machine,2-s2.0-85062625732

However, only a system which is accepted and utilised by the public would be sustainable in the long run. This study aimed to explore the perception and attitude of the Malaysian public towards a dengue early warning system. The sample consisted of 847 individuals who were 18 years and above and living/working in the Petaling District, an area adjacent to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A questionnaire consisting of personal information and three sub-measures of; i) perception, ii) attitude towards dengue early warning and iii) response towards early warning; was distributed to participants. We found that most of the respondents know about dengue fever (97.1%) and its association with climate factors (90.6%). Most of them wanted to help reduce the number of dengue cases in their area (91.5%). A small percentage of the respondents admitted that they were not willing to be involved in public activities, and 64% of them admitted that they did not check dengue situations or hotspots around their area regularly. Despite the high awareness on the relationship between climate and dengue, about 45% of respondents do not know or are not sure how this can be used to predict dengue. Respondents would like to know more about how climate data can be used to predict a dengue outbreak (92.7%). Providing more information on how climate can influence dengue cases would increase public acceptability and improve response towards climatebased warning system. The most preferred way of communicating early warning was through the television (66.4%).

To estimate the incident risk of ischemic stroke (IS) in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects according to different body mass index (BMI) and height categories. Methods. A total of 25,130 newly diagnosed T2D subjects were included in this study. All T2D subjects were enrolled consecutively from the Chronic Disease Surveillance System (CDSS) of Ningbo. Standardized incidence ratio (SIR) and its 95% confidence interval (95% CI) stratified by BMI categories and height quartiles were used to estimate the incident risk of IS in T2D subjects. Results. In total, 22,795 subjects completed the follow-up. Among them, 1268 newly diagnosed IS cases were identified, with 149,675 person-years. The SIRs of normal BMI (18.5–24.0 kg/m2), overweight (24.0–28.0 kg/m2), and obese (?28.0 kg/m2) in overall subjects were 2.56 (95% CI 1.90–3.13), 2.13 (95% CI 1.90–3.13), and 1.87 (95% CI 1.29–2.43), respectively (Ptrend &lt; 0 01), comparing to the general population of Ningbo. For each 1 kg/m2 increment in BMI, the SIR was 0.948 (95% CI 0.903–0.999). For height quartiles, the SIRs of male subjects in quartile 1 (&lt;160 cm), quartile 2 (161–165 cm), quartile 3 (165–170 cm), and quartile 4 (?171 cm) were 2.27 (95% CI 1.99–2.56), 2.01 (95% CI 1.67–2.45), 1.37 (95% CI 1.05–1.68), and 0.91 (95% CI 0.40–1.32), respectively (Ptrend &lt; 0 01). While for female subjects, the SIRs in quartile 1 (&lt;155 cm), quartile 2 (156–160 cm), quartile 3 (161–165 cm), and quartile 4 (?166 cm) were 3.57 (95% CI 3.11–3.49), 2.96 (95% CI 2.61–3.31), 1.94 (95% CI 1.51–2.36), and 1.71 (95% CI 0.95–2.47), respectively (Ptrend &lt; 0 01). Conclusion. Compared to the general population of Ningbo, T2D subjects had a higher incident risk of IS. Furthermore, the IS incident risk was not only higher in newly diagnosed T2D subjects with normal BMI but also lower in taller newly diagnosed T2D subjects.

Worldwide, most of the top 20 countries with the highest incidence and mortality rates of NPC are low- and middle-income countries. Many studies had demonstrated that EBV could be detected in the tissue, serum and plasma of NPC patients. In this study, we explored the potential of assays based on non-invasive nasal washings (NW) as a diagnostic and prognostic tool for NPC. A total of 128 patients were evaluated for NW EBV DNA loads and a subset of these samples were also tested for 27 EBV and human miRNAs shortlisted from literature. EBV DNA and seven miRNAs showed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of more than 0.7, suggestive of their potential utility to detect NPC. Logistic regression analyses suggested that combination of two NW assays that test for EBNA-1 and hsa-miR-21 had the best performance in detecting NPC. The trend of NW EBV DNA load matched with clinical outcome of 71.4% (10 out of 14) NPC patients being followed-up. In summary, the non-invasive NW testing panel may be particularly useful for NPC screening in remote areas where healthcare facilities and otolaryngologists are lacking, and may encourage frequent testing of individuals in the high risk groups who are reluctant to have their blood tested. However, further validation in an independent cohort is required to strengthen the utility of this testing panel as a non-invasive detection tool for NPC. ? 2019 The Authors.

It is always important and challenging to analyse High-throughput DNA microarray data with a number of missing values under various experimental conditions. Objectives: Graphical data visualizations of the expression of all genes in a particular cell provide holistic views of gene expression patterns, which improve our understanding of cellular systems under normal and pathological conditions. However, current visualization methods are sensitive to missing values, which are frequently observed in microarray-based gene expression profiling, potentially affecting the subsequent statistical analyses. Methods: We addressed in this study the problem of missing values with respect to different imputation methods using gene expression biplot (GE biplot), one of the most popular gene visualization techniques. The effects of missing values for mining differentially expressed genes in gene expression data were evaluated using four well-known imputation methods: Robust Singular Value Decomposition (Robust SVD), Column Average (CA), Column Median (CM), and K-nearest Neighbors (KNN). Frobenius norm and absolute distances were used to measure the accuracy of the methods. Results: Three numerical experiments were performed using simulated data (i) and publicly available colon cancer (ii) and leukemia data (iii) to analyze the performance of each method. The results showed that CM and KNN performed better than Robust SVD and CA for identifying the index gene profile in the biplot visualization in both the simulation study and the colon cancer and leukemia microarray datasets. Conclusion: The impact of missing values on the GE biplot was smaller when the data matrix was imputed by KNN than by CM. This study concluded that KNN performed satisfactorily in generating a GE biplot in the presence of missing values in microarray data. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.",GE biplot; Gene expression profile; Kernel principal component analysis; Simulation; Singular value decomposition,asparaginase; corticosteroid; cytarabine; daunorubicin; methotrexate; ribosome protein; vincristine; acute lymphoblastic leukemia; acute myeloid leukemia; Article; cancer combination chemotherapy; colon cancer; DNA microarray; gene expression; gene expression profiling; human; k nearest neighbor; kernel method; principal component analysis; priority journal; robust singular value decomposition,2-s2.0-85061733941

Unfortunately, knowledge about the health status of migrants is often limited because they are often excluded from surveys. This paper extends the susceptible-exposed-infective-removed model to handle the assumption of homogeneous mixing, the incorporation of migration and the induced death rates of the disease in modelling the spread of HIV/AIDS. These extensions demonstrate that the impact of migration on HIV persistency is critical when attempting to predict where and how fast the disease will propagate. The spectral analysis of a time series was used to determine the frequency at which the disease is spread and its equilibrium levels. The results indicate that with the persistent flow of migration into a country, the disease status changes from epidemic to endemic. If the direct flow of migration into the population is restricted, the persistent spread of the disease can be minimised. ? 2019 International Academic Press.",HIV/AIDS; Mathematical transmission modelling; Migration; SI 1 I 2 A model; Simulation,,2-s2.0-85061455180

Biomarkers may provide more accurate measures of nutrient status. This nested case–control analysis within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) investigated associations between pre-diagnostic serum folate, homocysteine, vitamins B6 and B12 and the risk of urothelial cell carcinomas of the bladder (UCC). A total of 824 patients with newly diagnosed UCC were matched with 824 cohort members. Serum folate, homocysteine, and vitamins B6 and B12 were measured. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for total, aggressive, and non-aggressive UCC were estimated using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for smoking status, smoking duration and intensity, and other potential confounders. Additionally, statistical interaction with smoking status was assessed. A halving in serum folate concentrations was moderately associated with risk of UCC (OR: 1.18; 95% CI: 0.98–1.43), in particular aggressive UCC (OR: 1.34; 95% CI: 1.02–1.75; p-heterogeneity = 0.19). Compared to never smokers in the highest quartile of folate concentrations, this association seemed only apparent among current smokers in the lowest quartile of folate concentrations (OR: 6.26; 95% CI: 3.62–10.81, p-interaction = 0.07). Dietary folate was not associated with aggressive UCC (OR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.81–1.95; p-heterogeneity = 0.14). No association was observed between serum homocysteine, vitamins B6 and B12 and risk of UCC. This study suggests that lower serum folate concentrations are associated with increased UCC risk, in particular aggressive UCC. Residual confounding by smoking cannot be ruled out and these findings require confirmation in future studies with multiple measurements. ? 2019 The Authors.

Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), with its ability to interrogate structural white matter patterns at a microarchitectural level, is a potentially useful tool for the confirmation and characterization of disease cohorts at the clinical-research interface. However, obstacles to its widespread use involve the need for consistent DTI analysis and interpretation tools across collaborator sites. We present the use of DTI profiles, a simplistic methodology to interpret white matter injury patterns based on the morphology of diffusivity parameters. We examined 13 patients with complex NPH, i.e., patients with NPH and overlay from multiple comorbidities, including vascular risk burden and neurodegenerative disease, undergoing extended CSF drainage, clinical assessments, and multi-modal MR imaging. Following appropriate exclusions, we compared the morphology of DTI profiles in such complex NPH patients (n = 12, comprising 4 responders and 8 non-responders) to exemplar DTI profiles from a cohort of classic NPH patients (n = 16) demonstrating responsiveness of white matter injury to ventriculo-peritoneal shunting. In the cohort of complex NPH patients, mean age was 71.3 ± 7.6 years (10 males, 2 females) with a mean MMSE score of 21.1. There were 5 age-matched healthy controls, mean age was 73.4 ± 7.2 years (1 male, 4 females) and mean MMSE score was 26.8. In the exemplar cohort of classic NPH patients, mean age was 74.7 ± 5.9 years (10 males, 6 females) and mean MMSE score was 24.1. There were 9 age-matched healthy controls, mean age was 69.4 ± 9.7 years (4 males, 5 females) and mean MMSE score was 28.6. We found that, despite the challenges of acquiring DTI metrics from differing scanners across collaborator sites and NPH patients presenting as differing cohorts along the spectrum of disease, DTI profiles for responsiveness to interventions were comparable. Distinct DTI characteristics were demonstrated for complex NPH responders vs. non-responders. The morphology of DTI profiles for complex NPH responders mimicked DTI patterns found in predominantly shunt-responsive patients undergoing intervention for classic NPH. However, DTI profiles for complex NPH non-responders was suggestive of atrophy. Our findings suggest that it is possible to use DTI profiles to provide a methodology for rapid description of differing cohorts of disease at the clinical-research interface. By describing DTI measures morphologically, it was possible to consistently compare white matter injury patterns across international collaborator datasets. ? 2019 Lock, Kwok, Kumar, Ahmad-Annuar, Narayanan, Ng, Tan, Kandiah, Tan, Czosnyka, Czosnyka, Pickard and Keong.",Comorbidities; Complex; DTI; MRI; Normal pressure hydrocephalus,aged; Article; brain atrophy; brain injury; brain ventricle peritoneum shunt; cerebrospinal fluid drainage; clinical article; clinical assessment; clinical research; cognition assessment; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; degenerative disease; diffusion tensor imaging; diffusivity; disease burden; female; gait; human; male; Mini Mental State Examination; morphology; multimodal imaging; normotensive hydrocephalus; prospective study; urine incontinence; white matter; white matter injury,2-s2.0-85061373027

There has been an increase of number of population health indices since the last review published more than a decade ago. Therefore, this study aims to provide an overview of existing population health indices and examine the methods used to develop them. Methods The search was conducted across three databases: PubMed, CINAHL and Emerald using four key concepts: 'health', 'index', 'context', 'develop', which was supplemented with Google searching and reference scanning. A researcher screened the titles, abstracts and subsequently full texts and confirmed the findings with the research team at each stage. Data charting was performed according to the included publications and identified indices. The collation was performed by describing the indices and made observation on its development method using a priori framework consist of four processes: underpinning theory, model or framework; data selection and processing; formation of index; testing of index. Results Twenty-six publications describing population health indices were included, and 27 indices were identified. These indices covered the following health topics: overall health outcomes (n = 15), outcomes for specific health topics (n = 4), diseases outcome (n = 6), assist health resource allocation for priority minority subgroup or geographic area (n = 4), quality of health or health care (n = 2). Twenty-one indices measure health for general populations while six measure defined subpopulations. Fourteen of the indices reported at least one of the development processes according to the a priori framework: underpinning theory, model or framework (n = 7); data selection and processing (n = 8); formation of index (n = 12); testing of index (n = 9). Conclusions Few population health indices measure specific health topics or health of specific sub-population. There is also a lack of usage of theories, models or framework in developing these indices. Efforts to develop a guideline is proposed on how population health indices can be developed systematically and rigorously to ensure validity and comprehensive assessment of the indices. ? 2019 The Author(s) JoGH.",,health status indicator; human; population health; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Population Health,2-s2.0-85060911266

In view of the fact that quercetin possesses antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities, this compound may help to protect sperm against damage in DM. In this study, in-vivo effects of quercetin on sperm parameters in DM were investigated. Material and methods: Quercetin (10, 25 and 50 mg/kg/b.w.) was given orally to streptozotocin-nicotinamide induced adult male diabetic rats for 28 days. Following treatment completion, rats were sacrificed and sperm were harvested from the cauda epididymis. Sperm count, motility, viability, hyperosmotic swelling (HOS) tail-coiled sperm and morphology were assessed. Levels of lipid peroxidation (LPO) and anti-oxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT and GPx) in sperm with and without H 2 O 2 incubation were determined by biochemical assays. Expression levels of SOD, CAT and GPx mRNAs in sperm were evaluated by qPCR. Sperm DNA integrity was estimated by flow cytometry while expression levels of the inflammatory markers NF-κβ and TNF-α in sperm were determined by Western blotting. Results: In diabetic rats receiving quercetin, sperm count and motility, viability and HOS tail-coiled sperm increased (p &lt; 0.05) while sperm with abnormal morphology decreased. Moreover, sperm SOD, CAT, GPx activities and their mRNA expression levels increased while sperm LPO, NF-κβ and TNF-α levels decreased. In normal and diabetic rat sperm incubated with H 2 O 2 , a further increase in MDA and further decreases in SOD, CAT and GPx were observed, and these were ameliorated by quercetin treatment. Conclusions: In-vivo administration of quercetin to diabetic rats helps to ameliorate sperm damage and improves sperm morphology and functions in DM. ? 2018 Termedia & Banach.",Diabetes mellitus; Inflammation; Oxidative stress; Quercetin; Sperm,catalase; glutathione peroxidase; hydrogen peroxide; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; messenger RNA; nicotinamide; quercetin; streptozocin; superoxide dismutase; tumor necrosis factor; animal experiment; animal model; antiinflammatory activity; antioxidant activity; Article; biochemical analysis; controlled study; epididymis; flow cytometry; gene expression; in vivo study; inflammation; lipid peroxidation; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein expression; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; sperm quality; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon motility; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; Western blotting,2-s2.0-85060185430

There is a growing consensus that manipulation of synaptic plasticity may reduce the strength of substance abuse-related memories. On the biological front, there are new insights that suggest memories associated with substance use disorder may follow unique neurobiological pathways that render them more accessible to pharmacological intervention. In parallel to this, research in neurochemistry has identified several potential candidate molecules that could influence the formation and maintenance of long-term memory. Drugs that target these molecules (blebbistatin, isradipine and zeta inhibitory peptide) have shown promise at the preclinical stage. In this review, we shall provide an overview of the evolving understanding on the biochemical mechanisms involved in memory formation and expound on the premise that substance use disorder is a learning disorder. ? 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.",Addiction; Blebbistatin; Cue; Isradipine; Memory; PKM zeta; Relapse,actin; blebbistatin; chlorpheniramine maleate plus phenylephrine; isradipine; myosin; protein interacting with protein kinase C; protein kinase C; basolateral amygdala; blood brain barrier; chronic brain disease; congestive heart failure; drug dependence; gene expression; hippocampus; homeostasis; human; learning disorder; long term depression; long term memory; memory; nerve cell network; neurochemistry; neurophysiology; neurotransmission; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; protein synthesis; Review; substance abuse; ventral tegmentum,2-s2.0-85060021934

This review assessed the effectiveness of interventions for childhood overweight and obesity. Methods A systematic literature search was conducted using CINAHL, EMBASE, Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO and SPORTDiscus databases to retrieve articles published from 1st January 2000 to 31 st December 2017. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-experimental studies comparing different strategies in managing overweight and obesity among schoolchildren (6 to 12 years of age) were included. The main outcomes of interest were reductions in weight related variables included anthropometry and body composition measurements. All variables were analysed using random effects meta-analyses. Results Fourteen studies were reviewed, 13 were RCTs and one was a quasi-experimental study. The risk of bias for randomisation was low risk for all of RCTs except for one, which was unclear. The risk of bias for randomisation was high for the quasi-experimental study. Most interventions incorporated lifestyle changes and behavioural strategies such as coping and problem solving skills with family involvement. The meta-analyses did not show significant effects of the intervention in reducing weight related outcomes when compared with controls. Conclusion Meta-analyses of the selected studies did not show significant effects of the interventions on weight related outcomes among overweight and obese schoolchildren when compared with controls. The role of interdisciplinary team approaches with family involvement using behaviour and lifestyle strategies to curb obesity among schoolchildren is important. ? 2019 A. Hamid, Sazlina.

Due to the advancements in artificial intelligence, early detection of DR through an automated system is more beneficial over the manual detection. At present, there are several published studies on automated DR detection systems through machine learning or deep learning approaches. This study presents a review on DR detection techniques from five different aspects namely, datasets, image preprocessing techniques, machine learning-based approaches, deep learning-based approaches, and performance measures. Moreover, it also presents the authors’ observation and significance of the review findings. Furthermore, we also discuss nine new research challenges in DR detection. After a rigorous selection process, 74 primary publications were selected from eight academic databases for this review. From the selected studies, it was observed that many public datasets are available in the field of DR detection. In image preprocessing techniques, contrast enhancement combined with green channel extraction contributed the most in classification accuracy. In features, shape-based, texture-based and statistical features were reported as the most discriminative in DR detection. The Artificial Neural Network was proven eminent classifier compared to other machine learning classifiers. In deep learning, Convolutional Neural Network outperformed compared to other deep learning networks. Finally, to measure the classification performance, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity metrics were mostly employed. This review presents a comprehensive summary of DR detection techniques and will be proven useful for the community of scientists working in the field of automated DR detection techniques. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Artificial neural network; Convolutional neural network; Diabetic retinopathy; DIARETDB1; Image preprocessing; Transfer learning,Automation; Convolution; Eye protection; Image enhancement; Neural networks; Convolutional neural network; Diabetic retinopathy; DIARETDB1; Image preprocessing; Transfer learning; Deep learning,2-s2.0-85059694741

However, data on recent causes of death in the Asia-Pacific region are limited. Hence, we analysed and compared AIDS-related and non-AIDS–related mortality in high- and low-income settings in the region. Methods: Patients from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD) and Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD) receiving cART between 1999 and 2017 were included. Causes of death verification were based on review of the standardized Cause of Death (CoDe) form designed by the D:A:D group. Cohorts were grouped as AHOD (all high-income sites), TAHOD-high (high/upper-middle income countries) and TAHOD-low (lower-middle income countries). TAHOD sites were split into high/upper-middle income and lower-middle income country settings based on World Bank classifications. Competing risk regression was used to analyse factors associated with AIDS and non-AIDS–related mortality. Results: Of 10,386 patients, 522 died; 187 from AIDS-related and 335 from non-AIDS–related causes. The overall incidence rate of deaths during follow-up was 0.28 per 100 person-years (/100 PYS) for AIDS and 0.51/100 PYS for non-AIDS. Analysis indicated that the incidence rate of non-AIDS mortality decreased from 0.78/100 PYS to 0.37/100 PYS from year groups 2003 to 2007 to 2013 to 2017 (p?<?0.001). Similarly, incidence rates of AIDS-related deaths decreased from 0.51/100 PYS to 0.09/100 PYS from year groups 2003 to 2007 to 2013 to 2017 (p?<?0.001). More recent years of follow-up were associated with reduced hazard for non-AIDS mortality (2008 to 2012: aSHR (adjusted sub-hazard ratio) 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54 to 0.96, p?=?0.027; 2013 to 2017: aSHR 0.64, 95% CI 0.47 to 0.87, p?=?0.004) compared to years 2003 to 2007. The AHOD cohort had almost twice the hazard of non-AIDS mortality compared to TAHOD-low (lower-middle income sites) (aSHR 1.72, 95% CI, 1.20 to 2.46, p?=?0.003); there were no differences between cohorts for AIDS-related mortality (p?=?0.834). Conclusion: AIDS and non-AIDS–related mortality rates have decreased over the past years in the Asia-Pacific region. There is a greater risk for non-AIDS–associated deaths in the AHOD cohort compared to lower-middle income settings in TAHOD. ? 2019 The Authors.

Marine organisms are a reservoir of anticancer peptides that await discovery. In this study, we aimed to identify cytotoxic oligopeptides from Sarcophyton glaucum. Peptides were purified from among the S. glaucum hydrolysates produced by alcalase, chymotrypsin, papain, and trypsin, guided by a methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay on the human cervical cancer (HeLa) cell line for cytotoxicity evaluation. Purification techniques adopted were membrane ultrafiltration, gel filtration chromatography, solid phase extraction (SPE), and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC). Purified peptides were identified by de novo peptide sequencing. From papain hydrolysate, three peptide sequences were identified: AGAPGG, AERQ, and RDTQ (428.45, 502.53, and 518.53 Da, respectively). Peptides synthesized from these sequences exhibited cytotoxicity on HeLa cells with median effect concentration (EC 50 ) values of 8.6, 4.9, and 5.6 mmol/L, respectively, up to 5.8-fold stronger than the anticancer drug 5-fluorouracil. When tested at their respective EC 50 , AGAPGG, AERQ, and RDTQ showed only 16%, 25%, and 11% cytotoxicity to non-cancerous Hek293 cells, respectively.

Theoretically, the choice and dose of proton pump inhibitor may also influence the suppression of H. pylori infection. The CYP2C19 genotype has recently been found to have an impact on peptic ulcer healing, H. pylori eradication and therapeutic efficacy of proton pump inhibitors. Methods: Here, we investigated the impact of the CYP2C19 genotype polymorphism and the success of triple therapy (fluoroquinolones/metronidazole/clarithromycin) on antibiotic-resistant strains in eradicating H. pylori in human subjects with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), in human subjects with peptic ulcer disease (PUD) and in asymptomatic human subjects (positive and negative for H. pylori infection). Results: Based on the CYP2C19 genotypes, determined by Droplet Digital PCR (ddPCR) analysis, we found 11.2%, 62.5% and 26.3% corresponding to rapid metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers and poor metabolizers, respectively. However, we did not find any significant effect for homozygous ABCB1 or CYP2C19?2 and CYP2C193 alleles. We detected several participants heterozygous for both ABCB1 and CYP2C192, CYP2C19?3 and CYP2C19?17 loci. The participants heterozygous for both ABCB1 and CYP2C19?2 and?3 loci should be defined as intermediate and poor metabolizers according to the haplotype analysis in the NUD, PUD and asymptomatic subjects. Conclusions: Consequently, fluoroquinolones/metronidazole/clarithromycin-based triple therapies can be used to eradicate H. pylori infection, if one does not know the CYP2C19 genotype of the patient. ? 2018.

However, many of the chemical agents used in agriculture can be hazardous to humans, non-targeted organism and environment. Plant growth promoting rhizobacteria have demonstrated a role in promoting plant growth and health under various stress conditions including disease. Unfortunately, bacterial viability degrades due to temperature and other environmental factors (Bashan et?al., Plant Soil 378: 1–33, 2014). Encapsulation of bacteria into core-shell biopolymers is one of the promising techniques to overcome the problem. This study deals with the encapsulation of Bacillus salmalaya 139SI using simple double coating biopolymer technique which consist of brown rice protein/alginate and 0·5% low molecular weight chitosan of pH 4 and 6. The influence of biopolymer to bacteria mass ratio and the chitosan pH on the encapsulation process, physic-chemical, morphology and bioactivity properties of encapsulated B.?salmalaya 139SI have been studied systematically. Based on the analysis of physico-chemical, morphology and bioactivity properties, B.?salmalaya 139S1 encapsulated using double coating encapsulation technology has promising viability pre- and postfreeze-drying with excellent encapsulation yields of 99·7 and 89·3% respectively. Significance and Impact of the Study: The need of a simple yet effective way of encapsulating plant growth promoting rhizobacteria is crucial to further improve their benefits to global sustainable agriculture practice. Effective encapsulation allows for protection, controlled release and function of the micro-organism, as well as providing a longer shelf life for the product. This research report offers an innovative yet simple way of encapsulating using double coating technology with environmentally friendly biopolymers that could degrade and provide nutrients when in soil. Importantly, the bioactivity of the bacteria is maintained upon encapsulation. ? 2018 The Society for Applied Microbiology",alginate; Bacillus salmalaya; brown rice protein isolates; encapsulation; PGPR,"biopolymer; chitosan; biopolymer; bacterium; bioactivity; biotechnology; encapsulation; growth regulator; morphology; physicochemical property; protein; rhizobacterium; rice; viability; Article; Bacillus; Bacillus salmalaya; bacterial survival; bacterial viability; biological activity; controlled study; encapsulation; field emission scanning electron microscopy; freeze drying; material coating; molecular weight; morphology; nonhuman; pH; agriculture; Bacillus; chemistry; crop; desiccation; growth, development and aging; human; metabolism; microbial viability; microbiology; physiology; plant development; procedures; soil; temperature; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria (microorganisms); Rhizobiales; Agriculture; Bacillus; Biopolymers; Chitosan; Crops, Agricultural; Desiccation; Humans; Microbial Viability; Plant Development; Soil; Temperature",2-s2.0-85056999989

Early and accurate diagnosis of this abnormality is required to prevent its further progression to these diseases. This paper aims to diagnose the risk of MetS using a new non-clinical approach called 'genetically optimized Bayesian adaptive resonance theory mapping' (GOBAM). We evolve the Bayesian adaptive resonance theory mapping (BAM) by using genetic algorithm to optimize the parameters of BAM and its training input sequence. We use the GOBAM algorithm to classify individuals as either being at risk of MetS or not at risk of MetS with a related posterior probability, which ranges between 0 and 1. A data set of 11 237 Malaysians from the CLUSTer study stratified by age and gender into four subcategories was used to evaluate the proposed GOBAM algorithm. The comparative evaluation of our results suggested that the GOBAM performs significantly better than other classical adaptive resonance theory mapping models on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and others criteria. Our algorithm gives an AUC of 86.42 %, 87.04 %, 91.08 %, and 89.24 % for the young female, middle aged female, young male, and middle-aged male subcategories, respectively. The proposed model can be used to support medical practitioners in accurate and early diagnosis of MetS. ? 2013 IEEE.",adaptive resonance theory; Bayesian ARTMAP; genetic algorithm; Metabolic syndrome,Computer science; Diagnosis; Diseases; Genetic algorithms; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Mapping; Metabolism; Principal component analysis; Resonance; Adaptive resonance theory; Bayes method; Bayesian; Metabolic syndromes; Sociology; Clustering algorithms,2-s2.0-85056546127

The reliability of the modified version of revised American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha test, while the construct validity was assessed with a principal component analysis using a varimax rotation. The parental satisfaction with pain treatment received was measured. Results: A total of 108 parents completed the questionnaire. The internal consistency of the questionnaire shows a Cronbach's alpha of 0.798. Principal component analysis revealed a four-factor structure of the 12 items which explained 69.7% of the total variance. The factors are “Interference of sleep and activity,” “Pain severity and drowsiness,” “Perception of care,” and “Adverse effects,” respectively. Our study showed that this questionnaire is a valid and reliable measure for “Interference of sleep and activity” and “Pain severity and drowsiness” factors, but not for “Perception of care” and “Adverse effects.” The results for “Perception of care” and “Adverse effects,” therefore, should be reported as individual items instead of total score. The parental satisfaction with pain treatment given was good (median 8.0; IQR 3.0). Conclusion: The modified version of revised American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire is a feasible and easy instrument to administer. The questionnaire can be used to obtain feedback from parents about the outcomes and experiences of pain management and is helpful in continuous quality evaluation and improvement in the postoperative care in a pediatric setting. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","child; pain management; parental satisfaction; postoperative care; quality improvement; survey, and questionnaires",local anesthetic agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; paracetamol; American Pain Society Patient Outcome Questionnaire; analgesia; Article; child; clinical evaluation; controlled study; cross-sectional study; drowsiness; elective surgery; female; health care quality; health survey; human; infant; major clinical study; male; newborn; pain severity; patient satisfaction; pediatric surgery; postoperative care; postoperative pain; preschool child; priority journal; school child; social participation; structured questionnaire; teaching hospital; validation study; analgesia; child parent relation; health care quality; measurement accuracy; outcome assessment; pain measurement; pediatrics; procedures; questionnaire; reproducibility; standards; United States; Child; Data Accuracy; Female; Humans; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Pain Management; Pain Measurement; Parents; Patient Satisfaction; Pediatrics; Postoperative Care; Quality of Health Care; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States,2-s2.0-85055881993

Altered proteolysis and inflammatory processes involving RPE contribute to the pathophysiology of age-related macular degeneration (AMD), but the link between these remains elusive. We report for the first time the effect of advanced glycation end products (AGE)—known to accumulate on the ageing RPE's underlying Bruch's membrane in?situ—on both key lysosomal cathepsins and NF-κB signalling in RPE. Cathepsin L activity and NF-κB effector levels decreased significantly following 2-week AGE exposure. Chemical cathepsin L inhibition also decreased total p65 protein levels, indicating that AGE-related change of NF-κB effectors in RPE cells may be modulated by cathepsin L. However, upon TNFα stimulation, AGE-exposed cells had significantly higher ratio of phospho-p65(Ser536)/total p65 compared to non-AGEd controls, with an even higher fold increase than in the presence of cathepsin L inhibition alone. Increased proportion of active p65 indicates an AGE-related activation of NF-κB signalling in a higher proportion of cells and/or an enhanced response to TNFα. Thus, NF-κB signalling modulation in the AGEd environment, partially regulated via cathepsin L, is employed by RPE cells as a protective (para-inflammatory) mechanism but renders them more responsive to pro-inflammatory stimuli. ? 2018 The Authors.

The aim of the study is to systematically explore existing self-recruited online randomized trials of self-management interventions and analyze the trials to assess their strengths and weaknesses, the quality of reporting, and the involvement of lay persons as collaborators in the research process. Study Design and Settings: The Online Randomized Controlled Trials of Health Information Database was used as the sampling frame to identify a subset of self-recruited online trials of self-management interventions. The authors cataloged what these online trials were assessing, appraised study quality, extracted information on how trials were run, and assessed the potential for bias. We searched out how public and patient participation was integrated into online trial design and how this was reported. We recorded patterns of use for registration, reporting, settings, informed consent, public involvement, supplementary materials, and dissemination planning. Results: The sample included 41 online trials published from 2002 to 2015. The barriers to replicability and risk of bias in online trials included inadequate reporting of blinding in 28/41 (68%) studies; high attrition rates with incomplete or unreported data in 30/41 (73%) of trials; and 26/41 (63%) of studies were at high risk for selection bias as trial registrations were unreported. The methods for (23/41, 56%) trials contained insufficient information to replicate the trial, 19/41 did not report piloting the intervention. Only 2/41 studies were cross-platform compatible. Public involvement was most common for advisory roles (n = 9, 22%), and in the design, usability testing, and piloting of user materials (n = 9, 22%). Conclusion: This study catalogs the state of online trials of self-management in the early 21st century and provides insights for online trials development as early as the protocol planning stage. Reporting of trials was generally poor and, in addition to recommending that authors report their trials in accordance with CONSORT guidelines, we make recommendations for researchers writing protocols, reporting on and evaluating online trials. The research highlights considerable room for improvement in trial registration, reporting of methods, data management plans, and public and patient involvement in self-recruited online trials of self-management interventions. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Internet trials; Online trials; Public involvement; Reporting guidelines; Reporting methods; Self-management; Self-recruited,adult; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; informed consent; Internet; layperson; male; medical information; patient participation; practice guideline; publication; randomized controlled trial; registration; review; scientist; selection bias; self care; writing; methodology; online system; practice guideline; procedures; randomized controlled trial (topic); self report; total quality management; Humans; Online Systems; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality Improvement; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Research Design; Self Report; Self-Management,2-s2.0-85054429232

Little is known, however, about the impact of elder abuse on sleep quality. This study examines the longitudinal relationship between EAN and sleep quality. Methods: This was a 2-year prospective cohort study involving 1927 older adults in a rural Malaysian district, Kuala Pilah. A multi-stage cluster sampling strategy was employed. After 2?years, 1189 respondents were re-assessed. EAN was determined using the modified Conflict Tactic Scale, while sleep quality was measured using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). Results: The prevalence of elder abuse was 8.1% (95% CI:6.9,9.3). Longitudinal analysis using generalized estimating equations showed that elder abuse contributed to higher PSQI scores (B:0.49, 95% CI:0.17,0.58). Sub-analyses demonstrated that psychological abuse and neglect had significant longitudinal relationships with increase of PSQI scores, while other subtypes did not. Conclusion: Abuse in late life, particularly psychological abuse and neglect, result in greater PSQI scores. Even though this may imply decline in sleep quality, our findings were not considered clinically significant as they did not exceed the clinical cut-off score of five. Nevertheless, sleep quality is an important determinant of health and a predictor of mortality among older adults; thus, understanding its relationship with abuse is useful to health care providers and policy-makers in improving health services and upgrading preventive measures. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",elder abuse and neglect; elder mistreatment; elderly abuse; poor sleep; sleep disturbances,"abuse; adult; aged; Article; cluster analysis; cohort analysis; Conflict Tactic Scale; controlled study; elder abuse; female; health care personnel; health care policy; health service; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle aged; mortality; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; prediction; prevalence; prevention; prospective study; psychological abuse; rating scale; rural area; sleep quality; very elderly; elder abuse; epidemiology; insomnia; physiology; psychology; rural population; sleep; statistics and numerical data; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Elder Abuse; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Rural Population; Sleep; Sleep Initiation and Maintenance Disorders",2-s2.0-85053519974

We present a method that mapped subjective measures (i.e. general trust, psychological) to objective measures (i.e. physiological) to predict trust. We designed interactive dialogs that represent real world service scenarios of Business, Disaster, and Healthcare. The dialogs embedded fifteen trust attributes of Ability, Benevolence and Integrity (ABI) in the communication dialogs. The ABI measures were mapped to physiological measures of facial expressions, voiced speech and camera-based heart rate. Forty-eight subjects comprising 24 males and 24 females aged between 18 to 36 years participated in the experiment. Half of the subjects were Malays and half were Chinese. Three humanoid robots represented full bodied, partial bodied and virtual agents. The experimental design was a within-subjects design. Each subject was tested on all robots in all scenarios. Subjects scored trust on an online scale that ranged from 0 to 7 points. The subjective data was analyzed using Univariate and Oneway MANOVA. The results found the humanoids to be trustworthy in different service tasks. The attributes of ‘Integrity’ and ‘Ability’ trust components are important in Business and Disaster scenarios. The estimation of trust was about 83% accurate when using this creative approach. In conclusion, humanoid robots can interact with humans using dialogs that are representative of real world communication. ? 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Dialog design; Human-Robot interaction; Trust,Anthropomorphic robots; Disasters; Ergonomics; Human computer interaction; Machine design; Man machine systems; Physiology; Dialog design; Different services; Disaster scenario; Facial Expressions; Interactive dialogs; Objective measure; Physiological measures; Trust; Human robot interaction,2-s2.0-85052300241

However, its extensive polymorphic nature represents a major obstacle to the development of a protective vaccine. Previously, a pilot study was carried out to explore the sequence variation of the C-terminal 42 kDa fragment within P. knowlesi MSP-1 gene (PkMSP-1 42 ) based on 12 clinical samples; however, further study on an adequate sample size is vital in estimating the genetic diversity of the parasite population. Methods: In the present study, we included a larger sample size of P. knowlesi (83 samples) covering eight states of Malaysia to determine the genetic polymorphism, natural selection and haplotype groups of the gene fragment coding PkMSP-1 42 . The region flanking PkMSP-1 42 was amplified by PCR and directly sequenced. Genetic diversity, haplotype diversity, population genetic differentiation and natural selection were determined in order to study the polymorphic characteristic of PkMSP-1 42 . Results: A high level of genetic diversity (Hd = 0.970 ± 0.007; cyrillic letter El = 0.01079 ± 0.00033) was observed among the 83 P. knowlesi samples, confirming the extensive genetic polymorphism exhibited among the P. knowlesi population found in Malaysia. A total of 18 distinct haplotypes with 17 amino acid changes were identified, whereby 15 were new haplotypes. High population differentiation values were observed within samples from Peninsular Malaysia and Malaysian Borneo. The 42 kDa fragments of P. knowlesi from Malaysian Borneo were found to be acting on balancing selection whilst purifying selection was suggested to act on isolates from Peninsular Malaysia. The separation of PkMSP-1 42 haplotypes into two main groups based on geographical separation has further supported the existence of two distinct P. knowlesi lineages. Conclusions: A high level of genetic diversity was observed among PkMSP-1 42 in Malaysia, whereby most of the polymorphisms were found within the 33 kDa region. Taken together, these data will be useful in order to understand the nature of P. knowlesi population in Malaysia as well as the design and development of a MSP-1 42 based knowlesi malaria vaccine. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Genetic polymorphism; Malaysia; Merozoite surface protein; Natural selection; Plasmodium knowlesi,"amino acid; merozoite surface protein 1; merozoite surface protein 1; protozoal DNA; protozoal protein; Article; Borneo; carboxy terminal sequence; gene amplification; genetic polymorphism; genetic variability; geography; haplotype; Malaysia; natural selection; nonhuman; Plasmodium knowlesi; population genetics; sample size; amino acid sequence; classification; DNA sequence; genetic polymorphism; genetic selection; genetics; malaria; nucleotide sequence; parasitology; phylogeny; Plasmodium knowlesi; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; DNA, Protozoan; Genetics, Population; Geography; Haplotypes; Malaria; Malaysia; Merozoite Surface Protein 1; Phylogeny; Plasmodium knowlesi; Polymorphism, Genetic; Protozoan Proteins; Selection, Genetic; Sequence Analysis, DNA",2-s2.0-85058558362

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of LD and LI in a young multiethnic Malaysian population. Methods: Lactase activity was measured with a 13CO2 lactose breath test using an infrared spectrometer. Each subject took 25 g of lactose naturally enriched in 13CO2 together with 250 mL of water after an overnight fast. Breath samples were collected at baseline and at 15-min intervals for 180 min. Subjects were asked to report gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms following ingestion of the lactose test meal. Results: Of the 248 subjects tested, 216 (87.1%) were lactase deficient. We found no significant differences in the presentation of LD between gender and races. LD was found in 87.5% of males and 86.8% of females (P = 0.975) and in different races: Chinese (88.5%) versus Malay (83.1%) (P = 0.399), Indian (90.5%) versus Malay (P = 0.295), and Chinese versus Indian (P = 0.902). LI was diagnosed in only 49 (19.8%) subjects; 35 patients had diarrhea, while the remainder had at least two other GI symptoms after the lactose meal.

This group of oldest-old adults deserves attention on their quality of life as long as the improvement on life expectancy is expected to continue. Thus, more and more people in China will move into this group. This paper examines the effects of intergenerational relations on the self-rated life satisfaction of the oldest-old in China by using the 2012 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey data, a total of 6,530 respondents aged 80 or over. The dependent variable is from the responses of respondents on how do they rate their life. Various socio-demographic and health variables are included in the model as controlled variables. Intergenerational relations variables include living arrangement, family interactions and intergenerational transfer. Results from the SPSS GENLIN ordinal regression model showed that living arrangements and intergenerational transfers were statistically significant in affecting the self-rated life satisfaction after controlling for socio-demographic and health variables, while family interactions in terms of visited and/or contacted by children was not significant. The feeling of being cared for among those who lived with family members and interdependence between generations have a positive effect on self-rated life satisfaction. The traditional role of family in supporting the older persons continued to be an important contributor to the self-rated life satisfaction. With the exodus of the young to the cities, family care and support are likely to be eroding in the future.

The hospital records of all patients who underwent a mandibulotomy as part of their tumour ablative surgery at two major centres in Malaysia were reviewed retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, and complications data were recorded and analyzed. Early postoperative complications occurred in 46.5% of the patients and post-radiation therapy complications in 16.1%. Wound dehiscence (27.9%) and inferior alveolar nerve injury (25.6%) were the common early postoperative complications. Dental injuries (9.7%) and plate exposure/infection (9.7%) were the common post-radiation therapy complications. Furthermore, inferior alveolar nerve injury and early abscess formation were significantly associated with the site of the mandibulotomy. The T-stage of a tumour but not the site of mandibulotomy was significantly associated with tumour margin clearance. Mandibulotomy does pose an added risk of complications for a patient undergoing tumour surgery. The benefits of mandibulotomy in terms of gaining margin clearance could not be proven in this study.

This study aims to create a profile of e-cigarette users among university students in Malaysia. METHODS The study was conducted using a cross-sectional research involving six universities in Malaysia. A semi-structured questionnaire was distributed to 1302 randomly selected students, who either smoked cigarettes and/or e-cigarettes. The 2011 version of Global Adult Tobacco Surveys (GATS) tool was used to record the respondents’ sociodemographic data. RESULTS The study revealed that 74.9% of the respondents smoked e-cigarettes; 40.3% used both cigarettes and e-cigarettes (dual users), and 34.5% were exclusive e-cigarette users. The exclusive use of e-cigarettes was related to gender (OR=0.18, 95% CI: 0.09–0.39). Also, male respondents were the majority users (95%). Of the respondents, 75.2 % were Malays, 98.0% single and most believed they have no health problems (92.1%). Further findings revealed the occurrence of adverse effects, dizziness 14.4%, cough 14.1%, and headaches 12.4%. Overall, 57.8% of the respondents used e-cigarettes as a smoking cessation tool, while others consider e-cigarettes a self-image enhancing tool or as part of social activities. CONCLUSIONS Further research on the use of e-cigarettes should be conducted on a large number of respondents in other settings to augment the findings of this study, and also guide policy making on and prevention practice of e-cigarette use, among the general student population in Malaysia. ? 2018 EMH Swiss Medical Publishers Ltd.

To date there are no studies evaluating effectiveness of an information technology based epilepsy education programme in improving AKA among teachers and students. Method: Cross-sectional study was to assess the baseline AKA of epilepsy among Malaysian teachers and secondary school students, and to examine effectiveness improving their AKA using the Interactive Animated Epilepsy Education Programme (IAEEP). AKA of teachers and students were assessed pre-and post-implementation of IAEEP. Results: Total of 54 teachers and 67 secondary students participated in this study. The baseline AKA on epilepsy among Malaysian teachers was low in the awareness domain, moderate in the knowledge domain, and positive in the attitude domain. The baseline AKA on epilepsy among students was very low in the awareness domain, low in the knowledge domain, and indifferent in the attitude domain. The AKA scores in all domains of teachers and students improved significantly after introduction of IAEEP (P<0.001). Post-IAEEP the AKA of teachers was moderate in the awareness domain, high in the knowledge domain, and very positive in the attitude domain; the AKA of students was low in the awareness domain, very high in the knowledge domain, and very positive in the attitude domain Conclusion: Our findings highlight a need for epilepsy educational programmes to be implemented in Malaysian schools.

To evaluate if it would be possible for a single study to answer the various questions posed by the original authors. To highlight areas where the design features of future studies can be optimised. Materials and Methods: Various databases were searched using synonyms for p16 AND cervix AND Malaysia. These were assessed for broad conformity to a Diagnostic Test Accuracy format. Methodological and clinical heterogeneity indicators were extracted into standardised fields. Results: There were 5 studies eligible for inclusion. Each sought to study different aspects of the disease such as diagnostic grade stratification and pathogenesis. The study type broadly conformed to a Diagnostic Test Accuracy format. The study design used was either consecutive or non-consecutive. Sample size ranged from 75 to 201. Clinical heterogeneity was present in the choice of controls with some using normal and some using inflamed tissue. Methodological heterogeneity in applying the reference test, index test and different antibody clones were present.

According to the 90-90-90 Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS strategy, HIV testing is the first crucial step in curbing the HIV epidemic. This study examines correlates of recent HIV testing among TW in Greater Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Methods: TW (N = 199) in Greater Kuala Lumpur completed a survey on healthcare access and utilization, including HIV testing history. Bivariate logistic regression and penalized multivariate logistic regression were used to explore correlates of HIV testing in the last 12 months. Results: Overall, 41.7% of TW reported having ever been tested for HIV. Among participants who were HIV negative or not sure of their HIV status (n = 187), only 18.7% (n = 35) had been tested for HIV in the last 12 months. The multivariate analysis indicated that having a primary care provider (PCP), being 26-40 years of age, and having higher mental health functioning were positively associated with recent HIV testing. Active amphetamine use and previous depression diagnosis were also associated with recent HIV testing. Conclusion: HIV testing is the first step in linking individuals to prevention and treatment interventions. Our findings suggest that having a PCP can improve engagement in HIV testing. Moreover, PCPs can serve as a valuable link to HIV treatment and prevention services. Current interventions that target social and behavioral risk factors for HIV, on their own, may be insufficient at engaging all HIV-vulnerable TW. ?

Results: The optimized assay to screen for NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors was demonstrated to be potentially useful with reasonable z? factor, coefficient variance and signal to background ratio. However, screening of synthesized thioguanine derivatives using the optimized AlphaScreen? assay revealed weak NS2B/NS3 inhibition activities. Conclusion: The AlphaScreen? assay to screen for NS2B/NS3 protease inhibitors is potentially applicable for high throughput screening. ? 2018 The Authors",Bioinformatics; Biotechnology,,2-s2.0-85057748897

A structured, group-based hypertension self-management education (HSME) programme could be a potential solution to improve BP control; however, impact of HSME programme in the Malaysian setting remain unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of a structured, group-based HSME programme on hypertensive patients’ clinical and psychosocial outcomes. Methods: A pretest-posttest quasi-experimental study design was employed. Participants attended a total of 4-weekly of the HSME programme at a community hall. Participants’ clinical and psychosocial outcomes were assessed at three time-points. Data were analysed using IBM SPSS version 23.0. Results: Forty-five participants consented to join the programme, with 36 (80.0%) attended two or more sessions. At post 1-week of intervention, participants were found to have significant improvement in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (p = 0.001), number of days spent on vigorous physical activity (p = 0.007), motivation (p = 0.005) and self-efficacy (p = 0.005). At 2-month, participants have sustained increased in HDL cholesterol, motivation and self-efficacy, in addition to a significant improvement in self-care behaviour (p = 0.002). Conclusions: The short-term HSME programme elicited certain positive clinical and psychosocial outcomes, a larger scale randomised controlled trial should be carried out to determine the effective elements of the HSME programme that lead to the self-care behavioural changes and to evaluate the long-term impacts of sustained self-care practices among community dwellers with hypertension. ? 2018 Elsevier GmbH",Collaborative; Community; Education; Self-efficacy; Self-management,calcium channel blocking agent; high density lipoprotein cholesterol; adult; Article; blood pressure; clinical article; education program; female; human; hypertension; hypertensive patient; male; middle aged; physical activity; priority journal; self care; self concept,2-s2.0-85056781825

Design: This is a retrospective study where secondary data comprising both quantitative and qualitative data, were analysed. Materials and Methods: Three cohorts of First Year medical students (n = 454) took a 5-station OSCE. Two categories of tasks were assessed. Category A assessed patient and doctor interaction while Category B assessed clinical skills. A student must be scored as satisfactory in at least four out of five stations for a pass in Category A and at least three out of five stations for a pass in Category B. A pass in both Categories A and B is required to pass the OSCE. For each cohort, overall passing percentage, as well as passing percentage for Category A and Category B of each station, was computed. Examiners' feedback on students' performance during OSCE for each station was examined. Feedback from students regarding the OSCE was also sought. Results: For Cohort 2013, Cohort 2014 and Cohort 2015, 174/179 (97.21%), 118/129 (91.47%) and 140/147 (95.24%) of students passed the OSCE respectively.

ECG signal analysis can improve human life in many ways, from diagnosing diseases among cardiac patients to managing the lifestyles of diabetic patients. Abnormalities in heart activities lead to different cardiac diseases and arrhythmia. However, some cardiac diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI) and atrial fibrillation (Af), require special attention due to their direct impact on human life. The classification of flattened T wave cases of MI in ECG signals and how much of these cases are similar to ST-T changes in MI remain an open issue for researchers. This article presents a novel contribution to classify MI and Af. To this end, we propose a new approach called deep deterministic learning (DDL), which works by combining predefined heart activities with fused datasets. In this research, we used two datasets. The first dataset, Massachusetts Institute of Technology–Beth Israel Hospital, is publicly available, and we exclusively obtained the second dataset from the University of Malaya Medical Center, Kuala Lumpur Malaysia. We first initiated predefined activities on each individual dataset to recognize patterns between the ST-T change and flattened T wave cases and then used the data fusion approach to merge both datasets in a manner that delivers the most accurate pattern recognition results. The proposed DDL approach is a systematic stage-wise methodology that relies on accurate detection of R peaks in ECG signals, time domain features of ECG signals, and fine tune-up of artificial neural networks. The empirical evaluation shows high accuracy (i.e., ?99.97%) in pattern matching ST-T changes and flattened T waves using the proposed DDL approach. The proposed pattern recognition approach is a significant contribution to the diagnosis of special cases of MI. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Artificial neural network; Cardiovascular diseases; Deep deterministic learning; Electrocardiography; Internet of medical things; Pattern recognition,"Article; artificial neural network; deep deterministic learning; electrocardiogram; heart contraction; heart disease; Internet; learning; pattern recognition; T wave; atrial fibrillation; automated pattern recognition; electrocardiography; female; heart infarction; human; image processing; Internet; male; pathology; procedures; Atrial Fibrillation; Deep Learning; Electrocardiography; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Internet; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Neural Networks (Computer); Pattern Recognition, Automated",2-s2.0-85056094418

Materials and Methods: A search of the Medline, Embase, Science Citation Index, Current Contents and PubMed databases identified English-language randomized clinical trials comparing LARR and ORR. The meta-analysis was prepared in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Thirteen outcome variables were analyzed. Random effects meta-analyses were performed due to heterogeneity. Results: A total of 14 randomized clinical trials that included 3843 rectal resections (LARR 2096, ORR 1747) were analyzed. The summary point estimates favored LARR for the intraoperative blood loss, commencement of oral intake, first bowel movement, and length of hospital stay. There was significantly longer duration of operating time of 38.29 minutes for the LARR group. Other outcome variables such as total complications, postoperative pain, postoperative ileus, abdominal abscesses, postoperative anastomotic leak, reintervention and postoperative mortality rates were found to have comparable outcomes for both cohorts. Conclusions: LARR was associated with significantly reduced blood loss, quicker resumption of oral intake, earlier return of gastrointestinal function, and shorter length of hospital stay at the expense of significantly longer operating time. Postoperative morbidity and mortality and analgesia requirement for both these groups were comparable. LARR seems to be a safe and effective alternative to ORR; however, it needs to be performed in established colorectal units with experienced laparoscopic surgeons. ? 2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Methods: SfSAG2 and SfSAG3 genes were isolated from S.?falcatula and expressed in Escherichia coli expression system. A total of 348 serum samples [volunteers from both islands (n?=?100), non-Sarcocystis parasitic infections patients (n?=?50) and healthy donors (n?=?100)] were collected and tested with purified SfSAGs in Western blot and ELISA assays to measure the seroprevalence of human sarcocystosis. Results: None of the sera in this study reacted with rSfSAG2 by Western blot and ELISA. For rSfSAG3, relatively high prevalence of sarcocystosis was observed in Tioman Island (75.5%) than in Pangkor Island (34%) by Western blot. In ELISA, the different prevalence rate was observed between Tioman Island (43.8%) and Pangkor Island (37%). The prevalence rate in other parasitic infections (amoebiasis, cysticercosis, filariasis, malaria, toxocariasis and toxoplasmosis) was 30% by Western blot and 26% by ELISA. Only 8% (by Western blot) and 10% (by ELISA) of healthy donors showed reactivity towards rSfSAG3. Conclusion: This is the first study reporting a seroprevalence of sarcocystosis in Pangkor and Tioman Islands, Malaysia.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effective removal of POPs – namely, p-tert-Butylphenol and Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- – from landfill leachate using locust bean gum (LBG), and in comparison with commonly used alum. The response surface methodology coupled with a Box–Behnken design was employed to optimize the operating factors for optimal POPs removal. A quadratic polynomial model was fitted into the data with the R2 values of 0.97 and 0.96 for the removal of p-tert-Butylphenol and Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl), (S)-, respectively. The physicochemical characteristics of the flocs produced by LBG and alum were evaluated with Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). The infrared spectra of LBG-treated floc were identical with LBG powder, but there was some variation in the peaks of the functional groups, signifying the chemical interactions between flocculants and pollutant particles resulting from POPs removal. The results showed that p-tert-Butylphenol and Pyridine, 3-(1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinyl)-, (S)- obtained 96% and 100% removal using 500 mg/L of LBG at pH 4. pH have a significant effect on POPs removal in leachate. It is estimated that treating one million gallons of leachate using alum (at 1 g/L dosage) would cost US$39, and using LBG (at 500 mg/L dosage) would cost US$2. LBG is eco-friendly, biodegradable and non-toxic and, hence, strongly recommended as an alternative to inorganic coagulants for the treatment of POPs in landfill leachate. ?

The natural history of sacral chordoma is a slow growing tumour arising at the midline of the lower sacrum that can invade the sacrum and progressively increase in size expanding cranially and anteriorly. Metastasis is very rare even when the tumour is large. Sacral chordoma affects males more than females and is more commonly found in middle age and elderly patients. Case presentation: A 25 years old female had neglected an extremely large midline sacral mass for 2 years. On presentation to hospital, she had been bed bound for the past 2 years. The sacral mass was so large that it prevented her from lying down supine and sitting on the wheelchair comfortably. Clinical examination showed a 40 cm × 30 cm × 20 cm hard mass over the sacrum that involved both buttocks and the gluteal fold. Neurological exam of bilateral lower limb was normal. Computed Tomography Scan of the Pelvis showed a large destructive sacrococcygeal mass measuring 43 cm × 38 cm × 27 cm with extension into the presacral space resulting in anterior displacement of the rectum, urinary bladder and uterus; and posterior extension into the dorsal soft tissue with involvement of the gluteus, piriformis, and left erector spinae muscles. Biopsy taken confirmed Chordoma. This patient was managed by a multidisciplinary team in an Oncology referral centre. The patient had undergone Wide En Bloc Resection and Sacrectomy, a complex surgery that was associated with complications namely bleeding, surgical site infection and neurogenic bowel and bladder. Six months post operatively the patient was able to lie supine and sit on wheelchair comfortably. She required extensive rehabilitation to help her ambulate in future. Conclusion: This is a rare case of neglected sacral chordoma in a young female treated with Wide En Bloc Resection and Sacrectomy associated with complications of this complex surgery.

Recently, the ankyrin repeat protein targeting the HIV-1 capsid, AnkGAG1D4, showed a negative effect on the viral assembly of the HIV-1NL4-3 laboratory strain. To extend its potential for future clinical application, the activity of AnkGAG1D4 in the inhibition of other HIV-1 circulating strains was evaluated. Chimeric NL4-3 viruses carrying patient-derived Gag/PR-coding regions were generated from 131 antiretroviral drug-na?ve HIV-1 infected individuals in northern Thailand during 2001?2012. SupT1, a stable T-cell line expressing AnkGAG1D4 and ankyrin non-binding control (AnkA32D3), were challenged with these chimeric viruses. The p24CA sequences were analysed and classified using the K-means clustering method. Among all the classes of virus classified using the p24CA sequences, SupT1/AnkGAG1D4 demonstrated significantly lower levels of p24CA than SupT1/AnkA32D3, which was found to correlate with the syncytia formation. This result suggests that AnkGAG1D4 can significantly interfere with the chimeric viruses derived from patients with different sequences of the p24CA domain. It supports the possibility of ankyrin-based therapy as a broad alternative therapeutic molecule for HIV-1 gene therapy in the future.",ankyrin; Gag polyprotein; HIV-1; protein therapy; virus assembly inhibitor,"ankyrin; antivirus agent; Gag protein; virus RNA; amino acid sequence; cell line; chemistry; drug effect; gene vector; genetics; HEK293 cell line; human; Human immunodeficiency virus 1; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; molecular model; physiology; protein conformation; Thailand; virology; virus assembly; virus replication; Amino Acid Sequence; Ankyrin Repeat; Antiviral Agents; Cell Line; gag Gene Products, Human Immunodeficiency Virus; Genetic Vectors; HEK293 Cells; HIV Infections; HIV-1; Humans; Models, Molecular; Protein Conformation; RNA, Viral; Thailand; Virus Assembly; Virus Replication",2-s2.0-85056630525

In this study, we aim to elucidate the activity of IL-17A in the protection against Cryptococcus neoformans, an opportunistic fungus that causes fatal meningoencephalitis among AIDS patients. For this purpose, we examined if C. neoformans infection triggers IL-17A secretion in vivo using wildtype C57BL/6 mice. In addition, an enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) reporter and a knockout (KO) mouse models were used to track the source of IL-17A secretion and explore the protective function of IL-17A, respectively. Results: Our findings showed that in vivo model of C. neoformans infection demonstrated induction of abundant IL-17A secretion. By examining the lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), mediastinal lymph node (mLN) and spleen of the IL-17A-EGFP reporter mice, we showed that intranasal inoculation with C. neoformans promoted leukocytes lung infiltration. A large proportion (~ 50%) of the infiltrated CD4+ helper T cell population secreted EGFP, indicating vigorous TH17 activity in the C. neoformans-infected lung. The infection study in IL-17A-KO mice, on the other hand, revealed that absence of IL-17A marginally boosted fungal burden in the lung and accelerated the mouse death. Conclusion: Therefore, our data suggest that IL-17A is released predominantly from TH17 cells in vivo, which plays a supporting role in the protective immunity against C. neoformans infection. ? 2018 The Author(s).",CD4+ T cells; Cryptococcus neoformans; IL-17A; Macrophages; TH17 cells,"enhanced green fluorescent protein; interleukin 17; Il17a protein, mouse; interleukin 17; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; C57BL 6 mouse; CD4+ T lymphocyte; controlled study; cytokine production; cytokine release; disease association; in vivo study; knockout mouse; leukocyte; lung infiltrate; lymphocyte function; mediastinum lymph node; mouse; nonhuman; pathogen load; protein function; pulmonary cryptococcosis; spleen; Th17 cell; wild type mouse; animal; biosynthesis; C57BL mouse; cryptococcosis; Cryptococcus neoformans; disease model; immunology; lung mycosis; lymph node; Th17 cell; Animals; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Cryptococcosis; Cryptococcus neoformans; Disease Models, Animal; Interleukin-17; Lung Diseases, Fungal; Lymph Nodes; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Spleen; Th17 Cells",2-s2.0-85056389828

There is a need to take significant measures such as screening for the risk of a fall as a means of prevention and management. A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine discriminative and predictive ability of physical performance measures in identifying the risk of fall among Malaysian community dwelling older adults. Three hundred twenty-five Malaysian community dwelling older adults aged 60 years and above (67.67+ 5.5 years) participated in this study. This study was a part of a larger longitudinal study ‘LRGS TUA’. Physiological Profile Assessment (PPA), a comprehensive tool for quantifying risk of fall was used as a standard measure of comparison to 6 Meter Gait Speed (GS), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and Walking While Talking (WWT) tests to establish discriminative and predictive ability. Participants recorded incidence of falls in a ‘falls diary’ over a span of six months. To determine the optimum cut off scores of the test identified to classify fall risk, receiver operator curves (ROC) were used and its sensitivity and specificity were calculated. A significant mean difference between fallers and non-fallers was demonstrated only with TUG test (p<0.05). TUG test cut off score in discriminating older adults at risk of fall was established at eight seconds, with a sensitivity and specificity of 83.95% and 32.4%, respectively, in this study. Eighty-four percent older adults who experienced a fall in our study were identified to be at risk of fall when screened using this TUG cut off score. Our study results suggested TUG test to be an optimal screening tool for risk of fall among community dwelling older adults. ? 2018 Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia.

The HCD and CCT at term serve as a baseline for premature infants. Sixty-three premature infants were enrolled in a prospective case series. HCD, CCT, and IOP were measured. RetCam images of the optic discs were used to evaluate the cup-disc ratio (CDR) and read by an independent masked observer. Data were collected at between preterm (32-36 weeks) and again at term (37-41 weeks) postconceptual age. Left eye measurements were used for statistical analysis. Left eye findings were combined to construct predictive models for HCD and CCT. The mean HCD was 9.1 mm (standard deviation [SD] = 0.7 mm) at preterm and 10.0 mm (SD = 0.52 mm) at term. The mean CCT preterm was 618.8 (SD = 72.9) mm and at term 563.9 (SD = 50.7) mm, respectively. The average preterm CDR was 0.31 and at maturity was 0.33. Average IOP of preterm and term was 13.1 and 14.11 mm Hg, respectively. There was significant linear correlation between HCD with the postmenstrual age (r = 0.40, P &lt; .01) and the head circumference (r = 0.33, P &lt; .05). Predictive models were constructed for HCD (R2 = 0.52, 0.2 mm/wk) and CCT (R2 = 0.23, 11.4 mm/wk) with postconceptual ages. The HCD and CCT variation did not affect IOP reading over time. CCT was not correlated with birth parameters and decreased as the infant reached term. Corneal diameter correlated with gestational age at birth and head circumference.

However, there is no firm conclusion on acute neuroelectrophysiological changes among methadone-treated subjects as well as the effectiveness of methadone in restoring brain electrical abnormalities among heroin addicts. This study aims to investigate the acute and short-term effects of methadone administration on the brain’s electrophysiological properties before and after daily methadone intake over 10?weeks of treatment among heroin addicts. EEG spectral analysis and single-trial event-related potential (ERP) measurements were used to investigate possible alterations in the brain’s electrical activities, as well as the cognitive attributes associated with MMN and P3. The results confirmed abnormal brain activities predominantly in the beta band and diminished information processing ability including lower amplitude and prolonged latency of cognitive responses among heroin addicts compared to healthy controls. In addition, the alteration of EEG activities in the frontal and central regions was found to be associated with the withdrawal symptoms of drug users. Certain brain regions were found to be influenced significantly by methadone intake; acute effects of methadone induction appeared to be associative to its dosage. The findings suggest that methadone administration affects cognitive performance and activates the cortical neuronal networks, resulting in cognitive responses enhancement which may be influential in reorganizing cognitive dysfunctions among heroin addicts. This study also supports the notion that the brain’s oscillation powers and ERPs can be utilized as neurophysiological indices for assessing the addiction treatment traits. ? 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Cognitive dysfunction; Methadone maintenance treatment (MMT); Neuro-electrophysiology; Spatial-spectral analysis,"diamorphine; methadone; methadone; narcotic analgesic agent; adult; Article; beta rhythm; brain function; brain region; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; disease association; drug effect; electroencephalogram; event related potential; heroin dependence; human; latent period; male; mismatch negativity; nerve cell network; power spectrum; priority journal; treatment duration; withdrawal syndrome; auditory evoked potential; brain; electroencephalography; female; heroin dependence; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; psychology; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Analgesics, Opioid; Brain; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Female; Heroin Dependence; Humans; Male; Methadone; Middle Aged; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85055256644

However, there is limited information on the incidence and risk factors associated with renal dysfunction among this population in Asia. Methods: We used data from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database. Patients were included if they started antiretroviral therapy during or after 2003, had a serum creatinine measurement at antiretroviral therapy initiation (baseline), and had at least 2 follow-up creatinine measurements taken ?3?months apart. Patients with a baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ?60?mL/min/1.73?m2 were excluded. Chronic kidney disease was defined as 2 consecutive eGFR values ?60?mL/min/1.73?m2 taken ?3?months apart. Generalized estimating equations were used to identify factors associated with eGFR change. Competing risk regression adjusted for study site, age and sex, and cumulative incidence plots were used to evaluate factors associated with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Results: Of 2547 patients eligible for this analysis, tenofovir was being used by 703 (27.6%) at baseline. Tenofovir use, high baseline eGFR, advanced HIV disease stage, and low nadir CD4 were associated with a decrease in eGFR during follow-up. Chronic kidney disease occurred at a rate of 3.4 per 1000 patient/years. Factors associated with CKD were tenofovir use, old age, low baseline eGFR, low nadir CD4, and protease inhibitor use.

From 100 digitally recorded flexible bronchoscopies (FB), we related the various macroscopic features to airway neutrophil % to develop a FB-derived bronchitis score (BScoreexp). We aimed to develop a FB-derived bronchitis tool. Methods: FB recordings for six visualised features: secretions (amount and color) and mucosal appearance (erythema, pallor, ridging, oedema) based on pre-determined criteria on a pictorial chart were assessed by two physicians independently, blinded to the clinical history. These features were used to obtain various models of BScoreexp that were plotted against bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) neutrophil % using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Inter- and intra-rater agreement (weighted-kappa, K) were assessed from 30 FBs. Results: Using BAL neutrophilia of 20% to define inflammation, the highest area under ROC (aROC) of 0.71, 95%CI 0.61-0.82 was obtained by the giving three times weightage to secretion amount and color and adding it to erythema and oedema.

This study aimed to examine public awareness about ADR reporting in Malaysia and patients’ confidence in reporting ADRs. Methods: Using a cross-sectional design and convenient sampling, data were collected in public areas within Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, via face-to-face interview with a structured questionnaire. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the significant predictors of patients’ confidence in ADR reporting. Results: Out of 860 consented respondents achieving a response rate of 73.5%, only 69 (8%) were aware of the Malaysian ADR monitoring system. The majority (60%) of the respondents indicated they had the confidence to report ADRs. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that ease in completing the ADR reporting form was the strongest variable predictive of confidence to report ADRs (odds ratio [OR], 18.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 10.55-32.25). Increased confidence in ADR reporting was also associated with education level. Respondents with a higher education level were more likely to be confident to report ADRs compared to those with primary or no formal education (OR, 2.49; 95% CI, 0.77-8.1). Conclusions: Lack of awareness of the ADR monitoring system is still prevalent among Malaysian patients. The ease of completing the ADR form and education level are predictive of patient confidence to report ADRs. These factors should be considered in designing public promotional activities to encourage patient contributions to pharmacovigilance. ?

The objective of this study was to identify the potential of an Internet-based programme to improve sexual and reproductive health (SRH) knowledge among Malaysian young people. Design: A pre-test/post-test design was used to study the potential of the Malaysian Care for Adolescent Project (MyCAP) website for online SRH education. Created by health professionals, the SRH module provides detailed and accurate information about the male and female reproductive systems, the stages of adolescent development, puberty (bodily development, menstruation and wet dreams), teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and social situations such as avoiding premarital sex. Setting: A total of 209 young adolescents aged 12 years were recruited from a school in Lembah Pantai, Kuala Lumpur. Method: Students were randomly assigned to either an Internet-based or a conventional method group. The Internet-based intervention group consisted of 101 young people (50 boys and 51 girls), while the conventional method group consisted of 108 participants (62 boys and 46 girls). Results: Using the Internet-based method, there was an increase of 3.88 in the mean knowledge score of participants from pre- to post-intervention. The Internet-based method had a greater eta-squared score of 0.59 compared to the conventional method, which had an eta-squared score of 0.41 (p <.001). Conclusion: The results revealed that the Internet-based method significantly improved adolescents’ knowledge of SRH. Since the majority of students have access to the Internet, using online learning could provide an alternative educational method for teaching SRH. ?

Based on current concepts in tumour related inflammation the inflammatory marker, neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio was tested to find its relationship with prognosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Objective: To investigate the effect of the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio on prognosis in non-metastatic primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients and to further refine the cut off between high and low neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio values. Methods: The medical charts of patients with histologically confirmed nasopharyngeal carcinoma from 1st January 2005 until 31st December 2009 were reviewed retrospectively and theneutrophil–lymphocyte ratio was calculated to see if there was any association between their higher values with higher failure rates. Results: Records of 98 patients (n = 98) were retrieved and reviewed. Only neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio (p = 0.004) and tumor node metastasis staging (p = 0.002) were significantly different between recurrent and non-recurrent groups, with the neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio being independent of tumor node metastasis staging (p = 0.007). Treatment failure was significantly higher in the high neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio group (p = 0.001). Disease free survival was also significantly higher in this group (p = 0.000077). Conclusion: High neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio values are associated with higher rates of recurrence and worse disease free survival in non-metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients undergoing primary curative treatment. ? 2017 Associa??o Brasileira de Otorrinolaringologia e Cirurgia C?rvico-Facial",Biomarker; Nasopharyngeal carcinoma; Neutrophil–lymphocyte ratio; Prognosis; Survival,"antineoplastic agent; tumor marker; adult; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer diagnosis; cancer prognosis; cancer radiotherapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; cancer survival; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease free survival; female; histology; human; human tissue; lymph node metastasis; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; metastasis; nasopharynx carcinoma; neutrophil lymphocyte ratio; retrospective study; treatment failure; aged; blood; ethnology; lymphocyte; lymphocyte count; middle aged; nasopharynx carcinoma; neutrophil; pathology; prognosis; survival analysis; tumor recurrence; young adult; Adult; Aged; Biomarkers, Tumor; Female; Humans; Lymphocyte Count; Lymphocytes; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Neutrophils; Prognosis; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85034436524

This study aimed to examine if the ROSA is able to evaluate pain severity in the lower back, shoulder and neck of office workers accurately. Methods: Overall, 142 participants (height: 1.80 ± 0.15 m, BMI: 26.08± 6.70, age: 35±15 yr) with at least a year of working experience completed both questionnaires, the online ROSA and the Cornell musculoskeletal discomfort, in 2016 in Malaysia. Results: Relationship between the total scores of both questionnaires for lower back, shoulder and neck pain were significant but exhibited a weak to moderate relationship (range of r values from 0.012 (CI 95%,-0.153-0.176) to 0.503 (CI 95%, 0.369-0.616). Conclusion: The online ROSA does not appear to be a reasonable tool for evaluating the severity of lower back, shoulder and neck pain among office workers as the correlations were low. We suggest continued use of the musculoskeletal discomfort questionnaire.

Methods: A 3-(4,5-Dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay was used to analyze the pinnatane A selectivity in inducing cell death in cancer and normal cells. Various biological assays were carried out to analyze the anti-cancer properties of pinnatane A, such as a live/dead assay for cell death microscopic visualization, cell cycle analysis using propidium iodide (PI) to identify the cell cycle arrest phase, annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate (annexin V-FITC)/PI flow cytometry assay to measure percentage of cell populations at different stages of apoptosis and necrosis, and DNA fragmentation assay to verify the late stage of apoptosis. Results: The MTT assay identified pinnatane A prominent dose- and time-dependent cytotoxicity effects in Hep3B and HepG2 cells, with minimal effect on normal cells. The live/dead assay showed significant cell death, while cell cycle analysis showed arrest at the G0/G1 phase in both cell lines. Annexin V-FITC/PI flow cytometry and DNA fragmentation assays identified apoptotic cell death in Hep3B and necrotic cell death in HepG2 cell lines. Conclusions: Pinnatane A has the potential for further development as a chemotherapeutic agent prominently against human liver cells. ? 2018 by the authors.",Anti-cancer; Apoptosis; Cell cycle arrest; Necrosis; Triterpene,"antineoplastic agent; plant extract; apoptosis; cell cycle checkpoint; cell membrane; cell proliferation; chemical structure; chemistry; DNA cleavage; drug effect; human; liver tumor; Meliaceae; metabolism; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Membrane; Cell Proliferation; DNA Cleavage; Humans; Liver Neoplasms; Meliaceae; Molecular Structure; Plant Extracts",2-s2.0-85055553892

Adolescents with T2DM develop similar complications as in adults, including cardiovascular disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, renal insufficiency, and chronic renal failure. Although regular medical follow-up is essential to avoid long-term complications, patients with diabetes mellitus need to perform holistic self-care activities such as opting for a healthy diet, physical activity, self-monitoring, and proper medication. To the best of our knowledge, only a limited number of studies have focused on self-care activities and self-management, including self-care practices, supportive networks, and self-care education programs in adolescent with T2DM. Some of the studies focused on the appreciation of self-care in adolescents with T2DM. This review aimed to analyse self-care and self-management among adolescents with T2DM, and discuss the impact of self-care and self-management on glycaemic control. The difficulties faced by adolescents in self-managing their disease are also highlighted. Such information is essential for healthcare providers in promoting self-care practices among adolescents with T2DM. A thorough search of the literature was performed using three databases: Medline, Google Scholar, and Scopus. The articles focused on self-care and self-management of adolescents patients with T2DM aged between 12 and 19 years old were included. Findings from this review reveal that healthy food adaptation, adequate physical activity, proper medication practices, and regular glucose monitoring are the most common self-care practices. Parental involvement and clinician encouragement also contribute toward the practice of self-care and self-management among the adolescents with T2DM. In conclusion, independent self-management regimens and supportive networks for appropriate administration are vital factors to enhance clinical outcomes of adolescents with T2DM.

This study aims to develop an online artefact detection system based on adaptive (dynamic) template matching, suitable for continuous PPG monitoring during daily living activities or in the intensive care units (ICUs). Approach: Several master templates are initially generated by applying principal component analysis to data obtained from the PhysioNet MIMIC II database. The master template is then updated with each incoming clean PPG pulse. The correlation coefficient is used to classify the PPG pulse into either good or bad quality categories. The performance of our algorithm was evaluated using data obtained from two different sources: (i) our own data collected from 19 healthy subjects using the wearable Sotera Visi Mobile system (Sotera Wireless Inc.) as they performed various movement types; and (ii) ICU data provided by the PhysioNet MIMIC II database. The developed algorithm was evaluated against a manually annotated 'gold standard' (GS). Main results: Our algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 91.5% ± 2.9%, with a sensitivity of 94.1% ± 2.7% and a specificity of 89.7% ± 5.1%, when tested on our own data. When applying the algorithm to data from the PhysioNet MIMIC II database, it achieved an accuracy of 98.0%, with a sensitivity and specificity of 99.0% and 96.1%, respectively. Significance: The proposed method is simple and robust against individual variations in the PPG characteristics, thus making it suitable for a diverse range of datasets. Integration of the proposed artefact detection technique into remote monitoring devices could enhance reliability of the PPG-derived physiological parameters. ? 2018 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",adaptive template; artefact; continuous PPG; master template; signal quality assessment,"adolescent; adult; algorithm; artifact; electronic device; evaluation study; female; human; male; middle aged; motion; movement (physiology); photoelectric plethysmography; principal component analysis; procedures; signal processing; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Algorithms; Artifacts; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motion; Movement; Photoplethysmography; Principal Component Analysis; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Wearable Electronic Devices; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85054721760

Ten human premolar root samples were subjected to citric acid treatment before scanning by OCT. The extracted relative attenuation coefficient (μR) from backscattered OCT signals was shown to increase with the duration of acid challenge. Validated against roughness measurements (rSa) from scanning electron microscopy scans, μR is significantly correlated with rSa indicative of severity of erosion (p &lt; 0.01, r = 0.9195). We conclude that the OCT attenuation coefficient of the immediate subsurface in eroded dentine is a potential surrogate measure for its surface roughness. However, further work should be performed to study how it relates to the surface and immediate subsurface changes effected by other mechanical wear before it could unequivocally be used as a surrogate measurement for surface roughness. ? 2018 Optical Society of America.",,"Erosion; Optical tomography; Scanning electron microscopy; Acid treatments; Attenuation coefficient; Backscattered signal; Erosion process; Surface characteristics; Surface roughness changes; Surrogate measures; Validation study; Surface roughness; chemistry; dentin; human; optical coherence tomography; premolar tooth; procedures; reproducibility; surface property; tooth disease; ultrastructure; validation study; Bicuspid; Dentin; Humans; Reproducibility of Results; Surface Properties; Tomography, Optical Coherence; Tooth Erosion",2-s2.0-85054853409

However, less emphasis has been placed to co-relate the gene expression and metabolism of antibiotic resistant pathogens. This study aims to elucidate gene expression and variations in metabolism of multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae after exposure to antibiotics. Phenotypic responses of three genotypically distinct carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) strains untreated and treated with sub-lethal concentrations of imipenem were investigated via phenotype microarrays (PM). The gene expression and metabolism of the strain harboring bla NDM-1 before and after exposure to sub-lethal concentration of imipenem were further investigated by RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) and 1 H NMR spectroscopy respectively. Most genes related to cell division, central carbon metabolism and nucleotide metabolism were downregulated after imipenem treatment. Similarly, 1 H NMR spectra obtained from treated CRKP showed decrease in levels of bacterial end products (acetate, pyruvate, succinate, formate) and metabolites involved in nucleotide metabolism (uracil, xanthine, hypoxanthine) but elevated levels of glycerophosphocholine. The presence of anserine was also observed for the treated CRKP while FAPγ-adenine and methyladenine were only present in untreated bacterial cells. As a conclusion, the studied CRKP strain exhibited decrease in central carbon metabolism, cell division and nucleotide metabolism after exposure to sub-lethal concentrations of imipenem. The understanding of the complex biological system of this multidrug resistant bacterium may help in the development of novel strategies and potential targets for the management of the infections. ? 2018, ? 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",1 H NMR; antibiotic resistance; Carbapenem resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae; phenotype microarrays; RNA-Seq,"1 methyladenine; 3 o beta d galactopyranosyl d arabinose; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid; acetic acid; amino acid; ammonium sulfate; anserine; arginine; cadaverine; carbapenem; carbohydrate; d raffinose; formic acid; glycerophosphorylcholine; histamine; Hydroxyl proline; hypoxanthine; imipenem; lactate sodium; malic acid; norleucine; organic compound; phenylalanine; pyruvic acid; sodium formate; stachyose; succinic acid; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; uracil; xanthine; antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; imipenem; adaptation; amino acid metabolism; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial survival; carbon utilization; cell division; citric acid cycle; controlled study; DNA library; DNA microarray; down regulation; drug metabolism; gene expression; genetic variation; glycolysis; growth rate; Klebsiella pneumoniae; membrane transport; multidrug resistance; next generation sequencing; nonhuman; nucleotide metabolism; osmolarity; pH; phenotype; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; RNA sequence; sublethal dose; upregulation; antibiotic resistance; bacterium identification; drug effect; genetics; human; Klebsiella infection; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; physiology; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacterial Proteins; Bacterial Typing Techniques; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Imipenem; Klebsiella Infections; Klebsiella pneumoniae; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Phenotype",2-s2.0-85055886223

In this paper, we study the possibility of applying machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches to predict the number of confirmed dengue fever (DF) cases in Kuala Lumpur. We identified several contribution factors correlate to a dengue outbreak. In addition to the two frequently used factors (daily mean temperature and daily rainfall), we also took into account the enhanced vegetation index (EVI), humidity and wind speed as input factors to our prediction engines. We collected and cleansed data on these factors and the daily DF incidents in Kuala Lumpur from 2002 to 2012. We then used these data to train and evaluate our 3 ML/DL models. Among the three models, GA-RNN was the best performer and achieved a MAE of 10.95 for DF incidence prediction. ? 2018 IEEE.",deep learning; dengue outbreak prediction; machine learning,Forecasting; Learning systems; Machine learning; Risk perception; Wind; Daily rainfall; Dengue fevers; Enhanced vegetation index; Input factors; Mean temperature; Mosquito-borne disease; Prediction engines; Three models; Deep learning,2-s2.0-85070553311

StO2 of ACE showed a decrease whereas in ACE+FES-LCE, the arm muscles demonstrated increasing StO2 from rest in all of VO2) peak respectively. StO2 of FES-LCE displayed a decrease at 40% VO2 peak and steady increase for 60% and 80%, whereas ACE+FES-LCE revealed a steady increase from rest at all VO2 peak. ACE+FES-LCE elicited greater StO2 in both limbs which suggested that during this exercise, upper- and lower-limb muscles have higher blood flow and improved oxygenation compared to ACE or FES-LCE performed alone.

Methods: Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 35 oral cancer patients with TNM stage III to IV disease, who were treated at six tertiary regional centres managing oral cancer throughout Malaysia. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, coded using NVivo (version 10.0) qualitative software and analysed using framework analysis. Results: Participants interpreted their early symptoms as a minor condition and did not consider it as requiring immediate attention. Four types of coping strategies causing delayed help-seeking emerged: 1) self-remedy 2) self-medication 3) seeking traditional healers and 4) consulting general medical practitioners (GPs) instead of dentists. Socio-economic factors, cultural beliefs and religious practices have some influence on diagnostic delay. Conclusion: Low levels of public knowledge and awareness regarding early signs and symptoms of oral cancer as well as GPs' misdiagnosis of early lesions results in delayed diagnosis. ? 2018, Asian Pacific Organization for Cancer Prevention.",Awareness; Health-seeking behaviour; Oral cancer; Patient related-factors; Self-regulatory model,"adult; aged; awareness; delayed diagnosis; developing country; female; general practitioner; health behavior; human; Malaysia; male; middle aged; mouth tumor; pathology; patient attitude; patient referral; physiology; qualitative research; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Awareness; Delayed Diagnosis; Developing Countries; Female; General Practitioners; Health Behavior; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Mouth Neoplasms; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Qualitative Research; Referral and Consultation",2-s2.0-85055612631

Severe dengue, however, is rarely reported among individuals with SLE. Here, whether sera of patients with SLE cross-neutralize dengue virus (DENV) was investigated. Serum samples were obtained from individuals with SLE who were dengue IgG and IgM serology negative. Neutralization assays were performed against the three major DENV serotypes. Of the dengue serology negative sera of individuals with SLE, 60%, 61% and 52% of the sera at 1/320 dilution showed more than 50% inhibition against dengue type-1 virus (DENV-1), DENV-2 and DENV-3, respectively. The neutralizing capacity of the sera was significantly greater against DENV-1 (P < 0.001) and DENV-3 (P < 0.01) than against DENV-2 (P < 0.05). Neutralization against the DENV correlated with dengue-specific IgG serum titers below the cut-off point for dengue positivity. Depletion of total IgG from the sera of patients with SLE resulted in significant decreases of up to 80% in DENV inhibition, suggesting that IgG plays an important role. However, some of the SLE sera was still able to neutralize DENV, even with IgG titers <0.1 OD absorbance. Our findings suggest that sera of patients with SLE contain IgG, and possibly other type of antibodies, that can cross-neutralize DENV, which may explain the rarity of severe dengue in individuals with SLE. Further studies, are needed to further substantiate this finding and to elucidate the specific neutralizing epitopes recognized by the sera of individuals with SLE. ? 2018 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",autoantibodies; autoimmunity; dengue; systemic lupus erythematosus,"immunoglobulin G antibody; immunoglobulin M antibody; epitope; immunoglobulin G; immunoglobulin M; neutralizing antibody; virus antibody; adult; animal cell; antibody titer; Article; controlled study; cross reaction; Dengue virus; Dengue virus 1; Dengue virus 2; Dengue virus 3; female; human; major clinical study; male; nonhuman; systemic lupus erythematosus; virus inhibition; virus neutralization; animal; blood; Chlorocebus aethiops; dengue; Dengue virus; heterologous immunity; immunology; Malaysia; middle aged; serodiagnosis; serotype; systemic lupus erythematosus; Vero cell line; Adult; Animals; Antibodies, Neutralizing; Antibodies, Viral; Cercopithecus aethiops; Cross Reactions; Dengue; Dengue Virus; Epitopes; Female; Humans; Immunity, Heterologous; Immunoglobulin G; Immunoglobulin M; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Neutralization Tests; Serogroup; Vero Cells",2-s2.0-85055196628

Our objectives were to evaluate the use of CSA in our institution, its efficacy, ease to use and safety. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis conducted in a tertiary centre. Records of all patients who underwent surgery and received CSA between December 2008 and July 2017 were reviewed. Their demographic profiles, type and duration of surgery were analysed. The outcomes measured were the success of CSA, technical evaluation and difficulties encountered, intraoperative haemodynamics, usage of vasopressors and any reported complications. Statistical analysis was done using Chi-square test. Results: Three hundred and eighteen patients (94%) successfully underwent surgery using CSA. Twenty cases (6%) had failed CSA, of which five of them had CSA insertion failure, while the rest failed to complete the operation under CSA, thus requiring conversion to general anaesthesia. Patients who have had an initial intrathecal local anaesthetic (LA) volume ?1.5 ml had higher odds (odds ratio (OR) 2.78; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.70–4.57) of developing hypotension compared to those who had <1.5 ml (P < 0.001). There were no reported post-dural puncture headache, neurological sequelae or infection. Conclusion: CSA is a useful anaesthetic technique with low failure rate. The key to achieving haemodynamic stability is by giving a small initial bolus, then titrating the block up to required height using aliquots of 0.5 ml of intrathecal LA through the catheter. ? 2018 Indian Journal of Anaesthesia.",Continuous spinal anaesthesia; Haemodynamic stability; High-risk,bupivacaine; fentanyl; morphine; propofol; adult; aged; Article; body mass; cerebrovascular accident; Charlson Comorbidity Index; chronic kidney failure; chronic lung disease; dementia; diabetes mellitus; female; headache; human; hypertension; hypotension; major clinical study; male; observational study; outcome assessment; Parkinson disease; prospective study; retrospective study; spinal anesthesia; tertiary care center,2-s2.0-85055120224

Methodology Retrospective review of children under 12 years of age, admitted with HAdV pneumonia, between January 2011 and July 2013, in a single centre in Malaysia. HAdV isolated from nasopharyngeal secretions were typed by sequencing hypervariable regions 1–6 of the hexon gene. Patients were reviewed for respiratory complications. Results HAdV was detected in 131 children of whom 92 fulfilled inclusion criteria. Median (range) age was 1.1 (0.1–8.0) years with 80% under 2 years. Twenty percent had severe disease with a case-fatality rate of 5.4%. Duration of admission (p = 0.02) was independently associated with severe illness. Twenty-two percent developed respiratory complications, the commonest being bronchiolitis obliterans (15.2%) and recurrent wheeze (5.4%). The predominant type shifted from HAdV1 and HAdV3 in 2011 to HAdV7 in 2013. The commonest types identified were types 7 (54.4%), 1(17.7%) and 3 (12.6%). Four out of the five patients who died were positive for HAdV7. Infection with type 7 (OR 8.90, 95% CI 1.32, 59.89), family history of asthma (OR 14.80, 95% CI 2.12–103.21) and need for invasive or non-invasive ventilation (OR 151.84, 95% CI 9.93–2.32E) were independent predictors of respiratory complications. Conclusions One in five children admitted with HAdV pneumonia had severe disease and 22% developed respiratory complications. Type 7 was commonly isolated in children with severe disease. Family history of asthma need for invasive or non-invasive ventilation and HAdV 7 were independent predictors of respiratory complications. ? 2018 Lim et al.

However, the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)- A nd carbapenemase-producing clinical P. Aeruginosa has not been reported in Malaysia. This study aimed to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profiles, resistance genes, pulsotypes, and sequence types (STs) of clinical P. Aeruginosa from a Malaysian tertiary hospital. These characteristics were analyzed by disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration, polymerase chain reaction, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), and MLST for 199 nonreplicate clinical strains. The susceptibility of the strains toward the carbapenems and piperacillin-tazobactam was the lowest (?90%), while ?90% of the strains remained susceptible to all other classes of antimicrobial agents tested. The multidrug-resistant strains displayed high level resistance to cephalosporins (48 to ?256 mg/L) and carbapenems (4-32 mg/L). Eleven strains harbored class 1 integrons containing blaGES-13, blaVIM-2, blaVIM-6, blaOXA-10, aacA(6′)-Ib, aacA(6′)-II, aadA6, and gcuD gene cassettes. Extra-integron genes, blaGES-20, blaIMP-4, blaVIM-2, and blaVIM-11, were also found.

Therefore, we investigated the association of genetic polymorphisms and AEs. A total of 110 Malaysian breast cancer patients were enrolled in the present study. Rash, fatigue, nausea, and oral mucositis were associated with gene polymorphisms, which can be used as predictive biomarkers for docetaxel nonhematologic AEs. Purpose: Nonhematologic adverse events (AEs) of docetaxel constitute an extra burden in the treatment of cancer patients and necessitate either a dose reduction or an outright switch of docetaxel for other regimens. These AEs are frequently associated with genetic polymorphisms of genes encoding for proteins involved docetaxel disposition. Therefore, we investigated that association in Malaysian breast cancer patients. Materials and Methods: A total of 110 Malaysian breast cancer patients were enrolled in the present study, and their blood samples were investigated for different single nucleotide polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism. AEs were evaluated using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Results: Fatigue, nausea, oral mucositis, and vomiting were the most common nonhematologic AEs. Rash was associated with heterozygous and mutant genotypes of ABCB1 3435C>T (P <.05). Moreover, patients carrying the GG genotype of ABCB1 2677G>A/T reported more fatigue than those carrying the heterozygous genotype GA (P <.05). The presence of ABCB1 3435-T, ABCC2 3972-C, ABCC2 1249-G, and ABCB1 2677-G alleles was significantly associated with nausea and oral mucositis. The coexistence of ABCB1 3435-C, ABCC2 3972-C, ABCC2 1249-G, and ABCB1 2677-A was significantly associated with vomiting (P <.05). Conclusion: The prevalence of nonhematologic AEs in breast cancer patients treated with docetaxel has been relatively high.

It emerged in Malaysia in 2008 and autochthonously spread in the midst of endemic DENV-3/I circulation. The spread, however, was limited and the virus did not cause any major outbreak. Spatiotemporal distribution study of DENV-3 over the period between 2005 and 2011 revealed that dengue cases involving DENV-3/III occurred mostly in areas without pre-existing circulating DENV-3. Neutralisation assays performed using sera of patients with the respective infection showed that the DENV-3/III viruses can be effectively neutralised by sera of patients with DENV-3 infection (50% foci reduction neutralisation titres (FRNT50) > 1300). Sera of patients with DENV-1 infection (FRNT50 ? 190), but not sera of patients with DENV-2 infection (FRNT50 ? 50), were also able to neutralise the virus. These findings highlight the possibility that the pre-existing homotypic DENV-3 and the cross-reacting heterotypic DENV-1 antibody responses could play a role in mitigating a major outbreak involving DENV-3/III in the Klang Valley, Malaysia. ?

Objective(s): The effects of tamarind seeds (T) on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism in rats were studied. Rats were offered basal diet (BD) with T (2%, 4% or 8%) or without T. Materials and methods: Feeding and growth performance in rats were measured and samples of liver and blood were analyzed for glycogen content and levels of cholesterol and glucose respectively. Results: The inclusion of T in the diet influences the feeding and growth performance in rats. The serum cholesterol level was reduced (p < 0.05) in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats fed on basal diet (BD) containing 4% and 8% T (0.24 ± 0.14 g/l and 0.31 ± 0.06 g/l respectively) compared to control (0.79 ± 0.04 g/l). The serum glucose levels in the spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) was lower (50.74 ± 2.50 mg/dl; p < 0.05) than control (93.52 ± 10.83 mg/dl) at 4% T. Incorporation of increasing doses of T resulted in linear increase of glycogen storage in livers of SD rats fed on BD and high sucrose diet.

A nationwide interviewer-administered questionnaire survey was conducted in 2013. An open-ended questionnaire pertaining to Islamic medicine was used to increase the probability of capturing maximum data. This survey implemented a multistage design, stratified by state, proportionate to the size of the state population and was representative of the Malaysian population. Post-survey classification of results was performed accordingly. Complex data analysis was carried out using SPSS 16.0. The discussion was identified and categorised into various sections. The paper concludes that Islamic medicine has a major influence in the Malaysian Muslim community compared to other alternatives. Further, its potential for growth and importance especially for treating spiritual ailments cannot be denied. The respondents indicated that two factors motivate Islamic medicine in Malaysia: (1) the Muslim community opts for alternative healing because of their dissatisfaction with conventional methods; (2) Islamic medicine focuses only on healing spiritual-related problems. The average perception of respondents is that the function of Islamic medicine in healing physical diseases is undervalued and that it is not suitable to replace the functions of modern health institutions. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Function; Islamic medicine; Malaysia; Perception; Spiritual disorder,human; Islam; Malaysia; religion; Humans; Islam; Malaysia; Religion and Medicine,2-s2.0-85032357027

Large body of evidence from various cardiovascular registries reflecting more 'real-world' experience might contribute to the knowledge on how best to treat this special cohort. We aim to analyze the outcomes of Malaysian STEMI patients with renal impairment treated with coronary angioplasty. Methods: Utilizing the Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Database-Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (NCVD-PCI) registry data from 2007 to 2014, STEMI patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) were stratified into presence (GFR &lt; 60 mls/min/1.73m 2 ) or absence (GFR ? 60 mls/min/1.73m 2 ) of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Patient's demographics, extent of coronary artery disease, procedural data, discharge medications, short (in-hospital) and long (1 year) term outcomes were critically assessed. Results: A total of 6563 patients were included in the final analysis. STEMI CKD cohort was predominantly male (80%) with mean age of 61.02 ± 9.95 years. They had higher cardiovascular risk factors namely diabetes mellitus (54.6%), hypertension (79.2%) and dyslipidemia (68.8%) in contrast to those without CKD. There were notably higher percentage of CKD patients presented with Killip class 3 and 4; 24.9 vs 8.7%. Thrombolytic therapy remained the most commonly instituted treatment regardless the status of kidney function. Furthermore, our STEMI CKD cohort also was more likely to receive less of evidence-based treatment upon discharge. In terms of outcomes, patients with CKD were more likely to develop in-hospital death (OR: 4.55, 95% CI 3.11-6.65), MACE (OR: 3.42, 95% CI 2.39-4.90) and vascular complications (OR: 1.88, 95% CI 0.95-3.7) compared to the non-CKD patients. The risk of death at 1-year post PCI in STEMI CKD patients was also reported to be high (HR: 3.79, 95% CI 2.84-5.07). Conclusion: STEMI and CKD is a deadly combination, proven in our cohort, adding on to the current evidence in the literature. We noted that our STEMI CKD patients tend to be younger than the Caucasian with extremely high prevalence of diabetes mellitus. The poor outcome mainly driven by immediate or short term adverse events peri-procedural, therefore suggesting that more efficient treatment in this special group is imperative. ? 2018 The Author(s).",,"fibrinolytic agent; adult; adverse outcome; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; chronic kidney failure; cohort analysis; comorbidity; coronary artery disease; data base; demography; diabetes mellitus; disease course; disease registry; dyslipidemia; evidence based medicine; female; fibrinolytic therapy; glomerulus filtration rate; hospital discharge; hospital mortality; hospital patient; human; hypertension; kidney function; long term care; major clinical study; Malaysian National Cardiovascular Disease Database Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; male; middle aged; mortality risk; prevalence; priority journal; retrospective study; Review; short course therapy; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; transluminal coronary angioplasty; treatment outcome; aged; chronic kidney failure; clinical trial; coronary angiography; diagnostic imaging; factual database; kidney; Malaysia; mortality; multicenter study; pathophysiology; percutaneous coronary intervention; postoperative complication; register; risk assessment; risk factor; ST segment elevation myocardial infarction; time factor; treatment outcome; Aged; Coronary Angiography; Databases, Factual; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Kidney; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Percutaneous Coronary Intervention; Postoperative Complications; Registries; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; ST Elevation Myocardial Infarction; Time Factors; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85053775638

However, an anxiety measure that has been validated for use with Malaysian students is still lacking. Thus, the main objective of the current study is to examine the psychometric proprieties of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (Form Y) (STAI), and to assess the suitability of the factorial model in the context of Malaysia. The STAI contains separate scales for measuring state and trait anxiety. A Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was conducted to test and to compare the two-factor model (State Anxiety and Trait Anxiety) and the four-factor model (State Anxiety Present, State Anxiety Absent, Trait Anxiety Present, and Trait Anxiety Absent) of STAI. In addition, the reliability and validity of the model were also tested. The sample consisted of 341 university students from one of the universities in Kota Kinabalu, Sabah. The results supported a better fit to the data for the four-factor model of STAI. To improve composite reliability and the average variance extracted (AVE) of the constructs, one item was removed from each of the State Anxiety Present factor, Trait Anxiety present factor, and Trait Anxiety Absent factor. Convergent validity for the four-factor model was also improved by the removal of the three items. The findings also suggested that the STAI may have some discriminant validity issues.

Walking is the most accessible type of physical activity as it is safe and its benefits are similar to exercise. The researchers introduced a walking football game to obese primary school children with the aim of gathering pilot data on the changes in the anthropometrical and fitness level throughout the 12-week program. METHODS: This was a cohort repeated-measures study involving 32 healthy male school children aged 8-11-year-old with the BMI of more than 21 kg/m2 (&gt;95th centile) from 8 primary schools around Petaling Jaya. The subjects were instructed to train in a multiple short 6-a-side semi-structured moderate-intensity walking football training sessions for 75 minutes each week. Anthropometry, body composition, and 6-minute walk test were measured at the baseline and after the program ended. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in the mean weight, BMI, muscle mass and 6-minute walk test distance post-intervention, P&lt;0.001. Even though there was a reduction in the body fat percentage, it was not statistically significant P&gt;0.05. It was also noted that there was an inverse moderate strength correlation between age and fat mass (r -0.458, P&lt;0.01), body fat percentage (r -0.448, P&lt;0.05), and a moderately positive correlation between age and muscle mass (r 0.395, P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates positive outcomes on the anthropometrical and fitness changes among the obese school children participating in a 12-week walking football program, a low impact moderate-intensity exercise. The cost-effectiveness of walking football suggests its feasibility to be implemented nationwide to combat the rising problems of inactivity and childhood obesity.

Significant health benefits result from regular physical activity, many of which are important for kidney transplant patients. Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of 10-week combined exercises on Interferon Gamma (IFNγ), body fat percentage (BF%) and body mass index (BMI) in kidney transplant patients. Method: In a randomized controlled experimental design, 44 kidney transplant patients aged 20-50 years were randomly divided into two groups of exercise (n=23) and control (n=21). The exercise group participated in a cumulative training program for 10 weeks, three days a week, 60–90 minutes per day at 40-65% of predicted maximal heart rate reserve. A 5 ml venous blood sample and anthropometric parameters were taken from the subjects at baseline and after 10 weeks. Results: The exercise group showed an improvement in BF% (from 31.80±5.64 to 28.86 ± 5.82, p =0.001) and BMI (from 26.23 ± 1.81 to 25.45 ± 2.11, p = 0.001), but there was no significant change in the IFNγ level (from 0.06 ± 0.02 to 0.06 ± 0.02, p = 0.829). There was a significant difference between the control and exercise groups for BF% (p = 0.001) and BMI (p = 0.001). Conclusion: As a take-home message, it should be mentioned that combined exercise intervention is inexpensive and portable and can be performed at home or health centers for kidney transplant patients to reduce their weight and BF%.

The purpose of the present study was to examine handgrip strength (HGS) and its associated factors among community-dwelling older people in Sri Lanka. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Kandy district using multistage sampling. A total of 999 older people were recruited, with a female preponderance. Data were collected using interviewer-administered questionnaires on demographic characteristics, depression, and physical activity. Anthropometric measurements including weight, height, mid-upper arm circumference, calf circumference, and HGS were recorded. Complex sample general linear model was used to examine the association between HGS and its associated factors. Results: The mean highest HGS of the study group was 12.56 kg (95% confidence interval: 11.94–13.19). Male older people had a higher HGS (17.02, 95% confidence interval: 15.55–18.49 kg) than females (10.59, 95% confidence interval: 10.12–11.06 kg). For both men and women, older age was associated with lower HGS, while mid-upper arm circumference was associated with better HGS. Diabetes mellitus, vegetarian diet, and alcohol consumption were associated with HGS for women only. Conclusion: Men had a higher HGS compared with women. Age, mid-upper arm circumference, diabetes mellitus, vegetarian diet, and alcohol consumption were factors associated with HGS among community-dwelling older people in Kandy district, Sri Lanka. HGS can be used as a feasible strategy to improve health status of older people by community health nurses. ? 2018",aged; hand strength; independent living,"adult; aged; alcohol consumption; arm circumference; Article; cross-sectional study; descriptive research; diabetes mellitus; female; grip strength; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; sex difference; Sri Lanka; vegetarian diet; very elderly; anthropometry; drinking behavior; exercise; geriatric assessment; hand strength; independent living; middle aged; pathophysiology; physiology; procedures; sexual characteristics; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alcohol Drinking; Anthropometry; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus; Diet, Vegetarian; Exercise; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Hand Strength; Humans; Independent Living; Male; Middle Aged; Sex Characteristics; Sri Lanka",2-s2.0-85053693627

Objective: To determine medications available and used in the management of six symptoms at the end of life among pediatric palliative care practitioners in Asia Pacific. To identify alternative pharmacological strategies for these six symptoms if the oral route was no longer possible and injections are refused. Design and Setting: An online survey of all Asia Pacific Hospice Palliative Care Network (APHN) members was carried out to identify medications used for six symptoms (pain, dyspnea, excessive respiratory secretions, nausea/vomiting, restlessness, seizures) in dying children. Two scenarios were of interest: (1) hours to days before death and (2) when injectables were declined or refused. Results: There were 54 responses from 18 countries. Majority (63.0%) of respondents were hospital based. About half of all respondents were from specialist palliative care services and 55.6% were from high-income countries. All respondents had access to essential analgesics. Several perceived that there were no available drugs locally to treat the five other commonly encountered symptoms. There was a wide variation in preferred drugs for treating each symptom that went beyond differences in drug availability or formulations. Conclusion: Future studies are needed to explore barriers to medication access and possible knowledge gaps among service providers in the region, so that advocacy and education endeavors by the APHN may be optimized. ? 2018, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.",Asia Pacific; end of life; palliative care; pediatrics; symptoms; treatment,analgesic agent; Article; Asia; child; drug bioavailability; dying; dyspnea; health care access; high income country; human; life; nausea; online analysis; pain; palliative therapy; pediatrics; pharmacognosy; restlessness; seizure; sputum; symptom; terminal care,2-s2.0-85053287212

Although changes in gene expression during disease are often measured, it is difficult to predict metabolic fluxes from gene expression data. Here we explore the hypothesis that changes in gene expression for enzymes tend to parallel flux changes in biochemical reaction pathways in the brain metabolic network. This hypothesis is the basis of a computational method to predict metabolic flux changes from post-mortem gene expression measurements in Parkinson’s disease (PD) brain. Results We use a network model of central metabolism and optimize the correspondence between relative changes in fluxes and in gene expression. To this end we apply the Least-squares with Equalities and Inequalities algorithm integrated with Flux Balance Analysis (Lsei-FBA). We predict for PD (1) decreases in glycolytic rate and oxygen consumption and an increase in lactate production in brain cortex that correspond with measurements (2) relative flux decreases in ATP synthesis, in the malate-aspartate shuttle and midway in the TCA cycle that are substantially larger than relative changes in glucose uptake in the substantia nigra, dopaminergic neurons and most other brain regions (3) shifts in redox shuttles between cytosol and mitochondria (4) in contrast to Alzheimer’s disease: little activation of the gamma-aminobutyric acid shunt pathway in compensation for decreased alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase activity (5) in the globus pallidus internus, metabolic fluxes are increased, reflecting increased functional activity. Conclusion Our method predicts metabolic changes from gene expression data that correspond in direction and order of magnitude with presently available experimental observations during Parkinson’s disease, indicating that the hypothesis may be useful for some biochemical pathways. Lsei-FBA generates predictions of flux distributions in neurons and small brain regions for which accurate metabolic flux measurements are not yet possible. ? 2018 Supandi, van Beek.

Bupropion is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor which can potentially improve erectile function among male patients on methadone (MMT). This is a phase II, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial, involving 80 MMT male patients (73.4%) with mean age of 42.83 years ±9.68. These MMT male patients were randomly assigned into two groups to receive bupropion and placebo, respectively. The primary efficacy outcome measure was the difference between the two groups in end-point mean improvement scores using the measurement of Clinical Global Impression Scale adapted for Sexual Function (CGI-SF) at baseline (week 0) and at weeks 2, 4, and 6. Malay version of the sexual desire inventory-2 (SDI-2-BM) and Malay version of International Index of Erectile Function 15 (Mal-IIEF-15) domain scores were evaluated as secondary parameters. Improvement of the end-point mean from baseline were seen across the scores of SDI-2-BM (mean difference = 11.77 ± 2.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) [3.89, 19.54], p <.001) and Mal-IIEF-15 (mean difference = 8.37 ± 2.71, 95% CI [15.75, 0.99], p =.02), and the total plasma testosterone level (mean difference = 4.03, 95% CI [0.90, 7.15], p =.01). A categorical improvement of “much/very much improved” (CGI-SF score = 2) was reported by 58.3% (n = 21/36) of bupropion SR-assigned versus 27.7% (n = 10/36) placebo-assigned patient. Bupropion was well tolerated with no serious adverse events reported other than insomnia (17.7%).

Mammographic density is a strong, independent risk factor for breast cancer, and some breast cancer risk factors have been shown to modify mammographic density. However, the effect of physical activity on mammographic density, studied predominantly among Caucasians, has yielded conflicting results. In this study, we examined, in an Asian population, the association between physical activity and mammographic density. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 2,377 Malaysian women aged 40–74?years. Physical activity information was obtained at screening mammogram and mammographic density was measured from mammograms by the area-based STRATUS method (n = 1,522) and the volumetric Volpara? (n = 1,200) method. Linear regression analyses were performed to evaluate the association between physical activity and mammographic density, adjusting for potential confounders. Results: We observed that recent physical activity was associated with area-based mammographic density measures among postmenopausal women, but not premenopausal women. In the fully adjusted model,?postmenopausal women with the highest level of recent physical activity had 8.0?cm2 [95% confidence interval: 1.3, 14.3?cm2] lower non-dense area and 3.1% [0.1, 6.3%] higher area-based percent density, compared to women with the lowest level of recent physical activity. Physical activity was not associated to volumetric mammographic density. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the beneficial effects of physical activity on breast cancer risk may not be measurable through mammographic density. Future research is needed to identify appropriate biomarkers to assess the effect of physical activity on breast cancer risk. ? 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Asian; Biomarker; Breast cancer; Mammographic density; Physical activity,adult; aged; Article; breast cancer; breast density; cancer risk; cohort analysis; controlled study; cross-sectional study; female; human; major clinical study; Malaysian; mammography; obesity; physical activity; postmenopause; premenopause; priority journal; Asian continental ancestry group; breast; breast tumor; ethnic group; exercise; middle aged; risk factor; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Breast; Breast Density; Breast Neoplasms; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; Ethnic Groups; Exercise; Female; Humans; Mammography; Middle Aged; Premenopause; Risk Factors,2-s2.0-85050961671

It forms resistant biofilm structures in food processing facilities after sanitization, consequently creating a public health concern. Many studies on the metabolism and transmission of L. monocytogenes has provided insights into its intracellular infection process, however there is limited understanding on the substrate utilization of the bacteria. Therefore, the main objective of this study was to investigate the carbon and nitrogen substrate catabolism and the biofilm forming potential of 3 Malaysian L. monocytogenes strains (LM41, LM92 and LM115) previously isolated from ready-to-eat foods. Biolog Phenotype Microarray (PM) system was used to study the catabolic activity of the foodborne strains in 190 carbon and 380 nitrogen sources. PM analysis showed that the carbon and nitrogen catabolic activity of L. monocytogenes strains were considerably limited and these strains utilised Tween 40 and Tween 80, which are commonly used for the sanitation in food and meat processing industries. Furthermore, all 3 strains showed strong biofilm forming potential in nutrient-rich and nutrient-limited media, irrespective of the serogroups. The data generated could be utilised to develop alternative measure to inhibit biofilm formation in L. monocytogenes in the food processing environment. ? 2018, Bundesamt f?r Verbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL).",Biofilm; Foodborne pathogen; Listeria monocytogenes; Phenotype microarray; Ready-to-eat food,,2-s2.0-85048500658

This study explored the sexual experiences of young adult women in the developing context of the country. A qualitative phenomenological approach was adopted. Purposive sampling was employed, and a total of 20 participants were recruited, comprised of the major ethnic groups in Malaysia. Four main themes emerged through the phenomenological analysis of the data, including: conditional pleasure; social honour and women’s purity; risk and responsibility; and transcendence of love and emotion. The findings of this study revealed that sexuality was experienced under the control of religion and society with the concern of conserving a woman’s purity and social honour; and imposing risks and responsibility on women. Despite the awareness of women’s right to experience sexual pleasure, it was commonly perceived that sexual activities beyond the social norms will result in social shaming and guilt.

The aims of this study were to investigate the association of insulin therapy with mammographic density (MD) as an intermediate phenotype for breast cancer and to assess associations with long-term elevated circulating insulin levels using a genetic score comprising 18 insulin-associated variants. Methods: We used data from the KARolinska MAmmography (Karma) project, a Swedish mammography screening cohort. Insulin-treated patients with type 1 (T1D, n = 122) and type 2 (T2D, n = 237) diabetes were identified through linkage with the Prescribed Drug Register and age-matched to 1771 women without diabetes. We assessed associations with treatment duration and insulin glargine use, and we further examined MD differences using non-insulin-treated T2D patients as an active comparator. MD was measured using a fully automated volumetric method, and analyses were adjusted for multiple potential confounders. Associations with the insulin genetic score were assessed in 9437 study participants without diabetes. Results: Compared with age-matched women without diabetes, insulin-treated T1D patients had greater percent dense (8.7% vs. 11.4%) and absolute dense volumes (59.7 vs. 64.7 cm3), and a smaller absolute nondense volume (615 vs. 491 cm3). Similar associations were observed for insulin-treated T2D, and estimates were not materially different in analyses comparing insulin-treated T2D patients with T2D patients receiving noninsulin glucose-lowering medication. In both T1D and T2D, the magnitude of the association with the absolute dense volume was highest for long-term insulin therapy (? 5 years) and the long-acting insulin analog glargine. No consistent evidence of differential associations by insulin treatment duration or type was found for percent dense and absolute nondense volumes. Genetically predicted insulin levels were positively associated with percent dense and absolute dense volumes, but not with the absolute nondense volume (percentage difference [95% CI] per 1-SD increase in insulin genetic score = 0.8 [0.0; 1.6], 0.9 [0.1; 1.8], and 0.1 [- 0.8; 0.9], respectively). Conclusions: The consistency in direction of association for insulin treatment and the insulin genetic score with the absolute dense volume suggest a causal influence of long-term increased insulin exposure on mammographic dense breast tissue. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Breast cancer; Diabetes; Insulin; Insulin genetic score; Mammographic density,"insulin; insulin glargine; antidiabetic agent; insulin; insulin glargine; adult; age distribution; Article; body mass; breast cancer; breast density; cancer risk; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; digital mammography; disease duration; drug exposure; family history; female; genetic association; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin genetic score; insulin treatment; long term exposure; major clinical study; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; observational study; phenotype; prospective study; scoring system; single nucleotide polymorphism; treatment duration; aged; blood; breast; breast density; breast tumor; case control study; drug effect; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; mammography; pathology; risk factor; Sweden; time factor; Adult; Aged; Breast; Breast Density; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Hypoglycemic Agents; Insulin; Insulin Glargine; Mammography; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prospective Studies; Risk Factors; Sweden; Time Factors",2-s2.0-85054932395

This study aimed to assess the molecular mechanisms of action, and to further evaluate the antiangiogenic effect of this extract. NAFLD was induced by eight weeks of high-fat diet, and treatment was applied for four weeks. Antiangiogenic activity was assessed by aortic ring assay and by in vitro tests. Our findings demonstrated that the therapeutic effects of 50% ME among NAFLD rats, were associated with a significant increase in serum adiponectin, reduction in the serum levels of RBP4, vaspin, progranulin, TNF-α, IL-6, and significant downregulation of the hepatic gene expression of PPARγ, SLC10A2, and Collα1. Concomitantly, 50% ME of P. niruri has exhibited a potent antiangiogenic activity on ring assay, cell migration, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and tube formation, without any cytotoxic effect. Together, our findings revealed that the protective effects of P. niruri against NAFLD might be attributed to its antiangiogenic effect, as well as to the regulation of adipocytokines and reducing the expression of adipogenic genes. ? 2018 by the authors.

Tumour expression of the ERG oncogene occurs in the majority of patients with prostate cancer in Western studies. This is considered to be oncogenic as ERG acts as a transcription factor to regulate genes involved in tumour proliferation and invasion. In this study we investigated expression of ERG in Malaysian men with prostate cancer. Methods: Tissues were collected from 80 patients with clinically detected prostate cancer and treated with radical prostatectomy. Cases were tested for ERG by immunohistochemistry using the mouse monoclonal antibody EP111. All blocks on 48 cases were tested in order to determine the extent of heterogeneity of ERG expression within individual cases. ERG expression was analysed in relation to patient age, ethnicity and tumour stage and grade. Results: Forty-six percent of cases were ERG positive. There was no significant association between ERG and tumour grade or stage. Sixty-nine percent of Indian patients had ERG positive tumours; this was significantly higher (p=0.031) than for Chinese (40%) and Malay (44%) patients. Heterogeneity of ERG expression, in which both positive and negative clones were present, was seen in 35% of evaluated cases. Evaluation by tumour foci showed younger patients had more ERG positive tumour foci than older patients (p=0.01). Indian patients were more likely to have the majority of tumour foci with ERG staining positively, compared to either Chinese or Malay patients (P <0.01). Conclusion: In this study, tumour expression of ERG was more likely to occur in patients of Indian ethnicity. ? 2018, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

Aim: This study aimed to examine the retention rate among patients enrolled in a tertiary hospital MMT programme in Malaysia, as well as factors predicting retention and mortality among these patients. Methods: A total of 164 patients were enrolled in a MMT programme implemented at a tertiary centre in Malaysia between 2005 to 2013. During enrolment, sociodemographic data, blood investigations and urine toxicology were recorded, along with Opiate Treatment Index (OTI) and World Health Organisation Quality of Life (WHOQOL)-BREF scores. Data, including the most recent follow-up date of patients and their daily methadone dose, were obtained retrospectively, in 2015. Retention rate was ascertained on the basis of living patients who stayed in the MMT programme up to 2015. Factors predicting retention rate and mortality were ascertained using Cox’s proportional hazards regression analysis. Results:. The retention rate for MMT at its implementation 10 years ago was 70.1%. Methadone dose ? 80 mg/day significantly predicted better retention, while HIV risk-taking behaviour significantly predicted poorer retention in MMT. Mortality was found to be significantly lower among patients of Malay ethnicity and higher among patients who had been found to have HIV and other medical illnesses.

The objective of this study is to identify significant determinants associated with individuals’ intention to undergo CVD health checks. These determinants could be used to develop effective strategies to improve CVD health check participation. Methods This was a cross sectional survey using mall intercept interviews. It was carried out in a hypermarket surrounded by housing estates with a population of varying socioeconomic backgrounds. Inclusion criteria were Malaysian nationality and age 30 years and older. The validated CVD health check questionnaire was used to assess participants’ intention and the determinants that influenced their intention to undergo CVD health checks. Results A total of 413 participants were recruited. The median age of the participants was 45 years (IQR 17 years) and 60% of them were female. Participants indicated they were likely (45.0%) or very likely (38.7%) to undergo CVD health checks while 16.2% were not sure, unlikely or very unlikely to undergo health checks. Using ordinal regression analysis, perception of benefits, drawbacks of CVD health checks, perception of external barriers and readiness to handle outcomes following CVD health checks were the significant determinants of individuals’ intention to undergo CVD health checks. Conclusions To improve individuals’ participation in CVD health checks, we need to develop strategies to address their perception of benefits and drawbacks of CVD health checks, the perceived external barriers and their readiness to handle outcomes following CVD health checks. ? 2018 Cheong et al.

Thus, accurate prognostication is important to avoid harm to these patients with limited lifespan. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the median survival and 30-day mortality (30-DM) and factors associated with these parameters in our centre. Methods: Data from 585 eligible patients who received palliative radiotherapy between January 2012 and December 2014 were analysed. Median overall survival was calculated from the commencement of first fraction of the last course of radiotherapy to date of death or when censored. 30-DM was calculated as the proportion of patients who died within 30 days from treatment start date. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was used to estimate survival. Chi-square test and logistic regression was used to assess the impact of potential prognostic factors on median survival and 30-DM. Results: The most common diagnoses were lung and breast cancers and most common irradiated sites were bone and brain. Median survival and 30-DM were 97 days and 22.7% respectively. Primary cancer, age, treatment course, performance status, systemic treatment post radiotherapy and intended radiotherapy treatment completed had an impact on median survival whereas mainly the latter three factors had an impact on 30-DM. Conclusion: Median survival and factors affecting both survival and 30-DM in our study are comparable to others. However, a 30-DM rate of 22.7% is significantly higher compared to the literature. We need to better select patients who will benefit from palliative radiotherapy in our centre. ? 2018, Malaysian Medical Association.

Of these, granulomatous amoebic encephalitis (GAE), leishmaniasis and malaria are 3 common parasitic diseases which can be fatal if left untreated. The available drugs seem to be ineffective as resistant strains have emerged in recent years. It is timely for medicinal plants have been given much attention as an alternative for the available chemotherapeutic drugs. This review was conducted to evaluate the anti-parasitic effects of medicinal plants from different parts of the world. It was found that large numbers of plants showed strong anti-parasitic potential; Clerodendrum rotundifolium Oliv. leaves water fraction, Clerodendrum rotundifolium Oliv. leaves methanol fraction and Microglossa pyrifolia showed strong anti-malarial activity with IC50 of 0.01, 0.02 and 0.05 ?g/ml in vitro. Limouni olive is a strong amoebicidal agent with IC50 of 5.11 ?g/ml. Ethanol extracts from H. stignocarpa leaves (4.69 ?g/ml), J. cuspidifolia leaves (10.96 ?g/ml) and Jacaranda caroba leaves (13.22 ?g/ml) showed strong activity against Leishmania spp. with IC50 values lower than 25 ?g/ml. In conclusion, these promising results suggest that future research on medicinal plants needs to be done to identify its active constituents, cytotoxicity, effectivity and feasibility to be utilized against infections caused by these parasites. Furthermore, phytochemical investigations should be undertaken to achieve the effectiveness of therapeutic agents particularly in limited resource settings. ? 2018, Walailak University.

The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of expression of leptin (Ob) and its receptor (ObR) in discriminating chRCC from RO. Sections from paraffin-embedded, formalin-fixed tumour nephrectomy specimens of 45 patients, made up of 30 chRCC (15 eosinophilic variant and 15 non-eosinophilic variant) and 15 RO, were used in this study. Samples (30) of clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most common histological subtype, were used to verify staining patterns found by others in our cohort of Australasian patients. Matched morphologically normal non-cancer kidney tissues were included for each specimen. Sections were batch-immunostained using antibodies against Ob and ObR. Stained sections were digitally scanned using Aperio ImageScope, and the expression pattern of Ob and ObR was studied. In this cohort, male to female ratio was 2:1; median age was 64 (45–88 years); and median tumour size was 3.8 cm (range 1.2–18 cm). There were 47 (62.7%) T1, seven T2, 20 T3 and one T4 stage RCC. Two patients with ccRCC presented with metastases. Nuclear expression of Ob was significantly higher in RO compared with chRCC. The increased nuclear expression of Ob in RO compared with chRCC may be a useful aid in the difficult histological differentiation of RO from chRCC, especially eosinophilic variants of chRCC. ? 2018 Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia",chromophobe; immunohistochemistry; kidney; leptin; leptin receptor; oncocytoma; Renal cell carcinoma,"biological marker; leptin; leptin receptor; leptin; tumor marker; adult; aged; Article; cancer diagnosis; clinical article; controlled study; female; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; kidney tumor; male; morphometry; nephrectomy; oncocytoma; priority journal; protein expression; renal cell carcinoma; sex ratio; differential diagnosis; kidney; kidney tumor; metabolism; middle aged; oncocytoma; pathology; procedures; renal cell carcinoma; very elderly; Adenoma, Oxyphilic; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Biomarkers, Tumor; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Kidney; Kidney Neoplasms; Leptin; Male; Middle Aged",2-s2.0-85049316281

The powerfulness of SOM in visualizing, understanding, and exploring the complexity in multivariable data can be used to determine the relationships between the input variables. Thirty healthy Muslim male subjects were recruited in the study. Their electroencephalogram (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG), respiration rate (RSP), and oxygen saturation (SPO2) were continuously recorded using computer-based data acquisition system (MP150, BIOPAC Systems Inc., Camino Goleta, California). Three maps were constructed to determine the correlations in pre-baseline, during Salat, and post-baseline conditions utilizing SOM. The visualized results during Salat indicated that, alpha power (Pα) showed significant positive correlation in the occipital and parietal electrodes with the normalized unit of high-frequency HF (n.u.) power of heart rate variability (HRV) components (as a parasympathetic index), heart rate (HR), and RSP. Significant negative correlation was also observed between Pα with the normalized unit of low-frequency LF (n.u.) power and LF/HF of HRV (as sympathetic indices). SPO2 showed no correlation with Pα. While the results in pre-baseline and post-baseline conditions also did not show any correlation between the variables. The SOM proves that it can be successfully employed as a powerful technique in correlation analysis. The results were presented and compared with a previous study. Thus, it can be applied successfully in various biomedical engineering applications. ? 2018 National Taiwan University.",Alpha power band; Correlation analysis; Electroencephalographic; Muslim prayer (Salat); Self-organizing map,Biomedical engineering; Conformal mapping; Correlation methods; Data acquisition; Electrocardiography; Electrophysiology; Heart; Multivariable systems; Physiological models; Self organizing maps; Alpha power band; Correlation analysis; Data acquisition system; Electro-encephalogram (EEG); Electroencephalographic; Engineering applications; Muslims; Physiological parameters; Electroencephalography; adult; alpha rhythm; Article; artificial neural network; breathing rate; correlation analysis; electrocardiography; electroencephalography; heart rate variability; human; human experiment; information system; male; Muslim; normal human; occipital lobe; oxygen saturation; parasympathetic function; parietal lobe; physiologic monitoring; religion; self organizing map; signal detection; sympathetic function,2-s2.0-85048686370

Two review authors independently selected trials, extracted data, assessed the risks of bias in included trials and graded the quality of evidence. Meta-analyses were conducted for studies presenting similar outcomes. Results: Ten RCTs involving 1164 participants were included. These RCTs varied in terms of patients’ grade of haemorrhoids, length of trials, and outcome assessed. Most of the studies did not describe adequately the process of randomisation and allocation concealment. The pooled analysis of data from three studies indicated that there was significant difference between groups for the bleeding outcome, favoring the MPFF group (RR 1.46; 95% CI 1.10–1.93; p = 0.008). Except for bleeding, the current evidence did not show MPFF has significant effects on all the other outcomes examined when compared with placebo.

Materials and Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of men aged above 40 years with no history of prostate cancer, prostate surgery, or 5α-reductase inhibitor treatment. Serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and total PV were measured in each subject. Potential sociodemographic and clinical variables including age, weight, comorbidities, and International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) were collected. Of 1034 subjects, 837 were used in building the PV calculator using regression analysis. The remaining 1/5 (n = 197) was used for model validation. Results: There were 1034 multiethnic Asian men (Chinese 52.9%, Malay 35.4%, and Indian 11.7%) with mean age of 60 ± 7.6 years. Average PV was 29.4 ± 13.0 mL while the overall mean of PSA was 1.7 ± 1.7 ng/mL. We identified age, IPSS, weight, and PSA (all P &lt;.05) in the PV regression model. Using the validation set, the coefficient of determination (R2) of this PV calculator was 0.47 where PV = 20.6 + (age ? 60) × 0.1 + (IPSS score) × 0.1 + (Weight ? 70) × 0.3 + (history of alpha-blocker treatment for LUTS) × 9.6 + PSA × 3.7.

We examined the relative importance of health-related tasks after release compared to tasks of everyday life among a total sample of 577 drug users incarcerated in Ukraine, Azerbaijan, and Kyrgyzstan. A proxy measure of whether participants identified a task as applicable (easy or hard) versus not applicable was used to determine the importance of each task. Correlates of the importance of health-related reentry tasks were analyzed using logistic regression, with a parsimonious model being derived using Bayesian lasso method. Despite all participants having substance use disorders and high prevalence of comorbidities, participants in all three countries prioritized finding a source of income, reconnecting with family, and staying out of prison over receiving treatment for substance use disorders, general health conditions, and initiating methadone treatment. Participants with poorer general health were more likely to prioritize treatment for substance use disorders. While prior drug injection and opioid agonist treatment (OAT) correlated with any interest in methadone in all countries, only in Ukraine did a small number of participants prioritize getting methadone as the most important post-release task. While community-based OAT is available in all three countries and prison-based OAT only in Kyrgyzstan, Kyrgyz prisoners were less likely to choose help staying off drugs and getting methadone. Overall, prisoners consider methadone treatment inapplicable to their pre-release planning. Future studies that involve patient decision-making and scale-up of OAT within prison settings are needed to better improve individual and public health. ? 2018, The New York Academy of Medicine.",Eastern Europe and Central Asia; HIV; Incarceration; Methadone; Opioid agonist treatment; People who inject drugs; Post-release challenges; Prisoners,adult; Azerbaijan; Bayes theorem; drug use; epidemiology; female; human; Kyrgyzstan; male; middle aged; patient attitude; prevalence; prisoner; psychology; Ukraine; Adult; Azerbaijan; Bayes Theorem; Drug Users; Female; Humans; Kyrgyzstan; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Prevalence; Prisoners; Ukraine,2-s2.0-85046399189

However, if the guidelines do not address all the important components of optimal care sufficiently, the quality and validity of the guidelines can be reduced. The objectives of this study were to systematically review current guidelines for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), evaluate their methodological quality and highlight the similarities and differences in their recommendations for empirical antibiotic and antibiotic de-escalation strategies. Methods: This review is reported in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Electronic databases including MEDLINE, CINAHL, PubMed and EMBASE were searched up to September 2017 for relevant guidelines. Other databases such as NICE, Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) and the websites of professional societies were also searched for relevant guidelines. The quality and reporting of included guidelines were assessed using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE-II) instrument. Results and discussion: Six guidelines were eligible for inclusion in our review. Among 6 domains of AGREE-II, “clarity of presentation” scored the highest (80.6%), whereas “applicability” scored the lowest (11.8%). All the guidelines supported the antibiotic de-escalation strategy, whereas the majority of the guidelines (5 of 6) recommended that empirical antibiotic therapy should be implemented in accordance with local microbiological data. All the guidelines suggested that for early-onset HAP/VAP, therapy should start with a narrow spectrum empirical antibiotic such as penicillin or cephalosporins, whereas for late-onset HAP/VAP, the guidelines recommended the use of a broader spectrum empirical antibiotic such as the penicillin extended spectrum carbapenems and glycopeptides. What is new and Conclusions: Expert guidelines promote the judicious use of antibiotics and prevent antibiotic overuse. The quality and validity of available HAP/VAP guidelines would be enhanced by improving their adherence to accepted best practice for the management of HAP and VAP. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",AGREE-II instrument; antibiotic de-escalation; applicability; empirical antibiotic; ventilator-associated pneumonia,"amikacin; amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid; antibiotic agent; aztreonam; biapenem; carbapenem derivative; cefepime; cefotaxime; ceftriaxone; cefuroxime; cephalosporin derivative; ciprofloxacin; colistin; ertapenem; gentamicin; imipenem; levofloxacin; linezolid; meropenem; moxifloxacin; pazufloxacin; penicillin derivative; piperacillin plus tazobactam; polymyxin B; polypeptide antibiotic agent; quinoline derived antiinfective agent; tobramycin; vancomycin; antiinfective agent; antibiotic therapy; disease course; drug use; hospital acquired pneumonia; human; practice guideline; Review; systematic review; treatment outcome; ventilator associated pneumonia; cross infection; meta analysis; practice guideline; prescription; standards; ventilator associated pneumonia; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Cross Infection; Drug Prescriptions; Humans; Pneumonia, Ventilator-Associated; Practice Guidelines as Topic",2-s2.0-85046378559

The present study sought to investigate the correlation between mtDNA content in lymphocytes and associated clinical risk factors for impaired fasting glucose (IFG). We included 23 healthy control and 42 IFG participants in this cross-sectional study. The measurements of mtDNA content in lymphocytes and pro-inflammatory markers derived from both normal and diseased individuals were quantified. Spearman partial correlation and multivariate statistical analyses were employed to evaluate the association between mtDNA content and other metabolic covariates in IFG. Reduced mtDNA content was observed in the IFG group with microvascular complications than those without complications. The IFG patients with lowest median of mtDNA content had considerably elevated hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and inflammation. The adjusted partial correlation analysis showed that mtDNA content was positively correlated with HDL-cholesterol and IL-10 (P < 0.005 for all). Further, multiple linear regression analyses verified that reduced mtDNA content in lymphocytes was independently associated with HOMA-IR (β = 0.027, P = 0.003), HbA1c (β = 0.652, P = 0.002), HDL-cholesterol (β = ? 1.056, P = 0.021), IL-6 (β = 0.423, P = 0.002), IL-10 (β = ? 1.234, P = 0.043) and TNF-α (β = 0.542, P < 0.001) after adjustment for confounding factors.

RESEARCH DESIGN: Data from two previous qualitative studies, the Front-line Equitable Evidence-based Decision Making in Medicine and Creating, Synthesising and Implementing evidence-based medicine (EBM) in primary care studies, were sorted, arranged, classified and compared with the help of qualitative research software, NVivo V.10. Data categories were interrogated through comparison between and within datasets to identify similarities and differences in rural and urban practices. Themes were then refined by removing or recoding redundant and infrequent nodes into major key themes. PARTICIPANTS: There were 55 primary care physicians who participated in 10 focus group discussions (n=31) and 9 individual physician in-depth interviews. SETTING: The study was conducted across three primary care settings-an academic primary care practice and both private and public health clinics in rural (Pahang) and urban (Selangor and Kuala Lumpur) settings in Malaysia. RESULTS: We identified five major themes that influenced the implementation of EBM according to practice settings, namely, workplace factors, EBM understanding and awareness, work experience and access to specialist placement, availability of resources and patient population. Lack of standardised care is a contributing factor to differences in EBM practice, especially in rural areas. CONCLUSIONS: There were major differences in the practice of EBM between rural and urban primary care settings. These findings could be used by policy-makers, administrators and the physicians themselves to identify strategies to improve EBM practices that are targeted according to workplace settings. ?

This study aimed to explore factors associated with preventive practices of vaginitis among Malaysian women. A cross-sectional computer-assisted telephone interview survey of a representative sample of multi-racial Malaysian women aged 18–50 years old was conducted from January to April 2014. Women from 1446 households responded to the survey and nearly one-third (32.1%) reported to have experienced vaginitis. In multivariate analyses, respondents in the urban locality were more likely to practice vaginitis prevention (OR = 1.40, 95% CI = 1.06–1.84) compared with those in the rural areas. Respondents who perceived low susceptibility to vaginitis were less likely to practice vaginitis prevention (OR = 0.72, 95% CI = 0.57–0.91) compared with responders who highly perceive susceptibility. Respondents who had no formal education were less likely to practice vaginitis prevention (OR = 0.16, 95% CI = 0.05–0.48) compared with those with tertiary education. This study showed that comprehensive education and health programmes need to focus on women with a low educational level, living in rural areas and women with low perceived susceptibility to vaginitis.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Little is known about vaginitis issues among women in Malaysia. This study provides information regarding vaginitis among Malaysian women by looking at the factors associated with prevention practices. What do the results of this study add? From our study, factors associated with prevention practices were found to be educational level, locality, and perceived susceptibility of vaginitis. Those who perform fewer vaginitis prevention practices were women with a low educational level and those who live in rural areas. From the Health Belief Model, women with a low perceived susceptibility of vaginitis were less likely to carry out vaginitis prevention practices. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The findings may provide additional insights for policy makers and healthcare providers to deliver effective approaches in order to improve prevention practices of vaginitis among women in multi-ethnic communities.

However, little is known about the effects of daily pill burden on adherence amongst PLWH who use drugs. We sought to investigate the association between daily pill burden and adherence to ART among members of this key population in Vancouver, Canada. METHODS: We used data from the AIDS Care Cohort to Evaluate Exposure to Survival Services study, a long-running community-recruited cohort of PLWH who use illicit drugs linked to comprehensive HIV clinical records. The longitudinal relationship between daily pill burden and the odds of ?95% adherence to ART among ART-exposed individuals was analyzed using multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects modeling, adjusting for sociodemographic, behavioural, and structural factors linked to adherence. RESULTS: Between December 2005 and May 2014, the study enrolled 770 ART-exposed participants, including 257 (34%) women, with a median age of 43 years. At baseline, 437 (56.7%) participants achieved ?95% adherence in the previous 180 days. Among all interview periods, the median adherence was 100% (interquartile range 71%-100%). In a multivariable model, a greater number of pills per day was negatively associated with ?95% adherence (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.87 per pill, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.84-0.91). Further analysis showed that once-a-day ART regimens were positively associated with optimal adherence (AOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.07-1.80).

The healthcare industry collects a large amount of healthcare information, which contains several patterns, such as outbreaks of diseases. However, this data frequently goes unexploited. Accurate forecasting using this past data could help healthcare managers in taking appropriate decisions especially in implementing preventing measures. Due to the geographical nature of Maldives, it is difficult to implement preventive measures in case of an outbreak. There is no single approach to be used for health forecasting; thus, various methods have been used to specific health conditions or healthcare resources. Healthcare comprises of both complex linear and nonlinear patterns, which can affect the forecasting accuracy if only linear models or neural networks are used.

The placebo-tianeptine difference (SE) was 0.66 (0.15) for Clinical Global Impressions-Severity of Illness (95% CI, 0.37 to 0.96; P&lt; .001) and 0.57 (0.14) for Clinical Global Impressions- Improvement (95% CI, 0.30 to 0.83; P&lt; .001). Positive results were also obtained with the active control escitalopram (HDRS17 total score placebo-escitalopram difference of 4.09 ± 0.86 points, P&lt; .001), therefore validating the sensitivity of the studied population. Tianeptine was well tolerated, with only minimal differences in tolerability from placebo. Conclusions: The present study provides robust evidence that an 8-week treatment period with tianeptine 25-50 mg is efficacious and well tolerated in depressed patients aged 65 years or older. ?

Case Report: We report the case of a 58-year-old woman who presented to us with a chief complaint of recurrent right-sided epistaxis and nasal blockage for the past 4 months, which was progressively worsening. Histopathological examination confirmed the presence of a REAH instead of a sinonasal malignancy. The tumor was surgically excised from the lateral nasal wall using electrocautery under endoscopic guidance. The patient was then carefully followed-up after surgery, and the wound was successfully healed 3 months after the initial surgery. There was no evidence of recurrence 6 months after the initial surgery Conclusion: This case demonstrates the rare presentation of a REAH, which had arisen from the lateral nasal wall. Clinically, it is difficult to distinguish a REAH from a more notorious mass such as a sinonasal malignancy. Therefore, biopsy is mandatory in all cases of lateral nasal mass in order to rule out malignancy before confirming nasal REAH. Fortunately, as seen in this case, a lateral nasal REAH, once diagnosed, can be safely and easily removed from the lateral nasal wall using electrocautery with good surgical outcomes and a low rate of recurrence. ? 2018 Mashhad University of Medical Sciences.",Electrocautery; Endoscope; Hamartoma; Nasal cavity,adult; Article; case report; cauterization; clinical article; diagnostic test; disease exacerbation; endoscopic surgery; epistaxis; female; hamartoma; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; lateral nasal wall respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma; nasal biopsy; nose obstruction; nose tumor; outcome assessment; postoperative period; rare disease; recurrent disease; wound healing,2-s2.0-85049240335

Within universities, there are many types of landscape features exhibiting different heat absorption and transmission capacities. These landscape features generate spatial–temporal heat signatures, and the knowledge about landscape features and urban heat hazard on university campuses is limited. The objective of this research is an assessment of landscape features and the potential heat hazard threats of two urban universities in ASEAN, located in the centre of the equatorial region. The focus of this research is on urban heat hazards in two urban universities in ASEAN, the University of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur and the University of Indonesia in Jakarta, within the context of the spatial–temporal behaviour of urban heat and the urban heat effects on the environment and human well-being on campuses. The spatial and temporal analysis used to answer the objective of this research via data-gathering methods from image satellite, ground trough, and human perception study. The UM campus and UI campus, both urban campuses, had similar landscape features but had different total percentage areas of these features. The UM campus was 59.1% covered by the densely vegetated surface landscape feature, a percentage lower than that of the UI campus, which was 65.3% vegetation covered. The temporal results for the UHS of the UM campus in 2013–2016 show a maximum temperature of 39?°C. Therefore, the UHS of the UI campus demonstrated temporal behaviour in 2013–2016, with a maximum temperature of 38?°C. The UHS behaviour of the UM campus and UI campus had an air surface temperature with a maximum average temperature of 33?°C. The air surface temperatures exceeding 32?°C at the UM campus (12?pm until 6?pm = 5?h) lasted for a longer time than those at the UI campus (12?pm until 3?pm = 3?h). This study showed that, based on the perceptions on both campuses, if temperatures exceeded 30?°C, respondents were very hot and very uncomfortable, which will impact health and decrease work or academic achievements, as perceptions of heat intensity impact human well-being. Students perceived that heat intensity impacted their health and they reported becoming tired and lethargic under maximum temperatures and were very hot and very uncomfortable, and this condition impacted their work activity. These results indicated that, at both the UM and UI campuses, heat intensity impacts human well-being, with risks associated with hot temperatures. These two urban campuses are significant for ASEAN university awareness of the urban heat hazard of the equatorial area. ? 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",Effect on environment; Impact on human; Landscape feature; Spatial and temporal analysis; Urban heat intensity,hazard assessment; heat island; landscape; spatial analysis; surface temperature; temporal analysis; urban area; Indonesia; Jakarta; Kuala Lumpur [West Malaysia]; Malaysia; West Malaysia,2-s2.0-85047862330

Objective: The present study was undertaken to determine the association of high temperature requirement A-1 (HTRA1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and very-low-density receptor (VLDR) genes with wet AMD subjects in Malaysia. Methods: A total of 125 subjects with wet AMD and 120 subjects without AMD from the Malaysian population were selected for this study. Genomic DNA was extracted and copy number variations (CNVs) were determined using quantitative real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR) and comparison between the two groups was done. The demographic characteristics were also recorded. Statistical analysis was carried out using software where a level of P < 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. Result: Statistically significant associations of the VEGF gene were observed in mean copy differences between case and control subjects (P < 0.05). The consistency of both unadjusted and age-adjusted data at Copy Number CN gain (CN = 3 and CN = 4) suggested that VEGF could increase the risk of wet AMD disease (P < 0.05). None of CNVs of HTRA1 and VLDR genes showed associations with the wet AMD disease based on comparisons of the frequencies of mean (P > 0.05). Conclusion: Observations of an association between CNVs of VEGF gene and wet AMD have revealed that the CNVs of VEGF gene appears to be a possible contributor to wet AMD subjects in Malaysia. ? 2017 Ain Shams University",Age-related macular degeneration; Copy number variations; HTRA1; VEGF; VLDR genes and Malaysia,genomic DNA; serine protease HTRA1; vasculotropin; very low density lipoprotein receptor; age related macular degeneration; aged; Article; controlled study; copy number variation; female; gene frequency; genetic polymorphism; genetic risk; genetic susceptibility; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; pathogenesis; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; wet macular degeneration,2-s2.0-85029866550

However, social and demographic inequalities in accessing health care services exist in both developed and developing countries. This study examined the demographic and socio-economic factors associated with the lack of access to public clinics in the Greater Kuala Lumpur area. Materials and Methods: The study employed a survey involving 1032 participants. Data were collected using self-administered questionnaires distributed between October and December 2015 in the Greater Kuala Lumpur area. Results: Of the 1032 participants, 535 were public clinic users. A quarter (25.8%) of the users stated that they did not have access to public clinics in their residential area. A multiple logistic analysis showed that the elderly, the women, those from ethnic minority groups, those of lower family income, and the private sector workers were more likely not to have access to public clinics than their counterparts. Conclusions: The existing level of accessibility to public clinics could be improved by increasing the number of clinics. Clinics should be established to focus more on reaching the elderly, the women, the ethnic minority groups, the poorer families, and the private sector employees. ? 2018, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.

It is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prognostic factors affecting the survival of patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas in Malaysia. Methods: This retrospective study examined 107 patients with adenocarcinoma of the pancreas from 2002 to 2012 at University Malaya Medical Centre. The factors evaluated were age, sex, race, smoking habits, performance status, the presence of jaundice, pre-treatment CA 19.9 serum level, the location of a primary tumour, tumour grade, tumour staging and intent of treatment. Results: The median survival for the overall study population was 7.0 months (95% CI 5.1-8.8 months) with 1, 3, and 5-year survival rates of 30.8%, 8.4% and 3.7% respectively. The survival was 16.1 months (95% CI 7.7-24.4 months) for stage 1, 15.5 months (95% CI 8.1-22.8 months) for stage 2, 8.4 months (95% CI 6.1-10.8 months) for stage 3, and 3.8 months (95% CI 2.9-4.7 months) for stage 4. In multivariate analysis, independent and unfavourable prognostic factors which retained significance were performance status, tumour stage and treatment intent. Conclusions: The biological characteristics are important as predictors of survival in patients with pancreatic cancer. Longer survival is possible if the disease is identified in its early stages with good performance status. Further development and evaluation of novel screening strategies need to be established to improve early detection of this disease. ? 2018, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya.

However, there is a lack of validated instruments to assess the knowledge, practice and barriers of primary care physicians in the implementation of EBM. This study aimed to develop and validate an Evidence-Based Medicine Questionnaire (EBMQ) in Malaysia. Methods: The EBMQ was developed based on a qualitative study, literature review and an expert panel. Face and content validity was verified by the expert panel and piloted among 10 participants. Primary care physicians with or without EBM training who could understand English were recruited from December 2015 to January 2016. The EBMQ was administered at baseline and two weeks later. A higher score indicates better knowledge, better practice of EBM and less barriers towards the implementation of EBM. We hypothesized that the EBMQ would have three domains: knowledge, practice and barriers. Results: The final version of the EBMQ consists of 80 items: 62 items were measured on a nominal scale, 22 items were measured on a 5 point Likert-scale. Flesch reading ease was 61.2. A total of 343 participants were approached; of whom 320 agreed to participate (response rate = 93.2%). Factor analysis revealed that the EBMQ had eight domains after 13 items were removed: ""EBM websites"", ""evidence-based journals"", ""types of studies"", ""terms related to EBM"", ""practice"", ""access"", ""patient preferences"" and ""support"". Cronbach alpha for the overall EBMQ was 0.909, whilst the Cronbach alpha for the individual domain ranged from 0.657-0.940. The EBMQ was able to discriminate between doctors with and without EBM training for 24 out of 42 items. At test-retest, kappa values ranged from 0.155 to 0.620.

There are only limited data available regarding HPV-related OPSCC in Asian countries and no data from Malaysia. Methods: We identified 60 Malaysian patients with OPSCC over a 12-year period (2004-2015) from four different hospitals in two major cities, Kuala Lumpur and Penang. The detection of HPV was carried out using p16 immunohistochemistry and high risk HPV DNA in situ hybridisation. Results: Overall, 15 (25%) tumours were p16 positive by immunohistochemistry, 10 of which were also positive for high risk HPV DNA by in situ hybridisation. By comparison, a matched cohort of UK patients had a p16 positive rate of 49%. However, between 2009 and 2015, where cases were available from all four hospitals, 13 of 37 (35%) cases were p16 positive. In our Malaysian cohort, 53% of patients were of Chinese ethnicity and 80% of the p16 positive cases were found in these patients; no Indian patients had p16 positive disease, despite representing 35% of the total cohort. Conclusion: The proportion of OPSCCs associated with HPV in Malaysia appears to be lower than in European and American cohorts and could possibly be more prevalent amongst Malaysians of Chinese ethnicity. Further, our data suggests that the burden of HPV-related OPSCC could be increasing in Malaysia. Larger cross-sectional studies of Malaysian patients are required to determine the public health implications of these preliminary findings. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Human papillomavirus; Malaysia; Oropharyngeal; p16; Squamous cell carcinoma,protein p16; virus DNA; adult; aged; Article; cancer patient; Chinese; clinical feature; cohort analysis; controlled study; ethnicity; female; high risk patient; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; major clinical study; Malaysia; Malaysian; male; middle aged; oropharynx squamous cell carcinoma; papillomavirus infection; priority journal; very elderly,2-s2.0-85048443869

This study aims to assess Malaysian dental students' tobacco use, exposure to second-hand smoke and their attitude towards tobacco control activities and curriculum. This was a cross-sectional study using a self-administered questionnaire adapted from the Global Health Professions Students Survey (GHPSS). The questionnaire was distributed to all Malaysian fourth and fifth year dental students in four public dental schools (n=372), namely University of Malaya (UM), Universiti Teknologi Mara (UiTM), Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) and Universiti Sains Islam Malaysia (USIM). The data were analysed using descriptive and chi square tests. In total, (n=349) respondents completed the questionnaire, yielding a 93.8% response rate. Although the prevalence of Malaysian dental students who 'ever smoked' was 21.2%, the prevalence of current smokers was low (2.3%). About 62% and 39% of students reported having been exposed to second-hand smoke in public and at home, respectively. USIM students were significantly less likely to recall having received training about approaches to smoking cessation (52.9%, p < 0.001). Significantly fewer smokers than non-smokers agreed on tobacco banning policy. Regardless of their smoking status, the majority of dental students showed positive attitudes towards dentists' role in tobacco cessation. Tobacco user among Malaysian dental students was low. There were statistically significant differences between ever smokers and non-smokers' attitudes towards tobacco banning policy. The majority of dental students showed positive attitudes towards dentists' role in tobacco cessation. ?

This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of Microsporidia among a various group of immunocompromised patient. Two hundred and eighty-eight archived stool samples were examined for the presence of Microsporidia with Gram-Chromotrope Kinyoun staining method. The overall prevalence of Microsporidia was 29.2 % (84/288; 95% CI=24.2-34.5). The end-stage renal failure (ESRF) patients (32.1%) recorded the highest infection rate, followed by cancer (26.2%), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV/AIDS) (22.6%) and acute gastroenteritis (AGE) (7.1%). Meanwhile, organ transplant recipients and autoimmune disease patients recorded the lowest prevalence rate (6.0%). Other intestinal parasites were Strongyloides stercoralis, Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides and Cryptosporidium species. Diarrhoea was the most common symptoms among patients with microsporidiosis. The present study showed that the prevalence of Microsporidia infection was relatively high among immunocompromised patients. This finding highlighted the importance to include detection of microsporidia infection as a routine differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients, which serves the benefit of treatment to the patients. ? 2018, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted among outpatients with regular NSAID usage. The presence of dyspepsia was assessed by locally validated versions of the Leeds dyspepsia questionnaire (LDQ), GPA and the participants' adherence to the drugs were assessed at recruitment and 2 weeks later. GPA was defined as the use of antisecretory medications or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors. RESULTS: Initially, 409 participants (mean age 52.3 ± 14.6 years, 60.6% females, 48.4% treated for musculoskeletal pain) were recruited. At recruitment, 50.9% of the participants had at least one upper gastrointestinal symptom. Complete data for follow-up analysis were collected from 158 participants who were naive NSAID users, had no prior gastrointestinal medication and who could be contacted. At 2-week follow-up there was no significant difference in the LDQ score change between NSAID users treated with GPA and those did not. However, there was a greater reduction in abdominal pain/discomfort (8.8% vs 5.0%, P < 0.001) and burping (8.8% vs 4.0%, P < 0.001) among participants using GPA compared with those who were not. Adherence to GPA was poor, with study participants citing the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms as their main reason for non-adherence. CONCLUSIONS: The use of GPA in patients on regular NSAIDs does not improve their overall dyspepsia, but it reduces abdominal pain and burping. Poor adherence to GPA may be a contributing factor. ? 2018 Chinese Medical Association Shanghai Branch, Chinese Society of Gastroenterology, Renji Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai Jiaotong University School of Medicine and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",anti-ulcer agents; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitors; dyspepsia; non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents; proton pump inhibitors,"antacid agent; celecoxib; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor; diclofenac; etoricoxib; gastrointestinal mucosa protective agent; histamine H2 receptor antagonist; indometacin; mefenamic acid; melartin; meloxicam; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; proton pump inhibitor; antiulcer agent; cyclooxygenase 2 inhibitor; histamine H2 receptor antagonist; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; proton pump inhibitor; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; dyspepsia; female; follow up; gastrointestinal symptom; human; longitudinal study; major clinical study; male; musculoskeletal pain; patient compliance; priority journal; prophylaxis; prospective study; treatment refusal; chemically induced; chemoprophylaxis; drug administration; dyspepsia; medication compliance; middle aged; statistics and numerical data; very elderly; young adult; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Anti-Ulcer Agents; Chemoprevention; Cyclooxygenase 2 Inhibitors; Drug Administration Schedule; Dyspepsia; Female; Histamine H2 Antagonists; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Medication Adherence; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Proton Pump Inhibitors; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85050010126

Methods: This is a cross-sectional study of all the children of HBsAg-positive mothers who delivered at the University of Malaya Medical Centre between 1993 and 2000. Results: A total of 60 HBsAg-positive mothers and their 154 children participated in the study. HBsAg was detected in four children (2.6%) while IgG antibody to the hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc IgG) was detected in seventeen children (11.0%). The mother’s age at childbirth was significantly lower in the children with detectable HBsAg (22.5±6.1 years vs. 29.7±4.5 years, p=0.043) and anti-HBc IgG (26.6±6.1 years vs. 30.0±4.3 years, p=0.004).

All children with detectable HBsAg were born via spontaneous vaginal delivery, and hepatitis B immunoglobulin was either not given or the administration status was unknown. The majority of mothers with chronic HBV infection (70.4%) were not under any regular follow-up for their chronic HBV infection and the main reason was the lack of awareness of the need to do so (47.4%). Conclusion: Transmission of HBV infection among children of HBsAg-positive mothers in Malaysia is low. However, attention needs to be given to the high rate of HBsAg-positive mothers who are not on any regular follow-up. ? 2018, Malaysian Medical Association.

To reduce global cardiovascular (CV) risk in the population, primary preventive strategies need to be implemented. Hypercholesterolaemia is one of the major risk factors for CVD. This paper is an expert review on the management of hypercholesterolemia focusing on high and very high risk individuals. In low and Intermediate risk individuals, therapeutic lifestyle changes (TLC) and a healthy lifestyle alone may suffice. In high and very high risk individuals, drug therapy in conjunction with TLC are necessary to achieve the target LDL-C levels which have been shown to slow down progression and sometimes even result in regression of atherosclerotic plaques. Statins are first-line drugs because they have been shown in numerous randomized controlled trials to be effective in reducing CV events and to be safe. In some high risk individuals, despite maximally tolerated statin therapy, target Low Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels are not achieved. These include those with familial hypercholesterolaemia and statin intolerance.

The extract was subjected to oral glucose tolerance test in normal and alloxan induced diabetic mice to explore its antihyperglycemic activity. Antioxidant capacity was analyzed by a number of in vitro assays. Quantification of bioactive polyphenols was done by HPLC. Liquid Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (LCMS) was used to identify chemical constituents present in the extract. Total polyphenol and flavonoids content were found in significant quantity. In DPPH radical scavenging assay the IC50 value of the extract was found to be 148.62??g/mL. Reducing power of the extract was comparable with that of butylatedhydroxytoluene (BHT). HPLC analysis indicated that quercetin, rutin, p-coumaric acid and kaempferol were the major bioactive polyphenols present in the extract. Further chemical profiling using LCMS analysis was identified a total of nine compounds with different chemical classes.

Aim: To assess if the risks of renal impairment were similar in treatment-na?ve compared to treatment-experienced patients initiating tenofovir given their different background clinical characteristics. Method: This was a retrospective observational study conducted at the University Malaya Medical Centre, Malaysia and included all HIV-infected adults who received tenofovir for at least 3?months and had an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) >60?mL/min at tenofovir initiation. The incidence of renal impairment was defined as a 25% decrease in eGFR from baseline or the development of chronic kidney disease. Clinical and demographic characteristics were extracted from medical records. Risk factors associated with tenofovir-induced renal impairment were determined using multivariate logistic regression. Results: This study included 314 patients and almost half of them (49%) were treatment-na?ve at tenofovir initiation. The majority of patients were male (89.5%) with a median (interquartile range) baseline creatinine clearance of 99.1?mL/min (85.0–114.0). Thirty (9.4%) patients developed tenofovir-induced renal impairment and the incidence rate was higher in treatment-experienced versus treatment-na?ve patients (7.0 vs 3.3 cases/100 person-years, p?=?0.049). Risk factors associated with tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity in multivariate analysis were older age (p?=?0.001), anaemia (p?=?0.027), concurrent hypertension (p?=?0.014) and higher baseline eGFR (p?=?0.007). Conclusion: Treatment experience was not an independent risk factor but was rather confounded by multiple characteristics associated with an increased risk of TDF-induced nephrotoxicity.

Methods: This multi-centre, international, single-arm, prospective observational study aimed at demonstrating the non-inferiority of a mid-term absorbable monofilament in comparison to braided sutures in gastrointestinal anastomosis. Monosyn suture was used to create the gastrointestinal anastomosis and the frequency of anastomotic leakage until day of discharge was chosen as the primary parameter. The outcome was compared to the results published for braided sutures in the literature. Secondary parameters were the time to perform the anastomosis, length of hospital stay, costs, and postoperative complications. Results: The anastomosis leakage rate was 2.91%, indicating that Monosyn suture was not inferior to braided sutures used in gastrointestinal anastomosis. Of the reported anastomotic suture techniques, the single layer continuous method was the fastest and most economical technique in the present observational study. Conclusion: Monosyn suture is safe and effective in gastrointestinal anastomosis and represents a good alternative to other sutures used for gastrointestinal anastomosis. With regard to safety, time and cost-efficiency, the single-layer continuous technique should be considered a preferred method.

Improving health care providers' awareness and understanding of the benefits and risks of statin treatment could be of assistance in optimizing the statin prescribing process. Aims and Objectives: This study aimed to assess health care providers' knowledge related to statin therapy and the impact of educational outreach intervention based on the perceived knowledge. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study based on educational outreach intervention targeting physicians and pharmacists in 1 major tertiary hospital in the state of Pahang, Malaysia. Participants responded to a 12-item, validated questionnaire both prior to and after the outreach educational program. Two sessions were conducted separately for 2 cohorts of pharmacists and physicians. The knowledge scores prior to and after the educational intervention were calculated and compared using a paired-samples t-test. Results: The response rate to both pre-and post-educational outreach questionnaires was 91% (40/44). Prior to the intervention, around 84% (n37) of the participants decided to initiate statin therapy for both pre-assessment clinical case scenarios; however, only 27% (n12) could state the clinical benefits of statin therapy. Forty-five percent (n20) could state the drug to drug interactions, and 52.3% (n23) could identify the statin therapy that can be given at any time day/evening. The educational outreach program increased participants' knowledge scores of 1.450 (95% CI, 0.918 to 1.982) point, P?<.0005, which is statistically significant. Forty respondents (91%) were of the opinion that statin side effects are the most common cause of treatment discontinuation. Conclusion: This work demonstrated the impact of an educational outreach intervention on improving health care providers' knowledge and beliefs about statin therapy. This type of intervention is considered effective for short-term knowledge enhancement. Further research is needed to test the long-term efficacy of such intervention. ? 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",knowledge; Malaysia; prescribing; statin therapy; type 2 diabetes mellitus,"hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; hydroxymethylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor; Article; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; evidence based practice; female; health education; health personnel attitude; health program; human; Malaysia; Malaysian; male; medical education; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; pharmacist attitude; physician attitude; practice guideline; prescription; priority journal; risk benefit analysis; tertiary care center; attitude to health; education; evaluation study; health care personnel; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; program evaluation; questionnaire; Cross-Sectional Studies; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Personnel; Humans; Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; Malaysia; Male; Program Evaluation; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85043326041

Though the literature on fertility has clearly delineated the importance of income, female labor force participation and infant mortality as key determinants of fertility rates (FRs), the empirical findings from previous studies remains at best mixed. This study therefore identifies the determinants of female fertility for the countries, namely Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand (ASEAN-5 countries), spanning the period 1980-2010. Using the Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) cointegration and causality techniques, the main findings of the study are summarized as follows: First, a long-run (LR) stable relationship is evident between female fertility, female labor force participation, income and infant mortality for ASEAN-5. Second, there is a deviation of FRs from the short-run (SR) to the LR equilibrium for ASEAN-5, with the highest and lowest speed of adjustment recorded for Malaysia and Thailand, respectively. Third, FR and economic stability are found to be complementary in the LR for ASEAN-5. When the joint LR and SR causalities are considered, we found that female labor force participation, income and infant mortality have dynamic relationships with FR for all the five ASEAN countries. ? 2018 World Scientific Publishing Company.",ARDL bounds test; ASEAN-5; causality; Female fertility; female labor force participation,ASEAN; cointegration analysis; fertility; income; infant mortality; labor participation; Indonesia; Malaysia; Philippines; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Thailand,2-s2.0-84940757526

This study sought to identify plasma miRNAs that are differentially expressed in young ACS patients (mean age of 38.5 ± 4.3 years) and evaluate their diagnostic potentials. Small RNA sequencing (sRNA-seq) was used to profile plasma miRNAs. Discriminatory power of the miRNAs was determined using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Thirteen up-regulated and 16 down-regulated miRNAs were identified in young ACS patients. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) validation showed miR-183-5p was significantly up-regulated (8-fold) in ACS patients with non-ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) whereas miR-134-5p, miR-15a-5p, and let-7i-5p were significantly down-regulated (5-fold, 7-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively) in patients with ST-segment elevated myocardial infarction (STEMI), compared to the healthy controls. MiR-183-5p had a high discriminatory power to differentiate NSTEMI patients from healthy controls (area under the curve (AUC) of ROC = 0.917). The discriminatory power for STEMI patients was highest with let-7i-5p (AUC = 0.833) followed by miR-134-5p and miR-15a-5p and this further improved (AUC = 0.935) with the three miRNAs combination. Plasma miR-183-5p, miR-134-5p, miR-15a-5p and let-7i-5p are deregulated in STEMI and NSTEMI and could be potentially used to discriminate the two ACS forms. ? 2018 by the authors.

Dengue case patterns can be learned using prediction models based on feedback (lagged terms). However, the question whether air quality affects dengue cases is still not thoroughly investigated based on such feedback models. This work developed dengue prediction models using the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and ARIMA with an exogeneous variable (ARIMAX) time series methodologies with API as the exogeneous variable. The Box Jenkins (BJ) approach based on maximum likelihood was used for analysis as it gives effective model estimates and prediction. Three stages of model comparison were carried out for each zone: first with ARIMA models without API, then ARIMAX models with API data from the API station for that zone and finally, ARIMAX models with API data from the zone and spatially neighbouring zones. Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) gives goodness-of-fit versus parsimony comparisons between all elicited models. Our study found that ARIMA models, with the lowest BIC value, outperformed the rest in all five zones. The BIC values for the zone of Kuala Selangor were –800.66, – 796.22, and –790.5229, respectively, for ARIMA only, ARIMAX with single API component and ARIMAX with API components from its zone and spatially neighbouring zones. Therefore, we concluded that API levels, either temporally for each zone or spatio-temporally based on neighbouring zones, do not have a significant effect on dengue cases. ? L.

The study is to clarify whether the human papillomavirus (HPV) is associated with esophageal cancer in Malaysians as there has been no report to date on this in Malaysians and other South East Asians. METHODS: Altogether 67 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas histologically diagnosed between 1 January 2004 and 31 December 2014 at the Department of Pathology, University of Malaya Medical Center, Malaysia were considered for HPV analysis using two commercially available methods, polymerase chain reaction with flow-through hybridization (21 HPV GenoArray Diagnostic Kit) and multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (Anyplex II HPV28 Detection). The DNA amplifiability of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor was checked by amplification of a 268 bp segment of the human β-globin gene (GH20/PC04) prior to HPV detection. RESULTS: HPV detection was finally carried out in 51 patients. HPV16 was detected in the moderately differentiated, stage IV lower esophageal tumor of a 32-year-old Malaysian-born Chinese woman by both methods. Except for a predilection for Indians, the clinical characteristics of esophageal squamous cell carcinomas in this Malaysian cohort were generally similar to those of other populations.

Methods: A retrospective, multi-centre, cohort study of rheumatology patients on long-term NSAIDs was conducted. Clinical data of patients treated between 2010 and 2013 were collected for a 24-month follow-up period. The costs of managing upper GI adverse events were based on patient level resource use data. Results: Six hundred and thirty-four patients met the inclusion criteria: mean age 53.4?years, 89.9% female, diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA; 59.3%), osteoarthritis (OA; 10.3%) and both RA and OA (30.3%). Three hundred and seventy-one (58.5%) patients were prescribed non-selective NSAIDs and 263 (41.5%) had cyclo-oxygenase-2 inhibitors. Eighty-four upper GI adverse events occurred, translating into a risk of 13.2% and an incidence rate of 66.2 per 1000 person-years. GI adverse events comprised: dyspepsia n?=?78 (12.3%), peptic ulcer disease (PUD) n?=?5 (0.79%) and upper GI bleeding (UGIB) n?=?1 (0.16%).

Method: This was a cross-sectional study from the MELoR study consisting of a representative group of 1011 community-dwelling older persons (57% female), mean age 86.5 (54–94) years; 313 were Malays, 367 Chinese and 330 Indians. Participants were asked if they had knee pain. Levels of serum 25-hydroxy cholecalciferol (25-[OH]D), an indicator of vitamin D status, were measured using routine laboratory techniques. Results: In unadjusted analysis, presence of knee pain was significantly associated with vitamin D deficiency (odds ratio [OR] 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.08–1.85, P 0.011). Vitamin D levels were significantly associated with ethnicity differences where Malays (OR 7.08; 95% CI 4.94–10.15) and Indians (OR 6.10; 95% CI 4.28–9.71) have lower levels of vitamin D compared to Chinese. Subsequent multivariate analysis revealed that the association between vitamin D deficiency and knee pain was confounded by ethnic differences. Conclusion: A previous study suggested that vitamin D deficiency was associated with knee pain. This relationship was reproduced in our study, but we further established that the association was explained by ethnic variations. As vitamin D status is dependent on skin tone, diet and sunlight exposure, which are all effected by ethnicity, future studies are now required to determine whether a true relationship exists between vitamin D and knee pain. ? 2018 Asia Pacific League of Associations for Rheumatology and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd",aged; Asia; ethnic differences; knee pain; osteoarthritis; vitamin D deficiency,"calcifediol; vitamin D; biological marker; calcifediol; adult; aged; Article; Chinese; climate; community sample; controlled study; cross-sectional study; diet; disease association; ethnic difference; ethnicity; female; human; Indian; knee pain; laboratory technique; longitudinal study; major clinical study; Malay (people); male; middle income country; nutritional status; priority journal; reproducibility; skin color; Southeast Asian; sun exposure; vitamin blood level; vitamin D deficiency; arthralgia; Asian continental ancestry group; blood; chi square distribution; epidemiology; ethnology; Malaysia; middle aged; multivariate analysis; odds ratio; pain measurement; risk factor; statistical model; very elderly; vitamin D deficiency; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arthralgia; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Biomarkers; Calcifediol; Chi-Square Distribution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Longitudinal Studies; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Odds Ratio; Pain Measurement; Risk Factors; Vitamin D Deficiency",2-s2.0-85047925305

Present study investigated the interaction between PPAR-γ and alpha adrenoceptors in modulating vasopressor responses to Angiotensin II (Ang II) and adrenergic agonists, in diabetic & non-diabetic Spontaneously Hypertensive Rats (SHRs). Diabetes was induced with an i.p injection of streptozotocin (40 mg/kg) in two groups (STZ-CON, STZ-PIO), whereas two groups remained non diabetic (ND-CO, ND-PIO). One diabetic and non-diabetic group received Pioglitazone (10mg/kg) orally for 21 days. On day 28, the animals were anaesthetized with sodium pentobarbitone (60mg/kg) and prepared for measurement of systemic haemodynamics. Basal mean arterial pressure of STZ-CON was higher than ND-CON, whereas following pioglitazone treatment, MAP was lower compared to respective controls. MAP responses to i.v administration of NA, PE, ME and ANG II were significantly lower in diabetic SHRs: STZ-CON vs ND-CON (35%).

Unfortunately, water supply quality monitoring from public water treatment plants (WTPs) is often neglected or taken for granted. To determine the produced water quality, WTPs in Sarawak, Malaysia were assessed for their protozoa removal ability. A selfadministered questionnaire based on the regulations in the Drinking-water Standards for New Zealand (DWSNZ) was developed. Optional 10-liter raw water samples were collected from willing WTPs for the detection of protozoan cysts. Routine physical and microbial testing of WTP parameters were also requested for raw water quality overview. Two of the nine assessed WTPs achieved three log credits in the treatment component, one of which belonged to Peninsular Malaysia. No log credits were obtained in the other tested components for any samples. Most of the WTPs employed ""Coagulation, Sedimentation, and Filtration"" using rapid gravity filters without enhancement (P < 0.05). Giardia cysts were detected in raw water sources used for treatment, and the geographical location was identified as an influencing factor for raw water quality. There is an urgent requirement for active collaboration and holistic approaches to review existing water management policies and interventions. WTPs in Sarawak did not achieve the log credits required to safeguard the microbial quality of the water supplied; however, only Giardia cysts were detected in 10-liter raw water samples despite routine microbial parameter monitoring showing disturbing contamination levels. ? 2017, Nagoya University.",Log removal; Protozoa; Risk assessment; Water Safety Plan; Water treatment,,2-s2.0-85047459907

The aims of this study were (i) to develop a test battery comprising adapted and new scales to evaluate values, attitudes and intentions of dental students towards people with disability and people in marginalised groups and (ii) to determine reliability (interitem consistency) and validity of the scales within the test battery. Materials and Methods: A literature search identified pre-existing measures and models for the assessment of attitudes in healthcare students. Adaptation of three pre-existing scales was undertaken, and a new scale was developed based upon the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) using an elicitation survey. These scales underwent a process of content validation. The three adapted scales and the TPB scale were piloted by 130 students at 5 different professional stages, from 4 different countries. Results: The scales were adjusted to ensure good internal reliability, variance, distribution, and face and content validity. In addition, the different scales showed good divergent validity. Discussion: These results are positive, and the scales now need to be validated in the field. Conclusions: It is hoped that these tools will be useful to educators in SCD to evaluate the impact of teaching and clinical exposure on their students. ? 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

Although uptake of CRRM in Asia appears low, the trends may rise, and there is currently an urgent need to provide evidence for informed decision-making in clinical practice. This study aims to determine the risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) and its associated factors in an Asian setting. Method: A total of 2937 newly diagnosed patients with stage I and stage II breast cancer in University Malaya Medical Centre between Jan 1993 to Dec 2012 were included in the study. Multinomial logistic regression analysis allowing death to compete with CBC as a study outcome was used; patients with unilateral breast cancer who were alive were taken as reference. A stepwise backward regression analysis including age at diagnosis, ethnicity, family history of breast cancer, TNM stage, hormonal receptor status, HER2 status, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy was conducted. Results: Fifty women developed CBC, over a median follow-up of 6?years. The 5- and 10-year cumulative risk of contralateral breast cancer was 1.0% (95% CI 0.6–1.4%) and 2.8% (95% CI 2.0–3.6%), respectively. Young age at diagnosis of first cancer, positive family history, and stage I disease were independent predictors of CBC. Discussion: The current study suggests that the risk of CBC is very low in a Southeast Asian setting. Any recommendations or practice of CRRM should be reviewed with caution and patients must be counseled appropriately. ? 2017, Soci?t?

Methods: We examined whether (a) PA and (b) selected nsSNPs are associated with adiposity parameters and whether PA interacts with these nsSNPs on these outcomes in adolescents from the Malaysian Health and Adolescents Longitudinal Research Team study (n = 1,151). Body mass indices, waist-hip ratio, and percentage body fat (% BF) were obtained. PA was assessed using Physical Activity Questionnaire for Older Children (PAQ-C). Five nsSNPs were included: beta-3 adrenergic receptor (ADRB3) rs4994, FABP2 rs1799883, GHRL rs696217, MC3R rs3827103, and vitamin D receptor rs2228570, individually and as combined genetic risk score (GRS). Associations and interactions between nsSNPs and PAQ-C scores were examined using generalized linear model. Results: PAQ-C scores were associated with % BF (β = -0.44 [95% confidence interval -0.72, -0.16], p = 0.002).

The aims of this study are: to compare the level of trace elements in sera of patients infected with HBV and healthy participants, and to evaluate the efficiency of analytical techniques (e.g. Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass spectrometry (ICP-MS), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (hydride generation) (AAS) and Graphite Furnace Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (GFAAS) that are currently used to detect Fe and Se elements in Patients' human sera. The findings of this study show that the concentration range of copper element between (132.80±28.64 μg/dl) to (105.66±23.20 μg/dl) was significantly higher in HBV infected patients as compared to those in healthy controls (91.27±9.20 μg/dl). Iron concentration range between (206.64±61.60 μg/l) to (170.00±36.71 μg/l) was significantly higher in HBV infected patients as compared to those in healthy controls (158.00±15.13 μg/l). However, patients with HBV had significantly lower serum concentrations of zinc with a concentration range between (111.64±20.90 μg/dl) to (99.25±24.06 μg/dl) as compared to those in healthy controls (113.44±16.38 μg/dl). While selenium concentration range between (64.39±7.39 μg/l) to (51.10±4.96 μg/l) was significantly lower in HBV infected patients as compared to those in healthy controls (67.68±7.60) (μg/l). Moreover, the results of this study suggest that (AAS) technique was the most accurate method to measure the concentration of selenium element, while (UV and ICP-MS) analytical techniques have the same efficiency in measuring the iron concentration. ? 2018 Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85045741617

To assess Malaysian dentists’ perceptions of their mental well-being. Methods. A self-administered questionnaire was developed based on a conceptual framework of mental health and well-being model. Two aspects were assessed, namely the physiological (two domains) and the psychological (six domains). Participants were asked to rate their experiences of the aforementioned aspects using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from all the time to never. Results. The response rate was 81%. Most of the dentists (61.7%) perceived having positive mental well-being. Under the physiological aspect, most respondents reported that they were ‘generally happy’ (93.3%), but about 30% stated they were ‘stressed physically and emotionally’. Of the six domains under the psychological aspect, positive well-being was observed in the ‘sense of coherence’ and ‘behavioural stress’ domains. Participants who were above 40 years old, married and had children reported having a more positive mental well-being when compared with their counterparts. Conclusion. Overall, most Malaysian dentists perceived having a positive mental well-being. It is crucial, however, to closely monitor and initiate early interventions for those with negative symptoms to ensure the safe practice of dentistry. ? 2016 Central Institute for Labour Protection–National Research Institute (CIOP-PIB).",burnout; dentists; mental health; mental well-being; stress,"adult; cross-sectional study; dentist; epidemiology; female; human; job stress; Malaysia; male; mental health; mental stress; occupational health; physiological stress; psychology; questionnaire; self concept; statistics and numerical data; Adult; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dentists; Female; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Mental Health; Occupational Health; Occupational Stress; Self Concept; Stress, Physiological; Stress, Psychological; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85008613366

The availability of standard plasma VL testing in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and access to this testing, are limited by the need to use fresh plasma. Good specimen collection methods for HIV VL testing that are applicable to resource-constrained settings are needed. We assessed the diagnostic performance of the filtered dried plasma spot (FDPS), created using the newly developed, instrument-free VLPlasma device, in identifying treatment failure at a VL threshold of 1,000 copies/ml in fresh plasma. Performance was compared with that of the conventional dried blood spot (DBS). Venous blood samples from 201 people living with HIV and attending an infectious disease clinic in Malaysia were collected, and HIV VL was quantified using fresh plasma (the reference standard), FDPS, and DBS specimens. VL testing was done using the Roche Cobas AmpliPrep/Cobas TaqMan v2.0 assay. At a threshold of 1,000 copies/ml, the diagnostic performance of the FDPS was superior (sensitivity, 100% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 89.1 to 100%]; specificity, 100% [95% CI, 97.8 to 100%]) to that of the DBS (sensitivity, 100% [95% CI, 89.4 to 100%]; specificity, 36.8% [95% CI, 29.4 to 44.7%]) (P < 0.001). A stronger correlation was observed between the FDPS VL and the plasma VL (r = 0.94; P < 0.001) than between the DBS VL and the plasma VL (r = 0.85; P < 0.001). The mean difference in VL measures between the FDPS and plasma (plasma VL minus FDPS VL) was 0.127 log10 copies/ ml (standard deviation [SD], 0.32), in contrast to - 0.95 log10 copies/ml (SD, 0.84) between the DBS and plasma. HIV VL measurement using the FDPS outperformed that with the DBS in identifying treatment failure at a threshold of 1,000 copies/ml and compared well with the quantification of VL in plasma. The FDPS can be an attractive alternative to fresh plasma for improving access to HIV VL monitoring among people living with HIV on ART in LMICs. ? 2019 Pham et al.",Diagnostic accuracy; Dried blood spot (DBS); HIV; Malaysia; Plasma separation; Viral load,adult; antiretroviral therapy; Article; clinical outcome; correlational study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; diagnostic value; dried blood spot testing; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; Human immunodeficiency virus infected patient; limit of agreement; limit of quantitation; low income country; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle income country; priority journal; prospective study; quantitative analysis; sensitivity and specificity; treatment failure; venous blood; virus load,2-s2.0-85065503424

Data on the use of scalp cooling in Asian countries are limited, and evidence for its use and efficacy among our patients are not available. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of scalp cooling among breast cancer patients in our study population. METHODS: Consecutive breast cancer patients receiving FE 75 C, FE 100 C, FE 100 C-D, docetaxel 75 or docetaxel, and cyclophosphamide (TC) at our treatment center were recruited and allocated to the treatment (scalp cooling, DigniCapTM system) or control group in this prospective nonrandomized controlled study. The assessment of alopecia was carried out using the World Health Organization grading system and clinical photographs. RESULTS: Seventy patients were recruited, but only 25 completed the study and were evaluable for analysis. Five of 12 patients (42%) in the scalp cooling group managed to preserve hair. Two of three patients who received FE 75 C and TC regimens had minimal hair loss. All patients treated with FE 100 C had severe hair loss. Half of all patients who received scalp cooling throughout chemotherapy rated the treatment as reasonably well tolerated. The most common reason for discontinuing scalp cooling was intolerance to its side effects. CONCLUSION: Scalp cooling is potentially effective in reducing CIA caused by docetaxel, TC, and FE 75 C chemotherapy regimen. However, it was not well tolerated by our study population. The dropout rate was high, and this needs to be taken into consideration when pursuing further trials in a similar setting. ? 2018 Perspektivy Nauki i Obrazovania.

EBV infection has been diagnosed by serologic testing within the tumour biopsies of patients with NHL. However, the association between EBV and NHL is inconsistent with a preference for certain anatomic sites, histologic subtypes and immunosuppressed patients. The objective of this study was to characterise the B-cell NHLs of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region using histological and immunophenotypical techniques and to determine its association with EBV infection. Materials and Methods: This was a descriptive cross-sectional study that included 14 cases of B-cell NHLs of the oral cavity and maxillofacial region. The haematopoietic and lymphoid tissue tumours classification of WHO was used to categorize the cases. In-situ hybridisation for EBV–encoded RNA was performed to confirm the EBV infection. Results: The average age of the patients included in the study was found to be 48.8 ± 23 years with a higher female to male ratio (1.3:1). Our study suggested that diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) and Burkitt’s lymphomas (BLs) constitute the predominant subtypes of lymphomas affecting the oral cavity and maxillofacial regions. Conclusion: The findings from our study support the view that at least a relatively smaller proportion of B-cell NHLs that occur in the oral cavity and maxillofacial region do not have a pathogenic association with EBV. ? 2018, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is one of the new non-invasive modality to enhance the motor recovery in stroke patients. Objectives: This pilot study compared the motor evoked potential (MEP) changes using different settings of rTMS in the post-ischemic stroke patient. The goal of the study is to identify effect sizes for a further trial and evaluate safety aspects. Methods: Eight post-stroke patients with upper limb hemiparesis for at least six months duration were studied in a tertiary hospital in Northeast Malaysia. Quasi experimental design was applied and the participants were randomised into two groups using software generated random numbers. One of the two settings: i) inhibitory setting, or ii) facilitatory setting have been applied randomly during the first meeting. The motor evoked potential (MEP) were recorded before and after application of the rTMS setting. A week later, a similar procedure will be repeated but using different setting than the first intervention. Each patient will serve as their own control. Repeated measures ANOVA test was applied to determine the effect sizes for both intervention through the options of partial eta-squared (η2p). Result: The study observed large effect sizes (η2p &gt; 0.14) for both rTMS settings in the lesion and non-lesion sides. For safety aspects, no minor or major side effects associated with the rTMS was reported by the participants. Conclusions: The partial eta square of MEP value for both rTMS settings (fascilitatory and inhibitory) in both lesion and non-lesion sides represents large effect sizes. We recommend further trial to increase number of sample in order to study the effectiveness of both settings in ischemic stroke patient. Our preliminary data showed both settings may improve the MEP of the upper extremity in the ischemic stroke patient. No significant improvement noted when comparing both settings. ?

We aimed to develop a substantive and empirical theoretical framework to explain GPs’ decision-making process to participate in research. Methods We used the grounded theory approach to construct a substantive theory to explain the decision-making process of GPs to participate in research activities. Five in-depth interviews and four focus group discussions were conducted among 21 GPs. Purposeful sampling followed by theoretical sampling were used to attempt saturation of the core category. Data were collected using semi-structured open-ended questions. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and checked prior to analysis. Open line-by-line coding followed by focus coding were used to arrive at a substantive theory. Memoing was used to help bring concepts to higher abstract levels. Results The GPs’ decision to participate in research was attributed to their inner drive and appreciation for primary care research and their confidence in managing their social and research environments. The drive and appreciation for research motivated the GPs to undergo research training to enhance their research knowledge, skills and confidence. However, the critical step in the GPs’ decision to participate in research was their ability to align their research agenda with priorities in their social environment, which included personal life goals, clinical practice and organisational culture. Perceived support for research, such as funding and technical expertise, facilitated the GPs’ participation in research. In addition, prior experiences participating in research also influenced the GPs’ confidence in taking part in future research. Conclusions The key to GPs deciding to participate in research is whether the research agenda aligns with the priorities in their social environment. Therefore, research training is important, but should be included in further measures and should comply with GPs’ social environments and research support. ? 2018 Tong et al.

Here, we investigated the factors present in ASL that is likely to influence bacterial adhesion and invasion leading to improved understanding of bacterial pathogenesis. Six B. pseudomallei clinical isolates from different origins were used to investigate the ability of the bacteria to adhere and invade A549 human lung epithelial cells using a system that mimics the physiological ASL with different pH, NaCl, KCl, CaCl2 and glucose concentrations. These parameters resulted in markedly differential adherence and invasion abilities of B. pseudomallei to the lung epithelial cells. The concentration of 20 mM glucose dramatically increased adherence and invasion by increasing the rate of pili formation in depiliated bacteria. Glucose significantly increased adherence and invasion of B. pseudomallei to A549 cells, and presence of NaCl, KCl and CaCl2 markedly ablated the effect despite the presence of?glucose. Our data established a link between glucose, enhanced adhesion and invasion potentials of B. pseudomallei, hinting increased susceptibility of individuals with diabetes mellitus to clinical melioidosis. ? 2018 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd",,glucose; bacterium adherence; Burkholderia pseudomallei; epithelium cell; genetics; human; lung; melioidosis; metabolism; microbiology; pathogenicity; physiology; virulence; Bacterial Adhesion; Burkholderia pseudomallei; Epithelial Cells; Glucose; Humans; Lung; Melioidosis; Virulence,2-s2.0-85042382988

In Malaysia, screening osteoporosis in all elderly women is not mandatory due to its cost. One approach to address this gap is to develop a pharmacist-led osteoporosis screening and prevention program. However, there is a paucity of data on the perspectives of Malaysian pharmacists in this area. Objective To explore the perspective of stakeholders (policy makers, doctors, pharmacists, nurses and patients) towards the role of pharmacists in osteoporosis screening and management. Setting A primary care clinic located within a teaching hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Method Patients (n?=?20), nurses (n?=?10), pharmacists (n?=?11), doctors (n?=?10) and policy makers (n?=?5) were individually interviewed using a semi-structured topic guide. Purposive sampling was used. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Main outcome measure Perspective of stakeholders on the current and future role of pharmacists. Results All participants perceived pharmacists to be suppliers of medication, although there was some recognition of roles in providing medication advice. Nonetheless, these stakeholders were eager for pharmacists to expand their non-dispensing roles towards counselling, creating awareness and screening of osteoporosis. Interviewed pharmacists referred to their current role as ‘robotic dispensers’ and unanimously agreed to spread out to osteoporosis management role. Conclusion Under stakeholders there is a willingness to expand the role of pharmacists in Malaysia to non-dispensing roles, particularly in osteoporosis screening and management. ? 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Malaysia; Osteoporosis; Pharmacist role; Postmenopausal; Qualitative; Screening,"administrative personnel; adult; aged; Article; clinical article; controlled study; drug cost; drug safety; female; health promotion; human; Malaysia; male; nurse attitude; osteoporosis; patient attitude; patient care; patient counseling; patient education; pharmacist attitude; physician attitude; primary health care; priority journal; purposive sample; screening test; semi structured interview; stakeholder engagement; teaching hospital; thematic analysis; counseling; disease management; forecasting; health personnel attitude; mass screening; middle aged; osteoporosis; outpatient department; pharmacist; procedures; professional standard; risk reduction; trends; utilization; Aged; Attitude of Health Personnel; Counseling; Disease Management; Female; Forecasting; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Osteoporosis; Outpatient Clinics, Hospital; Pharmacists; Professional Role; Risk Reduction Behavior",2-s2.0-85041120937

The pathogenesis of gastric ulceration was explained by many scientists through different experimental animal models. The imbalance between the offensive elements and defensive mechanisms of the stomach play a major role in the incidence of gastric injury. Helicobacter pylori infection, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), ethanol addiction, smoking, and stress are considered as detrimental agents that damage the gastric mucosa. Gum Arabic was traditionally used to treat many disorders, including stomach illness. Researchers linked the constituents of gum Arabic and its efficacy in maintaining the normal status of gastric mucosa. The high percentage of polysaccharides in the aqueous solution of gum Arabic may explain its gastroprotective potential against gastritis and be a promising therapy in treating gastric cancer. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The most common autosomal recessive conditions are thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease, with higher carrier rates in specific patient populations. Identifying and counselling couples at genetic risk of the conditions before pregnancy enables them to make fully informed reproductive decisions, with some of these choices not being available if genetic counselling is only offered in an antenatal setting. This is an update of a previously published review.OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment to improve reproductive outcomes in women and their partners who are identified as carriers of thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease in healthcare settings when compared to usual care.SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Cystic Fibrosis and Genetic Disorders Group's Trials Registers. In addition, we searched for all relevant trials from 1970 (or the date at which the database was first available if after 1970) to date using electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO), clinical trial databases (National Institutes of Health, Clinical Trials Search portal of the World Health Organization, metaRegister of controlled clinical trials), and hand searching of key journals and conference abstract books from 1998 to date (European Journal of Human Genetics, Genetics in Medicine, Journal of Community Genetics). We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and guidelines and also contacted subject experts in the field to request any unpublished or other published trials.Date of latest search of the registers: 20 June 2017.Date of latest search of all other sources: 16 November 2017.SELECTION CRITERIA: Any randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (published or unpublished) comparing reproductive outcomes of systematic preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease when compared to usual care.DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We identified 25 papers, describing 16 unique trials which were potentially eligible for inclusion in the review. However, after assessment, no randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease were found.MAIN RESULTS: No randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease were included. One ongoing trial has been identified which may potentially eligible for inclusion once completed.AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: As no randomised controlled trials of preconception genetic risk assessment for thalassaemia, sickle cell disease, cystic fibrosis, or Tay-Sachs disease were found for inclusion in this review, the research evidence for current policy recommendations is limited to non-randomised studies.Information from well-designed, adequately powered, randomised trials is desirable in order to make more robust recommendations for practice. However, such trials must also consider the legal, ethical, and cultural barriers to implementation of preconception genetic risk assessment.",,"cystic fibrosis; female; genetics; heterozygote detection; human; prepregnancy care; risk assessment; sickle cell anemia; Tay Sachs disease; thalassemia; Anemia, Sickle Cell; Cystic Fibrosis; Female; Genetic Carrier Screening; Humans; Preconception Care; Risk Assessment; Tay-Sachs Disease; Thalassemia",2-s2.0-85045866648

METHODS: Cross-sectional study. Thirty patients with unilateral idiopathic FTMH and thirty age, sex, and race-matched controls were recruited. Axial lengths were measured using laser interferometry. Enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography images were obtained using Heidelberg spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Choroidal thickness was measured at the fovea, and at 1 mm and 2 mm nasally, temporally, superiorly and inferiorly from the center of the fovea. Statistical analysis was performed using independent and paired t-tests, chi-square tests, and Pearson correlation tests (P<0.05). RESULTS: The mean subfoveal choroidal thickness was 201.0±44.0 μm in the FTMH group, 225.3±51.4 μm in the fellow eye group and 262.3±70.3 μm in the control group. The choroid was thinner in FTMH eyes at all locations when compared to control eyes (P<0.05). The fellow eye group also had thinner choroids than the control group at all locations except at 1 mm and 2 mm nasal to the fovea (P<0.05). Choroidal thickness in the FTMH group was lower than in the fellow eye group, but the differences were not statistically significant (P>0.05). Choroidal thickness was generally highest subfoveally and lowest nasally. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was negatively correlated with age (r=-0.278, P=0.032), and axial length (r=-0.328, P=0.011). CONCLUSION: Choroidal thickness is lower in both eyes of patients with unilateral FTMH compared to healthy control eyes.

METHODS We reviewed retrospectively the performance of pediatric colonoscopies in a training center in Malaysia over 5 years (January 2010-December 2015), benchmarked against five quality indicators: appropriateness of indications, bowel preparations, cecum and ileal examination rates, and complications. The European Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy guideline for pediatric endoscopy and North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition training guidelines were used as benchmarks. RESULTS Median (± SD) age of 121 children [males = 74 (61.2%)] who had 177 colonoscopies was 7.0 (± 4.6) years. On average, 30 colonoscopies were performed each year (range: 19-58). Except for investigations of abdominal pain (21/177, 17%), indications for colonoscopies were appropriate in the remaining 83%. Bowel preparation was good in 87%. One patient (0.6%) with severe Crohn’s disease had bowel perforation. Cecum examination and ileal intubation rate was 95% and 68.1%. Ileal intubation rate was significantly higher in diagnosing or assessing inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) than non-IBD (72.9% vs 50.0% P = 0.016). Performance of four trainees was consistent throughout the study period. Average cecum and ileal examination rate among trainees were 97% and 77%. CONCLUSION Benchmarking against established guidelines helps units with a low-volume of colonoscopies to identify area for further improvement. ? The Author(s) 2018.

These have contributed to societal concerns prompting the authorities to enforce Private Healthcare Facilities and Services Act 1998 (Act 586) that regulates all private hospitals nationwide in 2006. Employing a case study approach, this paper discusses some salient themes on the impact of Act 586 on 15 purposively selected private hospitals in the Klang Valley in terms of achieving the national objectives of accessibility, equity and quality care. This study reveals several interrelated themes such as of policy, power, governance, compliance, and quality of care in achieving the national objective. Findings point to high investment of the state in private hospitals. Although a private hospital is stipulated to be a physician-led institution, in reality the majority of these hospitals are owned by government-linked corporations. Many private hospitals face major challenges in terms of compliance with the new regulations meant to improve patient safety and quality of care. However, full compliance to the regulations remains an insurmountable challenge as the private providers are influential. Faced with political constraints, asymmetric information and inadequate human resources, the regulatory authority seems hampered in its enforcement capacity. ? 2018, Faculty of Economics and Administration.

Material and methods: The RFA of a spherical tumor of 2.0 cm diameter along with 0.5 cm clinical safety margin was simulated using Finite Element Analysis software. A total of 86 points inside one-eighth of the tumor volume along the axial, sagittal and coronal planes were selected as the target sites for electrode-tip placement. The angle of the electrode insertion in both craniocaudal and orbital planes ranged from ?90° to +90° with 30° increment. The RFA electrode was simulated to pass through the target site at different angles in combination of both craniocaudal and orbital planes before being advanced to the edge of the tumor. Results: Complete tumor ablation was observed whenever the electrode-tip penetrated through the epicenter of the tumor regardless of the angles of electrode insertion in both craniocaudal and orbital planes. Complete tumor ablation can also be achieved by placing the electrode-tip at several optimal sites and angles. Conclusions: Identification of the tumor epicenter on the central slice of the axial images is essential to enhance the success rate of complete tumor ablation during RFA procedures. ? 2017 Society of Medical Innovation and Technology.",electrode trajectory; finite element analysis; Liver tumor; radiofrequency ablation; tumor targeting,"Article; cancer tissue; controlled study; finite element analysis; liver tissue; liver tumor; priority journal; radiofrequency ablation; surgical margin; therapy effect; tumor ablation; tumor volume; biological model; catheter ablation; computer simulation; electrode implant; finite element analysis; liver; liver tumor; procedures; Catheter Ablation; Computer Simulation; Electrodes, Implanted; Finite Element Analysis; Liver; Liver Neoplasms; Models, Biological",2-s2.0-85020758021

Objectives: The purpose of the study was to investigate the prevalence of pathological internet use among undergraduate university students in five ASEAN countries in relation to sociodemographics, internet use variables, psychosocial factors, and comorbid symptoms. Methods: In a cross-sectional survey in 2015 in Indonesia (Yogyakarta), Malaysia (Kuala Lumpur), Myanmar (Yangon), Thailand (MahaSarakham), and Vietnam (Hanoi), 3240 undergraduate university students (Mean age = 20.5 years, SD = 1.6), who were randomly selected, responded to a questionnaire including the ""Young Diagnostic Questionnaire for Internet Addiction"" (YDQ) and other measures. Results: Overall, the prevalences of pathological internet use were 35.9% (ranging from 16.1% in Myanmar to 52.4% in Thailand), maladaptive use 34.8% and adjusted Internet users 29.9%. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, internet use variables (heavy overall Internet use, heavy Internet use for recreational purposes, and heavy smartphone use), psychosocial factors (the experience of childhood physical abuse, childhood sexual abuse, lack of social support, and poor academic performance), and comorbid symptoms (having a self-classified gambling problem, hazardous or harmful alcohol use, past 12-month drug use, severe depression, sleeping problems, having attempted a suicide, and PTSD symptoms) were found to be associated with pathological internet use. Conclusions: The study found a very high prevalence of pathological internet use; those students lacking psychosocial support and having comorbid symptoms were at the highest risk. ?2018, Iranian Journal of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences.",Asia; Comorbidity; Internet; Psychosocial factors; Students,academic achievement; adult; Article; behavior disorder assessment; child abuse; child sexual abuse; cross-sectional study; female; health behavior; human; Indonesia; internet addiction; life event; life satisfaction; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; Myanmar; psychosocial disorder; risk factor; social psychology; social support; Thailand; undergraduate student; university student; Viet Nam; young adult; Young Diagnostic Questionnaire,2-s2.0-85046277687

Methods: A prospective cross sectional study was performed with 9 female patients diagnosed with CTS by clinical evaluation and nerve conduction study and 8 age and sex matched normal patients. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) wrist was performed with pre-set axial PD and DTI protocol on a 3T MRI, images post-processed using 3D SLICER software to generate median nerve tract and measure diffusion parameters FA, MD, AD and RD in segments and focal points. Results: The FA values were significantly lower in CTS patients, 0.454 (± 0.065), p< 0.002 and demonstrates negative correlation with disease severity, r = - 0.510, p = 0.002.The mean MD, 1.090 (± 0.178) and mean RD, 0.834 (± 0.128) is higher in CTS patients, p = 0.041 and p = 0.014 respectively. They show an increasing trend with increasing disease severity. Negative correlation was noted between the FA values and age groups. FA cut of value of ? 0.487 with sensitivity 70.6 % and specificity 76.5%, is suggested for diagnosing CTS. Conclusion: MR neurography using DTI can be utilised to detect CTS.

Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a low-income housing area in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Data were collected using a questionnaire via face-to-face interviews by trained enumerators in order to obtain details on sociodemographic characteristics and dietary practices. Results: Descriptive statistics showed that 86.7% of the respondents in the low-income community consumed fruit and vegetables less than five times per day, 11.7% consumed carbonated and sweetened drinks more than twice per day and about 25% consumed fast food more than four times per month. In total, 65.2% (n=945) did not have healthy dietary practices. Binary logistic regression showed that age, education and ethnicity were significant predictors of unhealthy dietary practices among the low-income community. Those in the 30-59 years age group had higher odds (odds ratio 1.65, p=0.04) of practising an unhealthy diet as compared with those older than 60 years of age.

In Malaysia, due to the limited number of cadaveric and compatible living related renal transplant (LRRT), there is a need to explore the potential of transplant with ABO-incompatible and positive donor specific antibodies (DSA). This report describes a case series of sensitized patients undergoing kidney transplant. Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the immediate graft function (IGF), graft functions at the 1st month, 3rd month, 6th month and 12th month post-transplant. Graft functions were assessed using serum creatinine, protocol biopsy (at 1st, 3rd, 6th and 12th months post-transplant) and DSA level. Methods: Data was collected from all sensitized kidney transplant done at the University Malaya Medical Center (UMMC) between February 2016 and April 2017. ABO-incompatible kidney transplant will be excluded from this study. The patient's progress and outcome (kidney function) are fully documented. Results: Five patients were analyzed for this report. The first two patients developed antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) immediately, post-transplant. Learning from initial experience, we have adopted our own desensitization protocol and subsequent to that, all three patients had IGF. Three out of five patients have borderline rejection on protocol biopsy but did not require pulse with methylprednisolone or intensification of immunosuppression. Three patients had negative preformed DSAs at 3-month post-transplant. Conclusion: Desensitization protocols may help to overcome incompatibility barriers in live-donor renal transplantation. Based on our experiences we have adopted a protocol that comprises of intravenous rituximab, plasma exchange and intravenous thymoglobulin. ? 2018 The Authors",Desensitization; Donor specific antibodies; Kidney transplant; Plasma exchange,antibody; basiliximab; hemoglobin; immunoglobulin; methylprednisolone; prednisolone; rituximab; tacrolimus; thymocyte antibody; acute hepatitis; adult; antibody mediated rejection; Article; biopsy; cadaver; case report; clinical article; complement dependent cytotoxicity; creatinine blood level; desensitization; dialysis; drug megadose; dyspnea; end stage renal disease; female; flow cytometry; hemoptysis; human; human tissue; immunosuppressive treatment; kidney graft; male; middle aged; plasma exchange; priority journal; teaching hospital,2-s2.0-85044162542

It is a disease of public health concern in many parts of the world. In this study, we described the seroprevalence of Q fever among selected populations of Orang Asli (OA), indigenous people, many of whom live within the forest fringe areas of Peninsular Malaysia. Serum samples were obtained from 887 OA participants from selected villages. Samples were analyzed for the presence of IgG antibodies reactive against C. burnetii by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical methods were used to identify possible associations between seropositivity for C. burnetii and a number of demographic variables obtained from the questionnaires. In total, 9.6% (n = 85/887) of the serum samples were reactive to C. burnetii. Statistical results suggest that elderly male OA residing in OA village, Bukit Payung, were most likely to be tested seropositive for C. burnetii. This study suggests that OA are at a significant risk of contracting C. burnetii infection, and both demographic and geographic factors are important contributors to this risk. Further prospective studies are needed to establish the true burden of C. burnetii infection within the indigenous population as well as within Peninsular Malaysia as a whole. ?

Method: A cross-sectional qualitative study in which focus group interviews were conducted by 5 trained senior Cambodian dental students. A convenience sample of 56 older adults and caregivers was recruited across urban, semi-urban and rural locations. Focus group conversations were recorded, transcribed and analysed thematically. Results: The themes that emerged were around low expectations for both general health and oral health. A communal responsibility for health was expressed, and both money and transport were identified as key barriers to accessing care. Participants recognised that they had oral health problems, and acknowledged the impact of poor oral function on health and nutrition. Conclusion: This study is an important first step in better understanding the oral health experiences and perceptions of older people in Cambodia.

Its effectiveness on improving wellbeing in people with epilepsy (PWE) has been shown in a few studies. This study aimed to explore factors related to participants' willingness to engage in psychological interventions from the perspective of patients with epilepsy. Methods: Participants answered a needs assessment questionnaire eliciting information about their illness perception (Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire (Brief-IPQ)), emotions (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), willingness to participate in psychological interventions, preferences in types of PPI and intervention designs, as well as barriers in seeking mental health services. Results: A total of 154 patients with epilepsy participated, with a mean age of 37.3 years (range 16–86 years). Most patients had focal epilepsy (68.2%), and drug-resistant (59.1%). Majority (71.4%) of them indicated a strong willingness to participate in PPI. Out of nine types of PPI, character strengths, mindfulness-based and expressive-based interventions were highly preferred. Those with negative illness perception (p = 0.001), anxiety (p = 0.004), and being unemployed (p = 0.048) were more willing to participate in PPI. Most participants preferred group rather than individual session, and a shorter duration (30 min) was favored by most. Conclusion: This study captured the self-report willingness to participate in psychological interventions. Findings suggested that psychological interventions delivered in short-group session were highly preferred.

Traditionally, P. macrocarpa has been used to control cancer, impotency, hemorrhoids, diabetes mellitus, allergies, liver and heart disease, kidney disorders, blood diseases, acne, stroke, migraine, and various skin diseases. Aim of the study Recent studies have demonstrated a potent anticancer potential of P. macrocarpa, especially against HeLa cell. The objective of this study was to investigate the regulation of miRNAs on MDA-MB-231 treated with P. macrocarpa ethyl acetate fraction (PMEAF). Materials and methods The regulation of miRNAs on MDA-MB-231 cells treated with PMEAF was studied through IIlumina, Hi-Seq. 2000 platform of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and various in silico bioinformatics tools. Results The PMEAF treatment against MDA-MB-231 cells identified 10 upregulated and 10 downregulated miRNAs. A set of 606 target genes of 10 upregulated miRNAs and 517 target genes of 10 downregulated miRNAs were predicted based on computational and validated databases by using miRGate DB Query. Meanwhile, results from DAVID Bioinformatics Resources 6.8 specified the functional annotation of the upregulated miRNAs involvement in cancer pathway by suppressing the oncogenes and downregulating miRNAs by expressing the tumour suppressor genes in the regulation of apoptosis pathway. Conclusion In conclusion, the results of this study proved that PMEAF is a promising anticancer agent with high cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and it induced apoptotic cell death mechanism through the regulation of miRNAs. PMEAF might be the best candidate for developing more potent anticancer drugs or chemo preventive supplements. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Anticancer; Apoptosis; Gene ontology; miRNA; Phaleria macrocarpa,"acetic acid ethyl ester; antineoplastic agent; microRNA; microRNA 100 3p; microRNA 125a 3p; microRNA 128 1 5p; microRNA 132 3p; microRNA 146a 5p; microRNA 146b 5p; microRNA 148a 3p; microRNA 15b 5p; microRNA 181a 2 3p; microRNA 192 5p; microRNA 200c 3p; microRNA 20a 5p; microRNA 210 5p; microRNA 215 5p; microRNA 23a 5p; microRNA 27a 5p; microRNA 29b 3p; microRNA 423 3p; microRNA 455 3p; microRNA 99b 5p; Phaleria macrocarpa extract; plant extract; transcriptome; unclassified drug; untranslated RNA; acetic acid; acetic acid ethyl ester; microRNA; plant extract; solvent; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; bioinformatics; breast cancer; computer model; down regulation; drug mechanism; fruit; gene expression; gene expression profiling; gene targeting; genetic identification; high throughput sequencing; human; human cell; MDA-MB-231 cell line; next generation sequencing; oncogene; Phaleria macrocarpa; Thymelaeaceae; tumor suppressor gene; upregulation; biology; breast tumor; chemistry; computer simulation; fruit; genetics; high throughput sequencing; tumor cell line; Acetates; Breast Neoplasms; Cell Line, Tumor; Computational Biology; Computer Simulation; Fruit; High-Throughput Nucleotide Sequencing; Humans; MicroRNAs; Plant Extracts; Solvents; Thymelaeaceae",2-s2.0-85034589782

Due to the overuse of antibiotics, S. pneumoniae has developed a high degree of resistance to a wide range of antibacterial drugs. Methods: In this study, whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed for 10 clinical strains of S. pneumoniae with different levels of sensitivity to standard antibiotics. The main objective was to investigate genetic changes associated with antibiotic resistance in S. pneumoniae. Results: Our results showed that resistant isolates contain a higher number of non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as compared to susceptible isolates. We were able to identify SNPs that alter a single amino acid in many genes involved in virulence and capsular polysaccharide synthesis. In addition, 90 SNPs were only presented in the resistant isolates, and 31 SNPs were unique and had not been previously reported, suggesting that these unique SNPs could play a key role in altering the level of resistance to different antibiotics. Conclusion: Whole genome sequencing is a powerful tool for comparing the full genome of multiple isolates, especially those closely related, and for analysing the variations found within antibiotic resistance genes that lead to differences in antibiotic sensitivity. We were able to identify specific mutations within virulence genes related to resistant isolates. These findings could provide insights into understanding the role of single nucleotide mutants in conferring drug resistance. ? 2018 The Author(s).",Antibiotic-resistance; Penicillin-binding proteins; Single nucleotide polymorphism; Streptococcus Pneumoniae; Whole genome sequencing,"bacterial polysaccharide; cefotaxime; erythromycin; penicillin derivative; tetracycline; antiinfective agent; antibiotic resistance; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; bacterial genome; bacterial mutation; bacterial strain; bacterial virulence; bacterium identification; bacterium isolation; female; gene cluster; gene library; genetic analysis; genetic susceptibility; human; Malaysian; male; nonhuman; priority journal; single nucleotide polymorphism; Streptococcus pneumonia; university hospital; whole genome sequencing; genetics; isolation and purification; Malaysia; microbiology; pneumococcal infection; Streptococcus pneumoniae; whole genome sequencing; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Drug Resistance, Bacterial; Humans; Malaysia; Pneumococcal Infections; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Streptococcus pneumoniae; Whole Genome Sequencing",2-s2.0-85042092711

Thus, this study was conducted to evaluate the influence of rosiglitazone on antiproliferative effect of 5-FU using cellular model. Two human colonic carcinoma cell lines (HCT 116 and HT 29) were cultured in the presence of 5-FU, rosiglitazone or in combination under normal and high glucose concentration. The drug cytotoxicity was evaluated using the MTT assay whereas the assessment of cell cycle was carried out using the flow cytometry technique. Combination index (CI) method was used to determine the drug interaction between rosiglitazone and 5-FU. High glucose diminished the cytotoxic effect of 5-FU but at a high drug dosage, this effect could be overcome. Cell cycle analysis demonstrated that 5-FU and rosiglitazone caused G1-phase arrest and S-phase arrest, respectively. CI values indicated that rosiglitazone exerted synergistic effect on 5-FU regardless of glucose levels. This study is the first to demonstrate the influence of rosiglitazone on cytotoxicity of 5-FU under normal or high glucose level.

This research is a practical one in which data from 11,237 participants of the CLUSTer Cohort Study in Malaysia has been utilized. Metabolic syndrome risk factors used are: fasting blood glucose, waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The data set was stratified by gender and age groups into young, middle-age and old. Data was labeled based on JIS criteria. The MediBoost algorithm outperformed the ASD risk quantification in all the performance metrics for all the subgroups of the CLUSTer dataset. For example, in the young male subgroup the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) are 87.64 (g7.g6), 46.54 (100), g8.g6 (97.46), g2.5 (go.63), 87.04 (100), 72.75 (g6.03) for ASD(MediBoost) respectively. In a two-way sign-to-sign test, the performance metrics of MediBoost is significantly more efficient than ASD.

Apart from economic loss, mycotoxin can have adverse health effects on humans due to the carcinogenicity, teratogenicity and mutagenicity potential of the toxins. Palm kernel cake (PKC) is the largest animal feed production in Malaysia. PKC is a by-product of palm kernel oil processing and it has been exported as animal feed. The purpose of this study was to isolate and characterise toxigenic fungi cultured in three different media, Dichloran Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol (DRBC) Agar, Dichloran 18% Glycerol (DG18) Agar and Malt Extract Agar (MEA), derived from PKC that is stored under three different temperatures, 4°C, 25°C and 60°C. Identification of fungi was carried out based on macroscopy and microscopy as well as molecular identification. Four mycotoxigenic fungi were found: Aspergillus Niger, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus fumigatus and Penicilium citrinum. In order to characterise polymorphism of the isolates, RAPD assay was performed using OPA 3 as the primer. The software resulted in a constructed dendrogram that revealed the percentage of similarities between the typable isolates (A. fumigatus, A. Niger and P. citrinum) within range from 20% to 80%. The effect of storage temperature on the strains' enumeration is reported in this work. The distributing strains are influenced by the storage temperature of the PKC matrices. The findings clearly show that Aspergillus species profused at 25°C PKC storage, while it was restricted at low and high temperature. ?

Materials and Methods: Thirty-two digital orthopantomograms were included, and exported to Adobe? Photoshop? CS3 version 10.0. The length of the crown and root of all posterior teeth were measured. Their roots were identified as being located 'away', 'in contact' or 'appear to project into' the sinus or mandibular canal/mental foramen. The bony distances between the apices of all posterior teeth and these anatomy structures were measured. All posterior teeth were present except for 18 missing maxillary third molars (R = 8, L = 10) and mandibular third molars (R = 9, L = 9) each. Results: There were 75.2% apices that appeared 'in contact' or 'projected into' the sinus, and this involved mainly the second premolar and all molars. In cases with measureable bony distances, the average distances (in mm) in away from the maxillary sinus were 5.61 at first premolar, 2.70 at second premolar, 1.66 at first molar, 2.29 at second molar and 3.28 at third molar. The average distance (in mm) away from the neurovascular structure in the mandible were 5.49 at first premolar, 5.00 at second premolar, 4.50 at first molar, 2.58 at second molar and 1.31 at third molar.

TB often affects those from a low socio-economic background. OBJECTIVE : To assess the socio-economic determinants of TB in HIV-infected patients in Asia. DESIGN: This was a matched case-control study. HIVpositive, TB-positive cases were matched to HIVpositive, TB-negative controls according to age, sex and CD4 cell count. A socio-economic questionnaire comprising 23 questions, including education level, employment, housing and substance use, was distributed. Socio-economic risk factors for TB were analysed using conditional logistic regression analysis. RESULT S : A total of 340 patients (170 matched pairs) were recruited, with 262 (77.1%) matched for all three criteria. Pulmonary TB was the predominant type (n = 115, 67.6%). The main risk factor for TB was not having a university level education (OR 4.45, 95%CI 1.50-13.17, P=0.007). Burning wood or coal regularly inside the house and living in the same place of origin were weakly associated with TB diagnosis. CONCLUS IONS : These data suggest that lower socioeconomic status is associated with an increased risk of TB in Asia.

Human genetic enhancement, however, raises complex ethical questions, such as to what extent should it be allowed? It has been a great challenge for humankind to develop robust ethical guidelines for human genetic enhancement that address both public concerns and needs. We believe that research about public concerns is necessary prior to developing such guidelines, yet the issues have not been thoroughly investigated in many countries, including Malaysia. Since the novel often functions as a medium for the public to express their concerns, this paper explores ethical concerns about human genetic enhancement expressed in four Malay science fiction novels namely Klon, Leksikon Ledang, Transgenesis Bisikan Rimba and Transgenik Sifar. Religion has a strong influence on the worldview of the Malays therefore some concerns such as playing God are obviously religious.

HIV testing is recommended at least annually in high-risk populations, including people who inject drugs (PWID). In Malaysia, the HIV epidemic is concentrated among PWID, but their adherence to testing recommendations and the proportion of HIV-positive PWID who are aware of their status remain unknown. We recruited 460 PWID in Greater Kuala Lumpur using respondent-driven sampling and conducted HIV testing. We examined past testing behaviors, estimating testing frequency, correlates of testing in the past 12 months, and the proportion of those living with HIV who were aware of their status. Results showed that most PWID living with HIV (90.4%, 95% CI: 83.6%–95.9%) were aware of their status. Among those never previously diagnosed with HIV, few had accessed HIV testing in the past 12 months (14.3%, 95% CI: 11.1%–18.0%). Prison (57.0%) and compulsory drug detention centers (36.1%) were the primary locations where PWID reported ever being HIV tested, and the main correlate of recent testing in regression was recent criminal justice involvement. Although awareness of HIV status may be high among PWID living with HIV in Kuala Lumpur, testing occurs primarily in prisons and compulsory drug detention centers, where it is involuntary and linkage to care is limited. A shift in HIV testing policy is needed to align health and human rights objectives, replacing mandatory testing with voluntary testing in settings where individuals can be rapidly linked to HIV care. ? 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",HIV testing; HIV treatment cascade; Malaysia; people who inject drugs,"benzodiazepine; buprenorphine; diamorphine; methadone; methamphetamine; adult; Article; awareness; correlational study; criminal justice; detention; female; human; Human immunodeficiency virus; human rights; intravenous drug abuse; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; mandatory testing; priority journal; prison; attitude to health; awareness; drug use; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; mass screening; middle aged; psychology; risk factor; serology; substance abuse; Adult; Awareness; Drug Users; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; HIV Infections; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Serologic Tests; Substance Abuse, Intravenous",2-s2.0-85028568168

TNBC are highly aggressive, and they are present among 10'15% of all breast cancer subtypes which constitute about 80% of all basal-like tumours. Plants produce diverse number of organic compounds. Traditionally these natural products are known as secondary metabolites or phytometabolites. Bioactive natural products’ chemical structure and function have been studied since the 1850s. Comprehending these chemical structure and functions led to recognition of their biological properties as anticancer drugs. Among phytometabolites, phytoestrogens have been widely studied as a chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent due to their high affinity to interact with estrogen receptors. However, TNBC are indifferent to hormonal therapy, they became a therapeutic hurdle. The only systemic therapy currently left is chemotherapy which often fails due to ability of TNBC to develop resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs. Therefore, different theories exist, which suggest focusing on drugs that target TNBC survival-dependent molecular pathways instead. For instance, several studies reported TNBC depend on NF-KB to survive and avoid apoptosis. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the various bioactive natural products extracted from various parts of plants and mushrooms showing potential inhibitory effect against TNBC. ?

Individuals with evidence of coronary artery disease are at increased risk of further cardiovascular events. However, with good secondary prevention, which consists broadly of lifestyle changes, medical therapy and revascularisation, this risk can be reduced. The true extent of secondary prevention in individuals who are re-admitted with a myocardial infarction in such a high-risk cohort has never been explored in Malaysia. Methods: We performed a retrospective, observational study in a tertiary hospital in 100 individuals with previously diagnosed coronary artery disease admitted with a myocardial infarction from August 2016 to February 2017. Results: Twenty-nine per cent of patients were still smoking; 15% and 47% were not taking antiplatelet or beta-blocker therapy, respectively. A further 45% and 20% of patients were not on any renin-angiotensin-aldosterone inhibition or lipidlowering therapy, respectively. Conclusion: In our high-risk cohort, secondary prevention practices were sub-optimal. Poor physician-patient communication was frequently listed as a major factor.

Among parasites that frequently co-infect the same hosts, are the filarial worms and malaria parasites. Despite this, the mechanisms underlying the interactions between these parasites is still relatively unexplored with very few studies available on the resulting pathologies due to co-infection by filarial nematodes and malaria parasites. Hence, this study investigated the histopathological effect of Brugia pahangi and Plasmodium berghei ANKA (PbA) infections in gerbil host. Gerbils grouped into B. pahangi-infected, PbA-infected, B. pahangi and PbA-coinfected, and uninfected control, were necropsied at different time points of post PbA infections. Brugia pahangi infections in the gerbils were first initiated by subcutaneous inoculation of 50 infective larvae, while PbA infections were done by intraperitoneal injection of 10 6 parasitized red blood cells after 70 days patent period of B. pahangi. Organs such as the lungs, kidneys, spleen, heart and liver were harvested aseptically at the point of necropsy. There was significant hepatosplenomegaly observed in both PbA-infected only and coinfected gerbils. The spleen, liver and lungs were heavily pigmented. Both B. pahangi and PbA infections (mono and co-infections) resulted in pulmonary edema, while glomerulonephritis was associated with PbA infections. The presence of both parasites induced extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen and liver. These findings suggest that the pathologies associated with coinfected gerbils were synergistically induced by both B. pahangi and PbA infections. ? 2018, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

It can be accessed within an institution with multi-level accessibility based on authentication customized to the type of user. Since the EMR system potentiates an organised and holistic medical history specific to a patient, it enables medical professionals to deliver a higher quality of healthcare services. Aims: The aims of this study were to understand the global perspective of EMR and its implementation as well as to locate the gaps of knowledge that still existed in the understanding and definition of EMR amongst patients and hospital staff. Methods: All major bibliographic databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar and several specialist datasets such as PsycINFO, MEDLINE and EBSCOhost from the previous 10 years (2007-2017) were employed in our search. Paper citations which utilised a reference standard were incorporated for quality assessment. An initial search found 2700 articles however after factoring in the inclusion and exclusion criteria, only 78 articles were included in this review. Results: Our findings indicated a discrepancy between the expectation of patients and what was actually practiced. Patient concerns mainly involved easy access of healthcare professionals other than doctors to their EMR in addition to non-medical information. The assumption of confidentiality was expected to be maintained by indifference; however, a good face-to-face explanation cannot be substituted with control over content and access to EMR. In the event of a breach in patient confidentiality, lawsuits against healthcare providers will rise exponentially as patients are now well-informed and more empowered to ask questions regarding the care they are receiving and information being disclosed to other parties. Conclusion: Security of information can be attained with better modelling protocols, end-user training and refresher courses done on a regular basis. Finally, controls of access will need to be implemented via passwords and digital signatures. ? 2018 Dhillon et al.",Confidentiality; Electronic medical record; EMR access; EMR content; Healthcare professionals; Patients,adult; confidentiality; electronic medical record; expectation; female; hospital personnel; human; law suit; male; Medline; PsycINFO; quality control; refresher course; review; systematic review,2-s2.0-85060683059

The researchers identified 523 publications on EBL, as indexed by Scopus and Web of Science with no date limitation. A range of software tools (Ravar PreMap, Netdraw, UCINet and VOSviewer) were utilized for data visualization and analysis. Results - Results of the study revealed that the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) occupied the topmost positions regarding centrality measures, clearly indicating their important structural roles in EBL research. The network of EBL research in terms of the degree of connectedness showed low density in the co-authorship networks of both authors (0.013) and countries (0.214). Seven subject clusters were identified in the EBL research network, four of which related to health and medicine. The occurrence of the keywords related to these four subject clusters suggested that EBL research had a greater association with the setting of health and medicine than with traditional librarianship elements such as human resources or library collection management.

Frequent HS outbreak has a major impact in many Asian countries, including Malaysia, where farmers encounter economic loss due to low milk production as well as death of their livestock. There are four types of vaccines available; broth bacterins, alum precipitated vaccine, aluminium hydroxide gel vaccine and oil adjuvant vaccine (OAV), but these vaccines can only provide short term immunity and therefore need to be administered annually. Hence, the development of a protein vaccine using recombinant antigen can be a potential candidate for the production of HS vaccine that would give longer immunity. We have successfully cloned the ABA392 gene fragment into a protein expression vector, pET-30a. The protein was expressed from our ABA392/pET30a clone and the immunogenicity of the protein has been tested on rats. This vaccine was able to trigger an immune response and therefore has the potential to be tested as suitable vaccine candidate in future studies. It is envisaged that this subunit vaccine will make a significant contribution in the management of HS among livestock in future. ? 2018, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

We propose that the modified early warning score performs well in predicting the need of lifesaving interventions in the emergency department, as a predictor of patients who are critically ill. Objective: The study aims to evaluate the use of modified early warning score in sorting out critically ill patients in the emergency department. Methods: The patients’ demographic data and first vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, respiratory rate, and level of consciousness) were collected prospectively. Individual modified early warning score was calculated. The outcome was a patient received one or more lifesaving interventions toward the end of stay in emergency department. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was utilized to assess the association between modified early warning score and other potential predictors with outcome. Results: There are a total of 259 patients enrolled into the study. The optimal modified early warning score in predicting lifesaving intervention was ?4 with a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 81%. Modified early warning score ?4 (odds ratio = 96.97, 95% confidence interval = 11.82-795.23, p < 0.001) was found to significantly increase the risk of receiving lifesaving intervention in the emergency department. Conclusion: Modified early warning score is found to be a good predictor for patients in need of lifesaving intervention in the emergency department. ?

Engineered ankyrin targeting the HIV-1 matrix (MA) would be a promising agent to interfere with HIV replication, since MA plays a major role in multiple processes of the viral life cycle. In this study, MA-specific ankyrin (AnkGAGG31) was isolated from an artificial ankyrin library using a semi-automated selection process with biotinylated MA-streptavidin magnetic beads. The AnkGAGG31-recognition site on MA was determined using both indirect and competitive ELISAs with overlapping MA tri-helical fragments and pentadecapeptides. The AnkGAGG31 showed the highest binding signal to the MA-fragments covering helices 2-3-4 and peptides corresponding to helix 2 (residues 25-43), which were found as the target epitope. This finding was further analyzed by molecular modeling and docking. The rational models of AnkGAGG31-MA complex indicated that the strong binding interaction was shown on helix 2 at key residues K27MA, K30M, and K32MA. Taken together, the identification of the binding domain on the MA target improves our understanding of the AnkGAGG31-MA interaction and provides the information necessary to design innovative protein targeting of the MA protein. ? 2018, Chiang Mai University.",Ankyrin; Binding domain; HIV-1 matrix; MA protein; Phage-displayed panning,,2-s2.0-85057972166

While an antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) programme has been implemented in Malaysia, the perception and practices of public hospital pharmacists remain unknown. The aim of this study was to determine the perception and practices of Malaysian public hospital pharmacists towards the AMS programme in the state of Selangor, Malaysia. Methods: A cross-sectional study, using a validated 23-item self-administered questionnaire, was conducted among pharmacists from 11 public hospitals in the State of Selangor, Malaysia, from December 2016 to January 2017. All public hospital pharmacists (n=432) were invited to participate in the survey. A 5-point Likert scale was employed in the questionnaire; the perception section was scored from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) while the practice section was scored from 1 (never) to 5 (always). Both descriptive and inferential statistical analyses were used to analyse data. Results: Of the 432 pharmacists surveyed, 199 responded, giving a response rate of 46.0%. The majority of the respondents agreed (n=190, 95.5%) that the AMS programme improves patient care at their hospitals (median=5; IQR=1). Slightly less than half of the respondents indicated that a local antibiotic guideline was established in their hospitals (median=3, IQR=2.5), and had taken part in antimicrobial awareness campaigns to promote optimal use of antimicrobials in hospitals (median=3, IQR=1). Conclusions: Overall, the perception and practices of the surveyed hospital pharmacists towards AMS programme were positive. National antibiotic guidelines, which take into consideration local antimicrobial resistance patterns, should be used fully to improve antimicrobial usage and to reduce practice variation. Collaboration among healthcare professionals should be strengthened to minimise the unfavourable consequences of unintended use of antimicrobial agents while optimising clinical outcomes. ?

Loss and functional failure of pancreatic β-cells, the parenchyma cells in the islets of Langerhans, progress diabetes mellitus. The increasing incidence of this metabolic disorder necessitates efficient strategies to produce functional β-cells for treating diabetes mellitus. Human induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC), hold potential for treating diabetes ownig to their self-renewal capacity and the ability to differentiate into β-cells. iPSC technology also provides unlimited starting material to generate differentiated cells for regenerative applications. Progress has also been made in establishing in-vitro culture protocols to yield definitive endoderm, pancreatic endoderm progenitor cells and β-cells via different reprogramming strategies and growth factor supplementation. However, these generated β-cells are still immature, lack functional characteristics and exhibit lower capability in reversing the diseases conditions. Current methods employed to generate mature and functional β-cells include; use of small and large molecules to enhance the reprogramming and differentiation efficiency, 3D culture systems to improve the functional properties and heterogeneity of differentiated cells. This review details recent advancements in the generation of mature β-cells by reprogramming stem cells into iPSCs that are further programmed to β-cells. It also provides deeper insight into current reprogramming protocols and their efficacy, focusing on the underlying mechanism of chemical-based approach to generate iPSCs. Furthermore, we have highlighted the recent differentiation strategies both in-vitro and in-vivo to date and the future prospects in the generation of mature β-cells. ? 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.",Chemical-based reprogramming; Diabetes mellitus; Embryonic stem cells; Induced pluripotent stem cells; Mature insulin producing β-cells; Small and large molecules,"4 [(5,6,7,8 tetrahydro 5,5,8,8 tetramethyl 2 naphthyl)carboxamido]benzoic acid; 4 [4 (1,3 benzodioxol 5 yl) 5 (2 pyridinyl) 1h imidazol 2 yl]benzamide; activin; adenovirus vector; beta catenin; bone morphogenetic protein; butyric acid; fibroblast growth factor 2; glucose; histone deacetylase; histone deacetylase inhibitor; histone demethylase; histone methyltransferase; insulin detemir; insulin glargine; kruppel like factor 4; lentivirus vector; n (1 benzyl 4 piperidinyl) 2 (hexahydro 4 methyl 1h 1,4 diazepin 1 yl) 6,7 dimethoxy 4 quinazolinamine; n (2,3 dihydroxypropoxy) 3,4 difluoro 2 (2 fluoro 4 iodoanilino)benzamide; n phthaloyltryptophan; octamer transcription factor 4; protein Nodal; retrovirus vector; rsc 133; Smad protein; transforming growth factor beta; tranylcypromine; trichostatin A; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; valproic acid; vorinostat; insulin; cell differentiation; cell maturation; cell subpopulation; diabetes mellitus; DNA integration; embryo development; epigenetics; epithelial mesenchymal transition; gene delivery system; gene expression; genetic engineering; genetic transduction; genetic transfection; genomic instability; hedgehog signaling; human; human embryonic stem cell; induced pluripotent stem cell; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin release; insulin treatment; mutagenesis; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nuclear reprogramming; pancreas islet beta cell; pancreas islet transplantation; pluripotent stem cell; protein expression; quality of life; Review; Sendai virus; signal transduction; stem cell transplantation; transgene; animal; cell culture; cytology; diabetes mellitus; drug effect; induced pluripotent stem cell; metabolism; molecular library; pancreas islet beta cell; pharmacology; regenerative medicine; transplantation; Animals; Cell Differentiation; Cells, Cultured; Cellular Reprogramming; Diabetes Mellitus; Humans; Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells; Insulin; Insulin-Secreting Cells; Regenerative Medicine; Signal Transduction; Small Molecule Libraries",2-s2.0-85057565356

Leaders in psychiatric education from nine Asia Pacific countries prepared country reports, based on a suggested list of items and met for a day to discuss and identify implementable solutions to improve the current unsatisfactory status of postgraduate training in psychiatry. Recent findings Except Japan, all the other countries have a very low number of psychiatrists per 100000 population – far lower than the global target of 10 psychiatrist per 100000 population. The undergraduate teaching in psychiatry in majority of the countries is restricted to 20h of lectures given during the 4–6 semester and 2–3 weeks of clinical ward placements. The duration as well as the overall quality of postgraduate training and methods of assessment and accreditation varies widely across and within countries. Summary Numerous gaps that need to be addressed to enhance the quality of psychiatrists trained in Asia were identified.

However, buildings are also exposed to the various forces of change since the performance of buildings are not static over time. Issues in existing buildings such as space problems, poor design of emergency exits, inefficient energy use, air pollutions and ventilation discomfort are among the factors that may contribute to the failure of building performance. These malfunctions do not only affect the sustainability of buildings, but also the occupants who are also likely to be directly impacted by the building failure. Crucially, performance failure of a building also creates various risk issues and a direct impact to the building occupants in terms of health risk and safety risk. Health risk is related to exposure of building factors that may generate further health problems while safety risks, create a tendency upon injury, death, crime or nuisance. Hence, this paper explores the impact of building performance failure to the occupants' health and safety risks, in accordance to the performance elements and criteria. The review demonstrates that there is a plethora of risk factors with the potential to affect the occupants in different dimensions of building performance. The coverage of the social aspects, health risk and safety risk, are therefore potentially influenced by the failure of performance criteria. ? 2018 Construction Research Institute of Malaysia.

Many menopausal women over 50 years of age lose their bone density and suffer bone fractures. In addition, many mortality and morbidity cases among the elderly are related to hip fracture. This study aims to investigate the effect of Lactobacillus helveticus (L. helveticus) on bone health status among ovariectomized (OVX) bone loss-induced rats. Methods: The rats were either OVX or sham OVX (sham), then were randomly assigned into three groups, G1: sham, G2: OVX and G3: OVX+L. helveticus (1 mL of 10 8 –10 9 colony forming units). The supplementation was force-fed to the rats once a day for 16 weeks while control groups were force-fed with demineralized water. Results: L. helveticus upregulated the expression of Runx2 and Bmp2, increased serum osteocalcin, bone volume/total volume and trabecular thickness, and decreased serum C-terminal telopeptide and total porosity percentage. It also altered bone microstructure, as a result increasing bone mineral density and bone strength. Conclusion: Our results indicate that L. helveticus attenuates bone remodeling and consequently improves bone health in OVX rats by increasing bone formation along with bone resorption reduction. This study suggests a potential therapeutic effect of L. helveticus (ATCC 27558) on postmenopausal osteoporosis. ? 2018 Parvaneh et al.",Bone loss; Bone mineral density; Lactobacillus helveticus; Osteoporosis; Ovariectomized rats,"bone morphogenetic protein 2; carboxy terminal telopeptide; osteocalcin; probiotic agent; transcription factor RUNX2; BMP2 protein, human; bone morphogenetic protein 2; RUNX2 protein, human; transcription factor RUNX2; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; Bmp2 gene; bone density; bone mass; bone strength; bone structure; colony forming unit; controlled study; female; gene expression regulation; Lactobacillus helveticus; nonhuman; ossification; osteolysis; ovariectomy; porosity; postmenopause osteoporosis; protein blood level; rat; Runx2 gene; supplementation; therapy effect; thickness; trabecular bone; upregulation; animal; bone; bone density; bone remodeling; drug effect; human; Lactobacillus helveticus; metabolism; osteolysis; ovariectomy; postmenopause osteoporosis; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Bone and Bones; Bone Density; Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; Bone Remodeling; Bone Resorption; Core Binding Factor Alpha 1 Subunit; Female; Humans; Lactobacillus helveticus; Osteoporosis, Postmenopausal; Ovariectomy; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Up-Regulation",2-s2.0-85056349988

The diseases are commonly treated with antibiotics. However, the bacteria had developed resistances to commonly used antibiotics making treatment a difficult task. Therefore, the continuous surveillance of susceptibility of Pseudomonas especially for the human pathogen P. aeruginosa to commonly clinical and aquaculture farming used antibiotics is important to ensure that serious infections remain susceptible to those antibiotics. Methodology and results: In this study, the bacteria were screened from water, sediment and fish from rivers and aquaculture farms around Kuching, Sarawak. A total number of 38 presumptive P. aeruginosa were isolated using CHROMagarTM Pseudomonas and subjected to a series of biochemical tests. Out of all the isolates tested, only two isolates designated as AS-R10(S) and BK2-OLT2(S) fulfilled the biochemical characteristics of P. aeruginosa. 16S rRNA gene sequencing further confirmed these two isolates as P. aeruginosa based on their 100% similarity with P. aeruginosa strain GD1 and P. aeruginosa strain PA1201 in NCBI database. These two isolates were tested for their susceptibilities against nine common antibiotics used in both clinical and aquaculture farming nowadays: imipenem, piperacillin, meropenem, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, tobramycin and norfloxacin according to CLSI standard using disk diffusion method. Conclusion, significance and impact of study: The two isolates exhibited total susceptibility to all the antibiotics analysed, suggesting the effectiveness of the antimicrobial agents towards P. aeruginosa isolated from aquaculture and water environment in the study area. ? 2018.",16S rRNA gene sequencing; Antibiotic susceptibilities; Aquaculture; P. aeruginosa,,2-s2.0-85055772100

A total of 98 patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis with Lenke 1/2 curves who underwent posterior spinal fusion between 2013 and 2014 with minimum follow-up of 2 years were recruited. Radiological parameters: UIV tilt angle, T1 tilt, cervical axis, and clavicle angle were measured preoperatively, postoperatively, and at final follow-up. Results. Mean age was 16.2±6.2 years. Mean follow-up was 37.9±6.5 months. There were 73.5% Lenke 1 and 26.5% Lenke 2 curves. Significant factors affecting postoperative T1 Tilt were postoperative UIV tilt angle, preoperative T1 tilt, and preoperative UIV tilt angle. Postoperative UIV tilt angle and preoperative cervical axis were significant factors affecting cervical axis at final follow-up.

There was strong correlation between postoperative UIV tilt angle and T1 tilt for the whole cohort (P<0.001), when UIV was at T2 (P<0.001), T3 (P<0.001), and T4 (P<0.001). Postoperative UIV tilt angle also had significant correlation with cervical axis when UIV was at T2 (P=0.021) and T3 (P=0.009). Conclusion. Postoperative UIV tilt angle was an independent factor, which had significant correlation with postoperative T1 tilt and cervical axis measurement. There was strong correlation between postoperative UIV tilt angle and T1 tilt for the whole cohort, when UIV was at T3 and T4. There was very strong correlation between postoperative UIV tilt angle and T1 tilt when UIV was at T2.

There is no sufficient literature on the effect of post location on endodontically treated pre-molar teeth with 2 roots.Objectives. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of fiber post location on fracture resistance and failure mode of endodontically treated premolars with 2 roots.Material and methods. Fifty extracted maxillary first premolars with 2 roots were divided randomly into 5 groups. Group 1 was comprised of sound teeth, which received only metal crowns (control). Teeth from groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 were decoronated 2 mm above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and were endodontically treated. No post was placed in group 2 teeth. Teeth from groups 3, 4 and 5 were given a fiber post placed in the buccal canal, palatal canal, and both buccal and palatal canals, respectively. All teeth in groups 2, 3, 4, and 5 were built up with composite and full coverage metal crowns. A compressive static load was applied at an angle of 25° to the crowns with a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min, until fracture.Results. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed significant differences among the groups (p = 0.002). A post hoc test showed significantly lower fracture resistance of group 4 compared to group 5 (p = 0.011). Furthermore, group 2 had significantly less fracture resistance compared to group 1 (p = 0.021) and group 5 (p = 0.002). According to Fisher’s exact test, different post locations are non-sig-nificantly associated with fracture mode (p = 0.256).Conclusions. Fiber post location has a significant effect on fracture resistance of severely damaged, endodontically treated maxillary premolars with 2 roots. However, post placement in the palatal root is preferred, as it maintains the restorability of the tooth. ? 2018 by Wroclaw Medical University.",Fiber post; Fracture mode; Fracture resistance; Maxillary premolars with 2 roots; Post location,"adhesive agent; epoxy resin; resin cement; root canal filling material; Article; buccolingual width; cementoenamel junction; controlled study; dental parameters; endodontic procedure; fracture load; fracture resistance; maxillary first premolar; medical parameters; mesiodistal width; mouth cavity; root length; tooth root; dental procedure; dental surgery; human; maxilla; premolar tooth; tooth crown; tooth fracture; tooth pulp disease; Bicuspid; Crowns; Dental Stress Analysis; Humans; Maxilla; Post and Core Technique; Tooth Fractures; Tooth Preparation, Prosthodontic; Tooth, Nonvital",2-s2.0-85055073541

However, clothing size as a proxy of adiposity in predicting postmenopausal breast cancer is not widely studied. We aimed to explore the relationships between postmenopausal breast cancer risk with adipose indicators (including clothing sizes) and weight change over adulthood. Design Prospective cohort study. Setting England, Wales and Scotland. Participants 17 781 postmenopausal women from the UK Women's Cohort Study. Primary outcome measure Incident cases of malignant breast cancers (International Classification of Diseases (ICD) 9 code 174 and ICD 10 code C50). Results From 282 277 person-years follow-up, there were 946 incident breast cancer cases with an incidence rate of 3.35 per 1000 women. Body mass index (HR: 1.04; 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.07), blouse size (HR: 1.10; 1.03 to 1.18), waist circumference (HR: 1.07; 1.01 to 1.14) and skirt size (HR: 1.14;1.06 to 1.22) had positive associations with postmenopausal breast cancer after adjustment for potential confounders. Increased weight over adulthood (HR: 1.02; 1.01 to 1.03) was also associated with increased risk for postmenopausal breast cancer. Conclusions Blouse and skirt sizes can be used as adipose indicators in predicting postmenopausal breast cancer.

We aimed to describe and compare the epidemiology, risk factors for mortality, and outcomes in extrapulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome. Design: This is a secondary analysis of a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study. Data on epidemiology, ventilation, therapies, and outcomes were collected and analyzed. Patients were classified into two mutually exclusive groups (extrapulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome) based on etiologies. Primary outcome was PICU mortality. Cox proportional hazard regression was used to identify risk factors for mortality. Setting: Ten multidisciplinary PICUs in Asia. Patients: Mechanically ventilated children meeting the Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Consensus Conference criteria for pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome between 2009 and 2015. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main Results: Forty-one of 307 patients (13.4%) and 266 of 307 patients (86.6%) were classified into extrapulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome groups, respectively. The most common causes for extrapulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome were sepsis (82.9%) and pneumonia (91.7%), respectively. Children with extrapulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome were older, had higher admission severity scores, and had a greater proportion of organ dysfunction compared with pulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome group. Patients in the extrapulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome group had higher mortality (48.8% vs 24.8%; p = 0.002) and reduced ventilator-free days (median 2.0 d [interquartile range 0.0-18.0 d] vs 19.0 d [0.5-24.0 d]; p = 0.001) compared with the pulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome group. After adjusting for site, severity of illness, comorbidities, multiple organ dysfunction, and severity of acute respiratory distress syndrome, extrapulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome etiology was not associated with mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.56 [95% CI, 0.90-2.71]). Conclusions: Patients with extrapulmonary pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome were sicker and had poorer clinical outcomes. However, after adjusting for confounders, it was not an independent risk factor for mortality.

Bone marrow-derived cells (BMDCs), a rich source of hematopoietic and mesenchymal stem cells, putatively contribute to this tumoral stroma. However their characteristics and roles within the tumor microenvironment are unclear. In the present study, BMDCs in the tumor microenvironment were traced using the green fluorescent protein (GFP) bone marrow transplantation model. Methods: C57BL/6 mice were irradiated and rescued by bone marrow transplantation from GFP-transgenic mice. Lewis lung cancer cells were inoculated into the mice to generate subcutaneous allograft tumors or lung metastases. Confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry for GFP, α-SMA, CD11b, CD31, CD34 and CD105, and double-fluorescent immunohistochemistry for GFP-CD11b, GFP-CD105 and GFP-CD31 were performed. Results: Round and dendritic-shaped GFP-positive mononuclear cells constituted a significant stromal subpopulation in primary tumor peripheral area (PA) and metastatic tumor area (MA) microenvironment, thus implicating an invasive and metastatic role for these cells. CD11b co-expression in GFP-positive cells suggests that round/dendritic cell subpopulations are possibly BM-derived macrophages. Identification of GFP-positive mononuclear infiltrates co-expressing CD31 suggests that these cells might be BM-derived angioblasts, whereas their non-reactivity for CD34, CD105 and α-SMA implies an altered vascular phenotype distinct from endothelial cells. Significant upregulation of GFP-positive, CD31-positive and GFP/CD31 double-positive cell densities positively correlated with PA and MA (P<0.05). Conclusion: Taken together, in vivo evidence of traceable GFP-positive BMDCs in primary and metastatic tumor microenvironment suggests that recruited BMDCs might partake in cancer invasion and metastasis, possess multilineage potency and promote angiogenesis. ?

Globally, it has been reported that the daily mortality rate during the neonatal period is much higher (30-fold) than the post-neonatal period. In the Eastern Mediterranean Region, about 40% of the under-5 mortality occurs in the neonatal period. This study aimed to explore the association between the socio-economic, demographic and perinatal care related factors, and the neonatal mortality in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Methods: The secondary data for the 1990 to 2013 on neonatal mortality rates, socio-demographic, socio-economic and health factors were extracted from official websites, including united nations children’s fund (UNICEF), world health organization (WHO), and united nations educational, scientific and cultural organization (UNESCO). Data were collected using the following keywords: ‘neonatal mortality’, ‘perinatal deaths’, ‘child health, education’, ‘expenditure on health’, ‘safe water’, ‘sanitation’ and ‘health in-dicators’. We used secondary data analysis to explore the relationship between the possible explanatory variables and neonatal mortality using correlation coefficient analysis. Results: There was a noticeable decline in neonatal mortality rates (NMR) among the Eastern Mediterranean countries from 1990 to 2013. The neonatal mortality rate had a negative and significant association with literacy status of both sexes, annual growth rates, antenatal care coverage, birth attendance by skilled health personnel, Gross National Income (GNI), total health expenditure per capita, safe drinking water and adequate sanitation facilities. However, the neonatal mortality rate had significant and positive relationships with maternal mortality ratio, total fertility rate, population size, total births and low birth weight. Conclusion: Despite the fall in the neonatal mortality rate, it remains high in the Eastern Mediterranean countries. Socioeconomic and other related factors appear to play a major role in determining neonatal mortality and there is an inverse relationship between socioeconomic status and the neonatal mortality rate. Neonatal health in Eastern Mediterranean countries needs a more effective and innovative approach to sustain the rapid progress in the overall reduction of child mortality. ? 2018, Iranian Journal of Pediatrics.",Eastern mediterranean region; Neonatal mortality; Socioeconomic factors,drinking water; child health; controlled study; demography; education; female; fertility; gross national income; growth rate; health care cost; health literacy; health status indicator; human; low birth weight; male; mortality rate; newborn; newborn mortality; perinatal care; population size; prenatal care; Review; sanitation; socioeconomics; Southern Europe; water quality,2-s2.0-85053392479

The respondents were randomly selected and were issued with a questionnaire. Results: The majority of the transtibial amputees were aware of stump contracture complications. It was found that they also preferred methods of prevention which required less effort, was cost-effective, and were also practical. Conclusion: More focus should be placed on contracture prevention methods which were most complied with by the patients. This is because the effectiveness of a prevention method is highly influenced by patients’ compliance with the method. Patients with a higher risk of developing stump contractures should be also given more attention in post-amputation care. ?Copyright 2018 by Turkish Society of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.",Awareness; Knee flexion contracture; Post-amputation care; Stump contracture; Transtibial amputee,adult; aged; Article; awareness; bone cancer; clinical article; cost effectiveness analysis; diabetes mellitus; exercise; female; human; injury; joint contracture; knee amputation; male; middle aged; neurologic disease; patient compliance; physiotherapy; young adult,2-s2.0-85053251829

Materials and Methods: A total of 47 patients with 88 IPS e.max Press single crowns were examined at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, using modified United States Public Health Service evaluation criteria (USPHS). These 88 crowned teeth included 19 vital and 69 nonvital teeth that were restored with different post and core materials. The periodontal status was compared using the plaque index (PI), gingival recession (GR), modified papillary bleeding index (MPBI) and probing pocket depth (PPD) between the crowned teeth and contralateral control (sound) teeth. Results: About 96.6% of the crowns exhibited satisfactory clinical performance. The mean survival rate at three years was 97.7%, and 100% at two years with a low incidence of fractures. There were no staitistically significant differences in the mean gingival recession (p = 0.182) and mean plaque scores (p = 0.102) between crowned and control teeth. The crowned teeth had higher mean MPBI (p = 0.000) and PPD (p = 0.051) compared to the contralateral sound teeth.

These pharmacological agents, though effective for the treatment of alcoholism, are not without shortcomings; such as abuse potential, serious mental and physical adverse effects, interaction with alcohol and also poor metabolism and excretion. As more is being understood about the neurobiology of alcohol addiction as well as the unique pharmacological action of these drugs, new agents are evaluated for potential benefits when used as an adjunct in combination therapy. This review article summarizes the novel pharmacotherapeutic approaches used in the treatment of alcohol addiction by focusing on the drugs, which include neramexane, gabapentin, baclofen, aripiprazole, nalmafene, and quetiapine. ? 2018 Bentham Science Publishers.",Alcohol; Aripiprazole; Baclofen; Gabapentin; Nalmafene; Neramexane; Quetiapine,alcohol; aripiprazole; baclofen; gabapentin; nalmefene; neramexane; quetiapine; aripiprazole; baclofen; cyclopentane derivative; drugs used in the treatment of addiction; gabapentin; nalmefene; naltrexone; neramexane; quetiapine; alcohol metabolism; alcoholism; drug mechanism; excretion; human; neurobiology; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; alcoholism; animal; Alcohol Deterrents; Alcoholism; Animals; Aripiprazole; Baclofen; Cyclopentanes; Gabapentin; Humans; Naltrexone; Quetiapine Fumarate,2-s2.0-85052205421

Children at risk of post-operative respiratory complications are recommended to be monitored in paediatric intensive care unit (PICU). The aim of the study is to review the risk factors for post-operative complications and admissions to PICU. Methods: A review of medical records of children who underwent adenotonsillectomy between January 2011 and December 2014 was performed. Association between demographic variables and post-operative complications were examined using chi-square and Mann–Whitney tests. Results: A total of 214 children were identified, and of these, 19 (8.8%) experienced post-operative complications. Six children (2.8%) had respiratory complications: hypoxaemia in four and laryngospasm requiring reintubation in a further two. Both of the latter patients were extubated upon arrival to PICU and required no escalation of therapy. A total of 13 (6.1%) children had non-respiratory complications: 8 (3.7%) had infection and 5 (2.3%) had haemorrhage. A total of 26 (12.1%) children were electively admitted to PICU and mean stay was 19.5 (SD ± 13) h. No association between demographic characteristics, comorbid conditions or polysomnographic parameters and post-operative complications were noted. A total of 194 (90.7%) children stayed only one night in hospital (median 1 day, range 1–5 days). Conclusion: The previously identified risk factors and criteria for PICU admission need revision, and new recommendations are necessary. ? 2017 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).",Adenotonsillectomy; Complication; Obstructive sleep apnoea; Post-operative,"adenotonsillar hypertrophy; adenotonsillectomy; adolescent; adult; Article; asthma; bleeding; child; clinical outcome; comorbidity; extubation; female; hospital admission; human; hypoxemia; infection; intubation; larynx spasm; length of stay; major clinical study; male; pediatric intensive care unit; polysomnography; postoperative complication; postoperative period; preoperative period; priority journal; reintubation; reliability; respiratory tract disease; retrospective study; risk; risk factor; tonsillar bleeding; tonsillar infection; adenoidectomy; outcome assessment; postoperative complication; preoperative period; preschool child; respiratory tract disease; tonsillectomy; Adenoidectomy; Adolescent; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Intensive Care Units, Pediatric; Male; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Patient Admission; Postoperative Complications; Preoperative Period; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Tonsillectomy",2-s2.0-85051734873

We aimed to identify the predictive factors for HPA axis recovery after prolonged glucocorticoid use. Methods: Retrospective review of patients who had undergone first short Synacthen test (SST) to assess HPA axis recovery after prolonged use of glucocorticoids. Results: A total of 61% (20/33) of patients had adequate SST response at a median time of 2 years after diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Those who had adequate response during SST had higher ambulatory early morning cortisol (P<.01), shorter duration of exposure to glucocorticoids (P = .01), and lower final cumulative hydrocortisone replacement dose (P = .03). Age, gender, body mass index, indications for glucocorticoid use, and basal adrenocorticotropic hormone levels were not predictive of HPA axis recovery. On multivariate analysis, ambulatory early morning cortisol was the only independent predictor of adequate SST response (odds ratio, 1.02; 95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.04; P = .02). Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, ambulatory early morning cortisol of 8.8 μg/dL predicted a positive SST response with a sensitivity of 70% and specificity of 93%. Conclusion: Early morning ambulatory cortisol could be used to decide on timely SST in order to prevent complications from unnecessary replacement with glucocorticoids. ? 2018 AACE.",,corticotropin; dexamethasone; glucocorticoid; hydrocortisone; serum albumin; tetracosactide; glucocorticoid; Addison disease; adrenal insufficiency; adult; age; Article; body mass; body weight gain; chemoluminescence; Cushing syndrome; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; fragility fracture; gender; human; hydrocortisone blood level; hypertension; hyponatremia; hypothalamus hypophysis adrenal system; major clinical study; male; middle aged; obesity; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; sensitivity and specificity; aged; chemically induced; convalescence; hypophysis adrenal system; hypothalamus hypophysis system; metabolism; multivariate analysis; pathophysiology; prognosis; Adrenal Insufficiency; Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; Aged; Female; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Hydrocortisone; Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pituitary-Adrenal System; Prognosis; Recovery of Function; Retrospective Studies,2-s2.0-85048889682

Background: No study has directly compared the risk factors associated with subclinical coronary atherosclerosis and CRA. Study: This was a cross-sectional study using multinomial logistic regression analysis of 4859 adults who participated in a health screening examination (2010 to 2011; analysis 2014 to 2015). CAC scores were categorized as 0, 1 to 100, or >100. Colonoscopy results were categorized as absent, low-risk, or high-risk CRA. Results: The prevalence of CAC>0, CAC 1 to 100 and >100 was 13.0%, 11.0%, and 2.0%, respectively. The prevalence of any CRA, low-risk CRA, and high-risk CRA was 15.1%, 13.0%, and 2.1%, respectively.

Similarly, the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence interval) for any CRA comparing participants with CAC 1 to 100 and CAC>100 with those with no CAC were 1.26 (1.00-1.6) and 2.07 (1.31-3.26), respectively. Age, smoking, diabetes, and family history of CRC were significantly associated with both conditions. Conclusions: We observed a graded association between CAC and CRA in apparently healthy individuals. The coexistence of both conditions further emphasizes the need for more evidence of comprehensive approaches to screening and the need to consider the impact of the high risk of coexisting disease in individuals with CAC or CRA, instead of piecemeal approaches restricted to the detection of each disease independently. ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Anaemia is common among the elderly, yet it remains an underresearched clinical condition. This study investigates ethnic differences in prevalence of anaemia and identifies potential factors associated with anaemia in the elderly. Methods. Data from the National Health & Morbidity Survey (NHMS) 2015 conducted by Ministry of Health was analyzed. Haemoglobin levels were measured using point-of-care testing, HemoCue? Hb 201+ System ?, from consenting individuals. Demographic information and other clinical information were obtained through a structured questionnaire. Descriptive and multivariate analyses were conducted and significant results were presented as adjusted odds ratio. Results. A total of 3794 participants aged 60 years and older responded to the anaemia module with a response rate of 93.7%. 64.0% of respondents were of Malay ethnicity, 21.6% were Chinese, 6.1% were Indians, and 8.3% were of other ethnicities. The overall prevalence of anaemia among older people was 35.3%. The highest prevalence of anaemia was found among respondents of Indian ethnicity (45.5%). The Indian (aOR: 1.72; 95% CI 1.26-2.34) and Malay (aOR: 1.25; 95% CI 1.04-1.49) ethnic groups were more likely to be anaemic in comparison to those of Chinese ethnicity. Anaemia in older people was also associated with increasing age, history of hospital admission, and the presence of diabetes mellitus. Conclusion. Anaemia in the elderly is associated with Indian and Malay ethnicities, increasing age, hospitalization, and diabetes.

TGF-β is dual functional in development of cancer. In early stages of tumour development, TGF-β plays tumour suppressive, and as tumour progressed, TGF-β is an oncogenic factor. Functioning as tumour suppressor, TGF-β is a potential growth inhibitor. Cancerous cells show high sensitivity to TGF-β inhibition either by depletion of TGF-β signalling components in genetic level or by perturbation of downstream signalling proteins in protein level. Intense investigations had revealed that Smad proteins constitute as core components of TGF-β intracellular cascades. Typical development of cancer often contains production of excess TGF-β which accelerates the invasion and metastasis as well as inhibiting the anti-tumoural immune responses. In order to design optimal approaches in cancer therapeutic regimes, comprehending the oncogenic function of TGF-β and function of its downstream proteins (Smads) are required. The approaches must be in the direction of inhibition of those TGF-β functions which induce metastasis phenotypes, but at the same time preserve its growth inhibitory effects. To date several anti-cancer drugs such as Genistein and several microRNAs such as microRNA-452, demonstrated the new insights in induction of tumour suppressive potential of TGF-β signalling pathways among various cancer types. ?

The present study aimed to optimize the conditions for the production of adventitious roots from B. rotunda on Murashige and Skoog (MS) solid medium. The effects of the MS strength and sucrose concentration on adventitious root growth were studied as well as the production of pinostrobin. Adventitious roots were initiated from bud explant of B. rotunda, on MS solid medium supplemented with 2.0 mg/L 1-Naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and were used to establish root suspension cultures. The optimum biomasses of 1.83 ± 0.21 g fresh weight were obtained with a 1/2 strength of MS medium. High pinostrobin production (3.54 mg/g) was obtained with 50 g/L of sucrose concentration. These results suggest that adventitious root cultures are suitable for the raw material for the large-scale production, which contain a high yield of the pinostrobin compound. The results also revealed that the culture condition is a good strategy for enhancing the pinostrobin content in the adventitious root cultures. ?

Coronary revascularization in chronic total occlusion (CTO) is associated with improved clinical outcomes. The choice of the coronary stent is crucial in maintaining long-term vessel patency after CTO revascularization. We investigated the efficacy and safety of polymer-free ultrathin strut sirolimus-probucol coated drug-eluting stents (PF-SES) for CTO lesions. Methods. Patients with CTO lesions treated with PF-SES were identified from the prospective multicenter international ISAR 2000 registry. The primary endpoint was clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) at 9 months. Secondary endpoints were 9-month major adverse cardiac events (death, myocardial infarction, or TLR) (MACE) and the occurrence of stent thrombosis. Results. A total of 111 patients with CTO lesions (n=127) were available for analysis. The 9-month clinical follow-up rate was 91%. The mean reference vessel diameter and lesion length were 2.76 mm ± 0.40 and 26.8 mm ± 13.1, respectively. The overall DAPT duration was 9.7 ± 2.8 months. Only one (1%) in-hospital MI was reported. The TLR and MACE rates at 9 months were 2% (2/101) and 5.9% (6/101), respectively. The 9-month accumulated rates of definite or probable stent thrombosis was 0% (0/101). Conclusion.

However, the prevalence of CAD in males is higher than in females and mortality rates are also different between the two genders. This suggest that risk factors associated with mortality between males and females are different, so we compared the clinical characteristics and outcome between male and female STEMI patients. OBJECTIVES: To identify the risk factors associated with mortality for each gender and compare differences, if any, among ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. DESIGN: Retrospective analysis. SETTINGS: Hospitals across Malaysia. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data on all STEMI patients in the National Cardiovascular Database-Acute coronary syndrome (NCVD-ACS) registry for the years 2006 to 2013 (8 years). We collected demographic and risk factor data (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, smoking status, dyslipidaemia and family history of CAD). Significant variables from the univariate analysis were further analysed by a multivariate logistic analysis to identify risk factors and compare by gender. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differential risk factors for each gender. RESULTS: For the 19 484 patients included in the analysis, the mortality rate over the 8 years was significantly higher in females (15.4%) than males (7.5%) (P<.001). The univariate analysis showed that the majority of male patients <65 years while females were ?65 years. The most prevalent risk factors for male patients were smoking (79.3%), followed by hypertension (54.9%) and diabetes mellitus (40.4%), while the most prevalent risk factors for female patients were hypertension (76.8%), followed by diabetes mellitus (60%) and dyslipidaemia (38.1%). The final model for male STEMI patients had seven significant variables: Killip class, age group, hypertension, renal disease, percutaneous coronary intervention and family history of CVD. For female STEMI patients, the significant variables were renal disease, smoking status, Killip class and age group. CONCLUSION: Gender differences existed in the baseline characteristics, associated risk factors, clinical presentation and outcomes among STEMI patients. For STEMI females, the rate of mortality was twice that of males. Once they reach menopausal age, when there is less protection from the estrogen hormone and there are other risk factors, menopausal females are at increased risk for STEMI.

However, this association is unclear in Malaysian population. Therefore, this study investigated the association of STK15 Phe31Ile and Val57Ile polymorphisms to GIC risk in Malaysia. Genomic DNA was extracted from 185 GIC patients and 1110 healthy controls and was subjected to polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. SNPs were further confirmed using sequencing. We found that the 31Phe allele and 31Phe/Phe genotype in the Phe31Ile SNP significantly increased GIC risk in Malaysian population, particularly in gastric cancer (p<0.017). The combined analysis for both SNPs also increased the risk of GIC in this study. Etiological factors such as age, gender and ethnicity were not associated with GIC in the population. This is the first study to report the association of STK15 Phe31Ile and Val57Ile SNPs with an increased risk of GIC in Malaysians; the 31Phe allele is exclusively associated with the risk of gastric cancer. In addition, GIC incidences among Malaysians have significantly shifted to a younger age (<50 years).",Gastrointestinal cancer; Malaysian population; STK15 polymorphisms,cancer; digestive system disorder; DNA; gene; genomics; genotype; health risk; polymorphism; risk factor; Malaysia,2-s2.0-85041892064

More than 63% of respondents were unable to recall any warning signs and 66.7% were unable to recall any risk factors. Respondents scored considerably higher on recognition rather than on recall for both the warning signs and the risk factors of cervical cancer. Recall and recognition of cervical cancer symptoms and risk factors were higher in women who had a higher level of education and who earned a higher income.

Binary fission has been widely accepted as the plausible mode of reproduction for this parasite. The present study demonstrates that subjecting the parasites in vitro to higher temperature shows the proliferation of parasite numbers in cultures. Transmission electron microscopy was used to compare the morphology of Blastocystis sp. subtype 3 isolated from a dengue patient having high fever (in vivo thermal stress) and Blastocystis sp. 3 maintained at 41?°C (in vitro thermal stress) and 37?°C (control). Fluorescence stains like acridine orange (AO) and 4′,6′-diamino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) were used to demonstrate the viability and nuclear content of the parasite for both the in vitro and in vivo thermal stress groups of parasites. Blastocystis sp. at 37?°C was found to be mostly vacuolar whereas the in vitro thermal stressed isolates at 41?°C were granular with electron dense material seen to protect the granules within the central body. Parasites of the in vivo thermal stressed group showed similar ultrastructure as the in vitro ones. AO and DAPI staining provided evidence that these granules are viable which develop into progenies of Blastocystis sp. These granular forms were then observed to rupture and release progenies from the mother cells whilst the peripheral cytoplasmic walls were seen to degrade. Upon exposure to high temperature both in vitro and in vivo, Blastocystis sp. in cultures show higher number of granular forms seen to be protected by the electron dense material within the central body possibly acting as a protective mechanism. This is possibly to ensure the ability to survive for the granules to be developed as viable progenies for release into the host system. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Blastocystis sp; Fluorescence; Granular form; Progenies; Thermal stress; Ultrastructure,"acridine orange; nonstructural protein 1; 2-phenylindole; indole derivative; adult; Article; Blastocystis; cell granule; cell ultrastructure; comparative study; controlled study; dengue; electron microscopy; fever; fluorescence; human; in vitro study; in vivo study; osmotic stress; priority journal; temperature stress; time-lapse microscopy; transmission electron microscopy; animal; Blastocystis; blastocystosis; cell proliferation; dengue; diarrhea; feces; heat shock response; isolation and purification; parasitology; physiology; reproduction; ultrastructure; Acridine Orange; Adult; Animals; Blastocystis; Blastocystis Infections; Cell Proliferation; Dengue; Diarrhea; Feces; Heat-Shock Response; Humans; Indoles; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Reproduction",2-s2.0-85035313831

Therefore, an accurate monitoring of the blood glucose level seems to play a major role in the diagnosis and management of diabetes mellitus. Carbon nanotube (CNT) is one of the most promising materials widely used in this area due to its electrical properties. Beside glucose monitoring for diabetes, the biosensors array for the electronic tongue has also become an important area of research. Generally, an electronic tongue is a single or multisensory device dedicated to the automated analysis of complex composition samples and recognizes their characteristic taste properties. This chapter introduces the synthesis method, optimization approach, properties, and electrochemical applications of the CNTs-based glucose biosensor. Furthermore, the significance of the electrochemical glucose biosensor in both medical application and glucose-based electronic tongue is discussed in detail. ? 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.",,,2-s2.0-85032590504

The importance of the relationship becomes highlighted when IEQ has a strong influence to change people beliaviour tlirough its nature specifically in places like an office building where the productivity of occupants remains at the top of everything. In this regard, this manuscript documented the parameters of the indoor environment quality which lias a strong influence on occupants’ comfort. Through critical review of literature, it has been found that IEQ parameters as thermal, noise, light and air quality could strongly affect the human comfort and health while having a critical role in energy consumption in the building. Moreover, there is a complicated relation among IEQ parameters which make it difficult for a designer to find a balance among them regarding occupants’ comfort and productivity and this complication is more confusing in green construction. Many post occupancy evaluation (POE) studies in both conventional and green buildings have carried out, but almost none of them indicated a full satisfaction with IEQ parameters simultaneously. Therefore, this paper investigated among IEQ parameters and their correlation with each other pertaining to occupants’ satisfaction, health and productivity in office buildings with different methods of construction. ? 2017, University of Malaya.

Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of available oral therapeutic options (aspirin, warfarin, direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs)) for extended thromboprophylaxis in adults with a first unprovoked VTE, to prevent VTE recurrence after completion of an acceptable initial oral anticoagulant treatment period, as defined in individual studies. Search methods: For this review, the Cochrane Vascular Information Specialist (CIS) searched the Specialised Register (March 2017) as well as the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL; 2017, Issue 2). We also searched trials registries (March 2017) and reference lists of relevant articles. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials in which patients with a first, symptomatic, objectively confirmed, unprovoked VTE, who had been initially treated with anticoagulants, were randomised to extended prophylaxis (vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), antiplatelet agents, or DOACs) versus no prophylaxis or placebo. We also included trials that compared one type of extended prophylaxis versus another type of extended prophylaxis. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently selected studies, assessed quality, and extracted data. We resolved disagreements by discussion. Main results: Six studies with a combined total of 3436 participants met the inclusion criteria. Five studies compared extended prophylaxis versus placebo: three compared warfarin versus placebo, and two compared aspirin versus placebo. One study compared one type of extended prophylaxis (rivaroxaban) versus another type of extended prophylaxis (aspirin). For extended prophylaxis versus placebo, we downgraded the quality of the evidence for recurrent VTE and all-cause mortality to moderate owing to concerns arising from risks of selection and performance bias in individual studies. For all other outcomes in this review, we downgraded the quality of the evidence to low owing to concerns arising from risk of bias for the studies stated above, combined with concerns over imprecision. For extended prophylaxis versus other extended prophylaxis, we downgraded the quality of the evidence for recurrent VTE and major bleeding to moderate owing to concerns over imprecision. Risk of bias in the individual study was low. Meta-analysis showed that extended prophylaxis was no more effective than placebo in preventing VTE-related mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.14 to 6.98; 1862 participants; 4 studies; P = 0.98; low-quality evidence), recurrent VTE (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.03; 2043 participants; 5 studies; P = 0.07; moderate-quality evidence), major bleeding (OR 1.84, 95% CI 0.87 to 3.85; 2043 participants; 5 studies; P = 0.86; low-quality evidence), all-cause mortality (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.57; 2043 participants; 5 studies; P = 0.99; moderate-quality evidence), clinically relevant non-major bleeding (OR 1.78, 95% CI 0.59 to 5.33; 1672 participants; 4 studies; P = 0.30; low-quality evidence), stroke (OR 1.15, 95% CI 0.39 to 3.46; 1224 participants; 2 studies; P = 0.80; low-quality evidence), or myocardial infarction (OR 1.00, 95% CI 0.35 to 2.87; 1495 participants; 3 studies; P = 1.00; low-quality evidence). One study showed that the novel oral anticoagulant rivaroxaban was associated with fewer recurrent VTEs than aspirin (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.54; 1389 participants; P = 0.0001; moderate-quality evidence). Data show no clear differences in the incidence of major bleeding between rivaroxaban and aspirin (OR 3.06, 95% CI 0.37 to 25.51; 1389 participants; P = 0.30; moderate-quality evidence) nor in the incidence of clinically relevant non-major bleeding (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.94; 1389 participants; 1 study; P = 0.69; moderate-quality evidence). Data on VTE-related mortality, all-cause mortality, stroke, and myocardial infarction were not yet available for participants with unprovoked VTE and will be incorporated in future versions of the review. Authors' conclusions: Evidence is currently insufficient to permit definitive conclusions concerning the effectiveness and safety of extended thromboprophylaxis in prevention of recurrent VTE after initial oral anticoagulation therapy among participants with unprovoked VTE.

We aim to compare the performance of Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and Chronic Kidney Disease-Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations in the multi-ethnic population attending University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC). Methods: This is a cross-sectional study recruiting patients, who attend UMMC Nephrology clinics on voluntary basis. 51-Chromium EDTA (51Cr-EDTA) plasma level was used to measure the reference GFR. The serum creatinine was determined by IDMS reference modified Jaffe kinetic assay (CrJaffe). The predictive capabilities of MDRD and CKD-EPI based equations were calculated. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20 and correlation, bias, precision and accuracy were determined. Results: A total of 113 subjects with mean age of 58.12 ± 14.76 years and BMI of 25.99 ± 4.29 kg/m2 were recruited. The mean reference GFR was 66.98 ± 40.65 ml/min/1.73m2, while the estimated GFR based on MDRD and CKD-EPI formula were 62.17 ± 40.40, and 60.44 ± 34.59, respectively. Both MDRD and CKD-EPI were well-correlated with reference GFR (0.806 and 0.867 respectively) and statistically significant with p &lt; 0.001. In the overall cohort, although MDRD had smaller bias than CKD-EPI (4.81 vs. 6.54), CKD-EPI was more precise (25.22 vs. 20.29) with higher accuracy within 30% of measured GFR (79.65 vs. 86.73%). Conclusion: The CKD-EPI equation appeared to be more precise and accurate than the MDRD equation in estimating GFR in our cohort of multi-ethnic populations in Malaysia. ? 2017 The Author(s).",CKD-EPI; Comparison; Glomerular filtration rate; MDRD,"creatinine; edetate chromium cr 51; calcium chelating agent; creatinine; edetic acid; accuracy; adolescent; adult; African American; Article; assessment of humans; Black person; Caucasian; Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration equation; clinical assessment; cohort analysis; comparative study; controlled study; creatinine blood level; cross-sectional study; data analysis software; diagnostic test accuracy study; disease classification; female; glomerulus filtration rate; human; human cell; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; Malaysian; male; middle aged; Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation; predictive value; race difference; sex difference; aged; chronic kidney failure; dimensional measurement accuracy; glomerulus filtration rate; kidney function test; Malaysia; pathophysiology; procedures; reproducibility; Aged; Calcium Chelating Agents; Creatinine; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dimensional Measurement Accuracy; Edetic Acid; Female; Glomerular Filtration Rate; Humans; Kidney Function Tests; Malaysia; Middle Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Reproducibility of Results",2-s2.0-85037979485

The deposit is also a prime target for power generation by the Nigerian government. Protection of man and the environment from excessive radiation exposures due to anthropogenic activities is, therefore, important. Purpose: The main objective of this study is the assessment of natural radioactivity in the Maiganga coalfield environment of north-eastern Nigeria, with particular emphasis on their environmental and human health implications. Methods: Samples of soil, coal, and mine tailings from Maiganga coalfield were assessed for 40K, 226Ra, and 232Th activity concentrations using HPGe γ-ray spectrometry. Results: Mean activity concentrations of 40K, 226Ra, and 232Th in coal were 17.8?±?1.2, 7.6?±?0.5, and 5.5?±?0.4, Bq?kg?1, respectively, which were below world mean values of 50, 20, and 20?Bq?kg?1, respectively, for coals.

Methods: This was aprospective cross-sectional observational study of hospital-based diabetic outpatients in Malaysia. Subjects were interviewed for their demographic data and medical history. The painDETECT questionnaire was used to screen for neuropathic pain symptoms and pain intensity was assessed using the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS). Neuropathy symptoms and signs were assessed using the Neuropathy Symptom Score (NSS) and Neuropathy Disability Score (NDS). Results:Of 242 patients,140 (58%) were women, with a mean age of 61 + 11.4 years (range 21 to 81). Ninety nine(40.9%) were Malay, 64 (26.4%) Chinese, 76 (31.4%) Indian and three (1.2%) were Eurasian. Mean duration of diabetes was 15.9+ 9.8 years (range 1 to 53) and 232 (95.9%) patients had Type II diabetes. Peripheral neuropathy,based on NSS and NDS criteria, was found in 83 (34.3%).

Methods: All the patients with spinal TB admitted in the two largest tertiary hospitals in Kuala Lumpur from 2009 to 2017 were recruited, the clinical features were documented, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine was performed. Clinical outcome was assessed with Modified Rankin scale (MRS). Results: Twenty two patients were recruited. This was out of 70 TB meningitis patients (31.4%) seen over the same period. Eighteen (81.8%) patients had concomitant TB meningitis. The clinical features consisted of systemic symptoms with fever (63.6%), meningitis symptoms with altered sensorium (45.5%), myelopathy with paraparesis (36.4%).

The Asian Collaborative Longitudinal Optic Neuritis Epidemiology (ACLONE) is an observational cohort study that assessed the risk of recurrent optic neuritis and/or progression of further neurologic events, either MS or neuromyelitis optica (NMO) in Asian patients with first-ever optic neuritis. Secondary aims were to study the presenting characteristics and visual outcome, and to identify risk factors for development of either MS or NMO. A total of 112 patients (25 men and 87 women) aged from 12 to 61 years were recruited from Singapore, Taiwan, South Korea and Malaysia. Of these, 94 (84%) had unilateral optic neuritis, with the right eye involved in 45 patients and the left eye in 49 patients and the remaining 18 (16%) had bilateral optic neuritis. Follow up data was available for 104 patients, and patients were followed for a median duration of 25.9 months. Of these patients, 6 patients were adjudicated to have reached the primary endpoint (composite of MS/NMO and optic neuritis): 3 patients with recurrent optic neuritis also subsequently experienced neurologic symptoms, and 3 patients without recurrent eye involvement had neurologic symptoms. Only one patient was considered to have prototypical MS, the other 5 were diagnosed with NMO, all with subsequent antibody confirmation. Optic neuritis in Asian patients has significantly different presenting characteristics from the classic description. However, in the majority of the patients it is usually a benign disease, with good visual outcome and no further events. ? 2017, ASEAN Neurological Association.

Since it is a treatable condition, a greater understanding of factors contributing to health-seeking behaviour is needed in order to plan effective provision of services. Methods: A survey of 1000 patients and accompanying relatives, visiting general surgical and obstetrics and gynaecology clinics for matters unrelated to FI, was conducted at University Malaya Medical Centre between January 2009 and February 2010. A follow-up regression analysis of the 83 patients who had FI, to identify factors associated with health-seeking behaviour, was performed. Variables identified through univariate analysis were subjected to multivariate analysis to determine independence. Reasons for not seeking treatment were also analysed. Results: Only eight patients (9.6%) had sought medical treatment. On univariate analysis, the likelihood of seeking treatment was significantly higher among patients who had more severe symptoms (OR 30.0, p=0.002), had incontinence to liquid stool (OR 3.83, p=0.002) or when there was an alteration to lifestyle (OR: 17.34; p<0.001). Nevertheless, the only independently-associated variable was alteration in lifestyle. Common reasons given for not seeking treatment was that the condition did not affect patients’ daily activities (88.0%), “social taboo” (5.3%) and “other” reasons (6.7%). Conclusions: Lifestyle alteration is the main driver of health-seeking behaviour in FI. However, the majority do not seek treatment. Greater public and physician-awareness on FI and available treatment options is needed. ? 2017, Malaysian Medical Association.

Phosphate has many roles in physiological functions, thus the depletion of serum phosphate could lead to impairment in multiple organ systems, which include the respiratory, cardiovascular, neurological and muscular systems and haematological and metabolic functions. Hypophosphataemia is defined as plasma phosphate level below 0.80 mmol per litre (mmol/L) and can be further divided into subgroups of mild (plasma phosphate of 0.66 to 0.79 mmol/L), moderate (plasma phosphate of 0.32 to 0.65 mmol/L) and severe (plasma phosphate of less than 0.32 mmol/L). The causes of hypophosphataemia include inadequate phosphate intake, decreased intestinal absorption, gastrointestinal or renal phosphate loss, and redistribution of phosphate into cells. Symptomatic hypophosphataemia associated with haematological malignancies has been reported infrequently. We report here a case of asymptomatic severe hypophosphataemia in a child with acute T-cell lymphoblastic leukaemia. A 14-year-old Chinese boy was diagnosed to have acute T cell lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). His serum biochemistry results were normal except inorganic phosphate and lactate dehydrogenase levels. The serum inorganic phosphate level was 0.1mmol/L and the level was low on repeated analysis. The child had no symptoms related to low phosphate levels. The possible causes of low phosphate were ruled out and urine Tmp/GFR was normal. Chemotherapy regime was started and the serum phosphate levels started to increase. Hypophosphataemia in leukaemia was attributed to shift of phosphorus into leukemic cells and excessive cellular phosphate consumption by rapidly proliferating cells. Several reports of symptomatic hypophosphataemia in myelogenous and lymphoblastic leukaemia in adults have been reported. To our knowledge this is the first case of severe asymptomatic hypophosphataemia in a child with ALL. ? 2017, Malaysian Society of Pathologists.

This fact enables researchers to study and examine implementation of a psychotherapy model at Shifaul Qalbi (House of Shiqal) in recovering mental disorders due to the effect of drug addiction. Shifaul Qalbi applies the IMEJ (Iman, Mental, Emosi and Jasmani) (Faith, Mental, Emotion and Physics) psychotherapy model. Through this model, the recovery process can run optimally. IMEJ is synergetic formulation. These four components are integrated implemented. Faithful patients must have a healthy mental condition, controlled emotion, and strong physics. IMEJ is very essential and in line with the mental stages known as Jujur, Amanah, Tanggungjawab, dan Ikhlas (JATI) (honest, trustworthy, responsible and sincere). House of Shiqal prioritizes awareness and sincerity for its operation. The awareness and sincerity of the therapist makes the house succeed in recovering more than 92% of 1,000 patients that have been recovered from drug abuse since 2008.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the treatment outcomes of substituting antiretroviral regimen in virologically suppressed HIV-infected patients in non-clinical trial settings in Asian countries. Methods: The study population consisted of HIV-infected patients enrolled in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD). Individuals were included in this analysis if they started combination antiretroviral treatment (cART) after 2002, were being treated at a centre that documented a median rate of viral load monitoring ?0.8 tests/patient/year among TAHOD enrolees, and experienced a minor or major treatment substitution while on virally suppressive cART. The primary endpoint to evaluate outcomes was clinical or virological failure (VF), followed by an ART class change. Clinical failure was defined as death or an AIDS diagnosis. VF was defined as confirmed viral load measurements ?400 copies/mL followed by an ART class change within six months. Minor regimen substitutions were defined as within-class changes and major regimen substitutions were defined as changes to a drug class. The patterns of substitutions and rate of clinical or VF after substitutions were analyzed. Results: Of 3994 adults who started ART after 2002, 3119 (78.1%) had at least one period of virological suppression. Among these, 1170 (37.5%) underwent a minor regimen substitution, and 296 (9.5%) underwent a major regimen substitution during suppression. The rates of clinical or VF were 1.48/100 person years (95% CI 1.14 to 1.91) in the minor substitution group, 2.85/100 person years (95% CI 1.88 to 4.33) in the major substitution group and 2.53/100 person years (95% CI 2.20 to 2.92) among patients that did not undergo a treatment substitution. Conclusions: The rate of clinical or VF was low in both major and minor substitution groups, showing that regimen substitution is generally effective in non-clinical trial settings in Asian countries. ? 2017 The Authors.

For example, the Malaysian population has large ethnic diversity and high prevalence of genetic disorders such as hemoglobinopathies and metabolic disorders. Increased morbidity and mortality from such diseases have a direct impact on society and health system sustainability and for this, decision-making becomes of outmost importance. We report here on our findings on the landscape of genomic testing and genetic counseling services in Malaysia. We first defined the framework of all Malaysian stakeholders that offer genomics services and next, we identified the related information gaps, as depicted through the service providers' online websites. Our research framework revealed that there is a very diverse spectrum of genomics services in Malaysia, in which wet- and dry-laboratory services integrate. Moreover, we identify the current gaps and possible remedies to improve the quality of genomic and predictive analytics, not to mention considerations to ensure robust ethics and responsible innovation. To our knowledge, this is the first such study to be performed for a Southeast Asian country.

Previous studies have shown the upregulation of dystrophin protein in Macrobrachium rosenbergii (the giant freshwater prawn) upon white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection. The literature has also suggested the important role of calcium ion alterations in causing such muscle diseases. Thus, the interest of this study lies within the linkage between dystrophin functioning, intracellular calcium and white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) infection condition. Methods In this study, the dystrophin gene from M. rosenbergii (MrDys) was first characterised followed by the characterization of dystrophin gene from a closely related shrimp species, Penaeus monodon (PmDys). Dystrophin sequences from different phyla were then used for evolutionary comparison through BLAST analysis, conserved domain analysis and phylogenetic analysis. The changes in mRNA expression levels of dystrophin and the alteration of intracellular calcium concentrations in WSSV infected muscle cells were then studied. Results A 1246 base pair long dystrophin sequence was identified in the giant freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium rosenbergii (MrDys) followed by 1082 base pair long dystrophin sequence in P. monodon (PmDys). Four conserved domains were identified from the thirteen dystrophin sequences compared which were classified into 5 different phyla. From the phylogenetic analysis, aside from PmDys, the characterised MrDys was shown to be most similar to the invertebrate phylum of Nematoda. In addition, an initial down-regulation of dystrophin gene expression followed by eventual up-regulation, together with an increase in intracellular calcium concentration [Ca2+]i were shown upon WSSV experimental infection. Discussion Both the functionality of the dystrophin protein and the intracellular calcium concentration were affected by WSSV infection which resulted in progressive muscle degeneration. An increased understanding of the role of dystrophin-calcium in MrDys and the interactions between these two components is necessary to prevent or reduce occurrences of muscle degeneration caused by WSSV infection, thereby reducing economic losses in the prawn farming industry from such disease. ? 2017",Immunology; Infectious disease,,2-s2.0-85036631357

A cross-sectional study was carried out among five rural communities in Malaysia to determine the prevalence of Giardia duodenalis in humans, animals and river water. Fecal samples collected from humans and animals were examined by light microscopy. Water was sampled from the rivers adjacent to the target communities and investigated for the occurrence of Giardia cysts. The isolated cysts were further genotyped targeting the glutamate dehydrogenase and triosephosphate isomerase genes. The overall prevalence of G. duodenalis was 6.7% (18/269) and 4.7% (8/169) among humans and animals, respectively. Giardia cysts (mean concentration range: 0.10–5.97 cysts/L) were also found in adjacent rivers at four out of the five villages examined. At Kemensah and Kuala Pangsun, Giardia cysts were isolated from humans [rate: 3.7% each (of 54 each)], animals [rates: 6.3% (of 62) and 11.3% (of 16), respectively] and river water [average concentration of 9 samples each: 0.83 ± 0.81 and 5.97 ± 7.00, respectively]. For both villages at Pos Piah and Paya Lebar, 12.2% (of 98) and 6.1% (of 33) of collected human samples were infected, respectively whilst none of the collected animals samples in these villages were found to be positive. The river water samples of these two villages were also contaminated (average concentration: 0.20 ± 0.35 (of 9) and 0.10 ± 0.19 (of 3), respectively). In conclusion, Giardia cysts were simultaneously observed in the human-animal-environment (i.e., river water) interfaces in at least two of five studied communities highlighting a vital need to improve understanding on the interplay of transmission dynamics, the role of infected humans and animals in contaminating the water sources and the role of water as a vehicle of disease transmission in these communities. Indeed, this study illustrates the One Health approach which is to recognize that the optimal health of humans are interconnected with the well-being of animals and their environment. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Giardia duodenalis; Human-animal-environment interfaces; Malaysia; One health approach,glutamate dehydrogenase; river water; triosephosphate isomerase; disease prevalence; disease treatment; epidemiology; genotype; health care; infectious disease; parasitic disease; public health; rural population; adolescent; adult; aged; Article; child; controlled study; cross-sectional study; feces analysis; female; Giardia intestinalis; giardiasis; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; nonhuman; parasite prevalence; rural population; water contamination; water sampling; animal; feces; genetics; genotype; Giardia; giardiasis; host parasite interaction; One Health; parasitology; prevalence; river; rural population; statistics and numerical data; transmission; zoonosis; Malaysia; West Malaysia; Animalia; Giardia; Giardia intestinalis; Animals; Cross-Sectional Studies; Feces; Genotype; Giardia; Giardiasis; Host-Parasite Interactions; Humans; Malaysia; One Health; Prevalence; Rivers; Rural Population; Zoonoses,2-s2.0-85028917982

Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) and copy number of variations (CNVs) have been associated with AMD in various populations, however the results are conflicting. Our aim is to determine the CNVs of Complement Factor H-Related genes among Malaysian subjects with wet AMD. 130 patients with wet AMD and 120 healthy controls were included in this research. DNA was extracted from all subjects and CNVs of CFH, CFHR1 and CFHR3 genes; determined using quantitative real-time PCR and were compared between the two groups. A consistent association was observed between CFH gene and wet AMD susceptibility (P < 0.05). The age-adjusted data suggests a possible increased risk of AMD disease (P < 0.05). No correlation was detected between CNVs and wet AMD for the remaining genes after we compared the frequencies of mean for that gene. An association was observed between CFH CNVs and wet AMD in the Malaysian population, however, strong evidence of a link with wet AMD was not found. Further investigative studies are needed using larger sample sizes to elucidate the role of CNVs in AMD pathogenesis. ? 2017",Age-related macular degeneration; CFH gene; Copy number variation; Malaysia,complement factor H; complement factor H; age; age related macular degeneration; aged; Article; complement factor H related 1 gene; complement factor H related 3 gene; controlled study; copy number variation; ethnicity; female; gene; gene frequency; genetic association; genetic susceptibility; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; major clinical study; Malaysian; male; real time polymerase chain reaction; single nucleotide polymorphism; smoking; wet macular degeneration; case control study; copy number variation; demography; eye fundus; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; macular degeneration; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Complement Factor H; Demography; DNA Copy Number Variations; Female; Fundus Oculi; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Male,2-s2.0-85028835269

CT develops due to vertical transmission of the parasite from an infected mother to the child. It is in this manner when the unborn child becomes susceptible to infection. The literature review revealed that 26.0% of infants born from T. gondii infected mother are subclinically infected at birth and 10.0% are either mildly or severely clinically affected, while 3.0% of neonates die. Predominant manifestation of CT is encephalomyelitis, initiated by formation of microglial nodules in the brain. However, the most remarkable classical triad signs of toxoplasmosis are hydrocephalus or microcephalus, intracranial calcification, and retinochoroiditis. Hence, this review focused on the risks of the child from developing CT, the role of the pregnant women on the transmission of the parasite, and the risks of acquiring the parasite by the expectant mothers from Southeast Asia vis-?-vis transmitting the same to the unborn child. Likewise, this review also included the methods used for the diagnosis of CT and its importance in early detection and management of the disease by assessing practical means of controlling the incidence and preventing further transmission of the parasite. ? 2017 by Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart, New York.",congenital toxoplasmosis; pregnancy; Southeast Asia; Toxoplasma gondii,brain calcification; chorioretinitis; clinical feature; congenital toxoplasmosis; echography; encephalomyelitis; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; fine needle aspiration biopsy; human; hydrocephalus; immunocytochemistry; incidence; infection prevention; infection sensitivity; microcephaly; microglia; nonhuman; parasite prevalence; parasite transmission; pregnancy; priority journal; Review; serodiagnosis; Southeast Asia; Toxoplasma gondii,2-s2.0-85026523744

The extraction of DNA plays a vital role in the diagnosis of this life-threatening parasite Plasmodium. Difficulties with existing extraction methods of DNA are increasing with time including detection limits, time duration, sensitivity, availability of chemicals, and cost. Consequently, there is now renewed interest in finding of novel methods for DNA extraction of Plasmodium. However, the extraction of DNA by using microwave irradiation is found to be most convenient and suitable due to its low-cost and usage of common chemical reagents especially for the children in poor resource settings. In addition, the low cost, noninvasive malaria diagnostics tests are needed to carry out particularly for children to avoid accidental infections which may happen due to drawing blood. ? 2017 by Georg Thieme Verlag KG, Stuttgart, New York.",DNA extraction; malaria; noninvasive; plasmodium,chloroform; DNA; microsphere; phenol; resin; Africa; Asia; automated blood counter; chemical analysis; childhood disease; DNA extraction; flow cytometry; human; laboratory technique; limit of detection; loop mediated isothermal amplification; malaria; mass spectrometry; microarray analysis; microscopy; microwave irradiation; non invasive measurement; nonhuman; pigment containing monocyte detection; point of care testing; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; quantitative buffy coat; rapid diagnostic test; Review; saliva analysis; sensitivity analysis; sensitivity and specificity; serology; solid phase extraction; urinalysis,2-s2.0-85020719192

The study included 41 eligible patients above 54?years old, who received both induction and consolidation chemotherapy for AML from 2008 to 2013. The study cohort had a minimum 24?months follow-up period. Survival analysis was carried out to assess patients’ overall survival and disease free survival based on types of consolidation regimens. The consolidation treatment with FLAG exerted a protective effect to both overall survival and disease free survival in older patients. Patients who were consolidated with FLAG regimen had a significant longer overall survival (log-rank, p?=?0.0025) and disease free survival (log-rank, p?=?0.0026). The median overall survival was longer (18.70?months) with the use of FLAG when compared to non-FLAG group (8.09?months). The median disease free survival was also longer (13.84?months) with use of FLAG when compared to the non-FLAG group (4.44?months). Regression analysis with Cox model yielded hazard ratio of 0.245 (p?=?0.0094) in overall survival and 0.217 (p?=?0.0068) in disease free survival.

Chronic periodontitis (CP) is an inflammatory condition that is associated with obesity and adversely affects OHRQoL. Obese patients with CP incur a double burden of disease. In this article we aimed to explore the effect of Non-Surgical Periodontal Therapy (NSPT) on OHRQoL among obese participants with chronic periodontitis. Materials and Methods: This was a randomised control clinical trial at the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya. A total of 66 obese patients with chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated into the treatment group (n=33) who received NSPT, while the control group (n=33) received no treatment. Four participants (2 from each group) were non-contactable 12 weeks post intervention. Therefore, their data were removed from the final analysis. The protocol involved questionnaires (characteristics and OHRQoL (Oral Health Impact Profile-14; OHIP-14)) and a clinical examination. Results: The OHIP prevalence of impact (PI), overall mean OHIP severity score (SS) and mean OHIP Extent of Impact (EI) at baseline and at the 12-week follow up were almost similar between the two groups and statistically not significant at (p=0.618), (p=0.573), and (p=0.915), respectively. However, in a within-group comparison, OHIP PI, OHIP SS, and OHIP EI showed a significant improvement for both treatment and control groups and the p values were ((0.002), (0.008) for PI), ((0.006) and (0.004) for SS) and ((0.006) and (0.002) for EI) in-treatment and control groups, respectively. Conclusion: NSPT did not significantly affect the OHRQoL among those obese with CP. Regardless, NSPT, functional limitation and psychological discomfort domains had significantly improved.

C. inophyllum fruit extract was found to have markedly cytotoxic effect against MCF-7 cells in a dose-dependent manner with the IC50 for 24?h of 23.59??g/mL. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that C. inophyllum fruit extract mediated cell cycle at G0/G1 and G2/M phases, and MCF-7 cells entered the early phase of apoptosis. The expression of anti-apoptotic proteins Bcl-2 was decreased whereas the expression of the pro-apoptotic protein Bax, cytochrome C and p53 were increased after treatment. C. inophyllum fruit extract led to apoptosis in MCF-7 cells via the mitochondrial pathway in a dose dependent manner. This is evidenced by the elevation of intracellular ROS, the loss of mitochondria membrane potential (Δψm), and activation of caspase-3. Meanwhile, dose-dependent genomic DNA fragmentation was observed after C. inophyllum fruits extract treatment by comet assay. This study shows that C. inophyllum fruits extract-induced apoptosis is primarily p53 dependent and mediated through the activation of caspase-3. C. inophyllum fruit extract could be an excellent source of chemopreventive agent in the treatment of breast cancer and has potential to be explored as green anticancer agent. ? 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"antineoplastic agent; Calophyllum inophyllum fruit extract; caspase 3; cytochrome c; gallic acid; genomic DNA; plant extract; polyphenol; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; protein p53; unclassified drug; antineoplastic agent; BCL2 protein, human; CASP3 protein, human; caspase 3; plant extract; polyphenol; protein Bax; protein bcl 2; reactive oxygen metabolite; antineoplastic activity; apoptosis; Article; breast cancer; Calophyllum; Calophyllum inophyllum; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; cell cycle G2 phase; cell cycle M phase; cell population; controlled study; DNA fragmentation; drug mechanism; enzyme activity; flow cytometry; gene expression; human; human cell; IC50; MCF-7 cell line; mitochondrial membrane potential; molecular weight; nonhuman; breast tumor; Calophyllum; chemistry; comet assay; drug effect; female; fruit; genetics; MCF-7 cell line; metabolism; mitochondrion; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; bcl-2-Associated X Protein; Breast Neoplasms; Calophyllum; Caspase 3; Comet Assay; DNA Fragmentation; Female; Fruit; Humans; Inhibitory Concentration 50; MCF-7 Cells; Membrane Potential, Mitochondrial; Mitochondria; Plant Extracts; Polyphenols; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; Reactive Oxygen Species",2-s2.0-85032227178

The use of an appropriate sedative agent is important to ensure the successful completion of the neurodiagnostic procedures, particularly in children, who are usually unable to remain still throughout the procedure. Objectives: To assess the effectiveness and adverse effects of chloral hydrate as a sedative agent for non-invasive neurodiagnostic procedures in children. Search methods: We used the standard search strategy of the Cochrane Epilepsy Group. We searched MEDLINE (OVID SP) (1950 to July 2017), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library, Issue 7, 2017), Embase (1980 to July 2017), and the Cochrane Epilepsy Group Specialized Register (via CENTRAL) using a combination of keywords and MeSH headings. Selection criteria: We included randomised controlled trials that assessed chloral hydrate agent against other sedative agent(s), non-drug agent(s), or placebo for children undergoing non-invasive neurodiagnostic procedures. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed the studies for their eligibility, extracted data, and assessed risk of bias. Results were expressed in terms of risk ratio (RR) for dichotomous data, mean difference (MD) for continuous data, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Main results: We included 13 studies with a total of 2390 children. The studies were all conducted in hospitals that provided neurodiagnostic services. Most studies assessed the proportion of sedation failure during the neurodiagnostic procedure, time for adequate sedation, and potential adverse effects associated with the sedative agent. The methodological quality of the included studies was mixed, as reflected by a wide variation in their 'Risk of bias' profiles. Blinding of the participants and personnel was not achieved in most of the included studies, and three of the 13 studies had high risk of bias for selective reporting. Evaluation of the efficacy of the sedative agents was also underpowered, with all the comparisons performed in single small studies. Children who received oral chloral hydrate had lower sedation failure when compared with oral promethazine (RR 0.11, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.82; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). Children who received oral chloral hydrate had a higher risk of sedation failure after one dose compared to those who received intravenous pentobarbital (RR 4.33, 95% CI 1.35 to 13.89; 1 study, low-quality evidence), but after two doses there was no evidence of a significant difference between the two groups (RR 3.00, 95% CI 0.33 to 27.46; 1 study, very low-quality evidence). Children who received oral chloral hydrate appeared to have more sedation failure when compared with music therapy, but the quality of evidence was very low for this outcome (RR 17.00, 95% CI 2.37 to 122.14; 1 study). Sedation failure rates were similar between oral chloral hydrate, oral dexmedetomidine, oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride, and oral midazolam. Children who received oral chloral hydrate had a shorter time to achieve adequate sedation when compared with those who received oral dexmedetomidine (MD -3.86, 95% CI -5.12 to -2.6; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence), oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride (MD -7.5, 95% CI -7.85 to -7.15; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence), oral promethazine (MD -12.11, 95% CI -18.48 to -5.74; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence), and rectal midazolam (MD -95.70, 95% CI -114.51 to -76.89; 1 study). However, children with oral chloral hydrate took longer to achieve adequate sedation when compared with intravenous pentobarbital (MD 19, 95% CI 16.61 to 21.39; 1 study, low-quality evidence) and intranasal midazolam (MD 12.83, 95% CI 7.22 to 18.44; 1 study, moderate-quality evidence). No data were available to assess the proportion of children with successful completion of neurodiagnostic procedure without interruption by the child awakening. Most trials did not assess adequate sedation as measured by specific validated scales, except in the comparison of chloral hydrate versus intranasal midazolam and oral promethazine. Compared to dexmedetomidine, chloral hydrate was associated with a higher risk of nausea and vomiting (RR 12.04 95% CI 1.58 to 91.96). No other adverse events were significantly associated with chloral hydrate (including behavioural change, oxygen desaturation) although there was an increased risk of adverse events overall (RR 7.66, 95% CI 1.78 to 32.91; 1 study, low-quality evidence). Authors' conclusions: The quality of evidence for the comparisons of oral chloral hydrate against several other methods of sedation was very variable. Oral chloral hydrate appears to have a lower sedation failure rate when compared with oral promethazine for children undergoing paediatric neurodiagnostic procedures. The sedation failure was similar for other comparisons such as oral dexmedetomidine, oral hydroxyzine hydrochloride, and oral midazolam. When compared with intravenous pentobarbital and music therapy, oral chloral hydrate had a higher sedation failure rate. However, it must be noted that the evidence for the outcomes for the comparisons of oral chloral hydrate against intravenous pentobarbital and music therapy was of very low to low quality, therefore the corresponding findings should be interpreted with caution. Further research should determine the effects of oral chloral hydrate on major clinical outcomes such as successful completion of procedures, requirements for additional sedative agent, and degree of sedation measured using validated scales, which were rarely assessed in the studies included in this review. The safety profile of chloral hydrate should be studied further, especially the risk of major adverse effects such as bradycardia, hypotension, and oxygen desaturation. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This study aimed to develop and validate an instrument that assess determinants that influence individuals’ intention to undergo CVD health checks. Methods: The concepts and items were developed based on findings from our prior exploratory qualitative study on factors influencing individuals’ intention to undergo CVD health checks. Content validity of the questionnaire was assessed by a panel of six experts and the item-level content validity index (I-CVI) was determined. After pretesting the questionnaire was pilot tested to check reliability of the items. Exploratory factor analysis was used to test for dimensionality using a sample of 240 participants. Results: The finalized questionnaire consists of 36 items, covering nine concepts. The I-CVI for all items was satisfactory with values ranging from 0.83 to 1.00. The exploratory factor analysis showed that the number of factors extracted was consistent with the theoretical concepts. Correlations values between items ranged from 0.30 to 0.85 and all the factor loadings were more than 0.40, indicating satisfactory structural validity. All concepts showed good internal consistency, Cronbach’s alpha values ranged 0.66–0.85. Conclusions: The determinants for CVD health check questionnaire has good content and structural validity, and its reliability was established. It can be used to assess determinants influencing individuals’ intention to undergo CVD health checks. ? 2017 Cheong et al.

Methods: Forty-one patients and 30 healthy volunteers were recruited and categorized into HCC, liver metastasis, and control groups based on their computed tomography and sonographic examinations. Elasticity values of different groups were compared statistically. Results: Mean (standard deviation) elasticity values for HCC, liver metastasis, and normal liver tissue were 51.45 (14.96), 49.89 (13.82), and 6.63 (1.65) kilopascal, respectively. Statistically significant differences were found between the elasticity values of HCC and liver metastasis with normal liver tissue. Based on the receiver operating characteristics analysis, 18.25 kilopascal may differentiate the malignant focal liver lesions from the normal liver tissue with both sensitivity and specificity of 100%. Conclusion: Shear wave ultrasound elastography may be able to differentiate HCC and liver metastasis from normal liver tissue based on the tissue elasticity values. ? 2017, ?

Methods Patients (n = 20), Nurses (n = 10), pharmacists (n = 11), doctors (n = 10) and policy makers (n = 5) from a primary care were individually interviewed using a semi-structured topic guide. Purposive sampling was used. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis informed by constant comparison. Results Patients, doctors, nurses, pharmacists and policy makers were eager for pharmacists to be more proactive in creating health awareness and conducting osteoporosis screening at the primary care clinic via inter-professional collaboration. These findings were further examined using the D'Amour's structural model of collaboration which encompasses four main themes: shared goals and visions, internalization, formalization and governance. This model supports our data which highlights a lack of understanding of the pharmacists' role among the doctors, nurses, policy makers and pharmacists themselves. There is also a lack of governance and formalization, that fosters consensus, leadership, protocol and information exchange. Nonetheless, the stakeholders trust that pharmacists have sufficient knowledge to contribute to the screening of osteoporosis. Our primary care clinic can be described as developing towards an inter-professional collaboration in managing osteoporosis but is still in its early stages.

To promote comprehensive patient management, the role of medical professionals in oral health maintenance is compelling, thus indicating the need for educational preparation in this area of practice. This study aimed to determine the extent of training in oral health in Malaysian and Australian medical schools. An audio-recorded semi-structured phone interview involving Academic Programme Directors in Malaysian (n = 9, response rate=81.8%) and Australian (n = 7, response rate = 35.0%) medical schools was conducted during the 2014/2015 and 2014 academic years, respectively. Qualitative data was analysed via thematic analysis, involving coding and grouping into emerging themes. Quantitative data were measured for frequencies. It was found that medical schools in Malaysia and Australia offered limited teaching of various oral health-related components that were mostly integrated throughout the curriculum, in the absence of structured learning objectives, teaching methodologies and assessment approaches. Barriers to providing oral health education included having insufficient expertise and overloaded curriculum. As medical educators demonstrated support for oral health education, collaboration amongst various stakeholders is integral to developing a well-structured curriculum and practice guidelines on oral health management involving medical professionals. ? 2016 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

With growing morbidity and health care cost there is a significant need for understanding the disease from the Asian perspective. This book would fill the gap in the knowledge on GERD among Asians and will highlight the difference in terms of epidemiology, diagnosis and management of GERD from the Western perspective. The novel imaging, diagnostic modalities and treatment aspects will be essentially highlighted in this book. It also deals about the pathogenesis and risk factors of Asians for the development of GERD which have not been explored before.

Various factors underlie this rise, which can be broadly divided into environmental and host genetic factors. Among these factors, the rapid increase in overweight and obesity in the region is probably the most important. Other factors include lifestyle changes which have accompanied ""Westernization"" of the Asian population, including a change in diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity, but these are often hard to measure. A decline in Helicobacter pylori infection across the region likely plays an important role as well. Ethnic differences and differences in the rate of rise of GERD between ethnic groups in the region point to a key role for host genetic factors. Genetic polymorphisms which involve the interleukin- 1B gene have been reported, but more work needs to be done in this area. ? Springer India 2018.

Current therapeutics to treat LF are mainly microfilarcidal, and lack activity against adult worms. This set back, poses a challenge for the control and elimination of filariasis. Thus, in this study the activities of caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) against the filarial worm B. pahangi and its bacterial endosymbiont, Wolbachia were evaluated. Different concentrations (2, 5, 10, 15, 20?μg/ml) of CAPE were used to assess its effects on motility, viability and microfilarial (mf) production of B. pahangi in vitro. Anti-Wolbachial activity of CAPE was measured in worms by quantification of Wolbachial wsp gene copy number using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Our findings show that CAPE was found to significantly reduce adult worm motility, viability, and mf release both in vitro and in vivo. 20?μg/ml of CAPE halts the release of mf in vitro by day 6 of post treatment. Also, the number of adult worms recovered in vivo were reduced significantly during and after treatment with 50?mg/kg of CAPE relative to control drugs, diethylcarbamazine and doxycycline. Real time PCR based on the Wolbachia ftsZ gene revealed a significant reduction in Wolbachia copy number upon treatment.

The wounds can be developed superficially or from within deep tissues, depending on the nature of the dominant risk factors. Developing a reproducible quantitative method to assess wound-healing status has demonstrated to be a convoluted task. Advances in High-Frequency Ultrasound (HFU) skin scanners have expanded their application as they are cost-effective and reproducible diagnostic tools in dermatology, including for the measurement of skin thickness, the assessment of skin tumours, the estimation of the volume of melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers, the visualisation of skin structure and the monitoring of the healing of acute and chronic wounds. Previous studies have revealed that HFU images carry dominant parameters and depict the phenomena occurring within deep tissue layers during the wound-healing process. However, the investigations have mostly focussed on the validation of HFU images, and few studies have utilised HFU imaging in quantitative assessment of wound generation and healing. This paper is an introductory review of the important studies proposed by the researchers in the context of wound assessment. The principles of dermasonography are briefly explained, followed by a review of the relevant literature that investigated the wound-healing process and tissue structures within the wound using HFU imaging. ? 2017 Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.",Dermatologic sonography; High-frequency ultrasound; Wound assessment; Wound healing,,2-s2.0-85049212721

Decades of scientific study have linked the overexpression of ERBB2 antigen to aggressive tumors. To target aggressive breast cancer, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) technology can be utilized. For this, human T-cells are transduced with a gene sequence encoding a CAR that is specific for tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). These genetically-engineered CAR transduced T-cells (CAR-T cells) are able to target the tumor antigen without the need for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) recognition, rendering it a potentially universal immunotherapeutic option. However, efficient transduction of therapeutic gene into human T-cells and further cell expansion are challenging. In this study, we reported a successful optimization of a transduction protocol using spinoculation on CD3+ T-cells with different concentrations of lentiviral plasmid encoding the CAR gene. CD3+T-cells were isolated from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The constructed CAR gene was inserted into a lentiviral plasmid containing the green fluorescent protein (GFP) tag and lentiviral particles were produced. These lentiviral particles were used to transduce activated T-cells by spinoculation. T-cells were activated using Dynabead-conjugated CD3/CD28 human T-cell activator and interleukin-2 (IL-2) before transduction. CD3+ T-cells were selected and GFP expression, which indicated transduction, was observed.

This paper assesses baseline characteristics, treatment, and clinical outcomes at two years’ follow-up of Malaysian/Bruneian patients compared with the overall registry population. Method: Between November 2009 and July 2010, outpatients from 45 countries who met the criteria for stable CAD were recruited into the registry. Baseline characteristics were documented at enrolment, and patients were reassessed during their annual visits over a five-year follow-up period. Key outcomes measured were sudden death and cardiovascular (CV) death, non-CV death and CV morbidity. Results: At baseline, 33,283 patients were available for analysis within the registry; 380 and 27 were Malaysians and Bruneians, respectively. The mean ages of Malaysian/Bruneian patients and the rest of the world (RoW) were 57.83 ±9.98 years and 64.23 ± 10.46 years, respectively (p&lt;0.001). The median body mass index values were 26.6 (24.4-29.6) kg/m2 and 27.3 (24.8-30.3) kg/m2, respectively (p=0.014). Malaysian/Bruneian patients had lower rates of myocardial infarction (54.55% versus 59.76%, p=0.033) and higher rates of diabetes (43.24% versus 28.99%, p&lt;0.001) and dyslipidaemia (90.42% versus 74.66%, p&lt;0.001) compared with the RoW. Measured clinical outcomes in Malaysian and Bruneian patients at 2-years follow-up were low and generally comparable to the RoW. Conclusion: Malaysian/Bruneian patients with stable CAD tend to be younger with poorer diabetic control compared with the RoW.

The current method in measuring EPM is using laser which the target particles are not visible. Additional morphology information is critical for the EPM measurement. Image processing is a promising method to obtain the EPM together with the morphology information. In this study, a setup of micro electrophoresis system with a compact CCD microscope was constructed. This setup was equipped with image processing method for capturing the images of the moving particles in an electric field. With the image processing method (Horn-Schunck method), the images captured were processed in real time to obtain the EPM of the particle. Velocity of the particles was then measured and the particles' EPM was obtained. With the captured images of the particles in real time, the system can present the image of the targeted particle together with the EPM value. The setup of this prototype was calibrated with discrete particles (Polystyrene microsphere size of 10μm± 5%) and with a magnification value of 125X. This system is suitable for the surface charge measurement of discrete particle with size in between 4μm and 20μm. Comparison of commercialized device with our laboratory setup for calibration on EPM of polystyrene beads had a variance of solely 13%. Measurement on yeast cells, normal (hFob 1.19) and cancer bone cells (U2OS) indicated that the EPM of yeast became highly negative in the pH value of 4.5 and 6.5. The negative EPM of the cancer cell is slightly larger than that of the normal cell for pH ranging from 4.4 to 5.0.

We evaluated beat-to-beat supine and standing BP variability (BPV) using time and frequency domain analysis from noninvasive continuous BP recordings. A total of 1218 older adults were selected. Continuous BP recordings obtained were analyzed to determine standard deviation (SD) and root mean square of real variability (RMSRV) for time domain BPV and fast-Fourier transform low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), total power spectral density (PSD), and LF:HF ratio for frequency domain BPV. Comparisons were performed between 256 (21%) individuals with at least 1 fall in the past 12 months and nonfallers. Fallers were significantly older (P=.007), more likely to be female (P=.006), and required a longer time to complete the Timed-Up and Go test (TUG) and frailty walk test (P?.001). Standing systolic BPV (SBPV) was significantly lower in fallers compared to nonfallers (SBPVSD, P=.016; SBPV-RMSRV, P=.033; SBPV-LF, P=.003; SBPV-total PSD, P=.012). Nonfallers had significantly higher supine to standing ratio (SSR) for SBPV-SD, SBPV-RMSRV, and SBPV-total PSD (P=.017, P=.013, and P=.009). In multivariate analyses, standing BPV remained significantly lower in fallers compared to nonfallers after adjustment for age, sex, diabetes, frailty walk, and supine systolic BP. The reduction in frequency-domain SSR among fallers was attenuated by supine systolic BP, TUG, and frailty walk. In conclusion, reduced beat-to-beat BPV while standing is independently associated with increased risk of falls. Changes between supine and standing BPV are confounded by supine BP and walking speed. ? 2017 the Author(s).

One of the complications of dengue is dehydration which, if not carefully monitored and treated, may lead to shock, particularly in those with dengue haemorrhagic fever. WHO has recommended oral fluid intake of five glasses or more for adults who are suspected to have dengue fever. However, there have been no published studies looking at self-care intervention measures to improve oral fluid intake among patients suspected of dengue fever. Objective: To assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using a fluid chart to improve oral fluid intake in patients with suspected dengue fever in a primary care setting. Methods: This feasibility study used a randomized controlled study design. The data was collected over two months at a primary care clinic in a teaching hospital. The inclusion criteria were: age &gt; 12 years, patients who were suspected to have dengue fever based on the assessment by the primary healthcare clinician, fever for &gt; three days, and thrombocytopenia (platelets &lt; 150 x 109/L). Both groups received a dengue home care card. The intervention group received the fluid chart and a cup (200ml). Baseline clinical and laboratory data, 24-hour fluid recall (control group), and fluid chart were collected. The main outcomes were: hospitalization rates, intravenous fluid requirement and total oral fluid intake. Findings: Among the 138 participants who were included in the final analysis, there were fewer hospital admissions in the intervention group (n = 7, 10.0%) than the control group (n = 12, 17.6%) (p = 0.192). Similarly, fewer patients (n = 9, 12.9%) in the intervention group required intravenous fluid compared to the control group (n = 15, 22.1%), (p = 0.154). There was an increase in the amount of daily oral fluid intake in the intervention group (about 3,000 ml) compared to the control group (about 2,500 ml, p = 0.521). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: This is a feasible and acceptable study to perform in a primary care setting. The fluid chart is a simple, inexpensive tool that may reduce hospitalization and intravenous fluid requirement in suspected dengue patients. A randomized controlled trial with larger sample size is needed to determine this conclusively.

Methods In this cross-sectional study, a total of 605 stool samples were collected and screened for the presence of Giardia duodenalis (G. duodenalis) cysts and/or trophozoites by using three different diagnostic methods: direct smear, formalin-ether sedimentation, and trichrome staining. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect information on the demographic, socioeconomic, behavioural and environmental characteristics of the participants. Results Overall, 28.1% (170/605) of the participants were infected by G. duodenalis. The prevalence was significantly higher among male participants compared to female (P = 0.034); however, it was not significant among different age groups (P > 0.05). Univariate and multivariate analyses identified four variables as the significant key risk factors of Giardia infection among the sampled communities. These are, in addition to being of the male gender, using unsafe water sources for drinking water, not washing hands after defecation, presence of other family members infected with Giardia, and close contact with domestic animals. Conclusions The study reveals that Giardia infection is still prevalent among rural communities in Yemen. The provision of clean and safe drinking water, proper sanitation, and health education regarding personal hygiene practices, particularly handwashing, as well as identifying and treating infected family members is imperative and these interventions should be considered in a strategy to control intestinal parasites among these communities in order to curtail the transmission and morbidity caused by G. duodenalis. ? 2017 Hainan Medical University",Giardia duodenalis; Prevalence; Risk factors; Yemen,adolescent; adult; age; aged; Article; child; community; cross-sectional study; defecation; disease transmission; domestic animal; family history; feces analysis; female; giardiasis; hand washing; human; infection risk; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; rural population; sex difference; water contamination; Yemen,2-s2.0-85030572022

The purpose of this study was to examine if students' performance in the earlier professional examinations (Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3A) could predict their performance in the final professional examination or Exit Examination (Phase 3B). Methods: The study population comprised three cohorts of medical undergraduates in UM. For each cohort, retrospective analyses of students' performance in the four professional examinations were conducted using stepwise multiple regression analysis. In the regression analysis, students' Phase 3B score was the dependent/criterion variable while Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3A scores were the independent/predictor variables. All the variables were continuous variables. Results: For Cohort 2006/2011, stepwise multiple regression gave a regression model with a good fit: R2 = 0.681, R2 adjusted = 0.679, [F (1, 172) = 367.355, p < 0.001]. Phase 3A score, which explained 68.1% of the variance, was the only significant predictor of students performance in the Exit Examination. The regression models for Cohort 2007 / 2012 and Cohort 2008 / 2013 were also good fit: with R2 = 0.614, R2 adjusted = 0.611, [F (1, 163) = 258.875, p < 0.001] and R2 = 0.572, R2 adjusted = 0.570, [F (1, 172) = 230.029, p < 0.001] respectively. Conclusion: The percent variance explained by the only predictor variable (Phase 3A score) suggested the possibility of the impact of non-cognitive variables on the criterion variable (Phase 3B score). For all the three cohorts, only Phase 3A score was a significant predictor of students' performance in the Exit Examination. ? 2017 Japan Health Sciences University.",Exit examination; Medical students; Performance; Predictor variables; Regression analysis,case report; cohort analysis; controlled study; criterion variable; DNA polymorphism; human; Malaysia; medical student; multiple regression; phase 3 clinical trial; predictor variable; remission; retrospective study,2-s2.0-85029662855

Three Vp measuring techniques, namely non-adaptive (NA), adaptive positions (AP) and adaptive vectors (AV) method, were suggested and compared. We performed the comparison on nine healthy volunteers and nine post-infarct patients at four measurement positions, respectively, at one-third, one-half, two-thirds and the conventional 4?cm distances from the mitral valve leaflet into the left ventricle. We found that the Vp measurement was affected by both the inflow jet direction and measurement positions. Both NA and AP methods overestimated Vp, especially in dilated left ventricles, while the AV method showed the strongest correlation with the isovolumic relaxation myocardial strain rate (r?=?0.53, p?&lt;?0.05). Using the AV method, notable difference in mean Vp was also observed between healthy volunteers and post-infarct patients at positions of: one-half (81?±?31 vs. 58?±?25?cm/s), two-thirds (89?±?32 vs. 45?±?15?cm/s) and 4?cm (98?±?23 vs. 47?±?13?cm/s) distances.

The objective of the present study was to ascertain the nutritional status of children admitted to a pediatric tertiary center in Malaysia and the risk factors leading to undernutrition upon admission. Methods In this cross-sectional, hospital-based study, anthropometric measurements [weight, length/height, mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), triceps skinfold thickness were performed in 285 children aged from 3 months to 15 years who were admitted to University Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur in November 2013. Acute (wasting) and chronic (stunting) undernutrition were defined as weight-for-height (WFH) and height-for-age (HFA) < ?2 standard deviation (S.D.), respectively. Underweight was defined as weight-for-age < ?2 S.D. For children aged between 1 and 5 years of age, World Health Organization definition for acute undernutrition (HFA < ?2 S.D. and/or MUAC < 12.5 cm) was also noted. Results Upon admission, the prevalence rates of acute and chronic undernutrition were 11% (n = 32) and 14% (n = 41), respectively. In addition, 7% (n = 21) had an MUAC of < 12.5 cm, 15% had body-mass index < ?2 S.D., and 7% (n = 21) had triceps skinfold thickness < ?2 S.D., while 17% (n = 47) were underweight. Using the World Health Organization definition of acute undernutrition, an additional eight patients were noted to have acute undernutrition (n = 40, 14%). No significant risk factors associated with undernutrition were identified. Conclusion The prevalence of undernutrition among children admitted to a tertiary hospital in Malaysia was 14%.

Randomized controlled trial. Objective. The present study investigated the effectiveness of chewing gum on promoting faster bowel function and its ability to hasten recovery for patients with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) after posterior spinal fusion (PSF) surgery. Summary of Background Data. Sham feeding with chewing gum had been reported to reduce the incidence of postoperative ileus by accelerating recovery of bowel function. Methods. We prospectively recruited and randomized 60 patients with AIS scheduled for PSF surgery into treatment (chewing gum) and control group. The patient-controlled anesthesia usage, wound pain score, abdominal pain score, nausea score, and abdominal girth were assessed and recorded at 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 hours postoperatively. The timing for the first fluid intake, first oral intake, sitting up, walking, first flatus after surgery, first bowel opening after surgery, and duration of hospital stay were also assessed and recorded. Results. We found that there were no significant differences (P > 0.05) in patient-controlled anesthesia usage, wound pain score, abdominal pain score, nausea score, and abdominal girth between treatment (chewing gum) and control groups. We also found that there were no significant difference (P > 0.05) in postoperative recovery parameters, which were the first fluid intake, first oral intake, sitting up after surgery, walking after surgery, first flatus after surgery, first bowel opening after surgery, and duration of hospital stay between both groups. The wound pain was the worst at 12 hours postoperatively, which progressively improved in both groups. The abdominal pain progressively worsened to the highest score at 48 hours in the treatment group and 36 hours in the control group before improving after that. The pattern of severity and recovery of wound pain and abdominal pain was different. Conclusion. We found that chewing gum did not significantly reduce the abdominal pain, promote faster bowel function, or hasten patient recovery. Copyright ? 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

In those affected by the more severe forms, regular blood transfusions are required which may lead to iron overload. Accumulated iron from blood transfusions may be deposited in vital organs including the heart, liver and endocrine organs such as the pituitary glands which can affect growth hormone production. Growth hormone deficiency is one of the factors that can lead to short stature, a common complication in people with thalassaemia. Growth hormone replacement therapy has been used in children with thalassaemia who have short stature and growth hormone deficiency. Objectives: To assess the benefits and safety of growth hormone therapy in people with thalassaemia. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Haemoglobinopathies Trials Register, compiled from electronic database searches and handsearching of journals and conference abstract books. We also searched the reference lists of relevant articles, reviews and clinical trial registries. Our database and trial registry searches are current to 10 August 2017 and 08 August 2017, respectively. Selection criteria: Randomised and quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing the use of growth hormone therapy to placebo or standard care in people with thalassaemia of any type or severity. Data collection and analysis: Two authors independently selected trials for inclusion. Data extraction and assessment of risk of bias were also conducted independently by two authors. The quality of the evidence was assessed using GRADE criteria. Main results: One parallel trial conducted in Turkey was included. The trial recruited 20 children with homozygous beta thalassaemia who had short stature; 10 children received growth hormone therapy administered subcutaneously on a daily basis at a dose of 0.7 IU/kg per week and 10 children received standard care. The overall risk of bias in this trial was low except for the selection criteria and attrition bias which were unclear. The quality of the evidence for all major outcomes was moderate, the main concern was imprecision of the estimates due to the small sample size leading to wide confidence intervals. Final height (cm) (the review's pre-specified primary outcome) and change in height were not assessed in the included trial. The trial reported no clear difference between groups in height standard deviation (SD) score after one year, mean difference (MD) -0.09 (95% confidence interval (CI) -0.33 to 0.15 (moderate quality evidence). However, modest improvements appeared to be observed in the following key outcomes in children receiving growth hormone therapy compared to control (moderate quality evidence): change between baseline and final visit in height SD score, MD 0.26 (95% CI 0.13 to 0.39); height velocity, MD 2.28 cm/year (95% CI 1.76 to 2.80); height velocity SD score, MD 3.31 (95% CI 2.43 to 4.19); and change in height velocity SD score between baseline and final visit, MD 3.41 (95% CI 2.45 to 4.37). No adverse effects of treatment were reported in either group; however, while there was no clear difference between groups in the oral glucose tolerance test at one year, fasting blood glucose was significantly higher in the growth hormone therapy group compared to control, although both results were still within the normal range, MD 6.67 mg/dL (95% CI 2.66 to 10.68). There were no data beyond the one-year trial period. Authors' conclusions: A small single trial contributed evidence of moderate quality that the use of growth hormone for a year may improve height velocity of children with thalassaemia although height SD score in the treatment group was similar to the control group. There are no randomised controlled trials in adults or trials that address the use of growth hormone therapy over a longer period and assess its effect on final height and quality of life. The optimal dosage of growth hormone and the ideal time to start this therapy remain uncertain. Large well-designed randomised controlled trials over a longer period with sufficient duration of follow up are needed. ? 2017 The Cochrane Collaboration.

We aimed to determine adherence to the Malaysian guidelines by primary care physicians regarding the prescribing of anti-hypertensive medications for hypertensive patients with diabetes mellitus, proteinuria and those aged =65 years. We retrospectively reviewed medical records of patients who attended a primary care clinic from January to May 2012. One out of every four records of hypertensive patients aged >18 years who had been followed-up for at least a year, were randomly sampled. Records of 1,060 patients were reviewed: 507 subjects (47.8%) had diabetes mellitus and 374 (73.8%) were prescribed reninangiotensin- system blockers (RAS-blockers). Eighty-six out of 367 subjects tested (23.4%) had proteinuria, of which 46 (53.5%) were prescribed RAS-blockers. All subjects (100%) with diabetes mellitus and proteinuria (n=65) were prescribed angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors as per guidelines. Of the 431 patients aged =65 years, the anti-hypertensive medications prescribed were calcium channel blockers (67.7%), RAS-blockers (52.4%), diuretics (35.5%), beta blockers (31.8%) and alpha blockers (6%). Adherence of primary care physicians to anti-hypertensive medication guidelines was good, but there is still room for improvement in the use of RAS-blockers to treat hypertensive subjects with proteinuria. ? 2017, SEAMEO TROPMED Network.

The national prevalence of diagnosed Hypertension among Malaysian adults has increased from 32.2% in the Third National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS III) report and became 32.7% in the Fourth National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS IV) report (Ministry of Health, 2011). Hazard is a condition to look into which the likelihood rate of getting diagnosed Hypertension resulting from increased risk that contributes to higher prevalence. An individual will have higher risk to be diagnosed with Hypertension if he has been exposed to more hazards. This study was done based on the cross sectional study carried out by the Ministry of Health based on secondary data from The Third National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS III) and The Fourth National Health and Morbidity Survey (NHMS IV). Hazard ratios were estimated by multivariate analysis using Cox proportional hazard models. It is noticeable that the hazard ratios of drinking and smoking indicate the relative risk of suffering from diagnosed Hypertension will increase drinking and will increase by for smoking 20% and 30% respectively as compared to non-drinking and non-smoking respectively. Therefore, the effectiveness of Government intervention can be monitored through the estimated hazard ratio of risk factors. Hence, the hazard ratio could serve as an indicator for monitoring the effectiveness of Government intervention on diagnosed Hypertension.

The molecular aspects of pathogenesis of tuberculous meningitis remain poorly understood. We evaluated the correlation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum cytokine levels with the clinical outcome of 15 HIV-negative patients with tuberculous meningitis. We also assessed the association of CSF and serum cytokines with neuroimaging of brain findings in the patients. Methods: The prospective longitudinal study was conducted at the University Malaya Medical Centre between 2012 and 2014. Neuroimaging of the brain was performed and the findings of leptomeningeal enhancement, hydrocephalus, tuberculoma, infarcts and vasculopathy were recorded. The CSF and serum specimens were analyzed for IL-1?, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18, IP-10, IFN-γ, MCP-1, TGF-?, VEGF, TNF- α, IL-18BPa and MMP-9. The clinical outcome was graded at 3 months based on Modified Rankin scale (mRS). Results: On admission and at one month of anti-tuberculosis treatment, the CSF levels of IL-8, IL-1β, IP-10, IFN-γ and VEGF were elevated in all of the patients. Serum IP-10, MCP-1, IL-1β and IL-8 levels were increased on admission and at one month of anti-tuberculosis treatment. There were statistically significant differences between good and poor outcome (mRS at 3 months) for CSF IFN-γ (p=0.033), CSF IL-10 (p=0.033) and serum VEGF (p=0.033) at one month of treatment. None of the patients showed any association between CSF and serum cytokines on admission and at one month of anti-tuberculosis treatment with neuro-radiological findings. Conclusion: The CSF cytokine levels were not related to TBM disease severity on admission, and changes on MRI/CT scans. CSF levels of IFN-γ and IL-10 at one month of anti-tuberculosis treatment were associated with clinical outcome at 3 months. CSF cytokine levels on admission were not associated with the clinical outcome. ? 2017, ASEAN Neurological Association.

We present the case of a 41-year-old female with multiple resections at different sites over the course of 11 years. The approach considerations, as well as treatment options and prognosis are discussed. A 41-year-old female with two previous resections for intracranial meningeal HPC in 2004 and 2008, as well as adjuvant radiotherapy, presented in 2015 with left intrathoracic and left hip recurrence confirmed by positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT). She underwent left proximal femur resection/reconstruction and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) resection of the intrathoracic tumour was attempted. She was discharged home on her 4th post-operative day with minimal pain. There were no neurosensory or motor deficits. Any patient who has been diagnosed with HPC in the past who develops new symptoms should be worked up for recurrence, regardless of the length of disease-free interval, as our case study suggested. There has yet to be a standardized follow-up regime due to the rarity of these tumours. HPC remains a rare soft tissue sarcoma with high recurrence rate. Planned VATS evaluation and resection is possible provided complete resection with clear surgical margins can be achieved, as clear surgical margins offer the best chance of survival. ?

Teaching hospitals and general hospitals in Malaysia are main providers of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a common treatment for CAD. Few studies have analyzed the contemporary data on local cardiac facilities. Service expansion and budget allocation require cost evidence from various providers. We aim to compare the patient characteristics, procedural outcomes, and cost profile between a teaching hospital (TH) and a general hospital (GH). Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted from the healthcare providers’ perspective from January 1st to June 30th 2014. TH is a university teaching hospital in the capital city, while GH is a state-level general hospital. Both are government-funded cardiac referral centers. Clinical data was extracted from a national cardiac registry. Cost data was collected using mixed method of top-down and bottom-up approaches. Total hospitalization cost per PCI patient was summed up from the costs of ward admission and cardiac catheterization laboratory utilization. Clinical characteristics were compared with chi-square and independent t-test, while hospitalization length and cost were analyzed using Mann-Whitney test. Results: The mean hospitalization cost was RM 12,117 (USD 3,366) at GH and RM 16,289 (USD 4,525) at TH. The higher cost at TH can be attributed to worse patients’ comorbidities and cardiac status. In contrast, GH recorded a lower mean length of stay as more patients had same-day discharge, resulting in 29% reduction in mean cost of admission compared to TH. For both hospitals, PCI consumables accounted for the biggest proportion of total cost. Conclusions: The high PCI consumables cost highlighted the importance of cost-effective purchasing mechanism. Findings on the heterogeneity of the patients, treatment practice and hospitalization cost between TH and GH are vital for formulation of cost-saving strategies to ensure sustainable and equitable cardiac service in Malaysia. ? 2017 Lee et al.

To improve its therapeutic efficacy and selective targeting, here we developed a targeted delivery system mediated by the active ligand-folate receptor chemistry to deliver the 5-FU drug selectively into the tumor microenvironment. The preparation was achieved by exploring chitosan (CS)-biopolymer based system with folic acid (FA)-conjugation. The 5-FU@FACS-Mn:ZnS quantum dots (QDs) based on the histological assessment conducted in the 4T1 challenged mice showed an improved tumor remission in the liver, spleen and lungs. The 5-FU@FACS-Mn:ZnS composite induced anti-proliferative properties in these organs as compared to the free 5-FU drug. Unlike the 5-FU@FACS-Mn:ZnS treated groups which showed some specific morphological changes such as cell shrinkage without obvious presence of adipocytes, the excised section of the tumor in the untreated control group and the free 5-FU drug treated group showed necrotic and degenerated cells; these cells are multifocally distributed in the tumor mass with evidence of widely distributed adipocytes within the tumor mass. These findings suggest that the 5-FU@FACS-Mn:ZnS composite has a superior role during the induction of apoptosis in the 4T1 cells as compared to the free 5-FU drug treated groups. The results of the study therefore suggest that the impregnation of 5-FU anti-cancer drug within the FACS-Mn:ZnS system significantly improves its selective targeting efficacy, in addition to improving the anti-proliferative properties and attenuate possible tumor resistances to the 5-FU drug.

In this regard, human health issues are a growing global concern, and the development of effective methods for the detection and differentiation of biomolecules during diagnosis and/or treatment of diseases is essential. However, achieving adequate levels of sensitivity and specificity will be fundamental for the successful clinical application of biosensing technology. Notably, sensitivity and specificity are highly dependent on non-fouling (specificity) of biomolecules on the sensing surfaces, particularly with regard to nanoparticle-tagged biomolecules. Here, the authors have evaluated bio-fouling (i.e., biological non-specificity) by analysing four distinct sensing substrates (gold, silicon, silica and platinum) using anti-mouse immunoglobulin-conjugated gold nanoparticles. As evidenced by scanning electron microscopy and ultraviolet–visible–near-infrared recording spectrophotometry, silica (SiO2) lacked bio-fouling, whereas gold (Au) showed high bio-fouling potential. Indeed, Raman spectroscopic analysis further confirmed these results. Thus, the present findings indicate that SiO2 is an optimal substrate for biosensor development. ? 2015, The National Academy of Sciences, India.",Bio-fouling; Biomaterials; Metals; Sensors; Surfaces; Thin films,,2-s2.0-85026197865

This study aims to ascertain the optimal, tolerance and toxic levels of iron in a protein-free embryo culture medium (PFM) to determine the effect of iron on embryonic development. The application of PFM in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) is intended to eliminate disease transmission and improve ART treatment outcome. The optimal, tolerance and toxic levels of iron on human spermatozoa and mouse embryos were determined by challenging them with different levels of iron (ferric iron; Fe+3). Human normozoospermic semen samples (n = 24) and days 1–4 Quakenbush Special (Qs) mouse embryos (n = 1160) were incubated in PFM supplemented with different concentrations of Fe+3 over different periods of time. 2.0 μg/mL (35.8 μM) of Fe+3 was the optimal level of Fe+3 for human spermatozoa with a tolerance range of 0.5–2 μg/mL; whereas a level of 0.11 μg/mL (2 μM) of Fe+3 was the optimum for day 2 embryos. Levels of ferric iron at 0.11 to 2.8 μg/mL appear to enhance spermatozoa motility, preserve its DNA integrity and possibly increase percentage of blastocysts developed but levels of ferric iron &gt;16 μg/mL is hazardous for both spermatozoa and embryos. In spite of beneficial effects of iron it is premature to recommend its supplementation in embryo culture media because of the known deleterious nature of iron and the paucity of toxicological data. Toxicological studies must be performed following which it can be decided whether it is safe to consider iron as a supplement in human embryo and spermatozoa culture media. ? 2017 Society for Biology of Reproduction & the Institute of Animal Reproduction and Food Research of Polish Academy of Sciences in Olsztyn",Blastocyst; DNA integrity; Embryo; Iron; Spermatozoa,iron; animal; chemistry; culture medium; DNA damage; drug effect; embryo culture; embryo development; human; male; mouse; physiology; spermatozoon; spermatozoon motility; Animals; Culture Media; DNA Damage; Embryo Culture Techniques; Embryonic Development; Humans; Iron; Male; Mice; Sperm Motility; Spermatozoa,2-s2.0-85019880805

Hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are two main modifiable health risk factors for heart disease. In a fast ageing society, proper preventive measures should be adopted, particularly to achieve healthy aging. The objective of the present study is to examine the factors affecting the use of two health tests, namely blood cholesterol and blood pressure screenings among adults aged 60 years and above in Malaysia. Nationally representative data collected through the National Health and Morbidity Survey 2011 (NHMS, 2011) by the Ministry of Health, Malaysia were analysed. The survey used a two-stage stratified sampling method. Enumeration Blocks were selected in the first stage, while the second stage involved selection of Living Quarters. The proportions of those not using the blood cholesterol (45.4%) and blood pressure (30.8%) tests are alarmingly high. A bivariate probit model is applied to examine the determinants of the use of these two health screening tests. The results show that education, ethnicity, location of residence, employment status, health insurance and smoking significantly affect the decision of the aged population to undergo these tests. Key findings are, first, time is a more dominant factor than income in determining health screening behaviour among the aged population. Second, being covered by insurance increases the propensity to undergo health screening. Third, smokers have a lower likelihood of screening than non-smokers. The findings suggest that intervention programmes should be targeted at the less-educated, employed individuals, individuals not covered by health insurance and smokers. ? 2017 Western Social Science Association",Health; Insurance; Lifestyle; Screening; Socioeconomic factors,,2-s2.0-85017165934

Prior research in bipolar disorder has reported value from online support groups. Aims: To understand the use of online support groups by patients with bipolar disorder as part of a larger project about information seeking. Methods: The results are based on a one-time, paper-based anonymous survey about information seeking by patients with bipolar disorder, which was translated into 12 languages. The survey was completed between March 2014 and January 2016 and included questions on the use of online support groups. All patients were diagnosed by a psychiatrist. Analysis included descriptive statistics and general estimating equations to account for correlated data. Results and conclusions: The survey was completed by 1222 patients in 17 countries. The patients used the Internet at a percentage similar to the general public. Of the Internet users who looked online for information about bipolar disorder, only 21.0% read or participated in support groups, chats, or forums for bipolar disorder (12.8% of the total sample). Given the benefits reported in prior research, clarification of the role of online support groups in bipolar disorder is needed. With only a minority of patients using online support groups, there are analytical challenges for future studies. ? 2017 The Nordic Psychiatric Association.",Bipolar disorder; Internet; online support groups; self-help; survey,adult; age; Article; bipolar I disorder; bipolar II disorder; disease duration; female; health survey; human; Internet; major clinical study; male; peer group; self help; sex difference; support group; urban area; bipolar disorder; international cooperation; Internet; middle aged; psychology; questionnaire; utilization; Adult; Bipolar Disorder; Female; Humans; Internationality; Internet; Male; Middle Aged; Self-Help Groups; Surveys and Questionnaires,2-s2.0-85023178963

The NIS is a brief, self-report measure originally designed to assess NCI by having individuals rate a range of items that may influence cognitive functioning. HIV-infected male prisoners (N?=?301) administered the full 95-item NIS. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was conducted using principal axis factoring and orthogonal varimax rotation. Reliability was measured using Cronbach’s alpha. The EFA resulted in an abbreviated, psychometrically sound, eight-factor structure (54-item) revised NIS—now referred to as the Brief Inventory of Neuro-cognitive Impairment—Malaysia (BINI-M). It is better designed to detect NCI in PLWH, ranging from generalized neurocognitive symptoms to more specific forms of impairment with excellent to average reliability. The BINI-M may serve as a useful tool for clinicians and researchers to assess NCI in PLWH and can inform enhanced treatment strategies in the Malaysian context. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Exploratory factor analysis; Malaysia; Neurocognitive impairment; Neuropsychological Impairment Scale; Opioid dependence; Prisoners,,2-s2.0-85016936937

This study aimed to examine the apoptosis mechanisms induced by BM in a murine monomyelocytic cell line (WEHI-3) in vitro and in vivo. Methods: A WEHI-3 cell line was used to evaluate the cytotoxicity of BM by MTT. AO/PI and Hoechst 33342 dyes, Annexin V, multiparametric cytotoxicity 3 by high content screening (HCS); cell cycle tests were used to estimate the features of apoptosis and BM effects. Caspase 3 and 9 activities, ROS, western blot for Bcl2, and Bax were detected to study the mechanism of apoptosis. BALB/c mice injected with WEHI-3 cells were used to assess the apoptotic effect of BM in vivo. Results: BM suppressed the growth of WEHI-3 cells at an IC50value of 14 ± 3 μg/mL in 24 h. The ROS production was increased inside the cells in the treated doses. Both caspases (9 and 3) were activated in treating WEHI-3 cells at 24, 48 and 72 h. Different signs of apoptosis were detected, such as cell membrane blebbing, DNA segmentation and changes in the asymmetry of the cell membrane.

The gold standard treatment for chronic infection after hip arthroplasty is a two-stage protocol: eradication of infection, follow by re-implantation arthroplasty. The use of interim antibiotic-laden cement spacer has become a popular procedure to maintain hip joint function and provide antibiotic elution simultaneously before re-implantation. However, antibiotic cement spacer is mechanically weak and breaks if overloaded. Therefore, we designed a cement mould with metallic endoskeleton with the aim of creating a stronger, inexpensive, antibiotic-impregnated spacer resembling a unipolar arthroplasty. We report two cases of severe hip joint infection after implant fixation (bipolar hemiarthroplasty, screw fixation neck of femur). Both patients had undergone first stage surgery of debridement and articulating antibiotic cement insertion using our design. Although the second stage surgery was planned for these patients, both patients delayed the operation in view of good functional status after a year walking with the antibiotic cement spacer. These cases showed that the mechanical property of the new antibiotic cement spacer was promising but further mechanical studies upon this new endoskeleton design are required. ? 2017, Malaysian Orthopaedic Association.

Two-level linear regression analysis was performed to remove the cluster effect of the variables. The mean BMI of married non-pregnant Bangladeshi women was 21.60±3.86 kg/m2, and the prevalence of underweight, overweight and obesity was 22.8%, 14.9% and 3.2%, respectively. After removing the cluster effect, age and age at first marriage were found to be positively (p&lt;0.01) related with BMI. Number of children was negatively related with women's BMI. Lower BMI was especially found among women from rural areas and poor families, with an uneducated husband, with no television at home and who were currently breast-feeding. Age, total children ever born, age at first marriage, type of residence, education level, level of husband's education, wealth index, having a television at home and practising breast-feeding were found to be important predictors for the BMI of married Bangladeshi non-pregnant women of reproductive age.

While gene expression-based prognostic assays may aid management of women with early estrogen receptor (ER) positive tumors, therapeutic decision-making in women with early stage ER negative tumors remains fraught with difficulties. We investigated the association between adjuvant chemotherapy and overall survival in women with T1N0M0, hormone receptor negative breast cancers. Method All newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with node-negative and hormone receptor negative tumors measuring ? 2 cm at the University Malaya Medical Centre (Malaysia) from 1993 to 2013 were included. Mortality of patients with and without adjuvant chemotherapy were compared and adjusted for possible confounders using propensity score. Results Of 6732 breast cancer patients, 341 (5.1%) had small (?2 cm), node-negative and hormone receptor negative tumors at diagnosis. Among them, only 214 (62.8%) received adjuvant chemotherapy. Five-year overall survival was 88.1% (95% confidence interval (CI): 82.0%–94.2%) for patients receiving chemotherapy and 89.6% (95% CI: 85.1%–94.1%) for patients without chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was not associated with survival following adjustment for age, ethnicity, tumor size, tumor grade, HER2 status, lympho-vascular invasion, type of surgery and radiotherapy administration. However, chemotherapy was associated with a significant survival advantage (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.35, 95%CI: 0.14–0.91) in a subgroup of women with high-grade tumors. Conclusion Adjuvant chemotherapy does not appear to be associated with a survival benefit in women with T1N0M0, hormone receptor negative breast cancer except in those with high-grade tumors. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Asia; Chemotherapy; Hormone receptor negative breast cancer; Survival; T1N0M0 breast cancer,"antineoplastic agent; cyclophosphamide; docetaxel; doxorubicin; epidermal growth factor receptor 2; epirubicin; fluorouracil; hormone receptor; methotrexate; paclitaxel; trastuzumab; adult; age; Article; breast cancer; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer grading; cancer mortality; cancer size; cancer staging; cancer survival; controlled study; ethnicity; female; hormone receptor negative breast cancer; human; lymph vessel metastasis; major clinical study; Malaysia; middle aged; overall survival; priority journal; propensity score; survival rate; survival time; treatment outcome; adjuvant chemotherapy; Breast Neoplasms; mortality; pathology; procedures; prognosis; survival analysis; Breast Neoplasms; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Prognosis; Survival Analysis",2-s2.0-85016477559

OSA is now recognized as a disorder with systemic manifestations and its association with obesity and adverse cardiovascular consequences. There is increasing evidence that OSA may be associated with systemic hypertension and an increased incidence of stroke, heart failure, myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias. Less information is available about the association between OSA and pulmonary hypertension (PH). We therefore conduct this study to look at the prevalence of the pulmonary hypertension in obstructive sleep apnea patient and to identify risk factors leading to pulmonary hypertension among OSA patient. We studied and analyzed all OSA patient confirmed by polysomnograph in the year 2015. Twenty-five patients with OSA were included in this study with prevalence of pulmonary hypertension of 16%. Univariate analysis of various factors revealed a statistically significant association between having the lowest SpO2 of &lt;70% and pulmonary hypertension (p = 0.016). There were no statistically significant associations between age, gender, smoking status, hypertension, body mass index (BMI), or apnea–hypopnea index (AHI) with occurrence of pulmonary hypertension. AHI is not a good predictor for pulmonary hypertension. The real value of using AHI to predict the health risk of OSA is doubtful. We recommend routine echocardiogram among OSA patient. The objective information in the echocardiogram provides evidence for counseling of patient with disease of OSA and hence hopefully can improve compliance of patient to treatment especially usage of CPAP. ? 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Cardiovascular disease; Echocardiography; Obstructive sleep apnea; Pulmonary hypertension,"adult; aged; apnea hypopnea index; arterial wall thickness; Article; cardiovascular disease; clinical article; cross-sectional study; diastolic dysfunction; echocardiography; female; health hazard; heart ventricle hypertrophy; human; male; observational study; polysomnography; prevalence; priority journal; pulmonary hypertension; risk assessment; risk factor; sleep disordered breathing; univariate analysis; analysis of variance; blood; body mass; complication; echocardiography; hypertension; incidence; middle aged; obesity; pathophysiology; pulmonary hypertension; sleep disordered breathing; oxygen; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Body Mass Index; Echocardiography; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Hypertension, Pulmonary; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Obesity; Oxygen; Polysomnography; Prevalence; Risk Factors; Sleep Apnea, Obstructive",2-s2.0-85014018211

Robust clinical data on spasticity progression, associated symptoms development and functional impairment is scarce. Additionally, maximal duration of muscle tone reduction following botulinum toxin type A (BoNT-A) injections remains undetermined. The ONTIME pilot study aims to explore these issues and evaluate whether abobotulinumtoxinA 500 U (Dysport?; Ipsen) administered intramuscularly within 12 weeks following stroke delays the appearance or progression of symptomatic (disabling) upper limb spasticity (ULS). Methods ONTIME is a 28-week, phase 4, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, exploratory pilot study initiated at four centres across Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Subjects (n = 42) with moderate to severe ULS (modified Ashworth scale [MAS] score ?2) in elbow flexors or pronators, wrist flexors, or finger flexors will be recruited. Subjects will be randomised 2:1 to abobotulinumtoxinA 500 U or placebo (single dose 2–12 weeks after first-ever stroke). Primary efficacy will be measured by time between initial injection and visit at which reinjection criteria (MAS score ?2 in the primary targeted muscle group and appearance or reappearance of symptomatic ULS) are met. Follow-up visits will be 4-weekly to a maximum of 28 weeks. Discussion This pilot study will facilitate the design and sample size calculation of further confirmatory studies, and is expected to provide insights into the optimal management of post-stroke patients, including timing of BoNT-A therapy and follow-up duration. ? 2017",AbobotulinumtoxinA; BoNT-A; Botulinum neurotoxin type A; Modified Ashworth scale; Post-stroke; Upper limb spasticity,botulinum toxin A; placebo; adult; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; clinical protocol; controlled study; disease course; double blind procedure; drug effect; drug efficacy; drug use; female; functional assessment; human; Malaysia; male; modified Ashworth Scale; multicenter study; muscle tone; outcome assessment; phase 4 clinical trial; Philippines; pilot study; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rating scale; Singapore; spasticity; Thailand,2-s2.0-85013981626

Since HCV has a large inactive surface, we would like to hypothesis that the mutation occur in HCV is minimal and causing less resistance against inhibition. In this study, a short peptide inhibitor of HCV namely plectasin was identified by HCV NS3-4A serine protease assay. Plectasin peptide showed considerable inhibition against HCV NS3-4A serine protease. Enzymatic activity of the recombinant NS3-4Apro was analysed by fluorescence release from several fluorogenic peptide substrates which resembling the dibasic cleavage site sequences of the flavivirus polyprotein precursor. Of all amc-labelled peptides, Pyr-RTKR-amc was the most efficiently cleaved substrate with the lowest Km value of 20??M. The kinetic assay showed that plectasin peptide inhibited NS3-4Apro activity with an IC50 value of 4.3?μM compared to the aprotinin as a standard proteases inhibitor with an IC50 of 6.1?μM. From the results, plectasin peptide also demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of HCV replication with a considerable reduction in RLuc activity at 15??M using HCV replicon- containing Huh-7 cells. Our study has identified a unique natural peptide that can be used to highlight novel structures for the development of drug derivatives with high efficacy of HCV NS3-4A protease inhibitors. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Antiviral peptide; HCV replicon assay; Hepatitis C virus; NS3-4A serine protease; Plectasin,aprotinin; hepacivirin; plectasin; Article; concentration response; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; Hepatitis C virus; IC50; molecular docking; nonhuman; replicon; virus inhibition,2-s2.0-84982902908

As a post-secular development, these changes suggest that the secular cannot be seen to reign supreme but needs to be treated as coexisting with the other categories. Changes in one would imply corresponding changes in the others. Yet it can also be argued that these changes underlie a common concern with the question of human mortality. If religion is ultimately concerned with death and the transcendental future, then its relation to spirituality and secularity would also elicit alternative ways of addressing the meaning of dying. The post-secular is not only a platform for deconstructing dichotomous categories but also for reviving the meaning of dying as central to these categories. ? 2017 International Journal of Philosophy and Theology.",Mortality; post-secular; religion; spirituality,,2-s2.0-85013168632

However, both drugs are only recommended for the patients who have pre-treatment HIV RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL. In resource-limited settings, pre-treatment HIV RNA is not routinely performed and not widely available. The aims of this study are to determine factors associated with pre-treatment HIV RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL and to construct a model to predict this outcome. Methods: HIV-infected adults enrolled in the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database were eligible if they had an HIV RNA measurement documented at the time of ART initiation. The dataset was randomly split into a derivation data set (75% of patients) and a validation data set (25%). Factors associated with pre-treatment HIV RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL were evaluated by logistic regression adjusted for study site. A prediction model and prediction scores were created. Results: A total of 2592 patients were enrolled for the analysis. Median [interquartile range (IQR)] age was 35.8 (29.9-42.5) years; CD4 count was 147 (50-248) cells/mm3; and pre-treatment HIV RNA was 100,000 (34,045-301,075) copies/mL. Factors associated with pre-treatment HIV RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL were age &lt;30 years [OR 1.40 vs. 41-50 years; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.10-1.80, p = 0.01], body mass index &gt;30 kg/m2 (OR 2.4 vs. &lt;18.5 kg/m2; 95% CI 1.1-5.1, p = 0.02), anemia (OR 1.70; 95% CI 1.40-2.10, p &lt; 0.01), CD4 count &gt;350 cells/mm3 (OR 3.9 vs. &lt;100 cells/mm3; 95% CI 2.0-4.1, p &lt; 0.01), total lymphocyte count &gt;2000 cells/mm3 (OR 1.7 vs. &lt;1000 cells/mm3; 95% CI 1.3-2.3, p &lt; 0.01), and no prior AIDS-defining illness (OR 1.8; 95% CI 1.5-2.3, p &lt; 0.01). Receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) analysis yielded area under the curve of 0.70 (95% CI 0.67-0.72) among derivation patients and 0.69 (95% CI 0.65-0.74) among validation patients. A cut off score &gt;25 yielded the sensitivity of 46.7%, specificity of 79.1%, positive predictive value of 67.7%, and negative predictive value of 61.2% for prediction of pre-treatment HIV RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL among derivation patients. Conclusion: A model prediction for pre-treatment HIV RNA &lt;100,000 copies/mL produced an area under the ROC curve of 0.70.

F. Var. Glabra (Kochummen), also known as “Medang payung” by the Malay people, belongs to the Lauraceae family. In this study, methanol leaf extract of A. sesquipedalis was investigated for their acute toxicity and gastroprotective effects to reduce ulcers in rat stomachs induced by ethanol. The rats were assigned to one of five groups: normal group (group 1), ulcer group (group 2), control positive drug group (group 3) and two experimental groups treated with 150 mg/kg (group 4) and 300 mg/kg (group 5) of leaf extract. The rats were sacrificed an hour after pretreatment with extracts, and their stomach homogenates and tissues were collected for further evaluation. Macroscopic and histological analyses showed that gastric ulcers in rats pretreated with the extract were significantly reduced to an extent that it allowed leukocytes penetration of the gastric walls compared with the ulcer group. In addition, an ulcer inhibition rate of >70% was detected in rats treated with both doses of A. sesquipedalis extract, showing a notable protection of gastric layer. Severe destruction of gastric mucosa was prevented with a high production of mucus and pH gastric contents in both omeprazole-treated and extract-treated groups. Meanwhile, an increase in glycoprotein uptake was observed in pretreated rats through accumulation of magenta color in Periodic Acid Schiff staining assay. Analysis of gastric homogenate from pretreated rats showed a reduction of malondialdehyde and elevation of nitric oxide, glutathione, prostaglandin E2, superoxide dismutase and protein concentration levels in comparison with group 2. Suppression of apoptosis in gastric tissues by upregulation of Hsp70 protein and downregulation of Bax protein was also observed in rats pretreated with extract. Consistent results of a reduction of gastric ulcer and the protection of gastric wall were obtained for rats pretreated with A. sesquipedalis extract, which showed its prominent gastroprotective potential in rats’ stomach against ethanol-induced ulcer. ? 2017 Omar et al.",Actinodaphne sesquipedalis; Ethanol; Gastric ulcer; Mechanism; Methanol extracts,"Actinodaphne sesquipedalis extract; alcohol; antiulcer agent; glutathione; glycoprotein; heat shock protein 70; malonaldehyde; methanol; nitric oxide; omeprazole; plant extract; prostaglandin E2; protein Bax; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; antiulcer agent; plant extract; Actinodaphne sesquipedalis; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antioxidant activity; apoptosis; Article; comparative effectiveness; controlled study; drug megadose; drug screening; female; Lauraceae; low drug dose; male; mucus; nonhuman; protein transport; rat; stomach pH; stomach protection; stomach ulcer; toxicity testing; animal; chemically induced; chemistry; disease model; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; isolation and purification; mouse; pathology; plant leaf; stomach ulcer; Animals; Anti-Ulcer Agents; Disease Models, Animal; Ethanol; Female; Lauraceae; Male; Methanol; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Plant Extracts; Plant Leaves; Rats; Stomach Ulcer",2-s2.0-85019268210

Setting Tertiary level teaching institution in Malaysia. Participants The validation process involved 211 adult patients (English language n=101, Malay language n=110) with chronic liver disease. Characteristics of the study subjects were as follows: mean (SD) age was 56 (12.8) years, 58.3% were male and 41.7% female. The inclusion criteria were patients 18 years or older with chronic hepatitis and/or liver cirrhosis of any aetiology. The exclusion criteria were as follows: presence of hepatic encephalopathy, ongoing treatment with interferon and presence of other chronic conditions that have an impact on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted. Cultural adaptation of the English version of the CLDQ was performed, and a Malay version was developed following standard forward-backward translation by independent native speakers. Psychometric properties of both versions were determined by assessing their internal consistency, test-retest reliability and discriminant and convergent validity. Results Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency across the various domains of the CLDQ was 0.95 for the English version and 0.92 for the Malay version. Test-retest analysis showed excellent reliability with an intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.89 for the English version and 0.93 for the Malay version. The average scores of both the English and Malay versions of the CLDQ demonstrated adequate discriminant validity by differentiating between non-cirrhosis (English 6.3, Malay 6.1), compensated cirrhosis (English 5.6, Malay 6.0) and decompensated cirrhosis (English 5.1, Malay 4.9) (p<0.001).

Design Conversation analysis of seven single cases of audio-recorded/video-recorded consultations between doctors and patients with type 2 diabetes, using a PDA on starting insulin. Setting Primary care in three healthcare settings: (1) one private clinic; (2) two public community clinics and (3) one primary care clinic in a public university hospital, in Negeri Sembilan and the Klang Valley in Malaysia. Participants Clinicians and seven patients with type 2 diabetes to whom insulin had been recommended. Purposive sampling was used to select a sample high in variance across healthcare settings, participant demographics and perspectives on insulin. Primary outcome measures Interaction between doctors and patients in a clinical consultation involving the use of a PDA about starting insulin. Results Doctors brought the PDA into the conversation mainly by asking information-focused ?  yes/no' questions, and used the PDA for information exchange only if patients said they had not read it. While their contributions were limited by doctors' questions, some patients disclosed issues or concerns. Although doctors' PDA-related questions acted as a presequence to deliberation on starting insulin, their interactional practices raised questions on whether patients were informed and their preferences prioritised. Conclusions Interactional practices can hinder effective PDA implementation, with habits from ordinary conversation potentially influencing doctors' practices and complicating their implementation of patient-centred decision-making. Effective interaction should therefore be emphasised in the design and delivery of PDAs and in training clinicians to use them. ?

NiV infection is initiated after binding of the viral G glycoprotein to the host cell receptor. The aim of this study was to map the NiV G glycoprotein cell binding domain using a phage display system. The NiV G extracellular domain was truncated and displayed as attachment proteins on M13 phage g3p minor coat protein. The binding efficiency of recombinant phages displaying different regions of NiV G to mammalian cells was evaluated. Results showed that regions of NiV G consisting of amino acids 396–602 (recombinant phage G4) and 498–602 (recombinant phage G5) demonstrated the highest binding to both Vero (5.5 × 103 cfu/ml and 5.6 × 103 cfu/ml) and THP-1 cells (3.5 × 103 cfu/ml and 2.9 × 103 cfu/ml). However, the binding of both of these recombinant phages to THP-1 cells was significantly lower than to Vero cells, and this could be due to the lack of primary host cell receptor expression on THP-1 cells. Furthermore, the binding between these two recombinant phages was competitive suggesting that there was a common host cell attachment site. This study employed an approach that is suitable for use in a biosafety level 2 containment laboratory without the need to use live virus to show that NiV G amino acids 498–602 play an important role for attachment to host cells. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Glycoprotein; Host cell receptor; Infectious disease; Nipah virus; Phage display,coat protein; ephrin B2; ephrin B3; G glycoprotein; genomic DNA; glycoprotein; hybrid protein; unclassified drug; viral protein; glycoprotein; peptide library; protein binding; viral protein; animal cell; antibiotic resistance; Article; bacterium colony; binding affinity; binding competition; carboxy terminal sequence; colony forming unit; controlled study; Enterobacteria phage M13; gene fusion; gene insertion; gene sequence; mammal cell; monocyte; Nipah virus; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phage display; phagemid; protein expression; sequence homology; stop codon; THP 1 cell; Vero cell line; virus cell interaction; virus recombinant; animal; binding site; cell line; Chlorocebus aethiops; genetics; human; metabolism; Nipah virus; peptide library; physiology; protein domain; virus attachment; Animals; Bacteriophage M13; Binding Sites; Cell Line; Cercopithecus aethiops; Glycoproteins; Humans; Nipah Virus; Peptide Library; Protein Binding; Protein Domains; Viral Structural Proteins; Virus Attachment,2-s2.0-85010288071

Therefore, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of mono-culture and co-culture inoculation of isolated biofilm-forming bacteria with the blood disease pathogen in banana pseudostems in glasshouse conditions. Putative biofilm-forming bacteria were isolated from an infected banana plant and were further identified using 16SrRNA sequencing. Four isolates, identified as Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterobacter cloacae, Kosakonia radicincitans and Klebsiella pneumoniae, were inoculated as a mono- and co-culture with R. syzygii subsp. celebesensis into 2?months old banana plants. The observation after the 8?weeks of post inoculation showed that plants which were co-inoculated with the pathogen and K. radicincitans, a biofilm-forming bacterium, were the most susceptible towards the infection. In contrast, plants under two treatments (which were co-inoculated with the pathogen and E. cloacae and the pathogen with E. hormaechei) were less susceptible towards the infection. This study revealed the antagonistic effects of two biofilm-forming strains which reduced the severity of infection caused by the pathogenic agent. Scanning electron micrographs of the cross section of plant rhizomes indicated the dissimilarity of adhesion and host colonization conditions of the pathogen in each infected plant from different treatments. ? 2016, Koninklijke Nederlandse Planteziektenkundige Vereniging.",Antagonism; Bacterial wilt disease; Co-inoculation; Musa acuminata cv.

Wuchereria bancrofti, W. kalimantani Palmieri, Pulnomo, Dennis and Marwoto, 1980 and six out of ten Brugia spp. have been described from Australia, Southeast Asia, Sri Lanka and India. However, the origin and evolution of the species in the Wuchereria-Brugia clade remain unclear. While investigating the diversity of filarial parasites in Malaysia, we discovered an undescribed species in the common treeshrew Tupaia glis Diard and Duvaucel (Mammalia: Scandentia). Methods: We examined 81 common treeshrews from 14 areas in nine states and the Federal Territory of Peninsular Malaysia for filarial parasites. Once any filariae that were found had been isolated, we examined their morphological characteristics and determined the partial sequences of their mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) and 12S rRNA genes. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) region were then cloned into the pGEM-T vector, and the recombinant plasmids were used as templates for sequencing. Results: Malayfilaria sofiani Uni, Mat Udin and Takaoka, n. g., n. sp. is described based on the morphological characteristics of adults and microfilariae found in common treeshrews from Jeram Pasu, Kelantan, Malaysia. The Kimura 2-parameter distance between the cox1 gene sequences of the new species and W. bancrofti was 11.8%. Based on the three gene sequences, the new species forms a monophyletic clade with W. bancrofti and Brugia spp. The adult parasites were found in tissues surrounding the lymph nodes of the neck of common treeshrews. Conclusions: The newly described species appears most closely related to Wuchereria spp. and Brugia spp., but differs from these in several morphological characteristics. Molecular analyses based on the cox1 and 12S rRNA genes and the ITS1 region indicated that this species differs from both W. bancrofti and Brugia spp. at the genus level. We thus propose a new genus, Malayfilaria, along with the new species M. sofiani. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Filarial nematodes; Lymphatic filariosis; Molecular identification; Onchocercidae; Scandentia; Southeast Asia,"RNA 12S; ribosomal spacer DNA; Article; Brugia malayi; Brugia pahangi; cladistics; controlled study; cox1 gene; female; Filarioidea; gene; gene sequence; genetic similarity; Malayfilaria sofiani; Malaysia; male; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; parasite identification; parasite isolation; parasite prevalence; phylogenetic tree; polymerase chain reaction; sequence analysis; species difference; Tupaia glis; anatomy and histology; animal; Brugia; DNA sequence; filariasis; Filarioidea; genetics; isolation and purification; parasitology; Tupaia; veterinary; Wuchereria; Animals; Brugia; DNA, Ribosomal Spacer; Female; Filariasis; Filarioidea; Malaysia; Male; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Tupaia; Wuchereria",2-s2.0-85018466088

Objectives: The purpose of this study was to obtain the quantitative DCE-MRI parameters of symptomatic uterine fibroids and compare to the parameters obtained from normal myometrium, endometrium, and cervix. Patients and Methods: Nineteen patients (aged 40 ± 5 years) with the clinical diagnosis of uterine fibroids were recruited. After routine MRI pelvis scan, DCE-MRI was performed using T1 volumetric liver acquisition with volume acceleration (LAVA) sequence. The data were post-processed using an independent DCE-MRI analysis software. ROI was drawn on the fibroid and the quantitative DCE-MRI parameters i.e. Ktrans (volume transfer between the blood plasma and extracellular fluid), Kep [flux rate constant between the extracellular extravascular space (EES) and blood plasma], Ve (EES fractional volume), and semi-quantitative parameters i.e. TTP (time to peak), and IAUGC (initial area under the gadolinium concentration-time curve) were determined. The patients then underwent hysterectomy and uterine fibroids were confirmed in all the patients by histopathology results. In the control group, fifteen healthy volunteers (aged 32 ± 6 years) who did not have uterine fibroid confirmed by sonography examination were recruited. The volunteers underwent the same DCE-MRI scan as the patients and the quantitative DCE-MRI parameters of the normal myometrium, endometrium and cervix were obtained. The DCE-MRI parameters from these two groups were then compared. Results: The median Ktrans in the myometrium, endometrium and cervix of the healthy volunteers were 0.26 ± 0.13, 0.20 ± 0.15, and 0.30 ± 0.13 min-1, respectively. No statistical significant difference was found in all the DCE-MRI parameters between the myometrium, endometrium and cervix of the healthy volunteers. The median Ktrans in fibroids was 0.50 ± 0.25 min-1. There were statistically significant differences (P &lt; 0.05) found in Ktrans and Ve between the normal myometrium and fibroid tissue. Conclusions: The Ktrans and Ve of fibroid tissue were statistically significantly higher than those obtained from the normal myometrium, whereby the suggested cut-off values were 0.47 min-1 (sensitivity 64.7%, specificity 92.3%) and 0.62 (sensitivity 70.6%, specificity 78.6%), respectively.

Based on WHR cutoff points, 57% of subjects had abdominal obesity (?0.85) while the remaining were without abdominal obesity (<0.85). Lower percentages of abdominal obesity prevalence were reported for both WC and WHR categories using manual measurements. We also found that in normal BMI category, 8.5% of subjects have mild abdominal obesity based on automated measurements while only 5.5% of subjects were identified on manual measurements.

Glycation ensues in diabetes and glycated proteins cause insulin resistance in brain resulting in amyloid plaques and NFTs. Also glycation enhances gliosis by promoting neuroinflammation. Currently there is no therapy available to target neurodegenration in brain therefore, development of new therapy that offers neuroprotection is critical. The objective of this study was to evaluate mechanistic effect of isatin derivative URM-II-81, an anti-glycation agent for improvement of insulin action in brain and inhibition of neurodegenration. Methylglyoxal induced stress was inhibited by treatment with URM-II-81. Also, Ser473 and Ser9 phosphorylation of Akt and GSK-3β respectively were restored by URM-II-81. Effect of URM-II-81 on axonal integrity was studied by differentiating Neuro2A using retinoic acid. URM-II-81 restored axonal length in MGO treated cells. Its effects were also studied in high fat and low dose streptozotocin induced diabetic mice where it reduced RBG levels and inhibited glycative stress by reducing HbA1c. URM-II-81 treatment also showed inhibition of gliosis in hippocampus. Histological analysis showed reduced NFTs in CA3 hippocampal region and restoration of insulin signaling in hippocampii of diabetic mice. Our findings suggest that URM-II-81 can be developed as a new therapeutic agent for treatment of neurodegenration. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Gliosis; Neurodegenration; Neurofibrillary tangles; Schiff base; Tau,"3 (3 bromophenylimino)indolin 2 one; agents affecting metabolism; brain protein; gsk 3beta protein; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; isatin derivative; methylglyoxal; neuroprotective agent; protein kinase B; retinoic acid; Schiff base; serine; streptozocin; unclassified drug; advanced glycation end product; insulin; isatin; monoamine oxidase inhibitor; animal experiment; Article; brain function; brain histology; controlled study; cytotoxicity; drug effect; drug mechanism; gliosis; glycation; hippocampal CA3 region; histopathology; lipid diet; low drug dose; male; mouse; nerve cell; nerve degeneration; nonhuman; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; streptozotocin-induced diabetes mellitus; analogs and derivatives; animal; antagonists and inhibitors; Bagg albino mouse; brain; cell survival; chemistry; dose response; drug effects; experimental diabetes mellitus; metabolism; pathology; physiology; signal transduction; tumor cell line; Animals; Brain; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Survival; Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Glycation End Products, Advanced; Insulin; Isatin; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors; Signal Transduction",2-s2.0-85011049523

There is increasing evidence H. pylori protects against the development of obesity and childhood asthma/allergies in which the development of these diseases coincide with transient dysbiosis. However, the mechanism underlying the association of H. pylori eradication with human metabolic and immunological disorders is not well-established. In this study, we aimed to investigate the local and systemic effects of H. pylori eradication through untargeted fecal lipidomics and plasma metabolomics approaches by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Results: Our study revealed that eradication of H. pylori eradication (i.e., loss of H. pylori and/or H. pylori eradication therapy) changed many global metabolite/lipid features, with the majority being down-regulated. Our findings primarily show that H. pylori eradication affects the host energy and lipid metabolism which may eventually lead to the development of metabolic disorders. Conclusion: These predictive metabolic signatures of metabolic and immunological disorders following H. pylori eradication can provide insights into dynamic local and systemic metabolism related to H. pylori eradication in modulating human health. ? 2017 Yap, Leow, Azmi, Callahan, Perez-Perez, Loke, Goh and Vadivelu.",Fecal; Helicobacter pylori; Lipidomics; Metabolomics; Plasma,amoxicillin; clarithromycin; levofloxacin; pantoprazole; proton pump inhibitor; rabeprazole; adult; allergy; Article; asthma; bacterial clearance; bacterial colonization; controlled study; down regulation; dysbiosis; eradication therapy; feces analysis; female; follow up; Helicobacter infection; Helicobacter pylori; high performance liquid chromatography; human; immunomodulation; immunopathology; lipid metabolism; lipidomics; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; major clinical study; male; metabolomics; nonhuman; obesity; pathogen clearance; retention time; stomach mucosa; urea breath test,2-s2.0-85016644593

Although Malay is their national language, English is widely used as the lingua franca among Malaysians of different ethnicities. This study aimed to validate an English version of the PIDAQ adapted for use by Malaysian adolescents to optimize data capture from adolescents who prefer English as the medium for communication. Methods: The published English version of PIDAQ was pilot tested on 12- to 17-year-old adolescents, resulting in a few modifications to suit the Malaysian variety of English. Psychometric properties were tested on 393 adolescents who attended orthodontic practices and selected schools. Malocclusion was assessed using the Malocclusion Index, an aggregation of Perception of Occlusion Scale and the Aesthetic Component of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need, by the subjects (MI-S) and investigators (MI-D). Data were analysed for internal consistency and age-associated invariance, discriminant, construct and criterion validities, reproducibility and floor and ceiling effects using AMOS v.20 and SPSS v.20. Results: The item Don't like own teeth on video of the Aesthetic Concern (AC) subscale was not relevant to a large proportion of participants (11.7%). Therefore, it was removed and the Malaysian English PIDAQ was analysed based on 22 items instead of 23 items. Confirmatory factor analysis showed good fit statistics (comparative fit index: 0.902, root-mean-square error of approximation: 0.066). Internal consistency was good for the Dental Self-Confidence, Social Impact and Psychological Impact subscales (Cronbach's alpha: 0.70-0.95) but lower (0.52-0.62) though acceptable for the AC subscale as it consisted of only 2 items. The reproducibility test was acceptable (intra-class correlations: 0.53-0.78). For all PIDAQ subscales, the MI-S and MI-D scores of those with severe malocclusion differed significantly from those with no or slight malocclusion. There were significant associations between the PIDAQ subscales with ranking of perceived dental appearance, need for braces and impact of malocclusion on daily activities. There were no floor or ceiling effects. Conclusion: The adapted Malaysian English PIDAQ demonstrated adequate psychometric properties that are valid and reliable for assessment of psychological impacts of dental aesthetics among Malaysian adolescents. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Adolescent; Cross-cultural adaptation; Impact-related need; Malocclusion; Oral health-related quality of life; Patient-reported outcome measure,"adolescent; Aesthetic Component of the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need; age associated invariance validity; age distribution; Article; assessment of humans; behavior; ceiling effect; child; construct validity; controlled study; criterion related validity; data analysis; data capture; dental self confidence; discriminant validity; disease severity; error; female; floor effect; human; internal consistency; interpersonal communication; Malaysian; male; malocclusion; Malocclusion Index; orthodontics; Perception of Occlusion Scale; process optimization; psychological impact; psychometry; Psychosocial Impact of Dental Aesthetics Questionnaire English version; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; reproducibility; root mean square error; school child; social aspect; social impact; statistical parameters; validation study; validity; adolescent; dental procedure; language; Malaysia; malocclusion; psychology; questionnaire; self concept; self evaluation; standards; validation study; Adolescent; Esthetics, Dental; Female; Humans; Language; Malaysia; Male; Malocclusion; Psychometrics; Quality of Life; Reproducibility of Results; Self Concept; Self-Assessment; Surveys and Questionnaires",2-s2.0-85016135543

Although a variety of programmes and promotional campaigns have been organised and promoted by the agencies responsible for handling the organ donation, the number of donors is still at a discouraging level. Therefore, the objective of this study is to analyse the perceptions of young generation in regard to organ donation. Random samplings of 387 respondents consisting of undergraduate students at University of Malaya were selected for this study. The study found that young people's perceptions were very much influenced by their family members and friends, as well as family history. There is a significant difference between mean of gender and willingness towards organ donation and transplantation (t = -2.60, df = 385, p = <.05). The Spearman correlation shows a positive but weak correlation between the intention of the surveyed students towards registering as donors and their perceptions about organ donation and transplantation (r = .354, p <0.05). In sum, discussions on the issue of organ donation and transplantation should be held regularly in Higher Learning Institutions in order to change the misperceptions and misconceptions of the younger generation about organ donation and transplantation. ?

Prostate specific antigen (PSA) is a widely used tumor marker for prostate cancer. Recently, PSA is discovered in non-prostatic cancer tissues in men and women raising doubts about its specificity for prostatic tissues. PSA exists in low serum level in healthy men and in higher levels in many prostate disorders, including prostatitis and prostate cancer. Thus, a supplementary tumor marker is needed to accurately diagnose the cancer and to observe the patient after treatment. Recently, soluble human leukocyte antigen-G (sHLA-G) has been introduced as a new tumor marker for different cancer types, including colorectal, breast, lung, and ovary. The present descriptive-experimental study was carried out including patients with malignant prostate tumor, patients with benign prostate tumor, and a group of health men as the control group, as judged by an oncologist as well as a pathologist. After sterile blood sampling, sHLA-G was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in each group. The data was then analyzed using one-way ANOVA. P?0.05 was considered as statistically significant. The results showed that the mean of sHLA-G level was high in patients. Also, it was found that there was a significant difference in sHLA serum level between the three groups. The data revealed that sHLA-G can be a novel supplementary tumor marker in addition to PSA to diagnose prostate cancer. ? 2017.

This study assessed the awareness, knowledge and practice of lipid management among primary care physicians undergoing postgraduate training in Malaysia. Design: Cross sectional study. Setting: Postgraduate primary care trainees in Malaysia. Participants: 759 postgraduate primary care trainees were approached through email or hard copy, of whom 466 responded. Method: A self-Administered questionnaire was used to assess their awareness, knowledge and practice of dyslipidaemia management. The total cumulative score derived from the knowledge section was categorised into good or poor knowledge based on the median score, where a score of less than the median score was categorised as poor and a score equal to or more than the median score was categorised as good. We further examined the association between knowledge score and sociodemographic data. Associations were considered significant when p<0.05. Results: The response rate achieved was 61.4%. The majority (98.1%) were aware of the national lipid guideline, and 95.6% reported that they used the lipid guideline in their practice. The median knowledge score was 7 out of 10; 70.2% of respondents scored 7 or more which was considered as good knowledge.

This study aims to describe the service needs of caregivers of children with disabilities in the state of Penang, Malaysia, and to determine the child and family characteristics predisposing to having more caregiver needs. A cross-sectional survey was conducted between February and June 2013 among caregivers of children aged 0–12?years with disabilities registered with the Penang Department of Social Welfare. Caregivers completed a self-administered mailed questionnaire containing a 20-item Caregiver Needs Scale (CNS). Each item in the CNS was rated on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from ‘help not at all needed’ to ‘help extremely needed’. A total of 273 surveys were available for analysis (response rate 34.0%). The CNS contained four domains. The ‘Help getting Information and Services for child’ domain had the highest mean score (3.61, 95% CI: 3.46, 3.77) followed by ‘Help with Finances’ (3.29, 95% CI: 3.13, 3.45) and ‘Help Coping with child’ (3.11, 95% CI: 2.97, 3.25), while the ‘Help getting Childcare’ domain had the lowest mean score (2.30, 95% CI: 2.13, 2.47). Multivariate regression analysis identified caregivers of younger children and with more severe disability as having more caregiver needs in all domains. Besides that, caregivers of children with learning disability needed more help getting information and help with coping. Caregivers of children with learning and multiple disabilities needed more help getting childcare compared to children with other disability. Caregivers of Indian ethnicity, who had less than a tertiary education and who themselves had medical problems needed more help with finances.

Approximately 10-20% of the genetic testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 leads to the identification of variants of uncertain significance (VUS), with higher proportions in Asians. We investigated the functional significance of 7 BRCA1 and 25 BRCA2 variants in a multi-ethnic Asian cohort using a case-control approach. Methods: The MassARRAY genotyping was conducted in 1,394 Chinese, 406 Malay and 310 Indian breast cancer cases and 1,071 Chinese, 167 Malay and 255 Indian healthy controls. The association of individual variant with breast cancer risk was analyzed using logistic regression model adjusted for ethnicity, age and family history. Results: Our study confirmed BRCA2 p.Ile3412Val is presented in >2% of unaffected women and is likely benign, and BRCA2 p.Ala1996Thr which is predicted to be likely pathogenic by in-silico models is presented in 2% of healthy Indian women suggesting that it may not be associated with breast cancer risk.

Conclusions: Our study shows that BRCA2 p.Ile3412Val and p.Ala1996Thr are likely benign and highlights the need for population-specific studies to determine the likely functional significance of population-specific variants. Our study also suggests that BRCA1 p.Arg762Ser may be associated with increased risk of breast cancer but other methods or larger studies are required to determine a more precise estimate of breast cancer risk. ? 2017 The Author(s).",Asia; BRCA1; BRCA2; Malaysia; Variant of uncertain significance,"alanine; arginine; isoleucine; serine; threonine; valine; BRCA1 protein; BRCA1 protein, human; BRCA2 protein; BRCA2 protein, human; adult; age; Article; Asian; breast carcinoma; cancer risk; carcinogenicity; Chinese; cohort analysis; computer model; controlled study; ethnicity; family history; female; gene function; genetic association; genetic risk; genetic variability; genotype; human; human tissue; Indian; major clinical study; Malay (people); Malaysian; middle aged; population based case control study; population genetics; population research; prediction; risk assessment; tumor suppressor gene; amino acid substitution; breast tumor; case control study; DNA microarray; ethnic group; ethnology; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; Malaysia; male; Amino Acid Substitution; BRCA1 Protein; BRCA2 Protein; Breast Neoplasms; Case-Control Studies; Ethnic Groups; Female; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Malaysia; Male; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis",2-s2.0-85013387773

However, the effect of ACA on autophagy remains ambiguous. The aims of this study were to investigate the autophagy-inducing ability of ACA in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and to determine its role as pro-survival or pro-death mechanism. Cell viability assay was conducted using MTT. The effect of autophagy was assessed by acridine orange staining, GFP-LC3 punctate formation assay, and protein level were analysed using western blot. Annexin V-FITC/PI staining was performed to detect percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis by using flow cytometry. ACA inhibits the cell viability and induced formation of cytoplasmic vacuoles in NSCLC cells. Acidic vesicular organelles and GFP-LC3 punctate formation were increased in response to ACA exposure in A549 and SK-LU-1 cell lines; implying occurrence of autophagy. In western blot, accumulation of LC3-II accompanied by degradation of p62 was observed, which further confirmed the full flux of autophagy induction by ACA. The reduction of Beclin-1 upon ACA treatment indicated the Beclin-1-independent autophagy pathway. An early autophagy inhibitor, 3-methyaldenine (3-MA), failed to suppress the autophagy triggered by ACA; validating the existence of Beclin-1-independent autophagy. Silencing of LC3-II using short interfering RNA (siRNA) abolished the autophagy effects, enhancing the cytotoxicity of ACA through apoptosis. This proposed ACA triggered a pro-survival autophagy in NSCLC cells. Consistently, co-treatment with lysosomal inhibitor, chloroquine (CQ), exerted a synergistic effect resulting in apoptosis. Our findings suggested ACA induced pro-survival autophagy through Beclin-1-independent pathway in NSCLC. Hence, targeting autophagy pathway using autophagy inhibitor such as CQ represented a novel promising approach to potentiate the cytotoxicity of ACA through apoptosis in NSCLC. ? 2017, Public Library of Science.

Confocal microscopy of actin and tubulin redistribution was also performed. Results The quantitative RT-PCR result showed reduction of the DENV2 gene copies as the ligand concentration was increased. The confocal microscopy result showed increase?in the tubulin intensity (79.6%) of infected BHK21 cells treated with the ligand, compared with the non-treated cells (54.8%). The 1.5-fold increase in the intensity of tubulin suggested that the ligand inhibitory effect stabilized the cellular microtubule structure.

This review evaluates current evidence on the efficacy and safety of natural and fermented cordyceps preparations in patients with kidney transplant. Methods English and Chinese electronic databases including The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure) were searched up to December 2015 for relevant randomized controlled trials. Journals and conference proceedings were also searched. Two review authors independently selected trials for inclusion, extracted data, and assessed methodological quality. The primary outcome measures were incidence of acute graft rejection in the first year post-transplantation, one-year graft survival rate (defined as the percentage of patients with functioning grafts) and patient survival rate (or all-cause mortality). Results Nine studies were eligible for inclusion. These studies were considered to be at moderate risk of bias due to poor reporting of methods. Four studies that compared cordyceps-based therapy with azathioprine-based therapy gave comparable acute rejection rates, and graft and patient survival. The cordyceps-treated group however showed better kidney function and lower incidences of hyperuricemia, hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia and liver injury. Cordyceps used with different combinations of immunosuppressant therapy showed significant reduction in proteinuria after 6–12 months. Compared to the group receiving cyclosporine A monotherapy, treatment with a combination of cordyceps and cyclosporine A showed less treatment-induced nephrotoxicity. Adverse events were either not monitored or poorly documented in most trials. Conclusions Current evidence shows that cordyceps as an adjuvant to routine immunosuppressant therapy may benefit kidney transplant patient, however, better quality evidence is still required. ? 2016",Bailing; Cordyceps sinensis; Dong chong xia cao; Graft survival; Kidney transplantation; Meta-analysis,"azathioprine; cyclosporin A; immunosuppressive agent; acute graft rejection; Chinese medicine; drug efficacy; drug safety; graft survival; human; hyperglycemia; hyperuricemia; incidence; kidney function; kidney transplantation; meta analysis; monotherapy; mortality; nephrotoxicity; Ophiocordyceps; outcome assessment; proteinuria; randomized controlled trial (topic); Review; systematic review; adult; adverse effects; chemistry; Cordyceps; graft rejection; kidney transplantation; middle aged; procedures; Adult; Cordyceps; Graft Rejection; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Kidney Transplantation; Medicine, Chinese Traditional; Middle Aged",2-s2.0-85007106699

This study aimed to determine the ethnic variation in the prevalence of genetic (idiopathic) generalized epilepsy (GGE) and GGE with family history in a multi-ethnic Asian population in Malaysia. Method In this cross-sectional study, 392 patients with a clinical diagnosis of GGE were recruited in the neurology outpatient clinic, University of Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), from January 2011 till April 2016. Results In our epilepsy cohort (n = 2100), 18.7% were diagnosed to have GGE. Of those, 28.6% >(N = 112) had family history of epilepsy with a mean age of seizure onset of 16.5 years old, and 42.0% had myoclonic seizures (N = 47). The lifetime prevalence of epilepsy among first-degree relative of those with GGE and positive family history was 15.0%. Analysis according to ethnicity showed that Malaysian Chinese had the lowest percentage of GGE among those with epilepsy (12.3%), as compared with Indian and Malay (25.3% and 21.3%, p < 0.001). In addition, 32.1% of these Indian patients with GGE had positive family history, which is more than the Malay (26.4%) and Chinese (27.5%) ethnic groups. Consanguineous marriage was noted in 5 Indian families with positive family history (9.6%). Conclusion There was ethnic variation in the prevalence of GGE, whereby the Malaysian Chinese had the lowest percentage of GGE as compared with Indian and Malay.

The bed-exit alarm has only previously been evaluated in a handful of studies with mixed results. Therefore, we evaluated the effectiveness of a modular bed absence sensor device (M-BAS) in detecting bed exits among older inpatients in a middle income nation in East Asia. Methods: Patients aged ?65 years on an acute geriatric ward who were able to mobilize with or without walking aids and physical assistance were recruited to the study. The total number of alarms and the numbers of true and false alarms were recorded by ward nurses. The M-BAS device is placed across the mattress of all consenting participants. Nurses' workload was assessed using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Task Load Index (NASA-TLX) score, while nurses' perceptions were surveyed. Results: The sensitivity of the M-BAS was 100% with a positive predictive value of 68% and a nuisance alarm rate of 31%. There was a significant reduction in total NASA-TLX workload score (mean difference = 14.34 ± 13.96 SD, p < 0.001) at the end of the intervention period. 83% of the nurses found the device useful for falls prevention, 97% found it user friendly, and 87% would use it in future. Conclusion: The M-BAS was able to accurately detect bed absence episodes among geriatric inpatients and alert nurses accordingly. The use of the device significantly reduced the total workload score, while the acceptability of the device was high among our nurses. A larger, cluster randomized study to measure actual falls outcome associated with the use of the device is now indicated. ? 2017 Subermaniam, Welfred, Subramanian, Chinna, Ibrahim, Mohktar and Tan.",Accidental fall; Aged; Clinical alarm; Nurses; Preventive measure,,2-s2.0-85015270254

Malaysia, an upper middle-income country, has a well-established primary care system but one that favors rural populations and provision of services for maternal and child health and infectious diseases. Demographic factors including rapid aging, urbanization, as well as lifestyle changes characteristic of a modernizing society have led to an increase in noncommunicable diseases, including hypertension. In this article, we used data from a nationally representative household health survey to develop service coverage indicators for hypertension screening and treatment services. The age-standardized prevalence of hypertension was estimated to be 33.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 33.9, 33.9). Only 39.0% (95% CI, 37.5, 40.6) of adults with hypertension had been diagnosed by a medical practitioner, 35.7% had been on treatment, and 9.6% had blood pressure controlled under treatment. The diagnosis, treatment, and controlled treatment coverage were higher for older persons compared to younger persons. There were no differences in the diagnosis and treatment coverage between urban and rural areas and between ethnic groups. However, controlled treatment coverage was higher among Chinese and those living in urban areas. Our findings suggest that primary care services in Malaysia may need to intensify health education activities to promote screening services. There is also a need to reprioritize activities to provide regular community health screening of adults and increase access to affordable primary care services, especially in the urban areas. ? 2017 Chiu-Wan Ng, Mohd Ridzwan Shahari, Jeevitha Mariapun, Noran Naqiah Mohd Hairi, Sanjay Rampal, and Ajay Mahal.",Hypertension; Malaysia; Noncommunicable diseases; Primary care services; Universal health coverage,,2-s2.0-85063099974

We aim to identify the role of ethnicity and gender in relation to the occurrence of ACS among multiethnic Asians in Malaysia. Methods: The NCVD-ACS involves more than 15 Ministry of Health hospitals nationwide, universities and the National Heart Institute and enrolls patients presenting with ACS [ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and unstable angina (UA)]. We analyzed ethnic and gender differences across socio-demographic characteristics, hospital medications and invasive therapeutic procedures, and treatment of 13574 ACS patients from 2006 to 2010. Data were collected on demographic characteristics, risk factors, anthropometrics, treatments and procedures. Results: The distribution of the NCVD-ACS population was as follows: 49.0% Malays, 22.5% Chinese, 23.1% Indians and 5.3% others (representing other indigenous groups and non-Malaysian nationals). The mean age of ACS patients at presentation was 59.1 (SD + 12.0) years. More than 70% were men. A higher proportion of patients within each ethnic group had more than two coronary risk factors. Malay men had the highest proportion of smokers. Indian women had higher body mass index (BMI) and highest rate of diabetes mellitus. Indian men had highest waist circumference and family history of premature CAD. Chinese women had lowest BMI but highest rate of hypertension and hyperlipidemia. Overall, more men than women had STEMI than NSTEMI or UA among all ethnic groups. Although the use of standard pharmacotherapies (such as aspirin, beta-blocker and statin) generally mirrors guidelines and Western registries, optimal in-hospital invasive therapeutic procedures such as elective and emergency percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft rates was relatively lower than those reported in developed countries among all ethnic groups and genders. In STEMI, fibrinolysis (streptokinase) appeared to be the dominant treatment option (>70%) for all ethnic groups and genders. Women were older and more likely to have diabetes, hypertension, renal failure, and peripheral vascular disease than men across ethnicity. Women of all ethnicities were less likely to receive aspirin, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, and they were less likely to undergo angiography and PCI. Interestingly, majority (>50%) of patients had more than two diseased vessels suggesting a more severe disease pattern among the present cohort, and left anterior descending artery was found to be the commonest culprit artery involved in ACS, regardless of ethnicity and gender. Conclusions: Our data highlight the importance of diversity in gender-and ethnic-specific research in ACS, and establishes a critical understanding of the disease spectrum, demographics, risk factors andmanagement of ACS patients in Malaysia. The risk factor profiles, ACS stratum, medical treatment and invasive management were significantly different across ethnicity and gender. We have identified the existing gaps in clinical care that needs to be addressed and existing data strongly suggest that there is much potential for improvement in the management of ACS. ? 2017 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

It is believed in Feng Shui that architecture has a direct influence on the physical and psychological health of the users due to its effect on the energy field surrounding the body. Feng Shui, which literally translates to ""windwater,"" is the intuitive ancient art of understanding the energy of elements and directions. Although the existence of this energy field is scientifically proven, it is not widely discussed in the field of architecture. Therefore, the application and effectiveness of Feng Shui guidelines remains debatable. A study was conducted to validates the guidelines relating to the auspiciousness of the four main directions of Feng Shui where the size of the energy field surrounding the body was measured using AcuGraph and Pranic Scanning.

They are derived from natural sources and are mostly biodegradable; some are water soluble and not hazardous to the environment. Biopolymers are mostly produced by biological systems such as plants, animals, 230fungi, and microorganisms (Peralta et al. 2012), and are involved in plants, animals, and marines as natural building materials for their replication, transmission of foods, and energy transformation. Polymers are presented in various forms, such as fibers, papers, cloths, elastomers, plastics, enzymes, DNA, and major ingredients in soil and organisms (Carraher 2000). Biopolymers degrade by action of naturally occurring microorganisms, which has been dragging attention in recent years according to their role in various industrial and medical fields. They may be generated from microbial synthesized biopolymers, renewable resources, or petroleum-based chemicals (Khalil et al. 2013). A biopolymer is supposed to have specific properties, such as biocompatibility and biodegradable properties that enable them to be used in medicinal and other industrial usages. Biopolymers have various functions and characteristics due to their source they are originated from, and their chemical structure varies with extraction method, age, and type of algae (or) plants originated from the earth.

The contrast-enhanced T1-weighted image (cT1WI) as well as DWIs and ADC maps of different b-values (i.e. 200, 600 and 800 s/mm?) were obtained from nine fibroid and five adenomyoma patients, immediately after, and 12 months after MRgFUS treatment. The image contrast score, non-perfused volume (NPV) and NPV ratio obtained were compared to determine the feasibility of DWI and ADC mapping for MRgFUS treatment outcome evaluation. Our finding showed that immediately after MRgFUS treatment, the DWI acquired using 200 s/mm? b-value gave the highest image contrast score among all other b-values. The NPV calculated from DWI of 200 s/ mm? showed the best correlation (R? = 0.938) with post-contrast NPV. At 12 months follow-up, there was no specific b-value considered as significantly superior to others in terms of image contrast. However, the NPVs and NPV ratios obtained from all DWIs and ADC maps of different b-values were in good agreement with the post-contrast NPV and NPV ratio. We observed that the DWI, particularly obtained with a low b-value (i.e. 200 s/mm?), is feasible for delineation and quantitative volumetric evaluation of the ablated region immediately after the MRgFUS treatment.

Our results demonstrated that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with ethyl acetate (EA) extract greatly decreased intracellular and secreted total triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) compared with other extracts. Further investigation of cellular expression of selected apolipoproteins also revealed that oleate-induced HepG2 cells treated with the EA extract best attenuated the apolipoprotein (Apo) profile by downregulating ApoB-100 and ApoE while upregulating ApoA1. Because both ApoB-100 and ApoE are key components of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very LDL (VLDL), which are recognized as “bad cholesterol,” this result indicates that treatment with the EA extract inhibited LDL and VLDL production in oleate-induced HepG2 cells. On the other hand, increasing ApoA1 evidence shows antiatherogenic benefits to increasing ApoA1, the key component of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), particularly in relation to its role in promoting reverse cholesterol transport and preventing LDL oxidation; this indicates that the EA extract upregulated the production of HDL (“good cholesterol”).

Contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was carried out post-procedure to assess and quantify the area of ablation. Those with malignant primary tumors had the tumors resected 2 weeks after the treatment and the ablated areas were examined histopathologically (HPE). The other patients were followed up for 3 months to assess for the side effects and pain scores. Results: Significant volume of ablation was noted on CE MRI after the treatment. Benign bone tumors were ablated with minimal adverse effects. Metastatic bone disease was successfully treated with significant decrease in pain scores. Ablated primary malignant tumors showed significant coagulative necrosis on MRI and the HPE showed 100% necrosis. Pain scores significantly decreased 3 months after the procedure. Only two patients had superficial skin blistering and three patients had increase in pain scores immediately after treatment. Conclusion: MRgFUS is effective, safe, and noninvasive procedure that can be an adjunct in the management of primary and metastatic bone tumors. ?

One of them is related to the controversial risk of developing cancer due to the use of antidepressants. In the current narrative review, we conducted a literature search in PubMed using the relevant search terms to identify studies or reports on the association of cancer with the use of antidepressants. We identified eleven published studies including one meta-analysis, one editorial review and one animal study in our search. The results showed that there was lack of evidence showing the increased risk of cancer with the use of antidepressants. In contrast, there were reports on the anticancer properties of antidepressants. In conclusion, based on current literature findings, the use of antidepressants do not seem to lead to increased risk of cancer. However, further large longitudinal studies are needed to examine the relationship between the usage of antidepressants and the risk of cancer. ? 2017 Slovansky Ustav AV CR.

This qualitative study aimed at exploring the post-treatment impact and needs of prostate cancer survivors. Method: A qualitative study design was used. One in-depth interview and four focus group discussions were conducted with 24 prostate cancer survivors (age range: 58–79 years) from government and private hospitals in Malaysia in 2013. Trained researchers used a topic guide to guide the interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, checked and managed with Nvivo 10 software. A thematic approach was used to analyse the data. Result: Three main themes emerged from the analysis: (a) impact of prostate cancer on the survivors, (b) support needed for coping and (c) information needs. Prostate cancer has an important impact on the survivors’ lifestyle after treatment. Some of them have to live with the post-treatment side effects. They were anxious about the possibility of relapse. In addition to family and peer support, there were participants who felt that spiritual support was important in helping them cope with the possibility of relapse. The survivors felt that they did not receive enough information about post-treatment care, dietary measures and supplements for relapse prevention, treatment and prognosis. Conclusion: Prostate cancer has a significant impact on the survivor’s lifestyle, emotional and physical health. They need information and emotional support from the healthcare professionals, family and peers. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to explore the needs of prostate cancer survivors and provide the necessary support. ? 2017, Academy of Family Physicians of Malaysia.

Broadly speaking, they can be defined as compounds derived from cinnamic acid. They are present at high concentrations in many food products, including fruits, vegetables, tea, cocoa, and wine. Cinnamic acid has received great attention in oriental research where it has been used as an antioxidant in food additives in Asia and especially in medical studies in China after being proven to be an effective component of medicinal herbs used by traditional medicine. Cinnamic acid is a phenolic acid widely distributed in the plant kingdom. It presents a wide range of potential therapeutic effects useful in the treatments of cancer, diabetes, lung, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as hepatic, neuro-, and photoprotective effects and antimicrobial and antiinflammatory activities. Overall, the pharmaceutical potential of cinnamic acid can be attributed to its ability to scavenge free radicals. However, recent studies have revealed that cinnamic acid presents pharmacological properties beyond those related to its antioxidant activity, such as the ability to competitively inhibit HMG-CoA reductase and activate glucokinase, contributing to reduce hypercholesterolemia and hyperglycemia, respectively. A diet rich in hydroxycinnamic acids is thought to be associated with beneficial health effects such as a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. The impact of hydroxycinnamic acids on health depends on their intake and pharmacokinetic properties. It can be found free, dimerized or esterified with proteins and polysaccharides in the cell wall, such as arabinoxylans in grasses and xyloglucans in bamboo. Cinnamic acid is an important biological and structural component of the plant cell wall. Due to its ability to stop radical chain reactions by resonance followed by polymerization, cinnamic acid offers protection against UV radiation and is responsible for cross-linking polysaccharides and other cell wall polymers. Cinnamic acid can be absorbed by the small intestine and excreted in the urine, where therapeutic efficacy is dependent on its physiological concentrations and pharmacokinetic properties, which include absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion of metabolites. Mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, especially 2D NMR (COSY, NOESY, HMQC, and HMBC), are the most useful analytical techniques for the structural elucidation of hydroxycinnamic acids besides UV, IR, CD, X-ray analysis, and chemical degradation. In this chapter, we update the reader about the therapeutic properties of cinnamic acid, reviewing its dietary sources, the pharmacokinetic profile, antioxidant action mechanisms, and therapeutic effects in the treatment and prevention of various diseases, in order to provide a basis for understanding its pharmaceutical potential. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Bioavailability; Biological activity; Biosynthesis; Functional foods; Hydroxycinnamic acids; Prophetic medicine; Synthesis,,2-s2.0-85040702812

Methods: Patients were assessed for anthropometry measurements, 24-h diet recall and nutritional status using Scored Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) questionnaire while the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Care Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) was used to assess QOL two weeks prior to the initiation of pelvic radiotherapy. Results: Mean Body Mass Index (BMI) of patients was 23.3+3.3kg/m2 and 33% of patients experienced weight loss prior to pelvic radiotherapy. The PG-SGA rating indicated that 63% of patients were at Stage A (well-nourished) and 37% were in Stage B (moderate malnutrition). The PG-SGA numerical score was a significant predictor of QOL, after adjusting for socio-demographic factors (R2=0.861, p &lt; 0.05).

However, around 57.0% of the respondents believe that abdominal pain is not a symptom of dengue fever and 32% convinced that blood transfusion can transmit dengue. No significant correlation was found between attitude and practice score to socio-demographic characters. However, a good practice towards dengue fever is associated with good knowledge (65.4 %) nevertheless it did not influence their attitude. Moreover, the attitude seems to be poor regardless of knowledge level (44.0%). Therefore, more prevention practices to raise the awareness of population toward dengue fever such as health campaigns and health education in school level should be initiated.

However, related studies are lacking in Asia.We aim to determine the safety of C1LM screw for the Chinese, Indians, and Malays. Methods: Three-dimensional computed tomographies of 180 subjects (60 from each ethnic) were analyzed. The length and angulations of CILM screw and the location of internal carotid artery (ICA) in relation to C1LM were assessed and classified according to the classification by Murakami et al. The incidence of ponticulus posticus (PP) was determined and the differences among the population of these three ethnics were recorded. Results: The average base length was 8.5+1.4 mm. The lengths within the lateral mass were between 14.7 ± 1.6 mm and 21.7 ± 2.3 mm. The prevalence of PP was 8.3%. 55.3% (199) of ICA were located in zone 0, 38.3% (138) in zone 1-1, 6.4% (23) in zone 1-2, and none in zone 1-3 and zone 2. The average angulation from the entry point to the ICA was 8.5° +6.4° laterally. The mean distance of ICA from C1 anterior cortex was 3.7+1.7 mm (range: 0.6 ~ 11.3). There was no difference in distribution of ICA in zone 1 among the three population (Chinese-47%, Indians-61%, and Malays-53%; p > 0.05). Conclusions: No ICA is located medial to the entry point of C1LM screw. If bicortical purchase of CILM screw is needed, screw protrusion of less than 3 mm or medially angulated is safe for ICA. The incidence of PP is 8.3% with higher prevalence among the Indian population. ?

Strong elements that are related to the ELM agents are assembled to form the trust management in which will be letting the CBS method to improve the performance in MAS. The efficacy of the ELM-MAS-CBS model is verified with several activation functions using benchmark datasets (i.e., Pima Indians Diabetes, Iris andWine) and real world applications (i.e., circulating water systems and governor). The results show that the proposed ELM-MAS-CBS model is able to achieve better accuracy as compared with other approaches. ? 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.",Certified belief in strength; Extreme learning machine; Multi-Agent System; Neural network; Pattern classification; Power generation,Benchmarking; Electric circuit breakers; Knowledge acquisition; Learning systems; Neural networks; Pattern recognition; Power generation; Activation functions; Benchmark datasets; Certified belief in strength; Circulating water system; Extreme learning machine; ITS applications; Trust management; Trust measurement; Multi agent systems,2-s2.0-85032802156

Background: Despite advocacy being a crucial role for nurses, its scope is often limited in clinical practice. Although numerous studies have identifed barriers to patient advocacy, their recommendations for resolution were unclear. Method: The study employed a constructivist grounded theory methodology, with 13 Saudi Arabian registered nurses, working in critical care, in a tertiary academic teaching hospital. Semi-structured interviews, with broad open-ended questions, and re?ective participant journals were used to collect data. All interviews were concurrently analysed and transcribed verbatim. Results: Gender, culture, education, subjugation, communal patronage, organisational support and repercussions, and role-associated risks were all revealed as factors affecting their ability to act as advocates for critically ill patients. Conclusion: Saudi Arabian ICU nurses in the study believed that advocacy is problematic. Despite attempting to advocate for their patients, they are unable to act to an optimal level, instead choosing avoidance of the potential risks associated with the role, or confrontation, which often had undesirable outcomes. Patient advocacy from a Saudi Arabian nursing perspective is contextually complex, controversial and remains uncertain. Further research is needed to ensure patient safety is supported by nurses as effective advocates. ? 2017 MA Healthcare Ltd.",Critical care; Intensive care units; Organisational culture; Patient advocacy; Patient safety; Saudi Arabia,adult; avoidance behavior; clinical practice; critically ill patient; education; female; gender; genetic transcription; grounded theory; human; intensive care unit; male; organization; patient advocacy; patient safety; perception; registered nurse; Saudi Arabia; semi structured interview; teaching hospital,2-s2.0-85030033303

Thus, therapeutic alternatives from nature should be explored to lessen this burden. This is vital owing to the common occurrences of resistance in conventional therapies alongside their alarming side effects. Aims This study was carried out to investigate the inhibitory effect of Artonin E in female mice bearing 4T1 mammary tumour. Methods 4T1 cells in 100?L PBS were injected into the right mammary fat pad of each female Balb/c mice aged between six to eight weeks. Treatment was commenced when the palpable tumour attained a size of 50–200mm3. The treatment groups included Artonin E, at dosages of 25mg/kg, 50mg/kg and 100mg/kg per oral bi-weekly, 10mg/kg of paclitaxel weekly and 5 percent tween 20 biweekly. Tumour volume and body weight changes were recorded at the staging day and then twice every week throughout the study period. At the end of the study, the vital tissues were collected for histopathologcal assessment and blood samples were taken for serum biochemical analyses. Results From the results, the group treated with either 50mg/kg or 100mg/kg of Artonin E showed a significant (p&lt;0.05) reduction in tumour volume. Artonin E delayed quadruple tumour growth by more than five days in comparison to the untreated control group. Histopathology and biochemical analysis revealed no toxicity in the dosages of artonin E used in this study. Secondary tumour, which had metastasized to distant organs were seen to reduce upon treatment with Artonin E. Conclusion With the capacity to reduce in vivo tumour growth, Artonin E has a great prospect to be developed into an anticancer agent. ? 2017, Australasian Medical Journal Pty Ltd.

The emergence of molecular technology has opened various possibilities for constructing tailor-made proteins, particularly protein E from bacteriophage PhiX174 for the production of bacterial ghosts (BGs) applied in vaccines purposes. In the present study, the plamdaPRcI-Elysis plasmid carrying the PhiX174 lysis gene E and thermo-sensitive lamda PR-cl857 regulatory system was constructed. Two Salmonella Enteritidis (SE-2 and SE- 4) and one Salmonella Typhimurium (ST-4) isolates were able to uptake the lysis plasmid via electrotransformation. Generation of ghosts was enhanced by increasing the incubation temperature up to 42°C. Cell viability of SE-2, SE-4 and ST-4 decreased ranging in log 2.7 to log 4.1 cycles after lysis induction. Moreover, SE-2 and SE-4 exhibited the earliest reduction of CFU after 3 h of incubation. Our results may provide a promising avenue for the development of Salmonella BGs vaccines. ?

Genomic medicine is implemented at a different pace not only due to limited resources but also because of the slow pace toward the adoption of new findings. The potential of genomic medicine to rationalize medical diagnosis and treatment has been poorly understood. In this chapter, we discuss examples from the successful implementation of genomic medicine in developing countries. We feel that these examples can serve as model cases toward the implementation of genomic medicine in resource-limited environments. ? 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Although major advances have been recorded in the diagnosis of infectious diseases in humans, parasitic diseases continue to present challenges, particularly in resource-poor countries, and this is mainly attributable to war and famine. Factors such as poverty, deteriorated health facilities and destruction of infrastructure are the consequence of the lack of suitable sanitary practices and proper hygiene, especially in refugee camps, that adversely promote infectious diseases to migrants, particularly among vulnerable children. Generally, the gastrointestinal tract is the predilection site for most helminths and protozoa. They are therefore regarded as a serious public-health problem, as they cause malabsorption, malnutrition and blood loss, leading to anaemia or even death. In addition to their health effects, parasitic infections cause physical and mental impairment in children, retard their educational achievements and hinder economic development. ?

Methods: The initial proposals were based on 5 main areas of PRM research: biosciences in rehabilitation, biomedical rehabilitation sciences and engineering, clinical PRM sciences, integrative rehabilitation sciences, and human functioning sciences. This list became a model for structuring the abstracts for the 9th and 10th World Congresses of PRM, held in Berlin, Germany (2015) and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia (2016), respectively. The next step was to evaluate the implementation of this model in both congresses. Results: It was found that the 5 main research areas were still used as the main principles (chapters) in which to organize the abstracts. However, some modifications have been made to cover topics that were not included in the initial proposal. Conclusion: A more comprehensive list of topics has been developed, not only for topic list announcements, but also for the structuring and classification of abstracts for future international, regional or national PRM congresses. ? 2017 Foundation of Rehabilitation Information.",Physical and rehabilitation Medicine; Research topics; Scientific field; World Congresses,"classification; Germany; human; Malaysia; organization; physical model; rehabilitation; rehabilitation medicine; clinical trial; history; multicenter study; organization; organization and management; rehabilitation medicine; Congresses as Topic; History, 21st Century; Humans; Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine",2-s2.0-85021048913

Design/methodology/approach - In this study, pigment from the pulp and peel of H. polyrhizus fruits was extracted using 80 per cent methanol and 80 per cent acetone. Effects of pH and light exposure during storage on betacyanin content were evaluated. The betacyanin extract, mixed with 20 per cent poly(methyl methacrylate) and coated onto glass slides, was tested with different concentrations of sodium hydroxide (NaCl) to determine its durability. An ultraviolet (UV)-visible spectrophotometer was used for analyzing the betacyanin content. Findings - Betacyanin pigment extracted from pulp using 80 per cent acetone as the solvent at pH 1.0 had the highest betacyanin content. Betacyanin content decreased when stored under exposure of light compared to storage in dark. In this study, increasing concentration of NaCl decreased the absorbance values at faster rates for betacyanin-coated glass slides. Research limitations/implications - Acetone is volatile and evaporates rapidly. Pigments extracted with acetone were stored in glass vials which were closed tightly to prevent evaporation. Social implications - The social implication is the use of natural pigments from cactus species as a valuable and eco-friendly source in a coating system without adverse effects for human health. Originality/value - The method for detection of stability and effectiveness of betacyanin pigment used as a natural colorant for coating application was beneficial and recent for environment-friendly and natural plant-based product development. ?

Important clinical manifestations include encephalitis in immunocompromised patients as well as miscarriage and fetal damage during early pregnancy. Toxoplasma gondii dense granule antigen 2 and 5 (GRA2 and GRA5) are essential for parasitophorous vacuole development of the parasite. To evaluate the potential of GRA2 and GRA5 as recombinant DNA vaccine candidates, these antigens were cloned into eukaryotic expression vector (pcDNA 3.1C) and evaluated in vaccination experiments. Recombinant DNA vaccines constructed with genes encoding GRAs were validated in Chinese hamster ovary cells before evaluation using lethal challenge of the virulent T. gondii RH strain in BALB/c mice. The DNA vaccines of pcGRA2 and pcGRA5 elicited cellular-mediated immune response with significantly higher levels of interferon-gamma, interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and IL-10 (P < 0.05) compared with controls. A mixed T-helper cell 1 (Th1)/Th2 response was associated with slightly prolonged survival. These findings provide evidence that DNA vaccination with GRA2 and GRA5 is associated with Th1-like cell-mediated immune responses.

The most promising drug candidate of this class would be Triapine (3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone) which has entered phase II clinical trials as a potent anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent. Objective: The current research aimed to synthesize several Schiff base ligands from (3-formyl-4-hydroxyphenyl) methyltriphenylphosphonium (T). Additionally, the current research aimed to study the growth inhibitory effect of triphenylphosphonium containing thiosemicarbazone derivatives on PC-3 cells by deciphering the mechanisms involved in cell death. Method: The compounds were characterized by various spectroscopic methods (infrared spectra, 1H NMR, 13C NMR, HRESIMS and X-ray crystallography) and the results were in conformity with the structure of the targeted compounds. Growth inhibitory effect of the compounds were performed against six human cell lines. Results: DM(tsc)T displayed most potent activity against PC-3 cells with IC50 value of 2.64± 0.33 μM, surpassing that of the positive control cisplatin (5.47± 0.06 μM). There were marked morphological changes observed in DM(tsc)T treated cells stained with acridine orange and ethidium bromide which were indicative of cell apoptosis. Treatment with DM(tsc)T showed that the cell cycle is arrested in the G0/G1 phase after 72 hours. Mitochondrial membrane potential loss was observed in cells treated with DM(tsc)T, indicating the apoptosis could be due to mitochondria mediated pathway. Conclusion: This study indicates that DM(tsc)T would serve as a lead scaffold for rational anticancer agent development. ? 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.",Annexin V/PI; Apoptosis; Cell cycle; Mitochondrial membrane potential; MTT; Schiff base; Thiosemicarbazone,"(3 formyl 4 hydroxyphenyl) methyltriphenyl phosphonium Chloride; 3 aminopicolinaldehyde thiosemicarbazone; 4 hydroxy 3 [(E) (methylcarbamothioylhydrazono); 5 (chloromethyl) 2 hydroxybenzaldehyde; ethidium bromide; lipocortin 5; thiosemicarbazone; thiosemicarbazone derivative; unclassified drug; [3 [(E) (carbamothioylhydrazono)methyl] 4 hydroxyphenyl]; [3 [(E) (carbamothioylhydrazono)methyl] 4 hydroxyphenyl] Methyltriphenylphosphonium Chloride; [3 [(e) (dimethylcarbamothioylhydrazono) methyl] 4 hydroxyphenyl] methyltriphenylphosphonium chloride; antineoplastic agent; thiosemicarbazone derivative; apoptosis; Article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; cell cycle; drug synthesis; electrospray mass spectrometry; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; growth inhibition; human; human cell; IC50; infrared radiation; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrial membrane potential; prostate cancer; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; tumor model; X ray crystallography; cell proliferation; chemical structure; chemistry; dose response; drug effects; drug screening; male; metabolism; mitochondrion; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell line; Antineoplastic Agents; Apoptosis; Cell Cycle; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Screening Assays, Antitumor; Humans; Male; Mitochondria; Molecular Structure; Structure-Activity Relationship; Thiosemicarbazones",2-s2.0-85020254034

AW is a derivative of an Arabic word that means excellent, moderate, just and professional. Design/methodology/approach: This paper explains the potential of AW concept for HS both in epistemological and ontological perspectives with a focus on CSP. It focuses on the AW value concept according to Ibn Miskawaih and its applicability in CSP in Malaysia. Using content analysis and “integration perspective” between AW and contemporary Malaysia CSP practice, several questions were unlocked in this paper. They include the following: what are AW values for HS? What is the standard of value for sustainable CSP in Malaysia? And how HS from AW perspective can generate quality CSP in Malaysia? Findings: It is found that AW can extend and enrich the meaning of value for HS and subsequently the civil service quality in Malaysia. Findings showed that AW can offer a holistic approach through four AW core values. The study also showed that AW is embedded indirectly in Malaysia CSP before it was highlighted under Najib Razak administration. This study suggests continuous emphasis on AW values in three service areas, namely, service requirements (SR), service priorities (SP) and service quality (SQ). Research limitations/implications: The limitation is to bring the value concept into the HS parameters. HS is indexed by quantitative indicators including economy, health and education achievements, rather than value concept. This study tries to expand the potential and importance of value as an indicator for HS. That is through a concept named as AW. Practical implications: AW values and approaches are perceived to be a potential focus system for HS and resource building in Malaysian civil service. Social implications: Extending the meaning of HS through the application of AW concept is perceived to enrich social values and development. Originality/value: This paper argues that current discussion on HS is not fit for all purposes because it lacks human great values. This paper subsequently argues AW concept as potential HS values, especially for CSP, in Malaysia. ? 2017, ?

Methods: A retrospective chart review study of breast cancer patients hospitalised between 2009 and 2014 at Penang Hospital, a public tertiary hospital in Malaysia was conducted. Patients with mild (total serum calcium = 10.5 - 11.9 mg/dl); moderate (12 - 12.9 mg/dl), and severe (?13 mg/dl) hypercalcaemia at cancer diagnosis or during cancer treatment were included. Relevant data were extracted from medical records analyzed statistically. Results: From the records, 1,023 breast cancer patients were identified, 164 of which had hypercalcaemia at cancer diagnosis or during cancer treatment. About 25% of the hypercalcaemic patients had advanced-stage cancer, while 20% had severe hypercalcaemia. Regarding the pattern of bisphosphonate use, the results showed that more than half of the patients received pamidronate as first-line treatment; about a quarter were treated with zoledronic acid, while others received only normal saline. These treatments produced significant reductions in serum calcium levels relative to baseline values. Conclusion: Although zoledronic acid is considered as the treatment of choice for hypercalcemia of malignancy, the current study found that the first line treatment used for hypercalcemia is pamidronate, mainly because its cost is lower than that of zoledronic acid. ?

DNA extraction kit. Genomic DNA was run on Agarose gel electrophoresis, checked the Genomic DNA quality and amplified using prion region specific primer pair.

Samples having required fragment size were selected and sent for sequencing through Sanger Sequencing. All the sequences were aligned through multiple sequence alignment and edited using Codon Code aligner and explored for phylogenetic analysis. A portion of 667 bp was finally selected for phylogenetic analysis of dromedary camels from Pakistan with 61 different mammalian species (drawn from GenBank) that revealed five different clades. We found 99.9% nucleotide sequence similarities among Dromedary camels (Germany), Dromedary camels (Iran), and Dromedary camels (Pakistan). We observed deletion in dromedary camels in codon region 66-69 except wild Bactrian camels that might be the causative factor for Prion protein gene resistance in camels. The Neighbor-Joining method with bootstrap analysis of 1000 replicates was used to draw phylogenetic tree. Discussion: This study documents the presence of 14 PrP polymorphisms and shows the relationship between different camel breeds. The deletion had not previously been examined PrP allelic variation, and was found to segregate in these breeds. However, additional data are necessary to demonstrate PrP and genetic approach will be ideal for the future studies and, more investigations are necessary to demonstrate PrP genetic resistance in camels. The utility of these techniques in identifying Prion genes and selecting superior animals and culling the weak animals and making them parents of the next generation that will lead to producing more meat and milk with fewer animals are well discussed and by slaughtering of high Prion incidence will eliminate human animal fatal neurodegenerative disorders.",Dromedary camels; Pakistan; Phylogenetic; Polymorphism; Prion protein gene,,2-s2.0-85018693807

Prescription records in the oncology and cardiology wards of University Malaya Medical Centre between 1st of January and 31st of December 2014 were obtained retrospectively from the pharmacy database. The main outcome was prescribing pattern, calculated as the total defined daily dose (DDD) for that group of drugs divided by the number of beds multiplied with 365 days. 11.8% (n=160) of patients in the oncology ward and 5.3% (n=168) of patients in the cardiology ward had prescription records of psychotropic drugs. The odds of patients prescribed with psychotropic drug in the oncology ward were significantly higher than patients in the cardiology ward (OR=2.37, 95%CI: 1.89-2.98).

The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of explicit information (EI) on motor-sequence learning in MS patients. Methods: Thirty patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), age: 29.5 (SD = 5.6) years and 30 healthy gender-, age-, and education-matched control group participants, age: 28.8 (SD = 6.0) years, were recruited for this study. The participants in the healthy group were then randomly assigned into an EI (n = 15) group and a no-EI (n = 15) group. Similarly, the participants in the control group were then randomly assigned into EI (n = 15) and no-EI (n = 15) groups. The participants performed a serial reaction time (SRT) task and reaction times. A retention test was performed after 48 hours. Results: All participants reduced their reaction times across acquisition (MS group: 46.4 (SD = 3.3) minutes, P &lt; 0.001, and healthy group: 39.4 (SD = 3.3) minutes, P &lt; 0.001). The findings for the within-participants effect of repeated measures of time were significant (F(5.06, 283.7) = 71.33. P &lt; 0.001). These results indicate that the interaction between group and time was significant (F(5.06, 283.7) = 6.44. P &lt; 0.001), which indicated that the reaction time in both groups was significantly changed between the MS and healthy groups across times (B1 to B10). The main effect of the group (MS and healthy) (F(1, 56) = 22.78. P &lt; 0.001) and also the main effect of no-EI vs EI (F(1, 56) = 4.71. P &lt; 0.001) were significant. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that that RRMS patients are capable of learning new skills, but the provision of EI prior to physical practice is deleterious to implicit learning. It is sufficient to educate MS patients on the aim and general content of the training and only to provide feedback at the end of the rehabilitative session. ?

The underlying pathophysiology is secondary to unequal aeration of the middle ear cleft with the surrounding atmosphere and it can be explained using Boyle's Law. We describe an unusual presentation of baro-otalgia in a pilot secondary to cholesteatoma obstructing the aditus despite normal middle ear pressure equalization provided by a grommet in the ear. CASE REPORT: A 26-yr-old pilot with a presenting complaint of conductive hearing loss was diagnosed and treated for congenital cholesteatoma. His hearing improved, but 4 yr later he developed ear pain during the cruising phase of flight at an altitude of 9144 m (30,000 ft) above sea level. This pain persisted until descent to 4876 m (16,000 ft). Despite insertion of a middle ear ventilating tube, he remained symptomatic, requiring further investigation. This led to the diagnosis of recurrent cholesteatoma obstructing the aditus to the mastoid cavity. Upon surgical removal of the cholesteatoma, symptoms resolved. DISCUSSION: We hypothesize that the recurrent cholesteatoma caused obstruction to normal aeration of the mastoid air cells during the changing atmospheric air pressure, thus producing pain. This is akin to sinus barotrauma instead of the usual pathophysiology underlying barotitis. ? by the Aerospace Medical Association, Alexandria, VA.",Baro-otitis; Congenital cholesteatoma; Sinus barotrauma,"adult; aerospace medicine; airplane pilot; altitude; barotrauma; case report; cholesteatoma; complication; diagnostic imaging; Earache; human; male; mastoid; pressure; recurrent disease; x-ray computed tomography; Adult; Aerospace Medicine; Altitude; Barotrauma; Cholesteatoma; Cholesteatoma, Middle Ear; Earache; Humans; Male; Mastoid; Pilots; Pressure; Recurrence; Tomography, X-Ray Computed",2-s2.0-85013743297

However, its use in minimally invasive spine surgery has been limited to anterior interbody fusion procedures. To date, no study has evaluated the feasibility of percutaneous posterolateral fusion in the spine utilizing recombinant bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2). Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of percutaneous posterolateral fusion in the spine utilizing rhBMP-2. Study Design: Animal study. Methods: This is an animal research model involving 32 New Zealand white rabbits stratified into 4 study groups: control, autogenous iliac crest bone graft (ICBG), demineralized bone matrix (DBM), and rhBMP-2 groups, with 8 study subjects per group. The rhBMP-2 group was subdivided into the open technique (right side) and the percutaneous technique groups (left side). Fusion was graded at 6 weeks and 3 months after plain radiography, computed tomography, and clinical assessment with the following grading system: grade A, no bone formation; grade B, non-bridging bone formation; grade C, fusion; and grade D, fusion with ectopic bone formation. Results: No fusion was noted in the placebo and the DBM groups. However, in the DBM group, bone formation occurred in 37.5% of the subjects. The rhBMP-2 group had a higher fusion rate compared with the ICBG group at 6 weeks and 3 months. The fusion rate for the ICBG, the rhBMP-2 (open), and the rhBMP-2 (percutaneous) groups were 37.5%, 87.5%, and 50.0% at 6 weeks and 50.0%, 100.0%, and 62.5% at 3 months, respectively. Ectopic bone formation occurred in 12.5% of the cases in the rhBMP-2 (percutaneous) group and in 25.0% of the cases in the rhBMP-2 (open) group. Conclusions: Usage of rhBMP-2 is feasible for percutaneous posterolateral fusion of the lumbar spine in this animal model. However, a more precise delivery system might improve the fusion rate when the percutaneous technique is used. A significant rate of ectopic bone formation occurred when rhBMP-2 was used.

In this study, we developed a non-recombinant L. lactis surface displaying the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 hemagglutinin (HA1). Three recombinant proteins, HA1/L/AcmA, HA1/AcmA, and HA1 were overexpressed in Escherichia coli, and purified. In the binding study using flow cytometry, the HA1/L/AcmA, which contained the single-chain variable fragment (scFv) peptide linker showed significantly higher percentage of binding counts and mean fluorescence binding intensity (MFI) (51.7 ± 1.4% and 3,594.0 ± 675.9, respectively) in comparison to the HA1/AcmA without the scFv peptide linker (41.1 ± 1.5% and 1,652.0 ± 34.1, respectively). Higher amount of HA1/L/AcmA (?2.9 × 104 molecules per cell) was displayed on L. lactis when compared to HA1/AcmA (?1.1 × 104 molecules per cell) in the immunoblotting analysis. The HA1/L/AcmA completely agglutinated RBCs at comparable amount of protein to that of HA1/AcmA and HA1. Computational modeling of protein structures suggested that scFv peptide linker in HA1/L/AcmA kept the HA1 and the AcmA domain separated at a much longer distance in comparison to HA1/AcmA. These findings suggest that insertion of the scFv peptide linker between HA1 and AcmA improved binding of recombinant proteins to L. lactis. Hence, insertion of scFv peptide linker can be further investigated as a potential approach for improvement of heterologous proteins displayed on the surface of L. lactis using the AcmA binding domain. ? 2016 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

In 2014 we used a questionnaire to evaluate the extent of awareness of basic mosquito biology and mosquito-borne diseases in 6 villages, Kampung Masjid, Kampung Teluk Gedung, Kampung Teluk Dalam, Kampung Ujung Kelawai, Kampung Sungai Pinang Besar, and Kampung Sungai Pinang Kechil on Pangkor Island, Malaysia.

Dengue hemorrhagic fever is characterized by vascular permeability, coagulation-disorders and thrombocytopenia, which can culminate in hypotension i.e. dengue shock syndrome. Hypopituitarism arising as a complication of dengue is extremely rare. Hemorrhagic pituitary apoplexy of pre-existing pituitary adenomas has been rarely reported in dengue. We describe an uncommon case of hypopituitarism in a dengue shock syndrome survivor without known pituitary adenoma. A 49 years old nulliparous lady (from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia) presented with typical symptoms of hypocortisolism. Postural hypotension was evident with normal secondary sexual characteristics. Further history revealed that she survived an episode of dengue shock syndrome 6 years ago where premature menopause developed immediately after discharge, and subsequently insidious onset of multiple hormonal deficiencies indicative of panhypopituitarism. There were no neuro-ophthalmological symptoms suggestive of pituitary apoplexy during hospitalization for severe dengue. Magnetic resonance imaging of the pituitary 6 years later revealed an empty sella. Autoimmune screen and anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies were negative. We describe a rare possible causative association of severe dengue with panhypopituitarism without known pituitary adenoma, postulating pituitary infarction secondary to hypotension (mimicking Sheehan's syndrome), or a direct viral cytopathic effect. Subclinical pituitary apoplexy secondary to asymptomatic pituitary hemorrhage however cannot be excluded.

Numerous factors have been attributed to the severity of dengue infection, including host genome variation. Genomic structural variations such as copy number variation (CNVs), constitutes a substantial fraction of the human genetic variability, but its role in susceptibility to infectious diseases is not well understood. Previous studies have confirmed the role of host candidate gene CD209 variation in the susceptibility to dengue. Although the CNV of this gene has been reported in the Database of Genomic Variants (DGV), its characterization has yet to be studied. Therefore we aimed to characterize the CNV of the candidate gene CD209 among dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever patients from Malaysia. We found that 19% of the dengue patients had copy number loss (copy number?<?2), while 36% had copy number gain (copy number?>?2). Analysis of genetic association between the gene copy number and vascular leakage in dengue revealed no statistical significance (P?=?0.9043), suggesting minimal contribution of CD209 CNV in the aetiology of dengue hemorrhagic fever. Further investigation with higher number of samples, however, is needed to confirm this finding. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V.",CD209; Copy number variation; Dengue fever; Dengue hemorrhagic fever; qPCR,CD209 antigen; transcription factor FOXP2; adolescent; adult; Article; cell adhesion; child; controlled study; copy number variation; dengue; dengue hemorrhagic fever; disease severity; female; gene deletion; gene identification; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic variability; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; middle aged; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; school child; young adult,2-s2.0-84992215125

Methods: All 5616 patients, diagnosed with breast cancer in University Malaya Medical Centre from 1999 to 2013 were included. In 945 elderly patients (aged 65?years and above), multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify factors associated with treatment, following adjustment for age, ethnicity, tumor, and other treatment characteristics. The impact of lack of treatment on survival of the elderly was assessed while accounting for comorbidities. Results: One in five elderly patients had comorbidities. Compared to younger patients, the elderly had more favorable tumor characteristics, and received less loco-regional treatment and chemotherapy. Within stage I–IIIa elderly breast cancer patients, 10?% did not receive any surgery. These patients were older, more likely to be Malays, have comorbidities, and bigger tumors. In elderlies with indications for adjuvant radiotherapy, no irradiation (30?%) was associated with increasing age, comorbidity, and the absence of systemic therapy. Hormone therapy was optimal, but only 35?% of elderly women with ER negative tumors received chemotherapy. Compared to elderly women who received adequate treatment, those not receiving surgery (adjusted hazard ratio: 2.30, 95?%CI: 1.10–4.79), or radiotherapy (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.56, 95?%CI: 1.10–2.19), were associated with higher mortality. Less than 25?% of the survival discrepancy between elderly women receiving loco-regional treatment and no treatment were attributed to excess comorbidities in untreated patients. Conclusion: While the presence of comorbidities significantly influenced loco-regional treatment decisions in the elderly, it was only able to explain the lower survival rates in untreated patients up to a certain extent, suggesting missed opportunities for treatment. ? 2016, Soci?t?

Methods A Total of 51 patients with 105 carotid artery plaques were screened using 3D and 2D US probes attached to the same US scanner. Two independent observers characterized the plaques based on the morphological features namely echotexture, echogenicity and surface characteristics. The scores assigned to each morphological feature were used to determine intra- and inter-observer performance. The level of agreement was measured using Kappa coefficient. Results The first observer with 2D US showed fair (k=0.4–0.59) and very strong (k>0.8) with 3D US intra-observer agreements using three morphological features. The second observer indicated moderate strong (k=0.6–0.79) with 2D US and very strong with 3D US (k>0.8) intra-observer performances. Moderate strong (k=0.6–0.79) and very strong (k>0.8) inter-observer agreements were reported with 2D US and 3D US respectively. The results with 2D and 3D US were correlated 62% using only echotexture and 56% using surface morphology coupled with echogenicity. 3D US gave a lower score than 2D 71% of the time (p=0.005) in disagreement cases. Conclusion High reproducibility in carotid plaque characterization was obtained using 3D US rather than 2D US. Hence, it can be a preferred imaging modality in routine or follow up plaque screening of patients with carotid artery disease. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",2D ultrasonography; 3D ultrasonography; Atherosclerosis; Carotid artery plaque; Plaque characterization; Plaque morphology,"Diagnosis; Diseases; Ultrasonography; 3D ultrasonography; Atherosclerosis; Carotid artery; Plaque characterizations; Plaque morphology; Characterization; adult; Article; carotid atherosclerosis; common carotid artery; compensation; controlled study; echography; external carotid artery; female; human; image quality; intermethod comparison; internal carotid artery; major clinical study; male; picture archiving and communication system; priority journal; reproducibility; three dimensional ultrasound; two dimensional ultrasound; ultrasound scanner; aged; atherosclerotic plaque; carotid artery obstruction; diagnostic imaging; echography; middle aged; procedures; three dimensional imaging; very elderly; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carotid Stenosis; Female; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Male; Middle Aged; Plaque, Atherosclerotic; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-84988423808

HRV viral load assays are available but limitations that affect accurate quantification exist. We developed a one-step Taqman assay using oligonucleotides designed based on a comprehensive list of global HRV sequences. The new oligonucleotides targeting the 5′-UTR region showed high PCR efficiency (E = 99.6%, R2 = 0.996), with quantifiable viral load as low as 2 viral copies/μl. Assay evaluation using an External Quality Assessment (EQA) panel yielded a detection rate of 90%. When tested on 315 human enterovirus-positive specimens comprising at least 84 genetically distinct HRV types/serotypes (determined by the VP4/VP2 gene phylogenetic analysis), the assay detected all HRV species and types, as well as other non-polio enteroviruses. A commercial quantification kit, which failed to detect any of the EQA specimens, produced a detection rate of 13.3% (42/315) among the clinical specimens. Using the improved assay, we showed that HRV sheds in the upper respiratory tract for more than a week following acute infection. We also showed that HRV-C had a significantly higher viral load at 2-7 days after the onset of symptoms (p = 0.001). The availability of such assay is important to facilitate disease management, antiviral development, and infection control. ?

The developed computer-aided screening system consisted of two parts, which were the automatic features of extraction and classification. For the automatic features extraction algorithm, the image and spectra of cervical cells features extraction algorithm for extracting the discriminant features of FE-SEM/EDX data was introduced. The system automatically extracted two types of features based on FE-SEM/EDX images and FE-SEM/EDX spectra. Textural features were extracted from the FE-SEM/EDX image using a gray level co-occurrence matrix technique, while the FE-SEM/EDX spectra features were calculated based on peak heights and corrected area under the peaks using an algorithm. A discriminant analysis technique was employed to predict the cervical precancerous stage into three classes: normal, low-grade intraepithelial squamous lesion (LSIL), and high-grade intraepithelial squamous lesion (HSIL). The capability of the developed screening system was tested using 700 FE-SEM/EDX spectra (300 normal, 200 LSIL, and 200 HSIL cases).

Of the many adverse events reported, sexual dysfunction is the most common. To date, however, no standard treatments have been made available to this subgroup of patients. Aim: We conducted a meta-analysis to assess 2 therapeutic options – adjunctive medication or switching to buprenorphine – for treating sexual dysfunction among male patients on methadone maintenance therapy. Methods: Pertinent English-language studies published from inception until January 2016 were identified by searching through PubMed, OVID, Embase, PsycArticles EBSCO, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases. Studies were selected using previously defined criteria. Heterogeneity, publication bias, odds ratios, and effect size were all assessed thoroughly. Results: In all, 826 male participants selected from 11 eligible studies were identified in this meta-analysis. The effect size of treatment with adjunctive medication was at least 3.8 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.5–5.2, p < 0.0001) times greater than that before the intervention. The odds of erectile dysfunction occurring in men treated with methadone were 5.6 times greater (95% CI = 0.06–0.6, p < 0.01) than that in men treated with buprenorphine. Similarly, the odds of sexual desire being lost in men receiving methadone were 14.3 times greater (95% CI = 0.04–0.2, p < 0.01) than those in men receiving buprenorphine. Conclusions: Evidence shows that switching to buprenorphine or using adjunctive treatment reduces sexual dysfunction among male patients on methadone. ?

Transmitted by infected rodents and their excreta, Hantavirus are identified as etiologic agents of two main types of diseases—Hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, the latter having a fatality rate of above 40?%. Although considerable research for over two decades has been going on in this area, bibliometric studies to gauge the state of research of this field have been rare. An analysis of 2631 articles, extracted from WoS databases on Hantavirus between 1980 and 2014, indicated a progressive increase (R2?=?0.93) in the number of papers over the years, with the majority of papers being published in the USA and Europe. About 95?% papers were co-authored and the most common arrangement was 4–6 authors per paper. Co-authorship has seen a steady increase (R2?=?0.57) over the years. We apply research collaboration network analysis to investigate the best-connected authors in the field. The author-based networks have 49 components (connected clump of nodes) with 7373 vertices (authors) and 49,747 edges (co-author associations) between them. The giant component (the largest component) is healthy, occupying 84.19?% or 6208 vertices with 47,117 edges between them. By using edge-weight threshold, we drill down into the network to reveal bonded communities. We find three communities’ hotspots—one, led by researchers at University of Helsinki, Finland; a second, led by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention, USA; and a third, led by Hokkaido University, Japan.

Mental-health literacy research has become a popular topic among scholars in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and many others. However, in Malaysia, studies on mental-health literacy is still in its infancy and confines to a very specialized and limited number of professional experts such as the psychiatrists, medical doctors and the clinical psychologists. As a result, mental health in Malaysia has not received the kind of attention it deserves as compared with other developed countries. Among members of the public, those who come from cultural minority populations are normally the so-called marginalized and disadvantaged ones. This means that many members of these minority populations may have poor mental-health literacy because of their socio-political constraints compared with the mainstream society. Therefore, the aims of this paper are two folds: (1) to review existing literature for understanding the conceptual and methodological issues in undertaking research in mental-health literacy, and (2) to review relevant literature for understanding the unique cultures, specific needs and challenges of being a member of cultural minorities. Drawing on multicultural literature as a theoretical lens, this paper presents an overview of mental-health development in Malaysia, conceptualizes the term mental-health literacy and discusses the cultures, unique needs and challenges of being a member of cultural minorities in Malaysia. ? 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, London.",,,2-s2.0-85070907103

The extract of papaya leaves were shown to improve platelet count in dengue patients. Extracts of papaya pulp based was also shown to induce in vitro IL-6 and stem cell factor in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and stem cells of mesenchymal origin. Different vitamins such as D, E, and C have shown promise to treat dengue disease when taken in small supplementation trials. However, the exact molecular mechanisms on the beneficial roles of either PBE or vitamins are yet to be defined. Hence, the aim of this review is to link the cellular and molecular responses of DENV pathogenesis and pharmacological actions of the bio-active components of PBE or vitamins. It has also been shown that the beneficial roles of PBE and vitamins in DF are linked to thrombopoiesis, prevention of the viral entry and replication, decrease in oxidative damage assisted thrombocytopenia, and the reduction in vascular leakage.

Increasingly, cancer studies utilize the archive of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues in diagnostic pathology departments. Conceptually, such studies would be confounded by physiological telomere attrition and loss of DNA integrity from prolonged tissue storage. Our study aimed to investigate these two confounding factors. 145 FFPE tissues of surgically-resected, non-diseased appendixes were retrieved from our pathology archive, from years 2008 to 2014. Cases from 2013 to 2014 were categorized by patient chronological age (0-20 years, 21-40 years, 41-60 years, > 60 years). Telomere lengths of age categories were depicted by telomere/chromosome 2 centromere intensity ratio (TCR) revealed by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization. Material from individuals aged 0-20 years from years 2013/2014, 2011/2012, 2009/2010, and 2008 were compared for storage effect. Telomere integrity was assessed by telomere fluorescence intensity (TFI). Epithelial TCRs (mean ± SD) for the respective age groups were 4.84 ± 2.08, 3.64 ± 1.21, 2.03 ± 0.37, and 1.93 ± 0.45, whereas corresponding stromal TCRs were 5.16 ± 2.55, 3.84 ± 1.36, 2.49 ± 1.20, and 2.93 ± 1.24. A trend of inverse correlation with age in both epithelial and stromal tissues is supported by r =-0.69, p < 0.001 and r =-0.42, p < 0.001 respectively. Epithelial TFIs (mean ± SD) of years 2013/2014, 2011/2012, 2009/2010 and 2008 were 852.60 ± 432.46, 353.04 ± 127.12, 209.24 ± 55.57 and 429.22 ± 188.75 respectively. Generally, TFIs reduced with storage duration (r =-0.42, p < 0.001). Our findings agree that age-related telomere attrition occurs in normal somatic tissues, and suggest that an age-based reference can be established for telomere studies on FFPE tissues. We also showed that FFPE tissues archived beyond 2 years are suboptimal for telomere analysis. ? 2016 Kong et al.

Three patients achieved >50% seizure reduction at 8 weeks post-treatment, with 2 of them had improvement in the number of IED. All of the responders had FCD. The responders were younger (mean 24.7 vs. 38.3 years old), had shorter duration of illness (mean 15.7 vs. 30.5 years) and had less frequent seizure frequency prior to treatment (mean 5.5 vs. 10.8 attacks per week), as compared to the non-responders. Six patients had improvement in BDI-II scores, two in QOLIE-31 and four in SCL-90 post treatment, irrespective of seizure control. The mean scores in BDI-II improved significantly with treatment (p<0.01). Conclusion: rTMS is a potentially promising treatment for epilepsy, especially in those with FCD, younger age, shorter duration of illness and lower seizure frequency. ? 2016, ASEAN Neurological Association.

Methods: Face and content validity of the Chinese parent proxy and child self-report CHEQOL-25 was verified by an expert panel, and piloted in five children with epilepsy (CWE). The Chinese CHEQOL-25 was then administered to 40 parent proxies and their CWE (aged 8-18 years), from two tertiary hospitals, at baseline and 2 weeks later. Results: Forty parents and their CWE were recruited. Cronbach’s alpha for each subscale ranged from 0.56-0.83. At test-retest, the interclass correlation for all items ranged from 0.68-0.97. Items 8 and 25 were removed as their corrected item-total correlation values were <0.3. Epilepsy severity, the number of anti-epileptic drugs taken daily, number of close friends and number of time spent with friends were found to be associated with the parent proxy CHEQOL-25 score. Duration of epilepsy, child’s cognitive ability, number of close friends and number of time spent with friends were associated with child self-report CHEQOL-25. The parent proxy and the child selfreport showed high to fair agreement on the “interpersonal/social” [Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC)=0.670, p<0.001] and “epilepsy secrecy” subscale (ICC=0.417, p=0.048).

In 2012, an outbreak of Sarcocystis nesbitti infection involving 92 college students and staff occurred after returning from Pangkor Island, Malaysia. A few months after recovering from the febrile illness, some patients complained of hair loss. This study aimed to determine the prevalence, clinical features and outcome of this disorder. Methods: All patients who became sick in the outbreak were asked whether they had the hair loss. For those who had, they were interviewed with standard questionnaires, examined and investigated. Patients were followed-up via an online survey 2 years later. Results: Out of 89 patients who were ill, 19 patients (21.4%) complained of alopecia. The mean peak onset was 4 months after the initial illness. Eleven patients (57.9%) reported the hair fall of more than 100 per day. The other symptoms were itch 10 (52.6%), scaling 10 (52.6%), erythema 4 (21.1%), none had scarring. Eleven patients (57.8%) had positive antinuclear factor with high titre (speckled or nucleolar pattern). Two years after the event, 10 had complete or near complete spontaneous recovery, 1 had partial response and 1 had no improvement. Conclusions: A delayed transient diffuse alopecia is seen in close to half of patients with Sarcocystis nesbittiinfection. This high frequency of positive ANF suggested an immune-mediated mechanism. ? 2016, ASEAN Neurological Association.

In this study, abundances of serum amyloid A (SAA) in patients with pleomorphic sarcoma (PS), chondrosarcoma (CS), and osteosarcoma (OS) were analyzed and compared with those from their respective age-matched healthy control subjects. Results obtained from our analysis by 2DE showed that the levels of SAA were markedly elevated in patients with PS and OS, which are highly metastatic, while in patients with CS, which is a less aggressive sarcoma, the increase appeared less pronounced. A similar trend of altered abundances was also observed when the levels of SAA in the subjects were estimated using Western blot, ELISA, and multiple-reaction monitoring analyses. Absolute quantification using multiple-reaction monitoring further demonstrated that the increased abundance of SAA in patients with PS, OS, and CS was mainly attributed to isoform SAA1. In view of the different degrees of tumor malignancy in PS, OS, and CS, our data suggest their apparent correlation with the levels of SAA in the patients. ? 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This study aims to assess the health-care provider's perception around cervical cancer screening. In-depth, face-to-face interviews were conducted with 16 health-care providers, from both public and private sectors in Az-Zawiya city, Libya, between February and July of 2014.

Our findings suggest that health-care providers did not provide sufficient information regarding cervical cancer screening for women who attend health-care facilities. The results highlight the role played by health-care professionals in motivating women to attend cervical cancer screening programs, and the need for health education of health-care providers to offer a precious advice regarding the screening. On the other hand, health-care providers highlighted that implementation of reminding system of cervical cancer screening will support them to improve screening attendance.

Aims: This research aims to measure the success and effectiveness of the SPP system using three surrogate measures: usage (frequency of use), performance (recognition accuracy) and satisfaction (children's subjective reactions), and how these measures are aligned with the success of the SPP system, as well as to each other. Methods and procedures: We have measured the absolute change in the word error rate (WER) between the pre- and post-training, using the ANOVA test. Correlation co-efficiency (CC) analysis was conducted to test the relation between the surrogate measures, while a Structural Equation Model (SEM) was used to investigate the causal relations between the measures. Outcomes and results: The CC test results indicate a positive correlation between the surrogate measures. The SEM supports all the proposed gtheses. The ANOVA results indicate that SPP is effective in reducing the WER of impaired speech.

Therefore, having new techniques for the early detection of dengue fever, such as the use of dengue test kit, is vitally important. The aims of the study were: 1) identify factors associated with acceptance of a home self-test kit for dengue fever if the dengue test is available to the public and 2) find out the characteristics of the test kits that influence the use of the dengue test kit. Methods: A national telephone survey was carried out with 2,512 individuals of the Malaysian public aged 18-60 years old. Individuals were contacted by random digit dialling covering the whole of Malaysia from February 2012 to June 2013. Results: From 2,512 participants, 6.1 % reported to have heard of the availability of the dengue home test kit and of these, 44.8 % expressed their intention to use the test kit if it was available. Multivariate logistic regressions indicated that participants with primary (OR: 0.65; 95 % CI: 0.43-0.89; p = 0.02, vs. tertiary educational level) and secondary educational levels (OR: 0.73; 95 % CI: 0.57-0.90; p = 0.01, vs. tertiary educational level) were less likely than participants with a tertiary educational level to use a home self-testing dengue kit for dengue if the kit was available. Participants with lower perceived barriers to dengue prevention (level of barriers 0-5) were less likely (OR: 0.67, 95 % CI: 0.53-0.85, p < 0.001, vs. higher perceived barriers) to use a home self-testing dengue kit for dengue if the kit was available compared to those with higher perceived barriers to dengue prevention (level of barriers 6-10). Participants with a lower total dengue fever knowledge score (range 0-22) were also less likely to use a home self-testing dengue kit for dengue if the kit was available (OR: 0.75; 95 % CI: 0.61-0.91, p = 0.001, vs. higher total dengue fever knowledge score) compared to those with a higher total dengue fever knowledge score (range 23-44). With response to characteristics of the test kit, participants indicated that ease of usability and easy to understand instructions were the most important factors influencing the decision to use the dengue home test kit; this was followed by the price of the test kit. Conclusions: The study highlights the need for provision of information to increase knowledge about the home self-testing dengue kit. Educational interventions should target people with low educational levels, those with lower dengue fever knowledge and those with lower perceived barriers to dengue prevention. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Dengue; Home self-test kit; Willingness,"adolescent; adult; attitude to health; awareness; behavior; Communicable Diseases; cost; cross-sectional study; dengue; educational status; female; human; Malaysia; male; mass screening; middle aged; odds ratio; patient attitude; procedures; questionnaire; self care; statistical model; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Awareness; Communicable Diseases; Costs and Cost Analysis; Cross-Sectional Studies; Dengue; Educational Status; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Intention; Logistic Models; Malaysia; Male; Mass Screening; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Patient Acceptance of Health Care; Self Care; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84981731012

Given the recent emergence of several HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) in high-risk populations in the Southeast Asia region, we investigated the genetic diversity of HIV-1 among the blood donors in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. A total of 211 HIV-positive plasma samples detected among 730,188 donations to the National Blood Centre between 2013 and 2014 were provided (90.5% male, median age: 27.0 years old). Recent or long-term infection status at the time of donation was determined using a limiting antigen avidity enzyme immunoassay (LAg-Avidity EIA). HIV-1 gagpol genes were amplified and sequenced from residual plasma for 149 cases followed by genotype determination using phylogenetic and recombination analyses. Transmitted antiretroviral resistance mutations were not observed among the blood donors, among which 22.7% were classified as recent or incident infections. Major circulating HIV-1 genotypes determined by neighbour-joining phylogenetic inference included CRF01-AE at 40.9% (61/149), CRF33-01B at 21.5% (32/149), and subtype B at 10.1% (15/149). Newly-described CRFs including CRF54-01B circulated at 4.0%, CRF74-01B at 2.0%, and CRF53-01B and CRF48-01B at 0.7% each. Interestingly, unique HIV-1 genotypes including African subtype G (8.7%), CRF45-cpx (1.3%), CRF02-AG (0.7%) and CRF07-BC (0.7%) from China were detected for the first time in the country. A cluster of subtype G sequences formed a distinct founder sub-lineage within the African strains. In addition, 8.7% (13/149) of HIV-infected donors had unique recombinant forms (URFs) including CRF01-AE/B' (4.7%), B'/C (2.7%) and B'/G (1.3%) recombinants. Detailed analysis identified similar recombinant structures with shared parental strains among the B'/C and B'/G URFs, some of which were sequenced fromrecently infected individuals, indicating the possible emergence and on-going spread of foreign clades of CRF candidates among the local population.

The serum levels of glucose, insulin, and adiponectin were measured weekly up to 4 weeks. Results: Elevated levels of glucose were observed in all groups on days 7, 14, 21, and 28, except in groups a and f (control). The serum insulin levels were significantly elevated in groups b and c on day 7, when compared with that in group f, whereas a decrease in the serum insulin levels was observed in groups d and e on days 21 and 28. The adiponectin levels showed inconsistencies on days 7 and 14. However, significant decrease in the adiponectin levels was observed on days 21 and 28. Histological section of the pancreas showed mild (group a), moderate (group b) to severe (groups c, d, and e) degenerative changes.

Turnaround time (TAT) is the benchmark to assess the performance of a laboratory, pathologists, and pathology services, but there are few articles on TAT of surgical pathology, particularly in relation to oral or head and neck specimens. This study investigates the TAT for oral histopathology reporting in an academic institution's training laboratory and offers recommendations to achieve better overall quality of diagnostic services. Methods. This study examined data obtained from biopsy request forms for specimens received from the Oro-Maxillofacial Surgery Department of Hospital Tengku Ampuan Rahimah Klang in the Oral Pathology Diagnostic Laboratory of the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Malaya, over a period of 3 years between January 2012 and October 2014. Results. TAT for surgical and decalcified specimens were increased significantly compared to biopsies. Additional special handling did not influence TAT, but increased specimen volume resulted in greater TAT. Slide interpretation was the most time-consuming stage during histopathology reporting. Overall, mean TAT was acceptable for most specimens, but the TAT goals were less than satisfactory. Conclusion. A TAT goal appropriate for this laboratory may hence be established based on this study. Collective efforts to improve the TAT for various specimens are essential for better laboratory performance in the future. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Biopsies; Oral histopathology; Surgical specimens; Turnaround time,"Article; excision; histopathology; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; incision; laboratory personnel; Malaysia; medical audit; oral biopsy; pathologist; postgraduate student; priority journal; staff training; turnaround time; biopsy; laboratory; Mouth Diseases; pathology; standards; time factor; Biopsy; Humans; Laboratories; Malaysia; Mouth Diseases; Pathology, Surgical; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84976496660

Several factors including lifestyle, diet, obesity, heredity and increasing age increase the risk for colon cancer. Cancer nanotechnology is a new emerging field which has the potential to improve the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of colon cancer. Currently, numerous varieties of nanomaterials can be used to prevent and treat colon cancer, including nanotubes, quantum dots, dendrimers, liposomes, hydrogels, and polymeric micells. Colon cancer can be cured by surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, but these therapies often result in infections or multiple side effects. Targeted colon cancer therapies interfere with specific molecules that are involved in cancer growth, progression, and spread. Antiangiogenesis, epidermal growth factor receptor blockers, monoclonal antibody, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinase inhibitors are the major target therapeutic options for colon cancer. Nanotechnology can be applied in targeted colon cancer therapy as it exhibits better selectivity for cancer cells and contributes towards enhancing cancer cell death. ? 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Post-mortem examination determined high S. scabiei density (1309 mites/cm2 skin). It is most probably a genuine emergence, resulting from a new incidence due to the host-taxon derived or prey-to-predator cross-infestation hypotheses, and less probable to be apparent emergence resulting from increased infection in the Himalayan lynx population.

Hence, this paper proposed a Building Performance Risk Rating Tool (BPRT) as an improved measure for building performance evaluation by addressing the users' risk in health and safety aspects. The BPRT is developed from the result of a rating index using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method. 12 facilities management (FM) experts and practitioners were involved in the rating process. The subjective weightings are analysed using the AHP computer software, the Expert Choice 11.

A fit form of house will not only fulfil a basic human need for shelter, but it also contributes to physical and psychological well-being of the occupants. Excellent quality and affordable housing is an indication of a high quality of life. While writings exist on various aspects of the quality of affordable housing in Malaysia, discussion regarding space and design standards has scarcely been given any serious academic attention. Standards concerning residential development usually cover different aspects or stages of the development process. They can include planning standards, design standards, space standards and technical construction standards. The main concern of this paper is on space and design standards specifically. Space standard can be defined as a set of framework which dictates fixed internal space minimums. Meanwhile, design standard indicates design guidelines to ensure the functionality, comfortability and habitability of the house. This paper is concerned exclusively with indoor spaces of a house excluding external circulation spaces and service facilities (in case of strata housing). Its interest is in internal space as an aspect of housing quality. It can be concluded that one of the way forward will be to find the balance between providing adequate minimum spaces for resident satisfactions and having economic values for housing developers. This paper may be used as a valuable reference for authorities and policy makers to better address the best housing space design standards that would benefit not only the occupants, but also the local government and developers alike. ? 2016 The Authors.",,Design; Houses; Housing; Standards; Affordable housing; Construction standards; Development process; External circulation; Psychological well-being; Quality-affordable; Residential development; Service facilities; Architectural design,2-s2.0-84983502916

This cross-sectional study was designed to determine whether these interrelationships are empirically supported. Participants involved in this study were government servants from two ministries in Malaysia (n = 356) and university students from a local university (n = 147). Participants were selected using the non-random purposive sampling method. Data were collected using a self-developed questionnaire, which had been validated in a pilot study involving similar subjects. The questionnaire items were analyzed using Rasch analysis, SPSS version 21 and AMOS version 22. Results have shown that participants who followed a course in Immunology (CoI) had a higher primary HCK (Mean = 0.69 logit, SD = 1.29 logits) compared with those who had not (Mean = -0.27logit, SD = 1.26 logits). Overall, there were significant correlations among the HLS, the awareness of emerging HCC, and the controlled use of HCS (p < 0.001). However, no significant correlations were observed between primary HCK and the other variables. However, significant positive correlation was observed between primary HCK and controlled use of HCS for the group without CoI. Path analysis showed that the awareness of emerging HCC exerted a positive influence on controlled use of HCS (β = 0.156, p < .001) and on HLS (β = 0.224, p < .001). These findings suggest that having CoI helps increase primary HCK which influences controlled use of HCS but does not necessarily influence HLS.

In addition, further investigations on the factors affecting HLS is required to provide a better understanding on the relationship between primary HCK and HLS. ? 2016 Abu Kassim et al.

The present study investigated the effect of edaravone in diabetes mellitus-induced nephropathy in rats. A single administration of streptozotocin (STZ, 55 mg/kg, i.p.) was employed to induce diabetes mellitus in rats. The STZ-administered diabetic rats were allowed for 10 weeks to develop nephropathy. Mean body weight, lipid alteration, renal functional and histopathology were analysed. Diabetic rats developed nephropathy as evidenced by a significant increase in serum creatinine and urea, and marked renal histopathological abnormalities like glomerulosclerosis and tubular cell degeneration. The kidney weight to body weight ratio was increased. Moreover, diabetic rats showed lipid alteration as evidenced by a significant increase in serum triglycerides and decrease in serum high-density lipoproteins. Edaravone (10 mg/kg, i.p., last 4-weeks) treatment markedly prevented the development of nephropathy in diabetic rats by reducing serum creatinine and urea and preventing renal structural abnormalities. In addition, its treatment, without significantly altering the elevated glucose level in diabetic rats, prevented diabetes mellitus-induced lipid alteration by reducing serum triglycerides and increasing serum high-density lipoproteins. Interestingly, the renoprotective effect of edaravone was comparable to that of lisinopril (5 mg/kg, p.o, 4 weeks, standard drug). Edaravone prevented renal structural and functional abnormalities and lipid alteration associated with experimental diabetes mellitus. Edaravone has a potential to prevent nephropathy without showing an anti-diabetic action, implicating its direct renoprotection in diabetic rats. ?

However, the reproducibility for the echocardiographic assessment of variables relevant to IE is unknown. Objectives of this study were: (1) To define the reproducibility for IE echocardiographic variables and (2) to describe a methodology for assessing quality in an observational cohort containing site-interpreted data. IE reproducibility was assessed on a subset of echocardiograms from subjects enrolled in the International Collaboration on Endocarditis registry. Specific echocardiographic case report forms were used. Intra-observer agreement was assessed from six site readers on ten randomly selected echocardiograms. Inter-observer agreement between sites and an echocardiography core laboratory was assessed on a separate random sample of 110 echocardiograms. Agreement was determined using intraclass correlation (ICC), coverage probability (CP), and limits of agreement for continuous variables and kappa statistics (κweighted) and CP for categorical variables. Intra-observer agreement for LVEF was excellent [ICC = 0.93 ± 0.1 and all pairwise differences for LVEF (CP) were within 10 %]. For IE categorical echocardiographic variables, intra-observer agreement was best for aortic abscess (κweighted = 1.0, CP = 1.0 for all readers). Highest inter-observer agreement for IE categorical echocardiographic variables was obtained for vegetation location (κweighted = 0.95; 95 % CI 0.92–0.99) and lowest agreement was found for vegetation mobility (κweighted = 0.69; 95 % CI 0.62–0.86). Moderate to excellent intra- and inter-observer agreement is observed for echocardiographic variables in the diagnostic assessment of IE. A pragmatic approach for determining echocardiographic data reproducibility in a large, multicentre, site interpreted observational cohort is feasible. ? 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Echocardiographic agreement; Echocardiography core laboratory; Infective endocarditis; Reproducibility,"adult; aged; aorta valve disease; aorta valve regurgitation; aorta valve stenosis; aortic abscess; aortic perforation; Article; bacterial endocarditis; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; cohort analysis; echocardiography; female; heart left ventricle function; human; image analysis; image quality; male; observational method; prognostic assessment; reproducibility; test retest reliability; clinical trial; diagnostic imaging; endocarditis; heart stroke volume; middle aged; multicenter study; observer variation; pathophysiology; predictive value; register; retrospective study; transesophageal echocardiography; Adult; Aged; Echocardiography, Transesophageal; Endocarditis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Predictive Value of Tests; Registries; Reproducibility of Results; Retrospective Studies; Stroke Volume; Ventricular Function, Left",2-s2.0-84964389906

The aims of this study are to examine the association between pain catastrophising and MSI and MSD in Malaysian Army male recruits, and evaluate the effects of past injury. Methods A cohort of 611 male Malaysian Army recruits were recruited and followed up at 3 and 6 months. Pain catastrophising, MSD, sociodemographic and work factors were measured using a self-administered questionnaire, and MSI incidence was retrieved from the medical records. Multivariable fixed effects regression was used to model the cumulative incidence of MSD and MSI. Results Approximately 12% of the recruits were diagnosed with incident MSI and 80% reported incident MSD. Higher pain catastrophising at baseline was associated with higher 6 month MSD risk (adjusted OR (aOR) 1.6 per 1 SD increase of Pain Catastrophising Scale (PCS) scores; 95% CI 1.2 to 2.0), and longitudinally associated with MSD incidence (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4). Pain catastrophising was not associated with MSI incidence (aOR 1.0, 95% CI 0.8 to 1.3). The association between pain catastrophising and self-reported MSD was stronger among recruits with self-reported past injury (p for interaction <0.001). Conclusions Pain catastrophising was able to predict symptomatic MSD, and not physician-diagnosed MSI, and these findings are directly related to individual health beliefs. Pain catastrophising has a greater influence on how military recruits perceived their musculoskeletal conditions during training, and efforts to reduce pain catastrophising may be beneficial. ?

This study aimed to explore doctors' approaches to decision support in counseling patients with localized prostate cancer in a country with a less established system of support and care delivery for cancer treatment. Four in-depth interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted with seven government policy makers/consultant urologists, three oncologists Jour private urologists and six urology trainees in Malaysia between 2012 and 2013. Doctors facilitated the treatment decision by explaining about the disease and the treatment options, which included monitoring, side effects and complications of each treatment option. Paper-based (charts and diagram drawings) or electronic (ipad apps and websites) illustrations and physical models were used as patient education aids. Further reading materials and websites links were often provided to patients. Patients were given time till subsequent follow up to decide on the treatment and family involvement was encouraged. Referral to other healthcare professionals (oncologist, radiotherapist or other urologist) for second opinion was offered to the patients. The doctors would recommend patients to speak to prostate cancer survivors for peer support but official support groups were not easily accessible. This study highlighted a multi-faceted approach to support patients with localized prostate cancer in making a treatment decision.

In Malaysia, all four dengue serotypes co-circulates in a dengue season even though any one of the serotypes can predominate. In this study, serum samples were collected from dengue fever and severe dengue fever patients within Klang Valley from 2010-2012 to determine the prevailing dengue serotypes. In addition, sequencing of the envelope/nonstructural 1 (E/NS1) gene junction of the virus isolated was performed to identify the presence of any mutations that are suggestive of increased virulence in the virus. The results showed that Dengue-1 (DEN-1) was the predominant circulating serotype. The E/NS1 gene sequences of the isolates were analysed to trace the evolutionary knowledge of the strains. All sequences of the isolates were compared with DEN-1 prototype Hawaii strain as the reference sequence. The E/NS1 sequences of other dengue strains from neighbouring regions as well as other parts of the world obtained from the GenBank database were also included in the phylogenetic tree analysis. Analyses showed that there was 97% to 100% similarity among the ten isolates at the nucleotide level. Similarly, the amino acid analogue also showed 98% to 100% homology. However, all five non-severe dengue isolates showed variation at position 780, resulting in an amino acid change from valine to alanine as compared to severe dengue isolates. A rooted phylogenetic tree was performed using neighbour-joining method with DEN-2 and DEN-3 as the outgroups. Results showed that all ten isolates were classified as genotype I. In addition, the five isolates from severe dengue patients were found to be clustered together with JN697057 and JN697058, Malaysian DEN-1 strains from the 2005 outbreak. ? 2016, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

Methods: This retrospective study involved 207 hospitalised T2DM patients with hypoglycaemia episodes from January 2008 to December 2012 and was conducted in University Malaya Medical Centre, Petaling Jaya, Malaysia. Patients were classified into 2 groups, viz, those who had hypoglycaemia on admission and those who had hypoglycaemia during hospital stay. Patients with hypoglycemia on admission were those admitted due to hypoglycemia while patients with hypoglycemia during hospital stay were those admitted due to other causes but subsequently developed hypoglycemia during hospitalization. Results: The results for the 207 patients investigated show that most of the patients (72.2%) were asymptomatic during hypoglycemic episodes. The majority of the episodes (57.4%) experienced by the patients were mild hypoglycemia (< 3.9 mmol/L). Old age (p = 0.011) and presence of stroke (p = 0.033) were found to be significantly associated with severe hypoglycemia (< 2.2 mmol/L) while concurrent use of opioid (p = 0.008) was associated with mild hypoglycemia.

It also identifies relevant demographic variables that may likely moderate the relationship among the identified factors. Design/methodology/approach: An in-depth review of the TMS and human capital theory literature was conducted, with a specific attention on their impact to human development. Findings: The extensive review of the relevant literature shows that human development is not only determined by education, health, income, human rights and social justice but also influenced by some demographic variables like educational attainment and gender composition. Originality/value: This paper is a novel attempt whereby an extensive review on the factors of human development is conducted using TMS and identifying the narrowness in the existing framework. The paper will help researchers to better their understanding in this context. It will also provide the policymakers with adequate information on the important factors of human development with the aim to chart a comprehensive policy direction. ? 2016, ?

However, there are several issues that arise in connection to GMO food. The related issues are debated globally as many claim that these foods have the potential for detrimental impacts on public health and the environment. There are some questions pertaining to this matter: Are consumers aware of the side effects of the products they consume in the long run? Are producers willing to disclose their products containing GMO? Is the use of GMO food permissible in religion perspective? Furthermore, in order to sustain businesses, firms should look beyond their economic return by integrating corporate social responsibility (CSR) practice into their operations. This is important since it could lead to resource reduction and improved brand image. Therefore, it is vital to reveal the GMO use in their labelling and packaging in order to inform and create customer awareness. For that reason, this paper attempts to investigate the consumer perception towards GMO food and the CSR of suppliers in dealing with GMO’s products. This study will potentially provide a platform of reference to create consumer awareness towards GMO food. It may also serve as a basis for supplier’s strategic managerial decision-making in CSR and could assist public sectors in formulating policies to facilitate business development related to GMO products. ? 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.",Corporate social responsibility; Food supply chain; Genetics modification organism (GMO),,2-s2.0-84985992300

Information on their molecular epidemiology and evolutionary dynamics in the tropical region of southeast Asia however is limited. Here, we analyzed the phylogenetic, temporal distribution, population history, and clinical manifestations among patients infected with HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E. Nasopharyngeal swabs were collected from 2,060 consenting adults presented with acute URTI symptoms in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, between 2012 and 2013. The presence of HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E was detected using multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The spike glycoprotein, nucleocapsid, and 1a genes were sequenced for phylogenetic reconstruction and Bayesian coalescent inference. A total of 68/2,060 (3.3%) subjects were positive for human alphacoronavirus; HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were detected in 45 (2.2%) and 23 (1.1%) patients, respectively. A peak in the number of HCoV-NL63 infections was recorded between June and October 2012. Phylogenetic inference revealed that 62.8% of HCoV-NL63 infections belonged to genotype B, 37.2% was genotype C, while all HCoV-229E sequences were clustered within group 4. Molecular dating analysis indicated that the origin of HCoV-NL63 was dated to 1921, before it diverged into genotype A (1975), genotype B (1996), and genotype C (2003). The root of the HCoV-229E tree was dated to 1955, before it diverged into groups 1-4 between the 1970s and 1990s.

On the whole, patient that suffers from the hand injury is directly exposed to intricacy when performing daily task. Therefore, many hand aids have been developed to overcome the problem. A typical hand assistive device is able to measure the hand grip strength, which eventually increases its functionality. Like hand dynamometer, it is used for regular screening of hand grip strength and also for the preliminary and ongoing assessment of patients with hand dysfunction or trauma. Strain gauge-based system transducer acts as the measurement system together with Arduino microcontroller for the instrumentation, communication and controlling applications. The integration of strain gauges with a transducer is called a load cell which also made up the overall of force sensor to obtain readings from the hand grip movement. Microcontroller will further use this information to store and analyze data in the SD card. The percentage difference observed between hands across the sample of 25 subjects support the 10% rule.

This study aimed to sequence seven complete HRV-C genomes from Malaysia and compare their genetic characteristics with the 18 published HRV-Cs. Seven Malaysian HRV-C complete genomes were obtained with newly redesigned primers. The seven genomes were classified as HRV-C6, C12, C22, C23, C26, C42, and pat16 based on the VP4/VP2 and VP1 pairwise distance threshold classification. Five of the seven Malaysian isolates, namely, 3430-MY-10/C22, 8713-MY-10/C23, 8097-MY-11/C26, 1570-MY-10/C42, and 7383-MY-10/pat16 are the first newly sequenced complete HRV-C genomes. All seven Malaysian isolates genomes displayed nucleotide similarity of 63-81% among themselves and 63-96% with other HRV-Cs. Malaysian HRV-Cs had similar putative immunogenic sites, putative receptor utilization and potential antiviral sites as other HRV-Cs. The genomic features of Malaysian isolates were similar to those of other HRV-Cs. Negative selections were frequently detected in HRV-Cs complete coding sequences indicating that these sequences were under functional constraint. The present study showed that HRV-Cs from Malaysia have diverse genetic sequences but share conserved genomic features with other HRV-Cs. This genetic information could provide further aid in the understanding of HRV-C infection. ? 2016 Khaw, Chan, Jafar, Othman and Chee.",Complete genome; Genomic feature; HRV-C; Malaysia; Negative selection; Phylogenetic,Article; comparative study; controlled study; gene sequence; genetic analysis; human; Human rhinovirus; Human rhinovirus c; Malaysia; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; virus gene; VP1 gene,2-s2.0-84966412882

This technique is used on the captured image in Dielectrophoresis (DEP) experiment to detect cancer cells (K562). The image processing technique results were measured by referring to mean and standard deviation using histogram. The mean value in the histogram indicates the average number of white and black pixels in that image. The value of standard deviation indicates the processed image able to show overall black and white intensity more precisely. This enables more cells captured and it exhibits more evenly distributed black pixels (cell). The ability of this method has the potential to give a more consistency and reliability in plotting the DEP spectrum from which the electrophysiological parameters were extracted. This would produce a quality image to plot the DEP spectrum and will expedite the progress in identifying the differences between normal and cancerous cells. ? 2015 IEEE.,40150K562 cell; Dielectrophoresis (DEP); Image filtering; Image segmentation; Otsu's method,Cells; Cytology; Electrophoresis; Electrophysiology; Graphic methods; Image segmentation; Pixels; Statistics; Average numbers; Cancerous cells; Image filtering; Image processing technique; Mean and standard deviations; Otsu's method; Processed images; Standard deviation; Image processing,2-s2.0-84966642117

In Malaysia, there is a lack of data exploring the experiences and needs of patients and carers. It is not known whether these needs are being identified accurately by the palliative care providers. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the experiences and needs of patients with life-limiting illnesses receiving community palliative care and the experiences of their formal and informal carers when providing care for the patients. Design: A qualitative study involving individual semi-structured in-depth interviews and focus groups. The interviews and focus group discussion were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, and the transcripts and fields notes were used as data for thematic analysis. Setting/participants: The participants were patients, carers, and healthcare professionals from Hospis Malaysia, an urban community palliative care service in Malaysia. Results: Four main themes emerged: the lack of choice; emotional impact of illness; needs of patients and carers; and the role of spirituality in coping with the illness. The healthcare professionals’ perceptions of patients’ and carers’ needs agreed with the findings from patients and carers. Carers expressed emotional distress and the need for more information and practical advice. Heavy workload was identified as a barrier for the nurses to providing more comprehensive care, including carer support. Conclusions: This study highlighted the differences between perceived and actual needs of patients and carers. Therefore, it is important for healthcare providers to engage patients and carers in decision making, to identify and address their information and emotional needs. ? 2016, ?

RIDL-SIT, a vector control method based on the release of engineered male mosquitoes, has shown promising results from field trials conducted in the Cayman Islands and Brazil. In large scale use, a small proportion of females might be released along with the males. Such females are potential virus vectors; here we investigate the vertical transmission of dengue and chikungunya of homozygous OX513A females.We provided females of OX513A-My1 and a wild type comparator strain with blood meals artificially infected with dengue serotype 1, 2, 3, 4 or chikungunya viruses. For 14 days post-feeding, eggs laid by females were collected. Larvae and their mothers were first tested by qRT-PCR, then by inoculation on cell cultures to search for infectious viral particles. We found no significant difference between the minimum infection rate of OX513A-My1 and wild type females. We also discussed the potential number of females being released, a fraction of the female wild population. Consequently, we conclude that there are no evidence that OX513A-My females, if released into the environment, would cause more harm than their wild counterparts. ? 2016, Malaysian Society for Parasitology.

Blood samples from 303 participants, comprising 133 HIV positive and 170 HIV negative inmates were collected in EDTA and plain tubes. Two mls of each blood sample in plain tubes were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 10 minutes and the sera obtained were subjected to ELISA for detection of Toxoplasma IgM and IgG antibody towards Toxoplasma antigen. Seropositive samples for Toxoplasma IgM or both Toxoplasma IgM and IgG were further tested with Novalisa Toxoplasma gondii IgG avidity test to rule out acute from latent infections. Blood in EDTA tubes were sent to Clinical Diagnostic Lab (CDL), University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Kuala Lumpur for complete blood count and differential count analysis. Overall seroprevalence of anti-T. gondii antibodies was detected in 41.9% (127 out of 303) of the participants.

Entrusted with policy-making and legislative powers, they therefore play a crucial role in the rising health debates on radio frequency (RF) emissions from telecommunication structures. RF exposure from the proliferation of base stations and rooftop antennas in Malaysia triggers concerns as a growing number of people claim that it is cancer causing and as such a health hazard. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate the representation of the various social actors in the government departments and agencies in Malaysia in the health debates on RF exposure from telecommunication structures. Using van Leeuwen’s social actor framework, this research aims to reveal the kinds of identities that are embedded in the discourse, specifically on how this group of social actors represent themselves in the health debates. The data is from five (5) face-to-face interviews with representatives from the regulator of the telecommunication industry, the health department and the local town councils. The findings suggest that the members of this stakeholder group are decision makers and interdependent in handling this perceived health risk.

We describe the prevalence of identifying as being ‘top’, ‘bottom’, ‘versatile’, or ‘don’t know/not applicable’ among Malay and Chinese MSM in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, and behavioural outcomes according to these labels for sexual role identity. Data analysis was conducted on a survey administered during weekly outreach throughout Kuala Lumpur in 2012. Pearson’s Chi square tests were used to compare demographic and behavioural characteristics of MSM who reported roles for anal sex. Binary logistic regression was used to explore the odds of behavioural outcomes among MSM who identified as ‘bottom’, ‘versatile,’ and ‘don't know' compared to MSM who reported that ‘top' was their sexual role. Labels for anal sex roles were significantly associated with condom use for last anal sex. Among MSM who used labels for anal sex roles, MSM who identified as ‘bottom’ had highest level of not using condoms for last anal sex (24.1%, p =.045). In binary logistic regression model, identifying as ‘top’ was significantly associated with reporting using a condom during last anal sex and reported consistent condom use for anal sex in the past six months (p =.039 and.017, respectively). With regard to sexual role identity, some MSM may be a part of a special subgroup of at-risk men to be targeted. Future research should evaluate the origins, meanings, and perceptions of these labels, and the developmental process of how these MSM identify with any of these categories. Research should also uncover condom use decision making with regard to these labels for sexual positioning. ? 2016, ?

The operant runway apparatus consisted of three long runways arranged in a zig-zag manner. The methodology consisted of six distinct phases: habituation, preconditioning, conditioning, post-conditioning, extinction and reinstatement. The effects of saline were compared with escalating doses of either ethanol (0.5-4.0 g/kg, i.p), heroin (5-40 mg/kg, i.p), or nicotine (0.1-0.5mg/kg, i.p) administered in the goal box during the conditioning phase (day 1 to day 5). A significant decrease in the time of trained (conditioned) mice to reach the goal box confirmed the subjects' motivation to seek those drugs on day 6 (expression). The mice were then subjected to non-rewarded extinction trials for 5 days over which run times were significantly increased. After 5 days of abstinence, a priming dose of ethanol or heroin (1/5th of maximum dose used in conditioning) significantly reinstated the drug-seeking behavior. These results suggest that the modified runway model can serve as a powerful behavioral tool for the study of the behavioral and neurobiological bases of drug self-administration and, as such, is appropriate simple but powerful tool for investigating the drug-seeking behavior of laboratory mice. ? 2016, Nature Publishing Group.

Hernia meshes have been developed incorporating coatings of active agents. One commercially available mesh has a fish oil coating which is promoted as having anti-inflammatory properties. We report a case, a symptomatic foreign body granuloma reaction associated with a fish oil coated polypropylene mesh, which required eventual mesh explantation. Case presentation: A 61-year old lady with previous peptic ulcer disease underwent a laparoscopic intraperitoneal placement of mesh for incisional hernia utilising a fish oil coated polypropylene mesh. The patient presented 3 months after the procedure complaining of dyspepsia and pain at the operative site. There was no discharge. The patient was managed conservatively. She presented 10 months post-operatively with progressively worsening symptoms and a hard palpable mass in the epigastrium. Abdominal laparoscopy revealed dense adhesive disease around the mesh with exudates. Adhesiolysis, mesh explantation and a partial gastrectomy was performed. Histopathological examination revealed a foreign body granuloma formation to the mesh. Conclusion: In-vivo studies looking at intraperitoneal mesh placement with fish oil coatings including data on surgical outcomes such as fistula and adhesive characteristics are scarce in the literature.

This paper presents the findings of a preliminary survey, which is the establishment of performance-risk indicators (PRIs) as an initial construct for the development of BP rating tool. The construct items consist of three criteria as the main focus, namely performance element, risk frames and the indicators. Design/methodology/approach – This paper adopts a qualitative approach to achieve the outcome for the preliminary survey. The determinants of the indicators were preliminarily compiled from literature and previous established BP evaluation (BPE) schemes. The initial construct of indicators are then further confirmed through semi-structured interviews involving 18 building operators in Malaysia’s public university buildings. Their views are needed to obtain suitability of the listed indicators for BP rating assessment to be used in the local HEB. The transcription and interpretation from the interview findings are carried out using Atlas.ti? qualitative software. Findings – The interpretation of the interview findings has supported the justification for this paper that there is no proactive action in executing BP assessment to mitigate risk towards users’ health and safety. The findings also revealed that there are 26 indicators that are rated as suitable to be used for the local context of Malaysia’s HEBs. The indicators are categorised under three performance elements, which are functional performance (FP), technical performance (TP) and indoor environmental performance (IEP). Research limitations/implications – Because the chosen building sample is HEBs, the indicators may not be generalised as the suitability of the items were determined from the respective operators. Therefore, it is recommended that further research is carried out for other types of buildings. Practical implications – The proposed PRIs have a significant role in the building maintenance and management in HEBs. The result is able to suggest methods for the management to improve and optimise the BP aspects by focusing occupants’ health and safety risk as a reactive process. Originality/value – This paper highlights the benefits of integrating two previously separate fields: BP and risk management (RM) and, thus, helps providing opportunities for improvement of BP and the relationships with risk and satisfaction of the users. It may initiate a new perspective in optimising the BP and mitigating the health, safety and environmental risk by sensitivity to changing needs of occupants in HEB. ? 2016, ?

STUDY DESIGN: The study was conducted at University Malaya Medical Center, Kuala Lumpur, and involved 32 women with preeclampsia and 32 healthy pregnant women (matched by parity and gestational age). A validated FFQ was used to collect information regarding dietary intake of genistein during their pregnancy. The association between preeclampsia and the level of genistein intake was evaluated by categorizing the participants into 3 groups according to tertiles of estimated genistein intake. RESULTS: The odds ratio estimates showed a four-fold increase in the risk of developing preeclampsia for tertile 1 (lowest intake) as compared with tertile 3 (highest intake) (crude OR, 4.38; 95% CI 1.21–15.81). CONCLUSION: Lower levels of genistein intake were associated with an increased risk of developing preeclampsia. These findings suggest a possible beneficial role of genistein in the prevention of preeclampsia. ?

A number of mechanisms, such as polymer bridging, polymer adsorption, charge neutralization (including electrostatic patch effects), coagulation/flocculation, and adsorption have been suggested to describe the destabilization of colloids and suspensions by biopolymers. A number of factors, such as sorption capacity of biopolymers, concentration of biopolymers, DO, NO3-, pH, additives, extracellular polymeric substances, and microbial immobilization time, have been optimized to enhance the efficiency of biopolymers in biofiltration/biobarrier systems. Beside this, biopolymers in combination with other polymers, biopolymers, and microorganisms have been successfully employed as biofilters/biobarriers. In order to enhance application and decrease prolonged startup procedures of a biofilter, such systems are often seeded with microbes of interest to expedite quick biofilm development. Upflow packed bed bioreactors using microbial cellulose have greater than 90% denitrification capacity. Fixed-bed bioreactors using magnetic chitosan and polycaprolactone have excellent efficiency to remediate Cu, P, As(V), As(III), and NO3-.

Methods: Four in-depth individual interviews and three focus group discussions were conducted with urologists (n=11), urology trainees (n=5), oncologists (n=3) and policy makers (n=1) in Malaysia in 2012-2013. A semi-structured interview guide was used to facilitate the interviews, which were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and checked. Thematic approach was used to analyze the data. Results: Challenges reported by HCPs in supporting patients in making decisions about prostate cancer treatment consisted of patient, social, healthcare professionals and health system factors. Patient-related challenges were: distrust of HCPs, difficulty in communicating information, preconceptions, attitudes to treatment, preparedness for decision making, viewing prostate cancer as taboo and fear of treatment complications, or side-effects. Social factors, such as influence of family or others, also posed a problem for HCPs seeking to support patients' decision-making. HCP-related challenges included: differences of opinion among HCPs, uncertainty about the best treatment option and lack of interdisciplinary cooperation. Healthcare system factors challenges included: lack of support staff, time constraints, treatment availability and treatment costs. HCPs suggested that delivery of care by multi-disciplinary teams, and more use of audio-visual media, would help patients to make decisions. Conclusions: HCPs faced various challenges in supporting patients with prostate cancer in making decisions about treatment.

This study aims to investigate the Malaysian living donors’ follow-up attendance, their preferences on medical-institutional facilities, and the financial circumstances pertaining to the follow-up costs Materials and Methods: Primary data were collected through a survey of 80 living donors who made their donation at the University of Malaya Medical Center (UMMC) between 1991 and 2012. Results: Out total of 178 donors, only 111 were reachable and 80 of them participated in the survey (72%). The findings revealed that most of the donors (71.2%) attend the follow-up regularly. Nevertheless, donors seem to neglect the importance of follow-up as they consider themselves healthy (28.9%) or consider the follow-up as being troublesome (28.9%). Most donors (67.5%) are not in favour of being treated as patients, but prefer to be monitored under donor registry (88.8%) and getting their health service in special clinics for donors (80%). The majority of the donors fund the follow-up costs themselves (32.4%), while 25% of the donors’ follow-up costs were funded by family members. Among those donors without income and those of low-income (84.8% of respondents), 60.3% believe that the follow-up costs should be borne by the government. Conclusions: Based on the findings, it is therefore suggested that the government provides all living donors with proper free health service through donor registry and donor clinics. Adequate care has to be given to the donors to pre-empt any unforeseen health complications due to the organ donation surgical procedures. ? 2016, Journal of University Malaya Medical Centre.

Methods: The effects of the above mentioned factors on the levels of urinary advanced oxidation protein product (AOPP) and other oxidative indices such as hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), malondialdehyde (MDA) and ferric-reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) were evaluated according to well-established methods. Results: The period of sample collection did not show any significant difference in the parameters tested. The levels of oxidative stress in breast and colorectal cancer patients that generally increased with the cancer stages showed that cancer progression correlates with high oxidative damage. Comparison between diabetes with and without hypertension did not give any significant difference in the parameters tested. Among all the four oxidative indices, the level of AOPP in breast, colorectal and other types of cancers were significantly higher compared to diabetes with or without hypertension.

The concentration of surface functional groups can be tuned by variation of the monomers thus a careful control over surface properties can be achieved. This chapter also reviews the principles of applied characterization techniques such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), water-in-air contact angle (WCA) measurement and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) that have been used for investigation of the developed platforms.

The DLA cluster formed through DLA is formed by particles moving in Brownian motion (diffusion) which meet and stick together randomly (aggregation) to form the cluster. The simulation of multiple cluster fractals is done using DLA methods incorporating different parameters such as its sticking coefficient, lattice geometry and number of particles. To compare the simulation with the real patterns obtained, one vital aspect would be the calculation of their fractal dimension values. The computer program developed is able to calculate the fractal dimension value of each of the simulated fractal patterns. Suitable fractal dimension calculation method is employed according to its usefulness and efficiency.

These values showed that all investigated metals were not hazardous or not posing potential risk for the average and high level fish consumers. However, in some locations with high metal concentrations, were found to exceed the recommended maximum permissible safety limits, while THQ values also exceeded 1, suggesting that the water andfish of some locations or fish farms are not completely safe for human health.

HeV was recognized in Australia 1994 in horses exhibiting respiratory disease along with a human case fatality, and then NiV was identified during a large outbreak of human cases of encephalitis with high mortality in Malaysia and Singapore in 1998-1999 along with respiratory disease in pigs which served as amplifying hosts. The recently identified third henipavirus isolate, Cedar virus (CedPV), is not pathogenic in animals susceptible to HeV and NiV disease. Molecular detection of additional henipavirus species has been reported but no additional isolates of virus have been reported. Central pathological features of both HeV and NiV infection in humans and several susceptible animal species is a severe systemic and often fatal neurologic and/or respiratory disease. In people, both viruses can also manifest relapsed encephalitis following recovery from an acute infection, particularly NiV. The recognized natural reservoir hosts of HeV, NiV, and CedPV are pteropid bats, which do not show clinical illness when infected. With spillovers of HeV continuing to occur in Australia and NiV in Bangladesh and India, these henipaviruses continue to be important transboundary biological threats. NiV in particular possesses several features that highlight a pandemic potential, such as its ability to infect humans directly from natural reservoirs or indirectly from other susceptible animals along with a capacity of limited human-to-human transmission. Several henipavirus animal challenge models have been developed which has aided in understanding HeV and NiV pathogenesis as well as how they invade the central nervous system, and successful active and passive immunization strategies against HeV and NiV have been reported which target the viral envelope glycoproteins. ?

Although recent studies have revealed the ability of these stem cells in multipotential attribute, their efficiency of hepatic lineage differentiation has not been addressed so far. The aim of this study is to investigate hepatic lineage fate competence of periodontal ligament stem cells through direct media induction. Differentiation of periodontal ligament stem cells into hepatocyte-like cells was conducted by the exposure of two phase media induction. First phase was performed in the presence of hepatocyte growth factors to induce a definitive endoderm formation. In the subsequent phase, the cells were treated with oncostatin M and dexamethosone followed by insulin and transferrin to generate hepatocyte-like cells. Hepatic-related characters of the generated hepatocyte-like cells were determined at both mRNA and protein level followed by functional assays. Foremost changes observed in the generation of hepatocytelike cells were the morphological features in which these cells were transformed from fibroblastic shape to polygonal shape. Temporal expression of hepatic markers ranging from early endodermal up to late markers were detected in the hepatocytelike cells. Crucial hepatic markers such as glycogen storage, albumin, and urea secretion were also shown. These findings exhibited the ability of periodontal ligament stem cells of dental origin to be directed into hepatic lineage fate. These cells can be regarded as an alternative autologous source in the usage of stem cell-based treatment for liver diseases. ?

First described in 1952 in Tanzania, CHIKV remained a relatively neglected tropical virus, despite causing sporadic outbreaks in Africa and Asia over the next few decades. However, since 2004, an epidemic lineage of the East/Central/South African (ECSA) genotype has arisen in East Africa and spread to cause unprecedented global outbreaks in the Indian Ocean islands, South and Southeast Asia, as well as autochthonous outbreaks in Europe. This spread was driven by mutations in the virus envelope proteins that improved the vectorial competence of Ae. albopictus, which is widely distributed in the affected areas, and which was previously considered a vector of secondary importance to Ae. aegypti. In 2011, the Asian lineage of CHIKV emerged to cause outbreaks in Pacific islands, before unexpectedly spreading to cause explosive epidemics in the Caribbean and Latin America, mainly via Ae. aegypti. The factors behind the global spread of previously niche arboviruses such as CHIKV and more recently Zika virus are complex, multifactorial and poorly understood. The implications on strained health services and economies are considerable, particularly as CHIKV is associated with long-term rheumatological disorders. However, with the increasing ease of global travel and the growing geographical distributions of Aedes mosquito vectors, we should expect further spread of exotic arboviruses to new populations who remain entirely immunologically naive. ? 2016 CAB International.",Chikungunya; Diagnosis; Epidemiology; Vector; Virus,,2-s2.0-85014050816

Conventional diets have limited success in achieving weight loss in this population. Lowering dietary glycaemic index (GI) is known to facilitate weight loss in insulin-resistant women. This study evaluated the effects of including GI education within the conventional healthy dietary recommendation (CHDR) framework, on body weight and composition of women post-GDM. Methods: Seventy-seven, non-diabetic, women with previous GDM (aged 20-40y, mean BMI: 26.4±4.6kg/m2) were randomised into two groups: subjects who received CHDR only (CHDR, n=38) and those who received low-GI education in addition (LGI, n= 39). The outcome of these interventions on body weight, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip-ratio (WHR), body fat and dietary intakes were assessed after one year. Clinically significant weight loss was defined as achieving a minimum of 5% weight loss from the baseline body weight. Results: After one year, as compared to CHDR, a significantly greater proportion of LGI subjects had 7% (28.2% vs. 5.3%, p =0.01) and 10% (15.4% vs. 0%, p =0.025) weight loss from baseline. WC significantly reduced in both groups (p &lt; 0.004); however, only LGI subjects had significant WHR reduction (-0.02± 0.04, p=0.035). One-year mean increases in total (1.2±2.4kg, p= 0.008) and trunk fat (0.65±1.4kg, p= 0.019) were significant only within the CHDR group, although the changes were not significantly different between the groups. After intervention, LGI as compared to CHDR diets, had lower GI (58±4 vs.64±7, p &lt; 0.001) and higher dietary fibre (17±4 vs. 13±4g, p &lt; 0.001). Conclusion: Including GI education within the CHDR framework for women with prior GDM, increases their likelihood of achieving 7% weight loss and significant WHR reductions in one year.",Diet; Gestational diabetes mellitus; Glycaemic index; Glycaemic load; Prevention; Type 2 diabetes,,2-s2.0-85011410587

Methods: Forty-eight fasted male Sprague-Dawley rats were induced diabetes using a single intraperitoneal injection of NA(110 mg/kg b.w.) and STZ (65 mg/kg b.w, 15 min after NA). Diabetic rats orally received either different concentrations (250, 500 and 750 mg/kg body weight) of ginger rhizome suspension or glibenclamide (10 mg/kg body weight) for 6 weeks. Two control diabetic and normal groups were gavaged with only distilled water as a vehicle. Results: The results indicated that the lower concentrations of ginger modulated body weight, fasting blood glucose, level of triglyceride and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (p<0.05). In contrast, ginger could not enhance atherogenic indices due to a decline in the level of HDL-c. Immunological features of ginger were evident by a significant lymphocyte proliferation in all treated groups at stimulation by 5 mg/ml PHA (p<0.001). Level of CD45ra+ (B cell marker) increased significantly in the lowest dose of ginger (p<0.05, 58%), and 250 mg/kg body weight of ginger was found to be safe for not altering the level of CD4+CD25+ marker (p>0.05).

Aedes Aegypti and Aedes Albopictus have been incriminated in the transmission of dengue virus in many urban areas of South-East Asia, including Malaysia. Dengue cases that have been reported worldwide were related with high rise buildings especially in residential buildings such as apartments and condominiums. This study aims to identify the breeding habitats resulted from building designs in high-rise apartments in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Inspections were conducted at three dengue-hotspots residential buildings located in Lembah Pantai, Kuala Lumpur. The selection criteria of the study sites were based on the most frequent reports on dengue cases from these three localities. The building elements that Aedes breeding were spotted created semi-permanent areas for Aedes breeding. Findings show the buildings were designed with unreachable rain gutters, making checking and cleaning for mosquito breeding in clogged gutters impossible for local residents. Poor drainage and piping system has found to be the Aedes habitats, too. Of these, surprisingly, uneven surface of the concrete rooftops and floors has also become one of the breeding spots, resulting to water stagnation and liveable areas for Aedes to breed. Correlating this findings not only helps target areas to be identified and focused in community search and destroy programs, but most importantly it contributes to high-rise building design and construction features in Malaysia by taking into considerations long-lasting measures for a holistic sustainable environment. ? 2016 by MIP.",Aedes; Dengue; High-rise building; Prevention; Sustainable neighbourhood,,2-s2.0-85008957407

The research focused on investigating how people construct the meaning attributed to commuting mode of travel to work. Using multiple embedded case study research approach, this research focuses on 19 semistructured interviews with employees from two neighbouring but contrasting case study areas of Kuala Lumpur. Synthesis of the employees' experiences on their travel behaviour exposed replication logic on the way they perceived walking as part of the transportation mode of travelling to work. The implicit understanding of the walking to work includes; definition of walking to work by the communities, specific walking stages and its' characteristic during am-pm rush hours, the travel pattern and modes of transportation from the origin point (home) to the office, and the understanding of walking benefits to their economy, environment, health and social.

Cytotoxicity or killing tumor cells that divide rapidly is the basic function of chemotherapeutic drugs. However, these agents can damage normal dividing cells, leading to adverse effects in the body. In view of great advances in cancer therapy, which are increasingly reported each year, we quantitatively and qualitatively evaluated the papers published between 1981 and December 2015, with a closer look at the highly cited papers (HCPs), for a better understanding of literature related to cytotoxicity in cancer therapy. Online documents in the Web of Science (WOS) database were analyzed based on the publication year, the number of times they were cited, research area, source, language, document type, countries, organization-enhanced and funding agencies. A total of 3,473 publications relevant to the target key words were found in the WOS database over 35 years and 86% of them (n=2,993) were published between 2000-2015. These papers had been cited 54,330 times without selfcitation from 1981 to 2015. Of the 3,473 publications, 17 (3,557citations) were the most frequently cited ones between 2005 and 2015. The topmost HCP was about generating a comprehensive preclinical database (CCLE) with 825 (23.2%) citations. One third of the remaining HCPs had focused on drug discovery through improving conventional therapeutic agents such as metformin and ginseng. Another 33% of the HCPs concerned engineered nanoparticles (NPs) such as polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendritic polymers, PTX/SPIO-loaded PLGAs and cellderived NPs to increase drug effectiveness and decrease drug toxicity in cancer therapy. The remaining HCPs reported novel factors such as miR-205, Nrf2 and p27 suggesting their interference with development of cancer in targeted cancer therapy. In conclusion, analysis of 35-year publications and HCPs on cytotoxicity in cancer in the present report provides opportunities for a better understanding the extent of topics published and may help future research in this area.",Anticancer treatments; Cancer; Cancer therapy; Cytotoxicity; Highly cited papers,"antineoplastic agent; adverse drug reaction; bibliometrics; factual database; human; journal impact factor; Neoplasms; publication; research; Antineoplastic Agents; Bibliometrics; Databases, Factual; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Journal Impact Factor; Neoplasms; Publications; Research",2-s2.0-84983247508

Our study shows for the first time that the P. falciparum specific MAP kinase 2 (PfMAP2) is colocalized in the nucleus of all of the asexual erythrocytic stages of P. falciparum and is particularly elevated in its phosphorylated form. It was also discovered that PfMAP2 is expressed in its highest quantity during the early trophozoite (ring form) stage and significantly reduced in the mature trophozoite and schizont stages. Although the phosphorylated form of the kinase is always more prevalent, its ratio relative to the nonphosphorylated form remained constant irrespective of the parasites' developmental stage. We have also shown that the TSH motif specifically renders PfMAP2 genetically divergent from the other plasmodial MAP kinase activation sites using Neighbour Joining analysis. Furthermore, TSH motif-specific designed antibody is crucial in determining the location of the expression of the PfMAP2 protein. However, by using immunoelectron microscopy, PPfMAP2 were detected ubiquitously in the parasitized erythrocytes. In summary, PfMAP2 may play a far more important role than previously thought and is a worthy candidate for research as an antimalarial. ? 2016 Farah Aida Dahalan et al.",,"mitogen activated protein kinase; plasmodium falciparum mitogen activated protein kinase 2; unclassified drug; antibody; antimalarial agent; protozoal protein; Article; developmental stage; immunoelectron microscopy; nonhuman; parasite development; Plasmodium falciparum; protein expression; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; schizont; sexual maturation; trophozoite; animal; biology; cell nucleus; chemistry; enzyme specificity; enzymology; erythrocyte; fluorescence microscopy; gene expression regulation; human; indirect fluorescent antibody technique; Malaria, Falciparum; parasitology; phosphorylation; phylogeny; physiology; Plasmodium falciparum; protein motif; rabbit; signal transduction; Amino Acid Motifs; Animals; Antibodies; Antimalarials; Cell Nucleus; Computational Biology; Erythrocytes; Fluorescent Antibody Technique, Indirect; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Humans; Malaria, Falciparum; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Microscopy, Immunoelectron; Phosphorylation; Phylogeny; Plasmodium falciparum; Protozoan Proteins; Rabbits; Substrate Specificity; Trophozoites",2-s2.0-84982085524

To best direct the limited resource to support social services for individuals with disability, there is a need to objectively measure social participation restriction. A number of tools to measure levels of social participation are available, but none of them has been translated into the Malay language. This cross-sectional study examined the test-retest reliability and concurrent validity of the Life Habits Assessment (LIFE-H 3.1) that had been translated and culturally adapted to the Malay language. Methods: Seventy-fi ve individuals with physical disabilities (age, mean [standard deviation] = 58 [10] years; 49 males) participated in this study. Participants were interviewed twice with the Malay version LIFE-H 3.1, approximately 1 week apart. The Barthel Index (BI) and the World Health Organization Assessment of Quality of Life-Brief version (WHOQoLBREF) were administered in the fi rst interview as well. Intraclass correlation coeffi cients and the Bland-Altman Bias D were used to examine test-retest reliability. The Spearman correlation coeffi cients were computed to quantify the correlation between the Malay version LIFE-H 3.1 and the BI and the WHOQoL-BREF, respectively, to examine the concurrent validity of the Malay version LIFE-H 3.1. Furthermore, standard error of measurement and minimal detectable change were calculated. Results: The Malay version LIFE-H 3.1 had excellent testretest reliability as evidenced by good to excellent intraclass correlation coeffi cients (0.71-0.95) and minimal Bland- Altman biases (0.01-0.12). The correlations between the Malay version LIFE-H 3.1 and the BI were fair to good ( r = 0.28-0.69). The correlations between the Malay version LIFEH 3.1 and the WHOQoL-BREF were weak to fair, ranging from 0.02 to 0.57. Conclusions: The Malay version LIFE-H 3.1 demonstrates excellent test-retest reliability and satisfactory validity.

In Malaysia it remains to be a great concern among clinicians; yet published works on survival of cervical cancer patients are somewhat limited. In this study, two survival regression models which are parametric Stratified Weibull model and Weibull Accelerated Failure Time (AFT) model are considered as the alternative and improvement of the well-known Cox proportional hazard model to evaluate the prognostic factor that effect on survival of patients with cervical cancer. Comparisons were made to find the best model. Data were taken from Hospital University Science Malaysia (HUSM) over a period of 12 years. From the analyses it was found that the AFT model was the most appropriate. The AFT model has shown that the median survival time for patient at stage III & IV (14 months) is about one third that of those at stages I & II (40 months) for the same distant metastasis group.

Aims This study aimed to identify factors determining the sexual activity, awareness and use of contraception among college students in Malaysia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted among students aged 17–24 years in four colleges of Malaysia. Data were collected via a self-administered multiple response questionnaire. Data analysis was performed on 552 completed questionnaires. Results The mean age of the participants was 19.7±1.6 years. The majority of the respondents were females, Malays, residing in rented accommodations. Contraceptive awareness, sexual activity and use of contraception increased significantly with age of the respondents and were more in males. Better contraceptive awareness was found in those staying away from parents and those studying in colleges with urban exposure. Almost 40 per cent respondents had indulged in sexual activity but only 37 per cent reported use of contraception. A significantly higher proportion of respondents who did not use contraception were females, those in the age group of 19–20 years old and those who were studying in colleges with rural exposure. Male students were more likely to engage in sexual activity and use contraception compared to females.

The two common causes of CKD are diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Other causes of CKD also include polycystic kidney disease, obstructive uropathy and primary glomerulonephritis. The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a multi-ligand cell surface receptor of the immunoglobulin superfamily and it has been associated with kidney disease in both non-diabetic and diabetic patients. Presently, data on the association between RAGE polymorphisms and CKD in the Malaysian population is limited, while numerous studies have reported associations of RAGE polymorphisms with diabetic complications in other populations. The present study aims to explore the possibility of using RAGE polymorphisms as candidate markers of CKD in Malaysian population by using association analysis. Methods: A total of 102 non-diabetic CKD patients, 204 diabetic CKD patients and 345 healthy controls were enrolled in the study. DNA isolated from blood samples were subjected to genotyping of RAGE G82S, -374T/A, -429T/C, 1704G/T and 2184A/G polymorphisms using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 63-bp deletion, a polymorphism in the RAGE gene promoter, was genotyped using conventional PCR method and visualized using agarose gel electrophoresis. The collective frequencies of genotypes with at least one copy of the minor alleles of the four polymorphisms were compared between the non-diabetic CKD patients, diabetic CKD patients and healthy controls. Results: After adjustment of age, gender and ethnic groups in binary logistic regression analysis, the G82S CT + TT genotypes were associated with non-diabetic CKD patients when compared with diabetic CKD patients (p = 0.015, OR = 1.896, 95% CI = 1.132-3.176). After further adjustment of CKD comorbidities, the G82S CT + TT genotypes were still associated with non-diabetic CKD patients when compared with diabetic CKD patients (p = 0.011, OR = 2.024, 95% CI = 1.178- 3.476). However, it cannot be suggested that G82S polymorphism was associated with CKD in non-diabetic patients in this study. This is because there were no significant differences in the frequencies of G82S CT + TT genotypes between non-diabetic CKD patients and healthy controls. In addition, the RAGE -374T/A, -429T/C, 1704G/T, 2184A/G and 63-bp deletion polymorphisms were also not associated with non-diabetic CKD patients and diabetic CKD patients in this study. Conclusion: The G82S, -374T/A, -429T/C, 1704G/T, 2184A/G and 63-bp deletion polymorphisms examined in this study were not associated with chronic kidney disease in the Malaysian patients. ? 2016 Wong et al.",Chronic kidney disease; Polymorphisms; RAGE,advanced glycation end product receptor; adult; agar gel electrophoresis; Article; cerebrovascular accident; chronic kidney disease; DNA extraction; DNA polymorphism; dyslipidemia; female; gene deletion; gene frequency; genotyping technique; human; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; major clinical study; Malaysian; male; promoter region; real time polymerase chain reaction; single nucleotide polymorphism,2-s2.0-84966262743

The gram-negative Neisseria is associated with two of the most potent human epidemic diseases: Meningococcal meningitis and gonorrhoea. In both cases, disease is caused by bacteria colonizing human mucosal membrane surfaces. Overall, the genus shows great diversity and genetic variation mainly due to its ability to acquire and incorporate genetic material from a diverse range of sources through horizontal gene transfer. Although a number of databases exist for the Neisseria genomes, they are mostly focused on the pathogenic species. In this present study we present the freely available NeisseriaBase, a database dedicated to the genus Neisseria encompassing the complete and draft genomes of 15 pathogenic and commensal Neisseria species. Methods. The genomic data were retrieved from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and annotated using the RAST server which were then stored into the MySQL database. The protein-coding genes were further analyzed to obtain information such as calculation of GC content (%), predicted hydrophobicity and molecular weight (Da) using in-house Perl scripts. The web application was developed following the secure four-tier web application architecture: (1) client workstation, (2) web server, (3) application server, and (4) database server. The web interface was constructed using PHP, JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX and CSS, utilizing the model-view-controller (MVC) framework. The in-house developed bioinformatics tools implemented in NeisseraBase were developed using Python, Perl, BioPerl and R languages. Results. Currently, NeisseriaBase houses 603,500 Coding Sequences (CDSs), 16,071 RNAs and 13,119 tRNA genes from 227 Neisseria genomes. The database is equipped with interactive web interfaces. Incorporation of the JBrowse genome browser in the database enables fast and smooth browsing of Neisseria genomes. NeisseriaBase includes the standard BLAST program to facilitate homology searching, and for Virulence Factor Database (VFDB) specific homology searches, the VFDB BLAST is also incorporated into the database. In addition, NeisseriaBase is equipped with in-house designed tools such as the Pairwise Genome Comparison tool (PGC) for comparative genomic analysis and the Pathogenomics Profiling Tool (PathoProT) for the comparative pathogenomics analysis of Neisseria strains. Discussion. This user-friendly database not only provides access to a host of genomic resources on Neisseria but also enables high-quality comparative genome analysis, which is crucial for the expanding scientific community interested in Neisseria research.

The number of musculoskeletal diseases has increased in recent years in Malaysia. However, the awareness and importance of ergonomics in Malaysia is still very low among the industries. Many ergonomics standards have been adopted by SIRIM Berhad under the purview of Department of Standards Malaysia (STANDARDS MALAYSIA). However, the take-up has been slow. Method: This paper examined the role of SIRIM Berhad in developing the standards, involvement at international levels and other government agencies in promoting Ergonomics. Ergonomics awareness seminars were arranged in three localities, representing three regions, not only to disseminate information on ergonomics and standards available but also to solicit inputs from stakeholders on the problems in developing and adoption of the standards. Results: Most of the stakeholders were not aware of the standards, do not know how to implement it, and do not have people who are knowledgeable in ergonomics. Since it is not mandatory, no conscious efforts were directed towards it. The lack of research in the various areas has also hindered the development of MS standards. Conclusion: Standards are important in determining at least the minimum requirement for safety, health and comfort of workers.

We evaluated the association between postural changes in blood pressure with beat-to-beat BPV during supine rest and standing. Continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure recordings were obtained from 832 individuals, aged 55 years and above, during ten minutes’ supine rest and three minutes’ standing. The maximal drop in systolic blood pressure (ΔSBP) and diastolic blood pressure (ΔDBP) with standing from the supine position, BPV in the supine and standing positions and standing to lying BPV ratio were computed. Standing systolic BPV and SLR for systolic BPV were correlated significantly with ΔSBP (r=0.497, p=&lt;0.001; r=0.476, p=&lt;0.001). Standing diastolic BPV and SLR of diastolic BPV showed a moderate correlation ΔDBP (r=0.397, p=&lt;0.001; r=0.432, p=&lt;0.001). Standing BPV and SLR for BPV were significantly higher for subjects with documented OH. Standing systolic BPV, height, weight and age were accounted 27% of the variability in ΔSBP while the SLR of diastolic BPV accounted for 19% of the variability in ΔDBP. The SLR for diastolic BPV, body weight, and cerebrovascular disease were independent predictors for OH (R2=0.157). The significance of beat-to-beat BPV remains unclear. Our study suggests that supine and erect BPV are influenced by different mechanisms. The impaired compensatory mechanism leading to OH, which are sympathetic hyporesponsiveness, are also associated with increased BPV while standing. ?

Cardiac image analysis data is crucial in biomedical modelling and simulation to predict and diagnose CVD. Despite the importance of cardiovascular image analysis (CVIA) software tools for prediction, diagnosis, and therapy of CVD, to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive review and a classification framework for the CVIA tools. In this paper, we review the literature related to the application of software tools for CVIA. In order to determine how image processing software tools are used for the CVIA diagnosis and prediction, this paper reviews the applications and features of these tools, through a survey of literature and the classification of articles, from January 2005 to December 2014. Keyword indices and article abstracts were used to identify 86 articles concerning image processing software tools for the CVIA. In this research, we review and classify 66 identified software tools for CVIA, with respect to the following four areas: (1) supported cardiovascular application, (2) cardiovascular imaging dimensionality, (3) cardiovascular imaging modality, and (4) post-processing ability. The results of our review and classification provide guidelines for utilization of CVIA software tool and future research on them. ?

The dependence on DSPs proved difficult to overcome. The European Union recommends avoidance of non-uniform biologicals in healthcare products (EU Tissue Directive No.2004/23/EU) by April 2007. However to-date most manufacturers of healthcare products have not fully complied with this directive. The pioneering research of this author in Australia led to development of synthetic human embryo culture media devoid of DSPs. A clinical trial was performed successfully [Ali, 1997, 2004; Ali et al., 2000] and patented in USA (US Patent 8415094)/PCT protected in Canada/ EU/ Australia/ Russia/ Israel/ worldwide and licensed to Cellcura ASA Norway (www.cellcura.com). The present communication reports development of synthetic spermatozoa cryopreservation medium (SCM). The nature of this intellectual property is proprietary. Patent application is pending. Therefore it shall not be described in detail here but events leading to its development will be presented. In the SCM the mean% +1SD spermatozoa motility pre- and post- freeze-thaw was similar 55.7+17.4 vs 54.9+13.3; n=10 (p>0.05). In previous studies after freezethaw using DSP-containing CM the pre and post-thaw spermatozoa motility was significantly different 45+11 Vs 23+12, p=0.047; n=64 that showed a loss of 22% in motility (p=0.047). A prospective study found SCM statistically similar to DSP containing-CM. Proof of principle was demonstrated following human pregnancy after generation of human embryos by intracytoplasmic spermatozoa injection (ICSI) using SCM frozen-thawed testicular spermatozoa. An efficacious SCM for human, possibly mammalian spermatozoa was formulated that may be regulation-compliant, and very safe. The availability of SCM eliminates batch variation and potential for disease transmission in routine spermatozoa cryopreservation in medicine, meat and dairy industries, and species conservation. ?

The aim is to assess the metabolism of the retina. Based on the fluorescence lifetime, different fluorescent compounds in the eye can be distinguished. Pathologic changes may be observed by detecting changes in the fluorescence lifetime. Until now, FLIO is performed using 30° fundus images. For certain diseases section of the fundus is of interest. In this work, observational clinical study in young healthy volunteers was performed to examine the usability of 55° wide-field fluorescence lifetime images. The time-resolved retina autofluorescence was measured (scanning laser ophthalmoscope: 55° of fundus, 62x62 μm? per pixel; excitation: diode laser with pico-second pulses, 473nm, 80MHz repetition rate; detection: spectral channels 498-560nm (ch1) and 560-720nm (ch2), time-correlated single photon counting method) in both eyes of 11 healthy volunteers (28.7±3.6 years). Three repetitive measurements on different days within one week at a similar time have been performed. All subjects had a crystalline lens and an undilated pupil. A modified 3- exponential approach was applied to determine the mean fluorescence lifetimes τm. τm were computed on the ETDRS grid and in a 15x15 pixel region 25° superior to the fovea. The Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to test for statistical significant differences between left and right eye. The coefficient of variation in the superior region is 5.6% (right) and 4.7% (left) in ch1 and 2.5% (right) and 2.1% (left) in ch2. No statistical significant differences have been found between right and left eye. FLIO measurements in young healthy volunteers using a 55° lens are repeatable in both eyes and show no significant differences.

Aphasic patients can lose their ability to obtain basic needs and healthcare services as they are unable to communicate. There is no electronic communication device or Voice Output Communication Aid (VOCA) that is made locally to help local stroke patients to communicate. Imported VOCA is extremely expensive and do not work in multi languages and dialects which usually are the native languages for local patients. Hence, there is a demand for such device to be designed. The design criteria and features of the device are decided based on literature review and surveys done. The device consists of 6 basic needs buttons, output voice messages such as eat, and drink, toilet, thank you, yes and no. It costs less than RM400, can be operated with minimum technical and reading skills and is portable. Additional features for this device included the option for any 3 languages, optional recordings of user’s family voice as the voice messages and a built in alarm for urgent use. The circuit of the device was tested to prevent over current, burn and reduce power consumption. The overall design of the prototype is good according to the healthcare professionals and patients’ evaluations. Minor improvements can be done in the future to bring the device into the market.

Sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) had been used as monotherapy against P. falciparum. Emergence of chloroquine resistance led to the shift in anti-malarial treatment policy in Yemen to artemisinin-based combination therapy, that is artesunate (AS) plus SP as first-line therapy for uncomplicated malaria and artemether-lumefantrine as second-line treatment. This study aimed to screen mutations in the dihydrofolate reductase (dhfr) and dihydropteroate synthetase (dhps) genes associated with SP resistance among P. falciparum population in Hadhramout governorate, Yemen. Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from dried blood spots of 137 P. falciparum isolates collected from a community-based study. DNA was amplified using nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequently sequenced for Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes. Sequences were analysed for mutations in Pfdhfr gene codons 51, 59, 108, and 164 and in Pfdhps gene codons 436, 437, and 540. Results: A total of 128 and 114 P. falciparum isolates were successfully sequenced for Pfdhfr and Pfdhps genes, respectively. Each Pfdhfr mutant allele (I 51 and N 108 ) in P. falciparum population had a frequency of 84 %. Pfdhfr R 59 mutant allele was detected in one isolate. Mutation at codon 437 (G 437 ) in the Pfdhps gene was detected in 44.7 % of falciparum malaria isolates. Frequencies of Pfdhfr double mutant genotype (I 51 C59 N 108 I164) and Pfdhfr/Pfdhps triple mutant genotype (I 51 C59 N 108I164-S436 G 437K540) were 82.8 and 39.3 %, respectively. One isolate harboured Pfdhfr triple mutant genotype (I 51, R 59, N 108, I164) and Pfdhfr/Pfdhps quadruple mutant genotype (I 51 R 59 N 108I164-S436 G 437K540). Conclusion: High frequencies of Pfdhfr and Pfdhps mutant alleles and genotypes in P. falciparum population in Hadhramout, Yemen, highlight the risk of developing resistance for SP, the partner drug of AS, which subsequently will expose the parasite to AS monotherapy increasing then the potential of the emergence of AS resistance. Study findings necessitate the continuous monitoring of the efficacy of the national anti-malarial drugs policy in Yemen. In addition, monitoring SP efficacy using molecular markers that has shown to be a practical and informative method for monitoring the partner drug of AS. ? 2015 Bamaga et al.",Hadhramout-Yemen; Molecular marker; Pfdhfr; Pfdhps; Plasmodium falciparum; Sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine resistance,"dihydrofolate reductase; dihydropteroate synthase; genomic DNA; protozoal DNA; protozoal protein; pyrimethamine plus sulfadoxine; antimalarial agent; dihydrofolate reductase; dihydropteroate synthase; drug combination; fanasil, pyrimethamine drug combination; mutant protein; protozoal DNA; pyrimethamine; sulfadoxine; antimalarial drug resistance; Article; codon; DNA extraction; dried blood spot testing; gene amplification; gene frequency; gene mutation; gene sequence; genetic association; genetic screening; genotype; nested polymerase chain reaction; nonhuman; parasite isolation; Pfdhfr gene; Pfdhps gene; Plasmodium falciparum; polymerase chain reaction; Yemen; adolescent; adult; aged; child; DNA sequence; drug combination; drug effects; drug resistance; epidemiology; female; genetics; human; infant; malaria falciparum; male; middle aged; newborn; parasitology; Plasmodium falciparum; preschool child; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antimalarials; Child; Child, Preschool; Dihydropteroate Synthase; DNA, Protozoan; Drug Combinations; Drug Resistance; Female; Gene Frequency; Genotype; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Malaria, Falciparum; Male; Middle Aged; Mutant Proteins; Plasmodium falciparum; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Pyrimethamine; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sulfadoxine; Tetrahydrofolate Dehydrogenase; Yemen; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84951774138

The only inclusion criterion is the presence of CKD stage 2 or higher as defined by the KDIGO guidelines. Demographic and clinical information are collected by a standardised electronic questionnaire, available in English and Chinese. The data are transferred to the CKDOD database either by e-mail or via web access. All data are checked for consistency and missing values. Collection of data started in September 2011 and by April 2015, data on 1323 individual patients had been submitted. The mean age at inclusion was 57 ± 14 years, 67 % were male and 36 % were diabetic. The baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate was 26 ml/min/1.73 m2. Of all enrolled patients, 324 (24 %) received ketoanalogue supplementation during at least one recorded visit. Discussion: The CKDOD is a very large and comprehensive data repository, currently focused in subjects recruited from Asia. The database is expected to provide important long-term information on CKD progression, nutritional and metabolic derangements that accompany CKD progression and treatment strategies to ameliorate progression and complications of CKD. ? 2015 Shah et al.",Chronic kidney disease; Clinical registry; Ketoanalogue supplementation,"adult; aged; Article; China; chronic kidney disease; cohort analysis; diabetes mellitus; diet supplementation; disease course; disease registry; estimated glomerular filtration rate; female; human; hypertension; India; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; observational study; prospective study; protein restriction; Thailand; adolescent; chronic kidney failure; clinical trial; complication; factual database; methodology; middle aged; multicenter study; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Databases, Factual; Disease Progression; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Research Design; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84951035763

With more and more mycobacterial genomes being sequenced, any knowledge generated from comparative genomic analysis would provide better insights into the biology, evolution, phylogeny and pathogenicity of this genus, thus helping in better management of diseases caused by Mycobacterium spp.With this motivation, we constructed MycoCAP, a new comparative analysis platform dedicated to the important genus Mycobacterium. This platform currently provides information of 2108 genome sequences of at least 55 Mycobacterium spp. A number of intuitive web-based tools have been integrated in MycoCAP particularly for comparative analysis including the PGC tool for comparison between two genomes, PathoProT for comparing the virulence genes among the Mycobacterium strains and the SuperClassification tool for the phylogenic classification of the Mycobacterium strains and a specialized classification system for strains of Mycobacterium abscessus. We hope the broad range of functions and easy-to-use tools provided in MycoCAP makes it an invaluable analysis platform to speed up the research discovery on mycobacteria for researchers.

Data came from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey (CLHLS) of 4 waves collected in 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011, filtered to include individuals aged 80 and above. Bivariate and logistic regression methods were used in analyses. There were significant differences in the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, chronic heart diseases, stroke/cardiovascular diseases, cancer and dementia, which generally saw an increase across the 4 waves. By contrast, prevalence of Parkinson was not significantly different over the 4 waves. Logistic regression results revealed that since 2002, hypertension had been significantly higher in subsequent waves in 2005, 2008 and 2011. Stroke had also shown significant increase in the 2008 and 2011 waves. Other chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Parkinson and dementia were only found to be significantly higher in the recent 2011 wave compared to the initial wave in 2002. Arthritis, which initially increased in earlier waves, had dropped significantly in the recent 2011 wave. However, respiratory conditions had been significantly lower since the initial wave in 2002. Generally, findings confirmed the increasing trend of chronic morbidity in recent years among the oldest-old in China. Long life expectancy coupled with chronic morbidity in very late age will duly have societal and economic implications. ? 2015 AIP Publishing LLC.",,,2-s2.0-84984539093

In order to investigate the genetic diversity of human Schistosoma species, a DNA barcoding study was conducted on S. mansoni and S. haematobium in Yemen. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted to collect urine and faecal samples from 400 children from five provinces in Yemen. The samples were examined for the presence of Schistosoma eggs. A partial fragment of the schistosome cox1 mitochondrial gene was analysed from each individual sample to evaluate the genetic diversity of the S. mansoni and S. haematobium infections. The data was also analysed together with previous published cox1 data for S. mansoni and S. haematobium from Africa and the Indian Ocean Islands. Results: Overall, 31.8 % of participants were found to be excreting schistosome eggs in either the urine or faeces (8.0 % S. mansoni and 22.5 % S. haematobium). Nineteen unique haplotypes of S. mansoni were detected and split into four lineages. Furthermore, nine unique haplotypes of S. haematobium were identified that could be split into two distinct groups. Conclusion: This study provides novel and interesting insights into the population diversity and structure of S. mansoni and S. haematobium in Yemen. The data adds to our understanding of the evolutionary history and phylogeography of these devastating parasites whilst the genetic information could support the control and monitoring of urogenital and intestinal schistosomiasis in these endemic areas. ? 2015 Sady et al.",DNA barcoding; Evolution; Genetic diversity; Molecular epidemiology; Neglected tropical diseases; Schistosoma haematobium; Schistosoma mansoni; Yemen,"Article; child; cross-sectional study; DNA barcoding; feces analysis; genetic variability; haplotype; human; major clinical study; molecular evolution; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; Schistosoma hematobium; Schistosoma mansoni; urinalysis; worm egg; Yemen; adolescent; Africa; animal; cohort analysis; feces; genetic variation; genetics; Indian Ocean; neglected disease; parasitology; phylogeography; population genetics; prevalence; Schistosoma haematobium; Schistosoma mansoni; schistosomiasis haematobia; schistosomiasis mansoni; Adolescent; Africa; Animals; Child; Cohort Studies; Cross-Sectional Studies; DNA Barcoding, Taxonomic; Feces; Genetic Variation; Genetics, Population; Haplotypes; Humans; Indian Ocean Islands; Neglected Diseases; Phylogeography; Prevalence; Schistosoma haematobium; Schistosoma mansoni; Schistosomiasis haematobia; Schistosomiasis mansoni; Yemen",2-s2.0-85016923805

The weights and bias of the NN was trained using the CS to deviate from being stuck in local minima. The high dimension of the features in our dataset triggered the study to extract the critical features using principal component analysis. The extracted features were used to built a classifier based on the NN and the CS for classifying potential diabetes patients. The propose diabetes classifier performance was compared to the classifiers built based on artificial bee colony and genetic algorithm. Simulation results show that the proposed approach converges faster to the optimum solution than the comparative classifiers. Comparative study of the approach proposed and previous methods, further proved the effectiveness of our method.

There are three types of envelope proteins each exhibiting distinct structure folds. Although the exact fusion mechanism remains elusive, it was suggested that the three classes of viral fusion proteins share a similar mechanism of membrane fusion. The common mechanism of action makes it possible to correlate the properties of self-derived peptide inhibitors with their activities. Here we developed a support vector machine model using sequence-based statistical scores of self-derived peptide inhibitors as input features to correlate with their activities. The model displayed 92% prediction accuracy with the Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.84, obviously superior to those using physicochemical properties and amino acid decomposition as input. The predictive support vector machine model for self- derived peptides of envelope proteins would be useful in development of antiviral peptide inhibitors targeting the virus fusion process. ? 2015 Xu et al.

We present the pitfalls of evaluating a rare cause of adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing's syndrome in the transition period between adolescence and adulthood. Case presentation: A sibling pair with familial isolated primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease is described. The index case, a 20-year-old Chinese woman, presented with premenopausal osteoporosis with T12 compression fracture and young hypertension. Biochemical analysis confirmed adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing's syndrome (elevated 0800 h plasma cortisol 808 nmol/L with suppressed adrenocorticotropic hormone level <5 pg/ml). Computed tomography of her adrenal glands revealed a 0.7-cm left adrenal hypodense nodule. After a left adrenalectomy, she had residual hypercortisolism (progressive weight gain, new T10 compression fracture, and not glucocorticoid-dependent postoperatively). Completion of contralateral adrenalectomy was performed upon recognition of typical histologic characteristics of primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease found in an initial left adrenalectomy specimen. Similarly, her younger brother developed adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing's syndrome at age 18 years, with typical cushingoid habitus, but no osteoporosis or hypertension. His adrenal computed tomographic scans showed micronodularities over bilateral adrenal glands. He was successfully treated with bilateral adrenalectomy. Screening for Carney's complex and PRKAR1A gene mutation was negative. Signs and symptoms of Cushing's syndrome resolved after bilateral adrenalectomy for both patients. They were placed on lifelong glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement therapy and long-term surveillance for Carney's complex. Conclusions: The cases of these two patients illustrate the difficulties involved in diagnosing primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease, a variant of adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing's syndrome that is managed with bilateral adrenalectomy. A high index of suspicion for this disease is needed, especially in adolescents with adrenocorticotropic hormone-independent Cushing's syndrome who have a significant family history, features of Carney's complex, and no resolution of Cushing's syndrome after unilateral adrenalectomy. Patients with primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease can either have bilateral/multiple adrenal nodules or normal adrenal glands visualized by computed tomography. Long-term surveillance is imperative in patients with confirmed Carney's complex and in those who have not undergone complete genetic testing to exclude this hereditary disorder. ? 2015 Lim et al.",ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome; Carney's complex (CNC); Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD); PRKAR1A gene,"corticotropin; ketoconazole; spironolactone; testosterone; corticotropin; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit Ialpha; PRKAR1A protein, human; acanthosis nigricans; adrenalectomy; adult; Article; backache; bone densitometry; bone density; Carney complex; case report; Chinese; clinical feature; compression fracture; computer assisted tomography; Cushing syndrome; dexamethasone suppression test; DNA sequence; edema; female; fragility fracture; gene; gene mutation; hormone blood level; hormone substitution; human; hydrocortisone release; hypercortisolism; hypertension; moon face; myopathy; obesity; oligomenorrhea; osteoporosis; physical examination; priority journal; PRKAR1A gene; short stature; sibling; stria; testosterone blood level; weight gain; adolescent; adrenal gland; blood; Cushing syndrome; genetics; male; pathology; pedigree; x-ray computed tomography; young adult; Adolescent; Adrenal Glands; Adrenalectomy; Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; Cushing Syndrome; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinase RIalpha Subunit; Female; Humans; Male; Pedigree; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84952862858

In May 2013, there was a wild poliomyelitis outbreak in that area, as reported by the World Health Organization. Laboratory investigation, including cerebrospinal fluid, was unremarkable, and electrophysiological studies showed active axonal denervation in the left lower limb. The whole spine T2-weighted MRI revealed non-enhancing hyperintensities of the bilateral anterior horn cells, predominantly on the left side at T11-12.

The Physician–Pharmacist Collaborative Index (PPCI) was developed to assess the professional exchanges between doctors and pharmacists. Two versions of the PPCI was developed: one for physicians and one for pharmacists. However, these instruments have not been validated in Malaysia. Objective To determine the validity and reliability of the PPCI for physicians in Malaysia. Setting An urban tertiary hospital in Malaysia. Methods This prospective study was conducted from June to August 2014. Doctors were grouped as either a “collaborator” or a “non-collaborator”. Collaborators were doctors who regularly worked with one particular clinical pharmacist in their ward, while non-collaborators were doctors who interacted with any random pharmacist who answered the general pharmacy telephone line whenever they required assistance on medication-related enquiries, as they did not have a clinical pharmacist in their ward. Collaborators were firstly identified by the clinical pharmacist he/she worked with, then invited to participate in this study through email, as it was difficult to locate and approach them personally. Non-collaborators were sampled conveniently by approaching them in person as these doctors could be easily sampled from any wards without a clinical pharmacist. The PPCI for physicians was administered at baseline and 2?weeks later. Main outcome measure Validity (face validity, factor analysis and discriminative validity) and reliability (internal consistency and test–retest) of the PPCI for physicians. Results A total of 116 doctors (18 collaborators and 98 non-collaborators) were recruited. Confirmatory factor analysis confirmed that the PPCI for physicians was a 3-factor model. The correlation of the mean domain scores ranged from 0.711 to 0.787. “Collaborators” had significantly higher scores compared to “non-collaborators” (81.4?±?10.1 vs. 69.3?±?12.1, p?<?0.001). The Cronbach alpha for the overall PPCI for physicians was 0.949, while the Cronbach alpha values for the individual domains ranged from 0.877 to 0.926. Kappa values at test–retest ranged from 0.553 to 0.752. Conclusion The PPCI for physicians was a valid and reliable measure in determining doctors’ views about collaborative working relationship with pharmacists, in Malaysia. ? 2015, Koninklijke Nederlandse Maatschappij ter bevordering der Pharmacie.",Collaboration; Hospitals; Interprofessional relations; Malaysia; Pharmacists; Physicians,"adult; Article; attitude assessment; controlled study; discriminant validity; face validity; factorial analysis; female; human; internal consistency; Malaysia; male; pharmacist attitude; physician attitude; Physician Pharmacist Collaborative Index; priority journal; prospective study; reliability; tertiary care center; test retest reliability; trust; validation process; cooperation; health personnel attitude; hospital personnel; interpersonal communication; middle aged; pharmacist; physician; public relations; questionnaire; reproducibility; standards; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Communication; Cooperative Behavior; Female; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Personnel, Hospital; Pharmacists; Physicians; Prospective Studies; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Tertiary Care Centers",2-s2.0-84944749389

Such elderly people have little chances to communicate with other people and are likely to be socially isolated. The monitoring system is one of possible solutions to confirm the safety of elderly people. Sensor network or portable sensing devices can be applied to such monitoring systems. However, basically, such systems are unilateral systems to just observe human states. It is important for elderly people and their families to create opportunities for communicating with each other. Visualization based on lifelogging is one of the important and effective techniques implored to understand and share personal preference and lifestyle. If the elderly's family members can share their hobbies, diversions and lifestyle, then they can easily select common topics to discuss and ensue communication. In this study, we develop a visualization system to represent personal relation between elderly people and their family members based on their daily activities. Moreover, this paper proposes a method of topological visualization based on the spring-mass-damper system (Spring Model). ? 2015 IEEE.",elderly health care; lifelogging; spring model; visualization,Flow visualization; Health care; Information science; Sensor networks; Topology; Visualization; Lifelogging; Monitoring system; Personal preferences; Personal relations; Spring model; Spring-mass-damper system; Topological visualization; Visualization system; Monitoring,2-s2.0-84961779013

In this paper, we present simulations from an actively-contracting truncated ellipsoid LV model, incorporating realistic fiber orientation and electromechanical properties, to investigate the effects of infarct size and transmural extent (TME) on myofiber regional mechanics. Results showed that transmural infarcts greatly elevated both the myofiber stress and strain at the border zone during end systole, making the LV more susceptible to structural remodeling. It was found that TME rather than infarct size was more predictive of LV remodeling. ? 2015 IEEE.",,"heart infarction; heart left ventricle function; heart ventricle; heart ventricle remodeling; human; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Myocardial Infarction; Ventricular Function, Left; Ventricular Remodeling",2-s2.0-84953279124

In this observational, cross-sectional study, measurements for central macular thickness (CMT), average macular thickness (AMT) and macular volume (MV) were obtained using OCT in 165 eyes of 165 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The level of HbA1c, age, visual acuity and duration of diabetes were taken and compared to the macular measurements. The mean age of the patients was 61.26?years. The duration of DM and level of HbA1c was 12.95?years and 8.10?%, respectively. HbA1c showed a modest, positive correlation with AMT (r = 0.304, p < 0.05) and MV (r = 0.349, p < 0.05) but was poorly correlated with CMT (r = 0.160, p < 0.05). Age was inversely correlated with AMT (r = ?0.227, p < 0.05) and MV (r = ?0.275, p < 0.05). No correlation was found between the duration of DM and all macular measurements. Near visual acuity had a slightly higher correlation with macular thickness and volume compared to far visual acuity, although the correlation strength was weak. HbA1c, age and near visual acuity are moderately correlated with AMT and MV. Among these, MV had the strongest correlation with HbA1c. Our results suggest that HbA1c may be used as an early predictor of OCT-derived macular volume changes and thus plays an important role in the early identification and manifestation of diabetic macular oedema. ? 2015, Research Society for Study of Diabetes in India.",Glycosylated haemoglobin; Macular; Optical coherence tomography; Type 2 diabetes mellitus,,2-s2.0-84953304709

The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence, aetiology and risk factors for mortality among adult patients aged 18 years and above with psoriasis in Malaysia. Methods: This was a retrospective study involving adult patients notified by dermatologists to the Malaysian Psoriasis Registry between July 2007 and December 2013. Data were cross-checked against the National Death Registry. Patients certified dead were identified and the cause of death was analysed. Multivariate analysis using multiple logistic regression were conducted on potential factors associated with higher risk of mortality. Results: A total of 419 deaths were identified among the 9775 patients notified. There were four significant risk factors for higher mortality: age>40 years (age 41-60 years old, Odds Ratio (OR) 2.70, 95%CI 1.75, 4.18; age>60 years OR 7.46, 95%CI 4.62, 12.02), male gender (OR 1.72, 95%CI 1.33,2.22), severe psoriasis with body surface area (BSA) >10% (OR 1.52, 95%CI 1.19, 1.96) and presence of at least one cardiovascular co-morbidity (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.30, 2.14). Among the 301 patients with verifiable causes of death, the leading causes were infection (33.9%), cardiovascular disease (33.6%) and malignancy (15.9%). Conclusion: Infection was the leading cause of death among psoriasis patients in Malaysia.

In this study, we show Syzygium aqueum leaf extract to protective activity against free radicals as well as having low pro-oxidant capability. Recent attention has been focused on plant extracts and plant derived compounds to treat type 2 diabetes. Plants that serve both as antioxidant scavengers as well as antidiabetic agents would be ideal to treat diabetes and its complications. Our investigations revealed the effectiveness of Syzygium aqueum leaf extract in inhibiting the carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes, α-glucosidase and α-amylase at more significant levels than the commercial drug acarbose. In addition, the extract was able to inhibit the key enzyme in the polyol pathway, aldose reductase and prevent the AGE formation. It is also highly desirable to find natural antidiabetic alternatives that stimulate adipogenesis and glucose uptake in adipocytes but, unlike TZDs, do not induce obesity or other side effects. We found that non-toxic concentrations of the extract was able to induce differentiation in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, enhance glucose uptake in mature adipocytes and was able to increase adiponectin secretion. Sub-acute toxicity studies using Sprague Dawley rats showed no toxicity effects of the extract up to concentrations of 2000 mg/kg. The structural characterization of the active compound(s) in plant extracts could thus lead to the formulation of new therapeutic drug to treat diabetes mellitus.

The aim was to (a) perform a cross-cultural adaptation and (b) prove that the Malay CARIFS is a reliable tool. Findings: The CARIFS underwent forward and backward translations as recommended by international guidelines. A pilot study was performed on the harmonised version and the final version of the Malay version of CARIFS was produced. A test-retest, 1h apart, was then performed on parents with children less than 13years old, admitted with a respiratory tract infection. Parents of children with asthma and who were not eloquent in Malay, were excluded. The data was analysed for consistency (Cronbach's alpha) and reliability (test-retest co-efficient). Thirty-three parents were recruited. Children were aged median (IQR) 6 (2.8, 13.3) months with a male: female ratio of 22:11 and 88% were Malays. Parents were interviewed at median (IQR) 6 (3, 11.5) days of admission. The Cronbach's aα coefficient was 0.70 for all items. The test-retest reliability analysis had a minimum and maximum intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.63 and 0.97 respectively. Clinically, the longer patients were admitted, the lower the severity score (r = -0.35, p < 0.05), indicating that they were getting better. Conclusion: The Malay version of CARIFS is a valid and reliable tool to determine severityof respiratory illness in children.

Compared to the non-carotid sinus hypersensitivity control group, the carotid sinus syndrome group had significantly higher early H:M (estimated mean difference, B = 0.40; 95% confidence interval, CI = 0.13 to 0.67, p = 0.005) and late H:M (B = 0.32; 95%CI = 0.03 to 0.62, p = 0.032). There was, however, no significant difference in early H:M (p = 0.326) or late H:M (p = 0.351) between the asymptomatic carotid sinus hypersensitivity group and non- carotid sinus hypersensitivity controls. Conclusions: Cardiac sympathetic neuronal activity is increased relative to age-matched controls in individuals with carotid sinus syndrome but not those with asymptomatic carotid sinus hypersensitivity. Blood pressure and heart rate measurements alone may therefore represent an over simplification in the assessment for carotid sinus syndrome and the relative increase in cardiac sympathetic innervation provides additional clues to understanding the mechanisms behind the symptomatic presentation of carotid sinus hypersensitivity. ? 2015 Tan et al.",,"(3 iodobenzyl)guanidine i 123; (3 iodobenzyl)guanidine; radioactive iodine; adult; aged; Article; asymptomatic disease; blood pressure measurement; cardiac imaging; cardiovascular parameters; carotid sinus hypersensitivity; carotid sinus syndrome; case control study; clinical article; cohort analysis; community living; controlled study; delayed diagnosis; disease association; drug uptake; early diagnosis; faintness; falling; female; heart disease; heart rate; heart scintiscanning; heart to mediastinal uptake ratio; human; male; sympathetic innervation; carotid sinus; diagnostic imaging; heart; hypersensitivity; mediastinum; metabolism; middle aged; multivariate analysis; pathology; regression analysis; scintiscanning; very elderly; 3-Iodobenzylguanidine; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carotid Sinus; Case-Control Studies; Female; Heart; Humans; Hypersensitivity; Iodine Radioisotopes; Male; Mediastinum; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Radionuclide Imaging; Regression Analysis",2-s2.0-84936817490

Mosques are the main gateways into the Muslim community. Hence, it is imperative to explore their role in facilitating organ donation. Material/Methods: A self-administered survey was conducted between October and December 2013. We distributed 700 pilottested questionnaires to 82 mosques in Kuala Lumpur and its suburbs. The respondents were stratified into 2 groups: the mosque committees and the Muslim Jama’ah (individuals who come regularly to mosque for prayer). Results: Data collected from a survey on 653 Malaysian Muslims reveals that the main factors that hamper organ donation-related activities at the mosques in Malaysia are the lack of experts and financial resources. The level of autonomy of the mosque is also another main issue. The respondents believe that talks and dialogues are the best methods for organ donation campaigns at the mosques. Conclusions: We argue that if the mosques are to play a role in imparting knowledge on organ donation, there should be ample opportunity for the mosque committee to choose the content of religious talks held in their community. The mosques in Malaysia are not sufficiently facilitated to channel the information on organ donation to the Muslim community. Providing financial support and expert campaigners are expected to increase organ donation-related activities at the mosques and subsequently could increase awareness regarding organ donations among Malaysian Muslims. ?

These are not that popular in Southeast Asian countries due to costs and technology considerations. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the suitability of the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) IV model in a single centre Malaysian ICU.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A prospective study was conducted at the single centre ICU in Hospital Sultanah Aminah (HSA) Malaysia. External validation of APACHE IV involved a cohort of 916 patients who were admitted in 2009. Model performance was assessed through its calibration and discrimination abilities. A first-level customisation using logistic regression approach was also applied to improve model calibration.RESULTS: APACHE IV exhibited good discrimination, with an area under receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.78. However, the model's overall fit was observed to be poor, as indicated by the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test (? = 113, P <0.001). Predicted in-ICU mortality rate (28.1%) was significantly higher than the actual in-ICU mortality rate (18.8%). Model calibration was improved after applying first-level customisation (? = 6.39, P = 0.78) although discrimination was not affected.CONCLUSION: APACHE IV is not suitable for application in HSA ICU, without further customisation. The model's lack of fit in the Malaysian study is attributed to differences in the baseline characteristics between HSA ICU and APACHE IV datasets. Other possible factors could be due to differences in clinical practice, quality and services of health care systems between Malaysia and the United States.",,"adult; APACHE; female; hospital mortality; human; intensive care unit; Malaysia; male; middle aged; prognosis; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; severity of illness index; tertiary care center; theoretical model; validation study; Adult; APACHE; Female; Hospital Mortality; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Malaysia; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; ROC Curve; Severity of Illness Index; Tertiary Care Centers",2-s2.0-85018225391

Methods: Based on data collected from 80 living kidney donors, the relationship between QoL and the frequency of follow-up visits was examined. QoL was measured using standard SF-8 questions to capture its different dimensions. Results: Donors in the 1991–1998 donation cohort have low QoL, especially in the domains of physical and vitality, compared with the other two cohorts (1999–2005 and 2006–2012). The mean scores showed that donors who never went for any follow-up activities visits experience low QoL in most of the categories, particularly those related to physical activities, implying the importance of follow-up activities visits in influencing the donors’ QoL. Lower QoL was recorded for respondents that never received post-transplant treatment. Conclusion: Although this study found no serious post-transplant QoL issues in Malaysia, it is still important to set up a donor registry and provide free and mandatory follow-up visits for all donors in order to adequately monitor their health. ? 2015, Journal of University Malaya Medical Centre.

The first gastroscope was a rigid scope first introduced by Adolf Kussmaul in 1868. However this scope suffered from the 2 drawbacks of poor illumination and high risk of instrumental perforation. Rudolf Schindler improved on this by inventing the semiflexible gastroscope in 1932. But it was Basil Hirschowitz, using the principle of light conduction in fibreoptics, who allowed us to ""see well"" for the first time when he invented the flexible gastroscopy in 1958. With amazing speed and innovation, instrument companies, chiefly Japanese, had improved on the Hirschowitz gastroscope and invented a flexible colonoscope. Walter McCune introduced the technique of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) in 1968 which has now evolved into a sophisticated procedure.

Fusing confocal and light microscopy with endoscopy has allowed us to perform an ""optical biopsy"" of the GI mucosa.

With increasing obesity, fat mass will increase at a greater rate than lean body weight. As a result, an obese patient will have greater fat mass but only slightly more muscle mass than a normal weight individual of the same height and sex. Due to these differences, drug kinetics and dynamics are altered in the obese. Drug administration practices need to be altered to accommodate recommended doses based on studies done in normal weight subjects. These adjustments are done using different weight descriptors such as total body weight (TBW), lean body mass (LBM) or ideal body weight (IBW). Choice of weight descriptor to guide dosing depends on the lipophilic or hydrophilic property of the drugs. Generally, hydrophilic drugs will primarily redistribute to the muscle compartment, thus the loading dose of these drugs should be based on LBM. Likewise, lipophilic drugs will eventually redistribute to the fat mass, thus loading dose of these drugs should be based on TBW. However, other factors such as protein binding, tissue binding and degree of ionization also greatly influence how drugs distribute in the different tissue compartments. As a result of this complex interaction, drug dosing should ultimately be based on the available evidence for that particular drug. Factors such as metabolism, clearance and pharmacodynamic idiosyncrasies must be taken into consideration for any individual. The titration of a drug aided by drug level monitoring or monitoring of response to the drug may be good practice. This is especially so when using drugs with a narrow therapeutic window, and in obese patients with possible life threatening complications of obesity such as obstructive sleep apnea. ?

Our body produces hormones from different glands and these hormones are kept in balance by various regulatory feedback mechanisms. Autoimmune problems, tumors, metabolic dysregulation and genetic predisposition may disrupt normal regulation of hormones causing excessive production, hormone deficiency or resistance of target organs to hormones. Three hormones, i.e., thyroid hormones, insulin and glucocorticoids are at issue more often compared to the rest of the hormones in the endocrine system. In hyperthyroidism, various antithyroid drugs are used, which target the different stages in thyroid hormone synthesis and release. In hypothyroidism, thyroxine is used in replacement therapy. Diabetes mellitus is an increasing problem worldwide where high blood glucose level is attributed to the deficiency of insulin (Type 1 diabetes) or insulin resistance (Type 2 diabetes.) Type 1 diabetes is managed with human insulin or insulin analogues. In Type 2 diabetes, where there is insulin resistance and relative insulin deficiency, insulin secretagogues and insulin sensitizers are used. Newer agents target the incretin hormones which play an important role in the regulation of insulin, glucose and satiety. The adrenal glands which produce the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids regulate many metabolic processes and are important in inflammatory and immune responses. Synthetic glucocorticoids are used clinically in a wide variety of clinical conditions not related to hormone deficiencies due to its potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects. However, the use of glucocorticoids therapeutically is associated with many adverse effects, among them impaired response to infection and Cushings syndrome. ?

At present, there is a lack of systematic empirical analyses on factors that determine the ART coverage. Therefore, the current study aimed to identify the determinants of the ART coverage in 41 countries in Sub- Saharan Africa. It employed statistical analyses for this purpose. Four elements, namely, the HIV prevalence, the level of national income, the level of medical expenditure and the number of nurses, were hypothesised to determine the ART coverage. The findings revealed that among the four proposed determinants only the HIV prevalence had a statistically significant impact on the ART coverage.

In many patients with chest pain, no or mild CAD (< 50% stenosis) is found. It is uncertain whether this 'non-significant' result influences management and outcomes. We reviewed characteristics and outcomes in a contemporary cohort of chest pain referrals who had mild or absent CAD on coronary angiography. Method All patients undergoing coronary angiography at Auckland City Hospital during July 2010-October 2011 were reviewed (n = 2983). Of these, 12.3% (n = 366) underwent coronary angiography for evaluation of chest pain and were found to have absent or mild CAD. These patients were followed up for 2.3 ± 0.6 years. Results Mean age was 60.0 ± 12.3 years, 56.1% were female. The ECG was abnormal in 55.0% of patients. Stress testing for inducible ischaemia was undertaken in 40.7% of patients and was abnormal in 57.7%. Following angiography, 43.2% had no changes to cardiac medications. Additional drug therapy (aspirin, statin, beta-blockers, ACE-inhibitor) was commenced in around 14.2-22.1% of cases. These drugs were discontinued in 4.1-8.2% of patients. Rates of major adverse cardiovascular events and readmissions with chest pain were 0.3% (1) and 1.9% (7) respectively at 30 days, and 1.9% (7) and 6.0% (22) at 1 year.

First, earlier studies on the transmission of the disease since its discovery by Dr. R. Robles in 1915 are outlined. Second, eleven blackfly species caught on humans are evaluated for vector status on the basis of their natural and experimental infections with third-stage larvae of Onchocerca volvulus, and Simulium ochraceum,* S. metallicum* and S. callidum are confirmed as natural vectors of the disease in Guatemala in descending order of importance, whereas S. gonzalezi, S. haematopotum, S. veracruzanum and S. horacioi are potential vectors. Third, the migration and fate of O. volvulus microfilariae ingested by female blackflies are highlighted on the basis of the findings of the cibarial armature of S. ochraceum and physiological incompatibility of S. metallicum as main barriers against microfilariae, both of which greatly decrease the number of ingested O. volvulus microfilariae developing to the third-stage larvae per female. Fourth, among many ecological factors of female blackfly populations, geographical and altitudinal distributions, habits of blood feeding, host preferences for blood feeding, preference for human body parts, parous rates, daily and seasonal fluctuations of biting activities, in particular, of parous females, gonotrophic cycle, longevity, flight range, and annual transmission potential are reviewed, and their influences on the transmission dynamics of the disease agents are considered. Fifth, effects of air temperatures on the O. volvulus–S. ochraceum complex are examined, with a special reference to the characteristic altitudinal distributions of the disease. The importance of reliable identification of both the vector blackfly species and filarial larvae found in female blackflies is emphasized to understand the transmission of the disease. ? 2015 by The Japanese Society of Tropical Medicine.",,air temperature; disease transmission; ecology; flight; geographic distribution; Guatemala; human; insect bite; life cycle; longevity; microfilaria (nematode larva); nonhuman; Onchocerca volvulus; onchocerciasis; Review; sanguivore; seasonal variation; Simuliidae,2-s2.0-84947445373

We present a particularly challenging case of tracheal bronchus combined with tracheal stenosis that had remained asymptomatic until it was diagnosed incidentally. Objective: To describe our findings in a 66-year-old lady who presented for an elective resection of lung tumour. Methods: The medical and surgical records plus biomedical images were reviewed together with a literature search on the subject. Results: We describe a patient found to have tracheal stenosis with a large tracheal bronchus during right lower lobectomy. Attempts to isolate and collapse the right lung failed with both double lumen tube (DLT) and bronchial blocker. A CT Scan done preoperatively showed a right upper lobe bronchus originating high in the trachea and interestingly a reconstructed three dimensional (3-D) image later, revealed an unusually large tracheal bronchus with a stenotic remnant of the trachea before the true carina begins. Conclusion: There are many anatomical variations of tracheal bronchus but none so far describes an entirely asymptomatic anomaly with concurrent tracheal stenosis. Specific CT imaging to reconstruct tracheobronchial anomalies in a 3-D view is suggested whenever the diagnosis is detected during staging CT.

The working mechanism of the device is based on intensity modulation technique where the transmitted light intensity variation is measured when the probe is immersed into dengue NS1 antigen and antibody solution with various concentrations. The dengue NS1 antigen and antibody of various concentrations (1x10-2, 1x10-3, 1x10-4, 1x10-5, 1x10-6, 1x10-7, 1x10-8 mg/mL) were prepared by serial dilution of a stock concentration of 1mg/ml with phosphate buffer saline solution. The tapered POF is fabricated through a chemical etching method by using acetone and deionized water to achieve a waist diameter and length of 0.45 mm and 25 mm, respectively. For detection of dengue NS1 antigen, as the solution concentration varies from 1x10-8 mg/mL to 1x10-2 mg/mL, the output voltage of the sensor reduces linearly from 1.21 mV to 1.17 mV with a slope sensitivity of 0.004 mV/ (mg/mL) and a linearity of 92.61%. As for detection of dengue NS1 antibody, the tapered POF based sensor produces a sensitivity of 0.84 mV/ (mg/mL) with a linearity of 98.61%. ? 2015, National Institute of Optoelectronics.

Since the life expectancy at a particular age tends to increase over time for male and female, the mortality risk tends to be smaller over time. Therefore it is expected that pensioners tend to live longer and thereby cause increase in pension liabilities to the government. Countries are looking for solutions to decrease the effect of increased longevity on pension costs. The most common changes are to equalize the retirement age for male and female and to rise the retirement age. Therefore, we studied the longevity factor for the government pensioner in Malaysia at age 55, 56, 57, 58, 59 and 60 years respectively. Since the pensions are paid for the rest of the pensioner’s life in the event of his death and also to his spouse and child if any in the form of a derivative pension, the longevity factor for pensioner, spouse and child will be formulated and estimated separately. To formulate and estimate these factors, the theory of annuities and the Pension Law of Malaysia need to be studied. ? 2015, Universiti Malaysia Sarawak, All Rights Reserved.",Annuities; Derivative Pension; Life Expectancy; Longevity Factor; Mortality Risk; Pension Liabilities,,2-s2.0-84945259226

There are no reports to date from the South Asia and South East Asia region. We report a Malaysian tertiary centre case series of children with haemato-oncological disease who developed PRES. Methods: Retrospective study of children seen with haemato-oncology diseases seen at the University Malaya Medical Centre Kuala Lumpur who developed PRES from 2011 – 2013. Clinical details were obtained from medical records and brain neuroimaging was reviewed. Results: Five patients met the inclusion criteria. All 5 patients had significant hypertension acutely or subacutely prior to neurology presentation. Four presented with acute seizures and the remainder 1 presented with encephalopathy.Three patients were on chemotherapy, 1 had renal impairment and 1 had prior immunosupression for bone marrow transplantation. A full recovery was seen in 4 patients and 1 patient had mild residual quadriplegia. Conclusion: Our case series expands the clinico-radiological spectrum of PRES in children with underlying haemato-oncological disorders. It is the first to show that prior cyclosporin intake as long as 2 months is a potential risk factor for PRES. Clinicians need to be vigilant for development of PRES and closely monitor the blood pressure in these children who are receiving or recently had immunosuppressive drugs and present with acute neurological symptoms. ? 2015, ASEAN Neurological Association.

The co-crystal structure of mt-DHFR bound with glycerol (GOL), NAPDH and methotrexate (MTX) reveals a GOL binding site on the enzyme. This GOL binding site could be very important for the design of novel, selective mt-DHFR inhibitors, because this binding site is absent on human DHFR (h-DHFR). We have performed molecular dynamic simulations and free energy calculations to evaluate the binding affinity of GOL and its free energy contribution to the binding of MTX to mt-DHFR. The results showed that GOL does not bind tightly to mt-DHFR. Although GOL itself contributed free energy on MTX binding to mt-DHFR, GOL also increased the flexibilities of MTX, so that MTX cannot maintain strong electronic interactions with ARG32 and ARG60, which caused the total binding free energy to decrease. These data suggest that GOL binding is weak and it could be expelled from the binding site, to allow inhibitors containing appropriate side chains to bind. This observation can be used to inform future drug design studies, especially those aimed at improving drug selectivity against h-DHFR. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.",free energy calculation; molecular modelling; Mycobacterium tuberculosis dihydrofolate reductase,Crystal structure; Enzyme activity; Enzymes; Free energy; Glycerol; Molecular dynamics; Molecular modeling; Binding free energy; Cocrystal structure; Dihydrofolate reductase; Electronic interactions; Energy contribution; Free-energy calculations; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Potential drug targets; Binding energy,2-s2.0-84942191855

These filters are defined by their particular orders (e.g. first-, second- or third-order) and the frequency they passed through. Although, EMG signals from human skeletal muscles are important to realize the muscle features, but there is no consistency found in the literature regarding the influence of different orders of the filter and cutoff frequency when processing and filtering EMG signal during lower limb (Biceps Femoris) muscle contraction. It is therefore important to know the response of muscle EMG signal after changing the order of filters and cut-off frequencies. Thus, this paper addresses the behavior of the signal patterns after varying the filter order and cut-off frequency of the filter. To record the EMG signal, one healthy male participated in this study after obtaining his informed consent and the electrodes were placed on the lower limb Biceps Femoris muscle during sit-to-stand task at a normal speed. During the signal processing, the cut-off frequency of the filter was fixed with the variation of the order of the filter. Later, the order of the filter was fixed while the cut-off frequency was varied.

Ten obese adults, six males and four females, and ten lean adults, six males and four females, volunteered for the study. The results showed that the obese people are able to reduce the knee joint flexion moment when climbing stair compared to the normal slim people. In the frontal plane, no significant differences were found in the knee adduction moment. Moreover, obese individuals have identified some kinematics adaptations including slower velocity and longer stance phase, compared to slim individuals. The obese individuals might adjust their gait characteristics in response to their heavy bodies to reduce or maintain the same load on the knee joint as slim individuals. ? 2015 National Taiwan University.",Kinematic parameters; Kinetic parameters; Obese; Regular stair walking; Stride events,Joints (anatomy); Kinematics; Physiological models; Force plate; Frontal planes; Knee adduction moment; Knee joint; Knee joint flexion; Lower extremity; Stair-climbing; Three-dimensional motion analysis; Stairs; abduction; adduction; adult; ankle; Article; biomechanics; body mass; climbing; clinical article; controlled study; female; gait; hip; human; kinematics; kinetic parameters; kinetics; knee function; lean body weight; leg movement; male; obesity; standing,2-s2.0-84939572464

The fatality rate is very high compared to other viral diseases. Inadequate vaccination, lack of awareness, cost of medications and ineffective post-prophylactic surveillance are some of the major reasons for the high prevalence of rabies in tropical regions, leading to more than 40,000 cases annually presenting a major threat to public health. The present report aims to provide an overview of the lethal effects of rabies in major regions of the tropics, such as China and its neighboring countries, India, Bangkok, Thailand, all major regions of Africa, such as Tanzania and Ethiopia, and tropical regions of South America. The review is based on rich literature sources including epidemiological and endemic surveys, sample analysis, and health and hygiene reports from various parts of the world. The epidemiology is elucidated in the present article. The review also highlights the incidence of cases and aspects of prophylaxis. A bird's-eye view of rabies and its epidemic impact will encourage researchers to act further on the disease, which will lead to better awareness and treatment options. ? 2015 Taylor & Francis.",epidemiology; prophylaxis; public health; rabies; tropical region,Aves,2-s2.0-84938994811

Methods: A nationwide postal survey involving all Malaysian dental therapists who met the inclusion criteria (n = 1726). Results: The response rate was 76.8%. All respondents were females; mean age 35.4 years (SD = 8.4). Majority were married (85.5%) and more than one-half had a working experience of <10 years (56.1%). Majority worked in community dental service (94.3%) and in urban areas (61.7%). Overall, they were highly satisfied with most aspects of their career. However, they were least satisfied with administrative workload (58.1%), career advancement opportunities (51.9%) and remuneration package; specifically income (45.2%), allowances (45.2%) and non-commensurate between pay and performance (44.0%). Majority perceived their role as very important in routine clinical tasks such as examination and diagnosis, preventive treatment, extraction of deciduous teeth and oral health promotion. However, fewer than one-half consider complex treatment such as placement of preformed crowns on deciduous teeth (37.1%) and extraction of permanent teeth (37.2%) as very important tasks. Conclusion: Majority expressed high career satisfaction with most aspects of their employment but expressed low satisfaction in remuneration, lack of career advancement opportunities and administrative tasks. We conclude that most Malaysian dental therapists have positive perceptions of their current roles but do not favour wider expansion of their roles. These findings imply that there was a need to develop a more attractive career pathway for therapists to ensure sustainability of effective primary oral healthcare delivery system for Malaysia's children. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons A/S.",Dental services; Dental therapists; Job satisfaction,"adult; career mobility; community care; cross-sectional study; dental assistant; dental procedure; female; health; health personnel attitude; health promotion; health service; human; income; job satisfaction; Malaysia; marriage; middle aged; primary health care; professional delegation; professional-patient relationship; psychology; public relations; salary and fringe benefit; trends; workload; workplace; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Career Mobility; Community Health Services; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delegation, Professional; Dental Auxiliaries; Dental Care; Female; Health Promotion; Humans; Income; Interprofessional Relations; Job Satisfaction; Malaysia; Marital Status; Middle Aged; Oral Health; Primary Health Care; Professional-Patient Relations; Salaries and Fringe Benefits; Urban Health Services; Workload; Workplace",2-s2.0-84937023722

Nuclear imaging may be useful to monitor the response to treatment but limited by the availability.We aimed to determine the role of EEG as a tool for early diagnosis as well as a tool to assess disease progression and response to treatment. Methods: A total of 99 EEGsdone in 16 patients diagnosed with anti-NMDAR encephalitis throughout the course of illness, were reviewed retrospectively. The EEG changes were correlated with the clinical presentations and response to treatment. Sixteen EEGs of patients with schizophrenia and mood disorder, and 10 EEGs of patients with infective encephalitis were included as control. Results: EEGs performed during the psychiatric and cognitive dysfunctionphase in patient with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, showed diffuse background slowing in the delta-theta range in all the patients. Serial EEGs showed that the dominant background frequency improved with improvement in cognitive status. Nine patients had complete recovery with normalisation of the EEG abnormalities. Eight patients had their typical clinical seizure recorded during EEG monitoring, but only 2 (25.0%) with EEG correlation. Ten patients had status epilepticus (62.5%), 5 had EEG recorded during their status epilepticus, of which only one with EEG correlation (20.0%). Eleven patients had asymmetric background (68.8%), but only 1 has correlation with focal changes in the MRI brain (9.1%). Even though the EEGs of patients with infective encephalitis also showed background slowing, their CSF analysis was supportive of an infective cause. EEGs of patients with established psychiatric disorder were within normal limits. Conclusion: EEG abnormality has a good correlation with the degree of psychiatric and cognitive dysfunction in patient with anti-NMDAR encephalitis, and is useful in early diagnosis, monitoring the progress and the response to treatment. However, it has poor correlation with clinical seizures. ? 2015, ASEAN Neurological Association.

The stages of change model was applied in a multicenter quasi-experimental design to evaluate adherence to advocated behaviors in CORFIS patients with hypertension. Based on submitted diet and exercise records (n = 209), adherence to sodium reduction, regular exercise, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake behaviors were quantified against weight, waist circumference (WC), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) changes. Patients were categorized at 6 months into nonadherent/N-A (Precontemplation, Contemplation, and Preparation), newly adherent/NA (Action) and totally adherent/TA (Maintenance) groups. Self-reported adherence records did not meet recommended targets for healthful behaviors, but clinical benefits were achieved by adherent groups as indicated by effect size (Cohen’s d) comparisons. SBP reduction was associated with adherence to sodium reduction in NA (d = 0.60, p <.001) and TA (d = 0.45, p <.001) compared to N-A (d = 0.13, p >.05). Marginally increasing fruit and vegetable consumption (Δ = 0.41 servings) resulted in sizeable reductions in weight for NA (d = 0.81, p <.001) > TA (d = 0.54, p <.001) > N-A (d = 0.21, p >.05) and in WC for NA (d = 0.68, p <.00) > TA (d = 0.53, p <.001) > N-A (d = 0.52, p >.05).

Methods: A prospective cohort study of patients admitted to Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit (NICU), University Malaya Medical Centre and referred for rehabilitation within a period of 12 months. Adult patients with newly diagnosed acquired brain injury with no prior deformity to lower limbs, Glasgow Coma Scale ? 12, no concomitant spinal or lower limb injuries, medical stability at inclusion into the study and agreed to participate for the total duration of assessment (3 months) were recruited. We conducted weekly review of ankle muscle tone and measurement of ankle maximum passive dorsiflexion motion. The end point is reached if ankle contracture developed or completed 3 months post injury assessment. Results: The cohort included 70 patients, of which only 46 patients completed the study. Twenty-eight patients suffered from severe brain injury whilst 18 from moderate brain injury. Out of the 46 patients, 13 (28%) developed ankle contracture at the end of the study period. Abnormal motor pattern was significantly associated with incidence of ankle contracture, which included spasticity (p<0.001), spastic dystonia (p=0.001) and clonus (p=0.015). Using univariate analysis, the predictors for ankle contracture were spasticity (OR 51.67, CI 7.53-354.52, p<0.001), spastic dystonia (OR 27.43 CI 2.84-265.35, p=0.004) and clonus (OR 4.18 CI 1.33-13.19, p =0.015). Conclusion: Abnormal motor patterns are strongly associated with early incidence of ankle contracture amongst adult with new diagnosis of moderate to severe acquired brain injury despite a regular standard therapy program.

A thermal fogger with a discharge rate of 240ml/min was used to disperse Sumithion L-40 at 3 different dosages (350 ml/ha, 500 ml/ha, 750 ml/ha) against lab-bred larvae and adult female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus. An average of more than 80% adult mortality was achieved for outdoor space spray, and 100% adult mortality for indoor space spray, in all tested dosages.

Background: Many local hospitals still alternate positions of jaundiced neonates receiving phototherapy despite the safe infant sleeping protocol of placing them supine. Design: A systematic review was conducted. Methods: Databases that included Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, ScienceDirect, Embase and The Cochrane Library were used. Randomized controlled trials published in English language that evaluate the best position for healthy jaundiced neonates aged day 1 to 14 under phototherapy were searched. In addition, any positioning done every 2-3 hours during phototherapy with the outcome measures being bilirubin reduction and duration of phototherapy were also searched and included (n = 5). Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale was adopted for quality assessment. All processes were conducted by both reviewers independently. Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Guideline were utilised. Out of 20 papers, five were included for qualitative synthesis. Data extraction was based on the template (participants, study designs etcetera) agreed by both authors. Results: All five studies possessed external validity. One paper scored 7, three scored 5 while one scored 3. Four of these studies reported no difference in bilirubin reduction and duration of phototherapy. Only one study reported a significant drop in serum bilirubin and shorter duration of phototherapy in the supine group. Conclusion: It has been proved that keeping the jaundiced newborns in the supine position throughout phototherapy is as effective as turning them periodically based on the appraised studies. Relevance to clinical practice: It is unnecessary to alternate positions of the jaundiced neonates when conventional phototherapy is delivered to lighten nurses' workload. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Alternate; Hyperbilirubinemia; Jaundice; Neonatal; Newborn; Phototherapy; Position; Total serum bilirubin level; Turn,"female; human; infant; Jaundice, Neonatal; male; newborn; patient positioning; phototherapy; supine position; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Jaundice, Neonatal; Male; Patient Positioning; Phototherapy; Supine Position",2-s2.0-84923304520

The false vocal cord microflaps, as biological keels and a relatively new method may replace silastic keel placement in the future.Case Presentation: We report on a case of anterior glottis stenosis with keel aspiration for two weeks, after endoscopic CO2 laser resection of the stenotic section and keel placement. The patient was admitted to our center, where bronchoscopy was performed and the keel was removed. A new custom-made silastic keel was properly placed in raw areas and fixed to the skin with suture through the cricothyroid and thyrohyoid membranes. The keel was removed three weeks later.Introduction: Laryngeal stenosis has various causes and treatment options. Endoscopic resection of the stenotic part with CO2 laser is one of the treatment options of laryngotracheal stenosis. Keels are useful for preventing adhesion formation, restenosis and web formation, which may happen during the later stage.

It is a time when the mother becomes more vulnerable and this reduced level of control can add to the mother's perception of stress and anxiety. Emotional response can cause physical changes that can negatively affect the pregnancy. This study aims to evaluate the prevalence of anxiety symptoms and factors associated with anxiety among out-patient antenatal mother. Design: Cross-sectional study. Materials and Method: A cross sectional survey was conducted with 320 out-patient antenatal mothers from a major teaching hospital in Malaysia. Their anxiety symptoms were assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Descriptive analysis and chi-square were used to evaluate the association between anxiety symptoms with socio-demographic factors, self-esteems and social supports. Result: This study revealed 35.5 % of the pregnant women experiencing significant anxiety symptoms at their first booking. Factors associated with significant anxiety symptoms among antenatal mother are the total family monthly income, mothers' period of gestations, history of obstetric complication and mothers' self-esteem. Conclusion: Anxiety symptoms are prevalent during pregnancy. Intervention to deal with the factors that increase the prevalence of anxiety at this stage is crucial to prevent the development of further psychological problems during pregnancy, delivery and post-delivery. ? 2014 Japan Health Sciences University & Japan International Cultural Exchange Foundation.",Antenatal mother; Anxiety; Pregnancy; Self-esteem,anxiety; cross-sectional study; family study; female; Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale; human; major clinical study; Malaysia; male; mother; outpatient; pregnancy; pregnant woman; prevalence; prevention; self esteem; social support; symptom; teaching hospital; university,2-s2.0-84971579024

The two Kelantan Malay genomes were analyzed for the SNP markers associated with thalassemia and Helicobacter pylori infection. Helicobacter pylori infection was reported to be low prevalence in the north-east as compared to the west coast of the Peninsular Malaysia and beta-thalassemia was known to be one of the most common inherited and genetic disorder in Malaysia.Result: By combining SNP information from literatures, GWAS study and NCBI ClinVar, 18 unique SNPs were selected for further analysis. From these 18 SNPs, 10 SNPs came from previous study of Helicobacter pylori infection among Malay patients, 6 SNPs were from NCBI ClinVar and 2 SNPs from GWAS studies. The analysis reveals that both Royal Kelantan Malay genomes shared all the 10 SNPs identified by Maran (Single Nucleotide Polymorphims (SNPs) genotypic profiling of Malay patients with and without Helicobacter pylori infection in Kelantan, 2011) and one SNP from GWAS study. In addition, the analysis also reveals that both Royal Kelantan Malay genomes shared 3 SNP markers; HBG1 (rs1061234), HBB (rs1609812) and BCL11A (rs766432) where all three markers were associated with beta-thalassemia.Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the Royal Kelantan Malays carry the SNPs which are associated with protection to Helicobacter pylori infection. In addition they also carry SNPs which are associated with beta-thalassemia. These findings are in line with the findings by other researchers who conducted studies on thalassemia and Helicobacter pylori infection in the non-royal Malay population. ? 2014, Wan Juhari et al.; licensee Springer.",Beta-thalassemia; Helicobacter pylori; Malays; Single nucleotide polymorphisms; Whole genome analysis,hemoglobin beta chain; hemoglobin C; Article; B cell lymphoma; beta thalassemia; disease association; disorders of purine and pyrimidine metabolism; DNA fingerprinting; gene sequence; genetic variability; genome analysis; Helicobacter infection; human; Malaysia; male; osteoarthritis; pain; single nucleotide polymorphism; thrombosis; Helicobacter pylori,2-s2.0-84919915283

The major aim of this study was to observe the working conditions, available safety facilities and hygiene maintained by the female workers.Methods: A cross sectional survey was carried out among the randomly selected 384 female workers from different baking industries located at Dhaka and Tangail regions in Bangladesh by a well-designed semi-structured questionnaire.Results: About 33% of all respondents opined the machine room was congested, 27% narrow packaging and sealing room while 37% unhealthy storage areas. Two industries did not have proper accident prevention facilities. Although all the industries had monitoring personnel hygiene practices, about 40% of the workers were found not strictly maintaining some basic personal hygiene criteria. Socio-demographic result showed that the workers education level and monthly family income were poor. About 59.1% of all workers were suffering from various degrees of Chronic Energy Deficiencies (CED). It was also observed that nutritional status of the workers significantly related to their expenditure of the foods and working loads (χ2 Value &lt; 0.05).Conclusion: The survey revealed that the occupational hygiene and safety practices were not at satisfactory level in some selected food industries in Bangladesh.

Residue Trp391 of EIII was used as an intrinsic probe to monitor the change in fluorescence of the tryptophan residue upon binding to a peptide. The analysis was based on the electron excitation at 280 nm and fluorescence emission at 300-400 nm of EIII, followed by quenching of fluorescence in the presence of potential peptidic inhibitors coded DS36wt, DS36opt, DN58wt and DN58opt. The present study found that the fluorescence of the recombinant EIII was quenched following the binding of DS36opt, DN58wt and DN58opt in a concentration-dependent manner. Since the λmax for emission remained unchanged, the effect was not due to a change in the environment of the tryptophan side chain. In contrast, a minimal fluorescence-quenching effect of DS36wt at 20 and 40 μM suggested that the DS36wt does not have any binding ability to EIII. This was supported by a simple native-page gel retardation assay that showed a band shift of EIII domain when incubated with DS36opt, DN58wt and DN58opt but not with DS36wt. We thus developed a low-cost and convenient spectrophotometric binding assay for the analysis of EIII-peptide interactions in a drug screening application. ? 2014 The Pharmaceutical Society of Japan.",Dengue virus type 2; Envelope protein; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Tryptophan assay,"dengue domain iii envelope protein inhibitor; protein inhibitor; recombinant protein; tryptophan; unclassified drug; peptide; protein binding; recombinant protein; tryptophan; virus envelope protein; Article; binding assay; controlled study; dengue; Dengue virus 2; drug interaction; drug screening; fluorescence; fluorescence analysis; fluorescence quenching assay; human; antagonists and inhibitors; biosynthesis; chemistry; Dengue virus; genetics; metabolism; native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; spectrofluorometry; synthesis; Dengue Virus; Native Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis; Peptides; Protein Binding; Recombinant Proteins; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Tryptophan; Viral Envelope Proteins",2-s2.0-84908213644

Currently, infection control is largely based on chemotherapy or live vaccines; however, drug resistance is common and vaccines are relatively expensive. The development of new cost-effective intervention measures will benefit from unraveling the complex genetic mechanisms that underlie host-parasite interactions, including the identification and characterization of genes encoding proteins such as phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K). We previously identified a PIP5K coding sequence within the E. maxima genome. In this study, we analyzed two bacterial artificial chromosome clones presenting a ~145- kb E. maxima (Weybridge strain) genomic region spanning the PIP5K gene locus. Sequence analysis revealed that ~95% of the simple sequence repeats detected were located within regions comparable to the previously described feature-rich segments of the Eimeria tenella genome. Comparative sequence analysis with the orthologous E. maxima (Houghton strain) region revealed a moderate level of conserved synteny. Unique segmental organizations and telomere-like repeats were also observed in both genomes. A number of incomplete transposable elements were detected and further scrutiny of these elements in both orthologous segments revealed interesting nesting events, which may play a role in facilitating genome plasticity in E. maxima. The current analysis provides more detailed information about the genome organization of E. maxima and may help to reveal genotypic differences that are important for expression of traits related to pathogenicity and virulence. ?

Therefore, in this study for development of short length canine specific biomarker, mitochondrial cytochrome b (cytb) gene was targeted using simple PCR assay. Objective: Detection of canine species using short length DNA biomarker targeting cytb gene. Methods: The assay targeted a 100-bp fragment of cytochrome b gene using a pair of canine specific primers. The primers specificity were tested under Insilco, as well as in real PCR assay using dog and eight other species DNAs. The consensus 100 bp canine specific site along with cytb sequences of 14 species including dog and human were used for analysis of pair wise distances, construct dendogram and primers mismatch calculation. The stability of the biomarker was tested under commonly used cooking condition and extensive autoclaving state which was known for degradation of target DNA. The sensitivity of the assay was tested using binary admixture composed of dog and most consumed chicken DNA pool. Results & Discussion: The biomarker was 100% canine specific and successfully amplified 100 bp region of canine cytb gene specific target. It was highly stable and sensitive enough to detect as low as 0.1% (0.02 ng) of canine specific target from admixed DNAs. Conclusion: The primers provided the shortest DNA biomarker for canine species detection. The shortest amplicon length, high stability and sensitivity offered its potentiality for canine biomaterials determination from food as well as from degraded samples. ? 2014 Asian Pacific Tropical Medicine Press.",,biological marker; cytochrome b; DNA; primer DNA; article; assay; computer model; cytb gene; DNA degradation; DNA structure; dog; gene amplification; gene sequence; gene targeting; genetic distance; genetic stability; human; mitochondrion; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; species difference; species identification,2-s2.0-84896734556

Individuals with β-thalassaemia major require regular blood transfusions for survival. Epigenetic studies have revealed differences in methylation status in CpG sites between foetal and maternal DNA. The objectives of this study are to identify informative CpG sites in the β-globin gene and develop a semi-nested methylation-specific PCR for amplification of chorionic villi (CV) DNA (trophoblasts that contribute to foetal DNA). Methods: Extracted DNA from 15 maternal blood and their respective CV samples were subjected to bisulfite conversion. The β-globin gene containing three selected CpG sites and the β-gene mutation at codon 41/42 were amplified using a pair of primers (F1 and R1). Amplicons were sequenced and the methylation status of each CpG site of the converted maternal (cM) was compared to the converted CV (cCV) DNA. Three rounds of semi-nested PCR using three methylation-specific reverse primers (R2, R3 and R4) were amplified in succession with a common forward primer (F1). Results & Discussion: Sequencing results confirmed the three CpG sites were hypermethylated in cM DNA and only partially methylated in cCV DNA. The semi-nested PCR showed amplification in 11 cCV DNA while no band was observed in all maternal DNA. The sensitivity and specificity of this approach is 73% and 100% respectively. Conclusion: Three rounds of semi-nested PCR on cM and cCV DNA have allowed the identification of circulating foetal DNA in maternal plasma. This technique may be utilised for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis of specific β-globin gene mutations from foetal DNA in maternal plasma. ? 2014 Asian Pacific Tropical Medicine Press.",,bisulfite; DNA; fetus DNA; hemoglobin beta chain; primer DNA; unclassified drug; amplicon; article; beta globin gene; chorion villus; controlled study; CpG island; diagnostic accuracy; DNA determination; DNA extraction; DNA methylation; DNA sequence; female; fetus; gene amplification; gene mutation; human; maternal blood; non invasive measurement; polymerase chain reaction; prenatal diagnosis; priority journal; sensitivity and specificity; trophoblast,2-s2.0-84896720853

This disorder mainly results from point mutations, small insertion or deletions in the β-globin gene complex. Beta-thalassaemia major patients require life-long monthly blood transfusions and iron-chelation therapies to sustain their lives. Mutation characterisation is necessary for affected couples at risk of having a β-thalassaemia major child. Objective: 1. To develop the TaqMan genotyping platform as a time- and cost-effective approach for characterisation of β-globin gene mutations. 2. To characterise the mutations using the developed assays in transfusion-dependent patients in Penang and Kedah. Methods: Ten sets of primers and TaqMan probes were designed to identify the common mutations in Malaysian Malays and Chinese: -28 (A→G), CD17 (A→T), CD19 (A→G), HbE (G→A), IVS1-1 (G→T), IVS1-5 (G→C), CD 41/42 (-CTTT), CD71/72 (+A), IVS2-654 (C→T) and Poly A (AATAAAHAATAGA). Another 7 sets of TaqMan genotyping assays were designed to identify the rare mutations in Malays and Chinese: -29 (A→G), Cap (+1) (A→C), CD8/9 (+G), CD16 (-C), CD27/28 (+C), IVS1-1 (G→A) and CD43 (G→T). The developed assays were used to screen 54 and 62 transfusion-dependent patients in Penang and Kedah respectively. Results &amp; Discussion: The developed assays detected 92.9% of mutations in the β-thalassaemia major patients. The remaining mutations were detected by ARMS, gap-PCR and DNA sequencing. The most common mutation in β-thalassaemia major patients in Penang is CD41/42 with a frequency of 20.9%. The most common mutation in β-thalassaemia major patients in Kedah is HbE with a frequency of 30.8%. Conclusion: The simplicity and reproducibility of the TaqMan genotyping assays enable rapid and cost-effective analysis of the β-globin gene mutations in Malaysia. ? 2014 Asian Pacific Tropical Medicine Press.",,CD42 antigen; fibrinogen receptor; hemoglobin beta chain; hemoglobin E; lymphocyte antigen; unclassified drug; article; beta globin gene; blood transfusion; cost effectiveness analysis; DNA sequence; gene mutation; genotype; human; Malaysia; mutational analysis; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; reproducibility; thalassemia major,2-s2.0-84896698997

Un-fractionated plasma was exposed to CuSO4 (5.0 mmol/L), a pro-oxidant, and low frequency ultrasonic wave to induce oxidation, and finally oxidizability was calculated by TBARS and Conjugated Diene methods.Result: In our study, plasma LDL greater than 150 mg/dL possess 1.75 times more risk to undergo oxidation (CI, 0.7774 to 3.94; p = 0.071) than the low LDL plasma, percent of oxidation increased from 38.3% to 67.1% for the LDL level upto 150 mg/dL and high. Lag phase, which is considered as the plasma antioxidative protection, was also influenced by the higher LDL concentration. The mean lag time was 65.27 ± 20.02 (p = 0.02 compared to healthy), where as for 94.71 ± 35.11 min for the normolipidemic subject. The plasma oxidizability was also changed drastically for total cholesterol level, oxidative susceptibility shown 35% and 55.02% for 200 mg/dL and high respectively, however it didn't appear as risk factor. Patient samples were also stratified according to their age, gender, and blood glucose level.

Men's poor engagement in health-promoting activities has been attributed to the socially constructed male gender identity. Hence, health innovations to promote men's health have to take into the account their social identity and health-seeking behavior. The innovation should be flexible, interactive, discreet, informative, and user-friendly. It should also facilitate selfcare. Innovations that deploy information and computer technology (ICT) are promising. MyMan, a future web and mobile application that incorporates self-assessment, individual risk calculation, projection of future health status, and tailored advice, is in the process of prototype development for testing in the community. The main concern about this application is that it may have limited usefulness to an ICT-na?ve population. However, this may be overcome by having a similar application in health clinics where assistance in using the technology can be provided. A randomized controlled trial will be conducted to examine the effectiveness of this innovation, which takes into account men's needs for convenience and privacy. Given the widespread use and flexibility of ICT, it has great potential and deserves further evaluation. ?

It is mainly done with the intention of boosting the effects of products. For many years, the enforcement officers in Malaysia have had difficulty deciding whether some products should be confiscated as they have not been able to produce fast reliable evidence of adulteration. For that reason, we explored the use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) as a potential fast detection method of commercial products marketed in Malaysia that may be adulterated. We confirmed the outcomes qualitatively with high pressure liquid chromatography. DSC was set at a heating rate of 10 C min-1 and within a temperature range of 100-250 C with nitrogen as a purge gas at a flow rate of 20 mL min-1 to analyse a sildenafil reference standard (RS), sildenafil tablets and sildenafil adulterated commercial products. Four sildenafil adulterated commercial products were analysed. Since the melting point of sildenafil in the mixture tended to shift, the presence of sildenafil in three of these adulterated commercial products was confirmed using the spiking method and was re-analysed using DSC. The re-analysed results indicated that the enthalphy of fusion (ΔH) and the resolution peak of sildenafil increased accordingly depending upon the amount of spiked sildenafil RS. Apart from these results, the DSC curves also showed different patterns for sildenafil RS and the mixtures. Therefore, we concluded that DSC can potentially be used to detect sildenafil in adulterated commercial products. ? 2013 The Author(s).",Adulteration; Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); Sildenafil; Thermal analysis,Adulteration; Commercial products; DSC curves; Fast detections; Human health; Reference standard; Sildenafil; Temperature range; High pressure liquid chromatography; Mixtures; Nitrogen; Thermoanalysis; Differential scanning calorimetry,2-s2.0-84893139421

CNTs' unique physical properties and strength play a major part in such a wide application. However, there have been concerns on the deleterious effects of CNTs as a delivery tool for therapeutic proteins, peptides and genes in biomedicine. CNTs disturb normal neuronal function, and accumulate and cause brain damage. Unfunctionalized CNTs were reported to cause toxicity in cells rather than functionalized CNTs. Thus, effects of CNTs on cells should be rigorously tested. In the present study, unfunctionalized multiwall CNTs were introduced to human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells to investigate the toxicity effect. The neurotoxicity test showed that cell viability was above 80 % for CNT at 100 pg/ ml - 1 mg/ ml. The neuroprotective test revealed that viability of cells was less than 40 % and 50 % at 1 μg/ ml -1 mg/ ml and 1 pg/ml - 100 ng/ ml concentration range, respectively. The number of viable cells was decreased, with increase in the concentration of CNT using a reactive oxygen species (ROS) test.

The greatest public health impact of diabetes is its vascular complications, which include both microvascular (retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy) and macrovascular (ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral vascular disease) processes. Given that the diabetes epidemic continues to grow worldwide, there is a clear need for improvements in the management of the disease and its complications. The identifi cation of biomarkers and pathogenic determinants of progression not only could provide tools physicians could use to monitor disease progression but could also give important insights into the mechanisms behind diabetic vascular complications, thus potentially opening new avenues for treatment. The roles played by circulating miRNAs in diabetes mellitus (DM) and its vascular complications, both as biomarkers of disease and as critical contributors to disease progression, are not very clear. Recently, researchers have identifi ed powerful roles for circulating miRNAs and their potential therapeutic implications, partly by advances in various technologies with which researchers can identify circulating miRNAs (next-generation sequencing, RNA Seq, digital qPCR, etc.) and then successfully isolate and study them. Circulating miRNAs play a role in the metabolic, infl ammatory, and antiangiogenic pathways in type 2 diabetes (T2D). ? Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

A steering committee comprising a member of WONCA Asia Pacific Regional (APR) council and the President of Fiji College of General Practitioners garnered sponsorship from Fiji Ministry of Health, WONCA APR and pharmaceutical agencies to organize the event in October 2013. This paper describes the processes needed to set up a national primary research agenda through the collaborative efforts of local stakeholders and external facilitators using a test case in South Pacific. Method: The setting was a 2-day primary care research workshop in Fiji. The steering committee invited a team of three external facilitators from the Asia-Pacific region to organize and operationalize the workshop. The eventual participants were 3 external facilitators, 6 local facilitators, and 29 local primary care physicians, academics, and local medical leaders from Fiji and South Pacific Islands. Pre-workshop and main workshop programs were drawn up by the external facilitators, using participants' input of research topics relating to their local clinical issues of interest. Course notes were prepared and distributed before the workshop. In the workshop, proposed research topics were shortlisted by group discussion and consensus. Study designs were proposed, scrutinized, and adopted for further research development. Results: The facilitators reviewed the processes in setting the research agenda after the workshop and conceived the proposed 6E model. These processes can be grouped for easy reference, comprising the pre-workshop stages of ""entreat"", ""enlist"", ""engage"", and the workshop stages of ""educe"", ""empower"", and ""encapsulate"". Conclusion: The 6E model to establish a research agenda is conceptually logical. Its feasibility can be further tested in its application in other situation where research agenda setting is the critical step to improve the quality of primary care. ? 2014 Tan et al.",Collaboration; Model; Primary care; process; Research agenda; Workshop,Asia; consensus; feasibility study; Fiji; general practitioner; human; human experiment; leadership; model; study design,2-s2.0-84989191977

The dawn of the post-genomic era has witnessed several major breakthroughs in personalized medicine, and it has been an exciting time for the emergence of targeted chemotherapy for cancers with distinctive molecular characteristics. Yet, the development of drug resistance continues to hinder the success of chemotherapy, and it is often viewed as the outcome of cancer cell-autonomous processes. In fact, recent evidence points to the fact that the host environment itself can be equally guilty. Tumor fibroblasts - one of the responsible perpetrators - cooperate with the tumor cells to initiate and drive tumor progression. These cells are prominent members in most carcinoma tissues, and they provide a protective niche for tumor cells to escape from cytotoxic effects of chemotherapy. This chapter discusses the different types and origins of fibroblast population that exist within solid tumors, and their roles in dictating the response of tumors to therapies. The underlying key mechanisms by which the dynamic tumor-fibroblast cell interaction allow escape from therapeutic drugs and the eventual development of drug resistance are also discussed. This evidence supports the notion that tumor fibroblasts can potentially be a good target in overcoming drug resistance, and such tumor-fibroblast cell interaction should be targeted for designing more effective and less resistance-prone anti-cancer therapies. ? 2014 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Scientific studies have demonstrated that extracts and purified isolated compounds (flavonoids, lignans, phenols, and terpenes) obtained from these plants possess antiviral effects against herpes simplex (HSV) and dengue virus infections (DENV). These observations are associated with the disruption of essential proteins needed during viral cycle, thus halting the viral replication. In addition, the Phyllanthus species have also been shown to exert inhibitory effects against selected cancers types. In these studies anti-proliferative, anti-metastatic, anti-angiogenic effects and induced apoptosis of human cancers cell lines were observed.

The occurrence of this occupational malady has doubled from 120 million to 250 million in a decade. Countries such as Malaysia, India, and the US have adopted 90 dBA as the permissible exposure limit. According to the US Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the exposure limit for noise is 90 dBA, while that of the US National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is 85 dBA for 8 hours of noise exposure. Objectives: This study aimed to assess the development of hearing threshold levels beyond 25 dBA on adoption of 85 dBA as the permissible exposure limit compared to 90 dBA. Patients and Methods: This is an intervention study done on two automobile factories. There were 203 employees exposed to noise levels beyond the action level. Hearing protection devices were distributed to reduce noise levels to a level between the permissible exposure limit and action level. The permissible exposure limits were 90 and 85 dBA in factories 1 and 2, respectively, while the action levels were 85 and 80 dBA, respectively. The hearing threshold levels of participants were measured at baseline and at first month of postshift exposure of noise. The outcome was measured by a manual audiometer. McNemar and chi-square tests were used in the statistical analysis. Results: We found that hearing threshold levels of more than 25 dBA has changed significantly from pre-intervention to post-intervention among participants from both factories (3000 Hz for the right ear and 2000 Hz for the left ear). There was a statistically significant association between participants at 3000 Hz on the right ear at ‘deteriorated’ level (χ2 (1) = 4.08, φ = - 0.142, P = 0.043), whereas there was worsening of hearing threshold beyond 25 dBA among those embraced 90 dBA. Conclusions: The adoption of 85 dBA as the permissible exposure limit has preserved hearing threshold level among participants at 3000 Hz compared to those who embraced 90 dBA. ? 2014, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal; Published by Kowsar.",Effects 85 or 90 dBA; Noise; Noise-Induced Hearing loss; Threshold shift,adult; alcohol consumption; Article; audiometer; auditory threshold; ear protective device; female; hearing impairment; human; human experiment; intervention study; male; maximum permissible dose; normal human; questionnaire; risk; smoking,2-s2.0-84929994281

It is rare for this infection to occur on the face, and it is exceptionally rare for it to involve the nose and sinuses. This paper reports a rare case of nasal chromoblastomycosis in a 50-year-old Malaysian male. Case report: The patient, who was a rubber plantation worker in the southern state of Johor, presented to the ENT clinic with a history of epistaxis. He did not recall any history of injury to the nose. Nasal endoscopy showed a pale yellowish lesion at the inferior edge of the left middle turbinate. Histology revealed that this was a case of chromoblastomycosis. Conclusion: Chromoblastomycosis of the nasal cavity is very rare and can be mistaken for other granulomatous conditions in the nose. It progresses very slowly over many years. Our patient was managed conservatively, as he was not keen on undergoing surgical intervention. Lesion size remained the same at five months' follow up, with no recurrence of epistaxis. Copyright ?

Current trends of walking rehabilitation adopted is functional electrical stimulation (FES) assisted gait with partial body weight support. However, lack of lower limb proprioception, inability to control complex joint trajectory, rapid energy consumption, unstable and insufficient muscle force due to motor unit recruitment strategy often lead to fatigue thus constituting major limitation. Substantial literatures document significant effect of FES assisted rehabilitation of SCI individuals with highlights on functional gait and characteristics. Advances in neuroscience have also improved FES assisted gait but limiting effect of muscle fatigue consistently remains a considerable challenge. It is also evident from reviewed articles that rate of fatigue during FES elicited contraction is generally higher than voluntary contractions. By implication, optimized functional recovery of people with SCI by FES could significantly improve once muscle fatigue is addressed. This review constitutes a unique attempt to assess available evidence of effects and extents of muscle fatigue in FES assisted walking of SCI patients. It highlights state of the art procedures to minimize fatigue and looking forward to approaches that could further reduce the effect of fatigue on FES evoked contraction for patient enhanced beneficial gait to avoid secondary illness due to physical inability. The outcome of this study is relevant in clinical optimization of effects of FES rehabilitation on individuals with SCI. ?

Data are selected to statistically analyze from normal subject (n=202, age range: 20-69) and cardiovascular patient (n=41, mean age: 68.95±10.99). A t-test is used to determine age effect on the normal subject. Multivariate analysis is used to determine the correlation of multiple BFV indices with age. In the healthy subjects, there are negative correlation of resistive index (RI) and vascular elasticity index (VEI), whereas positive correlation of velocity reflection index (VRI) with age (p<0.001). For further analysis, fifty-two healthy subjects were selected from healthy group (age mean: 57.12±4.50) as control after matching their age with cardiovascular patient group. After testing the normality of data, a Student’s t-test is used to determine BFV waveform and its indices in the two groups. In the study, we found that there are significant difference of BFV and indices in cardiovascular patients and normal subjects after controlling the age and gender.

However, the most native shape of the synthesized gold nanoparticles, which is spherical in shape, will give the LSPR similar to the intrinsic chromophores in human native tissues, that is ±520nm. This phenomenon has caused a disadvantage in the utilization of gold nanosphere (GNS) in some of the applications that utilized LSPR such as the plasmonic photothermal therapy (PPTT) in cancer treatment because of the interference of the human native tissues and the efficacy of such treatment will be much reduced. To solve this issue, alternative such as shifting the LSPR of the synthesized gold nanoparticles to the near infra-red (NIR) spectra, which range from 700nm to 1000nm, that is able to avoid the overlapping of the LSPR of spherical gold nanoparticles and the human tissues.

To extract these relations, we applied the Bayesian Network (BN) model to data collected in the stance phase of walking. For a better understanding of foot function, the experimental data were divided into three stages (initial contact, loading response to mid-stance, and terminal stance to pre-swing). BNs were constructed for these three stages of data for normal walking and simulated hemiplegic walking, then compared and analyzed. Results showed that BNs extracted could express the underlying mechanism of foot function. ?

Magnetic resonance imaging revealed an expansile lesion at the base of the 5th metacarpal bone of her right hand with cortical erosion and patchy enhancement suggestive of a malignant transformation of a giant-cell tumor. A core needle biopsy of this lesion showed a metastatic adenocarcinoma on histopathological examination which was immunoreactive to cytokeratin (CK) 7 and thyroid transcription factor (TTF)-1 but not to CK20 suggesting a lung primary. A chest radiograph and computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a right upper lobe lung mass. Fluoro-deoxyglucose hypermetabolism was noted in the lung mass and the right 5th metacarpal bone lesion but not elsewhere on positron-emission-tomography/CT scan. Needle biopsy of the lung mass showed adenocarcinoma with histopathological and immunohistochemical features similar to that of the right 5th metacarpal bone lesion.

This preliminary experimental study aims to verify that the measured voltage signal evoked by functional electrical stimulator across healthy human muscles satisfies the ohm's law and is independent of electromyography signal, electrostatic charges and earthing effect which has potential to affect the sensory feedback of the stimulator. Four able-bodied subjects were recruited to undergo evoked muscle contraction with voltage measured across their electrically stimulated tibialis anterior and brachialis muscles. The tolerated stimulation current amplitude used in this experiment was 20mA to 43mA. The stimulation current pulse width and frequency were fixed at 200us and 35Hz respectively, as the parameters evoked the most consistent response. Results showed that the range of measured voltage that is least affected by noise is above 0.1V at room temperature. The measured voltage satisfied ohm's law with linear voltage-current relationship (r = 0.98). A trend of increased resistance over time may was observed, which may suggest change in muscle behavior throughout the evoked contraction period. These preliminary results suggested strong relationship between muscle activation with measured voltage and resistance. This warrants further exploration study on spinal cord injured subjects with respect to force production to verify the efficacy of the sensory feedback. The acquisition region range setting will then be used on spinal cord injured subject to validate effectiveness of muscle activation feedback sensor during functional electrical stimulation assisted exercise. ? 2014 The Authors.",Closed loop; Feedback sensor; FES,,2-s2.0-84925651381

We specifically looked for instruments which: assess men’s health, frailty and fitness; predict life expectancy, mortality and morbidities. The instruments were assessed by the researchers who then agreed on the tools to be included in the MHI. When there was disagreements, the researchers discussed and reached a consensus guided by the principle that the MHI could be used in the primary care setting targetting men aged 55-65 years.Results: The instruments chosen include the Charlson’s Combined Comorbidity-Age Index; the International Index of Erectile Function-5; the International Prostate Symptom Score; the Androgen Deficiency in Aging Male; the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe Frailty Instrument; the Sitting-Rising Test; the Senior Fitness Test; the Fitness Assessment Score; and the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21. A pilot test on eight men was carried out and showed that the men’s health index is viable.Conclusions: The concept of assessing, stratifying, and optimizing men’s health should be incorporated into routine health care, and this can be implemented by using the MHI. This index is particularly useful to primary care physicians who are in a strategic position to engage men at the peri-retirement age in a conversation about their life goals based on their current and predicted health status. ?

Optimization of the Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) is taking into consideration for reducing building impact on human. However, through some amount of experiments based on rating tools for acoustical performances in green office buildings, the authors have come to the question about the effectiveness of green buildings' design strategies onto acoustical comfort in comparison to the conventional buildings. Thus, the objective of this study is to investigate the level of acoustic performance and occupants' satisfaction on their acoustic environment in green office buildings and in conventional office buildings in Malaysia. Two green office buildings and two conventional office buildings were chosen for the study. To investigate the acoustical performance, series of physical measurement were done to measure the relevant acoustical parameters. Occupants' satisfaction was studied through questionnaire surveys. Initial findings show that the acoustical performance in green office buildings is within the acceptable criteria range. However, in comparison to conventional buildings, it is considered unsatisfactory. Copyright ?

Methods: Sixteen patients with localized myalgia participated in this pilot study. Thirty-six healthy individuals served as controls. The participants were examined clinically for the presence of the TMD according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD, and the salivary levels of HHV-6 were measured by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The Z test, Student t test, and Mann- Whitney U test were used as appropriate. Results: The results demonstrated that 77.8% of healthy individuals were HHV-6 positive, but a significantly lower proportion (43.8%) of the TMD patients with localized myalgia were positive for HHV-6 (P < .05, Fisher exact test). The levels of HHV-6B DNA were lower in the saliva of HHV-6-positive TMD patients with localized myalgia (median: 564 genome/mL; range: 184 to 5,835 genome/mL) than in that of healthy individuals (median: 1,081 genome/mL; range: 193 to 8,807 genome/mL), but the difference was not statistically significant (P > .05, Mann-Whitney U test).

In this study, we attempted to investigate the association of the rs3213207 (P1635) genetic polymorphism of the DTNBP1 gene with methamphetamine dependence and with methamphetamine-induced psychosis, manic episodes, and panic disorder in a male Malaysian population.Methods: This polymorphism was genotyped in 233 male methamphetamine-dependent subjects and in 301 male controls of the following 4 different ethnicities: Malay, Chinese, Kadazan-Dusun, and Bajau. Intergroup statistical analyses were performed by using the χ<inf>2</inf> test and the Fisher exact test where necessary. In cases of multiple comparisons, the Bonferroni correction was performed..Results: Our results indicated that the DTNBP1 rs3213207 polymorphism did not show any significant association with risk of methamphetamine dependence, either in the pooled subjects or after stratification into the 4 different ethnic groups (P > 0.05). Furthermore, we did not find any association of this polymorphism with methamphetamine-induced psychosis and episodes of methamphetamine-induced mania. However, there was a strong association between this polymorphism and the occurrence of methamphetamine-induced panic disorder in the pooled subjects (odds ratio [OR] = 6.739, P < 0.001) and in the Malay (OR = 11.93, P = 0.022) and Kadazan-Dusun (OR = 115.0, P < 0.001) groups..Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the DTNBP1 rs3213207 polymorphism may contribute to methamphetamine-induced panic dis-order in the pooled Malaysian male population, especially in the Malay and Kadazan-Dusun ethnic groups.

HbA1c should be measured regularly in all patients with diabetes, and values should be maintained below 7% to prevent the risk of chronic complications. Apart from the genetic variants of haemoglobins many other conditions also known to affect HbA1c measurements. In this study we evaluated the conditions that cause low HbA1c results.Methods and Materials: The data was collected retrospectively HbA1c was measured in our laboratory by Biorad Variant II turbo 2.0. The method is based on chromatographic separation of HbA1c on a cation exchange cartridge. This method has been certified by National Glycohemoglobin Standardization Programme (NGSP). 58437 requests were received in a period of one year (January to December 2011). Medical records were reviewed to identify the conditions that might be associated with these low values.Results: Among 58437 samples analysed, 53 patients had HbA1c levels < 4.0%. Fourteen patients had haemoglobinopathy. In 34 patients without Hb variants had conditions such as chronic liver disease, chronic kidney disease, haemolytic anaemia, pregnancy, and anaemia of chronic disease. Five non-pregnant individuals who were screened for diabetes mellitus had HbA1c levels < 4%.Conclusion: Our study underscores the importance of that both laboratories and the physicians should be aware of the factors that can influence the HbA1c results. The haematological status should be taken into consideration for proper interpretation of HbA1c results. ? 2014 Malaysian Medical Association.

As a result of high disease burden, TB control measures in these countries are usually concentrated on intensifying active disease case-finding and early treatment of infectious TB. On the contrary, in countries with low disease burden, the focus is on contact investigation to identify latently infected individuals and prophylactically treating them to prevent disease reactivation and transmission. These two strategies are deemed important for the effective TB control. Nonetheless, WHO cautions that targeted contact investigation and latent TB infection (LTBI) treatment should only be undertaken by countries that have the operational capacity/ resources and have achieved ? 85% treatment success rate of active TB. The screening of LTBI is further challenged by the lack of a “gold standard” test to identify and validate individuals with this condition. Tuberculin skin test (TST) is still the preferred investigation as it is cheap, widely available and validated in many trials. The sensitivity and specificity of the newer test—interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) for LTBI screening has been encouraging in low prevalence countries. However, the evidence supporting such usage remains uncertain in high burden settings. Diagnosis of LTBI should adhere to the strict criteria outlined in the guidelines to avoid misdiagnosing active TB as LTBI. The treatment of the latter involved only one or two anti-TB drugs. It has been demonstrated that in the properly conducted contact screening and LTBI treatment, chances of the emergence of multi-drug-resistant TB is very low. ? 2014, Academy of Family Physicians of Malaysia.

Forty subjects were recruited, with 20 diagnosed with aortic stenosis (AS) and the remaining 20 identified with normal aortic valve. Morphological findings of the aortic valve were compared between these two modalities. Maximum AVA was measured planimetrically in mid-systole with DSCT angiography (AVACT) and compared with TTE-derived AVA (AVATTE). There was more than 90% concordance of valve morphology between DSCT angiography and TTE (sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 100%). There was excellent correlation between AVACT and AVATTE (r =0.98, p&lt;0.001). Bland Altman analysis showed good inter-modality agreement (95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.26-0.51 cm2) with slight overestimation of AVA (+0.13 cm2) by DSCT. Very good correlation was observed between AVACT and the mean as well as peak transvalvular pressure gradients (r 2 = 0.82 and 0.84 respectively).

Majority of the studies were cross sectional in nature. Therefore, a case-control study was designed to test the hypothesis that HHS is a risk factor to caries experience in permanent teeth. Calculation of sample size was based on the ratio of 1 case to 4 controls. Case was defined as a child aged 13-14 years old with caries in at least one second permanent molar and control was defined as a child from the same age and school with no caries second permanent molars. Matching was done for gender and ethnicity. School dental records provided information on oral health status and oral hygiene status. Information on HHS, socio-economic status, child's smoking status and child's oral health practices were obtained from a self administered questionnaire, completed by the children and their parents. The result showed that 55.9% of the case group was exposed to HHS, as compared to 44.1% among the control group. In the final multiple logistic regression model after controlling for important risk factors for caries, children with caries were almost twice as likely to have been exposed to HHS for more than 10 years as compared to children with no caries, (Adjusted OR=1.90 and 95% CI=1.35, 2.60). In addition, children who only received dental care from the school dental service had reduced risk of having dental caries by more than one third (36%) as compared with those who received dental care from school dental service (SDS) as well as had additional dental problem solving visit outside SDS (Adjusted OR=0.64 and 95% CI=0.50, 0.90). It is concluded that exposure to HHS for a long duration (> than 10 years) increase the risk to have caries experience in permanent teeth of children. Copyright Reserved ?

The results showed that the methanolic extract of Cyathula prostrata increased the survival period of animals, decreased the body weight and also altered many hematological markers and also restored the antioxidant enzymes when compared to the mice of the DLA control group. These findings indicate that the methanolic extract of C. prostrata has anti-tumor activity by preventing the lipid peroxidation and thereby promoting the antioxidant systems in Dalton's lymphoma ascites induced mice.

Methods. Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was used to profile unique deletions and amplifications that are involved with tongue and cheek SCC, respectively. This was followed by pathway analysis relating to CNA genes from both sites. Results. The most frequently amplified regions in tongue SCC were 4p16.3, 11q13.4, and 13q34; whereas the most frequently deleted region was 19p12. For cheek SCC, the most frequently amplified region was identified on chromosome 9p24.1-9p23; whereas the most common deleted region was located on chromosome 8p23.1. Further analysis revealed that the most significant unique pathway related to tongue and cheek SCCs was the cytoskeleton remodeling and immune response effect on the macrophage differentiation pathway.

In this context, VBD is defined as the ratio of fibroglandular tissue volume to total breast volume. We collected anthropomorphic and body composition data for 2457 subjects undergoing mammographic examination at the University of Malaya Medical Centre, Kuala Lumpur. The data included weight, height, BMI and BFM which were measured with a body composition analyzer. We also measured waist and hip circumferences for 500 of these subjects. A VBD assessment system (Volpara) was used to analyze mammograms. Our results showed that VBD is not significantly correlated with BMI (r2 = 0.17), BFM (r2 = 0.19), WHR (r2 = 0.11). We also noted that VBD is highest among Malaysian women below 40 years old. VBD is highest for Chinese (mean = 11.3%), followed by Malay (mean = 10.1%) and Indian (mean = 9.4%).

We also consider the use of other imaging modalities of estimating breast density, including CT. Clinically, breast density has now moved from being a controversial, even derided subject to one which is widely accepted with an expanding number of clinical uses. It is proven that a woman's breast density is a strong predictor of the failure of mammographic screening to detect breast cancer and thus can be used to indicate where alternate modalities might be considered. It is proven that breast density is a strong predictor of the risk of developing breast cancer and thus can be used to start to consider tailored screening programs. We review the current widely known clinical uses along with the lesser known uses, such as assessing the benefits of chemoprevention and generating more accurate radiation dose estimates.

This case describes a 74-year-old woman who presented with symptoms of heart failure and concomitant involvement of salivary glands and keratoconjunctivitis. An echocardiogram demonstrated ostium secundum atrial septal defect with left to right shunt and severe pulmonary hypertension. Laboratory investigations confirmed the diagnosis of Sj?gren's syndrome (SS) with positive anti-nuclear factor and centromere SS-A/Ro pattern. Anti-Ro (SS-A) was found positive. Atrial septal defect was closed through transcatheter route with significant improvement in clinical outcome.

Thus it lays emphasis on the accessibility and affordability of health care services. In order to achieve these objectives, it is very important to expand curative services as well as preventive services in the country. The major hurdles faced by the country are result of the inherent structural problem faced by the county which leads to sever diseconomies of scale in the provision of healthcare services. Community and individual involvement and self-reliance are very important to achieve Health for All by the Year 200 AD. Community participation is one of the domains of community capacity building in a small island country. It is one of the mechanisms to empower people to take part in community development. In this paper, the nature, the dimensions of community participation, and its role and scope in implementation of different components of primary health care have been described.

Most of the studies use only clinicopathologic factors without taking into consideration the tumour biology and molecular information, while some studies use genomic markers or microarray information only without the clinicopathologic parameters. Thus, these studies may not be able to prognoses a patient effectively. Previous studies have shown that prognosis results are more accurate when using both clinicopathologic and genomic data. The objectives of this research were to apply hybrid artificial intelligent techniques in the prognosis of oral cancer based on the correlation of clinicopathologic and genomic markers and to prove that the prognosis is better with both markers. The proposed hybrid model consisting of two stages, where stage one with ReliefF-GA feature selection method to find an optimal feature of subset and stage two with ANFIS classification to classify either the patients alive or dead after certain years of diagnosis. The proposed prognostic model was experimented on two groups of oral cancer dataset collected locally here in Malaysia, Group 1 with clinicopathologic markers only and Group 2 with both clinicopathologic and genomic markers. The results proved that the proposed model with optimum features selected is more accurate with the use of both clinicopathologic and genomic markers and outperformed the other methods of artificial neural network, support vector machine and logistic regression. This prognostic model is feasible to aid the clinicians in the decision support stage and to identify the high risk markers to better predict the survival rate for each oral cancer patient.",ANFIS; Clinicopathologic; Genomic; Oral cancer prognosis; ReliefF-GA,artificial intelligence; cancer; genetic marker; genomics; oral health,2-s2.0-84898606969

Methods: A cross-sectional, retrospective study was performed on 100 T2DM patients at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC) who were prescribed with at least one antidiabetic medication between January 2007 and December 2011. Results: Using data from their medical records, it was determined that both fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glycated hemoglobin (A1c) levels among all subjects were lower than baseline values. However, the reductions were not significant (p = 0.239 and p = 0.093). Factors that were significantly associated with the response to diabetic medications, include hypertension (p = 0.011), sulfonylureas (p = 0.041), beta-blockers (p = 0.005), and baseline A1c levels (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Treatment of T2DM can be further optimized to ensure that diabetes is well-controlled. ? Pharmacotherapy Group, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Benin, Benin City, 300001 Nigeria.
