"Determinants of the performance of traditional Chinese medicine clinics in Taiwan",2019,"The study attempts to investigate the features and determinants of the performance of Taiwanese Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) Clinics with data for 4905 TCM clinics over the 1998 to 2012 period. The empirical results from the fixed effects model and the Hausman-Taylor Model with cluster-robust standard errors reveal several interesting findings. First, consumer characteristics such as the frequency of disabling injuries has positive impacts on the volume of medical services provided by TCM clinics. These results imply that people are likely to select TCM as the option for medical treatment when they face the occurrence of physical injury in Taiwan. In addition, the scale measurements for TCM clinics including the numbers of physicians, medical personnel and divisions have significantly positive effects on the performance of TCM clinics, while their survival length also has the same effect. Finally, the global budget system under the NHI plays a key role in suppressing the revenue of TCM clinics through the peer review mechanism. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Article; budget; Chinese medicine; cluster analysis; consumer; human; medical personnel; medical service; morbidity; national health insurance; overall survival; peer review; physical disability; physician; Taiwan; Taiwanese"
"Fabrication of redox-responsive Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se2 micelles for doxorubicin delivery",2019,"Stimuli-responsive polymeric nanostructures have emerged as potential drug carriers for cancer therapy. Herein, we synthesized redox-responsive diselenide bond containing amphiphilic polymer, Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se2 from mPEG-PLGA and 3,3′-diselanediyldipropanoic acid (DSeDPA) using DCC/DMAP as coupling agents. Due to its amphiphilic nature, Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se2 self-assembled in to stable micelles in aqueous solution with a hydrodynamic size of 123.9 ± 0.85 nm. The Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se2 micelles exhibited DOX-loading content (DLC) of 6.61 wt% and encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 54.9%. The DOX-loaded Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se2 micelles released 73.94% and 69.54% of their cargo within 72 h upon treatment with 6 mM GSH and 0.1% H2O2, respectively, at pH 7.4 and 37 °C. The MTT assay results demonstrated that Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se2 was devoid of any inherent toxicity and the DOX-loaded micelles showed pronounced antitumor activities against HeLa cells, 44.46% of cells were viable at maximum dose of 7.5 ?g/mL. The cellular uptake experiment further confirmed the internalization of DOX-loaded Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se2 micelles and endowed redox stimuli triggered drug release in cytosol and nuclei of cancer cells. Overall, the results suggested that the smart, biocompatible Bi(mPEG-PLGA)-Se2 copolymer could serve as potential drug delivery biomaterial for the controlled release of hydrophobic drugs in cancer cells. ? 2019","3,3' diselanediyldipropanoic acid; amphophile; copolymer; doxorubicin; methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol); nanocarrier; polyglactin; polymer; unclassified drug; antineoplastic antibiotic; doxorubicin; macrogol; methoxypolyethyleneglycol-poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid); polyester; antineoplastic activity; aqueous solution; Article; biocompatibility; cancer chemotherapy; cell nucleus; cell viability; cellular uptake; cellular, subcellular and molecular biological phenomena and functions; chemical bond; controlled drug release; controlled study; critical micelle concentration; cytosol; diselenide bond; drug delivery system; drug efficacy; drug stability; encapsulation efficiency; HaCat cell line; HeLa cell line; hydrodynamics; hydrophobicity; in vitro study; internalization; kinetic parameters; maximum permissible dose; micelle; micellization; MTT assay; nanoencapsulation; nanofabrication; nanopharmaceutics; oxidation reduction potential; particle size; pH; priority journal; cell line; cell survival; chemistry; drug effect; drug release; human; micelle; oxidation reduction reaction; Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Drug Liberation; Humans; Micelles; Oxidation-Reduction; Polyesters; Polyethylene Glycols"
"One size fits all? In search of the desirable caption display for second language learners with different caption reliance in listening comprehension",2019,"Existing research has established captions as effective second-language (L2) or foreign language (FL) listening comprehension aids. However, due to the transient nature of captions, not all learners are capable of attending to captions in all cases. Previous work posited that to leverage the impact of technologies in learning and instruction, a better understanding of the interplay between technology and cognition is warranted. In this vein, the current study set out to investigate the effects of four different caption modes (full vs. partial vs. real-time vs. control) on the listening comprehension of 95 high-intermediate Taiwanese learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) with different caption reliance (i.e. more-caption-reliant vs. less-caption-reliant). The results showed no significant difference between the participants’ listening comprehension outcomes under the four caption conditions when their caption reliance was not considered. However, when this was considered, the differences among the four caption conditions became salient, which was suggestive of the selective effect of captions on L2 learners with different caption reliance. While less-caption-reliant L2 learners had the best listening comprehension outcome under the partial-caption condition and the worst under the full-caption condition, more-caption-reliant L2 learners exhibited the best performance under the full-caption condition yet the worst under the partial-caption condition. The finding underscores the importance of considering L2 learners’ processing profiles when utilizing captioned videos as multimodal instructional/learning materials and speaks to the need of utilizing differentiated video materials for optimal listening outcomes. ?

"Recent advances in tungsten-oxide-based materials and their applications",2019,"Among several active photothermal nanomaterials, tungsten-oxide-based materials have received considerable attention recently because of their ability to absorb near-infrared (NIR) light and their efficient light-to-heat conversion properties. In addition, tungsten-oxide-based materials have an unusual oxygen defect structure and strong local surface plasma resonance (LSPR), which offers strong photoabsorption in a broad wavelength range of the NIR region. In the past, several light-absorbing nanomaterials such as noble metals, polymeric materials, and other inorganic nanomaterials were of interest for their use in photothermal therapy for cancer treatment. In this study, we review the synthesis, properties, and applications of tungsten-oxide-based nanomaterials as a new type of photothermal material. The basic ideas behind photothermal nanomaterial development as well as the factors that influence their structural designs are also discussed in this study. In addition, recent progress in various fields such as NIR light-shielding, pyroelectric, water evaporation, photocatalysis, gas sensors, and energy-related applications for WO 3?x - and M x WO 3 -based nanomaterials (including their hybrids) are highlighted. Finally, this review presents promising insights into this rapidly growing field that may inspire additional research leading to practical applications. ? 2019 Wu, Naseem, Chou, Wang and Jian.",""
"Oligopeptide-side chained alginate nanocarrier for melittin-targeted chemotherapy",2019,"A melittin-targeting drug carrier was successfully synthesized by the grafting of sodium alginate to an oligopeptide via an amidation method at different oligopeptide:alginate unit molar ratios. The average sizes of the oligopeptide–alginate nanoparticles formed in the presence of 1 mM CaCl2 decreased with increasing oligopeptide contents, indicating intramolecular interactions between oligopeptide-side chains. While the doxorubicin-loading efficiency on nanoparticles (0.1:1) was similar to that of alginate nanoparticles, the melittin-loading onto oligopeptide–alginate nanoparticles (0.1:1) was more than double that onto alginate nanoparticles, suggesting the specific interaction of melittin with the oligopeptide-side chain in the oligopeptide–alginate nanoparticles. While 2.5 μM free melittin caused almost no damage to Caco-2 cells, more than 80% of cells did not survive under the dose of 2.5 μM melittin-loaded oligopeptide–alginate nanoparticles. The results confirm that the derivation of an oligopeptide-side chain in alginate offers a specific binding site for melittin and effectively works in cancer chemotherapy. ? 2019, The Society of Polymer Science, Japan.","Chemotherapy; Chlorine compounds; Molar ratio; Nanoparticles; Peptides; Sodium alginate; Cancer Chemotherapy; Intramolecular interactions; Loading efficiency; Nanocarriers; Oligopeptides; Specific binding; Specific interaction; Targeted chemotherapy; Targeted drug delivery"
"Non-Anticoagulant Heparin Prodrug Loaded Biodegradable and Injectable Thermoresponsive Hydrogels for Enhanced Anti-Metastasis Therapy",2019,"Metastasis is a pathogenic spread of cancer cells from the primary site to surrounding tissues and distant organs, making it one of the primary challenges for effective cancer treatment and the major cause of cancer mortality. Heparin-based biomaterials exhibit significant inhibition of cancer cell metastasis. In this study, a non-anticoagulate heparin prodrug is developed for metastasis treatment with a localized treatment system using temperature sensitive, injectable, and biodegradable (poly-(ε-caprolactone-co-lactide)-b-poly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(ε-caprolactone-co-lactide) polymeric hydrogel. The drug molecule (heparin) is conjugated with the polymer via esterification, and its sustained release is ensured by hydrolysis and polymeric biodegradation. An aqueous solution of the polymer could be used as an injectable solution at below 25 °C and it achieves gel formation at 37 °C. The anti-metastasis effect of the hydrogels is investigated both in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that local administration of injectable heparin-loaded hydrogels effectively promote an inhibitory effect on cancer metastasis. ? 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

"Diselenide linkage containing triblock copolymer nanoparticles based on Bi(methoxyl poly(ethylene glycol))-poly(ε-carprolactone): Selective intracellular drug delivery in cancer cells",2019,"Redox-responsive diselenide bond containing triblock copolymer Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL,Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL was developed for specific drug release in cancer cells. Initially, ditosylated polycaprolactone was prepared via the reaction between polycaprolactone diol (PCL-diol) and tosyl chloride (TsCl). Next, Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL was synthesized via the reaction between ditosylated polycaprolactone and sodium diselenide initiated poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether tosylate. The synthesized amphiphilic triblock copolymer could self-assemble into uniform nanoparticles in aqueous medium and disassemble upon redox stimuli. The Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL nanoparticles showed a DOX loading content of 5.1 wt% and a loading efficiency of 49%. In vitro drug release studies showed that about 62.4% and 56% of DOX was released from the nanoparticles during 72 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 2 mg/mL (6 mM) GSH and 0.1% H2O2, respectively, whereas only about 30% of DOX was released in PBS under the same conditions. The cell viability (MTT assays) results showed that the synthesized material was biocompatible with above 90% cell viability, and that the DOX-loaded Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL nanoparticles had a high antitumor activity against HeLa cells and low antitumor activity against HaCaT cells, following a 24-h incubation period. Three-dimensional (3D) spheroids of HeLa cells were established for the evaluation of localization of the DOX-loaded nanoparticles into spheroids cells and the successfully inhibition of 3D tumor spheroid growth. The results indicated that the synthesized material Bi(mPEG–SeSe)-PCL was biocompatible and it could be a potential candidate for anticancer drug delivery system. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biocompatibility; Biological materials; Block copolymers; Calcium compounds; Chlorine compounds; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Diseases; Drug products; Ethylene glycol; Lanthanum compounds; Nanoparticles; Polyethylene glycols; Polyols; Selenium compounds; Sodium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Targeted drug delivery; 3D-Spheroids; Amphiphilic triblock copolymers; Anti-cancer drug delivery; Diselenide; Intracellular drug delivery; Polycaprolactone diols; Redox-responsive; Threedimensional (3-d); Synthesis (chemical)"
"Reduction of lipid contamination in MR spectroscopy imaging using signal space projection",2019,"Purpose: Lipid contamination can complicate the metabolite quantification in MR spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). In addition to various experimental methods demonstrated to be feasible for lipid suppression, the postprocessing method is beneficial in the flexibility of applications. In this study, the signal space projection (SSP) algorithm is proposed to suppress the lipid signal in the MRSI. Methods: The performance of lipid suppression using SSP and SSP combined with the Papoulis-Gerchberg (PG) algorithm (PG+SSP) is examined in 2D MRSI data and the results were compared with outer volume saturation (OVS) methods. Up to 10 lipid spatial components were extracted by SSP from lipid signals in the range of 0.8~1.5 ppm. Results: Our results show that most lipid signals were found in the first 4 to 5 components and that lipid signals on the spectra can be suppressed using 4 to 5 components. Metabolites concentrations were quantified using LCModel. Two regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected on the peripheral and inner brain regions. The quantification of metabolites in terms of fitting reliability (CRLB) and spatial variations within ROIs (SpaVar) is improved using SSP. When 5 to 6 components were used in SSP and PG+SSP, the metabolite concentrations and the associated SpaVar and CRLB are at the same level as those from the OVS. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the SSP method can be used to suppress the lipid signals of MRSI and SSP with 5 to 6 components is suggested to have a similar suppression performance as the OVS method. ? 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine","lipid; algorithm; Article; comparative study; contamination; controlled study; human; image analysis; image processing; mathematical computing; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Papoulis Gerchberg algorithm; performance; radiological parameters; signal noise ratio; signal space projection algorithm; voxel based morphometry"
"Cellulose binding domain fusion enhanced soluble expression of fructosyl peptide oxidase and its simultaneous purification and immobilization",2019,"Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is a hemoglobin molecule in which the N-terminal valine residue of the β subunit has been grafted with the glucose in blood. Its detection has important implications for the diagnosis of diabetes. Enzymatic colorimetric method using fructosyl peptide oxidase (FPO) is simple and rapid for HbA1c detection. A FPO mutant with enhanced activity was constructed and produced by E. coli; however, most of expressed mutant FPO was insoluble. Significantly enhanced expression solubility was achieved when cellulose-binding domain (CBD) from Clostridium thermocellum was fused to the N-terminal of FPO mutant. Via the high affinity interaction between CBD and cellulose, the CBD fusion also facilitated the simultaneous purification and immobilization of FPO directly from E. coli cells lysate using bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibrils as a matrix of very high specific area. A never-dried and water durable nanocellulose film with FPO activity could be easily obtained by collecting the FPO immobilized BC nanofibrils suspension on the surface of a microfiltration membrane. The activity of the ready-use FPO nanocellulose film was stable at least 7 days at room temperature for the detection of HbA1c level of 5.3–11% in blood samples. ? 2019","cellulose derivative; fructosyl peptide oxidase; hemoglobin A1c; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; cellulose; fructosyl-peptide oxidase; fusion protein; glycosylated hemoglobin; hemoglobin A1c protein, human; immobilized enzyme; oxidoreductase; amino terminal sequence; Article; bacterial cell; binding affinity; blood sampling; Clostridium thermocellum; colorimetry; enzyme activity; enzyme binding; enzyme immobilization; enzyme purification; Escherichia coli; microfiltration; nonhuman; protein expression; chemistry; gene expression; genetic procedures; genetics; human; isolation and purification; metabolism; mutation; protein domain; Amino Acid Oxidoreductases; Biosensing Techniques; Cellulose; Clostridium thermocellum; Enzymes, Immobilized; Escherichia coli; Gene Expression; Glycated Hemoglobin A; Humans; Mutation; Protein Domains; Recombinant Fusion Proteins"
"Nanodiamond-supported silver nanoparticles as potent and safe antibacterial agents",2019,"Since its discovery nearly a century ago, antibiotics has been one of the most effective methods in treating infectious diseases and limiting pathogen spread. However, pathogens often build up antibiotic resistance over time, leading to serious failure of the treatment. Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) is an appealing alternative, but successful treatment of the bacterial infection requires a plentiful supply of AgNP, which can negatively impact human health if people are excessively exposed to the particles. Here, we present a method to overcome this challenge by synthesizing nanodiamond-supported AgNP noncovalently conjugated with albumin molecules to achieve enhanced antibacterial activity and strengthened biocompatibility. Using Escherichia coli as a model bacterium, we found that the albumin-conjugated silver-diamond nanohybrids showed a long-term bactericidal effect after 36 days of the treatment at the AgNP concentration of 250 ?g mL?1. Moreover, the toxicity of the nanohybrids to human cells (including human fibroblasts, lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, and breast adenocarcinoma cells) is low even at the particle concentration of 500 ?g mL?1. The method provides a general and practical solution to the concerns of bacterial resistance against AgNP and issues associated with the size, shape, aggregation, and toxicity of AgNP are largely resolved. Finally, we demonstrate that the nanohybrids can be readily incorporated into natural polysaccharides (such as guar gum) to form three-in-one hydrogels, showing promising applications in nanomedicine. ? 2019, The Author(s).",""
"Bovine Serum Albumin-Templated Synthesis of Manganese-Doped Copper Selenide Nanoparticles for Boosting Targeted Delivery and Synergistic Photothermal and Photodynamic Therapy",2019,"Multifunctional nanohybrids integrating diagnostic imaging with photodynamic or photothermal therapy in a single agent feature the next generation of on-demand nanomedicine to meet the challenges in cancer therapy. In the present study, bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein through one pot biomimetic mineralization at its metal binding site synthesized and stabilized manganese-doped copper selenide nanoparticles (Mn:CuSe) with excellent biocompatibility, near-infrared absorption, water solubility, and rich functional groups for further bioconjugation. Mn doping not only imparted the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) function to the Mn:CuSe@BSA but also enhanced its heat generation ability. By taking advantage of BSA's extraordinary ligand binding capacity, folic acid (FA) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) were then conjugated onto the BSA corona to construct the Mn:CuSe@BSA-FA-Ce6 nanohybrid for specific targeting of overexpressed folate receptor cancer cells. The obtained theranostic agent exhibited dual MRI signal enhancement and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) effect, which was demonstrated in vitro on HeLa cells. As a consequence, dual modal therapy with 1 min PDT laser irradiation doubled cell killing efficiency compared to the single PDT treatment. Having better efficacy regarding biocompatibility and synergistic light-activation therapy, the Mn:CuSe@BSA-FA-Ce6 nanohybrid holds the promise for image-guided cancer therapy. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.","Biocompatibility; Biomimetics; Biosynthesis; Copper compounds; Diseases; Infrared devices; Lanthanum compounds; Light absorption; Magnetic resonance imaging; Mammals; Manganese compounds; Manganese removal (water treatment); Medical nanotechnology; Metal nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Oncology; Signal systems; Surface plasmon resonance; Water absorption; Biomimetic mineralization; Bovine serum albumin proteins (BSA); Bovine serum albumins; Copper selenide; Ligand binding capacity; Near-infrared absorption; Photothermal therapy; Templated synthesis; Photodynamic therapy"

"Large-area blade-coated organic solar cells processed from halogen-free solvent",2019,"High performance organic solar cells (OSCs) are generally prepared by halogenated solvents, which are detrimental to the environment and human health. The replacement of hazardous halogenated solvents is a priority in the commercialization of solution-processed OSCs. In this study, poly[4,8?bis(5?(2?ethylhexyl)thiophen?2?yl)benzo[1,2?b;4,5?b’]dithiophene?2,6?diyl?alt?(4?(2?ethylhexyl)?3?fluorothieno[3,4?b]thiophene?)?2?carboxylate?2?6-diyl)] (PBDTTT?EFT):[6,6]-phenyl C71-butyric acid methyl ester (PC71BM)-based device processed with binary halogen-free solvents (toluene and N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone) is fabricated by blade-coating method. Through the combination of morphological manipulation of active layer and interfacial engineering, the resulting OSCs deliver a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.09%. Importantly, large-area (216 cm2) blade-coated bulk-heterojunction OSCs is also demonstrated, and the resulting devices deliver a high PCE up to 5.03%, which is comparable to those of the devices processed with halogenated solvents (PCE = 5.20%). Additionally, the devices processed with halogen-free solvents also exhibit superior stability, maintaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 3960 h of continuous operation. More encouragingly, halogen-free solvents-based manufacturing process can also be performed under ambient conditions, and a moderate PCE of 3.67% is attained for large-area (216 cm2) OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 3.67% represents the highest efficiency ever reported for air-processed large-area OSCs.

"Reliability of a stochastic intermodal logistics network under spoilage and time considerations",2019,"In an intermodal logistics network, there is a carrier along each route whose capacity (number of available containers) is stochastic because the containers may be occupied by other customers. Hence this paper focuses on single commodity in a stochastic intermodal logistics network (SILN) with cargo terminals, transit stations, and routes. In particular, commodities may rot or be spoilt during delivery due to traffic accidents, collisions, natural disasters, weather, etc., and thus the intact commodities may not satisfy the market demand. The arrival time at the cargo terminal should be in the time window which is the interval between the earliest and latest acceptable arrival times. The delivery time depends on the number of containers and type of vehicle. So we propose an algorithm to evaluate the network reliability, the probability that the SILN can successfully deliver sufficient amount of commodity to meet market demand under the time and delivery spoilage constraints. Finally, a practical case of starting motor distribution between Taiwan and China is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",""
"Developing a health risk evaluation method for triple H",2019,"The development of a health evaluation system from human-related data is an important issue in preventive medicine. Previously, most studies have focused on disease assessment and prevention in patients. However, even if certain risk factors are all within normal ranges, individuals may not necessarily be completely healthy. This study focused on healthy individuals to develop a new index to assess health risks; this index can be used for the prevention of multiple diseases in healthy people. The kernel density technique was proposed to estimate the distribution of common risk factors and to develop a health risk index. A dataset of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia (Triple H) data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan was used to demonstrate the proposed analytical process. The results of risk factor changes after six weeks of exercise were used to calculate the health risk index. The results showed that the subjects experienced a 7.29% reduction in their health risk index after the exercise intervention. This finding demonstrates the potential impact of an important reference index on quantifying the effect of maintenance in healthy people. ? 2019 by the authors.

"Single step and mask-free 3D wax printing of microfluidic paper-based analytical devices for glucose and nitrite assays",2019,"Microfluidic paper-based analytical devices (μPADs) have recently emerged as a simple, portable, user-friendly, and affordable alternative to more instrument-intensive analytical approaches for point-of-care testing (POCT), food safety analysis, and environmental monitoring. However, most of the existing methods for the fabrication of μPADs still face a great challenge because of different trade-offs among cost, convenience, and the pattern resolution. In this work, we report a facile one-step approach to prepare a μPAD using an affordable, easy-to-build 3D printer to generate patterns of solid wax on laboratory filter paper. The presented wax printing method did not require the use of predesigned masks and an external heat source to form complete hydrophobic wax barrier through the use of a custom-made extruder. The results revealed a strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.985) between the nominal and the printed widths of the wax barriers. The achievable resolution of the wax barrier printed on filter paper was 468 ± 72 ?m, which was lower than previously reported minimum barrier feature sizes achieved by wax printing and other wax patterning techniques, such as stamping and screen-printing. The analytical utility of the fabricated μPADs was evaluated for colorimetric nitrite and glucose detection in artificial solutions. It was found that the fabricated μPADs provided adequate accuracy and reproducibility for quantitative determination of nitrite and glucose within concentration ranges relevant to the disease detection in human saliva and urine. The wax printing approach reported here provides a simple, rapid, and cost-effective fabrication method for paper-based microfluidics and may bring benefits to medical diagnostics in the developing world. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Analytic equipment; Body fluids; Colorimetry; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Economic and social effects; Fabrication; Glucose; Instrument testing; Microfluidics; Paper; Safety testing; Screen printing; 3-D printing; Colorimetric assays; Cost-effective fabrication; Low cost fabrication; Micro-fluidic devices; Paper-based analytical devices; Paper-based microfluidics; Quantitative determinations; 3D printers; glucose; nitrite; wax; chemistry; colorimetry; devices; lab on a chip; paper; three dimensional printing; Colorimetry; Glucose; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Nitrites; Paper; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Waxes"
"BIM-based AR maintenance system (BARMS) as an intelligent instruction platform for complex plumbing facilities",2019,"The traditional architectural design of facilities requires that maintenance workers refer between plumbing layout drawings and the actual facilities in complex, hidden, sealed in-wall, or low illumination environments.

An intelligent instruction framework was built considering subject, path, and actions. Challenges and solutions were created to monitor the subject and maintenance protocol while moving from inside to outside, between bright and dark environments, and when crossing building enclosures at roof level. Animated instruction using AR was interactive and followed the knowledge and management protocols of associated instruction aids. The results demonstrated a straightforward mapping of in-wall pipes and their connected valves, with practical auxiliary components of walking direction and path guidance.

"Nifedipine modulates renal lipogenesis via the ampk-srebp transcriptional pathway",2019,"Lipid accumulation in renal cells has been implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity-related kidney disease, and lipotoxicity in the kidney can be a surrogate marker for renal failure or renal fibrosis. Fatty acid oxidation provides energy to renal tubular cells. Ca2+ is required for mitochondrial ATP production and to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, how nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) affects lipogenesis is unknown. We utilized rat NRK52E cells pre-treated with varying concentrations of nifedipine to examine the activity of lipogenesis enzymes and lipotoxicity. A positive control exposed to oleic acid was used for comparison. Nifedipine was found to activate acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, long chain fatty acyl CoA elongase, ATP-citrate lyase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, suggesting elevated production of cholesterol and phospholipids. Nifedipine exposure induced a vast accumulation of cytosolic free fatty acids (FFA) and stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species, upregulated CD36 and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) expression, inhibited p-AMPK activity, and triggered the expression of SREBP-1/2 and lipin-1, underscoring the potential of nifedipine to induce lipotoxicity with renal damage. To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating nifedipine-induced lipid accumulation in the kidney. ? 2019 by the authors.

"A novel Sb-doped Mo(O,S)3 oxy-sulfide photocatalyst for degradation of methylene blue dye under visible light irradiation",2019,"Environmentally toxic methylene blue organic pollutants are of more concerns due to their antagonistic effects on human health, animals, and plants, thus needs serious attention for their removal. For elimination purpose, the Sb-doped Mo(O,S)3 oxy-sulfide nanoplate catalyst with different Sb contents was synthesized at low temperature of 95 °C via a facile method. The structural, morphological, chemical composition, optical properties, and electrical conductivity of the catalyst were characterized with different techniques. The photocatalytic performance of Sb-Mo(O,S)3 at various Sb contents was investigated for the degradation of methylene blue dye under visible light irradiation using hydrogen peroxide as an effective electron scavenger to further accelerate the reaction. It was observed that the incorporation of Sb enhanced the catalytic activity. Sb-Mo(O,S)3-10 was the most efficient catalyst with excellent activity to degrade 99.7% of the dye within 60 min irradiation time. The degradation kinetics follows a pseudo-first-order reaction with a rate constant 8.78 × 10?2 min?1, which is 3-fold higher than that for Sb- Mo(O,S)3-0 catalyst. Sb-Mo(O,S)3-10 showed slower recombination of photogenerated charge carriers and lower charge transfer resistance which proved to be capable for the removal of toxic methylene blue organic pollutant. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Antimony; Aromatic compounds; Catalyst activity; Charge transfer; Degradation; Irradiation; Light; Nanocatalysts; Optical properties; Photocatalysts; Photocatalytic activity; Photodegradation; Rate constants; Sulfur compounds; Temperature; Charge transfer resistance; Chemical compositions; Electrical conductivity; Methylene Blue; Photocatalytic performance; Photogenerated charge carriers; Pseudo-first order reactions; Visible-light irradiation; Organic pollutants"
"Interactions between HIV-1 protease, silver nanoparticles, and specific peptides",2019,"Use of silver nanoparticles (Ag NP's) as inhibitor for HIV-1 protease (PR) has practical interest. However, the interactions between the Ag NP's, HIV-1 PR, and the target peptides are not well demonstrated. This study experimentally revealed the interactions of the synthesized Ag NP's, HIV-1 PR, and five specific peptides with similar amino acid sequences to HIV's polyproteins. The Ag NP's can bind with either HIV-1 PR or the peptides. Incubating Ag NP's with peptide for 24 h can efficiently inhibit activity of HIV-1 PR. But HIV-1 PR would cleave peptides faster than the binding rate of Ag NP's and the peptides; therefore, late presence of Ag NP's would have no inhibition on the HIV-1 PR activity. ? 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers","Enzyme inhibition; Metal nanoparticles; Peptides; Amino acid sequence; Binding rate; Cleavage; HIV-1 protease; Polyproteins; Silver nanoparticles"
"Observational study of a new strategy and management policy for measles prevention in medical personnel in a hospital setting",2019,"Background: At the end of March 2018, a clustered outbreak of measles associated with health care workers occurred in northern Taiwan. Prior to this study, the policy for measles vaccination for physicians and nurses in MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan was encouragement of vaccination in medical personnel working in the emergency room or other high risk divisions without prior testing for measles antibody, and vaccination coverage was only 85.3%. It was important to urgently formulate a new strategy to achieve zero tolerance for intra-hospital transmission and epidemic prevention. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a new strategy for the prevention of an outbreak of measles. Methods: This study was conducted from April 23, 2018 to May 22, 2018 in the MacKay Memorial Hospital, a medical center and tertiary teaching hospital with 2200 beds in northern Taiwan. First-line medical personnel in the hospital underwent a free screening for measles antibody as a new strategy for measles outbreak prevention. Susceptible medical personnel were advised to receive measles vaccination. Results: A total of 719 first-line medical personnel were enrolled for the general survey. Measles seropositivity was 76.1% (287/377) in the generation born after 1978 (vaccinated), and 96.5% (330/342) in the generation born before 1978 (p < 0.001), while the overall seropositivity was 85.8% (617/719). Vaccination coverage of susceptible personnel under the new strategy reached 86.3% in the first month (88/102) following the survey. At the end of the first month after implementation of the new strategy, 98.1% of the medical personnel were seropositive or revaccinated, and reached 99.4% at the end of the second month. Conclusions: In this study, rapid, free antibody screening during a measles outbreak and subsequent vaccination of those susceptible resulted in most of the first-line medical personnel being seropositive or revaccinated. The new strategy was effective, time saving, used little manpower, and of low cost. Screening for measles antibody free of charge followed by vaccination of seronegative medical personnel can be regarded as an effective health management strategy to reduce and prevent the spread of measles infection. ? 2019 The Author(s).","measles antibody; measles vaccine; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; epidemic; hospital personnel; hospital physician; hospital policy; human; infection prevention; infection sensitivity; major clinical study; measles; nurse; observational study; protocol compliance; revaccination; screening; Taiwan; teaching hospital; tertiary care center; vaccination coverage; cross infection; epidemic; female; health care personnel; health care policy; infection control; male; measles; middle aged; organization and management; pregnancy; procedures; questionnaire; standards; statistics and numerical data; vaccination; vaccination coverage; young adult; Adult; Aged; Cross Infection; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Personnel; Health Policy; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Measles; Measles Vaccine; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Tertiary Care Centers; Vaccination; Vaccination Coverage; Young Adult"
"Combining Photogrammetry and Virtual Reality for Exploration of Otanaha Fortress Heritage of Indonesia",2019,"Mobile virtual reality has gained new interest amongst the industry and researchers. Along the development, Virtual Reality continues to be used for visualizing Heritage Sites. Virtual Reality can bring users feels like in a physical location without limits of location and time. The experience to explore the virtual world depends on the quality of the virtual environment and how to navigate in the virtual world. Researchers race to make the virtual environment more realistic with a variety of techniques and methods. The more realistic the environment and the more natural the way to explore, the deeper experience immerse the user. In this research we did photogrammetry experiment using Drone camera and handheld camera for heritage site 3D reconstruction. We describe the technique to capture and produce a 3D realistic model. This study discusses the data acquisition model, and the tools we used. This research utilizes accelerometer and gyroscope provided by smartphone sensors to detect running and jumping motions. Users can move in a virtual world simply by standing and walking in place. The result of this system can provide a realistic view and natural interaction that becomes an innovation to enhances the experience of exploring the virtual world for Heritage sites. ? 2018 IEEE.","3D modeling; Accelerometers; Cameras; Data acquisition; Image reconstruction; Photogrammetry; Walking aids; 3d realistic modeling; 3D reconstruction; Acquisition models; component; Heritage sites; Natural interactions; Physical locations; Walking-in-place; Virtual reality"
"Biodegradable redox-sensitive star polymer nanomicelles for enhancing doxorubicin delivery",2019,"A typical amphiphilic star polymer adamantane-[poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)- bis(2-carboxyethyl) sulfide-poly(ethylene glycol) monomethyl ether)] 4 with a specific hydrophilic/redox-sensitive/hydrophobic structure was designed and synthesized through ring opening and esterification reactions. The self-assembled nanomicelles were used as doxorubicin (DOX) delivery vehicles with suitable critical micelle concentrations (5.0 mg/L). After the drug being loaded, drug-loaded micelles showed good drug-loading efficiency (10.39%), encapsulation efficiency (58.1%), and drug release (up to 60%) under simulated biological environment conditions. In addition, the backbone structure of the biodegradable polymer was easily hydrolyzed by the action of biological enzymes. As expected, cell-based studies showed that the designed polymer micelles possessed good biocompatibility (a survival rate of 85% for NH-3T3 cells). Moreover, the drug (DOX) still maintained good anti-cancer effects after being loaded, which caused 40% of MCF-7 cells to survive. These redox-sensitive micelles showed anti-tumor therapeutic potential. ? 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.",""
"Sonochemical-assisted green synthesis of nitrogen-doped carbon dots from crab shell as targeted nanoprobes for cell imaging",2019,"A one-pot sonochemical method was developed for the green synthesis of highly fluorescent carbon dots with nitrogen dopants (N@C-dots) derived from crab shells. The synthesized N@C-dots exhibited excellent water solubility with a fluorescence quantum yield of 14.5%. The N@C-dots then conjugated with folic acid (FA) to construct the N@C-dots-FA nanoprobe with the ability to selectively target folate-receptor positive cancer cells. Moreover, in vitro cytotoxicity studies showed excellent biocompatibility. Cellular uptake of the N@C-dots-FA was further studied via in vitro confocal microscopy studies. Results showed that N@C-dots-FA nanoprobes were mostly localized in the cytoplasm of the folate receptor-overexpressing Human cervical cancer cell (HeLa) while cellular uptake by human embryo lung cell (HEL) cells (folate receptor-deficient control) was negligible. Based on their improved diagnostic imaging and enhanced targeting effect, the N@C-dots-FA probe has high potential in the theranostic applications. This study demonstrates an economically viable approach to synthesize N@C-dots-FA probe using seafood waste. ? 2018 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers","Anaerobic digestion; Biocompatibility; Carbon; Cytology; Diseases; Doping (additives); Fluorescence; Image processing; Lanthanum compounds; Nanoprobes; Nitrogen; Probes; Shellfish; Sonochemistry; Bio-waste; Cell imaging; Crab shells; Green synthesis; Sonochemical; Cells"

"Clonal relationship and the association of the ST218 strain harboring bla OXA-72 gene to mortality in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia",2019,"Background/purpose: In 2017, the World Health Organization categorized carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) as a priority 1, critical antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This study analyzed the clinical outcomes and investigated the molecular epidemiology of CRAB bacteremia in a medical center in Northern Taiwan. Methods: We collected 62 blood isolates from patients with CRAB bacteremia from January 2014 to December 2015 at MacKay Memorial Hospital and determined the clonal relationship using the PCR-based technique for molecular epidemiology. Medical charts were reviewed for clinical outcomes. Results: Fifty-six isolates harbored the bla OXA-51-like and bla OXA-23-like carbapenemase genes, 4 isolates harbor the bla OXA-51-like and bla OXA-24-like carbapenemase genes and 2 isolates harbored only the bla OXA-51-like gene. After sequencing, all four isolates of bla OXA-24-like carbapenemase gene were confirmed to be isolates of bla OXA-72 carbapenemase genes. In multivariate analysis in the 60 patients, the independent mortality risk factors of CRAB bacteremia included ?65 years (elderly) (Odds ratio, 4.04, 95% CI, 1.10–14.83, p = 0.035), chronic kidney disease (4.36, 1.14–16.72, p = 0.032). Isolates harboring the bla OXA-72 gene had the same sequence type (ST218) and PFGE pulsotype raising the possibility of intra-hospital transmission, and all infected patients died. Conclusion: This study showed the clonal relationship of isolates harboring the carbapenemase gene in CRAB bacteremia. Patients with the ST218 strain harboring bla OXA-72 gene had high mortality. This warrants further research to determine the mechanism of virulence and risk factors in order to reduce mortality. ? 2018","carbapenemase; colistin; imipenem; antiinfective agent; bacterial protein; beta lactamase; beta-lactamase OXA-23; beta-lactamase OXA-24; beta-lactamase OXA-51, Acinetobacter baumannii; carbapenem derivative; OXA-72 carbapenemase, Acinetobacter baumannii; virulence factor; Acinetobacter infection; adult; aged; antibiotic sensitivity; Article; artificial ventilation; bacteremia; bacterial gene; bacterial transmission; bacterial virulence; bacterium isolate; bla oxa 72 gene; blood culture; carbapenem resistance; carbapenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii; central venous catheterization; chronic kidney failure; clinical outcome; comorbidity; controlled study; coronary artery disease; diabetes mellitus; female; gene insertion sequence; healthcare associated infection; human; invasive procedure; liver cirrhosis; major clinical study; male; middle aged; minimum inhibitory concentration; molecular epidemiology; mortality rate; mortality risk; multilocus sequence typing; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; Taiwan; very elderly; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter infection; bacteremia; epidemiology; genetics; hospital; isolation and purification; microbial sensitivity test; microbiology; mortality; multidrug resistance; multivariate analysis; pathogenicity; risk factor; virulence; Acinetobacter baumannii; Acinetobacter Infections; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Anti-Bacterial Agents; Bacteremia; Bacterial Proteins; beta-Lactamases; Carbapenems; Drug Resistance, Multiple, Bacterial; Electrophoresis, Gel, Pulsed-Field; Female; Hospitals; Humans; Male; Microbial Sensitivity Tests; Molecular Epidemiology; Multilocus Sequence Typing; Multivariate Analysis; Risk Factors; Taiwan; Virulence; Virulence Factors"
"Does awareness of death strengthen awareness of self? The effects of existential threat on self-focus",2019,"Drawing on Kelly's (1955) personal construct theory, which suggests that human constructs typically contain their opposites. This study proposed that people facing death threat might be prompted to concern their existence, therefore pay more attentions on themselves. Two studies were conducted to explore the effects of death threat on self-focus. Study one analyzed data of six mortality salience experiments by using Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text analysis program. Study two was a case study analyzing a cancer patient’s writings. Both studies found that people use more first-person singular pronouns when reminded of their mortality. The results indicated that death threat increases self-focus. ? 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",""
"Managing “incidental findings” in biobank research: Recommendations of the Taiwan biobank",2019,"Background: In this article, incidental findings (IF) refer to unforeseen findings made possible through biobanking research and advances in medical diagnostic technologies that raise issues regarding the obligation and/or responsibility of biobank-users and biobanks to return clinically significant information to participants. The World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Taipei (2016) highlights the possibility of encountering IF and requires that research on biospecimens address biobank feedback policies in their informed consent process, leaving open the possibility that the policy may be “no return”. As clinicians and researchers begin to use these “resources”, the possibility of finding clinically significant IF is becoming a reality. Discussion: In line with the WMA's Declaration of Taipei, a pragmatic approach is needed to deal with the issue of returning IF in biobank governance. Indeed, the impacts and concerns associated with the return of IF differ across different stakeholder groups and jurisdictions. Therefore, the framework governing IF return needs to be custom-built, taking into account the nature of each research project and the unique features of biobanks. To this end, in addition to facilitating biobank transparency, establishing an endurable and horizontal connection among biobanks and clinical institutions under a public health system will improve efficiency and effectiveness. Hence, subject to contemporary Taiwanese ethical and/or legal regulations, this article argues for the establishment of an updated framework for imaging-related and genetic-related IF return within the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), mainly based on a limited obligation to disclose life-threatening information revealed by imaging, but not genetic, information. After discussing some of the ethical, legal and social issues encountered by the TWB and accounting for the experiences of other international biobanks, we propose a systematic framework for returning IF, mainly on a “limited obligation” basis, which offers better and more comprehensive protection for biobank-participants' rights and health. ? 2019 The Authors","Diagnosis; Philosophical aspects; Biobanks; Bioethics; Framework; Incidental findings; The WMA Declaration of Taipei (2016); Laws and legislation; adult; biobank; bioethics; clinician; human; incidental finding; informed consent; public health; responsibility; review; scientist; Taiwan"
"Enhanced self-efficacy and behavioral changes among patients with diabetes: Cloud-based mobile health platform and mobile app service",2019,"Background: The prevalence of chronic disease is increasing rapidly. Health promotion models have shifted toward patient-centered care and self-efficacy. Devices and mobile app in the Internet of Things (IoT) have become critical self-management tools for collecting and analyzing personal data to improve individual health outcomes. However, the precise effects of Web-based interventions on self-efficacy and the related motivation factors behind individuals' behavioral changes have not been determined. Objective: The objective of this study was to gain insight into patients' self-efficacy with newly diagnosed diabetes (type 2 diabetes mellitus) and analyze the association of patient-centered health promotion behavior and to examine the implications of the results for IoT and mobile health mobile app features. Methods: The study used data from the electronic health database (n=3128). An experimental design (n=121) and randomized controlled trials were employed to determine patient preferences in the health promotion program (n=62) and mobile self-management education (n=28). The transtheoretical model was used as a framework for observing self-management behavior for the improvement of individual health, and the theory of planned behavior was used to evaluate personal goals, execution, outcome, and personal preferences. A mobile app was used to determine individualized health promotion interventions and to apply these interventions to improve patients' self-management and self-efficacy. Results: Mobile questionnaires were administered for pre- and postintervention assessment through mobile app. A dynamic questionnaire allocation method was used to follow up and monitor patient behavioral changes in the subsequent 6 to 18 months. Participants at a high risk of problems related to blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ?120 mm Hg) and body mass index (?23 kg/m2) indicated high motivation to change and to achieve high scores in the self-care knowledge assessment (n=49, 95% CI -0.26% to -0.24%, P=.052). The associated clinical outcomes in the case group with the mobile-based intervention were slightly better than in the control group (glycated hemoglobin mean -1.25%, 95% CI 6.36 to 7.47, P=.002). In addition, 86% (42/49) of the participants improved their health knowledge through the mobile-based app and information and communications technology. The behavior-change compliance rate was higher among the women than among the men. In addition, the personal characteristics of steadiness and dominance corresponded with a higher compliance rate in the dietary and wellness intervention (83%, 81/98). Most participants (71%, 70/98) also increased their attention to healthy eating, being active, and monitoring their condition (30% 21/70, 21% 15/70, and 20% 14/70, respectively). Conclusions: The overall compliance rate was discovered to be higher after the mobile app-based health intervention. Various intervention strategies based on patient characteristics, health care-related word-of-mouth communication, and social media may be used to increase self-efficacy and improve clinical outcomes. Additional research should be conducted to determine the most influential factors and the most effective adherence management techniques. ? 2019 Dyna YP Chao, Tom MY Lin, Wen-Ya Ma.",""
"HapticSphere: Physical support to enable precision touch interaction in mobile mixed-reality",2019,"This work presents HapticSphere, a wearable spherical surface enabled by bridging a finger and the head-mounted display (HMD) with a passive string. Users perceive a physical support on a finger attached to a string, when extending their arm and reaching out to the string's maximum extension. This physical support assists users in precise touch interaction in the context of stationary and walking virtual or mixed-reality experiences. We propose three methods of attachment of the haptic string (directly on the head or on the body), and illustrate a novel single-step calibration algorithm that supports these configurations by estimating a grand haptic sphere, once a head-coordinated touch interaction is established. Two user studies were conducted to validate our approach and to compare the touch performance with physical support in sitting and walking conditions in the context of mobile mixed-reality scenarios. The results show that, in the walking condition, touch interaction with physical support significantly outperformed the visual-only condition. ? 2019 IEEE.","Flow visualization; Helmet mounted displays; Human computer interaction; User interfaces; Visualization; Walking aids; Wearable technology; Centered computing; Human; Tree-maps; Visualization designs; Visualization technique; Mixed reality"

"Pluronic F127 self-assembled MoS2 nanocomposites as an effective glutathione responsive anticancer drug delivery system",2019,"In this study, bio-responsive polymeric MoS2 nanocomposites were prepared for use as a drug carrier for cancer therapy. Herein, we report the synthesis and demonstrate the self-assembly of pluronic F127 (PF127) on a cystamine-glutathione-MoS2 (CYS-GSH-MoS2) system, which can be used for GSH-triggered drug release under biological reducing conditions. The reduction-sensitive disulfide bond containing CYS was incorporated between the amphiphilic copolymer PF127 and GSH-MoS2 to achieve feasible drug release. Percent drug loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency were 51.3% and 56%, respectively. In addition, when the MoS2-GSH-CYS-PF127 nanocomposite was incubated in a GSH environment, the morphology of the nanocomposite tended to change, ultimately leading to drug release. The drug-loaded PF127-CYS-GSH-MoS2 polymeric nanocomposites efficiently released 52% of their drug content after 72 h of incubation in a GSH reduction environment. The HeLa cells treated with DOX loaded MoS2-GSH-CYS-PF127 showed 38% toxicity at drug concentration of 40 μg, which indicated that the successfully released of drug from carrier and caused the cell death. Further, fluorescence microscopy images of HeLa cells revealed the potential behavior of the MoS2-GSH-CYS-PF12 nanocomposite during the 2- A nd 4 h incubation periods; the nanocomposite was only found in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Interestingly, after 6 h of incubation, the drug was slowly released from the nanocomposite and could enter the nucleus as confirmed by fluorescence imaging of HeLa cells. Altogether, our synthesized PF127-coated MoS2 nanocomposite could be effectively adopted in the near future as a GSH-sensitive drug carrier. This journal is ?
