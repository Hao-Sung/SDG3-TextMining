The aim of this research was to develop a larynx tumor detection system that could accurately mark the position of a tumor. In the laryngoscope images, the glottis and epiglottis images have apparent geometric and brightness features for image segmentation. According to the relevant positions of the two regions, the laryngeal part of the pharynx is divided into the radix linguae, hypopharynx, epiglottis, and glottis regions for marking the tumor. It could be adapted in laryngoscope images and effectively segmented the tumor contour in different locations. The tumor-correlated image processing procedure could then be implemented, and the tumor contour could be segmented. This study analyzed video laryngoscope data from 359 confirmed laryngeal cancer films, and the methods used were centered on image color space conversion, image enhancement, threshold selection, region-based segmentation, and dynamic information-based segmentation. This study demonstrated that the proposed system is a powerful tool for video laryngoscope analysis, especially for small and easily unnoticed tumors. The system identified and marked laryngeal tumors instantly and automatically with an accuracy of 97%. Overall, the system could ease and speed up the process of tumor detection as well as minimize the possibility of ENT doctors missing small or early-stage tumors. By being able to give timely and opportune treatment, patient quality of life could be improved. ? 2019",Color space conversion; Dynamic information-based segmentation; Image enhancement; Region-based segmentation; Threshold selection; Video laryngoscope,Cartilage; Color; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Patient treatment; Tumors; Video signal processing; Color space conversion; Dynamic information; Region-based segmentation; Threshold selection; Video laryngoscope; Color image processing; Article; cancer diagnosis; epiglottis tumor; glottis tumor; human; hypopharynx tumor; image processing; larynx tumor; priority journal; radix linguae tumor,2-s2.0-85071469006

However, pathogens often build up antibiotic resistance over time, leading to serious failure of the treatment. Silver nanoparticle (AgNP) is an appealing alternative, but successful treatment of the bacterial infection requires a plentiful supply of AgNP, which can negatively impact human health if people are excessively exposed to the particles. Here, we present a method to overcome this challenge by synthesizing nanodiamond-supported AgNP noncovalently conjugated with albumin molecules to achieve enhanced antibacterial activity and strengthened biocompatibility. Using Escherichia coli as a model bacterium, we found that the albumin-conjugated silver-diamond nanohybrids showed a long-term bactericidal effect after 36 days of the treatment at the AgNP concentration of 250 ?g mL?1. Moreover, the toxicity of the nanohybrids to human cells (including human fibroblasts, lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells, and breast adenocarcinoma cells) is low even at the particle concentration of 500 ?g mL?1. The method provides a general and practical solution to the concerns of bacterial resistance against AgNP and issues associated with the size, shape, aggregation, and toxicity of AgNP are largely resolved. Finally, we demonstrate that the nanohybrids can be readily incorporated into natural polysaccharides (such as guar gum) to form three-in-one hydrogels, showing promising applications in nanomedicine. ? 2019, The Author(s).",,,2-s2.0-85072128576

Through the combination of morphological manipulation of active layer and interfacial engineering, the resulting OSCs deliver a promising power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 11.09%. Importantly, large-area (216 cm2) blade-coated bulk-heterojunction OSCs is also demonstrated, and the resulting devices deliver a high PCE up to 5.03%, which is comparable to those of the devices processed with halogenated solvents (PCE = 5.20%). Additionally, the devices processed with halogen-free solvents also exhibit superior stability, maintaining 88% of its initial efficiency after 3960 h of continuous operation. More encouragingly, halogen-free solvents-based manufacturing process can also be performed under ambient conditions, and a moderate PCE of 3.67% is attained for large-area (216 cm2) OSCs. To the best of our knowledge, 3.67% represents the highest efficiency ever reported for air-processed large-area OSCs.

Hence, its treatment via photocatalytic degradation is an important remediation method for the sake of a healthy environment. Herein, the V2O5-CeO2 nanocomposite catalysts were synthesized via a simple precipitation-thermal decomposition approach and used for the photodegradation of methylene blue in the presence of H2O2 as an effective electron scavenger under visible light illumination. The nanocomposite catalysts were systematically characterized to investigate the effects of V2O5 with the aids of X-ray, morphology, light absorption, catalytic activity, and charge transfer properties of the nanocomposite catalysts. The VC-2 nanocomposite prepared with NH4VO3:CeO2 molar ratios at 0.15:1 was found to be the best efficient catalyst where ?98% of methylene blue was degraded within 25 min irradiation time. From the kinetics analysis, its rate constant was found to be higher than those of the pure V2O5 and CeO2 catalysts by a factor of 12.0 and 13.5, respectively. The plausibly mechanistic elucidation of charge transfer and utilization of reactive species are conspicuous allegations of the combined effects of the nanocomposite catalyst, H2O2 sacrificial agent, and visible light for the photodegradation of the dye. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Electron scavenger; Methylene blue; Nanocomposite catalyst; Photodegradation; V2O5-CeO2,Aromatic compounds; Catalyst activity; Cerium oxide; Charge transfer; Decomposition; Light; Light absorption; Molar ratio; Nanocomposites; Photodegradation; Rate constants; Vanadium pentoxide; Charge transfer properties; Decomposition approach; Electron scavengers; Methylene Blue; Nanocomposite catalyst; Photo catalytic degradation; Photodegradation of methylene blue; V2O5-CeO2; Nanocatalysts; cerium oxide nanoparticle; methylene blue; nanocomposite; vanadium; ceric oxide; cerium; hydrogen peroxide; methylene blue; nanocomposite; vanadium derivative; vanadium pentoxide; catalysis; catalyst; decomposition; degradation; dye; inorganic compound; light intensity; nanocomposite; photodegradation; reaction kinetics; Article; crystal structure; decomposition; ecosystem restoration; electron; electron diffraction; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; field emission scanning electron microscopy; impedance spectroscopy; irradiation; kinetics; light; near infrared spectroscopy; photocatalysis; photodegradation; photoluminescence; precipitation; Raman spectrometry; rate constant; surface property; synthesis; transmission electron microscopy; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; X ray; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; catalysis; chemistry; devices; illumination; light; metabolism; photolysis; radiation response; Catalysis; Cerium; Hydrogen Peroxide; Light; Lighting; Methylene Blue; Nanocomposites; Photolysis; Vanadium Compounds,2-s2.0-85068508835

Initially, ditosylated polycaprolactone was prepared via the reaction between polycaprolactone diol (PCL-diol) and tosyl chloride (TsCl). Next, Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL was synthesized via the reaction between ditosylated polycaprolactone and sodium diselenide initiated poly (ethylene glycol) methyl ether tosylate. The synthesized amphiphilic triblock copolymer could self-assemble into uniform nanoparticles in aqueous medium and disassemble upon redox stimuli. The Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL nanoparticles showed a DOX loading content of 5.1 wt% and a loading efficiency of 49%. In vitro drug release studies showed that about 62.4% and 56% of DOX was released from the nanoparticles during 72 h at 37 °C in PBS containing 2 mg/mL (6 mM) GSH and 0.1% H2O2, respectively, whereas only about 30% of DOX was released in PBS under the same conditions. The cell viability (MTT assays) results showed that the synthesized material was biocompatible with above 90% cell viability, and that the DOX-loaded Bi(mPEG-SeSe)-PCL nanoparticles had a high antitumor activity against HeLa cells and low antitumor activity against HaCaT cells, following a 24-h incubation period. Three-dimensional (3D) spheroids of HeLa cells were established for the evaluation of localization of the DOX-loaded nanoparticles into spheroids cells and the successfully inhibition of 3D tumor spheroid growth. The results indicated that the synthesized material Bi(mPEG–SeSe)-PCL was biocompatible and it could be a potential candidate for anticancer drug delivery system. ? 2019 Elsevier B.V.",3D-Spheroids; Diselenide bond; Nanoparticles; Redox-responsive,Biocompatibility; Biological materials; Block copolymers; Calcium compounds; Chlorine compounds; Controlled drug delivery; Cytology; Diseases; Drug products; Ethylene glycol; Lanthanum compounds; Nanoparticles; Polyethylene glycols; Polyols; Selenium compounds; Sodium compounds; Sulfur compounds; Targeted drug delivery; 3D-Spheroids; Amphiphilic triblock copolymers; Anti-cancer drug delivery; Diselenide; Intracellular drug delivery; Polycaprolactone diols; Redox-responsive; Threedimensional (3-d); Synthesis (chemical),2-s2.0-85067028962

The incidence of shigellosis showed significant seasonality, with the majority of cases occurring in summertime (for oscillation, P?<?.001). The number of shigellosis cases started to increase when temperatures reached 21°C (r?=?0.88, P?<?.001). Similarly, the number of shigellosis cases began to increase at a relative humidity of 70-74% (r?=?0.75, P?<?.005). The number of shigellosis cases was positively associated with the mean temperature and relative humidity in the period preceding the infection.

Acoustic structure quantification (ASQ), based on statistical analysis of ultrasound echoes, is an emerging technique for hepatic steatosis diagnosis. A standardized measurement protocol for ASQ analysis was suggested previously; however, an optimal ultrasound scanning approach has not been concluded thus far. In this study, the suitability of scanning approaches for the ASQ-based evaluation of hepatic steatosis was investigated. Hepatic fat fractions (HFFs; liver segments VIII, III and VI) of 70 living liver donors were assessed with magnetic resonance spectroscopy. A clinical ultrasound machine equipped with a 3-MHz convex transducer was used to scan each participant using the intercostal, epigastric and subcostal planes to acquire raw data for estimating two ASQ parameters (Cm 2 and focal disturbance [FD] ratio) of segments VIII, III and VI, respectively. The parameters were plotted as functions of the HFF for calculating the values of the correlation coefficient (r) and probability value (p). The diagnostic performance of the parameters in discriminating between the normal and steatotic (?5 and ?10%) groups was also compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The Cm 2 and FD ratio values measured using the epigastric and subcostal planes did not correlate with the severity of hepatic steatosis. However, intercostal imaging exhibited a higher correlation between the ASQ parameters and HFF (r = ?0.64, p &lt; 0.001). The diagnostic performance of Cm 2 and FD ratio in detecting hepatic steatosis using intercostal imaging was also satisfactory (areas under ROC curves &gt;0.8).

The CuFeS 2 nanocrystals were synthesized through a simple heating-up approach and transferred into an aqueous phase using BSA in an ultrasonic-assisted microemulsion method. The as-prepared CuFeS 2 @BSA nanoparticles further conjugated with folic acid (FA) followed by attachment of Ce6 to form the Ce6:CuFeS 2 @BSA-FA nanohybrid with improved solubility and strong near-infrared (NIR) absorbance and fluorescence. It is the first report to fabricate the targeted Ce6:CuFeS 2 @BSA-FA hybrid and evaluates their synergistic PTT/PDT effect using a single laser. The Ce6:CuFeS 2 @BSA-FA hybrid showed lower toxicity in vitro (HeLa and HepG2 cells) and in vivo (zebrafish embryos), while they are selectively recognized and internalized by HeLa cells that over-express folate receptors. Compared to each modality applied separately, the combined single-laser-induced PTT and PDT treatment showed the enhanced generation of heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS) with synergistic cancer killing under 671 nm laser irradiation (10 min, 1 W/cm 2 ).

A FPO mutant with enhanced activity was constructed and produced by E. coli; however, most of expressed mutant FPO was insoluble. Significantly enhanced expression solubility was achieved when cellulose-binding domain (CBD) from Clostridium thermocellum was fused to the N-terminal of FPO mutant. Via the high affinity interaction between CBD and cellulose, the CBD fusion also facilitated the simultaneous purification and immobilization of FPO directly from E. coli cells lysate using bacterial cellulose (BC) nanofibrils as a matrix of very high specific area.

Prior to this study, the policy for measles vaccination for physicians and nurses in MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan was encouragement of vaccination in medical personnel working in the emergency room or other high risk divisions without prior testing for measles antibody, and vaccination coverage was only 85.3%. It was important to urgently formulate a new strategy to achieve zero tolerance for intra-hospital transmission and epidemic prevention. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of a new strategy for the prevention of an outbreak of measles. Methods: This study was conducted from April 23, 2018 to May 22, 2018 in the MacKay Memorial Hospital, a medical center and tertiary teaching hospital with 2200 beds in northern Taiwan. First-line medical personnel in the hospital underwent a free screening for measles antibody as a new strategy for measles outbreak prevention. Susceptible medical personnel were advised to receive measles vaccination. Results: A total of 719 first-line medical personnel were enrolled for the general survey. Measles seropositivity was 76.1% (287/377) in the generation born after 1978 (vaccinated), and 96.5% (330/342) in the generation born before 1978 (p < 0.001), while the overall seropositivity was 85.8% (617/719). Vaccination coverage of susceptible personnel under the new strategy reached 86.3% in the first month (88/102) following the survey. At the end of the first month after implementation of the new strategy, 98.1% of the medical personnel were seropositive or revaccinated, and reached 99.4% at the end of the second month. Conclusions: In this study, rapid, free antibody screening during a measles outbreak and subsequent vaccination of those susceptible resulted in most of the first-line medical personnel being seropositive or revaccinated. The new strategy was effective, time saving, used little manpower, and of low cost. Screening for measles antibody free of charge followed by vaccination of seronegative medical personnel can be regarded as an effective health management strategy to reduce and prevent the spread of measles infection. ? 2019 The Author(s).",Measles prevention; Medical personnel; Seropositivity; Vaccination coverage,"measles antibody; measles vaccine; adult; aged; Article; controlled study; epidemic; hospital personnel; hospital physician; hospital policy; human; infection prevention; infection sensitivity; major clinical study; measles; nurse; observational study; protocol compliance; revaccination; screening; Taiwan; teaching hospital; tertiary care center; vaccination coverage; cross infection; epidemic; female; health care personnel; health care policy; infection control; male; measles; middle aged; organization and management; pregnancy; procedures; questionnaire; standards; statistics and numerical data; vaccination; vaccination coverage; young adult; Adult; Aged; Cross Infection; Disease Outbreaks; Female; Health Personnel; Health Policy; Hospitals, Teaching; Humans; Infection Control; Male; Measles; Measles Vaccine; Middle Aged; Pregnancy; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Tertiary Care Centers; Vaccination; Vaccination Coverage; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85068509165

In the present study, bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein through one pot biomimetic mineralization at its metal binding site synthesized and stabilized manganese-doped copper selenide nanoparticles (Mn:CuSe) with excellent biocompatibility, near-infrared absorption, water solubility, and rich functional groups for further bioconjugation. Mn doping not only imparted the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) function to the Mn:CuSe@BSA but also enhanced its heat generation ability. By taking advantage of BSA's extraordinary ligand binding capacity, folic acid (FA) and chlorin e6 (Ce6) were then conjugated onto the BSA corona to construct the Mn:CuSe@BSA-FA-Ce6 nanohybrid for specific targeting of overexpressed folate receptor cancer cells. The obtained theranostic agent exhibited dual MRI signal enhancement and synergistic photothermal/photodynamic therapy (PTT/PDT) effect, which was demonstrated in vitro on HeLa cells. As a consequence, dual modal therapy with 1 min PDT laser irradiation doubled cell killing efficiency compared to the single PDT treatment.

ADRs can lead to emergency room visits and hospitalization, straining healthcare resources and, thus, they have strong implications for public health. Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is one ADR and comprises the highest proportion of all drug relief cases in Taiwan. Pharmacovigilance involves the collection, detection, assessment, monitoring, and prevention of ADRs, including SJS. Most medical specialists are not fully aware of the risk of drug-induced SJS. Consequently, various drugs may be prescribed to susceptible patients for a great variety of diseases and, in turn, cause SJS. In this research, medical records of SJS patients were retrieved from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database, and the Generalized Sequential Patterns (GSP) algorithm was used to find the sequential patterns of diseases before SJS onset. Then we mined the sequential patterns of medications prescribed in each disease pattern. Afterwards, we detected significant associations of each pattern of diseases and medications prescribed among age groups with statistical analysis. We found that, first, most patients developed SJS after being prescribed the causative medications fewer than four times. Second, Respiratory System Diseases (RSDs) appeared in disease sequential patterns of all lengths. Patterns involving RSDs were more frequent than others. Third, NSAIDs, H2-antagonists for peptic ulcer, penicillin antibiotics, theophylline bronchodilators, and cephalosporin antibiotics were the most frequent medications prescribed. Fourth, we found that patients in certain age groups had higher risks of developing SJS. This study aimed to mine the sequential patterns of diseases contracted and medications prescribed before patients developed SJS in Taiwan. This useful information can be provided to physicians so that they can stop the administration of suspected drugs to avoid evolution towards more severe cases. ? 2019 by the authors.",Adverse drug reactions; Data mining; Healthcare; Sequential pattern mining; Stevens-Johnson Syndrome,,2-s2.0-85068111294

Hence this paper focuses on single commodity in a stochastic intermodal logistics network (SILN) with cargo terminals, transit stations, and routes. In particular, commodities may rot or be spoilt during delivery due to traffic accidents, collisions, natural disasters, weather, etc., and thus the intact commodities may not satisfy the market demand. The arrival time at the cargo terminal should be in the time window which is the interval between the earliest and latest acceptable arrival times. The delivery time depends on the number of containers and type of vehicle. So we propose an algorithm to evaluate the network reliability, the probability that the SILN can successfully deliver sufficient amount of commodity to meet market demand under the time and delivery spoilage constraints. Finally, a practical case of starting motor distribution between Taiwan and China is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Delivery spoilage; Network reliability; Stochastic intermodal logistics network (SILN); Time windows; Transit stations,,2-s2.0-85021797169

Their unique characteristics, such as extremely low critical micelle concentration, desirable micellar stability, well-controlled light-responsiveness, tailorable drug-loading content, and ultrasensitive light-induced drug release, make these micelles potential candidates for development of a more effective, safer drug delivery platform for cancer treatment. In vitro studies revealed that the drug-loaded micelles exhibited high structural stability in serum-containing media and very low toxicity toward normal and cancer cells under physiological conditions. Irradiation of cancer cells incubated with the drug-loaded micelles with ultraviolet light at 254 nm for only 10 s triggered rapid and complete release of the drug in the intracellular environment and induced strong antiproliferative/cytotoxic activity. Importantly, real-time cytotoxic assays and fluorescence imaging analysis further demonstrated that the drug-loaded micelles were rapidly taken up into the cytosol or nuclei of the cells, and subsequent ultraviolet exposure induced drug release and apoptotic cell death. Given their simplicity of design, high reliability, and performance, this new light-sensitive micelle may provide a promising route for developing a multifunctional therapeutic nanocarrier system. ? 2019 American Chemical Society.",controlled drug delivery; photoresponsive micelles; polymer assembly; real-time cytotoxicity assays; water-soluble functional block copolymer,Block copolymers; Cell death; Critical micelle concentration; Diseases; Fluorescence imaging; Functional polymers; Light sensitive materials; Micelles; Photosensitivity; Polyethylene glycols; Saline water; Stability; Synthesis (chemical); Targeted drug delivery; Cytotoxicity assays; Functional block copolymers; Micellar nanoparticles; Phosphate-buffered salines; Photo-responsive; Physiological condition; Polymer assemblies; Structural stabilities; Controlled drug delivery,2-s2.0-85068000052

Health promotion models have shifted toward patient-centered care and self-efficacy. Devices and mobile app in the Internet of Things (IoT) have become critical self-management tools for collecting and analyzing personal data to improve individual health outcomes. However, the precise effects of Web-based interventions on self-efficacy and the related motivation factors behind individuals' behavioral changes have not been determined. Objective: The objective of this study was to gain insight into patients' self-efficacy with newly diagnosed diabetes (type 2 diabetes mellitus) and analyze the association of patient-centered health promotion behavior and to examine the implications of the results for IoT and mobile health mobile app features. Methods: The study used data from the electronic health database (n=3128). An experimental design (n=121) and randomized controlled trials were employed to determine patient preferences in the health promotion program (n=62) and mobile self-management education (n=28). The transtheoretical model was used as a framework for observing self-management behavior for the improvement of individual health, and the theory of planned behavior was used to evaluate personal goals, execution, outcome, and personal preferences. A mobile app was used to determine individualized health promotion interventions and to apply these interventions to improve patients' self-management and self-efficacy. Results: Mobile questionnaires were administered for pre- and postintervention assessment through mobile app. A dynamic questionnaire allocation method was used to follow up and monitor patient behavioral changes in the subsequent 6 to 18 months. Participants at a high risk of problems related to blood pressure (systolic blood pressure ?120 mm Hg) and body mass index (?23 kg/m2) indicated high motivation to change and to achieve high scores in the self-care knowledge assessment (n=49, 95% CI -0.26% to -0.24%, P=.052). The associated clinical outcomes in the case group with the mobile-based intervention were slightly better than in the control group (glycated hemoglobin mean -1.25%, 95% CI 6.36 to 7.47, P=.002). In addition, 86% (42/49) of the participants improved their health knowledge through the mobile-based app and information and communications technology. The behavior-change compliance rate was higher among the women than among the men. In addition, the personal characteristics of steadiness and dominance corresponded with a higher compliance rate in the dietary and wellness intervention (83%, 81/98). Most participants (71%, 70/98) also increased their attention to healthy eating, being active, and monitoring their condition (30% 21/70, 21% 15/70, and 20% 14/70, respectively). Conclusions: The overall compliance rate was discovered to be higher after the mobile app-based health intervention. Various intervention strategies based on patient characteristics, health care-related word-of-mouth communication, and social media may be used to increase self-efficacy and improve clinical outcomes. Additional research should be conducted to determine the most influential factors and the most effective adherence management techniques. ? 2019 Dyna YP Chao, Tom MY Lin, Wen-Ya Ma.",Health literacy; Intervention; Patient engagement; Self-management; Type 2 diabetes mellitus; Word-of-mouth,,2-s2.0-85067259438

Moreover, the drug (DOX) still maintained good anti-cancer effects after being loaded, which caused 40% of MCF-7 cells to survive. These redox-sensitive micelles showed anti-tumor therapeutic potential. ? 2019 by the authors.

Previously, most studies have focused on disease assessment and prevention in patients. However, even if certain risk factors are all within normal ranges, individuals may not necessarily be completely healthy. This study focused on healthy individuals to develop a new index to assess health risks; this index can be used for the prevention of multiple diseases in healthy people. The kernel density technique was proposed to estimate the distribution of common risk factors and to develop a health risk index. A dataset of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and hyperglycemia (Triple H) data from the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan was used to demonstrate the proposed analytical process. The results of risk factor changes after six weeks of exercise were used to calculate the health risk index. The results showed that the subjects experienced a 7.29% reduction in their health risk index after the exercise intervention. This finding demonstrates the potential impact of an important reference index on quantifying the effect of maintenance in healthy people. ? 2019 by the authors.

Fatty acid oxidation provides energy to renal tubular cells. Ca2+ is required for mitochondrial ATP production and to decrease reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, how nifedipine (a calcium channel blocker) affects lipogenesis is unknown. We utilized rat NRK52E cells pre-treated with varying concentrations of nifedipine to examine the activity of lipogenesis enzymes and lipotoxicity. A positive control exposed to oleic acid was used for comparison. Nifedipine was found to activate acetyl Coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase, acetyl CoA carboxylase, long chain fatty acyl CoA elongase, ATP-citrate lyase, and 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) reductase, suggesting elevated production of cholesterol and phospholipids. Nifedipine exposure induced a vast accumulation of cytosolic free fatty acids (FFA) and stimulated the production of reactive oxygen species, upregulated CD36 and KIM-1 (kidney injury molecule-1) expression, inhibited p-AMPK activity, and triggered the expression of SREBP-1/2 and lipin-1, underscoring the potential of nifedipine to induce lipotoxicity with renal damage.

However, biobanks also face sustainability challenges comprising three dimensions - ""financial,"" ""operational,"" and ""social."" The Taiwan Biobank (TWB), as a large-scale national biobank that supplies valuable phenotypic and genetic information to biomedical researchers on an application basis to investigate the relationship among personal health, genes, lifestyle, environment and diseases of the Taiwanese population, has not been sufficiently explored by researchers. Although the TWB has successfully reached a few milestones since its inception, it faces many sustainability challenges. For the next chapter of the TWB, we propose three strategies to improve sustainability. First, the Ministry of Health and Welfare launched the TWB as an infrastructure project under the leadership of Academia Sinica in 2012. We now believe that it is time that the TWB is transformed into a legal entity as a nondepartmental public body. This would not only ensure efficient, effective, and flexible operation, but would also facilitate cooperation with commercial entities. Second, we suggest that the TWB integrates with other Taiwanese biobanks to reduce cost, improve low utilization, and expand specimen collection. Third, self-financing is important if funding is ceased. Besides implementing a cost-recovery model, the commodities developed by the TWB (e.g., TWB 2.0 microarray) will help increase income. After each of these strategies has been discussed in detail, this article will conclude by highlighting how these practices can help improve biobank sustainability. ? 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",biobank networks; commercialization; non-departmental public body; sustainability; Taiwan Biobank,Article; biobank; biotechnology; cost utility analysis; environmental sustainability; funding; human; international cooperation; leadership; priority journal; Taiwan; Taiwanese,2-s2.0-85064213986

Patients who are poor candidates for arteriovenous access creation require long-term catheter placement. Problems such as dialysate recirculation, thrombosis, catheter-related infections, and malfunction can occur with HD catheters. Different tip designs (step, split, and symmetrical) have been developed to ameliorate the catheter-related problems. The aim of the study was to compare the efficacy and safety of split-tip, step-tip, and symmetrical-tip HD catheters. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry were searched for studies published before November 2017. Studies comparing the clinical and rheologic outcomes of step-, split-, or symmetrical-tip catheters in patients undergoing HD were included in this meta-analysis. We conducted meta-analyses using random-effects models. The primary outcomes were catheter survival time and incidence of functioning catheters. The secondary outcomes were delivered blood flow rate, blood recirculation rate, and incidence of catheter-related complications. Results: Seven randomized controlled trials and one retrospective study with a total of 988 patients were included. No significant differences were observed in the delivered blood flow rate (weighted mean difference, ?5.37 mL/min; 95% confidence interval [CI], ?23.75 to 13.02), incidence of catheter-related infections (risk ratio [RR], 1.18; 95% CI, 0.63-2.22), or incidence of catheter-related thrombosis (RR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.64-2.59) between step-tip catheters and advanced (both split-tip and symmetrical-tip) catheters. Moreover, a meta-analysis of the incidence of functioning catheters at 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months revealed that the outcome of step-tip catheter use was better than that of split-tip catheter use, but with a significant difference only at 6 months (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02-1.46). Conclusions: None of the catheter types exhibited unique features that can enhance their suitability for application. Hence, catheters can be selected by also considering different factors, including costs, ease of procedures, expertise of the clinician, and education and preference of the patient. ? 2018 Society for Vascular Surgery",Blood flow rate; Catheter survival rate; Hemodialysis; Meta-analysis; Recirculation rate; Split-tip; Step-tip; Symmetrical-tip; Tunneled cuff catheters,"urokinase; blood flow velocity; catheter infection; catheter removal; catheter thrombosis; device safety; hemodialysis; human; meta analysis; overall survival; priority journal; Review; survival time; systematic review; treatment outcome; adolescent; adult; adverse event; aged; central venous catheter; central venous catheterization; chronic kidney failure; devices; equipment design; female; indwelling catheter; male; middle aged; risk factor; very elderly; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Catheterization, Central Venous; Catheters, Indwelling; Central Venous Catheters; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Middle Aged; Renal Dialysis; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85062852327

First, consumer characteristics such as the frequency of disabling injuries has positive impacts on the volume of medical services provided by TCM clinics. These results imply that people are likely to select TCM as the option for medical treatment when they face the occurrence of physical injury in Taiwan. In addition, the scale measurements for TCM clinics including the numbers of physicians, medical personnel and divisions have significantly positive effects on the performance of TCM clinics, while their survival length also has the same effect.

In the Ce6-HA-CIS nanohybrids, the CIS HS-rod was investigated as a PTT agent to convert light into thermal energy, with Ce6 acting as a PDT agent to generate singlet oxygen ( 1 O 2 ). HA encapsulated the surface of the CIS HS-rod and aided the hydrophobic CIS HS-rod in achieving aqueous solubility. HA also acts as a tumor-specific targeting vector of cancer cells bearing the cluster determinant 44 receptor. Under light irradiation, the fabricated Ce6-HA-CIS nanohybrids exhibited high photothermal conversion efficiency, good photo-stability, and satisfactory photodynamic activity. In vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that Ce6-HA-CIS showed low cytotoxicity and synergistic photodynamic and photothermal cancer cell killing effects as compared to PTT or PDT agents alone.

This study analyzed the clinical outcomes and investigated the molecular epidemiology of CRAB bacteremia in a medical center in Northern Taiwan. Methods: We collected 62 blood isolates from patients with CRAB bacteremia from January 2014 to December 2015 at MacKay Memorial Hospital and determined the clonal relationship using the PCR-based technique for molecular epidemiology. Medical charts were reviewed for clinical outcomes. Results: Fifty-six isolates harbored the bla OXA-51-like and bla OXA-23-like carbapenemase genes, 4 isolates harbor the bla OXA-51-like and bla OXA-24-like carbapenemase genes and 2 isolates harbored only the bla OXA-51-like gene. After sequencing, all four isolates of bla OXA-24-like carbapenemase gene were confirmed to be isolates of bla OXA-72 carbapenemase genes. In multivariate analysis in the 60 patients, the independent mortality risk factors of CRAB bacteremia included ?65 years (elderly) (Odds ratio, 4.04, 95% CI, 1.10–14.83, p = 0.035), chronic kidney disease (4.36, 1.14–16.72, p = 0.032). Isolates harboring the bla OXA-72 gene had the same sequence type (ST218) and PFGE pulsotype raising the possibility of intra-hospital transmission, and all infected patients died. Conclusion: This study showed the clonal relationship of isolates harboring the carbapenemase gene in CRAB bacteremia. Patients with the ST218 strain harboring bla OXA-72 gene had high mortality.

Estimating the expenditure for this disease has become an urgent concern of the supporting families, medial institutes, and government. In this study, a conditional Gaussian Bayesian network (CGBN) model was developed to incorporate the comprehensive risk factors to estimate the medical expenditure of a lung cancer patient at different stages. A total of 961 patients were surveyed by the four severity stages of lung cancer. The proposed CGBN model identified the correlation and association of 15 risk factors to the medical expenditure of different severity stages of lung cancer patients. The relationships among the demographic, diagnosed-based, and prior-utilization variables are constructed. The model predicted the lung cancer-related medical expenditure with high accuracy of 32.63%, 50.30%, 50.36%, and 66.58%, respectively for stages 1–4, as compared with the reported models. A greedy search was also applied to find the upper threshold of R 2 , while our model also shows that it approached the upper threshold. ? 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Conditional Gaussian Bayesian network; Lung cancer; Medical expenditure; Medical information analytics,Bayesian networks; Biological organs; Risk perception; Comprehensive risks; Different stages; Gaussian bayesian networks; Greedy search; High-accuracy; Lung Cancer; Medical expenditures; Medical information; Diseases; afatinib; bevacizumab; docetaxel; doxorubicin; erlotinib; etoposide; gefitinib; gemcitabine; paclitaxel; pemetrexed; vinorelbine tartrate; adult; Article; Bayes theorem; bronchiectasis; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer risk; cancer staging; cancer surgery; chronic disease; cohort analysis; controlled study; disease severity; emphysema; female; health care cost; human; hypertension; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; medical record review; middle aged; population research; priority journal; retrospective study; tuberculosis; validation process,2-s2.0-85060649323

However, most of the existing methods for the fabrication of μPADs still face a great challenge because of different trade-offs among cost, convenience, and the pattern resolution. In this work, we report a facile one-step approach to prepare a μPAD using an affordable, easy-to-build 3D printer to generate patterns of solid wax on laboratory filter paper. The presented wax printing method did not require the use of predesigned masks and an external heat source to form complete hydrophobic wax barrier through the use of a custom-made extruder. The results revealed a strong linear relationship (R2 = 0.985) between the nominal and the printed widths of the wax barriers. The achievable resolution of the wax barrier printed on filter paper was 468 ± 72 ?m, which was lower than previously reported minimum barrier feature sizes achieved by wax printing and other wax patterning techniques, such as stamping and screen-printing. The analytical utility of the fabricated μPADs was evaluated for colorimetric nitrite and glucose detection in artificial solutions. It was found that the fabricated μPADs provided adequate accuracy and reproducibility for quantitative determination of nitrite and glucose within concentration ranges relevant to the disease detection in human saliva and urine. The wax printing approach reported here provides a simple, rapid, and cost-effective fabrication method for paper-based microfluidics and may bring benefits to medical diagnostics in the developing world. ? 2018 Elsevier B.V.",3D printing; Colorimetric assays; Low-cost fabrication; Paper microfluidic devices; Periodontal diagnosis; Wax barrier,"Analytic equipment; Body fluids; Colorimetry; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Economic and social effects; Fabrication; Glucose; Instrument testing; Microfluidics; Paper; Safety testing; Screen printing; 3-D printing; Colorimetric assays; Cost-effective fabrication; Low cost fabrication; Micro-fluidic devices; Paper-based analytical devices; Paper-based microfluidics; Quantitative determinations; 3D printers; glucose; nitrite; wax; chemistry; colorimetry; devices; lab on a chip; paper; three dimensional printing; Colorimetry; Glucose; Lab-On-A-Chip Devices; Nitrites; Paper; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Waxes",2-s2.0-85056258834

In addition to various experimental methods demonstrated to be feasible for lipid suppression, the postprocessing method is beneficial in the flexibility of applications. In this study, the signal space projection (SSP) algorithm is proposed to suppress the lipid signal in the MRSI. Methods: The performance of lipid suppression using SSP and SSP combined with the Papoulis-Gerchberg (PG) algorithm (PG+SSP) is examined in 2D MRSI data and the results were compared with outer volume saturation (OVS) methods. Up to 10 lipid spatial components were extracted by SSP from lipid signals in the range of 0.8~1.5 ppm. Results: Our results show that most lipid signals were found in the first 4 to 5 components and that lipid signals on the spectra can be suppressed using 4 to 5 components. Metabolites concentrations were quantified using LCModel. Two regions of interest (ROIs) were manually selected on the peripheral and inner brain regions. The quantification of metabolites in terms of fitting reliability (CRLB) and spatial variations within ROIs (SpaVar) is improved using SSP. When 5 to 6 components were used in SSP and PG+SSP, the metabolite concentrations and the associated SpaVar and CRLB are at the same level as those from the OVS. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that the SSP method can be used to suppress the lipid signals of MRSI and SSP with 5 to 6 components is suggested to have a similar suppression performance as the OVS method. ? 2018 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine",lipid suppression; MR spectroscopic imaging; out volume saturation; Signal space projection,lipid; algorithm; Article; comparative study; contamination; controlled study; human; image analysis; image processing; mathematical computing; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Papoulis Gerchberg algorithm; performance; radiological parameters; signal noise ratio; signal space projection algorithm; voxel based morphometry,2-s2.0-85053392684

Effective monitoring of blood glucose can aid in maintaining the body's insulin level, and thus reduce disease severities, secondary complications, and related mortalities. However, existing blood glucose measurement devices are inconvenient to carry and involve complex procedures, reducing the willingness of diabetes patients to regularly measure blood glucose. We aim to provide a rapid, convenient, and portable meter for diabetes patients. We introduce an integrated blood glucose detection device (IBGDD) that has no electronic component and uses the optical sensing module of a smartphone to inspect colorimetric blood strips. To demonstrate accuracy conformance of the developed device to the ISO 15197:2013 standard for blood glucose measurement, 20 diabetes mellitus patients used the IBGDD with smartphones to measure their blood glucose level. The measurement results revealed an accuracy of 100%, completely satisfying the requirements of the ISO 15197:2013 standard. Overall, our specially designed IBGDD with a smartphone could achieve high accuracy and convenient usage for the measurement of blood glucose concentration. Furthermore, the device is highly portable and simple to operate. This contributes toward achieving self-monitoring of blood glucose by diabetes patients and improved mobile health in the future. ? 2019 The Authors.",blood glucose; colorimetric blood strip; diabetes; smartphone,Color; Colorimetric analysis; Colorimetry; Glucose; Insulin; ISO Standards; Medical problems; Smartphones; Surface plasmon resonance; Blood glucose; Blood glucose concentration; Blood glucose detection; Blood glucose measurements; colorimetric blood strip; Colorimetric detection; Feasibility analysis; Self-monitoring blood glucose; Blood,2-s2.0-85061958241

Herein, we report the synthesis and demonstrate the self-assembly of pluronic F127 (PF127) on a cystamine-glutathione-MoS2 (CYS-GSH-MoS2) system, which can be used for GSH-triggered drug release under biological reducing conditions. The reduction-sensitive disulfide bond containing CYS was incorporated between the amphiphilic copolymer PF127 and GSH-MoS2 to achieve feasible drug release. Percent drug loading capacity and encapsulation efficiency were 51.3% and 56%, respectively. In addition, when the MoS2-GSH-CYS-PF127 nanocomposite was incubated in a GSH environment, the morphology of the nanocomposite tended to change, ultimately leading to drug release. The drug-loaded PF127-CYS-GSH-MoS2 polymeric nanocomposites efficiently released 52% of their drug content after 72 h of incubation in a GSH reduction environment. The HeLa cells treated with DOX loaded MoS2-GSH-CYS-PF127 showed 38% toxicity at drug concentration of 40 μg, which indicated that the successfully released of drug from carrier and caused the cell death. Further, fluorescence microscopy images of HeLa cells revealed the potential behavior of the MoS2-GSH-CYS-PF12 nanocomposite during the 2- A nd 4 h incubation periods; the nanocomposite was only found in the cytoplasm of HeLa cells. Interestingly, after 6 h of incubation, the drug was slowly released from the nanocomposite and could enter the nucleus as confirmed by fluorescence imaging of HeLa cells.

The World Medical Association (WMA) Declaration of Taipei (2016) highlights the possibility of encountering IF and requires that research on biospecimens address biobank feedback policies in their informed consent process, leaving open the possibility that the policy may be “no return”. As clinicians and researchers begin to use these “resources”, the possibility of finding clinically significant IF is becoming a reality. Discussion: In line with the WMA's Declaration of Taipei, a pragmatic approach is needed to deal with the issue of returning IF in biobank governance. Indeed, the impacts and concerns associated with the return of IF differ across different stakeholder groups and jurisdictions. Therefore, the framework governing IF return needs to be custom-built, taking into account the nature of each research project and the unique features of biobanks. To this end, in addition to facilitating biobank transparency, establishing an endurable and horizontal connection among biobanks and clinical institutions under a public health system will improve efficiency and effectiveness. Hence, subject to contemporary Taiwanese ethical and/or legal regulations, this article argues for the establishment of an updated framework for imaging-related and genetic-related IF return within the Taiwan Biobank (TWB), mainly based on a limited obligation to disclose life-threatening information revealed by imaging, but not genetic, information. After discussing some of the ethical, legal and social issues encountered by the TWB and accounting for the experiences of other international biobanks, we propose a systematic framework for returning IF, mainly on a “limited obligation” basis, which offers better and more comprehensive protection for biobank-participants' rights and health. ? 2019 The Authors",Biobanks; Bioethics; Framework; Incidental finding; The WMA Declaration of Taipei (2016),Diagnosis; Philosophical aspects; Biobanks; Bioethics; Framework; Incidental findings; The WMA Declaration of Taipei (2016); Laws and legislation; adult; biobank; bioethics; clinician; human; incidental finding; informed consent; public health; responsibility; review; scientist; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85070760189

Previous work posited that to leverage the impact of technologies in learning and instruction, a better understanding of the interplay between technology and cognition is warranted. In this vein, the current study set out to investigate the effects of four different caption modes (full vs. partial vs. real-time vs. control) on the listening comprehension of 95 high-intermediate Taiwanese learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) with different caption reliance (i.e. more-caption-reliant vs. less-caption-reliant). The results showed no significant difference between the participants’ listening comprehension outcomes under the four caption conditions when their caption reliance was not considered. However, when this was considered, the differences among the four caption conditions became salient, which was suggestive of the selective effect of captions on L2 learners with different caption reliance. While less-caption-reliant L2 learners had the best listening comprehension outcome under the partial-caption condition and the worst under the full-caption condition, more-caption-reliant L2 learners exhibited the best performance under the full-caption condition yet the worst under the partial-caption condition. The finding underscores the importance of considering L2 learners’ processing profiles when utilizing captioned videos as multimodal instructional/learning materials and speaks to the need of utilizing differentiated video materials for optimal listening outcomes. ?

After dividing CSW of seven classic domains into two dimensions of positive and negative CSW, the results of confirmatory factor analyses showed that the two-dimensional CSW model had better model fit than the one-dimensional model in all domains. Furthermore, relative to using one-dimensional CSW as a predictor of depression, the variance accounted for largely increased when positive and negative CSW entered simultaneously in the regression equation.

While no cure is currently available toward tackling amyloid diseases, prevention or suppression of amyloid ?brillization is considered as the primary therapeutic strategy. Nanomaterials have been demonstrated to possess great potential in the fields of biomedical diagnosis and drug delivery, they are also able to affect the amyloid aggregation of proteins. This work explores the effects of three different magnetic nanoparticles coated with dextran-based polymers on the in vitro amyloid fibrillogenesis of human insulin. Surface modification of nanoparticles with dextran-based polymers was used to improve the biocompatibility of maghemite nanoparticles. We demonstrated that insulin fibrillization may be mitigated by the studied nanoparticles in a concentration-dependent fashion as verified by ThT binding assay and transmission electron microscopy. The extent of inhibitory activity against human insulin fibril formation was found to be associated with the physico-chemical properties of nanoparticles, with the highest inhibitory activity observed for diethylaminoethyl-dextran-coated nanoparticles. Using circular dichroism spectroscopy, ANS fluorescence spectroscopy, and right-angle light scattering, we probed the structural/conformational changes and investigated the aggregating behavior of insulin upon treatment with nanoparticles. This work demonstrates that nanoparticles with an appropriate surface modification can be utilized to suppress or even inhibit amyloid fibril formation of proteins. ? 2018",Amyloid fibril; Dextran; Inhibition; Insulin; Maghemite; Nanoparticle; Protein aggregation,"Biocompatibility; Biomedical engineering; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Dextran; Diagnosis; Dichroism; Diseases; Enzyme inhibition; Fluorescence spectroscopy; Glycoproteins; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Insulin; Light scattering; Nanomagnetics; Nanoparticles; Plastic coatings; Polypeptides; Proteins; Surface treatment; Transmission electron microscopy; Amyloid fibril; Amyloid fibril formation; Concentration-dependent; Maghemite nanoparticle; Maghemites; Magnetic nano-particles; Physicochemical property; Protein aggregation; Drug delivery; amyloid; dextran; human insulin; maghemite nanoparticle; nanoparticle; thioflavine; unclassified drug; amyloid; benzothiazole derivative; biocompatible coated material; dextran; insulin; nanoparticle; protein aggregate; amyloid fibrillogenesis; Article; binding assay; circular dichroism; conformational transition; controlled study; in vitro study; limit of quantitation; photon correlation spectroscopy; physical chemistry; priority journal; protein analysis; spectrofluorometry; transmission electron microscopy; chemistry; human; metabolism; protein secondary structure; protein tertiary structure; static electricity; ultrastructure; Amyloid; Benzothiazoles; Circular Dichroism; Coated Materials, Biocompatible; Dextrans; Dynamic Light Scattering; Humans; Insulin; Nanoparticles; Protein Aggregates; Protein Structure, Secondary; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Static Electricity",2-s2.0-85053473427

Chronic kidney disease(CKD), another important cause of death, shares several traditional cardiovascular riskfactors with ischaemic stroke. Therefore, it is important to examine the existence of shared risk factors in the association between CKD and ischaemic stroke. This study used a health examination database from a medical centre in Taiwan. A generalized linear regression analysis was used to determine the association between CKD and ischaemic stroke. The Maentel-Haenszel test was performed to analyse the effect of possible confounding factors on the association between CKD and ischaemic stroke. A prevalence rate study showed that more subjects with CKD suffered from ischaemic stroke than subjects without CKD. Diabetes, hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia were associated with increased risks of ischaemic stroke in CKD subjects. There was an inverse association of the odds ratio of ischaemic stroke between CKD and non-CKD patients, which implied that younger subjects with CKD should be made aware of ischaemic stroke prevention. ? 2018, The Author(s).",,"adult; aged; brain ischemia; cerebrovascular accident; chronic kidney failure; complication; factual database; female; human; male; middle aged; odds ratio; prevalence; risk factor; statistical model; Taiwan; Adult; Aged; Brain Ischemia; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Stroke; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85050632042

Histological analysis and optical microscopy were used to assess the three-dimensional structure of the PRF network. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, quantification of adenosine triphosphate, and bioluminescence imaging of PRF sections were used to assess cytokine and entrapped platelet distribution. Three-dimensional structures of fibrin networks revealed concentration gradients of the platelet-derived growth factor beta beta homodimer and the transforming growth factor-beta 1. Histological analysis of PRF sections (from the red blood cell end to the plasma end of a clot) showed a gradual increase in average porosity, most prominently in PRF clots from young and middle-Aged men and women, and a decrease in compactness along the longitudinal axis of the PRF gel.

Depression is widely recognized as a risk factor associated with HF. This study examined the relationship between suicide and HF after controlling for depression and other comorbidities. Methods and Results: The population comprised 52,749 adult patients who died from suicide from 2000 to 2012 and 210,996 living control subjects matched by age, sex, and residence area. Data were obtained from the Health and Welfare Data Science Center, Taiwan. Multivariable models were constructed to evaluate the relationship between HF and suicide. In the case and control groups 1624 (3.08%) and 4053 (1.92%) patients had HF, respectively, indicating that HF was associated with an increased risk of suicide (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.59–1.79). The risk of suicide was highest during the initial 6 months after HF (adjusted OR 7.04, 95% CI 5.37–9.22) and subsequently declined gradually. Among psychiatric disorders, mood disorders (adjusted OR 7.42, 95% CI 7.06–7.79) yielded the highest odds of suicide. Conclusions: The risk of suicide is higher for patients with HF than for healthy individuals without HF. This risk is particularly high during the first 6 months after HF diagnosis. This study provides strong evidence that depression is a negative prognostic factor for patients with HF and increases the risk of suicide. The results suggest that early screening and treatment for depression and suicide risk should be conducted for patients with HF. ? 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Comorbidity; depression; health care utilization; heart failure; suicide,adult; age; aged; Article; comorbidity; confidence interval; controlled study; demography; depression; disease association; female; heart failure; human; major clinical study; male; mood disorder; odds ratio; priority journal; risk factor; sex; suicide; Taiwan; adolescent; clinical trial; follow up; heart failure; mental disease; middle aged; multicenter study; prevalence; procedures; retrospective study; risk assessment; statistics and numerical data; suicide; time factor; trends; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Comorbidity; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Heart Failure; Humans; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Suicide; Taiwan; Time Factors; Young Adult,2-s2.0-85054085722

Imbalance dataset commonly exists in some domains like medical problems. This study intends to propose a classification algorithm based on information granulation (IG) concept for handling imbalanced dataset. The proposed algorithm assembles data from majority classes into granules to balance the class ratio within the data. The proposed algorithm works in two stages. First stage generates a set of IGs using metaheuristics approaches which is a kind of automatic clustering algorithm including dynamic clustering using particle swarm optimization (DCPSO), genetic algorithm K-means (GA K-means), and artificial bee colony K-means (ABC K-means). The next stage applies classification algorithm to classify the data. In this study, the proposed algorithm is verified using both balance and imbalanced benchmark datasets. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms have promising classification results. Furthermore, this study also applies the proposed algorithms to prostate cancer prognosis classification problem. The algorithm is employed to predict survival rate of prostate cancer patients based on some medical data.

However, the usual presence of several hundreds of similarly looking, but completely different types of blister packages, in a crowded dispensing station makes it prone to human error, posing serious safety and health concerns for a patients life. In this work, we propose a highlighted deep learning (HDL) based approach for accurate identification of blister packages. HDL allows smart manipulation on raw data in order to better segment the identified targets and to expose inherent descriptive features, thus facilitating an accurate deep learning based classification process. Specifically, HDL uses automatic detection and then segments and processes the raw blister pack images irrespective of position, lighting variations, etc., making them suitable for CNN to classify the correct blister pack types. A ResNet CNN classifier has been trained using the processed images, and the resultant CNN model is finally deployed for classification. We have conducted an extensive experiment at the adult lozenge dispensing station of MacKay Memorial Hospital. The database that will be released along with this paper, consists of 272 types of blister packages, with 65 images belonging to each type for training and additional 7 images for validation. On real testing scenario, the proposed approach yielded almost 100% accuracy, consistently over the entire testing set. The proposed solution can also be extended to any dispensing station for automatic detection and classification of blister packages, thereby offering an highly effective and efficient delivery system. ? 2018 IEEE.",Blister package identification; Classification; CNN; Deep learning; ResNet,Classification (of information); Factory automation; Image processing; Packaging; Automatic Detection; Classification process; Delivery systems; Learning based identification; Lighting variations; Processed images; ResNet; Safety and healths; Deep learning,2-s2.0-85057292106

Seven inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors were placed at seven locations: the lower back (L5) and both sides of the thigh, distal tibia (shank), and foot. The 20 subjects selected to participate in this study were separated into two groups: stroke patients (11) and patients with neurological disorders other than stroke (brain concussion, spinal injury, or brain hemorrhage) (9). The temporal parameters of gait were calculated using a wearable device, and various features and sensor configurations were examined to establish the ideal accuracy for classifying different groups. A comparison of the various methods and features for classifying the three groups revealed that a combination of time domain and gait temporal feature-based classification with the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm outperformed the other methods of feature-based classification. The classification results of different sensor placements revealed that the sensor placed on the shank achieved higher accuracy than the other sensor placements (L5, foot, and thigh). The placement-based classification of the shank sensor achieved 89.13% testing accuracy with the Decision Tree (DT) classifier algorithm. The results of this study indicate that the wearable IMU device is capable of differentiating between the gait patterns of healthy patients, patients with stroke, and patients with other neurological disorders. Moreover, the most favorable results were reported for the classification that used the combination of time domain and gait temporal features as the model input and the shank location for sensor placement. ? 2018 by the authors.

Nanostructured composite materials coupled with impedimetric sensing utilised in this study offered a feasible solution. Herein, novel gold (Au) nanorods were synthesized on 3D graphene grown by chemical vapour deposition. The irregularly spaced and rippled morphology of 3D graphene provided a path for Au nanoparticles to self-assemble and form rod-like structures on the surface of the 3D graphene. The formation of Au nanorods were showcased through scanning electron microscopy which revealed the evolution of Au nanoparticle into Au islets. Eventually, it formed nanorods possessing lengths of ~ 150 nm and diameters of ~ 30 nm. The X-ray diffractogram displayed appropriate peaks suitable to defect-free and high crystalline graphene with face centered cubic Au. The strong optical interrelation between Au nanorod and 3D graphene was elucidated by Raman spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, the anchored Au nanorods on 3D graphene nanocomposite enables feasible bio-capturing on the exposed Au surface on defect free graphene.

We investigated ultrasound microbubbles (USMB) as a tool to increase the local intra-tumoral CDDP level while decreasing systemic CDDP cytotoxicity. We allowed CDDP to interact with human serum albumin and then sonicated the resulting CDDP-albumin complex to generate CDDP-loaded MBs (CDDP-MBs). We then established a head-and-neck tumor-bearing mouse model by implanting FaDu-fLuc/GFP cells into severe combined immunodeficiency mice and used IVIS? bioluminescence imaging to determine the tumor xenograft formation and size. Twice weekly (until Day 33), we administered CDDP only, CDDP + MBs + US, CDDP-MBs, or CDDP-MBs + US intravenously by tail-vein injection. The US treatment was administered at the tumor site immediately after injection. The in vivo systemic distribution of CDDP indicated that the kidney was the most vulnerable organ, followed by the liver, and then the inner ear. However, CDDP uptake into the kidney and liver was significantly decreased in both the CDDP-MBs and CDDP-MBs + US groups, suggesting that MB binding significantly reduced the systemic toxicity of CDDP. The CDDP-MBs + US treatment reduced the tumor size as effectively as conventional CDDP-only chemotherapy. Therefore, the combination of CDDP-MBs with ultrasound is effective and significantly attenuates CDDP-associated nephrotoxicity, indicating a promising clinical potential for this approach. ? 2018 by the authors.

The drug release profiles indicated that fast release were observed during the initial few hours and maximum release 54% were shown after 48 h and 52.5% after 24 h in the presence of GSH and H 2 O 2 respectively, and gradually drug release were decreased as the time increases. Interestingly, γ-ray irradiation drug release also showed that maximum of 46% the drug released within 12 h after irradiation. Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that the synthesized nanogel could be a promising redox and radiation-sensitive nanocarrier biomaterial for high loading amount of anticancer drug and could be used for anticancer drugs delivery in redox environment and a low dose of γ-ray radiation. ? 2017",Cancer; Drug; Nanogel; Polymer; Selenium,Biocompatibility; Block copolymers; Controlled drug delivery; Diseases; Drug dosage; Drug products; Ethylene glycol; Functional polymers; Gamma rays; Irradiation; Nanoparticles; Nanostructured materials; Polyethylene glycols; Polymers; Polyols; Radiotherapy; Selenium; Selenium compounds; Amphiphilic block copolymers; Cancer; Drug; Drug-loading efficiency; Nanogels; Phosphate-buffered salines; Synthesis and characterizations; Ultraviolet visible spectrophotometer; Targeted drug delivery,2-s2.0-85044732241

GO-CD possessed 1.2 times higher DOX-loading capacity than GO due to inclusion of additional DOX to the CD. The drug loading on GO-CD-DEN increased in the order: DOX < PpIX < CPT. Enhanced cytotoxicity of DOX and CPT and also the photocytotoxicity of PpIX were observed when the drugs were loaded in GO-CD and GO-CD-DEN.

Cognitive radio (CR) is introduced to increase spectrum efficiency and support such an endeavor, which thereby becomes a promising building block toward facilitating cognitive IoT. In this paper, primary users (PUs) refer to devices in existing wireless infrastructure, and secondary users (SUs) refer to cognitive sensors. For interference control between PUs and SUs, SUs adopt dynamic spectrum access and power adjustment to ensure sufficient operation of PUs, which inevitably leads to increasing latency and poses new challenges on the reliability of IoT communications. To guarantee operations of primary systems while simultaneously optimizing system performance in CR ad hoc networks (CRAHNs), this paper proposes interference-aware flooding schemes exploiting global timeout and vaccine recovery schemes to control the heavy buffer occupancy induced by packet replications. The information delivery dynamics of SUs under the proposed interference-aware recovery-assisted flooding schemes is analyzed via epidemic models and stochastic geometry from a macroscopic view of the entire system. The simulation results show that our model can efficiently capture the complicated data delivery dynamics in CRAHNs in terms of end-to-end transmission reliability and buffer occupancy. This paper sheds new light on analysis of recovery-assisted flooding schemes in CRAHNs and provides performance evaluation of cognitive IoT services built upon CRAHNs. 2017 IEEE.",,Ad hoc networks; Analytical models; Cognitive systems; Computer system recovery; Dynamics; Electric power transmission; Epidemiology; Floods; Internet of things; Mathematical models; Medium access control; Oil well flooding; Recovery; Reliability; Sensor data fusion; Spectrum analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Vaccines; Wave interference; Wireless sensor networks; Buffer occupancy; Cognitive internets; Cognitive radio Ad-Hoc networks; Delays; Epidemic modeling; Routing; Cognitive radio,2-s2.0-85029147336

These newly developed micelles exhibit excellent pH-responsive behavior and biocompatibility, highly controlled drug (doxorubicin; DOX) release behavior, and high drug encapsulation stability in different aqueous environments, making the micelles highly attractive potential candidates for safer, more effective drug delivery in applications such as cancer chemotherapy. In addition, in vitro cell studies revealed the drug-loaded micelles possessed excellent drug entrapment stability and low cytotoxicity toward macrophages under normal physiological conditions (pH 7.4, 37 °C). When the pH of the culture media was reduced to 6.0 to mimic the acidic tumor microenvironment, the drug-loaded micelles triggered rapid release of DOX within the cells, which induced potent antiproliferative and cytotoxic effects in vitro. Importantly, fluorescent imaging and flow cytometric analyses confirmed the DOX-loaded micelles were efficiently delivered into the cytoplasm of the cells via endocytosis and then subsequently gradually translocated into the nucleus. Therefore, these multifunctional micelles could serve as delivery vehicles for precise, effective, controlled drug release to prevent accumulation and activation of tumor-promoting tumor-associated macrophages in cancer tissues. Thus, this unique system may offer a potential route toward the practical realization of next-generation pH-responsive therapeutic delivery systems.

This study developed a dual modality (fluorescence/MR) imaging technique for cancer cell lines (HeLa) and T2-weighted phantom imaging by using a mixed lanthanide (Dy/Er/Tb) oxide nanoparticles. To further enhance the solubility, stability and biocompatibility of mixed lanthanide oxide, the nanoparticles were coated with folic acid as well as G4.5 PAMAM dendrimer. The coated nanoparticles were then compared, the later with results demonstrating pronounced effects in both T2 weighted phantom MR and fluorescence imaging of the cancer cell lines. Imaging enhancement was attributed to a synergistic effect of the fluorescent properties and higher water solubility of the PAMAM dendrimer when compared to the folic acid. Besides, mixed lanthanides of Dy and Tb were used for T2 weighted MR imaging, while mixed lanthanides of Er and Tb were used for fluorescence imaging in the near infrared and visible regions, and were synthesized in the facile composition control. Hence, the mixed lanthanide oxides are packed together, and stable, which is used to facilitate biomedical imaging in vitro.

Ultrasound parametric imaging, which is based on statistical models, assesses fatty liver changes, using quantitative visualization of hepatic-steatosis–caused variations in the statistical properties of backscattered signals. One constraint with using statistical models in ultrasound imaging is that ultrasound data must conform to the distribution employed. Small-window entropy imaging was recently proposed as a non–model-based parametric imaging technique with physical meanings of backscattered statistics. In this study, we explored the feasibility of using small-window entropy imaging in the assessment of fatty liver disease and evaluated its performance through comparisons with parametric imaging based on the Nakagami distribution model (currently the most frequently used statistical model). Liver donors (n = 53) and patients (n = 142) were recruited to evaluate hepatic fat fractions (HFFs), using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and to evaluate the stages of fatty liver disease (normal, mild, moderate and severe), using liver biopsy with histopathology. Livers were scanned using a 3-MHz ultrasound to construct B-mode, small-window entropy and Nakagami images to correlate with HFF analyses and fatty liver stages. The diagnostic values of the imaging methods were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves. The results demonstrated that the entropy value obtained using small-window entropy imaging correlated well with log10(HFF), with a correlation coefficient r = 0.74, which was higher than those obtained for the B-scan and Nakagami images. Moreover, small-window entropy imaging also resulted in the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.80 for stages equal to or more severe than mild; 0.90 for equal to or more severe than moderate; 0.89 for severe), which indicated that non–model-based entropy imaging—using the small-window technique—performs more favorably than other techniques in fatty liver assessment. ? 2018 World Federation for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology",Entropy imaging; Fatty liver; Hepatic steatosis; Ultrasound,"Chemical sensors; Diagnosis; Entropy; Magnetic resonance; Magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Statistics; Ultrasonic imaging; Ultrasonics; Backscattered statistics; Correlation coefficient; Fatty liver; Hepatic steatosis; Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; Quantitative visualization; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Statistical properties; Diseases; area under the curve; Article; B scan; clinical evaluation; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic value; disease classification; disease severity; entropy; fatty liver; feasibility study; hepatic fat fraction; histopathology; human; human tissue; liver biopsy; liver donor; major clinical study; mathematical analysis; Nakagami distribution model; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; organ donor; parametric imaging; priority journal; prospective study; receiver operating characteristic; small window entropy imaging; statistical model; ultrasound; adult; aged; diagnostic imaging; echography; female; image processing; liver; male; middle aged; nonalcoholic fatty liver; procedures; Taiwan; young adult; Adult; Aged; Entropy; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Liver; Male; Middle Aged; Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease; Prospective Studies; Taiwan; Ultrasonography; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85044773517

In this study, we examined the feasibility of utilizing Zr53Cu33Al9Ta5 thin film metallic glass (TFMG) to minimize the adhesion of human cancer cells (breast cancer cell, colon cancer cell, and esophageal cancer cell), human and animal platelets. TFMG and pure titanium (Ti) were respectively grown on glass substrates to a thickness of 200 nm using magnetron sputtering. TFMG was shown to reduce surface roughness of approximately 27% than Ti coating did on glass samples. The concentrations of all major ions released from the TFMG were well below toxic levels. TFMG surfaces were more effective than Ti in increasing the contact angle of water, phosphate buffer saline (PBS) and blood from different animal species. The application of TFMG to bare surfaces was shown to reduce the attachment area of human platelets by 77% and that of pig platelets by 63%. TFMG also reduced the attachment of cancer cells by up to ~87%. These characteristics can be attributed to a low surface free energy of TFMG-coated surfaces (31.89 mN/m), which is far below that of Ti-coated (39.25 mN/m) and bare glass (47.80 mN/m). These findings demonstrate the considerable potential of TFMG coatings in the fabrication of medical instruments aimed at preventing the adhesion of platelet and cancer cells. ? 2018",Blood; Cancer cell; Platelet; Thin film metallic glass,Adhesion; Aluminum alloys; Animals; Blood; Coatings; Copper alloys; Cytology; Diseases; Free energy; Glass; Metallic glass; Platelets; Saline water; Substrates; Surface roughness; Tantalum alloys; Thin films; Zirconium alloys; Breast cancer cells; Cancer cell attachment; Cancer cells; Medical instruments; Phosphate buffer salines; Surface free energy; Thin film metallic glass; Thrombus formation; Cells,2-s2.0-85044127374

However, additional investigations are warranted to validate their clinical value, particularly in detecting the synergy patterns of movements after stroke. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and efficacy of wearable devices for upper limb rehabilitation in patients with chronic stroke and to compare the intervention effects (e.g., neurological recovery, active range of motion, and deviation angle) with those in a control group. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized-controlled pilot study. SETTING: Rehabilitation ward. METHODS: A total of 18 patients with chronic stroke were randomly distributed into a device group and control group. Both groups received conventional rehabilitation; nevertheless, the device group was additionally subjected to 15 daily sessions at least three times a week for 5 weeks. The outcome measures included the upper extremity subscores of the Fugl-Meyer assessment, active range of motion, and deviation angle. These measurements were performed pre- and post-treatment. RESULTS: All five Fugl-Meyer assessment subscores improved in both the device and control groups after intervention; in particular, the “shoulder/elbow/forearm” subscore (P=0.02, 0.03) and “total score” (P=0.03, 0.03) substantially improved. The active range of motion of shoulder flexion and abduction substantially improved at pre-post treatment in both the device (P=0.02, 0.03) and control (P=0.02, 0.03) groups.

Previous reports suggested that chlorogenic acid (CGA) is a potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compound. The molecular mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effects of CGA on oxLDL-induced oxidative injuries in human endothelial cells are still largely unknown. This study is aimed to test the hypothesis that CGA protects against oxLDL-facilitated oxidative stress by upregulating SIRT1 and to explore the role of AMPK/PGC-1 pathway and mitochondrial biogenesis. Methods and results: HUVECs were treated with oxLDL in the presence or absence of CGA pretreatment. Our data indicated that CGA pretreatment increased SIRT1 deacetylase activity levels. In addition, CGA reversed oxLDL-impaired SIRT1 and AMPK/PGC-1 activity and mitigated oxLDL-induced oxidative stress and dysfunction of mitochondrial biogenesis. However, silencing SIRT1, AMPK, and PGC-1 abated the ability of CGA to protect against oxidative stress. Results from the present study also suggested that CGA inhibits oxLDL-induced endothelial apoptosis through modulating SIRT1 and AMPK/PGC-1 function. Conclusion: These findings provide new insights into possible molecular mechanisms by which CGA mitigates oxLDL-induced endothelial oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction by activating SIRT1 and modulating the AMPK/PGC-1 signaling pathway. ? 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Here, we report a novel, flexible and biocompatible triboelectric-piezoelectric-pyroelectric hybrid nanogenerator based on a significantly simplified structure with good transparency which mainly due to high-performance transparent electrodes (TEs). Inspired by gradually optimized leaf venation (LV), silver nanowires were arranged into a LV-like network through a green and cost-effective approach. The unique structure led to an ultra-high transmission up to 99% (at 68.2 Ω sq?1 sheet resistance) and sheet resistances as low as 1.4 Ω sq?1 (with 82% transmission). With 3 effects coupled, the generator can scavenge a maximum open-circuit output voltage of 55 V and 86 V to produce mechanical energy and thermal energy, respectively. In addition, the transparent hybrid nanogenerator can be conformally attached on different parts of body for real-time monitoring of various human vital signs including breath, heartbeat pulse and swallowing. With high transparency, the hybrid nanogenerator can be integrated with a thin liquid crystal film possessing thermochromic properties, potentially as a visualized thermometer for medical diagnostics. The research is a substantial advancement toward the realization of cost-effective self-powered sensing like pressure and temperature and its potential applications in device dimension miniaturization, healthcare monitoring, energy conversation, and wearable electronics. ? 2018",Bio-inspired; Biomechanical energy; Flexible transparent conducting electrode; Healthcare monitoring; Hybrid nanogenerator; Silver nanowires,Biocompatibility; Biomechanics; Cost effectiveness; Diagnosis; Electric generators; Health care; Liquid crystals; Liquid films; Nanogenerators; Nanowires; Patient monitoring; Physiology; Plastic films; Sheet resistance; Silver; Transparency; Wearable technology; Bio-inspired; Biomechanical energy; Healthcare monitoring; Nanogenerator; Silver nanowires; Transparent conducting electrodes; Transparent electrodes,2-s2.0-85044921377

But, at the same time, a myriad of users have deviated themselves, temporarily or permanently, from social media use due to social media fatigue. Scholars have investigated different antecedents and consequences of social media fatigue. However, empirical relationships between psychosocial wellbeing and social media fatigue are currently not known. To bridge this gap, the current study utilises the stressor-strain-outcome framework (SSO) to examine whether psychosocial wellbeing measures, such as compulsive media use and fear of missing out, trigger fatigue and, furthermore, whether social media fatigue results in anxiety and depression. The study utilised repeated cross-sectional methodology whereby two waves of data (N = 1554, 1144) were collected to test the research model with adolescent social media users in India. The study findings suggest that compulsive media use significantly triggered social media fatigue, which later result in elevated anxiety and depression. Fear of missing out indirectly predicted social media fatigue through mediation of compulsive social media use. The theoretical and practical implications, limitations of the present study and agenda for future studies are presented and discussed. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Adolescents; Anxiety; Compulsive media use; Depression; Fear of missing out; Repeated cross-sectional survey; Social media fatigue,Economic and social effects; Adolescents; Anxiety; Cross-sectional surveys; Depression; Fear of missing out; Media use; Social media; Social networking (online),2-s2.0-85042357811

This study explores the possibility of building AI models without precise pixel-level annotation in prediction of the tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, lymph node metastasis, cancer stage and BRAF mutation in thyroid cancer diagnosis, providing the patients' background information, histopathological and immunohistochemical tissue images. Results A novel framework for objective evaluation of automatic patient diagnosis algorithms has been established under the auspices of the IEEE International Symposium on Biomedical Imaging 2017 -A Grand Challenge for Tissue Microarray Analysis in Thyroid Cancer Diagnosis. Here, we present the datasets, methods and results of the challenge and lay down the principles for future uses of this benchmark. The main contributions of the challenge include the creation of the data repository of tissue microarrays; the creation of the clinical diagnosis classification data repository of thyroid cancer; and the definition of objective quantitative evaluation for comparison and ranking of the algorithms. With this benchmark, three automatic methods for predictions of the five clinical outcomes have been compared, and detailed quantitative evaluation results are presented in this paper. Based on the quantitative evaluation results, we believe automatic patient diagnosis is still a challenging and unsolved problem.

This study used an ultrasound imaging system to monitor respiratory movements combined with the proposed UITA and RMCS for tracking and compensation of the respiratory motion. Respiratory motion compensation was performed using prerecorded human respiratory motion signals and also sinusoidal signals. A linear accelerator was used to deliver radiation doses to GAFchromic EBT3 dosimetry film, and the conformity index (CI), root-mean-square error, compensation rate (CR), and planning target volume (PTV) were used to evaluate the tracking and compensation performance of the proposed system. Human respiratory pattern signals were captured using the UITA and compensated by the RMCS, which yielded CR values of 34–78%. In addition, the maximum coronal area of the PTV ranged from 85.53 mm2 to 351.11 mm2 (uncompensated), which reduced to from 17.72 mm2 to 66.17 mm2 after compensation, with an area reduction ratio of up to 90%. In real-time monitoring of the respiration compensation state, the CI values for 85% and 90% isodose areas increased to 0.7 and 0.68, respectively. The proposed UITA and RMCS can reduce the movement of the tracked target relative to the LINAC in radiation therapy, thereby reducing the required size of the PTV margin and increasing the effect of the radiation dose received by the treatment target. ? 2018 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",GAFchromic EBT3 film; Organ motion; Planning target volume; Respiratory motion compensation; Ultrasound image tracking,"algorithm; Article; breathing mechanics; cancer radiotherapy; compensation rate; conformity index; controlled study; diaphragm movement; dosimetry; human; human experiment; imaging and display; normal human; physical parameters; planning target volume; radiation dose distribution; radiotherapy; root root mean square error; signal processing; two dimensional respiratory motion compensation system; ultrasound image tracking; breathing; echography; film dosimetry; image guided radiotherapy; movement (physiology); procedures; Algorithms; Film Dosimetry; Humans; Movement; Radiotherapy, Image-Guided; Respiration; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-85046089271

The AIA is designed to radiate the electromagnetic signal and sense the scattered-back signal, which is phase modulated by the physiological movement of the human chest and wrist. The received self-injection signal from the subject under test locks the AIA and simultaneously introduces a variation in the output magnitude (amplitude modulation) and a shift in the oscillation frequency (frequency modulation). In other words, the output signal of the AIA is a frequency-modulated carrier with an amplitude-varying envelope. To acquire the vital signs from the modulated signal, an envelope detector is integrated with a microwave differentiator to form a differentiator-based envelope detector, which demodulates signal. The heartbeat and wrist pulse rates measured by the proposed sensor agree well with the results acquired by a finger pulse oximeter. Since the proposed demodulator has a simple architecture, it has a potential to be integrated with the AIA in a multilayered printed-circuit board for the realization of a compact wearable self-injection-locked radar sensor. ? 1963-2012 IEEE.",Cardiopulmonary sensor; continuous-wave radar; envelope detection; injection locking (IL); self-injection-locked (SIL) radar; wearable health sensor; wrist pulse sensor,Antennas; Continuous wave radar; Frequency modulation; Microstrip antennas; Modulation; Noninvasive medical procedures; Oscillators (electronic); Oximeters; Printed circuit boards; Radar; Radar antennas; Radar measurement; Signal detection; Tracking radar; Wearable antennas; Wearable technology; Antenna measurement; Envelope Detection; Frequency measurements; Injection locked; Injection-locking; Wrist; Wearable sensors,2-s2.0-85040579342

In fact, it is very difficult to detect very small breathing motion on images. In this paper, well-known techniques are employed to obtain useful features from the chest area for the Lucas-Kanade algorithm. Various levels of the Pyramidal Lucas-Kanade are then adapted to track possible small motions of those features. The proposed approach can successfully detect the inspiratory-expiratory motions and the peak time of inspiratory phase can be predicted within an acceptable interval of error time. From the experiments conducted, the breath motion can be successfully observed in two different environment situations (dim-lighting and lighting conditions). It can be found that the tracked features are quite robust and stable without losing the quantity over a long period of testing time. Thus, the proposed approach can effectively be used to define a proper triggering timing for X-ray shooting. Besides, in our experiments, even though the target is 6 m away, the breath detection is still successful. In other words, the proposed approach can also be used for surveillance or healthcare environments.

After enzymatic hydrolysis and a biochemical analysis, it was determined that C-phycocyanin has anti-tumour effects against human oral and alveolar cancer. This study aimed to determine the feasibility of the algal carbon capture method as a renewable energy technology and improve its energy efficiency. A value chain analysis and Monte Carlo simulation was used for the evaluation, to consolidate existing approaches of algal CO2 capture and develop them beyond the laboratory scale.

Thirty pairs of parents and children were recruited from periodontal and pediatric dental clinics. All participants were clinically examined for caries and periodontitis by a calibrated examiner. Cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria examinations were conducted. The Kendall rank correlation coefficient was used to measure the association between data variables obtained through clinical and microbiological examinations. A classificatory inductive decision tree was generated using the C4.5 algorithm with the top-down approach. The C4.5 DT analysis was applied to classify major influential factors for children dental caries experience. The DT identified parents’ periodontal health classification, decayed, missing, filled permanent teeth (DMFT) index, periodontopathic test (PerioCheck) result, and periodontal pocket depth as the classification factors for children caries experience. 13.3% of children were identified with a low decayed, missing, filled primary teeth (dmft) index (dmft < 3) whose parents had a periodontal pocket depth ?3.7, PerioCheck score >1, DMFT index <13.5, and periodontal classification >2. The DT model for this study sample had an accuracy of 93.33%.

A comprehensive and mutually exclusive coding scheme was developed to analyze and code each caught-in-between fatality in terms of age, gender, experience of the victim, type of industry, source of injury, and causes for these accidents. Boolean algebra analysis was applied on these 312 caught-in-between fatalities to derive minimal cut set (MCS) causes associated with each source of injury. Eventually, contributing factors and common accident patterns associated with (1) special process machinery including textile, printing, packaging machinery, (2) metal, woodworking, and special material machinery, (3) conveyor, (4) vehicle, (5) crane, (6) construction machinery, and (7) elevator can be divided into three major groups through Boolean algebra and MCS analysis. The MCS causes associated with conveyor share the same primary causes as those of the special process machinery including textile, printing, packaging and metal, woodworking, and special material machinery. These fatalities can be eliminated by focusing on the prevention measures associated with lack of safeguards, working on a running machine or process, unintentional activation, unsafe posture or position, unsafe clothing, and defective safeguards.

The current gold standard for the clinical assessment of parkinsonian tremor is the evaluation using the standard clinical rating scales, which is performed by the well-trained neurologists. However, this assessment approach relies mainly on the subjective judgment of the evaluator. This study, on the basis of the Movement Disorder Society-Sponsored Revision of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) criteria, proposed a custom quantitative assessment system for parkinsonian tremors. It adopted an attitude estimation-based gradient descent algorithm to separate the linear acceleration (caused by pure translational motion) from the accelerometer output, which combines gravity component. Signal features extracted from the linear accelerations and angular velocities during the tremor tasks were fitted to the clinicians’ ratings with a multiple regression model. Clinical experiments with 34 PD patients and 14 age-matched controls demonstrated that the prediction accuracy was improved by using the decomposed linear acceleration for the extraction of tremor features, which has promoted assessment accuracy compared with the relevant literature (r2 improved from 0.89 to 0.95 for rest tremor, and from 0.90 to 0.93 for postural tremor). In addition, the prediction accuracy was worse when using only the linear accelerations for regression analysis (r2 reduced from 0.95 to 0.87 for rest tremor, and from 0.93 to 0.84 for postural tremor), which means that the effect of rotational motion cannot be ignored in tremor quantification. ? 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Linear acceleration; Multiple regression analysis; Parkinson's disease; Tremor quantification; Wearable device,Acceleration; Extraction; Neurodegenerative diseases; Regression analysis; Linear accelerations; Multiple regression analysis; Parkinson's disease; Tremor quantification; Wearable devices; Diseases; adult; aged; algorithm; Article; body position; clinical article; clinical assessment; controlled study; data analysis software; diagnostic accuracy; direction cosine matrix method; disease severity; female; human; linear acceleration; male; middle aged; motion; Movement Disorder Society Scale; Parkinson disease; priority journal; quantitative analysis; rating scale; regression analysis; tremor; Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale; validation study; velocity,2-s2.0-85041452750

Metallic stents were coated with polyurethane (PU) as the first layer. A 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (2-HEMA)/ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA)/benzoyl peroxide (BPO) layer and a poly(ethylene-co-vinyl acetate) (PEVA)/poly(n-butyl methacrylate) (PBMA)/polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (K30) layer containing various concentrations of Photofrin were then incorporated onto the stent as the second and third layers. After incubating the layered membranes with cultured CCA cell line, the release of Photofrin, cell viability, the intracellular uptake of Photofrin, reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and apoptosis were determined. Using a single-layer diffusion model, the maximum release of Photofrin from the 5 to 10% K30 formulas was 80 and 100%, respectively, after 24?h. When using the multiple-layer diffusion model, the released Photofrin showed an initial burst of the loading dose from the PEVA/PBMA/K30 layer. In the immobilized model, less than 5% of the Photofrin from the 2-HEMA/EGDMA/BPO layer was released over the 24-h period. Cell viability decreased linearly with increasing Photofrin concentrations, and ROS generation and apoptosis were shown to increase significantly with increasing Photofrin concentrations, until the concentration of Photofrin reached a saturation point of 1.5?μg/ml.

We investigated tools commonly used to study static balance. Differences in postural stability were analyzed using multiscale entropy (MSE) and feature analysis. Methods: A force plate and inertial sensor were used to collect acceleration and center-of-pressure (COP) nonlinear signals. MSE was also used to detect fractal correlations and assess the complexity of univariate data complexity. Fifteen healthy subjects participated in the experiments. Each stood on a force plate and wore a sensor while attempting to maintain postural stability for 30 s in four randomized experiments to evaluate their static balance via a copositive experiment with eyes open/closed and with standing on one foot or both feet. A Wilcoxon-signed rank test was used to confirm that the conditions were significant. Considering the effect of the assessment tools, the influence of the visual and lower limb systems on postural stability was assessed and the results from the inertial sensor and force plate experiments were compared. Results: Force plate usage provided more accurate readings when completing static balance tasks based on the visual system, whereas an inertial sensor was preferred for lower-limb tasks. Further, the eyes-open-standing-onone- foot case involved the highest complexity at the X, Y, and Z axes for acceleration and at the ML axis for COP compared with other conditions, from which the axial directions can be identified. Conclusions: The findings suggested investigation of different evaluation tool choices that can be easily adapted to suit different needs. The results for the complexity index and traditional balance indicators were comparable in their implications on different conditions. We used MSE to determine the equipment that measures the postural stability performance. We attempted to generalize the applications of complexity index to tasks and training characteristics and explore different tools to obtain different results.

This study aims to investigate key determinants that affect lung cancer survival and to evaluate the direct and indirect effects (via other mediating variables) of SES on survival time. Bayesian Networks (BNs) were proposed and implemented to analyze a large database from The Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) of the National Cancer Institute of the United States. Results show that the cancer stage at diagnosis is the most critical factor for determining survival time. Investigation of the underlying mechanism identifies both direct and indirect effects of SES on survival time, but the mediation analysis also indicates that the disparity on timely diagnosis (i.e., stage at diagnosis) caused by SES is only marginally significant. ? 2017 IEEE.",Bayesian Networks; Lung Cancer; Socioeconomic Status (SES); Survival Months,Biological organs; Decision making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Bayesian Networks (bns); Health-care decisions; Lung Cancer; Mediation analysis; Medical conditions; National Cancer Institute; Socioeconomic status; Survival Months; Bayesian networks,2-s2.0-85045247378

The present study addressed whether abnormal concentrations of neurochemicals exist in key brain regions of this pathway in chronic migraine. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging of the bilateral medial walls of the brain was used to measure choline, creatine, glutamate and glutamine, myo-inositol, and N-Acetyl-Aspartate in chronic migraine patients and in matched groups of episodic migraine patients and healthy controls. A region of interest analysis was conducted to examine whether N-Acetyl-Aspartate, a marker of neuronal integrity, was reduced in the thalamus, occipital cortex and anterior cingulate cortex in chronic migraine. Interregional N-Acetyl-Aspartate correlations among these regions of interest were also examined. Additionally, statistical mapping was performed for all the metabolites throughout the medial walls. Chronic migraine was associated with N-Acetyl-Aspartate reductions in the bilateral thalami and in the right anterior cingulate. The N-Acetyl-Aspartate reduction in the right thalamus correlated with disease duration. Compared with healthy controls, patients with chronic migraine had altered interregional N-Acetyl-Aspartate correlations between the right thalamus-Anterior cingulate and thalamus-occipital cortex, and between the left and right anterior cingulate. N-Acetyl-Aspartate concentrations and interregional correlations in patients with episodic migraine were between those of healthy controls and chronic migraine patients. The unconstrained analyses revealed a reduction of myo-inositol in the left anterior and posterior cingulate in both patient groups as well as a negative association with depression scores for the anterior cingulate in the combined patient group. In addition, migraine patients with headache on the scan day (irrespective of diagnosis) had reduced N-Acetyl-Aspartate and total creatine concentrations in the right dorsal anterior cingulate. Reduced N-Acetyl-Aspartate metabolism and altered interregional N-Acetyl-Aspartate correlations lend support to the role of thalamocortical dysfunction in migraine chronification. It remains to be established if the pattern of changes within the N-Acetyl-Aspartate network is specific to chronic migraine or can be found in other chronic pain conditions. ? The Author (2017).

Methods: We blended poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) into nylon-6 through electrospinning to generate a fibrous matbased circulating tumour cells (CTCs) assay. The contents of nylon-6 and PEO in the electrospun blend fibrous mats (EBFMs) were optimized to facilitate high cell-substrate affinity and low leukocyte adsorption. Results: Compared with the IsoFlux System, a commercial instrument for CTC detection, the CTC assay of EBFMs exhibited lower false positive readings and high sensitivity and selectivity with preclinical specimens. Furthermore, we examined the clinical diagnosis accuracy of colorectal cancer, using the CTC assay and compared the results with those identified through pathological analyses of biopsies from colonoscopies. Our positive expressions of colorectal cancer through CTC detection completely matched those recognized through the pathological analyses for the individuals having stage II, III, and IV colorectal cancer. Nevertheless, two in four individuals having stage I colorectal cancer, recognized through pathological analysis of biopsies from colonoscopies, exhibited positive expression of CTCs.

In addition, the LSV performance of PLL modified electrode offers a lower detection potential, higher sensitivity and fast response towards the detection of sulfide ions. The linear concentration for sulfide ions determination ranges from 11.8–6663 μM with a detection limit of 2.65 μM was observed.

Oleylamine-coated Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared through a thermal decomposition route and subsequently transformed into an aqueous phase using hyaluronic acid (HA) via an ultrasonic-assisted emulsion approach. The functional terminal carboxyl groups of the HA outer layer not only promoted the water solubility of Fe3O4 NPs and their targeting ability towards the CD44 overexpressing cancer cells but also allowed straightforward coupling with Ce6. The tumor targeting ability and cellular uptake of the theranostic agent have been demonstrated by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry (FCM) studies. FCM analysis allowed us to quantify the cellular uptake behavior in response to increased Ce6-HA-Fe3O4 concentration. While no significant toxicity was observed, cell fluorescence signals increased strongly in correlation with the concentration. Analysis on the photodynamic therapeutic (PDT) efficiency tested on B16F1 cells revealed 76.7% cell death under laser irradiation for 10 min (671 nm, 1 W), which is attributed to the successful co-delivery of active Ce6 using HA-Fe3O4 nanocarriers. Taken together, these results indicate that the multifunctional platform retained and combined the original magnetic, fluorescence, and PDT performance of the components in a single remotely triggered nanotheranostic agent. We anticipate that the theranostic agent Ce6-HA-Fe3O4 can act as a promising targeted dual modal probe and a PDT agent to enhance diagnosis and treatment of cancer. ?

Increases in outpatients seeking medical check-ups are expanding the number of health examination data records, which can be utilized for medical strategic planning and other purposes. However, because hospital visits by outpatients seeking medical check-ups are unpredictable, those patients often cannot receive optimal service due to limited facilities of hospitals. To resolve this problem, this study attempted to predict re-visit patterns of outpatients. Method. Two-phase sequential pattern mining (SPM) and an association mining method were chosen to predict patient returns using sequential data. The data were grouped according to the outpatients' personal information and evaluated by a discriminant analysis to check the significance of the grouping. Furthermore, SPM was employed to generate frequency patterns from each group and extract a general association pattern of return. Results. Results of sequence patterns and association mining in this study provided valuable insights in terms of outpatients' re-visit behaviors for regular medical check- ups. Cosine and Jaccard are two symmetric measures which were used in this study to indicate the degree of association between two variables. For instance, Jaccard values of variable abnormal blood pressure associated with an abnormal body-mass index (BMI) and/or abnormal blood sugar were respectively 47.5% and 100%, for the two- visit and three-visit behavior patterns. These results indicated that the corresponding pair of variables was more reliable when covering the three-visit behavior pattern than the two-visit behavior. Thus, appropriate preventive measures or suggestions for other medical treatments can be prepared for outpatients that have this pattern on their third visit. The higher degree of association implies that the corresponding behavior pattern might influence outpatients' intentions to regularly seek medical check-ups concerning the risk of stroke. Furthermore, a radiology diagnosis (i.e., magnetic resonance imaging or neck vascular ultrasound) plays an important role in the association with a re-visit behavior pattern with respective 50% and 70% Cosine and Jaccard values in general behavior (f11) ^ (f01). These findings can serve as valuable information to increase the quality of medical services and marketing, by suggesting appropriate treatment for the subsequent visit after learning the behavior patterns. Conclusions. The proposed method can provide valuable information related to outpatients' re-visit behavior patterns based on hidden knowledge generated from sequential patterns and association mining results. For marketing purposes, medical practitioners can take behavior patterns studied in this paper into account to raise patients' awareness of several possible medical conditions that might arise on subse- quent visits and encourage them to take preventive measures or suggest other medical treatments. ? 2018 Ou-Yang et al.",Cerebrovascular disease; Re-visit behavior patterns; Sequential Pattern Mining,abnormal blood pressure; adult; aged; Article; association rule mining; body mass; cerebrovascular disease; data mining; data processing; electronic health record; health care facility; health service; human; medical examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; outpatient care; sequential pattern mining; validation process; very elderly,2-s2.0-85049895796

OBJECTIVE: The present study applied spectral and beat-to-beat analyses to laser-Doppler (LDF) data sequences measured on the skin surface on the back of the right hands, with the aim of comparing the different peripheral microcirculatory-bloodflow (MBF) perfusion condition between breast-cancer and control subjects. METHODS: ECG and LDF signals were obtained simultaneously and noninvasively from 23 breast-cancer patients and 23 age-matched control subjects. Time-domain beat-to-beat indexes and their variability parameters were calculated. Spectral indexes were calculated using the Morlet wavelet transform. RESULTS: The beat-to-beat LDF pulse width and its variability were significantly smaller in cancer patients than in the controls. The energy contributions of endothelial-, neural-, and myogenic-related frequency bands were also significantly smaller in cancer patients. CONCLUSIONS: The present study has revealed significant differences in the beat-to-beat and spectral indexes of skinsurface- A cquired LDF signals between control subjects and breast-cancer patients. This illustrates that LDF indexes may be useful for monitoring the changes in the MBF perfusion condition induced by breast cancer.

Here, we report the effect of four sizes of cystine/citric acid-coated confeito-like gold nanoparticles (confeito-AuNPs) (30, 60, 80 and 100 nm) on cellular uptake, intracellular localization and photothermal anticancer treatment efficiency in MDA-MB231 breast cancer cells. Cellular uptake is size dependent with the smallest size of confeito-AuNPs (30 nm) having the highest cellular internalization via clathrin- and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. However, the other three sizes (60, 80 and 100 nm) utilize clathrin-mediated endocytosis for cellular uptake. The intracellular localization of confeito-AuNPs is related to their endocytosis mechanism, where all sizes of confeito-AuNPs were localized highly in the lysosome and mitochondria, while confeito-AuNPs (30 nm) gave the highest localization in the endoplasmic reticulum. Similarly, a size-dependent trend was also observed in in vitro photothermal treatment experiments, with the smallest confeito-AuNPs (30 nm) giving the highest cell killing rate, whereas the largest size of confeito-AuNPs (100 nm) displayed the lowest photothermal efficacy.

Investigators have extensively used the standardized myocardial segmentation of the American Heart Association (AHA) to measure regional T1 values of the left ventricular (LV) walls. In this paper, we present a fully automatic system to analyze modified Look–Locker inversion recovery images and to report regional T1 values of AHA segments. Ten healthy individuals participated in the T1 mapping study with a 3.0?T scanner after providing informed consent. First, we obtained masks of an LV blood-pool region and LV walls by using an image synthesis method and a layer-growing method. Subsequently, the LV walls were divided into AHA segments by identifying the boundaries of the septal regions and by using a radial projection method. The layer-growing method significantly enhanced the accuracy of the derived myocardium mask. We compared the T1 values that were obtained using manual region of interest selections and those obtained using the automatic system. The average T1 difference of the calculated segments was 4.6 ± 1.5%. This study demonstrated a practical and robust method of obtaining native T1 values of AHA segments in LV walls. ? 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Automatic segmentation for cardiac imaging; MOLLI; Native T1,"accuracy; adult; Article; automation; cardiac imaging; cardiac muscle; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle wall; human; human experiment; image processing; image segmentation; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; heart left ventricle function; heart ventricle; predictive value; procedures; young adult; Adult; Automation; Healthy Volunteers; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Myocardium; Predictive Value of Tests; Ventricular Function, Left; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85025463290

This approach will provide better opportunity than hair transplantation to treat alopecia. However, there is no suitable implanter to fulfill these functions, yet more considerations in human factors for the operators. Therefore, this research planned to develop a pneumatic duel-cell implanter that can stack the cells, control the implanting volume, and reduce the burden of doctors’ hand during operation. In order to reduce the weight of the implanter, separated modules were designed, including cell loading control module, handheld injection module, and pneumatic source. The cell loading control module contains two syringes for different cells and a volume control system equipped with liner step motor, delivering the required volume of cells into handheld module. Silicone tubes were used to connect these two modules. Two types of cells can be directed into the handheld injection module and stacked. The handheld injection module mimicked the size and the weight of a ball pen and adjust the mass center for comfortable holding. Near the injection tip, an angle stand was attached to adjust the injection angle for less loading to the hand. The top side of the handheld module was connected to the pneumatic source by flexible pipe. The pneumatic source was triggered by foot stepping to reduce the works by fingers and pushed the cells into scalp. The prototype of the implanter performed simulated implantation test by injecting silicone oil and blue ink into a transparent silicone block. The results showed that the implanter can successfully implant and stack two fluids in the same area. Moreover, suitable air pressure for injection was found and injected volumes were tested. As a result, the handheld injection module only weighs 12 g and no extra loads are needed by hand, which is suitable for implantation operation. ?

As microcirculation provides primary information on tissue health, this paper aims to compare the perfusion characteristics in neck/shoulder of individuals at different physical activity levels. High power laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) system and averaging algorithm were used to obtain the microcirculatory characteristics. Thirty-two participants with different exercise habit were recruited, which were divided into sedentary group (n?=?16) and exercise group (n?=?16). The participants in both groups were matched in age, gender, and body mass index. Peripheral blood perfusion signals on the neck-shoulder region pre- and post- upper trapezius stretching were acquired using LDF with a noninvasive wide separation probe. A modified beat-to-beat algorithm was then applied for the analysis of the microcirculatory signals, including pulsatile and nonpulsatile components. The Mann–Whitney U test was used to compare the differences of perfusion characteristics between these two groups. The pulsatile component of LDF signals in the exercise group was greater than that of the sedentary counterparts after the upper trapezius stretching (P?<?0.05). Furthermore, the index of perfusion pulsatility (ratio of pulsatile component to mean LDF signal) of the exercise group was significantly higher than that of the sedentary group (P?<?0.01). This index could differentiate these two groups both at the baseline and post- stretching. Even with low exercise volume, exercise group with regular physical activity appear noticeably different in microcirculatory characteristics in this study. The subjects who exercised had higher values of microcirculatory pulsatility. These findings may encourage people to exercise more often based on the benefit in microcirculation even with small increases in physical activity volume. ? 2017, Taiwanese Society of Biomedical Engineering.",Exercise; Laser-Doppler flowmetry; Microcirculation; Physical activity; Pulsatility,Classifiers; Doppler effect; Flow measurement; Flowmeters; Health; High power lasers; Exercise; Exercise habits; Laser doppler flowmetry; Musculoskeletal disease; Peripheral blood; Physical activity; Physical activity levels; Pulsatility; Microcirculation; adult; algorithm; Article; controlled study; Doppler flowmetry; exercise; female; habit; human; human experiment; male; microcirculation; muscle stretching; neck; normal human; perfusion; pulsatility index; sedentary lifestyle; shoulder; signal processing; trapezius muscle,2-s2.0-85037043673

Herein, we describe the human dental stem cells (DSCs) deriving from buccal fat pads (BFP), dental pulp (DP) of impacted teeth, and periodontal ligaments (PDL) to obtain BFPSCs, DPSCs, and PDLSCs, respectively. Cells were purified with selected medium and expanded through passages in stem cell culture medium. Purified cells were characterized for stemness by their growth rate, immunostaining, and multilineage differentiation ability. They showed plastic adherence, expression of stemness-specific markers, and multilineage differentiation potential. Immunocytochemistry analysis confirmed that DPSCs had more osteogenic potential than BFSCs and PDLSCs. Calcium-rich deposits, evaluated by von Kossa and Alizarin red staining, showed greater mineralization when DPSCs were cultured on collagen type I matrix than without collagen. Furthermore, DPSC-seeded collagen type I matrix maintained consistent osteogenesis and boosted mineral formation by 1–2 weeks over that in DPSCs cultured without collagen. Radiographic analysis of DPSC-seeded collagen type I matrix transplanted into rat cranial defects showed significant bone regeneration after 8 weeks. These results suggested that the redundant oral tissue can be used as a source of adult multipotent stem cells for clinical bone regeneration.

Clinical data and outcomes were evaluated with an average follow-up of 117 months. The results were validated via lung cancer cell line studies. The clinical parameters did not differ between relapse and nonrelapse patients. Exceptions were tumor differentiation, lymphovascular space invasion, F18-fluorodeoxyglucose maximum standard uptake value, tumor size, and pathological stage (p &lt; 0.001).

Since lipo-doxorubicin (Lipodox) has the advantages of longer half-life and lower clearance rate than doxorubicin, it should improve the efficacy of tumor therapy and reduce the normal tissue toxicity of doxorubicin. Materials and Methods In this study, we compared the cytotoxicity of Lipodox and doxorubicin in different treatment durations on bladder cancer cells by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Drug distribution was tracked under fluorescence microscopy. The metabolic rate after treatment was measured by serial flow cytometry. Finally, an in vivo orthotopic MBT-2 bladder tumor model was established for comparing the differences of therapeutic efficacy, including tumor weight and survival rate. Results The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of doxorubicin and Lipodox for MBT-2 cells was 0.62 μg/mL and 130 μg/mL, respectively, after 48 hours treatment. Lipo-dox presented higher cytotoxicity than doxorubicin at 6 hours (93% vs 73%) and 12 hours (93% vs 80%) treatment. After drug treatment, Lipodox fluorescence distribution was observed mostly in the cell membrane, lysosomes, and nuclei of tumor cells, while doxorubicin was concentrated in the nuclei. Initial fluorescence intensity of doxorubicin was 27.3 times that of Lipodox (p &lt; 0.001) at time of treatment. The fluorescence intensity of doxorubicin decreased to 12% after 24 hours culture but that of Lipodox remained at 81%. In an orthotopic model, the average tumor weight and survival were: control group: 1.0 ± 0.3 g, 25%; doxorubicin treatment group: 0.7 ± 0.05 g, 43%; and Lipodox treatment group: 0.2 ± 0.1 g, 57%. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that Lipodox can enhance doxorubicin cytotoxicity in bladder cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth in orthotopic bladder cancer with improved survival rate. Therefore, we suggest Lipodox may act as an alternative to doxorubicin in the treatment of local bladder cancer. ? 2016",bladder cancer; doxorubicin; endocytosis; lipo-doxorubicin,"3 (4,5 dimethyl 2 thiazolyl) 2,5 diphenyltetrazolium bromide; doxorubicin; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bladder cancer; bladder cancer cell line; cancer chemotherapy; cancer inhibition; cell membrane; cell nucleus; controlled study; drug cytotoxicity; drug distribution; drug dosage form comparison; drug efficacy; flow cytometry; fluorescence microscopy; human; human cell; IC50; in vivo study; lysosome; MBT-2 cell line; metabolic rate; mouse; MTT assay; nonhuman; priority journal; survival rate; time to treatment; treatment duration; tumor cell; tumor volume",2-s2.0-84991230936

The GO-CD/Fe@C was loaded with an anticancer drug, doxorubicin (DOX), to form a multifunctional GO-CD/Fe@C/DOX nanohybrid. A cumulative increase in DOX loading was observed probably due to DOX adsorption to the graphitic domains in Fe@C and also to the GO-CD. In acidic pH that resembles the pH of the tumor environment, a higher amount of DOX was released from the GO-CD/Fe@C/DOX nanohybrid when compared to the amount released at physiological pH. The signal intensity and the contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging of Fe@C decreased with its concentration. Besides, the cellular uptake of GO-CD/Fe@C/DOX nanohybrid was significantly higher by 2.5-fold than that of Fe@C/DOX in MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer model. The nanohybrids were internalized into the tumor cells via an energy-dependent process and localized mainly in the nuclei, where it exerts its cytotoxic effect, and some in the lysosomes and mitochondria. This has resulted in significant cytotoxicity in tumor cells treated with GO-CD/Fe@C/DOX. These findings highlight the potential use of multifunctional GO-CD/Fe@C nanohybrid for magnetic sensing anticancer drug delivery to tumor cells.

Accelerating tag identification is an important issue in RFID systems. A series of anti-collision protocols, adaptive binary splitting (ABS), single resolution blocking (SRB), and pair resolution blocking (PRB), has been proposed to solve this problem. However, these protocols still waste much time, since they do not consider the identification delay that is the total time for identifying all tags rather than the number of slots. Thus, this paper proposes a novel protocol, symbolic SRB (SSRB). SSRB inherits the essence of SRB/PRB that reserves the information of the last identification process and adopts the same blocking technique. SSRB further considers the identification delay to allow each recognized tag to respond with a symbolic response, which is a shorter message, instead of its complete ID. Considering different lengths of slots, SSRB further determines the optimal number of initial slots to minimize the identification delay. Also formal analysis of SSRB identification delay with considering different slot lengths is derived. The analytic models and simulation results show that SSRB obtains superior performance than ABS, SRB, and PRB. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Anti-collision; Blocking; RFID; Tag identification,Collision avoidance; Reservation systems; Supply chain management; Analytic models; Anti collision; Anti-collision protocols; Blocking; Blocking technique; Healthcare services; Identification process; Tag identification; Radio frequency identification (RFID),2-s2.0-85031505260

Patients and methods We analyzed data from patients with TESCC who were enrolled in the Taiwan Cancer Registry database. To compare treatment outcomes, the patients were categorized into two groups according to their radiotherapy doses: group 1, who received CCRT < 60 Gy with IMRT, and group 2, who received CCRT ? 60 Gy with IMRT. Group 1 was used as the control for investigating posttreatment mortality risk. Results We enrolled 2061 patients with TESCC without distant metastasis who received CCRT with IMRT. Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that advanced clinical American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage (?IIIA), alcohol consumption, and cigarette smoking were significant, poor independent predictors in patients with TESCC receiving IMRT-based CCRT. IMRT-based CCRT (?60 Gy; adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.63–0.83) was a significant independent prognostic factor for overall survival (P < 0.0001). After adjustment for confounders, the aHRs (95% CIs) for overall mortality at all clinical stages were 0.75 (0.68–0.83, P < 0.0001) in group 2. In group 2, the aHRs (95% CIs) for overall mortality at early (IA–IIB) and advanced (IIIA–IIIC) AJCC clinical stages were 0.89 (0.70–1.04, P = 0.1905) and 0.75 (0.67–0.83, P < 0.0001), respectively. Conclusion Compared with standard-dose IMRT-based CCRT, high-dose IMRT-based CCRT yields more favorable survival outcomes in patients with advanced-stage TESCC. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Dose escalation; Intensity-modulated radiotherapy; Squamous cell carcinoma; Thoracic esophageal cancer,"antineoplastic agent; adult; advanced cancer; alcohol consumption; Article; cancer mortality; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer registry; cancer staging; cancer survival; chemoradiotherapy; cohort analysis; esophageal squamous cell carcinoma; female; follow up; human; intensity modulated radiation therapy; low energy radiation; major clinical study; male; middle aged; mortality rate; mortality risk; overall survival; priority journal; radiation dose distribution; radiation dose escalation; radiation pneumonia; smoking; Taiwan; thorax cancer; treatment outcome; aged; chemoradiotherapy; esophagus tumor; factual database; intensity modulated radiation therapy; multivariate analysis; pathology; proportional hazards model; radiation response; squamous cell carcinoma; thorax; Adult; Aged; Carcinoma, Squamous Cell; Chemoradiotherapy; Cohort Studies; Databases, Factual; Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; Esophageal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Neoplasm Staging; Proportional Hazards Models; Radiotherapy, Intensity-Modulated; Thorax; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-85029519231

Ten-second whole-hand-grasps action was chosen to assess bradykinesia severity in this study. A quantification assessment system based on a self-developed wearable device was proposed to assess the severity of the parkinsonian bradykinesia. The proposed assessment method used an attitude-estimation algorithm to extract the parkinsonian bradykinesia parameters. A regression model was adopted to fit the characteristic parameters with the clinical UPDRS ratings judged by neurologists. Clinical experiment with 15 PD patients and 5 age-matched healthy controls demonstrated that the predicted bradykinesia scores by proposed model correlated well with the judgments of neurologists (r2=0.99). The proposed quantification model demonstrated the greater goodness-of-fit compared with the related works. ? 2017 IEEE.,,electronic device; hand; hand strength; human; hypokinesia; Parkinson disease; Hand; Hand Strength; Humans; Hypokinesia; Parkinson Disease; Wearable Electronic Devices,2-s2.0-85032203634

Although this disease is curable and preventable, yet many new tuberculosis cases still occur especially in developing countries. Many low-income families cannot afford the medical diagnosis for tuberculosis. Therefore, this paper proposes an initial screening for tuberculosis infection using a data mining approach. In this paper, the initial screening is conducted using classification method developed from non-linear support vector machine and gradient evolution algorithm. Herein, the gradient evolution algorithm is able to find the best parameter setting for the support vector machine algorithm. The classification is performed based on some information which can be easily collected without medical test. The proposed algorithm is also compared with some other metaheuristic-based support vector machine algorithms. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm has promising results shown by the small error rate. In addition, a C5.0 decision tree is employed to further analyze the rules of TB infection. The result reveals that people who are protected with vaccine still possible to be infected by tuberculosis, especially if there is direct contact with an active tuberculosis patient. Furthermore, people with low body mass index and low education has higher risk to get tuberculosis infection. The result of this study could help people conduct self-diagnosis for the tuberculosis infection before deciding to do a medical test. ? 2017 IEEE.",classification; decision tree; gradient evolution algorithm; support vector machine; Tuberculosis,Application programs; Classification (of information); Computer software; Decision trees; Developing countries; Diagnosis; Evolutionary algorithms; Support vector machines; Trees (mathematics); Tubes (components); Vectors; Classification methods; Gradient evolution; Parameter setting; Screening methods; Support vector machine algorithm; Tuberculosis; Tuberculosis infection; Tuberculosis patients; Data mining,2-s2.0-85032862062

In animal experiments, lactobacilli have been shown to inhibit obesity by modifying the gut microbiota, controlling inflammation and influencing the associated gene expression. A previous study found that high-fat-diet-induced (HFD) obesity was suppressed by lactobacilli ingestion in rats via the inhibition of parasympathetic nerve activity. This study explored the combined use of lactobacilli ingestion and ultrasound (US) to control body weight and body fat deposition in HFD mice over an 8-week experimental period. Male C57BL/6J mice received an HFD during treatment and were randomly divided into four groups: (i) control group (H), (ii) lactobacilli alone (HB), (iii) US alone (HU) and (iv) lactobacilli combined with US (HUB). The US was targeted at the inguinal portion of the epididymal fat pad on the right side. At the 8th?week, body weight had decreased significantly in the HUB group (15.56?±?1.18%, mean?±?SD) group compared with the HU (26.63?±?0.96%) and H (32.62?±?5.03%) groups (p?<?0.05). High-resolution microcomputed tomography (micro-CT) scans revealed that the reduction in total body fat volume was significantly greater in the HUB group (69%) than in the other two experimental groups (HB, 52%; HU, 37%; p?<?0.05). The reductions in the thickness of the subcutaneous epididymal fat pads were significantly greater in the HUB group (final thickness: 340?±?7?μm) than in the H (final thickness: 1150?±?21?μm), HB (final thickness: 1060?±?18?μm) and HU (final thickness: 370?±?5?μm) groups (all p?<?0.05). Combination therapy with lactobacilli and US appears to enhance the reduction in body weight, total and local body fat deposition, adipocyte size and plasma lipid levels over an 8-week period over that achieved with lactobacilli or US alone in HFD mice. These results indicate that US treatment alone can reduce hyperlipidemia in HFD mice.

An ultrasound image tracking algorithm (UITA) was used to retrieve the displacement data of the tracking target and reproduce the diaphragm motion in real time using a red laser to irradiate the diaphragm phantom in vitro. This study also recorded the respiration patterns in 10 volunteers. Both simulated and the respiration patterns in 10 human volunteers signals were input to the RSS for conducting experiments involving the reproduction of diaphragm motion in vitro using the IVDMRS. The reproduction accuracy of the IVDMRS was calculated and analyzed. The results indicate that the respiration frequency substantially affects the correlation between ultrasound and kV images, as well as the reproduction accuracy of the IVDMRS due to the system delay time (0.35?s) of ultrasound imaging and signal transmission. The utilization of a phase lead compensator (PLC) reduced the error caused by this delay, thereby improving the reproduction accuracy of the IVDMRS by 14.09–46.98%. Applying the IVDMRS in clinical treatments will allow medical staff to monitor the target displacements in real time by observing the movement of the laser beam. If the target displacement moves outside the planning target volume (PTV), the treatment can be immediately stopped to ensure that healthy tissues do not receive high doses of radiation. ? 2017 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica",In vitro diagnostic methods; In vitro diaphragm motion reproduction system (IVDMRS); Radiation therapy; Real-time image tracking,"algorithm; Article; breathing pattern; breathing rate; diaphragm movement; human; human experiment; image analysis; imaging phantom; imaging software; imaging system; in vitro diaphragm motion reproduction system; in vitro study; information retrieval; irradiation; laser; measurement accuracy; measurement error; normal human; real time echography; real time tracking system; reproducibility; respiratory system; signal processing; ultrasound image tracking algorithm; volunteer; breathing; diaphragm; echography; imaging phantom; movement (physiology); physiology; Diaphragm; Humans; Movement; Phantoms, Imaging; Respiration; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-85023181050

This study investigates such interactions using fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) coated with vaccinia envelope proteins as the model system. To achieve this goal, we noncovalently conjugated 100 nm FNDs with rA27(aa 21-84), a recombinant envelope protein of vaccinia virus, for glycosaminoglycans (GAGs)-specific targeting and imaging of living cells. Another recombinant protein rDA27(aa 33-84) that removes the GAGs-binding sequences was also used for comparison. Three types of A27-coated FNDs were generated, including rA27(aa 21-84)-FND, rDA27(aa 33-84)-FND, and hybrid rA27(aa 21-84)/rDA27(aa 33-84)-FND. The specificity of these viral protein-FND conjugates toward GAGs binding was examined by flow cytometry, fluorescence microscopy, and gel electrophoresis. Results obtained for normal and GAGs-deficient cells showed that the recombinant proteins maintain their GAG-targeting activities even after immobilization on the FND surface.

Methods: Diaphragm motions and various respiration patterns were tracked and captured in volunteers using our previously developed UITA (Kuo et al., J Xray Sci Technol, 2016:875). A diaphragm phantom was placed on a respiration simulation system (RSS) that received signals with different respiration patterns to simulate actual human respiration signals. The RSS was mounted on the RCS, which is 180 cm long and driven by inputting a compensating signal to a linear actuator underneath with and without using a phase-lead compensator (PLC) (Chuang et al., J Xray Sci Technol, 2015:503). The target displacement was calculated automatically by the UITA and compensated by the RCS. The phantom displacements were observed using a fluoroscopic imaging system on the linear accelerator at the Department of Radiation Oncology, Taipei Medical University Hospital, and the results were also compared with the displacements measured by the UITA and the RSS for correlation verification. In addition, the compensating effect was analyzed after activating the RCS. Results: The experimental results indicate a significant correlation between the UITA-calculated and actual displacements, with a correlation coefficient of up to 91% for the simulated respiration patterns. After activating the RCS, the obtained compensating effect was more than 65%, and even up to 85% if a PLC was used. Moreover, the compensation of 10 extreme respiration patterns of diaphragm was improved significantly through the use of a PLC, with a peak compensating rate of 88.92% being achieved. Finally, compensation effects ranging from 52% to 74% were obtained in 10 human volunteers. Conclusions: This study combined ultrasound imaging tracking technology with the RCS to offset the respiration-induced diaphragm displacement and compensate the various respiration patterns, even including those with baseline-shift phenomenon in real time with the aid of a noninvasive ultrasound imaging system. ? 2017 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.",Baseline shift; Organ motion; Real-time tracking; Respiration compensating system; Ultrasound image,"Article; automatic respiration compensating system; automation; breathing pattern; breathing rate; comparative study; controlled study; diaphragm movement; feasibility study; fluoroscopy system; human; image analysis; image processing; imaging phantom; imaging software; linear accelerator; phase lead compensator; real time echography; real time tracking system; respiration simulation system; respiratory equipment; ultrasound image tracking algorithm; algorithm; breathing; diagnostic imaging; echography; imaging phantom; lung; motion; Algorithms; Humans; Lung; Motion; Phantoms, Imaging; Respiration; Ultrasonography",2-s2.0-85024397974

Methods Image processing techniques were used to analyze the computed tomography of lung cancer, locate the tumor, and calculate the tumor volume. The medical indicator was then evaluated and analyzed. We examined the correlation between reduced tumor volume and survival duration of 88 patients after chemotherapy at Tri-Service General Hospital, Taiwan. The innovative survival prediction index was obtained by four statistical methods: receiver operating characteristic curve, Youden index, Kaplan-Meier method, and log rank test. Results From the image processing techniques, tumor volume from each patient were obtained within an average of 7.25 seconds. The proposed method was shown to achieve rapid positioning of lung tumors and volume reconstruction with an estimation error of 1.92% when calibrated with an irregularly shaped stone. In medical indicator evaluation and analysis, the area below the receiver operating characteristic curve is greater than 0.8, indicating good predictability of the medical index used herein. The Youden index spotted the best cut-off point of volume, and the correlation between the volume's cut-off point and survival time was confirmed again by Kaplan-Meier and log rank test. The p-values were all less than 0.05, presenting a high degree of correlation between the two, indicating that this medical indicator is highly reliable. Conclusions The proposed techniques can automatically find the location of tumors in the lung, reconstruct the volume, and calculate changes in volume before and after treatment, thus obtaining an innovative survival prediction index. This will help facilitate early and accurate predictions of disease outcomes during the course of therapy, and categorize patient stratification into risk groups for more efficient therapies. ? 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Active contour without edges; Chemotherapy; Lung cancer; Non-small lung cancer; Weighted fuzzy-C means,"Biological organs; Chemotherapy; Computerized tomography; Disease control; Diseases; Forecasting; Image processing; Tomography; Tumors; Active contour without edges; Degree of correlations; Image processing technique; Indicator evaluations; Lung Cancer; Receiver operating characteristic curves; Volume reconstruction; Weighted fuzzy c-means; Patient treatment; cisplatin; pemetrexed; tumor marker; adult; advanced cancer; aged; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer localization; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; female; human; image processing; image reconstruction; image segmentation; Kaplan Meier method; log rank test; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; receiver operating characteristic; retrospective study; survival prediction; survival rate; survival time; tumor volume; very elderly; Youden index; diagnostic imaging; lung; lung tumor; prognosis; Taiwan; x-ray computed tomography; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lung; Lung Neoplasms; Prognosis; Taiwan; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Tumor Burden",2-s2.0-85016941591

Methods: We genotyped MTHFR polymorphisms C677T (rs1801133) and A1298C (rs1801131) for 498 CRC patients treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy after receiving surgery. Survival analyses on MTHFR polymorphisms were performed using log-rank test and Kaplan–Meier curve. Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between MTHFR genotypes and survival. Results: Overall survival (OS) was significantly longer in CRC patients with MTHFR 677 CT+TT genotypes compared with those with 677 CC genotype (HR 0.77; 95% CI 0.60–0.98). Although the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism was not associated with OS in CRC, this polymorphism was associated with significantly shorter OS in rectal cancer. Among rectal cancer patients, OS was shorter for patients with AC+CC genotypes than for those with the AA genotype (HR 1.95; 95% CI 1.35–2.83). In haplotype analysis, better OS was found for colon cancer patients carrying the MTHFR 677T-1298A haplotype (HR 0.73; 95% CI 0.55–0.97), but worse survival was linked to rectal cancer patients carrying the MTHFR 677C-1298C haplotype (HR 1.53; 95% CI 1.08–2.18). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that MTHFR genotypes provide prognostic information for CRC patients treated with 5-FU-based chemotherapy. ? 2016, Japan Society of Clinical Oncology.",5-Fluorouracil; Colorectal cancer; MTHFR; Overall survival; Polymorphisms,"5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (FADH2); fluorouracil; folinic acid; levamisole; tegafur; UFT; fluorouracil; methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (NADPH2); adult; alopecia; Article; cancer chemotherapy; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer surgery; cancer survival; colorectal cancer; colorectal surgery; diarrhea; female; genetic association; genetic polymorphism; genotype; haplotype; human; human tissue; infection; leukopenia; major clinical study; male; nausea; overall survival; priority journal; retrospective study; stomatitis; Taiwan; vomiting; aged; clinical trial; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms; genetics; middle aged; mortality; prognosis; proportional hazards model; Rectal Neoplasms; single nucleotide polymorphism; survival analysis; Aged; Colonic Neoplasms; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Fluorouracil; Haplotypes; Humans; Male; Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NADPH2); Middle Aged; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Prognosis; Proportional Hazards Models; Rectal Neoplasms; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Taiwan",2-s2.0-85007590865

Herein, a novel supramolecular oligomer cytosine (Cy)-polypropylene glycol containing self-complementary multiple hydrogen-bonded Cy moieties is developed, which undergoes spontaneous self-assembly to form nanosized particles in an aqueous environment. Phase transitions and scattering studies confirm that the supramolecular nanogels can be readily tailored to obtain the desired phase-transition temperature and temperature-induced release of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX). The resulting nanogels exhibit an extremely high load carrying capacity (up to 24.8%) and drug-entrapment stability, making the loading processes highly efficient. Importantly, in vitro cytotoxicity assays indicate that DOX-loaded nanogels possess excellent biosafety for drug delivery applications under physiological conditions. When the environmental temperature is increased to 40 °C, DOX-loaded nanogels trigger rapid DOX release and exert cytotoxic effects, significantly reducing the dose required compared to free DOX. Given its simplicity, low cost, high reliability, and efficiency, this newly developed temperature-responsive nanocarrier has highly promising potential for controlled release drug delivery systems.

This is due to the higher number of potential contaminants released to the water bodies leading to the potential risks to the human health. Raw water resources, including one river and three reservoirs representative of the major raw water resources in northern and central Taiwan, at four locations were selected to measure turbidity, electrical conductivity (EC), oxidation and reduction potential (ORP), pH, alkalinity, total organic compounds (TOC), zeta potential, particle size, Al, Fe and heavy metal contents. Natural organic matter (NOM) was also examined using high-performance size-exclusion chromatography to distinguish the different molecular weight distribution of organic compounds, such as humic acids, that might affect the subsequent raw water treatment. TOC is highly related to NOM, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5) and chemical oxygen demand, and the influent standard is 4 mg/L in Taiwan. EC, ORP, pH, alkalinity, TOC and zeta potential had values of 231.68–350.60 μS/cm, 210.5–271.55 mV, 8.17–8.58, 65.65–86.25 mg/L, 1.54–2.73 mg/L and –16.58 to –22.60 mV, respectively.

The transpedicular fixator aims to increase stability and enhance the fusion rate. However, how the fused disc and bridged vertebrae respectively affect adjacent-segment diseases progression is not yet clear. Methods Using a validated lumbosacral finite-element model, three variations at the L4–L5 segment were analyzed: 1) moderate disc degeneration, 2) instrumented with a stand-alone cage and pedicle screw fixators, and 3) with the cage only after fusion. The intersegmental angles, disc stresses, and facet loads were examined. Four motion tests, flexion, extension, bending, and twisting, were also simulated. Findings The adjacent-segment disease was more severe at the cephalic segment than the caudal segment. After solid fusion and fixation, the increase in intersegmental angles, disc stresses and facet loads of the adjacent segments were about 57.6%, 47.3%, and 59.6%, respectively. However, these changes were reduced to 30.1%, 22.7%, and 27.0% after removal of the fixators. This was attributed to the differences between the biomechanical characteristics of the fusion and fixation mechanisms. Interpretation Fixation superimposes a stiffer constraint on the mobility of the bridged segment than fusion. The current study suggested that the removal of spinal fixators after complete fusion could decrease the stress at adjacent segments. Through a minimally invasive procedure, we could reduce secondary damage to the paraspinal structures while removing the fixators, which is of utmost concern to surgeons. ? 2017 The Authors",Adjacent segment disease; Finite element; Interbody fusion; Spinal fixator,"Bending tests; Biomechanical characteristics; Degenerative disc disease; Fixation mechanisms; Interbody fusion; Lumbosacral Fusion; Minimally invasive; Posterior lumbar interbody fusions; Spinal fixator; Finite element method; Article; biomechanics; device removal; finite element analysis; intervertebral disk degeneration; kinematics; kinetics; mechanical stress; motion; pedicle screw; posterior lumbar interbody fusion; priority journal; simulation; spine fixation device; spine stabilization; device removal; devices; disease exacerbation; finite element analysis; human; internal fixator; joint characteristics and functions; lumbar vertebra; pathophysiology; procedures; sacrum; spine fusion; Biomechanical Phenomena; Device Removal; Disease Progression; Finite Element Analysis; Humans; Internal Fixators; Intervertebral Disc Degeneration; Lumbar Vertebrae; Pedicle Screws; Range of Motion, Articular; Sacrum; Spinal Fusion",2-s2.0-85014052015

The therapy involves using a hypodermic needle and an acupuncture needle to embed 1-cm long catgut segments in an acupoint, enabling the catgut to perform long-term stimulation of the acupoint and achieve the effects of acupuncture treatment. Each therapy process requires numerous repetitions of the same steps, and each needle set can only be used to embed one catgut segment. Additionally, doctors must perform this surgical procedure by hand; no automatic auxiliary instrument has been developed to date. To address these problems, this paper proposes an innovative design of the first automatic ACE auxiliary instrument in the world. The instrument could assist doctors to complete the ACE steps. And it neither requires a battery or external electric power nor changes needles during therapy. The study first involved designing the mechanism and embodiment for the instrument, enabling it to perform one catgut-embedding procedure in only two steps with the repeated use of one needle set. We then created the prototype and tested its functionality in terms of the success rate of catgut cutting, average length of catgut segments, the success rate of needle insertion and acupoint range, and the success rates of catgut insertion and catgut embedding. The results showed that the prototype did conform to our design goals, but the success rates of catgut cutting and catgut insertion could be further enhanced. ? 2017 by ASME.",Acupuncture; Medical device; Surgical robotics; Surgical tool,Acupuncture; Biomedical equipment; Design; Medicine; Needles; Robotic surgery; Surgery; Embedding procedures; Hypodermic needles; Medical Devices; Medical instruments; Surgical procedures; Surgical robotics; Surgical tools; Traditional Chinese Medicine; Surgical equipment; acupuncture needle; Article; automation; catgut embedding; equipment design; human; hypodermic needle; motion,2-s2.0-85010888127

Herein, we demonstrate a novel supramolecular poly(ε-caprolactone) (PCL) containing self-complementary sextuple hydrogen-bonded uracil-diamidopyridine (U-DPy) moieties, which undergoes spontaneous self-assembly to form supramolecular polymer networks. Inclusion of various U-DPy contents enhanced the mechanical strength and viscosities of the resulting materials by up to two orders of magnitude compared to control PCL. Surface wettability and morphological studies confirmed physically-crosslinked films can be readily tailored to provide the desired surface properties. Cell viability assays indicated the excellent in vitro biocompatibility of U-DPy-functionalized substrates and indicate the potential of these materials for various biomedical applications. More importantly, mouse fibroblast NIH/3T3 cells cultured on these substrates displayed a more elongated cell morphology and had substantially higher cell densities than cells seeded on control PCL substrate, which indicates that introduction of U-DPy moieties into polymer matrixes could be used to create tissue culture surfaces that enhance cell attachment and proliferation. This new system is suggested as a potential route towards the practical realization of next-generation tissue-engineering scaffolds. Statement of Significance In this study, we report a significant breakthrough in development of self-assembled supramolecular polymers to form well-defined scaffolds through self-complementary hydrogen-bonding interactions. These newly developed materials exhibited extremely good mechanical properties, fine-tunable hydrophilic characteristics and excellent biocompatibility due to hydrogen-bond-induced physical cross-linking. Importantly, cell adhesion and proliferation assays indicated that these substrates efficiently promoted the growth of mouse embryonic fibroblasts NIH/3T3 cells in vitro. Thus, this finding provides a simple and effective route for the development of next-generation tissue-engineering scaffolds that have improved mechanical properties, increased surface hydrophilicity and can enhance the growth and biological activity of adherent cells. ? 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.",Bioactive scaffolds; Multiple hydrogen bonds; Self-assembly; Supramolecular chemistry; Tissue engineering,"polycaprolactone; cross linking reagent; polycaprolactone; polyester; polymer; pyridine derivative; uracil; water; 3T3 cell line; animal experiment; Article; biocompatibility; cell adhesion; cell density; cell proliferation; cell structure; cell viability assay; controlled study; crystal structure; differential scanning calorimetry; hydrogen bond; hydrophilicity; in vitro study; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; supramolecular chemistry; surface property; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; viscosity; wettability; animal; cell adhesion; cell proliferation; cell survival; chemistry; cytology; fibroblast; flow kinetics; human; NIH 3T3 cell line; small angle scattering; tumor cell line; X ray diffraction; Animals; Cell Adhesion; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Cross-Linking Reagents; Fibroblasts; Humans; Hydrogen Bonding; Mice; NIH 3T3 Cells; Polyesters; Polymers; Pyridines; Rheology; Scattering, Small Angle; Uracil; Water; X-Ray Diffraction",2-s2.0-85009275015

We aimed to define the LAD region (LADR) with adequate inclusion of the LAD and DBs and contouring consistency. Methods and materials The LADR was defined using coronary CT angiograms. The inclusion ratio was used to assess the LAD and DBs inclusion by the LADR. Four radiation oncologists delineated the LAD and LADR, using contrast-enhanced CT of 15 patients undergoing left breast radiotherapy. The S?rensen–Dice similarity index (DSI), Jaccard similarity index (JSI), and Hausdorff distance (HD) were calculated to assess similarity. The mean dose (Dmean) and maximum dose (Dmax) to the LAD and LADR were calculated to compare consistency. Correlations were evaluated using Pearson's correlation coefficient. Results The inclusion ratio of the LAD by the LADR was 96%. The mean DSI, JSI, and HD values were respectively 27.9%, 16.7%, and 0.42?mm for the LAD, and 83.1%, 73.0%, and 0.18?mm for the LADR. The Dmean between the LAD and LADR were strongly correlated (r?=?0.93). Conclusion Delineation of the LADR significantly improved contouring similarity and consistency for dose reporting. This could optimize dose estimation for breast radiotherapy. ? 2017 Elsevier Ireland Ltd",Coronary artery; Left breast cancer; Radiotherapy,"iopromide; Article; bolus injection; breast cancer; cancer radiotherapy; cancer surgery; clinical article; computed tomographic angiography; contrast enhancement; coronary angiography; early cancer; female; Hausdorff distance; human; Jaccard similarity index; left anterior descending coronary artery; medical parameters; partial mastectomy; priority journal; radiation oncologist; radiotherapy dosage; retrospective study; Sorensen Dice similarity index; aged; Breast Neoplasms; coronary blood vessel; diagnostic imaging; middle aged; organs at risk; patient positioning; procedures; radiotherapy planning system; Aged; Breast Neoplasms; Computed Tomography Angiography; Coronary Vessels; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Organs at Risk; Patient Positioning; Radiotherapy Dosage; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted",2-s2.0-85009174525

Ag+ altered the optical properties of the host QDs, whereas the spin magnetic moment (S?=?5/2) of Mn2+ efficiently induced the longitudinal relaxation of water protons. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of the aqueous synthesis of color-tunable AgMn:In2S3/ZnS core/shell QDs with magnetic properties. The synthetic procedure is rapid, facile, reproducible, and scalable. The obtained QDs offered a satisfactory quantum yield (45%), high longitudinal relaxivity (6.84?s?1?mM?1), and robust photostability. In addition, they exhibited excellent stability over a wide pH range (5–12) and high ionic strength (0.15–2.0?M NaCl). As seen by confocal microscopy and magnetic resonance imaging, AgMn:In2S3/ZnS conjugated to hyaluronic acid (referred to as AgMn:In2S3/ZnS@HA) efficiently and specifically targeted cluster determinant 44, a receptor overexpressed on cancer cells. Moreover, AgMn:In2S3/ZnS@HA showed negligible cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo, rendering it a promising diagnostic probe for dual-modal imaging in clinical applications. Statement of Significance In this manuscript, we reported a facial and rapid method to prepare In2S3/ZnS core/shell quantum dots (QDs) co-doped with Ag+ and Mn2+ (referred to as AgMn:In2S3/ZnS). Ag+ dopants were used to alter the optical properties of the In2S3 host, whereas Mn2+ co-dopants with their unpaired electrons provided paramagnetic properties. The emission wavelength of the core/shell QDs could be tuned from 550 to 743?nm with a maximum PL quantum yield of 45%. The resulting core/shell QDs also maintained a stable emission in aqueous solution at broad ranges of pH (5?12) and ionic strength (0.15–2.0?M NaCl), as well as a high photostability under continuous irradiation. In vivo cytotoxicity experiments showed that up to 500?μg/mL AgMn:In2S3/ZnS@HA did not cause obvious toxicity to zebrafish embryos. In vitro targeted cell luminescence and magnetic resonance imaging showed that AgMn:In2S3/ZnS conjugated to hyaluronic acid was selectively and efficiently internalized in CD44-expressing tumor cells, confirming that the resultant QDs could function as dual-modal imaging probes for accurate diagnosis. ? 2016 Acta Materialia Inc.",Hyaluronic acid; In2S3; Luminescence probe; Quantum dots; T1-weighted images,"chromium; copper; Hermes antigen; hyaluronic acid; indium; manganese; nickel; quantum dot; silver; sulfur; zinc; zinc sulfide; colloid; indium; manganese; quantum dot; silver; sulfide; water; zinc derivative; zinc sulfide; adult; animal cell; Article; confocal laser scanning microscopy; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; endocytosis; female; flow cytometry; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; in vitro study; ionic strength; male; melanoma; mouse; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; pH; priority journal; quantum yield; synthesis; zebra fish; animal; cell death; chemistry; colloid; experimental melanoma; light related phenomena; magnetism; three dimensional imaging; ultrastructure; ultraviolet spectrophotometry; Animals; Cell Death; Colloids; HeLa Cells; Humans; Hyaluronic Acid; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Indium; Magnetics; Manganese; Melanoma, Experimental; Optical Phenomena; Quantum Dots; Silver; Spectrophotometry, Ultraviolet; Sulfides; Water; Zebrafish; Zinc Compounds",2-s2.0-85008324703

However, the extant literature is inconclusive regarding the nature of the relationship shared by the different attributes of psychosocial well-being and Intensity of Facebook Use (IFU). Furthermore, the prior literature has also revealed inconsistent findings concerning this relationship. To address this gap, this study investigated the significant role of different attributes of psychosocial well-being associated with Facebook use, namely civic-political participation, satisfaction of life, bridging and bonding of social capital, and online sociability on IFU. A total of four cross-sectional surveys were undertaken with adolescent and young-adult Facebook users from India over a period of one year. The results suggest that online sociability was the strongest, and life satisfaction was a non-significant predictor of IFU of both adolescents and young adults across all four studies. The bonding and bridging of social capital was a significant predictor of the IFU of high social economic condition (SES) adolescents, unlike young adults. Furthermore, bridging was, but bonding of social capital was not, a significant predictor of the IFU of low SES adolescents. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Adolescents; Bonding and bridging of social capital; Cross-sectional survey; Intensive Facebook use; Life satisfaction; Online sociability and young adults,Occupational diseases; Surveys; Adolescents; Cross-sectional surveys; Facebook; Life satisfaction; Social capitals; Young adults; Social networking (online); adolescent; adult; case report; chemical binding; human; India; life satisfaction; political participation; social capital; wellbeing; young adult,2-s2.0-85006428039

Methods: Data were obtained from the National Health Insurance Research Dataset of Taiwan. Patients receiving flunarizine or cinnarizine for more than 1?month between 2000 and 2005 were enrolled. Exclusion criteria included receiving flunarizine, cinnarizine, or antipsychotics for more than 1?month during 1997–1999, a history of neurodegenerative diseases, and an age of less than 30?years. One matched control for each patient was selected. Each participant was followed for diagnosis of parkinsonism within a 3-year observation period. Stroke, diabetes mellitus, total prescription days, and doses of flunarizine or cinnarizine were recorded. Results: The study and control groups consisted of 9830 subjects. In the study group, 280 patients (2.9?%) were diagnosed with parkinsonism with a median observation period of 1.2?years, and 49 participants (0.5?%) were diagnosed in the control group with a median observation period of 1.9?years. The adjusted hazard ratio for parkinsonism among patients receiving flunarizine and cinnarizine was 5.117 (95?% CI?=?3.758–6.967). Age, stroke, and diabetes mellitus were significant risk factors, but female sex and total doses of the study drugs were not. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that flunarizine and cinnarizine significantly increase the risk for parkinsonism. The treatment benefits of these two agents should be balanced with this adverse effect. Physicians must look carefully for early signs of parkinsonism in patients treated with flunarizine and cinnarizine. ? 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Cinnarizine; Drug-induced parkinsonism; Flunarizine; Health insurance research dataset; Parkinsonism,"cinnarizine; flunarizine; cinnarizine; flunarizine; adult; age; aged; Article; cerebrovascular accident; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; female; follow up; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; parkinsonism; patient selection; population based case control study; prescription; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; retrospective study; risk factor; Taiwan; treatment duration; very elderly; case control study; middle aged; Parkinsonian Disorders; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Case-Control Studies; Cinnarizine; Female; Flunarizine; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinsonian Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-85006364841

However, complicated technology, expensive cost, environmental pollution and low-efficient output have limited its development. Herein, based on periodic contact/separation between human skin and the microstructured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) film, we demonstrate a transparent flexible triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) through a relatively simple, low-cost, environmental-friendly and high-efficient method. For the first time, the natural leaves with rich surface textures were introduced to make microstructures on PDMS films as effective friction surface in the TENG. Furthermore, long silver nanowires (200 ?m in length at least) through novel synthesis were assembled as high-performance electrode, resulting in the entirely flexible and transparent TENG. Owing to the unique design, the transparent flexible TENG was eventually obtained with an enhanced output (Voc=56 V; Isc=3.1 μA) and remarkable transparency (88%). Owing to compelling features of the TENG, a self-powered user-interactive wearable system was successfully established by integrating a flexible electrochromic device (ECD). The remarkable color-tunable ability via mechanical control of our system, highly inspired by chameleons, is potentially useful in military camouflage, monitoring human activity visually, as well as replacing performance of face change in Sichuan Opera. Therefore, this research is a substantial advancement toward the construction of transparent nanogenerator and its multifunctional applications in energy conversation, wearable electronics, healthcare, culture experience, and even environmental protection. ? 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Bio-inspired; Environmental-friendly; Leaf-molded; Silver nanowires; Transparent; Triboelectric generator,Electric equipment protection; Electric resistance measurement; Electrostatic generators; Environmental technology; Microchannels; Microstructure; Nanotechnology; Nanowires; Optoelectronic devices; Polydimethylsiloxane; Silicones; Silver; Triboelectricity; Wearable technology; Bio-inspired; Environmental-friendly; Leaf-molded; Silver nanowires; Transparent; Tribo-electric generator; Flexible electronics,2-s2.0-85007367765

LDF signals were measured by a moorVMS-LDF device to measure the microcirculatory blood flow flux with a time constant of 0.001?s, a cutoff frequency of 14.9?kHz, and a sampling frequency of 40?Hz. The laser operating wavelength and output power were 400–700?nm and 6?mW, respectively. LDF signals were obtained noninvasively in 115 subjects, who were assigned to three groups (diabetic, prediabetic, and normal) according to the results of the oral glucose tolerance tests. A Morlet mother wavelet transform was applied to the measured 20-min LDF signals, and periodic oscillations with five characteristic frequency peaks were obtained within the following frequency bands: 0.0095–0.02, 0.02–0.06, 0.06–0.15, 0.15–0.4, and 0.4–1.6?Hz (defined as FR1–FR5), respectively.

The REC of FR2–FR3 was significantly smaller in diabetic and prediabetic subjects than in normal subjects. The REC of FR1–FR3 from normal to prediabetic and diabetic subjects showed a progressive decrease.

Fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) joined the nanocarbon family in 2005. It was initially developed as a contrast agent for bioimaging because it can emit bright red photoluminescence from negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy centers built in the diamond matrix. A notable application of this technology is to study the cytoplasmic dynamics of living cells by tracking single bioconjugated FNDs in intracellular medium. This article provides a critical review on recent advances and developments of such single particle tracking (SPT) research.

Promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger protein (PLZF) is a transcription factor that can be activated by low-temperature far-infrared (FIR) irradiation to exert beneficial effects on the vascular endothelium. In the present study, we investigated the influence of FIR-induced PLZF activation on AGE-induced endothelial injury both in vitro and in vivo. FIR irradiation inhibited AGE-induced apoptosis in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). PLZF activation increased the expression of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinases (PI3K), which are important kinases in the autophagic signaling pathway. FIR-induced PLZF activation led to autophagy in HUVEC, which was mediated through the upregulation of PI3K. Immunofluorescence staining showed that AGEs were engulfed by HUVECs and localized to lysosomes. FIR-induced autophagy promoted AGEs degradation in HUVECs. In nicotinamide/streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice, FIR therapy reduced serum AGEs and AGEs deposition at the vascular endothelium. FIR therapy also reduced diabetes-induced inflammatory markers in the vascular endothelium and improved vascular endothelial function. These protective effects of FIR therapy were not found in PLZF-knockout mice. Our data suggest that FIR-induced PLZF activation in vascular endothelial cells protects the vascular endothelium in diabetic mice from AGE-induced injury. ?

One challenge faced by the ultra-wideband (UWB) radar-based breast cancer detection is the estimation of clutter-plus-noise covariance matrix. To render a more accurate covariance matrix estimate when the number of samples is not large, this paper presents a new covariance matrix estimate using the shrinkage method. The parameters of the proposed shrinkage-based covariance matrix are cast as a modified semi-definite programming (SDP) problem based on the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) criterion. Moreover, to reduce the computational overhead, we also incorporate the compressive sensing (CS) technique with the above scheme for UWB breast tumor detection. The performance of the Capon beamformer based on the new reconstructed covariance matrix is tested under multistatic scenario by a 2-D numerical breast analysis model. Simulations show that the proposed approach possesses a better target identification capability and improves the signal-To-clutter-noise ratio (SCNR) than the existing counterparts. ? 2017 IEEE.",compressive sensing; covariance matrix estimate; microwave imaging; shrinkage method; UWB,Clutter (information theory); Compressed sensing; Image processing; Imaging systems; Mean square error; Medical imaging; Shrinkage; Tracking radar; Tumors; Ultra-wideband (UWB); Compressive sensing; Computational overheads; Covariance matrix estimation; Microwave imaging; Minimum mean squared error criterions; Noise covariance matrix; Semi-definite programming; Shrinkage methods; Covariance matrix,2-s2.0-85041386427

Conventional rehabilitation programs only emphasize intensive and repeated exercises that do not motivate patients to continue rehabilitation. Using a vibrotactile glove rehabilitation system with a human-computer interaction interface can therefore resolve this issue. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine the potential benefits of this vibrotactile glove rehabilitation system for chronic stroke patients who have already reached the recovery plateau. METHODS: Two interesting computer games were designed to coordinate with the vibrotactile gloves in patient training. The training sessions lasted for about 30 minutes twice a week for five consecutive weeks. We compared finger ROM, grip strength, pinch strength, NHPT, and MHQ results before and after the intervention and surveyed subject satisfaction afterwards. RESULTS: The subjects showed slight improvements in muscle strength and hand after five weeks. The patients reported progress, but the differences did not reach statistical significance. In the satisfaction questionnaire, the subjects gave positive ratings. CONCLUSIONS: This vibrotactile glove rehabilitation system has the potential to help chronic stroke patients who have reached their recovery plateau to make progress and is clinically quite effective in increasing their motivation. ? 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.

In this work, we demonstrated the aqueous synthesis of Gd3+-doped CuInS2/ZnS (CIGS/ZnS) quaternary quantum dots (q-dots), which combine the functions of fluorescence and magnetic resonance imaging, via a microwave method. To enhance the tumor-targeting ability, 3-aminophenyl-boronic acid (APBA) and folic acid (FA) moieties were conjugated with the CIGS/ZnS q-dots, and act as dual-targeting ligands to generate CIGS/ZnS@FA/APBA q-dots. In vitro fluorescence imaging and cellular internalization of such q-dots were scrutinized with confocal microscopy, as well as magnetic resonance imaging, which revealed specifically targeted in vitro delivery into HeLa cells containing abundant sialic acid and overexpression of folate receptors on the cell surfaces. As compared to CdTe quantum dots, the formed CIGS/ZnS@FA/APBA q-dots displayed lower in vitro cytotoxicity for both HeLa and HepG2 cells according to the MTT assay. The results also showed that these q-dots neither induce any noticeable abnormalities, nor affect the survival or hatching rate in the embryonic and larval development of zebrafish. More importantly, fluorescence imaging revealed that CIGS/ZnS q-dots at concentrations up to 1000 μg mL-1 were excreted from the zebrafish without a significant effect on growth. ? 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry and the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.",,copper derivative; folic acid; gadolinium; quantum dot; sialic acid; zinc sulfide; adult; animal experiment; animal model; Article; cancer diagnosis; cell surface; confocal laser scanning microscopy; confocal microscopy; controlled study; cytotoxicity; female; fluorescence imaging; HeLa cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; internalization; malignant neoplasm; molecular imaging; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; photon correlation spectroscopy; priority journal; synthesis; zebra fish,2-s2.0-85034854110

Compared with conventional electronic BP instruments, the novelty of the proposed BP measurement approach is to utilize a variable volume chamber which actively and stably alters the cuff pressure during inflating or deflating cycles. The variable volume chamber is operated with a closed-loop pressure control scheme, and it is activated by controlling the piston position of a single-Acting cylinder driven by a screw motor. Therefore, the variable volume chamber could significantly eliminate the air turbulence disturbance during the air injection stage when compared to an air pump mechanism. Furthermore, the proposed active BP measurement approach is capable of measuring BP characteristics, including systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP), during the inflating cycle. Two modes of air injection measurement (AIM) and accurate dual-way measurement (ADM) were proposed. According to the healthy subject experiment results, AIM reduced 34.21% and ADM reduced 15.78% of the measurement time when compared to a commercial BP monitor. Furthermore, the ADM performed much consistently (i.e., less standard deviation) in the measurements when compared to a commercial BP monitor. ? 2017 Chung-Hsien Kuo et al.",,"Pressure control; Active control schemes; Air turbulence; Diastolic blood pressures; Healthy subjects; Measurement time; Standard deviation; Systolic blood pressure(SBP); Variable volume; Blood pressure; accurate dual way measurement; air injection measurement; Article; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure monitoring; comparative effectiveness; comparative study; diagnostic accuracy; diastolic blood pressure; feedback system; human; mean arterial pressure; oscillometry; signal noise ratio; signal processing; systolic blood pressure; adult; algorithm; blood pressure; devices; diastole; equipment design; normal human; procedures; reproducibility; sphygmomanometer; systole; Adult; Algorithms; Blood Pressure; Blood Pressure Determination; Diastole; Equipment Design; Healthy Volunteers; Humans; Oscillometry; Reproducibility of Results; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Sphygmomanometers; Systole",2-s2.0-85031898113

The association of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and dialysis with suicide is not well established. The objectives of this study were to assess the association of suicide with CKD and dialysis and investigate whether differences exist between dialysis modalities or the durations of dialysis. Methods. Data were obtained from the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 51 642 patients who died from suicide between 2000 and 2012 and 206 568 living control patients matched by age, gender and residency area were examined. Known risk factors included sociodemographic characteristics, physical comorbidities and psychiatric disorders, which were controlled for as covariates in the analysis. The crude odds ratios (ORs) and adjusted ORs (aORs) for various risk factors were obtained using conditional logistic regression. Results. After potential confounders were controlled for, CKD was significantly associated with an increased risk of suicide [aOR = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17-1.34]. Endstage renal disease patients on haemodialysis (HD) had an increased risk of suicide compared with controls (aOR = 3.35, 95% CI = 3.02-3.72). Moreover, patients who initially underwent dialysis within 0-3 months had a significantly increased risk of suicide (aOR = 20.26, 95% CI = 15.99-25.67). Conclusions. CKD and HD are positively associated with suicide. Suicide is preventable; therefore, assessingmental and physical disorders is essential and recommended to all physicians, particularly those treating patients in the early phase of HD. ? 2017 The Author.",CKD; Dialysis; Haemodialysis; Suicide,"adult; age; aged; anxiety disorder; Article; case control study; cerebrovascular disease; chronic kidney failure; chronic obstructive lung disease; comorbidity; controlled study; demography; disease association; drug dependence; end stage renal disease; female; gender; hemodialysis; hemodialysis patient; hepatitis C; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; malignant neoplasm; mental disease; middle aged; mood disorder; priority journal; psychosis; risk factor; social aspect; suicide; treatment duration; young adult; adolescent; chronic kidney failure; factual database; longitudinal study; mental disease; psychology; suicide; Taiwan; trends; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Comorbidity; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Mental Disorders; Middle Aged; Renal Dialysis; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic; Risk Factors; Suicide; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-85029806825

By using the proposed scheme, a person can migrate his/her health records to a specific organization along with access right authorization. In our protocol, the cumulatively notarized signature mechanism is introduced to preserve the evidence on the ownership transfer of targeted electronic health records between two organizations.

Here we have demonstrated a rapid, facile, environmentally friendly, and organic solvent-free method for the synthesis of a gold/gadolinium-doped carbon quantum dot (Au/GdC) nanocomposite for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and photothermal ablation (PTA) therapy. The gadolinium-doped carbon quantum dots (Gd@CQDs) were synthesized using a one-pot, microwave-assisted method, and used as reducing and stabilizing agents to both form the Au/GdC nanocomposite and prevent its agglomeration. Formation of the Au/GdC nanocomposite is achieved by simple mixing of Gd@CQDs and a gold precursor, without the addition of any other reducing agents, surface passivating agents, surfactants, or organic solvents. The Au/GdC nanocomposite shows paramagnetism, surface plasma resonance in the near infrared region (NIR), and excellent photostability. Furthermore, it provides high longitudinal relaxivity (r1 = 13.95 mM-1 s-1), indicating its potential for use as a T1 contrast agent in MRI. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies using HeLa cells and zebrafish embryos as cancer and animal cell models, respectively, confirmed the low toxicity and excellent biocompatibility of the Au/GdC nanocomposite. Notably, our results demonstrate the ability of the Au/GdC nanocomposite to efficiently destroy cancer cells using PTA.

Inductive magnetic heating (hyperthermia)-stimulated drug release, in vitro cellular cytotoxicity assay of curcumin-loaded PEGylated magnetic liposomes and cellular internalization-induced by magnetic guidance would be investigated. The resultant of drug carriers could disperse homogeneously in aqueous solution, showing a superparamagnetic characteristic and could inductive magnetic heating with external high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF). In vitro curcumin release studies confirmed that the drug carriers exhibited no significant release at 37?°C, whereas exhibited rapid releasing at 45?°C. However, it would display enormous (three times higher) curcumin releasing under the HFMF exposure, compared with that without HFMF exposure at 45?°C. In vitro cytotoxicity test shows that curcumin-loaded PEGylated magnetic liposomes could efficiently kill MCF-7 cells in parallel with increasing curcumin concentration. Fluorescence microscopy observed that these drug carriers could internalize efficiently into the cellular compartment of MCF-7 cells.

The aim of the present study was to determine if blood-pressure-waveform (BPW) harmonic indexes can be used to discriminate hemodynamic differences between healthy control subjects and patients with breast cancer. Methods Ten-minute bilateral radial BPW signals were obtained noninvasively in 23 breast-cancer patients and 23 healthy subjects. The amplitude proportion (C n), phase angle (Pn), and harmonic variability (CV n) were calculated for harmonics 1 to 10 of the BPW. Results C 1, C 2, and P 1 were significantly smaller and P7, P9, CV2, and CV3 were significantly larger in the control group than in the cancer group. Conclusion The differences identified between the breast-cancer and control groups illustrate significant hemodynamic changes induced by breast cancer at stages 0-2. The BPW harmonic indexes investigated in this study may be useful for detecting these hemodynamic changes and thus improving the sensitivity of discriminating between healthy controls and patients with early-stage breast cancer.

The GrC model obtains knowledge from information granules rather than from numerical data. It also processes multi-dimensional and sparse data by using singular value decomposition and latent semantic indexing (LSI). The data possessing features of multiple dimensions and scarcity can be preprocessed using LSI in order to reduce the number of data dimensions as well as records. Ten benchmark data sets are employed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. Experiment results indicate that the proposed model has better classification performance with both imbalanced and balanced data. In addition, the computational result for prostate cancer prognosis reveals that the proposed model really can support physicians in judging the condition of prostate cancer patients with a more accurate survival rate estimation. ? 2017 IOS Press and the authors.

The maximum lifting capacity of lift was determined with three independent variables, lifting speed, lifting technique, and lifting height. Questionnaires were evaluated after the experiment by the participants for the lifting speed preferences. This study found that the lifting speed was a significant factor in the lifting capacity (p <0.001); and the lifting height (p<0.001) and the interaction of lifting speed and lifting height (p=0.005) affected the lifting capacity significantly. The maximal lifting capacity was achieved around the optimal speed that was neither too fast nor too slow. Moreover, the participants’ preferred lifting speeds were consistently close to the optimal lifting speed. The results showed that the common lifting practice guideline to lift slowly might make the worker unable to generate a large lifting capacity. ? 2017 National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health.",Lifting capacity; Lifting pace; Lifting speed; Low back pain,adverse effects; biomechanics; body position; human; low back pain; male; pathophysiology; physiology; questionnaire; time factor; Humans; Lifting; Low Back Pain; Male; Posture; Surveys and Questionnaires; Time Factors,2-s2.0-85011842194

A set of academic articles retrieved from the Web of Science database is used as the basis for uncovering the recent themes. We begin the analysis by constructing a citation network which is further separated into groups after applying a widely used clustering method. The resulting clusters all consist of articles coherent in citation relationships. This study suggests eight fast growing recent themes. They span widely encompassing politics, romantic relationships, public relations, journalism, and health. Among them, four focus their issues largely on Twitter, three on Facebook, and one generally on both. While discussions on traditional issues in SNSs such as personality, motivations, self-disclosure, narcissism, etc. continue to lead the pack, the proliferation of the highlighted recent themes in the near future is very likely to happen. ? 2017 Liu et al.

Stroboscope has been widely used around the world. However, without quantized indices, physicians can only make subjective judgment on glottal images. We designed a new laser projection marking module and applied it onto the laryngeal video stroboscope to provide scale conversion reference parameters for glottal imaging and to convert the physiological parameters of glottis. Image processing technology was used to segment the important image regions of interest. Information of the glottis was quantified, and the vocal fold image segmentation system was completed to assist clinical diagnosis and increase accuracy. Regarding image processing, histogram equalization was used to enhance glottis image contrast. The center weighted median filters image noise while retaining the texture of the glottal image. Statistical threshold determination was used for automatic segmentation of a glottal image. As the glottis image contains saliva and light spots, which are classified as the noise of the image, noise was eliminated by erosion, expansion, disconnection, and closure techniques to highlight the vocal area. We also used image processing to automatically identify an image of vocal fold region in order to quantify information from the glottal image, such as glottal area, vocal fold perimeter, vocal fold length, glottal width, and vocal fold angle. The quantized glottis image database was created to assist physicians in diagnosing glottis diseases more objectively. ?

However, cases of failure still exist, notably caused by restenosis and thrombus formation. Aiming to solve these problems, various approaches to surface modification of synthetic vascular grafts have been used to improve both the hemocompatibility and long-term patency of artificial vascular grafts. Surface modification using hydrophilic molecules can enhance hemocompatibility, but this may limit the initial vascular endothelial cell adhesion. Therefore, the improvement of endothelialization on these grafts with specific peptides and biomolecules is now an exciting field of research. In this review, several techniques to improve surface modification and endothelialization on vascular grafts, mainly polyurethane (PU) grafts, are summarized, together with the recent development and evolution of the different strategies: from the use of PEG, zwitterions, and polysaccharides to peptides and other biomolecules and genes; from in vitro endothelialization to in vivo endothelialization; and from bio-inert and bio-active to bio-mimetic approaches. ?

Algorithms for stroke lesion segmentation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes are intensely researched, but the reported results are largely incomparable due to different datasets and evaluation schemes. We approached this urgent problem of comparability with the Ischemic Stroke Lesion Segmentation (ISLES) challenge organized in conjunction with the MICCAI 2015 conference. In this paper we propose a common evaluation framework, describe the publicly available datasets, and present the results of the two sub-challenges: Sub-Acute Stroke Lesion Segmentation (SISS) and Stroke Perfusion Estimation (SPES). A total of 16 research groups participated with a wide range of state-of-the-art automatic segmentation algorithms. A thorough analysis of the obtained data enables a critical evaluation of the current state-of-the-art, recommendations for further developments, and the identification of remaining challenges. The segmentation of acute perfusion lesions addressed in SPES was found to be feasible. However, algorithms applied to sub-acute lesion segmentation in SISS still lack accuracy. Overall, no algorithmic characteristic of any method was found to perform superior to the others. Instead, the characteristics of stroke lesion appearances, their evolution, and the observed challenges should be studied in detail. The annotated ISLES image datasets continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system to serve as an ongoing benchmarking resource (www.isles-challenge.org). ? 2016",Benchmark; Challenge; Comparison; Ischemic stroke; MRI; Segmentation,"Benchmarking; Diagnosis; Image segmentation; Automatic segmentations; Cerebrovascular disease; Challenge; Comparison; Ischemic strokes; Lesion segmentations; Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI); Online evaluation systems; Magnetic resonance imaging; gadobutrol; Article; automation; brain hemorrhage; brain ischemia; classification algorithm; digital subtraction angiography; hemispheric dominance; human; ischemic stroke lesion segmentation; major clinical study; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; observer variation; perfusion weighted imaging; priority journal; quality control; tumor localization; algorithm; benchmarking; cerebrovascular accident; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; procedures; Algorithms; Benchmarking; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Stroke",2-s2.0-84979950799

The NP delivery system was obtained from assembly of poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid)-grafted hyaluronic acid (HA-g-PLGA) together with an anticancer drug, SN38, in aqueous phase, followed by implementing the NP surface with a layer of methoxypoly(ethylene glycol)-b-poly(histamine methacrylamide) (mPEG-b-PHMA) via hydrophobic association to improve the colloidal stability both in vitro and in vivo. Upon arrival of these PEGylated NPs at the acidic tumor site through the EPR effect, mPEG-b-PHMA became detached from the NP surface by the charge transition of the PHMA blocks from neutral (hydrophobic) to positively charged (hydrophilic) state via acid-induced protonation of their imidazole groups in tumor microenvironment. The exposure of HA shell on the naked NP thus resulted in enhanced uptake of NPs by CD44-expressed tumor cells, including cancer cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Along with the TAMs being further chemotactically recruited by hypoxia cells, the engulfed nanotherapeutics was thus transported into the avascular area in which the anticancer action of chemotherapy occurred by virtue of the drug release alongside PLGA degradation, similar to those arising in other tumor nonhypoxia regions. ? 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Cells; Chemotherapy; Cytology; Ethylene; Ethylene glycol; Hyaluronic acid; Hydrophobicity; Lactic acid; Motion Picture Experts Group standards; Nanoparticles; Anticancer actions; Colloidal Stability; Drug delivery strategies; Hydrophobic association; Nanoparticle (NPs); Poly(lactic acid-co-glycolic acid); Tumor associated macrophages; Tumor microenvironment; Tumors; firtecan; Hermes antigen; hyaluronic acid; imidazole; irinotecan; nanoparticle; polyglactin; antineoplastic agent; camptothecin; hyaluronic acid; nanoparticle; polyester; polyglycolic acid; polylactide; animal cell; animal model; animal tissue; apoptosis; Article; cancer cell; cancer inhibition; cell survival; cell viability; controlled study; degradation; drug selectivity; hypoxic cell; in vitro study; in vivo study; malignant neoplastic disease; mouse; nanopharmaceutics; nonhuman; priority journal; quantitative analysis; synthesis; tumor associated leukocyte; tumor microenvironment; analogs and derivatives; animal; C57BL mouse; chemistry; cytology; drug delivery system; drug effects; macrophage; male; pathology; Prostatic Neoplasms; tumor cell culture; tumor microenvironment; Animals; Antineoplastic Agents, Phytogenic; Camptothecin; Cell Survival; Drug Delivery Systems; Hyaluronic Acid; Macrophages; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nanoparticles; Polyesters; Polyglycolic Acid; Prostatic Neoplasms; Tumor Cells, Cultured; Tumor Microenvironment",2-s2.0-85006070878

Several studies on how increasing Internet use affected outpatient clinic visits were inconclusive. Objective: The objective of this study was to examine the role of Internet use on ambulatory care-seeking behaviors as indicated by the number of outpatient clinic visits after adjusting for confounding variables. Methods: We conducted this study using a sample randomly selected from the general population in Taiwan. To handle the missing data, we built a multivariate logistic regression model for propensity score matching using age and sex as the independent variables. The questionnaires with no missing data were then included in a multivariate linear regression model for examining the association between Internet use and outpatient clinic visits. Results: We included a sample of 293 participants who answered the questionnaire with no missing data in the multivariate linear regression model. We found that Internet use was significantly associated with more outpatient clinic visits (P=.04). The participants with chronic diseases tended to make more outpatient clinic visits (P<.01). Conclusions: The inconsistent quality of health-related information obtained from the Internet may be associated with patients' increasing need for interpreting and discussing the information with health care professionals, thus resulting in an increasing number of outpatient clinic visits.

Our results showed that these magnetofluorescent GdNS@CQDs have excellent fluorescent and magnetic properties. Moreover, GdNS@CQDs exhibited high stability at physiological conditions and ionic strength. These magnetofluorescent GdNS@CQDs were conjugated with a folic acid, denoted as FA-GdNS@CQDs, for targeting dual modal fluorescence/magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. The in vitro and in vivo studies confirmed the high biocompatibility and low toxicity of FA-GdNS@CQDs. FA-GdNS@CQDs enhanced the MR response as compared to that for commercial Gd-DTPA. The targeting capabilities of FA-GdNS@CQDs were confirmed in HeLa and HepG2 cells using in vitro fluorescence and MR dual modality imaging. Additionally, an anticancer drug, doxorubicin, was incorporated into the FA-GdNS@CQDs forming FA-GdNS@CQDs-DOX, which enables targeted drug delivery. Importantly, the prepared FA-GdNS@CQDs-DOX showed a high quantity of doxorubicin loading capacity (about 80%) and pH-sensitive drug release. The uptake into cancer cells and the intracellular location of the FA-GdNS@CQDs were observed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. We also successfully demonstrated in vivo fluorescence bio imaging of the FA-GdNS@CQDs, using zebrafish as an animal model.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a fully automatic landmark annotation (FALA) system for finding cephalometric landmarks in lateral cephalograms and its application to the classification of skeletal malformations. Digital cephalograms of 400 subjects (age range: 7-76 years) were available. All cephalograms had been manually traced by two experienced orthodontists with 19 cephalometric landmarks, and eight clinical parameters had been calculated for each subject. A FALA system to locate the 19 landmarks in lateral cephalograms was developed. The system was evaluated via comparison to the manual tracings, and the automatically located landmarks were used for classification of the clinical parameters. The system achieved an average point-to-point error of 1.2 mm, and 84.7% of landmarks were located within the clinically accepted precision range of 2.0 mm. The automatic landmark localisation performance was within the inter-observer variability between two clinical experts. The automatic classification achieved an average classification accuracy of 83.4% which was comparable to an experienced orthodontist. The FALA system rapidly and accurately locates and analyses cephalometric landmarks in lateral cephalograms, and has the potential to significantly improve the clinical work flow in orthodontic treatment. ?

A vertex denotes a supplier, a transfer center, or a customer and a branch connecting a pair of vertices denotes a carrier. In the brittle commodity logistics network, each supplier has limited production capacity and the production cost is counted in terms of the number of the provided goods. Moreover, the delivery capacity (e.g. number of containers) provided by any carrier is multistate because the partial capacities may be reserved for other customers, and the delivery cost is counted in terms of the consumed delivery capacity. In the brittle commodity delivery, the goods may be damaged by natural disasters, traffic accidents, collisions, and so on, such that the intact goods can not satisfy the customer demand. Hence the delivery damage should be considered while evaluating the performance of a logistics network. This paper proposes the supply-chain reliability, which is defined as the probability of the network to successfully deliver goods to the customer with the delivery damage, limited production capacity, and budget considerations, to be a performance index. In terms of minimal paths, an algorithm is developed to evaluate the supply-chain reliability. A practical case of flat glass logistics is employed to discuss the management implications of the supply-chain reliability. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Brittle commodity logistics network; Flat glass logistics; Multistate delivery capacity; Supply-chain reliability,,2-s2.0-84908305551

This condition may lead to exhaustion, osteoporosis, depression, inability of concentration, and other symptoms if people cannot be exposed to enough sunlight. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an Intelligent Natural Light Illumination System. This illumination system can take people's health and environmental protection into account. This system can divide into four parts: light collecting, light transmitting, light emitting, and auxiliary lighting. When the sunlight is enough, the lighting system can guide the sunlight into the building for lighting applications. The auxiliary lighting subsystem would control the LED to satisfy the users' demand when the brightness of the environment could not achieve the desired results. After that, it can let the sunlight indoors and improve the quality of human's life at the same time. ? 2016 IEEE.",Energy Saving; Green Energy; Natural Light,Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Light emission; Lighting; Smart power grids; Green energy; Human being; Illumination system; In-buildings; Lighting applications; Lighting systems; Natural light; Survival and growth; Light emitting diodes,2-s2.0-84986253546

The simulations of the 'docking', first as a rigid-body complex, and eventually through flexible-fit analysis, creates 36 different complexes from four initial orientations of the nanoparticle strategically positioned around the surface of the enzyme. The structural deviations of the enzymes from the initial x-ray crystal structure during each docking simulation are assessed by comparative analysis of secondary structural elements, root mean square deviations, B-factors, interactive bonding energies, dihedral angles, radius of gyration (R g), circular dichroism (CD), volume occupied by Cα, electrostatic potentials, solvation energies and hydrophobicities. Normalisation of the data narrows the selection from the initial 36 to one 'final' probable structure. It is concluded that, after computer simulations on each of the 36 initial complexes incorporating the 12 different biophysical techniques, the top five complexes are the same no matter which technique is explored. The significance of the present work is an expansion of an earlier study on the molecular dynamic simulation for the interaction of HIVPR with silver nanoparticles. This work is supported by experimental evidence since the initial 'orientation' of the AgNP with the enzyme is the same as the 'final' AuNP-HIVPR complex generated in the present study. The findings will provide insight into the forces of the binding of the HIVPR to AuNP.

Understanding how medical students are aware of medical knowledge and how they learn medicine is a critical issue of medical education. The main purposes of this study were to investigate medical students' epistemic beliefs relating to medical knowledge, and to examine their relationships with students' approaches to learning medicine. Methods: A total of 340 undergraduate medical students from 9 medical colleges in Taiwan were surveyed with the Medical-Specific Epistemic Beliefs (MSEB) questionnaire (i.e., multi-source, uncertainty, development, justification) and the Approach to Learning Medicine (ALM) questionnaire (i.e., surface motive, surface strategy, deep motive, and deep strategy). By employing the structural equation modeling technique, the confirmatory factor analysis and path analysis were conducted to validate the questionnaires and explore the structural relations between these two constructs. Results: It was indicated that medical students with multi-source beliefs who were suspicious of medical knowledge transmitted from authorities were less likely to possess a surface motive and deep strategies. Students with beliefs regarding uncertain medical knowledge tended to utilize flexible approaches, that is, they were inclined to possess a surface motive but adopt deep strategies. Students with beliefs relating to justifying medical knowledge were more likely to have mixed motives (both surface and deep motives) and mixed strategies (both surface and deep strategies). However, epistemic beliefs regarding development did not have significant relations with approaches to learning. Conclusions: Unexpectedly, it was found that medical students with sophisticated epistemic beliefs (e.g., suspecting knowledge from medical experts) did not necessarily engage in deep approaches to learning medicine. Instead of a deep approach, medical students with sophisticated epistemic beliefs in uncertain and justifying medical knowledge intended to employ a flexible approach and a mixed approach, respectively. ? 2016 The Author(s).",Approach to learning; Epistemic beliefs; Learning medicine; Medical students,"factorial analysis; human; learning; major clinical study; medical expert; medical school; medical student; medicine; path analysis; questionnaire; structural equation modeling; Taiwan; uncertainty; adolescent; adult; female; knowledge; male; medical education; medical student; motivation; psychology; statistical model; young adult; Adolescent; Adult; Education, Medical; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Female; Humans; Knowledge; Learning; Male; Models, Statistical; Motivation; Students, Medical; Surveys and Questionnaires; Taiwan; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84978910927

Teeth are defenseless to this infection all through their lifetime especially when care is not taken for proper oral hygiene. It is significant to analyze the dental images in order to improve and quantify medical images for correct diagnosis. Caries or cavity is one of the most prevalent diseases of the teeth. Dentists are putting the best effort to identify the problem at an earlier stage. The proposed method used in this paper is focused on the challenges faced during the cavity detection which sometimes is very tedious task due to small lesions not visible to human eye. The image processing techniques helps to identify the caries that provide dentists with the precise results of the area affected by the caries. The proposed methodology consists of preprocessing of bitewing radiographic images followed by edge recognition, thresholding and connected component labelling. This combinational approach provides qualitative and quantitative assessment to dentists on the presence of cavity. The caries are detected by connected component and mask overlap helps to highlight the affected area to grade the severity which is tested on the basis of line intensity profiles.

FDT (foot delay time) and amplitude proportions (Cn) and their standard deviations (SDn) and coefficients of variations (CVn) were calculated for harmonics 1 to 10 of the PPG waveform. FDT was smaller in MS than in Control. C1 and C2 values were significantly smaller, whereas C4-C9 values were significantly or appeared to be larger in MS than in pre-MS. Most of the SDn and CVn values were largest in MS. This study is the first to demonstrate that harmonic-analysis indexes of the beat-to-beat PPG waveform can provide information about MetS-induced changes in the arterial pulse transmission and cardiovascular regulatory activities.

When inflammation becomes unregulated, recurrent, or excessive, it interferes with burn wound healing. Autophagy, which is a homeostatic and catabolic degradation process, was found to protect against ischemic injury, inflammatory diseases, and apoptosis in some cases. In the present study, we investigated whether far-infrared (FIR) could ameliorate burn wound progression and promote wound healing both in vitro and in a rat model of deep second-degree burn. We found that FIR induced autophagy in differentiated THP-1 cells (human monocytic cells differentiated to macrophages). Furthermore, FIR inhibited both the NLRP3 inflammasome and the production of IL-1β in lipopolysaccharide-activated THP-1 macrophages. In addition, FIR induced the ubiquitination of ASC, which is the adaptor protein of the inflammasome, by increasing tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which is a ubiquitin E3 ligase. Furthermore, the exposure to FIR then promoted the delivery of inflammasome to autophagosomes for degradation. In a rat burn model, FIR ameliorated burn-induced epidermal thickening, inflammatory cell infiltration, and loss of distinct collagen fibers. Moreover, FIR enhanced autophagy and suppressed the activity of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the rat skin tissue of the burn model. Based on these results, we suggest that FIR-regulated autophagy and inflammasomes will be important for the discovery of novel therapeutics to promote the healing of burn wounds.

Au nanoparticles were decorated on the shell and PF6 was placed in the core of the nanoparticles. Highly stable Au nanoparticles were achieved using PF6 with poly(N-vinylcaprolactam-co-N-vinylimidazole)-g-poly(d,l-lactide) graft copolymer hybridization. This was compared with hybridization using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and polyethylene glycol-b-poly(d,l-lactide) for shell formation with PF6-Au. The resulting PF6-poly(N-vinylcaprolactam-co-N-vinylimidazole)-g-poly(d,l-lactide)-Au core-shell nanoparticle were utilized for photothermal and photodynamic activities. The spectroscopic analysis and zeta potential values of micelles revealed the presence of a thin Au layer coated on the PF6 nanoparticle surface, which generally enhanced the thermal stability of the gold nanoparticles and the photothermal effect of the shell. The core-shell PF6-Au nanoparticles were avidly taken up by cells and demonstrated cellular phototoxicity upon irradiation with 300 W halogen lamps. The structural arrangement of PF6 dyes in the core-shell particles assures the effectiveness of singlet oxygen production.

In this paper, a new adaptive fuzzy interpolation method is proposed for sparse fuzzy rule-based systems based on ranking values and similarity measures of polygonal fuzzy sets, which can solve contradictions occurred in fuzzy interpolative reasoning processes.

However, the goods may rot or be spoilt during delivery owing to natural disasters, inclement weather, traffic accidents, collisions, and so on, such that the intact goods may not meet market demand. This paper concentrates on a stochastic-flow distribution network (SFDN), in which a node denotes a supplier, a transfer station, or a market, while a route denotes a carrier providing the delivery service for a pair of nodes. The available capacity of the carrier is stochastic because the capacity may be partially reserved by other customers. The addressed problem is to evaluate the system reliability, the probability that the SFDN can satisfy the market demand with the spoilage rate under the budget constraint from multiple suppliers to the customer. An algorithm is developed in terms of minimal paths to evaluate the system reliability along with a numerical example to illustrate the solution procedure.

According to an assessment of experiment results on g-means, our proposed method outperforms other methods such as linear regression, decision tree, back propagation neural network, support vector machine, and learning vector quantization.

Under a high-frequency magnetic field, magnetic carriers (diameter: ca. 50 nm) incorporating the anti-cancer drug doxorubicin collapsed, releasing approximately 80% of the drug payload, due to the heat generated by the rapidly rotating Fe3O4 nanoparticles, thereby realizing rapid and accurate controlled drug release. Simultaneously, the magnetic Fe3O4 themselves could also kill the tumor cells through a hyperthermia effect (inductive heating).

To achieve active cancer targeting, QD and DOX-encapsulated NPs were conjugated with folate for folate-binding protein receptor-guided delivery, which overexpressed in many cancer cells. Hydrophobic DOX and hydrophilic MSA-capped QD were encapsulated in the bilayer and core of the PEG-PLGA nanopolymersomes, respectively. The data show that the formulated NPs sustained DOX release for a period of 12 days. Fluorescence microscopy and MTT assay demonstrated that the developed folate-targeted DOX-QD NPs had higher cytotoxicity than non-targeted NPs and the free form of the drug; moreover, they preferentially accumulated in 4T1 and MCF-7 cells in vitro. In vivo experiments including whole organ tissue-homogenate analysis and organ fluorescence microscopy imaging of BALB/c mice bearing 4T1 breast adenocarcinoma showed that the folate receptor-targeted QD encapsulated NPs accumulate at tumor sites 6 h following intravenous injection. Acute toxicity studies of the prepared targeted QD-loaded NPs showed no evidence of long-term harmful histopathological and physiological effects on the treated animals. The in vivo tumor inhibitory effect of folic acid (FA)-QD-DOX NPs demonstrated an augmented therapeutic efficacy of targeted formulation over the non-targeted and free drug.

In the initial step, the bright luminescent of QDs, with % QY up to 55.3, were synthesized with one-pot two-step process resulting narrow particle distribution and successfully transferred to water phase without significant effect on optical properties. The water-soluble AgInS2-ZnS quantum dots (QDs) encapsulated with oleylamine have been successfully prepared by ultrasonication assisting. Several aspect including QDs characterization, pH stability, ionic strength, and bonding properties were investigated to reach desired condition of water-soluble AgInS2-ZnS QDs. Folic acid was further conjugated to QDs for HeLa and MCF7 cancer cell imaging to performs the targeting capability. Moreover, folic acid is efficiently internalized into cell through the receptor-mediated endocytosis even when conjugated with a wide variety of molecules. Confocal imaging characterization further informs folic acid-conjugated AgInS2-ZnS QDs could most specific targeted to the human cervical (HeLa) cells. The therapeutic feature of QDs on HeLa cancer cell was conjugated by attributing methotrexate on the QDs, instead of folic acid, and the design could improve on inhibiting the cancer cell viability as well as its fluorescent intensity. ? 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.",,,2-s2.0-84984583435

In this study, a practical approach to living polymerization of functionalized thermoresponsive monomers enabled the incorporation of self-constituted multiple hydrogen bonded groups into micelles that have potential as supramolecular drug-delivery systems. Phase transitions and morphological studies in aqueous solution showed that the microstructure can be controlled to achieve well-defined vesicle-like micelles with respect to the strength of the hydrogen bond segment. Thus, the resulting micelles have a very low critical micellization concentration and very high loading capacity (16.1%), making the loading process extremely stable and efficient. Incorporation of the anticancer drug doxorubicin (DOX) affected the micellization process in aqueous solution and enabled fine-tuning of drug loading and precise control of drug release rate with excellent sensitivity. Release studies in vitro showed that DOX-loaded micelles exerted dose-dependent cytotoxicity against human liver carcinoma (HepG2) cells at the physiological temperature of 37 °C. In addition, DOX-loaded micelles were efficiently endocytosed by the cancer cells, which may enable the micelles to serve as suitable vehicles for effective delivery of anticancer drugs to primary tumors and metastatic disease. This newly developed material may provide a potential route towards next-generation drug delivery vehicles. Statement of Significance A breakthrough innovation in water-based thermo-responsive polymers has enabled significant progress in developing smart stimuli-responsive nanocarriers by generating novel ""supramolecular polymeric micelles"" via self-complementary hydrogen-bonding interactions. These newly developed micelles exhibit extremely high micellar stability and drug loading capacity (up to 16%), excellent thermo-responsive behavior and precise control of drug release rate due to hydrogen-bond-induced physical cross-linking. In addition, doxorubicin-loaded micelles were efficiently endocytosed by the cancer cells, which allows them to serve as suitable vehicles for effective delivery of anticancer drugs to primary tumors and metastatic disease. Thus, this work provides a potential route for the development of next generation multifunctional nanocarriers that have improved safety and to increase the therapeutic efficacy of anticancer therapy. ?2016 Acta Materialia Inc.

The current study aimed to identify the risk factors for tripping in these patients during trailing-limb obstacle-crossing. Fourteen patients with type II DM with or without mild peripheral neuropathy (PN) and 14 healthy controls walked and crossed obstacles of three different heights while their motion data were measured using a motion capture system and two forceplates. The DM group was found to cross obstacles with significantly reduced trailing toe clearance (p < 0.05), increasing the probability of the foot hitting the obstacle, and thus the risk of tripping. This altered end-point control was associated with significantly reduced knee flexion and hip adduction of the trailing swing limb (p < 0.05), as well as significantly increased ankle plantarflexor moments in the leading stance limb (p < 0.05). Therefore, reduced knee flexion and hip adduction of the swing limb are identified as risk factors for tripping during obstacle-crossing. Increased mechanical demands on the ankle plantarflexors suggest that weakness of these muscles may further reduce the already compromised performance of obstacle-crossing in these patients. The current results showed that obstacle-crossing can be used to detect gait deviations and to identify the associated risk of tripping in patients with type II DM without or at an early stage of PN. ? 2016 Elsevier B.V..","Diabetes mellitus; Gait; Joint kinetics; Obstacle crossing; Trailing limb, Joint kinematics","adduction; adult; Article; biomechanics; body height; body weight; clinical article; controlled study; female; gait; human; knee function; leg length; male; middle aged; motor function test; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; obstacle crossing; peripheral neuropathy; priority journal; risk factor; tibia tuberosity; ankle; biomechanics; complication; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; falling; foot; kinesiotherapy; knee; pathophysiology; physiology; prevention and control; procedures; walking; Accidental Falls; Ankle Joint; Biomechanical Phenomena; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Exercise Therapy; Female; Foot; Gait; Humans; Knee Joint; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors; Walking",2-s2.0-84960367032

The 'docking' of AgNP with HIVPR creates a complex [AgNP-HIVPR] to initiate a hypochromic time-dependent red-shift for the surface plasmon resonance maximum. MD simulations reflect large perturbations to enzyme conformations by fluctuations of both rmsd and B-factors. Increase in changes to electrostatic potentials within the enzyme, especially, with chain B, suggest hydrophobic interactions for the binding of the AgNP. This is supported by changes to mainchain and sidechain dihedrals for many hydrophobic amino acid including Cys95, Trp6 and Trp42. Circular dichroism spectra reveal disappearance of α-helices and β-sheets and increase in random coil first from chain B then chain A. During initial stages of the interactive simulation the enzyme is conformational flexible to accommodate the AgNP, that docks with the enzyme under a cooperative mechanism, until a more stable structure is formed at convergence. There is a decrease in size of the HIVPR-AgNP complex measured by changes to the gyration radius supporting evidence that the AgNP associates, initially, with chain B. ? 2015 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers.",Docking; HIV protease; Molecular dynamics simulation; Silver nanoparticles,Chains; Circular dichroism spectroscopy; Dichroism; Diseases; Docking; Enzymes; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrophobicity; Light scattering; Light transmission; Metal nanoparticles; Molecular dynamics; Nanoparticles; Surface plasmon resonance; Transmission electron microscopy; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Viruses; Circular dichroism spectra; Electrostatic potentials; HIV-protease; Hydrophobic amino acids; Hydrophobic interactions; Interactive simulations; Molecular dynamics simulations; Silver nanoparticles; Silver,2-s2.0-84958772390

Despite of its advantages, the high mobility of ECG leads to the increasing of motion artifacts and baseline drifts which then become another challenge to be overcome. A method based on Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) algorithm is proposed in this research for reducing noises and artifacts caused by motion, e.g. muscle movement, baseline drifts, and electrode motions. Testing was done by generating noisy signal using three types of noise recordings (taken from MIT-BIH Noise Stress database) and normal ECG recordings (taken from MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database with normal annotations), which each type of noisy signals divided into five noise levels i.e. 2, 6, 10, 14, and 18 dB. The performance of proposed method was then evaluated qualitatively by asking opinion from qualified general practitioners and quantitatively by calculating the SNR values. The output signals are then compared with output from Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). As the results, for three types of noise tested, the ECGs are qualitatively tolerable for being used for diagnosis if the SNR are equal or above 9 dB. According to that, proposed method is effective for reducing muscle noise and electrode motion artifacts with noise levels 6 dB and 10 dB in which the output SNR increased around 9 dB or more. For baseline drifts, this method performs very well for noisy signal with noise levels 2 dB, 6 dB, and 10 dB. ? 2015 IEEE.",baseline drifts; electrocardiogram (ECG); electrode motion; ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD); muscle noise,Algorithms; Biomedical engineering; Diagnosis; Diseases; Electrocardiography; Electrodes; FIR filters; Impulse response; Muscle; Signal processing; Signal to noise ratio; Artifact reduction; Baseline drift; Cardio-vascular disease; Electrode motion; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Ensemble empirical mode decompositions (EEMD); General practitioners; Muscle noise; Biomedical signal processing,2-s2.0-84963959980

However, compromising, which includes accommodating and sacrificing, may also lead to anxiety and depression. Therefore, the current study focused on a moderating mechanism between compromising and psychological health. Based on self-expansion theory, we hypothesized that the more individuals have a relational focus (i.e., a greater use of “we”) while narrating their compromising experiences, the better psychological health they will experience. Two hundred sixty-one participants from National Taiwan University (mean age?=?20.40, 53.26?% male, 46.74?% female), wrote about an experience of conflict with their parents and completed a package of questionnaires to measure their conflict management style and psychological health. The frequency of the “we” pronoun was considered an index of relational focus. As predicted, the results from a hierarchical multiple regression demonstrated that “we” moderated the effect of compromising style on well-being. Specifically, the relationship between compromising and psychological well-being were strengthened for individuals who had more relational focus. Thus, although a compromising style helps solve interpersonal conflicts, it does not necessarily increase individuals’ well-being. How individuals anchor their experiences are more important. ? 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Compromise; Conflict; Linguistic inquiry and word count (LIWC); Pronoun “we”; Self-expansion; Well-being,,2-s2.0-84957433915

Although nobiletin exhibits antitumor activity against various cancer cells, the effect of nobiletin on glioma cells remains unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the effects of nobiletin on the human U87 and Hs683 glioma cell lines. Treating glioma cells with nobiletin (20-100 μm) reduced cell viability and arrested the cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, as detected using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay and propidium iodide (PI) staining, respectively; however, nobiletin did not induce cell apoptosis according to PI-annexin V double staining. Data from western blotting showed that nobiletin significantly attenuated the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 2, cyclin-dependent kinase 4, and E2 promoter-binding factor 1 (E2F1) and the phosphorylation of Akt/protein kinase B and mitogen-activated protein kinases, including p38, extracellular signal-regulated kinase, and c-Jun N-terminal kinase. Our data also showed that nobiletin inhibited glioma cell migration, as detected by both functional wound healing and transwell migration assays. Altogether, the present results suggest that nobiletin inhibits mitogen-activated protein kinase and Akt/protein kinase B pathways and downregulates positive regulators of the cell cycle, leading to subsequent suppression of glioma cell proliferation and migration.

On the basis of these results, G4.5-IL6 is a better suited carrier for targeted drug delivery of DOX to cervical cancer cells. ? 2015 American Chemical Society.",,"Antibodies; Cytotoxicity; Dendrimers; Efficiency; Encapsulation; Molecular biology; Organic polymers; Peptides; Cellular internalization; Cervical cancer cells; Cytotoxic effects; Drug-release rate; Encapsulation efficiency; Polyamidoamine dendrimers; Receptor-mediated endocytosis; Targeted drug delivery; Cytology; antibody; arginyl-glycyl-aspartic acid; dendrimer; doxorubicin; interleukin 6; oligopeptide; polyamidoamine; polyamine; apoptosis; cell survival; chemistry; confocal microscopy; dose response; drug delivery system; drug effects; flow cytometry; HeLa cell line; human; immunology; kinetics; metabolism; pH; procedures; structure activity relation; Antibodies; Apoptosis; Cell Survival; Dendrimers; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Doxorubicin; Drug Delivery Systems; Flow Cytometry; HeLa Cells; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Interleukin-6; Kinetics; Microscopy, Confocal; Oligopeptides; Polyamines; Structure-Activity Relationship",2-s2.0-84955300737

To address this issue, the present study aims to investigate the issue of fatigue caused by joint-based pointing methods and Control-Display gains (CD gains) via Fitts' task. Ten healthy subjects participated in the experiment and performed multi-directional tapping tests with three joint-based pointing methods and three CD gains. The experimental results indicated that the joint-based pointing methods indeed affected the physiological and subjective fatigue of the upper limb muscles and measured body parts during distal pointing tasks. The wrist-based pointing method, which can induce substantially lower physiological and subjective fatigue, appears to be superior to the other two methods.

A robust association exists between depression and increased morbidity and mortality after ACS. This study examined the relationship between suicide and ACS after adjusting for depression and other comorbidities. Methods and Results--In this case-referent study conducted in Taiwan, the cases were people aged 35 years or older who died from suicide between 2000 and 2012 and 4 live referents, each matched by age, sex, and area of residence. The covariates adjusted for in the analysis were sociodemographic characteristics, physical comorbidities, and psychiatric disorders. We identified 41 050 persons who committed suicide and 164 200 referents. In the case and referent groups, 1027 (2.5%) and 2412 (1.5%) patients had ACS, respectively. After potential confounders were adjusted, ACS was significantly associated with increased odds of suicide (aOR=1.15, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.05-1.26). The odds of suicide were highest during the initial 6 months post-ACS diagnosis (OR=3.05, 95% CI=2.55-3.65) and remained high for at least 4 years after ACS diagnosis. Conclusions--ACS patients are at an increased risk of suicide compared with otherwise healthy people. The risk of suicide is particularly high in the 6 months after ACS diagnosis. Our results suggest that we need to identify efficacious methods to recognize those at risk for suicide and to develop effective interventions to prevent such deaths. ? 2016 The Authors.",Acute coronary syndrome; Acute myocardial infarction; Suicide,acute coronary syndrome; adult; age; age distribution; aged; area of residence; Article; case referent study; clinical study; comorbidity; confidence interval; controlled study; disease association; dyslipidemia; female; gender; hospitalization; human; hypertension; ICD-9-CM; major clinical study; male; medical parameters; middle aged; morbidity; mortality; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; acute coronary syndrome; case control study; demography; epidemiology; psychology; statistics and numerical data; suicide; Taiwan; Acute Coronary Syndrome; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Suicide; Taiwan,2-s2.0-85006483291

Mouse tissue samples were cut into sections and examined microscopically to determine the condition of cancer metastasis. Spectral analysis performed after 1 week revealed a significant decrease in the relative energy contribution of the endothelium-related frequency band, and significant increases in those of the myogenic and respiration-related frequency bands of the LDF signals in the metastasis group (n=12). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of evaluating metastasis in animal subjects based on changes in noninvasively measured LDF parameters. Changes in the LDF spectral indexes can be attributed to differences in the microcirculatory regulatory activities.

The aim of this study was to overcome this limitation by designing and constructing an in vitro CTC capture assay. We blended poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) into nylon-6 through electrospinning to generate a fibrous mat-based capture assay of CTCs. The contents of nylon-6, PSBMA, and PAA in the electrospun triple-blend fibrous mats (ETBFMs) were optimized to avoid degradation and to balance between the non-biofouling behavior and the antibody immobilizing efficiency. In addition, we examined the capture ability of CTCs for clinical diagnoses of colorectal cancer, in comparison with the results identified through pathological analyses of biopsies from colonoscopies. For nine individuals with stage II, III, and IV colorectal cancer, our CTC detection with ETBFMs provided complete positive expression. Two of four individuals were diagnosed to possess stage I colorectal cancer. Two of seven individuals without colorectal tumor, as identified through pathological analyses of biopsies, exhibited positive expression of CTCs. These positive results suggest that such ETBFMs are promising materials for in vitro CTC capture assays. ?

Patients with knee OA received a 6-week physiotherapist-supervised and home-based exercise program. Outcome measures, including the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index and Short Form-36 Health Survey as well as objective biomechanical indices were obtained at baseline and follow-up. After treatment, no significant difference was observed in the knee abductor moment (KAM), lever arm, and ground reaction force. We, however, observed significantly improved pain and physical function as well as altered gait patterns, including a higher hip flexor moment and hip extension angle with a faster walking speed. Although KAM was unchanged, patients with bilateral knee OA showed an improved walking speed and altered the gait pattern after 6 weeks of supervised exercise. This finding suggests that the exercise intervention improves proximal joint mechanics during walking and can be considered for patients with bilateral knee OA.

Specific peaks from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated successful modification of the carbon dots by boronic acid. The lower cytotoxic effects of this carbon-based material were evaluated using WST-1 assays. The existence of boronic acid moieties on the edge of carbon dots enhanced the inhibitory activity by suppressing syncytium formation.

Lung cancer patients with brain metastasis tend to have a poor survivability, which is less than 6 months in median. Therefore, an early and effective detection system for such disease is needed to help prolong the patients’ survivability and improved their quality of life. A modified electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM) algorithm, MEM-SVM, is proposed by combining EM algorithm with support vector machine (SVM) as the classifier and opposite sign test (OST) as the local search technique. The proposed method is applied to 44 UCI and IDA datasets, and 5 cancers microarray datasets as preliminary experiment. In addition, this method is tested on 4 lung cancer microarray public dataset. Further, we tested our method on a nationwide dataset of brain metastasis from lung cancer (BMLC) in Taiwan. Since the nature of real medical dataset to be highly imbalanced, the synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) is utilized to handle this problem. The proposed method is compared against another 8 popular benchmark classifiers and feature selection methods. The performance evaluation is based on the accuracy and Kappa index. For the 44 UCI and IDA datasets and 5 cancer microarray datasets, a nonparametric statistical test confirmed that MEM-SVM outperformed the other methods. For the 4 lung cancer public microarray datasets, MEM-SVM still achieved the highest mean value for accuracy and Kappa index. Due to the imbalanced property on the real case of BMLC dataset, all methods achieve good accuracy without significance difference among the methods. However, on the balanced BMLC dataset, MEMSVM appears to be the best method with higher accuracy and Kappa index. We successfully developed MEM-SVM to predict the occurrence of brain metastasis from lung cancer with the combination of SMOTE technique to handle the class imbalance properties. The results confirmed that MEM-SVM has good diagnosis power and can be applied as an alternative diagnosis tool in with other medical tests for the early detection of brain metastasis from lung cancer. ?

Methods: A total of 164 in-service pharmacists in Taiwan were surveyed with the Internet Self-Efficacy Survey, including basic ISE (B-ISE), advanced ISE (A-ISE) and professional ISE (P-ISE), as well as the Self-Regulated Learning Questionnaire consisting of preparatory SRL (P-SRL) and enactment SRL (E-SRL). Results: Results of a 1-by-3 (educational levels: junior college versus bachelor versus master) analysis of variance and a 1-by-4 (institutions: community-based versus hospital versus clinic versus company) analysis of variance revealed that there were differences in ISE and SRL among different education levels and working institutions. The hierarchical regression analyses indicated that B-ISE and P-ISE were significant predictors of P-SRL, whereas P-ISE was a critical predictor of E-SRL. Moreover, the interaction of P-ISE · age was linked to E-SRL, implying that P-ISE has a stronger influence on E-SRL for older pharmacists than for younger pharmacists. However, the interactions between age and ISE (A-ISE, B-ISE, and P-ISE) were not related to P-SRL.

The site of cancer and duration between the diagnosis of dementia and cancer were analyzed. Among the dementia cases, 169 patients (5.2%) were diagnosed with cancer during a median observation period of 40 months. In the control group, 976 subjects (7.4%) were diagnosed with cancer, during a median observation period of 46 months. During a 7-year follow-up period, the adjusted hazard ratio for cancer among dementia patients was 0.77 (95% confidence interval, 0.65-0.91), and significantly lower for colon (0.54, 0.29-0.99) and prostate cancers (0.44, 0.20-0.98). This study showed an inverse association between cancer and dementia. Further studies focusing on colon and prostate cancers may help elucidate the underlying mechanism and expand the therapeutic strategies. Copyright ? 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Intercellular transport is related to many diseases and nanotubes are potentially useful as drug-delivery channels for cancer therapy. Here, we apply fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) as a photostable tracker, as well as a protein carrier, to illustrate the transport events in TNTs of human cells. Proteins, including bovine serum albumin and green fluorescent protein, are first coated on 100-nm FNDs by physical adsorption and then single-particle tracking of the bioconjugates in the transient membrane connections is carried out by fluorescence microscopy. Stop-and-go and to-and-fro motions mediated by molecular motors are found for the active transport of protein-loaded FNDs trapped in the endosomal vehicles of human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T). Quantitative analysis of the heterotypical transport between HEK293T and SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells by flow cytometry confirm the formation of open-ended nanotubes between them, despite that their TNTs differ in structural components. Our results demonstrate the promising applications of this novel carbon-based nanomaterial for intercellular delivery of biomolecular cargo down to the single-particle level. Tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) provide a unique intercellular communication pathway through which transport of proteins, vesicles, and organelles occurs. Using fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) as a photostable and biocompatible marker, this work successfully tracks protein-loaded FNDs along the TNTs of human cells and demonstrates its potential use for the intercellular delivery of biomolecular cargo at the single-particle level. ? 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Methods The records of patients with newly diagnosed NPC who had received concomitant chemotherapy and RT in a tertiary referral center from 1997 January to 2012 July were retrospectively reviewed. Results RT-related external auditory canal cholesteatoma (RT-related EACC) was identified in 15 of 833 patients given RT for NPC. Three patients had EACC in both ears. The interval from completion of RT to the diagnosis of EACC ranged from 0.5 to 15.4 years (mean, 5.6 years). RT-related EACC commonly (75%) invaded the anterior and inferior parts of the external canal wall. Canaloplasty was used in 12 patients to surgically remove cholesteatoma. There was no recurrence of RT-related EACC during the study period. Conclusion Patients with NPC might contract RT-related EACC a few years after RT.

Many clinical studies have demonstrated that adjacent segment degeneration was observed in patients over time. Various instrumentations of pedicle screw-based stabilization systems have been investigated using numerical approaches. However, numerical models developed in the past were simplified to reduce computational time. The aim of this study was to evaluate and to compare the biomechanical performance of rigid, semi-rigid, and dynamic posterior instrumentations using a more realistic numerical model. Three-dimensional nonlinear finite element models of the T11-S1 multilevel spine with various posterior instrumentations were developed. The intersegmental rotation, the maximum disc stress, and the maximum implant stress were calculated. The results indicated that the rigid instrumentation resulted in greater fixation stability but also a greater risk of adjacent segment degeneration and implant failure. The biomechanical performance of the dynamic instrumentation was closer to that of the intact spine model compared with the rigid and semi-rigid instrumentations. The results of this study could help surgeons understand the biomechanical characteristics of different posterior instrumentations for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc diseases. ? 2015 National Taiwan University.",Adjacent segment degeneration; Dynamic instrumentation; Finite element analyses; Rigid instrumentation,Biomechanics; Diseases; Joint prostheses; Numerical models; Orthotics; Screws; Stabilization; Adjacent segment degeneration; Biomechanical characteristics; Biomechanical performance; Degenerative disc disease; Dynamic instrumentation; Posterior stabilizations; Rigid instrumentation; Three-dimensional nonlinear finite element model; Finite element method; polycarbonate; polyetheretherketone; polyethylene terephthalate; stainless steel; titanium; urethan; Article; biomechanics; bone stress; comparative effectiveness; cortical bone; device failure; dynamic pedicle screw posterior stabilization system; dynamic stabilization device; finite element analysis; human; intervertebral disk degeneration; joint stability; ligamentum flavum; lumbar degenerative disc disease; male; nucleus pulposus; pedicle screw fixation device; posterior longitudinal ligament; posterior spine fusion; range of motion; rigid pedicle screw posterior stabilization system; risk assessment; semi rigid pedicle screw posterior stabilization system; tension; trabecular bone; Young modulus,2-s2.0-84983095466

However, because of susceptibility-related signal loss, parahippocampal activation in the DMN is difficult to detect in resting-state functional MRI experiments that are conducted using a 3.0-T MRI scanner. This study investigated the magnetic field gradients of various brain regions and attempted to compensate for signal loss in the PHC using an optimized slice orientation. The field gradients, signal intensities and DMN functional connectivity (FC) of the PHC were investigated using datasets acquired from 18 healthy volunteers. The results show that the field gradient component parallel to the main magnetic field dominates the PHC. The results indicate that the signal intensities and FC of the DMN are significantly low in the PHC when the slice orientation of the imaging plane is transversal. Whether the voxel dimension is isotropic or anisotropic exerts a minimal effect in altering the slice orientation dependence. In conclusion, the results of this study support the selection of the coronal or sagittal planes for imaging of the DMN. ? 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Default-mode network (DMN); Parahippocampal gyrus (PHC),"Brain; Magnetic fields; Scanning; Default mode network (DMN); Default-mode networks; Functional connectivity; Magnetic field gradient; Main magnetic fields; Orientation dependence; Parahippocampal gyrus (PHC); Resting state functional mris; Magnetic resonance imaging; adult; anisotropy; Article; brain region; default mode network; female; functional magnetic resonance imaging; human; human experiment; image analysis; image processing; magnetic field; male; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; parahippocampal gyrus; priority journal; susceptibility weighted imaging; young adult; algorithm; brain mapping; image enhancement; nerve cell network; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parahippocampal gyrus; physiology; procedures; reproducibility; rest; sensitivity and specificity; signal noise ratio; three dimensional imaging; Adult; Algorithms; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Enhancement; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Nerve Net; Parahippocampal Gyrus; Reproducibility of Results; Rest; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal-To-Noise Ratio",2-s2.0-84954372572

Therefore, this study aimed to develop a customized nasal mask cushion to reduce the discomfort associated with conventional masks. First, a 3D face scanner was used to obtain 3D facial data of participants. Second, a model of the face was created by reverse-engineering and then used for the computer-aided design (CAD) of the cushion. Finally, computer numerical control (CNC) was used to manufacture the mold, into which silicone was then injected slowly. A perceived comfort questionnaire was used to compare the customized and conventional cushions. 40 patients were randomly divided into two groups: 20 patients in the control group used a conventional cushion, and the remaining 20 patients used the customized cushion. The customized cushion was found to be superior to the conventional cushion. There are clear differences in the headgear force of the two cushion types (P?=?0.001). The customized cushion applied less force to a patient’s face than a conventional cushion. Furthermore, there were obvious differences in the fit of the cushions (P?=?0.001).

The small hybrid carriers possessed a 1.3 times lower loading capacity (1.43. g/g(GO)) for doxorubicin (DOX) than the large hybrid carriers. However, the amount (86%) of DOX released at pH 5.5 from the small hybrids after 72. h was 1.14 times larger than from the large hybrids. This difference could be due to the extent of π-π interaction between DOX and the graphitic domain on GO. In vitro MTT assays revealed that the small hybrids led to higher cell viability than 63% at 0.75. μg/ml in HeLa human cervical cancer cells. An investigation of the intracellular uptake of hybrid carriers revealed the efficient internalization of small hybrids in the HeLa cells (97% at 62.5. mg/ml).

Four hybrid strategies of two-level C-ADRandACDF were compared in terms of adjacent segment degeneration (ASD) and implant failure. The rotary C-ADR and semirigid ACDF have been extensively used in the multilevel treatment of cervical instability and degeneration, but the constrained mobility at the ACDF segments can induce postoperative ASD problems. Hybrid surgery of C-ADR and ACDF has been an alternative to provide the optimal tradeoff between surgical cost and ASD problems. The biomechanical effects of hybrid strategies warrant thorough investigation for the two-level instrumentation. Based on computed tomography imaging, a nonlinear C2-C7 model was developed and validated by cadaveric and numerical data. Four strategies of inserting the C-ADR and ACDF into the C4-C6 segments were systematically arranged as PP (2 peek cages), AA(2 artificial discs), PA, and AP. The biomechanical behavior of these 4 strategies was evaluated in terms of motion and stresses of discs, facet forces, stresses of C-ADR and ACDF, and C-ADR motion. The constrained mobility of the ACDF segment worsened the kinematic and mechanical demands of the adjacent segments and artificial discs. The C-ADR articulation provided higher mobility than the replaced disc of the intact construct, making it an effective buffer to accommodate the compensated mobility and load from the ACDF segment. Consequently, the ASD progression of the AA construct was most restricted, followed by the PA, AP, and PP construct. The PA strategy is a tradeoff to preserve mobility and reduce cost. The C-ADR of the PA construct preserves the mobility of the C5/C6 segment and shares the transferred motion and loads of the fused C4/C5 segment. The PA construct shows optimal biomechanical results for minimizing ASD and implant failure, whereas the AP strategy is only recommended when cranial degeneration is the major concern.

Liver cancer is so common that it has been ranked first among cancer mortality rates since the early 1980s in Taiwan. Besides, liver cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases are the sixth or seventh in the causes of death.

The estimated total number of hepatitis B carriers in the general population aged more than 20 years old is 3,067,307. Thus, a case record review was conducted from all patients with diagnosis of acute hepatitis admitted to the Emergency Department (ED) of a well-known teaching-oriented hospital in Taipei. The cost of medical resource utilization is defined as the total medical fee. In this study, a fuzzy neural network is employed to develop the cost forecasting model. A total of 110 patients met the inclusion criteria.

When PSs in cells are exposed to specific wavelengths of light, they are transformed from the singlet ground state (S0) to an excited singlet state (S1-Sn), followed by intersystem crossing to an excited triplet state (T1). The energy transferred from T1 to biological substrates and molecular oxygen, via type I and II reactions, generates reactive oxygen species, (1O2, H2O2, O2*, HO*), which causes cellular damage that leads to tumor cell death through necrosis or apoptosis. The solubility, selectivity, and targeting of photosensitizers are important factors that must be considered in PDT. Nano-formulating PSs with organic and inorganic nanoparticles poses as potential strategy to satisfy the requirements of an ideal PDT system.

Recent research has suggested that these nanorods feature surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) signals superior to those of nanoparticles. In this study, nanorod geometrical models based on core-shell-isolated nanocapsule morphology were employed to analyze the scattered power density in three-dimensional spaces. Superior to the conventional cross-section field analysis method, the average scattered power density based method in this presentation could verify the enhancement effects from all possible positions on the nanorod surface. The numerical results in this study were also compared with the experimental results described in the literature. The resonance scattering power reached the maximal value when the radius of the Au/SiO<inf>2</inf> and Ag/SiO<inf>2</inf> nanorods was 20 nm. At an incident wavelength of 751 nm, the Au/SiO<inf>2</inf> and Au/Al2 O<inf>3</inf> nanorods achieved maximal scattered power density when spacing d=30 nm. Conversely, the Au/TiO<inf>2</inf> nanorods achieved maximum scattered power density when spacing d=40 nm. When the core was Au, nanorods with shell thickness h of 1 nm produced a resonant scattering intensity same as it by the nanorods without shells. The numerical results also indicated a stronger resonance peak when the incident ray illuminated the major-axis plane of the Au/SiO<inf>2</inf> nanorods. When the incident ray illuminated the curvature plane of the nanorods, the resonance wavelength clearly shifted toward the UV wavelength range. The four Au/SiO<inf>2</inf> nanorods with symmetric arrangement achieved the highest resonance peak when the nanorod spacing was 30 nm. This presentation can serve as a key reference for the design of core-shell-isolated nanorods as highly sensitive SERS substrates. ? 2002-2011 IEEE.",Finite difference time domain (FDTD); nanorod; shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman (SHINER); surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS); total-field-scattered-field (TFSF),"Finite difference time domain method; Gold; Nanoparticles; Nanorods; Raman scattering; Resonance; Shells (structures); Substrates; Time domain analysis; Field analysis method; Finite -difference time domains (FDTD); Resonance wavelengths; Scattered field; shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced Raman (SHINER); Surface enhanced Raman Scattering (SERS); Three dimensional space; UV wavelength ranges; Shell-isolated nanoparticle enhanced raman (SHINER); Surface scattering; gold; nanotube; silicon dioxide; silver; chemistry; computer simulation; procedures; Raman spectrometry; surface property; Computer Simulation; Gold; Nanotubes; Silicon Dioxide; Silver; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Surface Properties",2-s2.0-84940991744

Prior research has focused on examining the effects of VR on various outcomes, for example, learning and health. However, which factors affect the final outcomes? That is, what kind of VR system design will achieve higher usability? This question remains largely. Furthermore, when we look at VR system deployment from a human-computer interaction (HCI) lens, does user's attitude play a role in achieving the final outcome? This study aims to understand the effect of immersion and involvement, as well as users' regulatory focus on usability for a somatosensory VR learning system. This study hypothesized that regulatory focus and presence can effectively enhance user's perceived usability. Survey data from 78 students in Taiwan indicated that promotion focus is positively related to user's perceived efficiency, whereas involvement and promotion focus are positively related to user's perceived effectiveness. Promotion focus also predicts user satisfaction and overall usability perception. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd and The Ergonomics Society.",Presence; Promotion focus; Virtual reality,Usability engineering; Virtual reality; Human computer interaction (HCI); Perceived usability; Presence; Regulatory focus; Somatosensory; Technological advances; User satisfaction; User's attitudes; Human computer interaction; adult; Article; controlled study; female; health promotion; human; human computer interaction; human experiment; learning; male; normal human; perception; questionnaire; simulation; somatosensory stimulation; structural equation modeling; student satisfaction; university student; validity; virtual reality; young adult; adolescent; computer interface; consumer attitude; psychology; standards; video game; vision; Adolescent; Adult; Consumer Behavior; Female; Humans; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; Visual Perception; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84928879785

The management of small lung nodules noted on computed tomography scan is controversial due to uncertain tumor characteristics. A conventional computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) scheme requires several image processing and pattern recognition steps to accomplish a quantitative tumor differentiation result. In such an ad hoc image analysis pipeline, every step depends heavily on the performance of the previous step. Accordingly, tuning of classification performance in a conventional CAD scheme is very complicated and arduous. Deep learning techniques, on the other hand, have the intrinsic advantage of an automatic exploitation feature and tuning of performance in a seamless fashion. In this study, we attempted to simplify the image analysis pipeline of conventional CAD with deep learning techniques. Specifically, we introduced models of a deep belief network and a convolutional neural network in the context of nodule classification in computed tomography images. Two baseline methods with feature computing steps were implemented for comparison. The experimental results suggest that deep learning methods could achieve better discriminative results and hold promise in the CAD application domain. ? 2015 Hua et al.",Convolutional neural network; Deep belief network; Deep learning; Nodule classification,Article; artificial neural network; computer assisted diagnosis; computer assisted tomography; convolutional neural network; deep belief network; deep learning; disease classification; human; image analysis; image processing; lung nodule; machine learning; pattern recognition; sensitivity and specificity,2-s2.0-84939781083

Difficulty in detecting errors by human operators in numerical data entry necessitates an early error detection/prediction mechanism to proactively prevent severe accidents. To explore the possibility of using multi-channel electroencephalography (EEG) collected before movements/reactions to detect/predict human errors, linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier was utilised to predict numerical typing errors before their occurrence in numerical typing. Single trial EEG data were collected from seven participants during numerical hear-and-type tasks and three temporal features were extracted from six EEG sites in a 150-ms time window. The sensitivity of LDA classifier was revealed by adjusting the critical ratio of two Mahalanobis distances as a classification criterion. On average, the LDA classifier was able to detect 74.34% of numerical typing errors in advance with only 34.46% false alarms, resulting in a sensitivity of 1.05. A cost analysis also showed that using the LDA classifier would be beneficial as long as the penalty is at least 15 times the cost of inspection when the error rate is 5%. LDA demonstrated its realistic potential in detecting/predicting relatively few errors in numerical data without heavy pre-processing. This is one step towards predicting and preventing human errors in perceptual-motor tasks before their occurrence. ? 2014 Taylor & Francis.",electroencephalography; human errors; linear discriminant analysis,Biomedical signal processing; Cost benefit analysis; Discriminant analysis; Electroencephalography; Electrophysiology; Error detection; Forecasting; Classification criterion; Human errors; Linear discriminant analysis; Mahalanobis distances; Numerical typing; Realistic potentials; Single-trial EEG; Temporal features; Errors,2-s2.0-85028213874

Study design: Pre training-post-training. Analyses were limited to those randomized to the exercise intervention. Methods: The participants were chronically ill patients over 45 years old (47-89 years), of whom 25 completed the 12-week training regimen and assessment in the exercise group, whereas 29 completed the assessment in the control group, suffering from cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, or osteoporosis. The average age of the participants was 67.56 ± 10.70 years in the intervention group. All patients in this study signed institutional review board (IRB) agreements before participating (IRB approval no: FEMH-IRB-101029-E, v. 02, date: 20120429). Results: The results revealed the beneficial effects of regular aerobic and resistance training, which improved in elderly, chronically ill patients. According to our data, most of the gait function measurements exhibited significant differences between the exercise group and control group. The duration of the 'timed up-and-go' test decreased from 7.67 s to 6.76 s (P = 0.00013), and the 'the base of support area' increased from 392.0 cm2 to 433.2 cm2 (P = 0.0088). Women attained more significant differences than men in the exercise and control groups (P = 0.0008), and the participants aged 45-65 years had a more satisfactory outcome than those aged &gt; 65 years (P = 0.0109). Conclusion: Regular exercise regimens, such as aerobic, resistance or combination exercise training, enhance the gait function and sense of postural stability in elderly, chronically ill patients. Younger patients attained more positive results than older patients, and women attained more positive results than men. Regular exercise is a means of preventing falls; thus, the government and hospitals should increase promotional measures in aging communities to encourage regular exercise among elderly, chronically ill outpatients. ? 2015 The Royal Society for Public Health.",Aerobic exercise; Chronically ill patients; Elderly; Gait function; Resistance training,"disease; elderly population; health care; physical activity; training; accident prevention; adult; aerobic exercise; age; aged; Article; body equilibrium; cardiovascular disease; center of pressure; chronic patient; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; entropy; falling; female; gait; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; multivariate entropy; multivariate multiscale entropy; musculoskeletal system parameters; osteoporosis; outcome assessment; resistance training; sex difference; Taiwanese; therapy effect; treatment duration; body equilibrium; chronic disease; exercise; gait; kinesiotherapy; physiology; prevention and control; procedures; randomized controlled trial; Taiwan; treatment outcome; very elderly; Taiwan; Accidental Falls; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Chronic Disease; Exercise; Exercise Therapy; Female; Gait; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Postural Balance; Resistance Training; Taiwan; Treatment Outcome",2-s2.0-84941599678

MRI experiments showed that the magnetofluorescent NPs were effective contrast enhancement agents in T2-weighted MRI. Moreover, the NPs were also found to be effective fluorescent markers in an in vivo experiment in zebrafish embryos.

Eleven children (mean age 8.09 years) and ten adults participated in the study. Each participant played two digital games, Slap Stream and Kung Foo, from EyeToy Play software. Eye movements were recorded using Mobile Eye eyetracker. Eye-hand coordination strategies and the time when virtual object appeared, the gaze shifted to the object, the reach started, the gaze shifted away, and the reach ended were coded from the video. The latencies between these events were computed and compared between adults and children and between games. The fixation duration, number of fixations, and number of gaze points were also computed for each game's areas of interests. Results showed that (1) all participants used multiple eye-hand strategies while playing active video games with some strategies more than others; (2) the Kung Foo game (with one target appearing on the screen) and the Slap Stream game (with potentially multiple targets appearing on the screen) induced different latencies and gaze points between children and adults; and (3) children had longer latencies and shorter fixation durations than adults. The study thus provides in-depth understanding of different patterns of eye-hand coordination in relations to active video game playing. The significant differences in coordinative control strategies found between adults and children as well as between game types provide a basis for further research in both child development and game-based learning fields. ? 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Older adults with bilateral medial knee OA (age 66 ± 5.3 years; height 156 ± 4.9 cm; mass 60 ± 5.1 kg; leg length 83.72 ± 3.64 cm) were studied using computerized gait analysis initially (Baseline) and 6 weeks after using LW insoles (Follow-up) during barefoot walking and walking with LW insoles (7° of lateral inclination, with medial arch support). The three-dimensional angles and internal moments at the lower limb joints, as well as the ground reaction forces, were obtained using a motion analysis system and two forceplates. Key features of all the variables were compared using paired t tests for immediate effects (barefoot vs. LW) and for long-term effects (Baseline vs. Follow-up). The symptomatic severity (WOMAC Index) was also evaluated (Baseline vs. Follow-up). Results: The KAM with LW insoles at Baseline was significantly reduced when compared to the barefoot condition (p < 0.05), suggesting that the LW insoles were effective in reducing unfavorable loadings at the knee immediately upon wearing the insoles. After 6 weeks of wearing LW insoles (Follow-up), no significant changes were found in most of the biomechanical variables, including KAM (p > 0.05), when compared to Baseline with LW insoles. However, a specific gait adaptation with reduced knee loading was revealed when walking without LW insoles, i.e., for the barefoot condition (p < 0.05). Conclusions: After long-term use of LW insoles, the pain and physical function were improved with decreased peak KAM. A specific gait adaptation with reduced KAM was also found when walking without LW insoles. These results indicate a positive long-term effect in persons with bilateral medial knee OA, both as an orthosis to assist walking, and as a treatment intervention to facilitate gait adaptations in favor of reduced KAM. ? 2015 Hsu et al.",Gait adaptation; Joint kinematics; Joint kinetics; Knee; Laterally-wedged insoles; Osteoarthritis,"Biophysics; Gait analysis; Physiological models; Walking aids; Gait adaptation; Joint kinematics; Joint kinetics; Knee; Laterally-wedged insoles; Osteoarthritis; Joints (anatomy); aged; Article; body height; body mass; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; controlled study; disease severity; female; follow up; human; knee function; knee osteoarthritis; knee pain; laterally wedged insole; long term care; motion analysis system; orthopedic equipment; outcome assessment; priority journal; short course therapy; walking; biomechanics; foot orthosis; gait; knee; knee osteoarthritis; pathophysiology; physiology; spatiotemporal analysis; time factor; walking; weight bearing; Aged; Biomechanical Phenomena; Female; Foot Orthoses; Gait; Humans; Knee Joint; Osteoarthritis, Knee; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Time Factors; Walking; Weight-Bearing",2-s2.0-84929105213

However, during that time, mumps cases continued to occur. The purpose of the present study was to assess the epidemiology and vaccination policy for mumps in Taiwan. Methods: We examined the data on mumps cases collected by the Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CDC) between 2006 and 2011. Results: During the 6-year study period, a total of 6612 cases of mumps were reported to the Taiwan CDC. Of the patients with known vaccination status, 62% received one dose of the MMR vaccine or no vaccine. The incidence of mumps ranged from 4.18 to 5.28 per 100 000 population and peaked in 2007. Males had a higher incidence of mumps than females (5.9 vs. 3.7 per 100 000 population; P=0.024). Children between 5 and 6 years of age had the highest incidence of mumps, and those 20 years and older had the lowest incidence. Compared to those who received two doses of the MMR vaccine, patients who were not vaccinated or received a single dose of the vaccine had a higher risk of suffering from complications and/or hospitalization. Conclusions: In Taiwan, more than 60% of mumps cases received either no dose or one dose of the MMR vaccine. Monitoring mumps through biological testing and instituting a second dose of the MMR vaccine for children is needed for the elimination of mumps in Taiwan. ? 2014, Children's Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",epidemiology; incidence; measles-mumps-rubella vaccine; mumps,"measles mumps rubella vaccine; adolescent; adult; aged; child; female; health care policy; health survey; human; incidence; infant; male; middle aged; mumps; preschool child; Taiwan; very elderly; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Health Policy; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Measles-Mumps-Rubella Vaccine; Middle Aged; Mumps; Population Surveillance; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84939939311

Hinokitiol, a tropolone derivative found in Chamacyparis taiwanensis, has been found to exhibit anticancer activity in a variety of cancers through inhibition of cell proliferation. In the present study, the possible anti-proliferative effect of hinokitiol was investigated on VSMCs. Our results showed that hinokitiol significantly attenuated the PDGF-BB-stimulated proliferation of VSMCs without cytotoxicity. Hinokitiol suppressed the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), a maker for cell cycle arrest, and caused G0/G1 phase arrest in cell cycle progression. To investigate the mechanism underlying the anti-proliferative effect of hinokitiol, we examined the effects of hinokitiol on phosphorylations of Akt, ERK1/2, p38 and JNK1/2. Phospholipase C (PLC)-γ1 phosphorylation, its phosphorylated substrates and p27kip1 expression was also analyzed. Pre-treatment of VSMCs with hinikitiol was found to significantly inhibit the PDGF-BB-induced phosphorylations of JNK1/2 and PLC-γ1, however no effects on Akt, ERK1/2, and p38. The up-regulation of p27kip1 was also observed in hinokitiol-treated VSMCs. Taken together, our results suggest that hinokitiol inhibits PDGF-BB-induced proliferation of VSMCs by inducing cell cycle arrest, suppressing JNK1/2 phosphorylation and PLC-γ1, and stimulating p27kip1 expression. These findings suggest that hinokitiol may be beneficial for the treatment of vascular-related disorders and diseases. ? 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI.",G0/G1; Hinokitiol; JNK1/2; PCNA; PLC-γ1; VSMC,"beta-thujaplicin; cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; cycline; mitogen activated protein kinase p38; phospholipase C gamma; platelet derived growth factor B; platelet-derived growth factor BB; protein kinase B; terpene; tropolone; analogs and derivatives; animal; cell cycle checkpoint; cell cycle G0 phase; cell cycle G1 phase; cell proliferation; drug effects; male; metabolism; phosphorylation; rat; signal transduction; smooth muscle fiber; vascular smooth muscle; Wistar rat; Animals; Cell Cycle Checkpoints; Cell Proliferation; Cyclin-Dependent Kinase Inhibitor p27; G0 Phase; G1 Phase; Male; MAP Kinase Signaling System; Monoterpenes; Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; Myocytes, Smooth Muscle; p38 Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; Phospholipase C gamma; Phosphorylation; Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-akt; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-sis; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Signal Transduction; Tropolone",2-s2.0-84929223379

In this study, we proposed a probabilistic model using Bayesian network (BN) to predict the short survivability of patients with brain metastasis from lung cancer. A nationwide cancer patient database from 1996 to 2010 in Taiwan was used. The cohort consisted of 438 patients with brain metastasis from lung cancer. We utilized synthetic minority over-sampling technique (SMOTE) to solve the imbalanced property embedded in the problem. The proposed BN was compared with three competitive models, namely, naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM). Statistical analysis showed that performances of BN, LR, NB, and SVM were statistically the same in terms of all indices with low sensitivity when these models were applied on an imbalanced data set. Results also showed that SMOTE can improve the performance of the four models in terms of sensitivity, while keeping high accuracy and specificity. Further, the proposed BN is more effective as compared with NB, LR, and SVM from two perspectives: the transparency and ability to show the relation of factors affecting brain metastasis from lung cancer; it allows decision makers to find the probability despite incomplete evidence and information; and the sensitivity of the proposed BN is the highest among all standard machine learning methods. ? 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.",Bayesian network; Brain metastasis; Lung cancer; Survivability,"Artificial intelligence; Bayesian networks; Biological organs; Decision making; Learning systems; Pathology; Support vector machines; Brain metastasis; Competitive models; Imbalanced Data-sets; Logistic regressions; Lung Cancer; Probabilistic modeling; Survivability; Synthetic minority over-sampling techniques; Diseases; adult; aged; Article; Bayesian learning; brain metastasis; cancer patient; cancer prognosis; cancer survival; female; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; mathematical model; middle aged; statistical analysis; support vector machine; survival prediction; survival rate; survival time; Taiwan; Bayes theorem; biological model; brain tumor; epidemiology; factual database; lung tumor; mortality; prognosis; secondary; statistical model; statistics and numerical data; survival analysis; Aged; Bayes Theorem; Brain Neoplasms; Databases, Factual; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Biological; Models, Statistical; Prognosis; Support Vector Machine; Survival Analysis; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84927176256

Materials and Methods: This study enrolled 6 healthy subjects and 7 patients receiving radiotherapy. All participants received dynamic EPDWI with a total of 8 repetitions. Imaging quality of DWI was evaluated. Probability of severe overestimation of ADC (soADC), defined by an ADC ratio more than 1.2, was calculated. Error on T2WI, DWI, and ADC was computed. Statistical analysis included paired Student t testing and Mann-Whitney U test. A P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Transient signal loss was visually detected on some excitations of DWI but not on T2WI or mean DWI. soADC occurred randomly among 8 excitations and 3 directions of diffusion encoding gradients. Probability of soADC was significantly higher in radiotherapy group (42.86%) than in healthy group (24.39%). The mean error percentage decreased as the number of excitations increased on all images, and, it was smallest on T2WI, followed by DWI and ADC in an increasing order. Conclusions: Transient signal loss on DWI was successfully detected by dynamic EPDWI. The signal loss on DWI and overestimation of ADC could be partially remedied by increasing the number of excitations. ? 2015 Liu et al.",,"adult; apparent diffusion coefficient; Article; clinical article; controlled study; diffusion coefficient; diffusion weighted imaging; echo planar imaging; echoplanar diffusion weighted image; female; human; image quality; male; nuclear magnetic resonance scanner; parotid gland; radiotherapy; case control study; diagnostic imaging; echo planar imaging; Head and Neck Neoplasms; image processing; middle aged; parotid gland; pathology; radiography; risk; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Echo-Planar Imaging; Female; Head and Neck Neoplasms; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Male; Middle Aged; Parotid Gland; Radiography; Risk",2-s2.0-84928753681

Microtubules play a vital role in mitosis and in supporting the integrity of the cell due to their ability to withstand high compressive loads. Accordingly, microtubule-targeting agents (MTAs) have become one of the most promising classes of drugs in cancer therapy. This study evaluated changes in visco-elastic parameters induced by an appropriate concentration of an antimitotic drug in two different grades of colon cancer cells. Actin microfilaments and microtubules contents in the cells were evaluated by Western blot analysis and fluorescence intensity calculation. Micropipette aspiration experiments showed that the MTA had distinct mechanical effects on different cell lines. The more aggressive the cells, the greater the reduction in elasticity and viscosity. Invasive cells had a higher initial instantaneous Young's modulus than primary cells, but this reduced to approximately one half of the values for primary cells after 48. h of drug treatment. A considerable association was seen between the changes in mechanical properties and the microtubule to F-actin microfilament content ratio, which decreased with MTA treatment. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Cancer cell visco-elastic parameters; Colon cancer progression; Micropipette aspiration; Microtubule-targeting agent,Biomechanics; Cell culture; Diseases; Drug therapy; Elastic moduli; Elasticity; Electrophoresis; Oncogenic viruses; Proteins; Colon cancer; Cytoskeletal proteins; Fluorescence intensities; Mechanical behaviour; Micropipette aspiration; Microtubules; Visco-elastic parameters; Western-blot analysis; Cells; albendazole; F actin; actin; albendazole; antimitotic agent; cytoskeleton protein; antiproliferative activity; Article; cancer cell; cell invasion; cell proliferation assay; cell viability; colorectal cancer; colorectal cancer cell line; controlled study; cytoskeleton; drug effect; drug sensitivity; human; human cell; microfilament; microtubule; priority journal; viscoelasticity; Young modulus; biomechanics; cell survival; colon tumor; cytoskeleton; drug effects; HT 29 cell line; metabolism; pathology; viscosity; Actins; Albendazole; Antimitotic Agents; Biomechanical Phenomena; Cell Survival; Colonic Neoplasms; Cytoskeletal Proteins; Cytoskeleton; Elastic Modulus; HT29 Cells; Humans; Microtubules; Viscosity,2-s2.0-84925347646

Eight electronic medical datasets collected from University of California, Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository were used to evaluate the effectiveness and to justify the performance of the proposed BSMAIRS. Comparisons with several well-known classifiers were conducted based on accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and G-mean. Statistical results concluded that BSMAIRS can be used as an efficient method to handle imbalanced class problems. To further confirm its performance, BSMAIRS was applied to real imbalanced medical data of lung cancer metastasis to the brain that were collected from National Health Insurance Research Database, Taiwan.

Patients with a frozen shoulder were randomized into the physiotherapy group or the lidocaine injection plus physiotherapy (INJPT) group. The subjects in the INJPT group underwent injection of 3 ml of 1% lidocaine into the affected shoulder 10 to 20 minutes before each physiotherapy session.

Methods: Due to the difficulty of making prognoses of prostate cancer, this study proposes a two-stage FNN for prediction. The initial membership function parameters of FNN are determined by cluster analysis. Then, an integration of the optimization version of an artificial immune network (Opt-aiNET) and a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is developed to investigate the relationship between the inputs and outputs. Results: The evaluation results for three benchmark functions show that the proposed two-stage FNN has better performance than the other algorithms. In addition, model evaluation results indicate that the proposed algorithm really can predict prognoses of prostate cancer more accurately. Conclusions: The proposed two-stage FNN is able to learn the relationship between the clinical features and the prognosis of prostate cancer. Once the clinical data are known, the prognosis of prostate cancer patient can be predicted. Furthermore, unlike artificial neural networks, it is much easier to interpret the training results of the proposed network since they are in the form of fuzzy IF-THEN rules.

In this paper, the results from the Assessment of Mitosis Detection Algorithms 2013 (AMIDA13) challenge are described. The challenge was based on a data set consisting of 12 training and 11 testing subjects, with more than one thousand annotated mitotic figures by multiple observers.

The paramagnetic GQDs, named folate-GdGQDs, were successfully prepared by covalently conjugating diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium and folic acid onto the surface of GQDs. The resultant folate-GdGQDs, which showed a longitudinal relaxivity r1 of 11.49 mM-1 s-1, greatly enhanced the brightness of the T1-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images, indicating their potential for use as positive contrast agents for MR imaging (MRI). The feasibility of utilizing the folate-GdGQDs with strong luminescence emissions for targeted imaging of HeLa cells was also evaluated. An in vitro cell (HeLa and HepG2 cells) viability assay and in vivo evaluation of toxicity to the embryonic development of zebrafish showed that these folate-GdGQDs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity and excellent biocompatibility within the given range of concentrations. More importantly, strong therapeutic activity was achieved by loading Dox onto the surfaces of folate-GdGQDs through π-π stacking and hydrophobic interactions, leading to the formation of folate-GdGQD/Dox multifunctional nanocarriers. Approximately 80% of the loaded Dox was released from the folate-GdGQD/Dox nanocarriers under mild acidic conditions (pH 5.0), whereas only 20% of Dox was released at pH 7.0 after 48 h. Furthermore, these multifunctional nanocarriers could efficiently induce an inhibitory effect on HeLa cells, as confirmed by an in vitro cytotoxicity assay. The combined flow cytometry analysis and confocal laser scanning microscopic observation showed that these nanocarriers were efficiently taken up by the cancer cells overexpressing folate receptors. Taken together, these results suggested that the multifunctional nanocarriers could be used as promising targeted drug delivery vehicles for the diagnosis and image-guided chemotherapy of various cancers.

Some basic approaches to gene therapy are (1) the replacement of a mutated gene that causes disease with a healthy normal gene, (2) the inactivation of a mutated gene that functions improperly, and (3) the introduction of a therapeutic gene into diseased cells [2]. Generally, genes must be delivered into the cells using a carrier or a vector because they cannot be directly transferred into cells passively. Vectors can be viral, nonviral, or bacterial based [3,4]. Viruses are the most common type of vectors that have been genetically altered to carry therapeutic genes. Furthermore, viral vectors are generally considered most efficient for gene transfer, and some can easily integrate into the genomic DNA of host cells to provide long-term gene expression [5,6]. However, the administration of viral vectors can trigger immune responses, which can reduce the gene therapy efficiency [7,8]. ? by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,2-s2.0-85028250104

Unfortunately, clinical complications of anterior cervical plate (ACP) systems still occur, such as weak fixation stability and implant loosening. Previous researchers have attempted to ameliorate these complications by varying screw orientations, but the screw orientations are mainly determined according to the investigator’s experiences. Thus, the aim of this study was to discover the optimal screw orientations of ACP systems to achieve acceptable fixation stability using finite element simulations and engineering algorithms. Methods: Three-dimensional finite element models of C3-T2 multi-level segments with an ACP system were first developed to analyze the fixation stability using ANSYS Workbench 14.5. Then, artificial neural networks were applied to create one objective function, and the optimal screw orientations of an ACP system were discovered by genetic algorithms. Finally, the numerical models and the optimization study were validated using biomechanical tests. Results: The results showed that the optimal design of the ACP system had highest fixation stability compared with other ACP designs. The neuro-genetic algorithm has effectively reduced the time and effort required for discovering for the optimal screw orientations of an ACP system. Conclusions: The optimum screw orientation of the ACP system could be successfully discovered, and it revealed excellent fixation stability for the treatment of cervical degenerative disc disease. This study could directly provide the biomechanical rationale and surgical suggestion to orthopedic surgeons. ? 2015, Institute of Machine Design and Operation.

Acid, CA) and 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DSPE)-liposomes were developed. CA was immobilized onto the DSPE-liposomes by EDC/NHS reaction using the carboxyl group of CA and the amino group of DSPE. The characteristics of the resultant CA-modified liposomes were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy, dynamic light scattering, zeta potential, FTIR spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and contact angle measurement. The results show that the particle size and surface charge of the CA-modified liposomes varied with the concentration of CA, and exhibited pH-sensitive behavior. In vitro drug release studies demonstrated the sustained release behavior of the doxorubicin in the CA-modified liposomes, related to the rapid release in the free doxorubicin. Interestingly, the doxorubicin release rate from CA-modified liposomes was lower at higher pH values (pH 7.4) than at lower pH values (pH 4), indicating that the drug carrier displayed pH-sensitive released behavior. Furthermore, CA-modified liposomes exhibited no cytotoxicity toward the fibroblast cells (L-929 cells), suggesting an excellent biocompatibility. Fluorescence and confocal microscopy images showed good cellular internalization of the CA-modified liposomes into the cellular compartment. These results confirm that the novel CA-modified liposomes could respond to pH environment, which is promising for drug controlled release applications, especially in the field of cancer cell therapy (lower pH environments). ?

Through the remote-controlled focused ultrasound (FUS)-triggered drug liberation, therapeutic monocytes show prominent capability of inducing apoptosis of cancer cells.

Inhibition of tumor recurrence with γ-ray pre-irradiated Tramp-C1-bearing mice receiving therapeutic monocytes intravenously alongside the FUS activation at tumor site was significantly observed. Immunohistochemical examination of tumor sections confirms successful cellular transport of therapeutic payloads to hypoxic regions and pronounced cytotoxic action against hypoxic cells. Following the intravenous administration, the cellular-mediated therapeutics can penetrate easily to a depth beyond 150 μm from the nearest blood vessels within pre-irradiated tumor while nanoparticles are severely limited to a depth of ca 10-15 μm.

We also investigated the response induced by AS in beat-to-beat SampEn indexes of LDF signals. Methods: LDF signals were obtained at bilateral TaiYang acupoints in 52 stroke patients. Each assessment involved a 20-minute baseline recording, a 20-minute AS, and a subsequent 20-minute recording. The FDT, FRT, and PW were calculated for each pulse of the LDF signals, and then their SampEn values were calculated. Results: The SampEn values of FRT were significantly larger in the stroke group (1.064 ± 0.052 and p = 0.013 at the stroke side; 1.059 ± 0.055 and p = 0.017 at the controlateral side) than in the control group (0.975 ± 0.120).

In this paper, we presents a novel method for feature selection with the use of opposite sign test (OST) as a local search for the electromagnetism-like mechanism (EM) algorithm, denoted as improved electromagnetism-like mechanism (IEM) algorithm. Nearest neighbor algorithm is served as a classifier for the wrapper method. The proposed IEM algorithm is compared with nine popular feature selection and classification methods. Forty-six datasets from the UCI repository and eight gene expression microarray datasets are collected for comprehensive evaluation. Non-parametric statistical tests are conducted to justify the performance of the methods in terms of classification accuracy and Kappa index. The results confirm that the proposed IEM method is superior to the common state-of-art methods. Furthermore, we apply IEM to predict the occurrence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) after a gestational DM. Our research helps identify the risk factors for this disease; accordingly accurate diagnosis and prognosis can be achieved to reduce the morbidity and mortality rate caused by DM. ? 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Diabetes mellitus; Electromagnetism-like mechanism algorithm; Feature selection; Nearest-neighbor heuristic; Opposite sign test,"Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Classification (of information); Computer aided diagnosis; Diagnosis; Feature extraction; Gene expression; Medical computing; Diabetes mellitus; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Electromagnetism-like mechanism algorithms; Electromagnetism-like mechanisms; Feature selection and classification; Nearest neighbors; Non-parametric statistical tests; Sign test; Data mining; glucose; adult; Article; artificial neural network; classification algorithm; classifier; controlled study; data mining; diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; electromagnetic field; electromagnetism like mechanism algorithm; female; genetic algorithm; glucose blood level; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; k nearest neighbor; major clinical study; middle aged; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonparametric test; opposite sign test; oral glucose tolerance test; prediction; pregnancy diabetes mellitus; principal component analysis; priority journal; radial based function; sign test; support vector machine; algorithm; automated pattern recognition; computer assisted diagnosis; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; electromagnetic field; factual database; procedures; risk factor; theoretical model; Algorithms; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Electromagnetic Fields; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Risk Factors",2-s2.0-84927915684

A quantification strategy is proposed to collect the necessary information for quantification of concentrations in a minimized acquisition time. METHODS: Six transverse and six sagittal EPSI data were collected on healthy volunteers. Metabolite concentrations of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA), total creatine (tCr), total choline (tCho), myo-inositol (mI), and glutamate and glutamine complex (Glx) were quantified using water scaling with partial volume and relaxation correction. Linear regression analysis was performed to extract concentrations in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM). The inter- and intrasubject coefficients of variance (CV) were estimated. RESULTS: Concentrations and fitting errors of sagittal and transverse EPSI were at same level. GM to WM contrast of concentrations was found in NAA, tCr, and tCho. The intersubject CVs revealed greater variability in the sagittal EPSI than in the transverse EPSI. The intrasubject CVs of the transverse EPSI were below 5% for NAA, tCr, and tCho. CONCLUSION: We showed that quantified concentrations of sagittal and transverse EPSI after partial volume correction are comparable and reproducible. The proposed quantification strategy can be conveniently adapted into various MRI protocols. ? 2014 by the American Society of Neuroimaging.",Brain metabolites; Echo planar spectroscopic imaging; Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging; Partial volume correction,choline; creatine; glutamic acid; glutamine; inositol; n acetylaspartic acid; adult; Article; brain metabolism; brain region; echo planar imaging; female; gray matter; human; intermethod comparison; male; neuroimaging; normal human; sagittal echo planar spectroscopic imaging; transverse echo planar spectroscopic imaging; white matter; anatomy and histology; brain; comparative study; echo planar imaging; evaluation study; metabolism; molecular imaging; patient positioning; procedures; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; reproducibility; sensitivity and specificity; young adult; Adult; Brain; Echo-Planar Imaging; Female; Humans; Molecular Imaging; Patient Positioning; Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Young Adult,2-s2.0-84924571811

The study aimed to compare cost-effectiveness ratios of H.?pylori test-and-treat programs to prevent gastric cancer in Taiwan, referring to the nationwide reimbursement database and expected years of life lost. Materials and Methods: During 1998-2009, there were 12,857 females and 24,945 males with gastric adenocarcinoma in Taiwan National Cancer Registry. They were followed up to 2010 and linked to the reimbursement database of National Health Insurance and the national mortality registry to determine lifetime health expenditures and expected years of life lost. Cost-effectiveness ratios of H.?pylori test-and-treat programs for prevention of gastric adenocarcinoma were compared between screenings with 13C-urea breath test and with anti-H.?pylori IgG. Results: The test-and-treat program with anti-H.?pylori IgG to prevent gastric adenocarcinoma had lower incremental cost-effectiveness ratios than that with 13C-urea breath test in both sexes (females: 244 vs 1071 US dollars/life-year; males: 312 vs 1431 US dollars/life-year). Cost saving would be achieved in an endemic area where H.?pylori prevalence was &gt;73.5%, or by selecting subpopulations with high absolute risk reduction rates of cancer after eradication. Moreover, expected years of life lost of gastric adenocarcinoma were higher and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of test-and-treat programs were more cost-effective in young adults (30-69 y/o) than in elders (?70 y/o). Conclusions: The test-and-treat program with anti-H.?pylori IgG shall be cost-effective to prevent gastric adenocarcinoma in a high endemic area, especially beginning at 30?years of age when H.?pylori prevalence rates become stabilized. ? 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Helicobacter pylori; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Prevention and control; Stomach neoplasms,"carbon 13; immunoglobulin G antibody; adult; aged; Article; cancer prevention; cancer screening; cost effectiveness analysis; female; follow up; gross national product; health care cost; Helicobacter pylori; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; risk reduction; stomach adenocarcinoma; Taiwan; Taiwanese; urea breath test; very elderly; adenocarcinoma; cohort analysis; complication; cost benefit analysis; diagnostic test; drug combination; economics; health care cost; Helicobacter Infections; life expectancy; middle aged; procedures; serology; Stomach Neoplasms; Helicobacter pylori; Adenocarcinoma; Aged; Cohort Studies; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Diagnostic Tests, Routine; Drug Therapy, Combination; Female; Health Expenditures; Helicobacter Infections; Humans; Life Expectancy; Male; Middle Aged; Serologic Tests; Stomach Neoplasms; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84924415506

Patients with OSA have a high risk of various comorbid medical diseases. Polysomnography (PSG) is the current gold standard for diagnosing OSA but is time consuming and expensive. This study aims to identify a sensitive screening parameter that can be used by clinicians to determine the time of referral for PSG examination in Taiwan. Eighty-seven patients, including 67 males and 20 females, were included in this study. We divided the patients into two groups: training data (n = 58) and testing group (n = 29). Pearson χ2 test was used to perform bivariate analysis, and a decision tree was used to build a model. The decision model selected the frequency of desaturation &gt; 4% per hour (DI4) as the indicator of OSA influence. The testing data accuracy of the C4.5 decision tree was 82.80%. External data were also used to validate the model reliability. The accuracy of the external data was 95.96%. Approximately one-third of patients with DI4 between 11 and 33 suffered from OSA.

The segmentation of the RV is a difficult task due to the variable shape of the RV and its ill-defined borders in these images. The aim of this paper is to evaluate several RV segmentation algorithms on common data. More precisely, we report here the results of the Right Ventricle Segmentation Challenge (RVSC), concretized during the MICCAI'12 Conference with an on-site competition. Seven automated and semi-automated methods have been considered, along them three atlas-based methods, two prior based methods, and two prior-free, image-driven methods that make use of cardiac motion. The obtained contours were compared against a manual tracing by an expert cardiac radiologist, taken as a reference, using Dice metric and Hausdorff distance. We herein describe the cardiac data composed of 48 patients, the evaluation protocol and the results. Best results show that an average 80% Dice accuracy and a 1. cm Hausdorff distance can be expected from semi-automated algorithms for this challenging task on the datasets, and that an automated algorithm can reach similar performance, at the expense of a high computational burden.

However, educators have indicated that most children might fail to realize the importance and meaning of health education content owing to the lack of authentic scenarios and daily life experience. With the advancement of computer technologies, researchers have tried to develop multimedia learning content in order to improve students' learning performance. Among various technology-enhanced learning alternatives, digital game-based learning has been recognized as a highly potential approach to motivating students. However, several previous studies have indicated that, without properly incorporating learning content into game scenarios, the effectiveness of digital game-based learning might not be as good as expected in comparison with conventional technology-enhanced learning. In this study, a contextual digital game was developed for improving students' learning performance in an elementary school health education course. A quasi experiment was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach by situating the experimental group in the game-based learning scenario and the control group to learn with conventional e-books. The experimental results showed that the proposed approach not only improved the students' learning motivation, but also their learning achievement and problem-solving competences. Moreover, the significant two-way interaction suggested that the contextual game-based learning approach benefited the higher motivation students more than the lower motivation ones in terms of the advanced knowledge, showing the importance and potential of applying contextual games to health education activities. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Each carrier's available transportation capacity (e.g., number of containers) is not deterministic since the transportation capacity may be partially reserved by other customers. Thus, the supply chain network can be regarded as a Stochastic Supply Chain Network (SSCN). In an SSCN with multiple suppliers and markets, the goods may be damaged due to traffic accident, natural disaster, inclement weather, time, or collision during transportation such that the intact goods may not meet the customer's demands. In addition, the goods supplied by a specified supplier cannot exceed its production capacity, and the total transportation cost cannot exceed a budget. SSCN reliability is defined as the probability that the SSCN can successfully deliver goods to multiple customers subject to a specified level of damage, budget, and limited production capacity. An algorithm is proposed to evaluate the SSCN reliability based on minimal paths. A real case study of a pineapple supply chain network is utilized to demonstrate the utility of the proposed algorithm. ? 2014 Copyright ?

Methods: Our study evaluated 299 patients undergoing retro-pubic radical prostatectomy or robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy surgical procedures with pelvic lymph node dissection. The results were intended to predict the pathological stage of prostate cancer (T2 or T3) after radical surgery. The predictive ability of ANN was compared with LR and validation of the 2007 Partin Tables was estimated by the areas under the receiving operating characteristic curve (AUCs). Results: Of the 299 patients we evaluated, 109 (36.45%) displayed prostate cancer with extra-capsular extension (ECE), and 190 (63.55%) displayed organ-confined disease (OCD). LR analysis showed that only PSA and BMI were statistically significant predictors of prostate cancer with capsule invasion. Overall, ANN outperformed LR significantly (0.795±0.023 versus 0.746±0.025, p=0.016). Validation using the current Partin Tables for the participants of our study was assessed, and the predictive capacity of AUC for OCD was 0.695. Conclusion: ANN was superior to LR at predicting OCD in prostate cancer. Compared with the validation of current Partin Tables for the Taiwanese population, the ANN model resulted in larger AUCs and more accurate prediction of the pathologic stage of prostate cancer. ? 2014.",Artificial neural network; Capsule invasion; Partin tables; Prostate neoplasm,prostate specific antigen; prostate specific antigen; adult; aged; Article; artificial neural network; body mass; cancer localization; digital rectal examination; Gleason score; human; human tissue; laparoscopic surgery; lymph node dissection; major clinical study; male; middle aged; prediction; prostate biopsy; prostate cancer; prostatectomy; Taiwanese; transrectal ultrasonography; tumor invasion; blood; cancer staging; pathology; prostate tumor; statistical model; Aged; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Staging; Neural Networks (Computer); Prostate-Specific Antigen; Prostatic Neoplasms,2-s2.0-84908099454

Some nonstemmed systems were developed to avoid rasping off the intramedullary canal and evacuating the bone marrow due to stem insertion.Methods. In this study, the finite-element models of one intact, one stemmed, and two nonstemmed femora with minimal removal of the healthy neck were investigated to evaluate their biomechanical effects. The resurfacing (ball-shaped) and fitting (neck-shaped) systems were respectively selected as the representative of the ready- and custom-made nonstemmed implants. The stress distribution and interface micromotion were selected as the comparison indices.Results: The results showed that stress distributions of the two nonstemmed femora are consistently more similar to the intact femur than the stemmed one. Around the proximal femur, the stem definitely induces the stress-shielding phenomenon of its counterparts. The fitting system with the anatomy-shaped cup can make intimate contact with the neck cortex and reduce the bone-cup micromotion and the implant stress. Comparatively, the reamed femoral head provides weaker support to the resurfacing cup causing higher interfacial micromotion.Conclusions: The reserved femoral neck could act as the load-transferring medium from the acetabular cup, femoral neck, to the diaphysial bone, thus depressing the stress-shielding effect below the neck region. If the hip-cup construct can be definitely stabilized, the nonstemmed design could be an alternative of hip arthroplasty for the younger or the specific patients with the disease limited only to the femoral head. ? 2014Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Finite-element; Hip; Nonstemmed; Stemmed; Stress-shielding,"adult; Article; biomechanics; case report; femur head; finite element analysis; human; male; mechanical stress; nonstemmed hip prosthesis; range of motion; stemmed hip prosthesis; total hip prosthesis; young adult; devices; femur; femur head; hip; hip arthroplasty; procedures; prosthesis; radiography; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Femur; Femur Head; Finite Element Analysis; Hip Joint; Humans; Male; Prosthesis Design; Stress, Mechanical; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84907968350

However, by intravenous delivery to the target tumor the distribution of the drug had its limitations and caused serious side effect on non-target organs. Therefore, in this study, we are going to develop a localized eluting stent, named PDT-chemo stent, covered with gemcitabine (GEM) and hematoporphyrin (HP). Methods: The prototype of PDT-chemo stent was made through electrospinning and electrospraying dual-processes with an electrical charge to cover the stent with a drug-storing membrane from polymer liquid. The design of prototype used PU as the material of the backing layer, and PCL/PEG blends in different molar ratio of 9:1 and of 1:4 were used in two drug-storing layers with GEM and HP loaded respectively. Results: The optical microscopy revealed that the backing layer was formed in fine fibers from electrospinning, while drug-storing layers, attributed to the droplets from electrospraying process. The covered membrane, the morphology of which was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), covered the stent surface homogeneously without crack appearances. The GEM had almost 100% of electrosprayed efficiency than 70% HP loaded on the covered membrane due to the different solubility of drug in PEG/PCL blends. Drug release study confirmed the two-phased drug release pattern by regulating in different molar ratio of PEG/PCL blends polymer. Conclusions: The result proves that the PDT-chemo stent is composed of a first burst-releasing phase from HP and a later slow-releasing phase from GEM eluting. This two-phase of drug eluting stent may provide a new prospect of localized and controlled release treatment for cholangiocarcinoma disease. ? 2014 Chen et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",Biliary drug-eluting stent; Chemotherapy; Cholangiocarcinoma; Electrospinning and Electrospraying; Photodynamic therapy,"Photodynamic therapy; Cholangiocarcinoma; Drug-eluting stents; Electrospraying; Chemotherapy; gemcitabine; hematoporphyrin; macrogol; organic solvent; politef; polycaprolactone; polymer; polyurethan; silicone; stainless steel; tetrahydrofuran; deoxycytidine; gemcitabine; Article; bile duct carcinoma; biliary stent; cancer chemotherapy; controlled release formulation; controlled study; drug eluting stent; drug release; drug solubility; elasticity; electrospinning; electrospraying; emulsion; hydrophilicity; inoperable cancer; investigative procedures; microscopy; photodynamic therapy; scanning electron microscopy; tumor microenvironment; analogs and derivatives; chemistry; equipment design; photochemotherapy; procedures; Deoxycytidine; Drug-Eluting Stents; Equipment Design; Microscopy, Electron, Scanning; Photochemotherapy; Polymers",2-s2.0-84910084377

Here, we report a facile strategy to prepare dual-functional nanomaterials consisting of QDs and an anticancer drug. Hydrophilic AgInS 2/ZnS QDs were obtained through an ultrasonication process by introducing the amphiphilic polymer, poly(maleic anhydride-alt-1-octadecene) (PMAO). Subsequently, the anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) was covalently coupled to the surface of the AgInS2/ZnS QDs by carbodiimide chemistry. The MTT [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide] cell proliferation assay indicated that these hydrophilic PMAO-coated AgInS2/ZnS QDs exhibited negligible cytotoxicity. Human cervical (HeLa) cancer cells had &gt;80% cell viability after 24 h at concentrations of up to 300 μg/mL. Confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the AgInS2/ZnS QDs conjugated with MTX were taken up effectively by HeLa cells. In addition, this nanomaterial was shown to have a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect in cancer cells by the MTT assay. These important features suggest that AgInS2/ZnS QDs conjugated with MTX might be a novel candidate for cancer therapeutics and diagnosis in future. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Biomaterials; Nanocomposites; Polymeric composites,Biological materials; Biomaterials; Cell proliferation; Diagnosis; Diseases; Drug delivery; Hydrophilicity; Nanocomposites; Nanostructured materials; Semiconductor quantum dots; Amphiphilic polymers; Antiproliferative effect; Cancer therapeutics; Carbodiimide chemistry; Confocal laser scanning microscopy; Important features; Methotrexate (MTX); Polymeric composites; Zinc sulfide,2-s2.0-84901282031

One critical step in PPTT is to effectively deliver gold nanoparticles into the cells. This study demonstrates that the delivery of gold nanorods (AuNRs) can be greatly enhanced by combining the following three mechanisms: AuNRs encapsulated in protein-shell microbubbles (AuMBs), molecular targeting, and sonoporation employing acoustic cavitation of microbubbles (MBs). Both in vitro and in vivo tests were performed. For molecular targeting, the AuMBs were modified with anti-VEGFR2. Once bound to the angiogenesis markers, the MBs were destroyed by ultrasound to release the AuNRs and the release was confirmed by photoacoustic measurements. Additionally, acoustic cavitation was induced during MB destruction for sonoporation (i.e., increase in transient cellular permeability). The measured inertial cavitation dose was positively correlated with the temperature increase at the tumor site. The quantity of AuNRs delivered into the cells was also determined by measuring the mass spectrometry and observed using third-harmonic-generation microscopy and two-photon fluorescence microscopy. A temperature increase of 20°C was achieved in vitro. The PPTT results in vivo also demonstrated that the temperature increase (>45°C) provided a sufficiently high degree of hyperthermia. Therefore, synergistic delivery of AuNRs was demonstrated.",,"angiogenesis inhibitor; gold; metal nanoparticle; animal; C57BL mouse; capillary permeability; cell membrane permeability; drug effects; drug screening; female; human; hyperthermic therapy; Melanoma, Experimental; microbubble; nonobese diabetic mouse; SCID mouse; therapeutic use; tumor cell line; ultrasound; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Animals; Capillary Permeability; Cell Line, Tumor; Cell Membrane Permeability; Female; Gold; Humans; Hyperthermia, Induced; Melanoma, Experimental; Metal Nanoparticles; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Inbred NOD; Mice, SCID; Microbubbles; Sonication; Xenograft Model Antitumor Assays",2-s2.0-84904497018

The oligonucleotide-bound 2DPRG alone produces insignificant structure change, but upon hybridization with hgDNA584 leads to a dramatic change of the pillar scale due to hgDNA584 filling inside the 2DPRG layers. The performance of the sensor was evaluated by capturing hgDNA584 on the oligonucleotide-bound 2DPRGs and measuring the effective refractive index (neff), resulting of color change from pure blue to red, observed by naked eyes along an incident angle of 20-30°. The surface-bound 2DPRG based assay with the chemoresponsive diffraction grating signal transduction scheme results in an experimentally simple DNA detection protocol, displaying attributes of both detection methodologies: the high sensitivity and selectivity afforded by 2DPRG probes and the experimental simplicity, and miniaturization potential provided by the diffraction-based sensing technology.? 2013 Elsevier B.V.",DNA detection; Effective medium theory; Refractive index; Two-dimensional periodic grating,"Covalent bonds; Diffraction; Diffraction gratings; Diseases; DNA; Oligonucleotides; Probes; Refractive index; Signal transduction; Silicon oxides; Surgery; Biological specimens; DNA detection; Effective medium theories; Effective refractive index; Functionalized surfaces; Periodic gratings; Sensing technology; Verylarge-scale integrations (VLSI); Two dimensional; disulfide; genomic DNA; oligonucleotide; silicon dioxide; DNA; article; biosensor; breast cancer; breast surgery; cancer recurrence; color; diffraction; disulfide bond; DNA determination; DNA hybridization; DNA microarray; DNA structure; electronics; grating; mathematical analysis; molecular probe; refraction index; sensitivity and specificity; signal transduction; two dimensional periodic relief grating; Breast Neoplasms; devices; equipment design; evaluation study; female; genetic procedures; human; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; nucleic acid hybridization; refractometry; Biosensing Techniques; Breast Neoplasms; DNA; Equipment Design; Female; Humans; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Nucleic Acid Hybridization; Refractometry; Sensitivity and Specificity",2-s2.0-84887588053

In this study, adsorption was highlighted as a low cost and effective pathway to remove amoxicillin and ampicillin from aqueous solutions. Montmorillonite (Na-MMT) and myristyltrimethylammonium (MTA)-intercalated montmorillonite (O-MMT) were employed as the adsorbing solids. Static adsorption experiments were performed at three temperatures (303.15 K, 313.15 K and 323.15 K) for single antibiotic systems. The adsorption isotherm curves at all temperatures exhibited an L2-type isotherm. The Freundlich and Langmuir models were applied to analyze single adsorption isotherm data. The maximum sorption capacity of 0.124-0.133 mmol g-1 for amoxicillin and 0.143-0.157 mmol g-1 for ampicillin was estimated for O-MMT sorbent from Langmuir fitting. A modified extended-Langmuir model with the inclusion of surface coverage was proposed for analysis of binary adsorption isotherm data. The fitness of the modified extended-Langmuir model was superior to the original model.

BN is graphically represented using bioinformatics variables and can be used to support an informative medical decision/observation by using probabilistic reasoning. In this study, we propose such a BN to describe and predict the occurrence of brain metastasis from lung cancer. A nationwide database containing more than 50,000 cases of cancer patients from 1996 to 2010 in Taiwan was used in this study. The BN topology for studying brain metastasis from lung cancer was rigorously examined by domain experts/doctors. We used three statistical measures, namely, the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, to evaluate the performances of the proposed BN model and to compare it with three competitive approaches, namely, naive Bayes (NB), logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM). Experimental results show that no significant differences are observed in accuracy or specificity among the four models, while the proposed BN outperforms the others in terms of sampled average sensitivity. Moreover the proposed BN has advantages compared with the other approaches in interpreting how brain metastasis develops from lung cancer. It is shown to be easily understood by physicians, to be efficient in modeling non-linear situations, capable of solving stochastic medical problems, and handling situations wherein information are missing in the context of the occurrence of brain metastasis from lung cancer. ? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Bayesian network; Brain metastasis; Lung cancer,"Bioinformatics; Biological organs; Diseases; Pathology; Support vector machines; Uncertainty analysis; Average sensitivities; Brain metastasis; Cancer metastasis; Logistic regressions; Lung Cancer; Medical decision making; Probabilistic reasoning; Statistical measures; Bayesian networks; adult; aged; article; Bayes theorem; Bayesian learning; bayesian network; bioinformatics; brain metastasis; cancer patient; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; female; human; intermethod comparison; logistic regression analysis; lung cancer; major clinical study; male; middle aged; physician; prediction; predictive value; priority journal; probability; sensitivity and specificity; stochastic model; support vector machine; Taiwan; Bayesian network; Brain metastasis; Lung cancer; Aged; Algorithms; Bayes Theorem; Brain Neoplasms; Computational Biology; Female; Humans; Lung Neoplasms; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Sensitivity and Specificity; Taiwan",2-s2.0-84895763665

This study predicted coefficient of performance (COP) for refrigeration equipment under varying amounts of refrigerant (R404A) with the aids of data mining (DM) techniques. The performance of artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machines (SVMs), classification and regression tree (CART), multiple regression (MR), generalized linear regression (GLR), and chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID) were applied within DM process. After obtaining the COP value, abnormal equipment conditions can be evaluated for refrigerant leakage. Analytical results from cross-fold validation method are compared to determine the best models. The study shows that DM techniques can be used for accurately and efficiently predicting COP. In the liquid leakage phase, ANNs provide the best performance. In the vapor leakage phase, the best model is the GLR model. Experimental results confirm that systematic analyses of model construction processes are effective for evaluating and optimizing refrigeration equipment performance. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The highest R6G signal was attained with a silica layer of 1-2 nm thickness. The self-focusing character originates from the antibody-antigen interaction, which facilitates the SERS probes assembly and significantly increases the detection sensitivity of the CEA. Our results show that the SERS technique is able to detect CEA within a wide concentration range.

Without the stem, the cup over the femoral head can be stabilized by anatomic fitness of the cup interior and mechanical fixation of the auxiliary screws. Methods Using finite-element method, neck-shaped systems with two bone-cup fitness situations and four types of screw breakages are systematically investigated to evaluate their biomechanical effects on construct performances. The construct stresses and interfacial micromotion were chosen for comparison between two bone-cup fitness situations and four types of screw breakages. Findings The screw breakage deteriorates the stresses of the mating screw and the neck cup and loosens the bone-cup interfaces. The breakages of central and locking screws decrease the bone stress by about 43.2% and 12.7%, respectively. This indicates that the central screw is a more effective load-bearer for the superimposed cup than the locking screw. As compared with the fitting cup, the stress of cup and the bone stresses of the unfitting cup obviously increase. This demonstrates that the load-transferring path at the cup bottom is important in directly relieving the prosthetic stresses. Interpretation Any screw design inducing stress concentration should be validated to avoid screw breakage. Comparatively, surgical unfitness has a more significant effect on the construct performance than does the screw breakage. Even for custom-made cups, cautious preparation of the neck resection is still necessary to ensure intimate bone-cup contact. ? 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Finite-element; Hip nonstemmed; Neck cup; Screw breakage; Stress-shielding,"Aseptic loosening; Biomechanical effects; Hip arthroplasties; Locking screws; Mechanical fixation; Neck cup; Stress performance; Stress shielding; Biomechanics; Bone; Coal breakage; Finite element method; Health; Locks (fasteners); Shielding; Stress concentration; Screws; article; bone implant; bone resection; bone screw; bone stress; central screw; femur head; hip prosthesis; human; locking screw; motion; priority journal; prosthesis failure; rigidity; Finite-element; Hip nonstemmed; Neck cup; Screw breakage; Stress-shielding; Arthroplasty, Replacement, Hip; Biomechanical Phenomena; Bone Screws; Equipment Failure Analysis; Femur Head; Femur Neck; Finite Element Analysis; Hip Prosthesis; Humans; Internal Fixators; Male; Muscle Contraction; Prosthesis Design; Prosthesis Failure; Stress, Mechanical; Weight-Bearing; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84896716745

One acceptable mechanism to initiate events is a 'seed' aggregation of free monomeric peptides into toxic soluble amyloid oligomers and subsequently into deposits of insoluble fibrils. Since all of these events take place in the brain astrocytes it suggests an interference between arginine-metabolising enzymes and the Aβ-peptides. Through kinetic, fluorimetric and thermodynamic analyses two such enzymes - neuronal nitric oxide synthase and peptidyl arginine deiminase - are, not only inhibited by structural fragments of Aβ1-42 but are catalytic towards fibrillogenesis. The interaction of the peptide fragments with each enzyme is endothermic, non-spontaneous and involves hydrophobic-hydrophobic associations with a single binding site. The trigger for this series of events focusses in particularly on Aβ17-21 with two phenylalanines [Phe19; Phe20], the three glycine zipper motifs [Aβ25-29; Aβ29-33; Aβ33-37] and the triple sequence [Aβ25-37] that includes two isoleucine residues [Ile31; Ile32]. FRET studies show the Aβ-peptide fragments bind to the enzymes &lt;3.0 nm from a single surface tryptophan. Free Aβ monomers bind to an enzyme, formulate a nucleus, initiate their aggregation and subsequently become entrapped and couple to the existing aggregated monomers, leading to an elongated fibril. Silver and gold nanoparticles reverse fibrillogenesis! They are surrounded by the amyloid peptide molecules in vivo to effectively deplete their concentration. This does not allow any 'lag' time, nor prevent the formation of critical nuclei for the initial association phase and, inevitably, prevent fibril initiation and elongation. This review focusses on the function and action of arginine metabolising enzymes with respect to the formation of senile plaques and amyloid peptide aggregation to facilitate more of an understanding of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer disease. ? 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Alzheimers disease; Arginine metabolizing enzymes; Fibrillogenesis; Inhibition; Mechanisms; Neuronal nitric oxide synthase; Peptidyl arginine deiminase,amyloid beta protein; amyloid beta-protein (1-42); arginine; arginine deiminase; enzyme inhibitor; hydrolase; neuronal nitric oxide synthase; peptide fragment; Alzheimer disease; amino acid sequence; antagonists and inhibitors; chemistry; enzymology; human; metabolism; molecular genetics; thermodynamics; Alzheimer Disease; Amino Acid Sequence; Amyloid beta-Peptides; Arginine; Enzyme Inhibitors; Humans; Hydrolases; Molecular Sequence Data; Nitric Oxide Synthase Type I; Peptide Fragments; Thermodynamics,2-s2.0-84894483773

This study performed LDF measurements on the skin surface around the leg to verify if beat-to-beat waveform and spectral analysis can help to discriminate the MBF characteristics between PCOS and healthy subjects.

Beat-to-beat waveform and spectral analysis was performed on the LDF signals to obtain the AD, FDT, FRT, and REC of five frequency bands. Results: FRT was significantly larger, AD was significantly smaller, REC of the myogenic-related band was significantly smaller and REC of the heartbeat-related band was significantly larger in the PCOS than in the control subjects. Conclusion: This study is the first to reveal that time-domain waveform and spectral analysis performed on skin-surface LDF signals can be used to discriminate the differences in the MBF perfusion condition and the microcirculatory regulatory activities at local vascular beds between PCOS and healthy subjects.

Clinical practices of risk assessment with consideration of familial pathogen interaction might reduce the need for therapy, improve patient outcomes, and ultimately reduce oral disease burden. Materials and Methods: In this study, we enrolled 30 parent-child pairs, with the children exhibiting complete deciduous dentition or mixed dentition with only permanent first molars. Clinical statuses were evaluated using caries and periodontal disease indicators, including the sum of decay and the number of missing or filled teeth (DMFT) for adults, decay, extraction caused by dental disease, and filled teeth (deft), for children, probing depth, and plaque control record (PCR). Supra- and sub-gingival bacteria were determined based on semi-quantitative measurements of microbial infection by using data from the Dentocult? SM test (caries-related organisms) and the PerioCheck? test (periodontal disease-related organisms). Results: No statistically significant relationship was detected between the prevalence of periodontal pathogens and that of cariogenic pathogens in the oral cavity. However, the clinical status of caries (DMFT) was negatively correlated with the clinical status of periodontal disease (pocket depth) in parents who were infected with dominant periodontal pathogens (r = 20.59, p<0.01). Parents' DMFT scores were positively correlated with children's deft and PCR scores. PCR and deft scores of children appeared to decrease significantly with the parent's pocket depth. Conclusion: The study showed that the quantity of caries pathogens were not significant related to periodontal pathogens, but the caries clinical outcome is negative related with periodontal clinical outcome between familial pairs. ? 2014 Huang et al.",,"article; child; child parent relation; clinical article; controlled study; dental caries; Dentocult test; female; human; male; molar tooth; mouth flora; mouth hygiene; PerioCheck test; periodontal disease; polymerase chain reaction; prevalence; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; scoring system; screening test; tooth extraction; adult; deciduous tooth; dental caries; Dental Plaque; health survey; microbiology; parent; preschool child; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Dental Caries; Dental Plaque; DMF Index; Female; Humans; Male; Parents; Prevalence; Tooth, Deciduous",2-s2.0-84900464876

Cytoskeletal reorganization alters these characteristics in different grades of cancer cells. In the present study based on the micropipette aspiration method, whole body evaluation for two different colon cancer cells was performed to determine viscoelastic parameters of the cells. A finite element model was developed for verification of experiments and predicting some behaviors of cells. Western blot analysis and fluorescence intensity for actin microfilaments and microtubules were performed to measure cell content of the proteins. It was illustrated that the proportion of microtubules and actin microfilaments is different in grade I and grade IV colon cancer cells in a manner that microtubules attain an effectual role in progressive reorganization of cytoskeleton in transition from nonaggressive to malignant phenotypes in cancer cells. Furthermore, it was concluded that larger instantaneous Young's modulus value for high grade cells is related to the existence of extensively build-up actin networks at the cell cortex. Based on the cell mechanics results, a simple parameter is suggested for sorting different grades of colon cancer cells. ? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Cancer cell mechanics; Finite element analysis; Micropipette aspiration; Rate of deformability,"Actin microfilaments; Biomechanical properties; Cancer cells; Cancer progression; Fluorescence intensities; Micropipette aspiration; Visco-elastic parameters; Western-blot analysis; Biomechanics; Cell culture; Diseases; Elastic moduli; Finite element method; Proteins; Cells; albendazole; actin filament; article; aspiration; biomechanics; cancer cell culture; cancer grading; colon cancer; controlled study; finite element analysis; fluorescence analysis; micropipette aspiration; microtubule; nerve cell network; phase transition; priority journal; validation process; viscoelasticity; Western blotting; Young modulus; Cancer cell mechanics; Finite element analysis; Micropipette aspiration; Rate of deformability; Actin Cytoskeleton; Actins; Albendazole; Blotting, Western; Cell Movement; Colonic Neoplasms; Cytoskeleton; Elastic Modulus; Elasticity; Finite Element Analysis; HT29 Cells; Humans; Microtubules; Viscosity",2-s2.0-84891836092

The availability of a variety of sensors creates many new opportunities for data mining applications. This paper proposes a mobile phone-based system that employs the accelerometer and the gyroscope signals for AR. To evaluate the proposed system, we employ a data set where 30 volunteers performed daily activities such as walking, lying, upstairs, sitting, and standing. The result shows that the features extracted from the gyroscope enhance the classification accuracy in term of dynamic activities recognition such as walking and upstairs. A comparison study shows that the recognition accuracies of the proposed framework using various classification algorithms are higher than previous works. ? 2014 IEEE.",Accelerometer; Activity Recognition; Classifier; Gyroscope; Smartphone,Accelerometers; Artificial intelligence; Cellular telephone systems; Classifiers; Consumer products; Cybernetics; E-learning; Gyroscopes; Learning systems; Mobile devices; Pattern recognition; Walking aids; Acceleration sensors; Activities recognition; Activity recognition; Classification accuracy; Classification algorithm; Data mining applications; Direction sensors; Recognition accuracy; Data mining,2-s2.0-84921471396

Nineteen subjects with AS completed either COMB (n=9) or ROM (n=10) program. The COMB program included range-of-motion, strengthening, and aerobic exercise while the ROM program consisted of daily range-of-motion exercise only. After exercise instruction, subjects in each group performed home exercise for 3 months.

After exercise, the COMB group showed significant improvement in peak oxygen uptake (12.3%, P=0.008) and BASFI (P=0.028), and the changed score between pre- and postexercise data was significantly greater in the COMB group regarding peak oxygen uptake and BASFI.

Objective. This study investigated the load-transferring mechanisms of 2 dynamic fixators and the fixator-induced effects on the junctional problem of the adjacent segments. Summary of Background Data: The mobility and flexibility of Dynesys screw-spacer and Cosmic screw-hinge joints preserve motion and share loads for the transition segment. However, the differences in tissue responses and fixator mechanisms among these 2 fixators have not/en investigated extensively. Methods: A lumbosacral model from L1 to S1 levels was developed and subjected to muscular contraction, ligamentous interconnection, compressive force, and trunk moment. A static fixator was instrumented at the moderately degenerative L4-L5 segment to serve as a comparison baseline. Subsequently, the 2 fixators were instrumented at the mildly degenerative L3-L4 segment. The tissue responses of the adjacent segments and the load transmission at the screw-spacer and bonescrew interfaces were compared. Results: Both systems show the ability to protect the transition segment but deteriorate the adjacent segments. The screw-hinge joint and the stiffer rod of the Cosmic system significantly constrained the motion pattern of the transition segment. Comparatively, the Dynesys screw-spacer interfaces make contact with and depart from each other during motion; thus providing higher mobility to the transition segment. However, the highly stressed distribution at the Cosmic bonescrew causes the screw and hinge prone to pullout and fatigue failures. Conclusion: Cosmic fixation can/tter protect the disc and facet joint of the transition segment than can the Dynesys. However, the screw-hinge joint strictly constrains intersegmental motion and deteriorates the junctional problem. The Cosmic system can/chosen to treat more severely degenerative transition segments. With higher flexibility, the Dynesys system is recommended for the transition segment that is healthy or mildly degenerative.

Participants: Fifteen women with bilateral medial knee OA and 15 healthy control subjects (N=30). Interventions: LWAS. Main Outcome Measures: Subjective knee pain and objective biomechanical indices, namely, joint angles and moments in the frontal plane, frontal plane ground reaction force and lever arm, as well as medial/lateral center of mass and center of pressure during gait. Results: When wearing the LWAS, knee pain during gait in persons with medial knee OA decreased (P=.01).

Conclusions: Although peak internal knee abductor moment and knee pain were immediately reduced during gait when wearing the LWAS, increased ankle invertor moments were found, suggesting that the LWAS should be used with caution.

In vitro cytotoxicity and hyperthermia (inductive heating) studies were evaluated against colorectal cancer (CT-26 cells) with high-frequency magnetic field (HFMF) exposure. MTT assay revealed that these drug carriers exhibited no cytotoxicity against L-929 cells, suggesting excellent biocompatibility. When the magnetic liposomes with 1?μM doxorubicin was used to treat CT-26 cells in combination with HFMF exposure, approximately 56% cells were killed and found to be more effective than either hyperthermia or chemotherapy treatment individually.

By selecting sodium tellurite as the Te source, cadmium chloride as the Cd source, mercaptosuccinic acid (MSA) as the capping agent, and a borate-acetic acid buffer solution with a pH range of 5-8, CdTe nanocrystals with four colors (blue to orange) were conveniently prepared at 100 °C under microwave irradiation in less than one hour (reaction time: 10-60 min). The influence of parameters such as the pH, Cd:Te molar ratio, and reaction time on the emission range and quantum yield percentage (QY%) was investigated. The structures and compositions of the prepared CdTe QDs were characterized by transmission electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, selective area electron diffraction, and X-ray powder diffraction experiments. The formation mechanism of the QDs is discussed in this paper. Furthermore, AS1141-aptamer-conjugated CdTe QDs in the U87MG glioblastoma cell line were assessed with a fluorescence microscope. The obtained results showed that the best conditions for obtaining a high QY of approximately 87 % are a pH of 6, a Cd:Te molar ratio of 5:1, and a 30-min reaction time at 100 °C under microwave irradiation. The results showed that AS1141-aptamer-conjugated CdTe QDs could enter tumor cells efficiently. It could be concluded that a facile high-fluorescence-strength QD conjugated with a DNA aptamer, AS1411, which can recognize the extracellular matrix protein nucleolin, can specifically target U87MG human glioblastoma cells.

The present study used skin-surface laser-Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measurements and beat-to-beat waveform analysis with the aim of discriminating the microcirculatory blood flow (MBF) characteristics in stroke subjects subdivided into two groups according to their walking ability. Five-minute LDF measurements were performed in the following groups: Group A (cannot walk independently; n = 17), Group B (can walk independently; n = 11), and Group C (healthy controls; n = 17). The pulse width (PW) and foot delay time (FDT) and their coefficients of variation (PWCV and FDTCV, respectively) were calculated for the beat-to-beat LDF waveform. The FDT in Group A and the blood-pressure-normalized PW in Group C were significantly longer than the corresponding values in the other groups, and PWCV and FDTCV were significantly larger in Group C than in Group A. To our knowledge this is the first study demonstrating the feasibility of using a beat-to-beat LDF waveform index to discriminate between stroke subjects with different walking abilities and between stroke and normal subjects. It provides a noninvasive and real-time method for discriminating MBF characteristics, and thus could aid the development of an index for the early detection of stroke or for evaluating the recovery condition in stroke patients. ? 2014 IOS Press and the authors.

We investigated how integrating cloud-based manometers with physician order entry systems benefits our outpatient chronic kidney disease patients compared with typical BP tracking systems. Methods: We randomly assigned 36 chronic kidney disease patients to use cloud-based manometers integrated with physician order entry systems or typical BP recording sheets, and followed the patients for 6 months. The composite outcome was that the patients saw improvement both in BP and renal function. Results: We compared the systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP), and renal function of our patients at 0 months, 3 months, and 6 months after using the integrated manometers and typical BP monitoring sheets. Nighttime SBP and DBP were significantly lower in the study group compared with the control group. Serum creatinine level in the study group improved significantly compared with the control group after the end of Month 6 (2.83±2.0 vs. 4.38±3.0, p=0.018). Proteinuria improved nonsignificantly in Month 6 in the study group compared with the control group (1.05±0.9 vs. 1.90±1.3, p=0.09). Both SBP and DBP during the nighttime hours improved significantly in the study group compared with the baseline. Conclusion: In pre-end-stage renal disease patients, regularly monitoring BP by integrating cloud-based manometers appears to result in a significant decrease in creatinine and improvement in nighttime BP control. Estimated glomerular filtration rate and proteinuria were found to be improved nonsignificantly, and thus, larger population and longer follow-up studies may be needed. ? 2014.",Blood pressure monitoring; Chronic kidney disease; Cloud-based manometers integrated to physician order entry systems; Usual blood pressure record sheets,"creatinine; aged; Article; blood pressure measurement; blood pressure monitoring; blood pressure regulation; chronic kidney disease; clinical article; cloud based manometer; computerized provider order entry; controlled study; creatinine blood level; diastolic blood pressure; end stage renal disease; female; glomerulus filtration rate; human; kidney function; male; manometer; proteinuria; randomized controlled trial; systolic blood pressure; blood pressure; chronic kidney failure; hospital information system; integrated health care system; kidney; manometry; middle aged; pathophysiology; Aged; Blood Pressure; Delivery of Health Care, Integrated; Female; Humans; Kidney; Male; Manometry; Medical Order Entry Systems; Middle Aged; Renal Insufficiency, Chronic",2-s2.0-84915805534

First, we identify the users’ transportation mode to get sequential data of the users’ motion mode. Then, we get the semantic meaning as behavior semantic features from the places where users have stopped and visited for a while.

The glottal area was also quantized. As the tongue base movements affected the position of laryngoscope and saliva would result in unclear images, this study used the gray scale adaptive entropy value to set the threshold in order to establish an elimination system.

The glottis area segmentation was corrected, and the glottal area waveform pattern was drawn automatically to assist in vocal fold diagnosis.

Active targeting nanoparticles (NPs) with therapeutic capability are a major requirement of cancer therapeutics. Herein, we present a general one-pot approach for simultaneously (1) achieving the phase transfer of various NPs from an organic solvent to an aqueous phase, and (2) grafting an active targeting ligand (folate) via electrostatic interactions as well as a therapeutic agent (cisplatin) via coordinative interactions of platinum atoms with carboxylic acid ligands on the surface of the NPs. This approach allows rapid, simple, and versatile bioconjugation without the need for additional crosslinking reagents. Taking AgInS2/ZnS quantum dots (AQDs) as an example, we show that NPs can be tailored to possess both targeting activity and therapeutic capability. In this study, AQDs exhibited a dose-dependent antiproliferative effect on HeLa cancer cells, indicating the possibility of using the obtained AQDs as highly effective dual-modality imaging probes for simultaneous cancer diagnosis and chemotherapy. In addition, the proposed one-pot approach can be extended to various other NPs (e.g., quantum dots, metal oxides, and metallic and magnetic materials) that can be successfully conjugated with folate via hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic immobilization during ultrasonication.

METHODS: 84 subjects were assigned to three groups (diabetic, prediabetic, and normal) according to the results of oral glucose tolerance tests. Beat-to-beat analysis was performed on the pulsatile LDF waveform to obtain foot delay time (FDT), flow rise time (FRT), and the corresponding MBF-variability parameters (FDTCV and FRTCV).

There were no significant associations for FRT after adjustment for age and gender. CONCLUSION: The present results indicate that FRT may help to discriminate differences in the elastic properties of local vascular beds during diabetes or even during prediabetic stages.

RESULTS: C1 was significantly larger whereas C4, CV2, and CV6 were significantly smaller in PCOS patients compared with healthy individuals. DISCUSSION: The results of the present study suggest that harmonic-analysis indexes of the BPWs could provide information about the arterial pulse transmission (by monitoring Cn) and cardiovascular regulatory activities (by monitoring CVn). These findings could aid the development of an easy-to-perform, noninvasive, and continuous monitoring technique to improve the detection of PCOS-induced hemodynamic changes. Copyright ?

The purpose of this study was to observe the functional improvement of the lower limbs upon rehabilitation low-level laser therapy (LLLT). All medical data were gathered from enrolled adults with sports-related lower leg pain. A total of 54 patients underwent triple-phase bone scans using skeletal nuclear scintigraphy, which confirmed periostitis in their lower limbs. The patients were then randomly divided into two groups: one group received laser therapy (N = 29) and the other group (N = 25) received an equivalent placebo treatment (a drug or physical therapy). Treatment protocol commenced with rehabilitation intervention and LLLT was performed three times daily for 5 days at a dosage of 1.4 J/cm2. A Likert-type pain scale was used to evaluate the severity of pain. Balance function, including postural stability testing (PST) and limits of stability (LOS), was also performed to evaluate the function outcome. Patients experienced a significant improvement in pain by day 2 or day 5 after starting LLLT, but here was no significant difference in pain scale between the measurements before (baseline) and after LLLT. Comparing the PST, the group differences of dynamic vs. static testings ranged from -18.54 to -50.22 (compared 12, 8, 4, 3, 2, 1 to 0, all p &lt; 0.0001), and the PST after LLLT were 3.73 units (p = 0.0258) lower than those of before LLLT. Comparing the LOS, the group differences of dynamic vs. static testing were similar to those in PST, and the relationship between LOS and groups only varied with the direction control during dynamic testing in direction at backward/right vs. right (p &lt; 0.0001). LLLT had a positive effect on proprioception in patients with lower limb periostitis. Larger, better controlled studies are needed to determine what specific effects LLLT has on the function of proprioception. ? 2014 Springer-Verlag.",Athlete; Balance; Diode laser; Pain; Proprioception; Runner; Sports medicine,"analgesic agent; benzodiazepine derivative; glucocorticoid; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; paracetamol; placebo; adult; adult disease; article; bone scintiscanning; burn; controlled study; dermatitis; diode laser; erythema; human; leg pain; light emitting diode; low level laser therapy; major clinical study; male; pain assessment; periostitis; priority journal; proprioception; prospective study; randomized controlled trial; sport injury; treatment duration; female; injuries; pathology; periostitis; radiation response; solid state laser; therapeutic use; tibia; treatment outcome; young adult; Adult; Female; Humans; Lasers, Semiconductor; Lasers, Solid-State; Low-Level Light Therapy; Male; Periostitis; Tibia; Treatment Outcome; Young Adult",2-s2.0-84903772804

DOX and a graft copolymer comprising acrylic acid (AAc) and 2-methacryloyloxyethyl acrylate (MEA) units as the backbone and with poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) and monomethoxy poly(ethylene glycol) as the grafts at pH 7.4 and 4 C undergo electrostatically induced co-association into copolymer/DOX nanocomplexes. After being crosslinked by polymerization of the MEA moieties, the complex nanoconstructs exhibit a unique nanogel-like architecture. Taking advantage of the extensive electrostatic attraction of the DOX molecules with ionized AAc residues and π-π stacking among copolymer-bound DOX molecules, the DOX-loaded nanogels show a relatively high payload content. With the milieu pH being reduced from 7.4 to 4.7, the drug release is appreciably promoted due to the massive disruption of ionic AAc/DOX pairings. The thermo-evolved phase transition of the PNIPAAm grafts further accelerates drug elution, particularly at pH 4.7. In vitro characterization indicates that the DOX-embedded nanogels endocytosed by HeLa cells can progressively release DOX within acidic organelles. As a result, the viability of cancer cells treated with DOX-loaded nanoparticles can be further reduced by prolonging incubation time. This work demonstrates the great potential of the DOX-loaded nanogel assemblies for effective intracellular drug delivery. ? 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Based on the environmental behaviour observation method, we drew 32 figures of moving lines accumulated for 7 h separately during the weekdays and weekend, incorporating sight-line analysis and staying circles to record users' usage of outdoor spaces. Next, we employed in-depth interviews with 10 recorded files and 67 structured questionnaires to analyse users' preferences regarding the usage factors of outdoor spaces and landscape elements. The results indicated that the outdoor leisure spaces of nursing homes can influence the desires of elderly people to live in nursing homes. Elderly people in this study typically felt that outdoor spaces could regulate their moods and influence physical health. Outdoor spaces surrounded by trees and flowers with shade and seating facilities that were not disturbed by the movement of cars or motorcycles were favoured.

This study qualitatively and quantitatively evaluates the imaging of transition into driven equilibrium of the balanced steady-state free precession (TIDE) compared with TSE and turbo gradient spin-echo on T2-weighted MR images. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty healthy volunteers were examined with T2-weighted images by using TIDE, TSE, and turbo gradient spin-echo sequences. Imaging was evaluated qualitatively by 2 independent observers on the basis of a 4-point rating scale regarding contrast characteristics and artifacts behavior. Image SNR and contrast-to-noise ratio were quantitatively assessed. RESULTS: TIDE provided T2-weighted contrast similar to that in TSE and turbo gradient spin-echo with only one-eighth of the scan time. TIDE showed gray-white matter differentiation and iron-load sensitivity inferior that of TSE and turbo gradient spin-echo, but with improved motion artifacts reduction on qualitative scores. Nonmotion ghosting artifacts were uniquely found in TIDE images. The overall SNRs of TSE were 1.9 -2.0 times those of turbo gradient spin-echo and 1.7-2.2 times of those of TIDE for brain tissue (P <.0001). TIDE had a higher contrast-to-noise ratio than TSE (P = .169) and turbo gradient spin-echo (P <.0001) regarding non-iron-containing gray matter versus white matter. TIDE had a lower contrast-to-noise ratio than turbo gradient spin-echo and TSE (P <.0001) between iron-containing gray matter and white matter.

It has become a staple for scientists to examine and subsequently begin to unravel the mystery of human diseases, and is increasingly used in toxicological studies for new drug development. The unique characteristics that this tiny fish possesses, including rapid growth rate, prodigious numbers of offspring, and eggs that develop outside the body, make it an invaluable genetic tool. Evidently, these advantages can be broadened with the addition of a properly designed microfluidic circuit.

To justify the effectiveness for this new set of classifiers, the g-mean and accuracy indices are used as performance indexes; moreover, the proposed classifiers are compared with previous literatures. Experimental results show that the hybrid algorithm of SMOTE + PSO + C5 is the best one for 5-year survivability of breast cancer patient classification among all algorithm combinations.

Methods: Sixty-six subjects were assigned to three age-matched groups according to the results of oral glucose tolerance tests. Beat-to-beat analysis was performed on the pulsatile LDF waveform to obtain the pulse-to-mean ratio (AD) and pulse width (PW), and then approximate-entropy (ApEn) values for their 20-minute index sequences were calculated to evaluate the signal complexity. Results: AD and PW did not differ significantly among the three study groups. ApEn values of AD and PW were significantly larger and marginally larger, respectively, in the diabetic group than in the prediabetic and normoglycemic groups. Conclusion: These results indicate the presence of significant differences in ApEn indexes among diabetic, prediabetic, and normoglycemic subjects.

Defect chemistry was studied by measuring structural and electrical properties of Mg-doped CZTSe as a function of dopant concentration. Except at x=0, all Mg-doped CZTSe pellets showed an n-type behavior. The Mg-doped CZTSe pellets showed an n-type behavior. n-Type Mg-CZTSe pellets at x=0.1 showed the highest electrical conductivity of 24.6 S cm -1 and the net hole mobility of 120 cm2 V-1 s-1, while they were 11.8 S cm-1 and 36.5 cm2 V-1 s-1 for the undoped p-type CZTSe. Mg dopant is a strong promoter of electrical mobility. Mg dopant behaves as a donor defect in CZTSe at a 5% doping content, but is also used as an acceptor at a high content above 5%. Mg doping has further developed CZTSe into a promising semiconductor. ? 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Electrical property; Extrinsic defect; Reactive sintering,Defects; Electric properties; Pelletizing; Semiconductor doping; Sintering; Bulk materials; Defect chemistry; Dopant concentrations; Electrical conductivity; Electrical mobility; Extrinsic defects; Reactive sintering; Structural and electrical properties; Magnesium,2-s2.0-84898620722

In this study, assessments on the safety profile of D-SPM were performed to complement the gene expression results. African green monkey kidney fibroblast (COS-7) and human adenocarcinoma breast (MCF-7) cells transfected with D-SPM/pDNA showed massive reduction in the number of viable cells. As for in vivo study, elevated level of neutrophils was observed, despite the minimal level of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-12, IFN-γ detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of mice treated with the D-SPM/pDNA complexes. Histology profile examinations of the lungs showed mild inflammatory responses, with inflamed areas overlap with healthy areas. Although reduction of mice weight was seen at day 1 post administration, the mice did not show any sign of abnormal behavior or physical appearance. Biodistribution study was performed to determine the ability of the D-SPM/pDNA complexes to infiltrate to other non-intended organs. The result showed that the D-SPM/pDNA complexes were only localized at the lung and no gene expression was detected in other organs or blood. In short, these results indicate that the D-SPM/pDNA exhibited mild toxicity in the mouse lungs.

The compounds were isolated as air-stable solids and fully characterized by IR and far-IR spectroscopy, MS(ESI+/-), elemental analysis, cyclic voltammetry (CV), controlled potential electrolysis, and single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Electrochemical studies showed that 1 and 2 undergo single-electron irreversible CoII→ CoIII oxidations and CoII→CoI reductions at potentials measured by CV, which also allowed, in the case of dinuclear complex 1, the detection of electronic communication between the Co centers through the chloride bridging ligands. The electrochemical behavior of models of 1 and 2 were also investigated by density functional theory (DFT) methods, which indicated that the vertical oxidation of 1 and 2 (that before structural relaxation) affects mostly the chloride and pyrazolyl ligands, whereas adiabatic oxidation (that after the geometry relaxation) and reduction are mostly metal centered. Compounds 1 and 2 and, for comparative purposes, other related scorpionate and pyrazole cobalt complexes, exhibit catalytic activity for the peroxidative oxidation of cyclohexane to cyclohexanol and cyclohexanone under mild conditions (room temperature, aqueous H2O2). Insitu X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies indicated that the species derived from complexes 1 and 2 during the oxidation of cyclohexane (i.e., Ox-1 and Ox-2, respectively) are analogous and contain a CoIII site. Complex 2 showed low invitro cytotoxicity toward the HCT116 colorectal carcinoma and MCF7 breast adenocarcinoma cell lines. Oxidizing cyclohexane: CoII- pyrazole complexes are catalyst precursors for the partial oxidation of cyclohexane with H2O2. The catalytic activity tends to increase with a decrease in the oxidation potential and the absence of basic substituents. Insitu X-ray absorption spectroscopy studies suggest the involvement of a common oxidized mononuclear CoIII species.

A standard deviation (SD) method was used to rapidly identify cardiac quiescent phases employing multiphase cine cardiac images. The accuracy of this method was investigated using 46 datasets acquired from 22 healthy volunteers. The possibility of using a low-resolution FB method to rapidly acquire cine images was also evaluated. The reproducibility and accuracy of the trigger delay obtained using the rapid calibration scanning process were assessed before its application to a real-time feedback system. The real-time trigger delay calibration system was then used to perform T1-weighted, short-axis imaging at the end of the cardiac systolic period. Linear regression analysis of the trigger times obtained using the SD method and a reference method indicated that the SD algorithm accurately identified the cardiac rest period (linear regression: slope=0.94-1, R2=0.68-0.84). Group analysis showed that the number of pixels in the left ventricular blood pool in images acquired at the end-systolic time calculated in real time was significantly lower than in those acquired 50 ms in advance or later (p&lt;0.01, paired t-test). The low-resolution FB imaging method was reproducible for the calibration scanning of an image in a vertical long-axis slice position (average SD of trigger times, 16-39 ms). Combined with rapid FB calibration scanning, the real-time feedback system accurately adjusted the trigger delay for T1-weighted short-axis imaging. The real-time feedback method is rapid and reliable for trigger time calibration, and could facilitate cardiac imaging during routine examination. ? 2014 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",Cardiac imaging; Real time; Trigger delay,"Blood pressure; Heart; Regression analysis; Scanning; Automatic calibration; Cardiac imaging; Cardiac rest periods; Healthy volunteers; Real time; Real-time feedback; Standard deviation; Trigger delay; Calibration; adult; algorithm; analytic method; article; automatic calibration; blood analysis; breathing; calibration; cardiac imaging; cardiac rest period; cardiovascular magnetic resonance; diagnostic accuracy; feedback system; female; free breathing; heart cycle; heart left ventricle endsystolic volume; human; human experiment; image processing; linear regression analysis; male; medical examination; normal human; priority journal; radiological parameters; reproducibility; rest; systolic blood pressure; young adult; cardiac imaging; real time; trigger delay; Adult; Automation; Calibration; Computer Systems; Diastole; Feedback; Female; Heart; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Systole; Time Factors",2-s2.0-84895924178
